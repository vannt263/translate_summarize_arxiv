    "many studies have been done on low mass - star formation in detail , theoretically and observationally , over the past two decades .",
    "these studies were possible because many low mass protostellar cores are close , isolated , and geometrically simple .",
    "in addition , they evolve slowly , allowing the process to be observed in distinct stages .",
    "the information accumulated by those studies now provides the big picture of the evolutionary stages of low - mass star formation .",
    "lada ( 1987 ) , myers & ladd ( 1993 ) and andr et al .",
    "( 1993 ) developed an evolutionary sequence based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of dust continuum emission through class 0 to class iii sources , and adams et al .",
    "( 1987 ) supported the evolutionary sequence by modeling the sed theoretically .",
    "in addition , several groups ( larson 1969 , penston 1969 , shu 1977 , shu et al .",
    "1987 , foster & chevalier 1993 , ciolek & mouschovias 1994 , mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 ) have developed dynamical evolution models that theoretically predict different structures of density and velocity in protostellar cores , based on differing initial conditions .    in spite of the big picture of low - mass star formation , the initial collapse is poorly understood .",
    "the collapse dynamics and the timescale of evolution are crucially dependent on initial conditions .",
    "preprotostellar cores ( hereafter ppcs ) are believed to be gravitationally bound , but they have no central hydrostatic protostar ( ward - thompson et al . 1994 , 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , ppcs can be considered as the potential sites of future star formation and give us chances to probe the initial conditions of star formation .",
    "the series of papers of ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1999 , 2000 , and 2001 ) and the paper of andr et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued that the density of ppcs is relatively constant in the inner cores and falls off at larger radii .",
    "this is very different from the singular isothermal sphere that leads to the  inside - out \" collapse ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "however , they assumed a uniform temperature in ppcs to calculate density structures .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and zucconi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that the temperature of a dust grain decreases toward the centers of ppcs , assuming that dust grains are heated only by the attenuated external radiation field and that the radiation from the core itself is optically thin . based on their results , evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that the continuum emission is significantly dependent on the temperature structure as well as the density structure , and they show that bonnor - ebert spheres can fit well the submillimeter dust continuum emission in ppcs . in agreement , the recent paper of ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) has shown that the color temperatures of ppcs that are calculated from the 170 and 200 @xmath4 dust emission observed by isophot decrease toward their centers . as a result of the lower temperature at the center",
    ", the density at the center must be more peaked than is the intensity of dust continuum emission .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that even a power law could fit the density structure of l1544 .",
    "ciolek & mouschovias ( 1994 ) modeled ambipolar diffusion for the quasi - static evolution of a uniformly magnetized isothermal molecular cloud , finding relatively constant density toward the center .",
    "however , there has been debate about the importance of ambipolar diffusion because of differences between inward velocity observed ( tafalla et al .",
    "1998 , williams et al . 1999 ) and calculated from the magnetic field ( goodman and heiles 1994 , andr et al .",
    "1996 , ward - thompson et al . 1999 ,",
    "crutcher and troland 2000 , ward - thompson et al . 2000 ) .",
    "those differences might be resolved by calculating more accurate density structure and , in turn , the correct temperature structure from the observed data .",
    "ciolek and basu ( 2000 ) showed if the density at the center of a ppc were higher , then their model could explain the observed magnetic field and inward velocity .",
    "in addition to density and temperature distributions , we need to understand the ionization structure because magnetic relaxation by ambipolar diffusion is tightly related to the ionization structure ( rawlings 2000 ) .",
    "ionization fraction can affect the process of gravitational collapse because the coupling between ions and magnetic field plays a key role in preventing free - fall collapse of a dense core and slowing the drift of neutral gas through the magnetic field ( ambipolar diffusion ) .",
    "in addition , the gas - phase chemical reactions depend significantly on ionization fraction , and the ionization fraction is highly sensitive to the depletion of molecules because some molecules play a crucial role in destroying ions . the degree of ionization in cold dense cores can be measured by the @xmath5/[hco^+]$ ] abundance ratio ( watson 1977 ) , which is directly related to the electron density and depletion fraction .",
    "recently , many molecular line observations show evidence for chemical differentiation and the depletion of some molecules such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and ccs in dense cores ( lada et al .",
    "1994 , kuiper et al .",
    "1996 , black et al .",

    "caselli et al . 1999 ,",
    "jessop and ward - thompson 2001 , tafalla et al . 2002 ) .",
    "they suggested that this trend is due to the substantial depletion of molecules onto dust grain surfaces .",
    "in addition , several groups ( bergin and langer 1997 , aikawa et al .",
    "2001 , caselli et al .",
    "2002 , li et al .",
    "2002 ) modeled chemical evolution , including gas - dust interaction as well as gas - gas interaction , to show the changing depletions of some molecules and ionization fraction with time or density , and most of them compared their results to real observations .",
    "therefore , both gas phase chemical processes and dust - gas interactions should be considered in studying star formation .",
    "those theoretical and observational results suggest that the relative distributions of several molecules can be used to probe the timescale of the dynamical evolution of a ppc .",
    "however , rawlings et al . (",
    "1992 ) and rawlings and yates ( 2001 ) modeled several molecular lines combining self - consistently dynamical , chemical , and radiative transfer models , and showed that the abundance variation and the line profiles are very sensitive to the free parameters in the chemical model . consequently , we need to use multiple transitions and maps in order to constrain these models .    in this paper ,",
    "we explore the chemical and dynamical differences in three ppcs ( l1512 , l1544 , and l1689b ) comparing molecular depletion and ionization fraction by simple analysis of integrated intensity and column density and by modeling several molecular line profiles in detail . in this study",
    ", we cover a very early - time molecule ( ccs ) , an early - time molecule ( co ) , a middle - time molecule ( @xmath0 ) , and a very late - time molecule ( @xmath2 ) in chemical evolution . according to the chemical models of bergin and langer ( 1997 ) and aikawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that used an initial density of @xmath8 @xmath9 , the ccs abundance decreases rapidly after a few times @xmath10 years since ccs is a polar molecule , and it is easily frozen out onto the surface of dust grains . in addition , ccs is destroyed by hco@xmath11 or h@xmath12o@xmath11 , whose abundances increase until about @xmath13 years .",
    "even though co is a non - polar molecule , it has very high binding energy ( 1740 k onto water ice mantle grains , bergin and langer 1997 ) . as a result ,",
    "co starts to be depleted onto the surface of dust grains after about @xmath13 years causing the depletion of hco@xmath11 in turn .",
    "hco@xmath11 is formed by the interaction between h@xmath14 and co or h@xmath15d@xmath11 and co. however , n@xmath15 , which is the precursor of n@xmath15h@xmath11 , starts to be abundant much later than other molecules and reaches its maximum around @xmath16 years .",
    "n@xmath15 has low binding energy ( 750 k , aikawa et al .",
    "2001 ) onto the surface of dust grains , so it is not frozen out from the gas phase easily .",
    "in addition , h@xmath14 , which is the other precursor of n@xmath15h@xmath11 , increases as co is depleted .",
    "another cause of the enhancement of n@xmath15h@xmath11 at late times is the decline of the destruction of n@xmath15h@xmath11 by co , which is significantly depleted at late times .",
    "we observed multiple positions in each core to study the chemical distribution within a core in addition to studying the chemical differences among the three ppcs .",
    "the most important aspect of this study is that we start with reasonable physical models calculated from dust analysis .",
    "the density and temperature structures found by evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are adopted for modeling molecular line profiles .    in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize observational parameters , and section 3 shows the results of observations . in section 4 , we analyze column densities of several molecules . section 5 compares modeled molecular line profiles and observed line profiles .",
    "finally , we discuss our results regarding depletion and ionization in the view of chemical and dynamical evolution in section 6 .",
    "we observed the three pre - protostellar cores in 18o ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , 17o ( @xmath17 ) , dco@xmath11 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath0 ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 ( @xmath18 ) with the 10.4 m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) at mauna kea , hawaii from 1995 to 2002 .",
    "we used an sis receiver with an acousto - optic spectrometer ( aos ) with a 50 mhz bandwidth and 1024 channels , and the frequency resolution was about 2 to 2.5 channels , 0.13 to 0.16 @xmath20 at around 220 ghz .",
    "the pointing uncertainty was about 4@xmath21 on average .",
    "we also observed these cores in @xmath19 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath2 ( @xmath22 ) , and ccs ( @xmath23 ) with the 45 m telescope of the nobeyama radio observatory in japan on january 2002 .",
    "we used the s40 , s80 , and s100 receivers with an aos with 40 mhz bandwidth and 2048 channels .",
    "the frequency resolution was about 2 channels ( about 40 khz ) so that the velocity resolution was about 0.27 , 0.14 , and 0.13 km s@xmath24 at 43 , 86 , and 100 ghz , respectively .",
    "the observed sources are listed in table 1 ; the observed lines and the main beam efficiency ( @xmath25 ) of each observation are summarized in table 2 . in table 1 ,",
    "the last column shows the offsets of the dust peaks from the given coordinates ; all offsets in figures other than figure 2 and 3 are relative to the dust peak , assumed to be the center of the core in all modeling .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectra of molecular lines observed toward the centers of the three ppcs .",
    "the centers are the positions of the centroid of the dust emission ( shirley et al .",
    "most of the molecular lines have not been mapped completely but observed through two orthogonal cuts in @xmath26 , crossing at the centers of dust emission in the cores .",
    "we do not see any consistent trend in the intensity of each spectrum from core to core .",
    "for example , 18o and 17o lines are the strongest in l1689b , but @xmath2 and ccs are the strongest in l1544 .",
    "all the lines except for @xmath2 and ccs are much weaker in l1512 than in l1689b .",
    "the line width ( fwhm ) of the 18o @xmath17 line is about 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.6 km s@xmath24 in l1512 , l1544 , and l1689b , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows maps of three ppcs , where the grey scale indicates 850 @xmath4 dust continuum intensity and the contours are for integrated intensities of @xmath7 @xmath17 and @xmath1 @xmath18 lines .",
    "we can see that the peaks of dust emission and @xmath7 @xmath17 emission are not consistent . in the map for l1512 , especially , the centroid of the dust emission coincides with a hole in the @xmath7 @xmath17 emission .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of @xmath1 @xmath18 emission appears to peak toward the center of dust emission in l1544 and l1689b , even though our maps of @xmath1 @xmath18 emission are not complete .",
    "in this section , we use a simple analysis with standard techniques for comparison to similar work done by others , and , in the next section , we will deal with detailed models .",
    "we use dust emission as the tracer of column density least affected by chemistry in this section , and we assume that the dust emissivities do not change with radius . if temperature decreases toward the center , the column density calculated from dust emission with the assumption of an isothermal case could be underestimated toward the center . even though the absolute column density calculated from the dust emission",
    "can change with the assumed dust opacity by a factor of 2 or 3 , its relative distribution with radius can be traced relatively well by dust emission .",
    "we can compare the distribution of a molecular component with that of the dust component within a core using the integrated intensity of an optically thin molecular line and the dust continuum intensity observed at a submillimeter wavelength . in the upper panels of figure 3 , we plot the logarithmic integrated intensities of ccs @xmath23 , h@xmath27co@xmath11 @xmath22 , and @xmath2 @xmath28 lines in order to compare to the 850 @xmath4 dust continuum intensity through the cuts with constant declination shown in figure 2 .",
    "the dust continuum intensity and the h@xmath27co@xmath11 intensity have been shifted upward to compare the shapes of intensity distributions with radius more effectively , and the intensity of dust continuum has been measured into apertures of 20@xmath21 , spaced by 20@xmath21 for consistency with the h@xmath27co@xmath11 and @xmath2 observations .",
    "the dust emission of l1512 is about half of that of l1544 , and the distribution is not as peaked as that of l1544 and l1689b . l1544 and l1689b have similar dust emission even though it is more peaked in l1544 .",
    "however , the ccs intensity of l1689b is more similar to that of l1512 rather than to that of l1544 , and the ccs intensity of l1544 is about twice those in l1512 and l1689b .",
    "the ccs intensity in all the three ppcs is not peaked as much toward the center as the dust emission .",
    "however , it has a bump toward the centers of l1512 and l1544 ( see  6.1 ) . in l1689b ,",
    "the bump is not certain because of the low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "if we check the relative variations of the integrated intensity of the @xmath3 @xmath22 line with radius in each core , in l1689b , it is skewed to the west but follows well the dust continuum emission , decreasing at the edge of the core . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of the integrated intensity of the @xmath3 @xmath22 line in l1512 is not well matched with dust continuum , and the integrated intensity is even depressed toward the center .",
    "we also see the depression of @xmath3 emission at the center of l1544 .",
    "this depression was predicted by caselli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in their chemical models , but not observed , probably because their angular resolution ( 28@xmath21 ) was worse than ours ( 18@xmath21 ) .",
    "we suspect that the optical depth of the @xmath3 @xmath22 line in l1544 and l1689b is not negligible .",
    "therefore , the depression in those cores could be partially caused by optical depth .",
    "however , l1689b does not show a depression even though it has a density structure similar to l1544 suggesting that depletion is playing a major role in l1544 .",
    "the @xmath2 intensity is well peaked in l1544 and shows almost the same shape as the dust emission .",
    "l1689b also shows similar shapes in dust emission and @xmath2 intensity . however , the @xmath2 intensity of l1689b is only two thirds of that of l1544 , even though these two cores have very similar dust emission and density structures , with central densities of @xmath13 @xmath9 . in l1689b , the peak of the intensity of @xmath2",
    "is shifted from that of the intensity of the dust emission similarly to the intensity of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the ratio of the intensity of @xmath3 to the intensity of @xmath2 at the center of l1689b , is greater than that in the other two cores .    in l1512 , with a central density of @xmath10 @xmath9 , @xmath2 emission is more extended than the dust , unlike in the other cores . since the optical depth of the @xmath2 @xmath22 line in l1512 is smaller than in l1544 ( benson et al .",
    "1998 ) , this might indicate the possible presence of depletion at the dust peak .    in the following section",
    ", we compare the distributions of co isotopes to that of dust emission by using molecular hydrogen column densities calculated from them instead of using the intensity distribution because the optical depth effect in the c@xmath29o line can be calculated , and the standard abundance of co is known .",
    "we compare the @xmath30 column densities calculated from observed molecular line intensities with that calculated from submillimeter continuum emission .",
    "this simple analysis assumes that 1 ) dust continuum emission traces all material along a line of sight in a core , and dust and gas are well mixed , 2 ) the core is isothermal , and dust and gas are well coupled so that they have same temperature , 3 ) molecular abundances are constant through the core , and 4 ) all levels are in lte . therefore , the excitation temperatures in all levels are the same as the kinetic temperature and the same as the dust temperature .",
    "if we assume a line is very optically thin so that absorption can be completely neglected , the equation of radiative transfer is given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the number density of upper level , and @xmath34 is the einstein coefficient .",
    "for the transition @xmath35 in a linear molecule , the resulting relation between @xmath36 , the column density of molecule @xmath37 , and the integrated intensity of the line , is    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the rotational constant , @xmath41 is the excitation temperature above the ground state , @xmath42 is the dipole moment , and @xmath43 is the partition function",
    ". equation 2 is valid only in the limit that @xmath44 . for finite optical depth",
    ", an optical depth correction can be applied :    @xmath45    in principle , one should also correct for the presence of the cosmic background radiation , @xmath46 , but for the lines considered here , at @xmath47 mm , the planck function in temperature units is less than 0.23 k , completely negligible compared to likely values of @xmath41 .",
    "the effect on @xmath36 of neglecting @xmath46 is less than 5% for @xmath48 k and @xmath49 , typical of the conditions relevant here .",
    "these effects are less than any plausible calibration uncertainty .    the rotational constant and the dipole moment of each molecule used for this calculation",
    "are listed in table 3 . for the excitation temperature",
    ", we used the kinetic temperature of 10 k , a typical value in dark molecular clouds , under the assumption that all lines are thermalized , that is , @xmath50 k. if we use 20 k for this calculation , the result is changed only by a factor of 1.2 for the @xmath17 line of 18o and 17o .",
    "we calculated the column densities using @xmath7 @xmath17 and @xmath6 @xmath17 lines .",
    "first , the lines were assumed to be optically thin .",
    "however , we can calculate the optical depth of the @xmath6 @xmath17 line directly by comparing the relative intensities of its 9 hyperfine components ( ladd et al .",
    "the optical depth of the @xmath6 @xmath17 line was obtained by a fitting method in the program class .",
    "the panels in the third row of figure 1 shows the results of fitting the hyperfine components of the @xmath6 @xmath17 line in the center of each core .",
    "the total optical depths for l1544 and l1689b are not small enough to be ignored ( table 4 ) , even though each individual hyperfine component is optically thin . in order to correct for this optical depth effect , we applied equation ( 3 ) to the above calculation for an optically thin line . for the 17o  @xmath51 line , @xmath52 is the optical depth of the line center that is calculated by multiplying the relative strength ( 0.693 ) of the main group , which has four close components , by the total optical depth .",
    "the correction factors at the centers of l1544 and l1689b are about 1.4 .",
    "note that we do not use the excitation temperature of 17o @xmath17 obtained by fitting the hyperfine structure to calculate the column density of 17o because this method assumes that @xmath41 is constant along the line of sight .",
    "our detailed models ( see  5.3.1 ) shows that this assumption leads to incorrect results .",
    "also we want to use the same method for 18o and 17o and compare the results .    finally , we convert the column density of each molecule into the @xmath30 column density using the abundance ( @xmath53 ) of molecule @xmath37 ;    @xmath54    we used a co abundance of @xmath55 ( lacy et al .",
    "1994 ) , about three times bigger than the abundance used in other studies such as bacmann et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and jorgensen et al .",
    "the abundance ratios [ co/18o ] and [ 18o/17o ] are about 560 ( @xmath56 25 ) and 3.2 ( @xmath56 0.2 ) , respectively ( wilson and rood , 1994 ) .",
    "the abundance of each molecule used in calculating the @xmath30 column density is listed in table 3 .",
    "if the emission from dust is optically thin , the observed flux density ( @xmath57 ) can be related to the column density of gas by    @xmath58    where @xmath42 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath59 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath60 is the mass opacity of dust per gram of gas , @xmath61 is the planck function , and @xmath62 is the aperture solid angle .",
    "@xmath63 for a circular gaussian aperture .",
    "we use column 5 of the ossenkopf - henning dust opacity table ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) , which represents agglomerated dust grains with thin ice mantles , and assume a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 to get @xmath64 .",
    "we use the 850  data from shirley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) but measure the flux in an aperture of 33@xmath21 , the size of main beam in the observations of c@xmath29o . if the dust temperature , @xmath65 is 10 k , the @xmath30 column density can be calculated from    @xmath66    if the temperature were 20 k , the calculated @xmath67 would be lower by a factor of 3.3 .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath17 and @xmath6 @xmath17 lines have been used to calculate the @xmath31 column density assuming constant molecular abundances .",
    "basically , we assume the lines are optically thin .",
    "if a molecular line is optically thick , then the calculation with equation ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) underestimates the @xmath31 column density .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , however , we can calculate the optical depth of the @xmath6 @xmath17 line by fitting its hyperfine structure .",
    "we have corrected the column density of the @xmath6 @xmath17 line for optical depth in l1544 and l1689b even though the correction is not very big .",
    "the results of fitting the hyperfine components of 17o @xmath17 show that the total optical depth of this line is about 0.1 in l1512 , but it is not negligible at the central positions in l1544 ( @xmath68 ) and l1689b ( @xmath69 ) . in l1512 ,",
    "the error of the calculated optical depth is very big , because of the low s / n in the weak components . however , the ratio ( @xmath70 4.3 ) between the strongest component and the second strongest component in l1512 is bigger than that ( @xmath70 3.3 ) in the two other cores , so the total optical depth would be less than that of l1689b , at least .",
    "the abundance of 18o is about 3.2 times greater than that of 17o .",
    "therefore , the optical depth of 18o is about 3.2 greater than the total optical depth of 17o , and the optical depth of 18o @xmath17 must be considered in calculating column densities .",
    "we plot the @xmath31 column density calculated from the 17o @xmath17 line in the lower panes of figure 3 , where the optical depth effect has been corrected by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "however , in the figure , we use the @xmath31 column density calculated from the 18o @xmath17 line based on the optically thin line approximation without correcting for its optical depth in order to show the significance of the optical depth effect .",
    "in fact , 17o has been observed in fewer positions so that we can not calculate the optical depth of every 18o spectrum .    in the figure",
    ", we see significant differences between the @xmath31 column densities calculated from the 850 @xmath4 emission and the 18o @xmath17 line in all three ppcs . at central positions , the @xmath31 column density calculated from the 18o @xmath17 line is about 15 times smaller in l1512 and l1544 , and 8 times smaller in l1689b than the @xmath31 column densities calculated from the @xmath71 @xmath4 emission .",
    "however , after correcting for the optical depth of the 17o @xmath17 line , the difference between the @xmath31 column densities calculated from @xmath71 and from 17o has been reduced . in l1689b ,",
    "especially , the difference is just a factor of 2 after the correction .",
    "another interesting thing is that the distribution of 17o in l1544 does not show the central depression observed in caselli et al .",
    "this is probably due to the larger beam ( 33 ) in this observation compared to that ( 21 ) of caselli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , similarly to the case of h@xmath27co@xmath11 ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "this result suggests that inadequate resolution can prevent us for calculating the actual depletion of molecules .",
    "the integrated intensities and the @xmath31 column densities calculated from several molecules have been compared with the intensity of 850 @xmath4 dust emission and the @xmath31 column densities calculated from the dust emission in our simple analysis of molecular line observations .",
    "the first result of this analysis is that the dust emission is more peaked than the molecular emission .",
    "the depression of molecular emission toward the centers is partially caused by the optical depth effect on molecular lines .",
    "we could see this effect comparing the column densities calculated from 17o @xmath17 ( marginally optically thin and corrected by @xmath72 ) and 18o @xmath17 ( optically thick but not corrected by @xmath72 ) lines . the correction for the optical depth effect by the 17o @xmath17 line removes some of the difference between the @xmath31 column densities calculated from the 18o @xmath17 line and dust emission .",
    "the remaining considerable discrepancy would be caused by the depletion of co molecules .",
    "this result shows that we can overestimate the depletion of a molecule if we use an optically thick line without correcting for the optical depth .",

    "we will explore the depletion in detail through modeling molecular line profiles using the monte carlo method in the next section .",
    "we emphasize that the amount of the discrepancy varies from core to core .",
    "after the correction for the optical depth effect , the @xmath31 column density calculated from the 17o @xmath17 line is 11 in l1512 , 9 in l1544 , and 2 in l1689b times smaller than the @xmath31 column density calculated from dust emission ( table 5 ) .",
    "the simple method used in this analysis clearly reveals evidence for depletion , but it has several limitations for quantitative analysis .",
    "first , the beam size of each line observation is not the same .",
    "if we had mapped these cores completely in each line , then we would have been able to convolve the maps using the same beam size .",
    "second , the variations of the excitation temperature and the abundance of a molecule along the line of sight are not included in this simple analysis .",
    "in addition , the absolute @xmath31 column density calculated from dust emission may be uncertain by a factor of 2 to 3 because of the uncertainty of dust opacity . due to these limitations",
    ", we have to model molecular lines and compare them to the observed lines in order to study depletion more in detail .",
    "we used the monte carlo ( hereafter mc ) method to calculate the radiative transfer of molecular lines ( bernes 1979 , choi et al .",
    "the mc code for this work has been developed by choi et al .",
    "the mc code generates model photons at a random position , in a random direction , and at a random frequency with proper random number distributions .",
    "these photons go through a one - dimensional spherically symmetric molecular cloud adjusting the level populations of molecules .",
    "the mc code calculates the excitation by the model photons and uses statistical equilibrium to adjust each level population until the criteria of convergence are satisfied .",
    "the mc method is more powerful than the lvg method because it can deal with arbitrary distributions of systematic velocity , density , kinetic temperature , microturbulence , and abundance self - consistently .",
    "therefore , we can combine reasonable physical models from analysis of dust emission with chemical models to produce molecular line simulations , and the depletion of molecules with radius can be tested .    for the mc simulation , we needed collision rates at lower gas temperatures than are usually available , so we extrapolated linearly to 5 k the collision rates for co ( flower and launay 1985 ) , which we used for 18o and 17o .",
    "similarly , we extrapolated the downward collision rates for @xmath0 ( flower 1999 ) to use for @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "upward rates were calculated for detailed balance for each isotope .",
    "the size of each core is fixed at 0.15 pc , and microturbulent velocity is assumed constant through each modeled core .",
    "once the mc code calculates each level population , we simulate specific molecular line profiles using the virtual telescope ( vt ) simulation to compare the modeled profiles with observed molecular line profiles .",
    "we can simulate a molecule with multiple transitions and multiple positions simultaneously in a specific core with the parameters such as beam sizes and main beam efficiencies that we used in the actual observations .",
    "the remaining lack of realism is caused by geometric differences between a 1-dimensional simulation and the actual core .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , the three cores are not perfectly spherically symmetric , but instead they are elongated . in order to compare simulated line profiles with real observations , we averaged the lines that have been observed at the same distance from the centers , e.g. , the lines in the off - positions of @xmath74 in @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "however , some lines have not been averaged in all four directions because the observation did not cover all parts .",
    "we need to map cores fully and use a 2-dimensional code to do more accurate comparisons .",
    "we model the transitions of four molecules , 18o ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , @xmath1 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath22 and @xmath18 ) , and @xmath0 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "if the gas and dust of a core are well mixed and well coupled , we can apply the distributions of density and temperature of the dust to the gas .",
    "however , for a density lower than about @xmath77 , the gas temperature is not coupled well with the dust temperature .",
    "the excitation temperatures of the lines that have high critical density such as @xmath1 and @xmath3 are mainly dependent on density so that the inner , denser region mainly contributes to the intensities of those molecular lines , and the outer , less dense region does not change our results much .",
    "however , we should in principle correct for the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the outer , less dense parts of cores , especially for the molecular lines such as 18o lines that have low critical density .",
    "we leave this correction for a future work .",
    "we use two different types of physical models : bonnor - ebert spheres ( bonnor 1956 , ebert 1955 ) ; and plummer - like models ( whitworth & ward - thompson 2001 ) .",
    "both these models allow an initial density distribution that is nearly constant for small radii , but approaches a power law at large radii .",
    "the bonnor - ebert sphere provides a good fit to the dust continuum emission of the three ppcs that we are modeling ( evans et al .",
    "the plummer - like model can fit the dust continuum data for l1544 ( whitworth & ward - thompson 2001 ) .",
    "it has the advantage that it provides a simple solution for the density and velocity field during a free - fall collapse from the initial state , thereby providing a velocity field , which we need for modeling some of our lines .",

    "we use the bonnor - ebert sphere model that best fit the dust emission ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ) , and we assume a purely microturbulent velocity field , except for the @xmath0 @xmath18 lines in l1544 and l1689b and the @xmath3 lines in l1544 . because those line profiles show deep self - absorption features indicative of systematic radial velocities , we use a plummer - like model for them . to constrain the various parameters in the plummer - like model , we modeled the dust emission , as was done by evans et al .",
    "the resulting values that fit best the data for both l1689b and l1544 are as follows : @xmath79 , the initial @xmath80 ( t=0 ) of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 of 2800 au .",
    "whitworth and ward - thompson found a steeper density structure ( @xmath83 ) and a bigger @xmath84 ( 5350 au ) because they used an isothermal sphere for their model .",
    "when the temperature decline toward the center is included , a smaller @xmath84 is needed .",
    "the evolutionary timescale that fits the dust emission well is half the timescale at which the central point - mass is formed ( the start of the class 0 stage ) .",
    "the maximum velocity in this model is about 0.08 km / s , which is consistent with the results of tafalla et al .",

    ", the resulting dust temperature structure is very similar ( figure 4b ) .",
    "the velocity field from the plummer - like model is shown in figure 4c .",
    "while the density and temperature structure of the best - fitting plummer - like model is very similar to that of the best fitting bonnor - ebert sphere , the former does contain a systematic velocity field . to check whether that field affected the results for lines modeled with the bonnor - ebert sphere",
    ", we modeled all other lines using the plummer - like model .",
    "the velocity structure does not affect the line profiles of 18o , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 ; the two models have given the same results .",
    "the main purpose of this modeling is to find how much a specific molecule is depleted , and how the depletion is distributed with radius by simulating molecular line profiles at multiple positions within a core and by comparing the simulated line profiles with observed line profiles .",
    "we tried several functional forms , such as exponential , power laws , plummer - like , and step functions , for the distribution of a molecular abundance .",
    "in addition , we applied the results of li et al.s dynamical and chemical model ( 2002 ) to our modeling , but their model has too high a systematic velocity to fit the observed molecular line profiles .",
    "however , the group is improving their chemical and dynamical models while communicating with us .",
    "figure 5 and table 6 shows the comparison between results of different functional forms of depletion with radius in the c@xmath85o 2@xmath731 line simulations .",
    "we used integrated temperatures to calculate @xmath86 in each model . among those distributions",
    ", a step functional distribution fits best the observed line profiles with radius .",
    "this seems reasonable because the results of chemical models show a sharp decrease in abundance with density or time .",
    "here , we mainly show the results of the modeling with the abundance distribution of a step function that has three free parameters : the undepleted abundance of a molecule ( @xmath87 ) , the fractional depletion ( @xmath88 ) , and the radius inside which a molecule is depleted ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "each can be different in different species .",
    "therefore , the total depletion of a molecule is dependent on the combination of @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "we emphasize that the derived depletion factor from this modeling has an uncertainty of about a factor of 3 because of the uncertainty of the density structure calculated from the dust analysis .",

    "the depletion radius is well constrained around 0.075 pc , but the fractional depletion is constrained only to be greater than about 25 .",

    "@xmath2 is not depleted in l1544 , but it is possibly depleted in l1512 .",
    "in contrast , only ccs is significantly depleted in l1689b .",
    "it is hard for us to estimate the depletion of co in l1689b because of the optical depth effect and the material surrounding the cores .",
    "the coupling between ions and the magnetic field is crucial in regulating star formation rates if cores are magnetically subcritical .",
    "the timescale of ambipolar diffusion depends on the ionization fraction ( @xmath121 , shu et al .",
    "in addition , the gas - phase chemical reactions are also dependent on the ionization fraction .",
    "therefore , calculating the ionization fraction accurately is significant for understanding the chemistry as well as the timescale for ambipolar diffusion .",
    "however , it is not easy to calculate the ionization fraction in protostellar cores because it depends on the depletions of molecules as well as density structures and cosmic - ray ionization rate .",
    "we used equation ( 16 ) in caselli ( 2002 ) to calculate the ionization fractions :    @xmath122/[hco^+]}-1.9\\times10^{-7}\\left[\\frac { 1}{\\rm f_d}+\\frac{\\rm x(o)/f^{'}_d}{10^{-4}}\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath123 is the depletion factor of co , x(o ) is the abundance of atomic oxygen ( @xmath124 , caselli et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath125 is the depletion factor of o , and @xmath5/[hco^+]$ ] is the abundance ratio of two molecules , which can be calculated by comparing the column densities of @xmath1 and @xmath3 and using 77 @xmath126 for the @xmath127 ratio ( wilson & rood 1994 ) .",
    "caselli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and caselli ( 2002 ) derived this equation assuming that ( i ) the main source of @xmath0 is the reaction between @xmath128 and co , ( ii ) the deuterium fractionation is due to the reaction between @xmath128 and hd , and ( iii ) molecular ions are destroyed mainly by electrons and neutral species such as co and o. in fact , caselli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have showed that n@xmath15h@xmath11 and n@xmath15d@xmath11 are better tracers of ionization fraction because hco@xmath11 and dco@xmath11 are possibly depleted in the central region .",
    "however , we do not have n@xmath15d@xmath11 data , so we use @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which can give correct information in the region with @xmath129 au .",
    "we calculate , for each line of sight , the average @xmath130 along the line of sight .",
    "this approach is not completely self - consistent because the method is only valid for homogeneous clouds .",
    "we use our model to simulate observation with the same beam size .",
    "the column density of each molecule has been calculated from the simulated line based on the assumption of an optical thin line .",
    "figure 12 shows the ionization fraction with radius in the three ppcs .",
    "there are some caveats in this calculation .",
    "first , we could not assess the depletion factor of co in l1689b correctly because of the optical depth problem and the possible material surrounding the core ( @xmath96 5.2.1 ) .",
    "second , the model of @xmath3 lines in l1544 does not match the observations very well so that the calculated column density from the simulated @xmath3 @xmath18 has more uncertainty .",
    "third , since we do not have enough observed data to assess the depletion radius of @xmath1 in l1512 , the column density of @xmath1 is uncertain in this core too .",
    "in addition to the caveats related to models , the equation that we used to calculate ionization fraction includes the abundance and the depletion fraction of o that are not well known .",
    "we supposed that the depletion of atomic oxygen might be proportional to the depletion factors of other molecules .",
    "we used @xmath125 of 3 , 2 , and 1 for l1512 , l1544 , and l1689b , respectively .    in spite of these caveats ,",
    "the three cores have similar average ionization fractions ( about @xmath131 ) along the line of sight toward the centers .",
    "these results are similar to the ionization fractions calculated in other protostellar cores ( caselli et al .",
    "1998 ) but much bigger than the result ( about @xmath132 at the center ) of caselli et al .",
    "caselli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have used the integrated temperatures of the actual line profiles , but caselli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have used the results of their ",
    "l1544 best - fit \" chemical model , which takes into account the cloud density structure , molecular freeze out , and the recombination of molecular ions on grain surfaces , in order to infer the electron fraction as a function of cloud radius .",
    "our data do not rule out still smaller values of @xmath130 at small radii .",
    "the ionization fraction in l1512 and l1544 decreases toward the center , which trend has been shown in caselli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and caselli ( 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , in l1689b , it increases toward the center . as a result , the ionization fraction of l1689b around 0.06 pc is smaller than those of l1512 and l1544 by a factor of 10 .      the timescale of ambipolar diffusion ( @xmath133 , shu et al .",
    "1987 ) calculated from the above ionization fraction toward the centers is about @xmath134 years .",
    "this timescale applies to cores that are magnetically subcritical .",
    "this ambipolar timescale represents the duration of contraction from the present stage to the stage of class 0 .",
    "these are much bigger than the free fall timescale ( @xmath135 years ) .",
    "however , @xmath130 could be much smaller at the center .",
    "even though these three cores have similar ambipolar diffusion timescale toward the centers , our results suggest that they have different chemical status from each other .",
    "l1512 seems to have evolved chemically more than l1544 showing that ccs , co , hco@xmath11 , and possiblely n@xmath15h@xmath11 are depleted .",
    "caselli ( 2002 ) modeled a core that is less dense and less centrally concentrated than l1544 to show the chemistry in an early stage in the dynamical evolution . according to their result ,",
    "molecules in the model core are not significantly depleted .",
    "the model core is similar to l1512 in density structure , but surprisingly , l1512 shows a bigger depletion radius of co than l1544 .",
    "in addition , n@xmath15h@xmath11 at the center of l1512 might start to be depleted .",
    "this result could result from the slower contraction of l1512 than l1544 so that l1512 could have a longer time to evolve chemically .",
    "another possibility is a more efficient molecular freeze out in l1512 because the dust grains in this object are smaller than in the other two cores , so that the depletion timescale in l1512 is shorter ( van dishoeck et al . 1993 ; caselli et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "this could be possible because l1512 is less dense than the other two cores and has not have enough time for grain coagulation ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "on the other hand , l1689b has not evolved much chemically even though the density structure is very similar to l1544 so that it is in a later stage of dynamical evolution than is l1512 .",
    "this tells us that the chemical evolution is not a simple function of density , unlike the results of other chemical models .",
    "according to this result , we should not ignore the possibility that l1689b could be magnetically supercritical , and the core has evolved faster than the other two sources dynamically so that l1689b has not had enough time to evolve chemically .",
    "the broader lines in l1689b ( figure 1 and @xmath96 3.1 ) indicate more active kinematics than the other two sources .",
    "the total masses of l1544 and l1689b are similar according to the dust modeling .",
    "therefore , l1689b has to have a weaker magnetic field or a smaller ionization fraction in order to be magnetically supercritical .",
    "crutcher & troland ( 2000 ) measured the magnetic field along the line of sight in l1544 ( @xmath136 @xmath42 g ) by using the zeeman effect of the oh lines .",
    "there is no specific measurement of magnetic fields in l1689b .",
    "however , troland et al . (",
    "1996 ) measured a oh zeeman effect in the @xmath99 oph cloud indicating @xmath137 @xmath42 g .",
    "in addition , our calculation shows the ionization fraction in l1689b is smaller than in the other two cores in the outer part , where the calculation is more credible .",
    "the other possibility of the faster dynamical evolution of l1689b than l1544 is a larger external pressure ( galli et al .",
    "2002 ) because l1689b is in the @xmath99 oph complex ( see  5.3.1 ) .",
    "based on our results , we suggest that the stage of dynamical evolution of a core can not be simply probed by its chemical status because the chemical evolution depends on the size of dust grains or the absolute timescale , during which the core has been in a given environment , as well as its density structure that shows the relative stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "we summarize the dynamical and chemical evolutionary stages of each core in table 11 .",
    "the summary of our results is as follows :    \\1 ) the difference between the column densities inferred from dust emission and the emission of a given molecular line can partially result from the optical depth of the line .",
    "however , the depletion of a molecule must explain the remaining difference . in l1689b , the main cause of the difference between the dust emission and the co emission",
    "is the optical depth in the lines .",
    "however , in l1512 , the depletion of co is the major source of the difference between the dust emission and the co emission .",
    "\\2 ) in our monte carlo simulation of molecular lines , a step function with depletion in the inner region produces the best fit to the abundance variation of a molecule in ppcs .",
    "\\3 ) the co and @xmath0 molecules are depleted significantly in l1512 and l1544 , but not in l1689b . the gas around l1689b makes it difficult to calculate the actual depletion of co.    \\4 ) the depletion of @xmath1 is not substantial in the three ppcs .",
    "\\5 ) the ccs molecule is substantially depleted in the three ppcs .",
    "however , ccs might be in the second enhancement in l1512 and l1544 because of the significant depletion of co.    \\6 ) the distribution of the integrated intensity of @xmath2 @xmath28 suggests the possible depletion of @xmath2 in l1512 . on the other hand , @xmath2 follows dust emission very well in l1544 . in l1689b , @xmath2 has not had enough time to reach its maximum .",
    "\\7 ) the velocity structures calculated by a simple dynamical model that uses a plummer - like density profile and a free - fall collapse model can produce the asymmetry of @xmath0 @xmath18 lines in l1544 and l1689b .",
    "however , the abundance calculated by modeling the lines is much smaller than what is expected from modeling @xmath3 .",
    "the surrounding gas could possibly account for the low @xmath0 abundance of the models .",
    "\\8 ) the ionization fraction is similar toward the centers of the three cores even though l1512 is less centrally condensed than l1544 and l1689b .",
    "however , l1512 has a bigger depletion radius of co than l1544 and possible depletion of n@xmath15h@xmath11 at the center .",
    "in contrast , l1689b does not show the maturity in chemical evolution compared to the other two cores .",
    "this difference suggests that the chemical evolution depends on the size of dust grains or the absolute timescale during which a core stays in a given environment as well as the density structure of the core that shows the relative dynamical evolutionary stage .",
    "\\9 ) the evolved density structure and the young chemistry of l1689b suggest that this core is possibly experiencing a free - fall collapse rather than ambipolar diffusion . as a result",
    ", l1689b evolves dynamically too fast to evolve chemically .",
    "this would be possible if the magnetic field in l1689b is weak enough , or the external pressure is big enough to make l1689b magnetically supercritical .",
