    "distant galaxies are now routinely detected and studied out to @xmath10 through a variety of approaches and techniques .",
    "these young galaxies represent the empirical limit to our current understanding of the formation of the first galaxies in the universe .",
    "the most common methods for locating these systems include : deep imaging , usually through hubble space telescope surveys ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ; stanway et al .",
    "2003 ) , narrow - band filter imaging searches ( e.g. , rhoads et al . 2003 ;",
    "kashikawa et al . 2006 ) , and deep blind spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , stark et al . 2007 ) . of interest to this paper , during the last few years , dozens of high redshift , @xmath11 , galaxies have been identified in deep hubble space telescope imaging , including the hubble ultra deep field ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter the udf ) , and the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004a ) , among others .",
    "both the udf , goods , and other surveys have been used to locate galaxies at @xmath5 , measuring and constraining , among other things , the global star formation rate history out to @xmath12 ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "2004b ; bunker et al . 2004 ; bouwens et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it appears from these observations that the star formation rate at early epochs is high , although not as high as the star formation rate peak at @xmath13 ( e.g. , bouwens et al . 2007 ) . based on _ spitzer",
    "_ imaging many of these galaxies are found to be quite massive , with stellar masses m@xmath14 @xmath15 ( e.g. , yan et al .",
    "2005 ; eyles et al . 2007 ) , as well as having stellar population ages suggesting the onset of their formation was several hundred million years earlier ( e.g. , yan et al . 2005 ; eyles et al . 2007 ; stark et al . 2007 ) .",
    "to probe higher redshifts , and to learn more through spectroscopy about the physical nature of already confirmed @xmath11 galaxies will likely require the next generation of 20 - 30 meter telescopes , and the _ james webb space telescope_. currently we do not know when the first galaxies formed , nor do we know much about the physical processes driving the formation of these earliest galaxies .",
    "a parameter space of these galaxies , which however has not been explored in any detail , is the structures and sizes of @xmath5 galaxies ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ; ravindranath et al . 2006 ; hathi et al . 2007 ) . nor has it yet been determined whether structural features of @xmath5 galaxies can reveal how the earliest galaxies are forming , and their connection to lower redshift systems ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "while galaxy images , even when studied with hst , do not provide the same kind of information as spectroscopy , imaging is in some cases more powerful than spectroscopy for determining how a galaxy population is evolving .",
    "the main reason is that with deep hubble imaging more galaxies can be studied in a given population than can possibly have spectroscopy reliably measured . in the case of individual @xmath11 galaxies , very little information beyond a redshift is provided by spectroscopy , although stacked spectra can provide more detailed information about gas outflows and other physical processes ( e.g. , vanzella et al .",
    "imaging on the other hand provides unique information for as many resolved galaxies that can be imaged with a high enough signal to noise ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the extreme depth and high resolution of the udf data allows us to probe the internal structures of these first galaxies . using known structural properties of @xmath16 galaxies ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "2008 ; lotz et al .",
    "2008a ) we can potentially determine the physical methods whereby these first galaxies formed , and their connection to lower redshift systems .",
    "we take a general approach to this problem in this paper by examining the qualitative and quantitative structures , and the incidence of likely merging pairs of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "our goal is to determine if the formation mechanisms for these very early galaxies can be studied using their resolved ultraviolet structures , and what we can learn about the earliest formation modes , and its history , by using these features .",
    "furthermore , understanding the structural properties and evolution of these first galaxies has profound consequences for cosmology and structure formation .",
    "theories of galaxy formation based on cold dark matter and a @xmath17dominated universe predict that galaxies form hierarchically , and this is especially true at these very early epochs . in",
    "cold dark matter dominated models , gas rich galaxies at @xmath5 collide and merge to form more massive systems , while at the same time triggering star formation , and the growth and assembly of central black holes .",
    "the relative role of discrete merger events as opposed to gas accretion from the intergalactic medium is debatable , with some current models predicting that accretion is the dominant method for building stellar mass at high redshifts ( e.g. , keres et al . 2005 ) .",
    "there is now strong observational evidence however that the merger process occurs at redshifts @xmath16 based on observations of the hubble deep field north and south , and the hubble ultra deep field ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; conselice et al .",
    "2004 ; lotz et al .",
    "2008a ; conselice et al .",
    "these earlier results found that the merger fraction and rate increase with increasing redshift , especially for the most massive and luminous galaxies , out to @xmath18 ( paper i ; paper iii ; bluck et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "observationally , the role of mergers in forming galaxies at @xmath19 is largely unconstrained .",
    "the hubble ultra deep field is perhaps our best opportunity to address this question within the next decade due to its unprecedented depth .",
    "there are several issues however that we must confront when utilising even very deep hubble space telescope data for this analysis at extreme redshifts , @xmath5 , where structural and morphological analyses have not previously been performed .",
    "these issues include , but are not limited to : the extreme cosmological surface brightness dimming , resolved galaxies , and morphological k - corrections .",
    "we discuss all of issues in this paper , as well as in conselice et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for galaxies at @xmath16 within the udf .",
    "overall , we examine in several ways the structures of @xmath5 galaxies as seen within the hubble udf field .",
    "this includes : investigating their apparent and quantitative structural features , the sizes of these early galaxies , the incidence of systems in pairs , and the relation of these quantities with the ongoing star formation rate .",
    "we interpret these observations to imply that there is a diverse , and likely rapidly changing , formation history for @xmath5 galaxies .",
    "we conclude that a substantial fraction of @xmath5 lbgs are possibly in a merger or rapid assembly phase , but we also find that a significant number of systems appear relaxed , with a well - defined correlation between the concentration of light and their half - light radii .",
    "we also give a description for how best to analyse extremely faint galaxy data sets which will be useful for future analyses using faint resolved galaxy images .",
    "this paper is organised as follows :  2 includes a discussion of the data sources we use in this paper , and the sample selection ,  3 is a description of our morphological and structural analyses methods ,  4 gives a detailed investigation into our errors and systematics associated with measuring structure on these galaxies ,  5 presents our analysis ,  6 is a discussion of our results and their implications , and finally  7 is our summary and conclusions .",
    "readers interested in skipping the technical details of our analysis are advised to read  3.1 &  3.2 , and from  5 onwards .",
    "we use a standard cosmology of h@xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , and @xmath22 = 0.3 throughout .",
    "the primary data source used in this paper are the acs and nicmos imaging of the hubble ultra deep field ( thompson et al . 2005 ; beckwith et al . 2006 ; udf ) .",
    "descriptions of the udf survey are included in e.g. , beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , coe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and references therein .",
    "the udf acs uses the same filter set as the goods survey , which are the f435w ( b@xmath23 ) , f606w ( v@xmath24 ) , f775w ( @xmath25 ) , and f850l ( @xmath26 ) bands .",
    "the udf programme used 400 orbits of hubble imaging for a total exposure time of just under 1 msec .",
    "the field of view of the acs image for the udf is 11 arcmin@xmath27 , and is located within the goods - south field .",
    "the central wavelengths of the filters we use , and their full - width at half - maximum , are : f435w ( 4297 , 1038  ) , f606w ( 5907 , 2342  ) , f775w ( 7764 1528  ) , f850l ( 9445 1229  ) the limiting magnitude for point sources is m@xmath28 in the @xmath29band at 10 @xmath30 within the udf images using a 2aperture , making the udf easily the deepest optical imaging taken to date .",
    "the other bands have similar 10 @xmath30 depths .",
    "further details concerning the udf imaging are presented in beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and coe et al .",
    "all structural analyses in this paper are done using the @xmath29band acs imaging .",
    "since we examine very faint and small galaxies within the udf , we discuss briefly some of the features of the data reduction , and the image quality of the acs imaging .",
    "first we note that we only use the @xmath29band f850l image for our analysis , to obtain the reddest wavelength possible without using nicmos imaging which has a psf size between 0.22 - 0.3 .",
    "the data products we use in this analysis originate mostly from the reduction and cataloguing from beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and coe et al .",
    "beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) provides a detailed description of the data reduction and data acquisition procedures for the udf , including the justification for the depth , field selection , and filter choices .",
    "beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also describes in some detail the data reduction and image quality tests which we summarise here .",
    "the udf was a major imaging campaign with the hubble space telescope utilising director s discretionary time .",
    "the udf data was acquired over a broken time - span from september 24 2003 until january 15 2004 , utilising various roll angles and dithering positions .",
    "the roll angles used to take the data : 40 , 44 , 310and 314 , were selected to obtain a nearly square final image , unlike for the goods imaging where various roll angles were used to optimise for supernova searches ( giavalisco et al .",
    "each acs observation of the udf consisted of 2 orbits , divided into two exposures per orbit , with typical single exposure times of 850 - 1200s ( beckwith et al .",
    "in addition to different roll angles , the udf images were dithered with sub - pixel sized shifts between exposures , in an attempt to obtain higher quality images through the drizzle process .",
    "the dither pattern used in the udf data acquisition was a four point dither of integer pixels combined with half - integer offsets to both increase the image quality , as well as to make easier the removal of bad pixels and columns , cosmic rays , and other defects .",
    "the resulting images were then combined , after sky subtraction through a method outlined in beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , using the multidrizzle programme .",
    "the main task of multidrizzle is to produce for each exposure a rectified output image on a common grid that are then all combined to create a single final image .",
    "the output pixel scale was set to 0.6 times the original acs wfc scale of 0.05pixel@xmath21 , for a final pixel scale of 0.03pixel@xmath21 which allows nyquist limited sampling of the point spread function .",
    "the output image was created such that each pixel in the image maps from a single pixel in the input images .",
    "this reduces the amount of processing on the images themselves , while providing the highest resolution possible with a limited amount of correlated noise .",
    "tests of the image quality of the psf based on stars reveals fwhm values of 0.089 in the @xmath29band ( see  3.3 for a more detailed discussion of this . )    the initial photometry for the udf galaxies were taken from the publicly available catalogs of the udf from beckwith et al .",
    "this catalog and photometry was obtained through the use of sextractor , including the use of the output segmentation maps , used later in the morphological analysis .",
    "the output from the sextractor process produces a catalog of photometry at various apertures , including total magnitudes , as well as other photometric , and some size measurements .",
    "output from the sextractor process includes a so - called segmentation map which is a matched map , aligned with the original image , and is constructed such that each pixel in the segmentation map is mapped to either a single galaxy or to the background .",
    "this is done to both define the galaxy for the photometry , as well as for the structural analysis we perform in this paper .",
    "the magnitudes we use are all based on this catalog , where we utilise the total mags from the sextractor output which gives a magnitude in each of the acs filters we examine : bv@xmath31 , which are then used for the lyman - break galaxy selection .",
    "our sample selection matches that used in previous lyman - break galaxy surveys of the great observatories origins deep survey ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "2004b ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ; ravindranath et al . 2006 ; lee et al .",
    "2006 ) which is designed to locate galaxies at @xmath32 and 6 .",
    "we utilise the so - called ` drop - out ' technique to find these galaxies , applying the criteria discussed in giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2004b ) and dickinson et al .",
    "these criteria are :    @xmath33 @xmath34    for b - drops , which are at @xmath35 . for the v - drops ( objects at @xmath36 ) we use the criteria :    @xmath37 , { \\rm or}\\ ] ] @xmath38,\\ , { \\rm and}\\ , ( v_{606 } - i_{775 } ) \\geq 1.2,\\ , { \\rm and}\\ ] ] @xmath39    finally , for the @xmath12 @xmath2drops we use the criteria ,    @xmath40    although high@xmath41 candidates have been selected and published in the udf area by yan & windhorst ( 2004 ) , bunker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we recompute our own samples .",
    "using the selection criteria above we obtain candidate objects at redshifts @xmath42 respectively , finding similar surface densities of drop - outs as these previous works .",
    "we include in this list the spectroscopically confirmed systems published in stanway et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , dickinson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and stanway et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , including the redshifts compiled in coe et al .",
    "we also place a magnitude limit of @xmath43 on our initial selection for drop - outs .",
    "we remove any point sources based on the stellaricity index calculated during the sextracting process .",
    "images of the @xmath44 @xmath2drops are shown in figure  1 .",
    "to 135 mm        [ sample - figure ]    we examined all of our candidate drop out systems by eye for classification purposes , as well as to remove contamination , such as lower redshift galaxies and stars .",
    "if a candidate drop - out is detected in a band bluer than the drop - out band , it is removed from consideration . in the case of the b - band drop - outs we use photometric redshifts and whether galaxies are detected in the b - band itself to remove lower redshift contamination , which we find to be very minor ( e.g. , bunker et al .",
    "we carry out this purging and classification by examining all of the acs wave - bands . after carrying out these procedures",
    "we find within the udf a total of 126 i - drops , 137 v - drops and 320 b - drops . for",
    ", in particular the @xmath2drops , there is the issue of contamination by lower - redshift galaxies , particular from evolved ellipticals at @xmath45 , and from galactic stars .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we remove any systems which are unresolved within our drop - out list , which in the udf is only a few systems , which are all brighter than mag @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , based on nir colours , the contamination rate for @xmath47 @xmath2drops is roughly 1 - 2% , much lower than the 1/3 contamination rate seen in the brighter drop - out systems ( e.g. , bunker et al .",
    "2004 ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "finally , we emphasis that we only use the @xmath29band acs imaging for our morphological / structural / size measurements . while the nicmos data sample longer rest - frame wavelengths for these galaxies",
    ", we do not use this imaging as the nicmos psf is much larger than it is for acs , making it very difficult to impossible to use for morphological measurements .",
    "we also apply a s / n cut of @xmath48 for our morphological analysis as well as an overall magnitude limit of @xmath49 ( figure  2 ) to only include systems that are bright enough for structural analyses (  4 ) .",
    "this leaves 69 b - drops , 43 v - drops and 21 @xmath2drops for this part of our analysis .",
    "in this section we describe our methodology for measuring the various properties of our drop - out sample . the procedure for doing this",
    "is explained below , but can be summarised briefly .",
    "each drop - out is cut - out from the udf image and examined in the @xmath29band by eye ( in  2 we explain how we also examined these galaxies in the other bands ) and classified according to the criteria in  3.1 .",
    "we then analysed these images through the cas code and method ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) , which provides measures of total radii ( petrosian radius ) , half - light radii , fluxes within the total radii , as well as the cas parameters themselves .",
    "to 110 mm     magnitude .",
    "the open red boxes are for b - drops , the solid black symbols are the v - drops , and the blue triangles are for the @xmath2drops in our sample .",
    "the horizontal line denotes our s / n limit and cut which we use throughout this paper .",
    "the vertical line is the magnitude limit in which we select our sample for the cas analysis .",
    ", width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    we use in this paper two methods for classifying our drop - outs .",
    "the first is a simple examination in the @xmath50-band of the apparent structure and morphology of each system .",
    "this is not meant to be definitive , nor is any physical meaning necessarily implied by these classifications .",
    "the second type of classification method involves a quantitative approach using a revised cas and gini/20 methodology introduced in conselice et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and described in more detail in  3.2 .",
    "we describe both methods and their limitations below .",
    "the first part of our analysis involves examining every drop - out in each of the four main udf acs bands , for various purposes (  2 ) .",
    "the process for carrying this out involves cutting out into a postage stamp - sized image each drop - out in the bv@xmath31 bands and then examining these images by eye to determine whether the galaxy appears in that given band , and if so , what its visual morphology is .",
    "figure  1 shows a @xmath44 selected @xmath2drop sample .",
    "the large number of drops in the other bands , prohibits showing the other samples .",
    "we do all of our classifications of types in the @xmath29band for all drop - outs . if a galaxy is detected and meets our analysis criteria , it is then classified into one of the following classes :    1 .",
    "normal - the galaxy is resolved and appears to have a normal , roughly symmetric , shape .",
    "elongated - the galaxy appears elongated 3 .",
    "neighbour - the galaxy is near another galaxy which is also a drop - out in the same band ; examples of these systems are shown in figure  3 4 .",
    "unusual / asymmetric / peculiar - the galaxy appears unusual in some way , typically asymmetric , with examples of these systems shown in figure  4 + to 150 mm +    + [ sample - figure ] + to 150 mm +    + [ sample - figure ] 5 .",
    "star - like - the object appears unresolved and very compact , such as a star .",
    "we use the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) parameters to measure the structures of our @xmath5 galaxies quantitatively .",
    "we include in our analysis the measurement of the gini and 20 parameters ( e.g. , lotz et al . 2008a ) .",
    "the cas / gini/20 parameters are a non - parametric method for measuring the forms of galaxies on resolved ccd images ( e.g. , conselice 1997 ; conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice 2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "the basic idea behind these parameters is that galaxies have light distributions that reveal their past and present formation modes ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this system is well calibrated at @xmath51 , and to a lesser degree at @xmath52 , but its use and applicability at @xmath5 remains untested until this paper .",
    "one of the major benefits of the cas system is that well - known galaxy types in the nearby universe fall into specific regions of cas parameter space .",
    "for example , the selection @xmath53 locates systems which are nearly all major galaxy mergers in the nearby universe ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000b ; conselice 2003 ; hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ; conselice 2006a ) .",
    "in addition to the classic cas parameters , we also investigate the use of the similar gini and m@xmath54 parameters ( lotz et al .",
    "2008a ) for understanding the morphologies of the udf galaxies .",
    "our method is the same as used in paper i ( conselice et al .",
    "a brief description of the parameters we use in this analysis is provided below .",
    "the way we measure these structural parameters on the udf images varies slightly from what has been done earlier in the hubble deep field , and early goods studies ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; mobasher et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "our basic procedure is to cut out each galaxy in our sample into a smaller image from which the entire analysis is done .",
    "the same part of the weight map and segmentation map is cut out as well .",
    "next the code measures the radius in which the parameters are computed .",
    "we use the sizes measured through the cas code , namely petrosian radii , and the half - light radii , throughout this paper .",
    "the total flux is then also measured within this petrosian total radius .",
    "the radius we use for all of our indices is the petrosian radii , which is the radius defined as the location where the surface brightness at a radius is 20% of the surface brightness within that radius ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) . as described in bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , for most galaxy profiles , this petrosian radius will contain 99% , or nearly all of the light in a galaxy .",
    "this radius has also been used in nearly all structural analysis studies at high redshift , and is even becoming a standard radius for measuring galaxy sizes in the nearby universe , such as within the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. , graham et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we use circular apertures for our petrosian radii , and for our quantitative parameter estimation .",
    "the reason we do not use elliptical or more complicated radii is to avoid ambiguity produced through assumptions about the shape of our galaxy sample .",
    "furthermore , many of our galaxies have such irregular and peculiar structures , that anything but a single circular aperture would be too complex to interpret through our structural methods .",
    "we begin our estimate of the galaxy centre for the radius measurement at the centroid of the galaxy s light distribution . through modelling and various tests",
    ", we have previously shown that the resulting radii do not depending critically on the exact centre , although the cas and other parameters do ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; lotz et al .",
    "the petrosian radius we use to measure our parameters is defined by :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the radius where the surface brightness is 20% of the surface brightness within that radius , or ,    @xmath57    this follows the suggested form given by kron ( 1995 ) , where the value of @xmath58 is equal to unity at the centre of a galaxy , and goes to zero at large galactic radii .",
    "typical petrosian radii for our sample typically range from 0.2 - 0.6 , while the half - light radii vary between 0.1 - 0.3(see  3.3 ) .",
    "the cas code furthermore measures the flux within this petrosian radius , where we measure our morphological and structural parameters . to test",
    "how well we are measuring the total light from these galaxies we compare the cas measured magnitude to the sextractor measured total magnitudes discussed in  2.1 in figure  5 .",
    "figure  5 shows that there is a good relation between the two measured magnitudes , with the average differences , and 1 @xmath30 variation on these differences for the various drop - outs : @xmath59mag = 0.03@xmath600.13 for the b - drops , @xmath59mag = 0.03@xmath600.12 for the v - drops , and @xmath59mag = 0.005@xmath600.13 for the @xmath61-drops .",
    "these differences are such that the sextractor magnitudes are slightly brighter than the cas measured ones by @xmath62 0.5 - 3% .",
    "most of the scatter is produced by the faintest galaxies , most of which we do not use in our analysis .    to 140 mm    -band magnitudes as measured with sextractor , as published and catalogued in beckwith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and those measured through the cas method and code within the @xmath63 radius as discussed in  3.2 .",
    "the black points are for the b - drops , the blue points are for the v - drops , and the red points are the @xmath2drops .",
    "we find a very good relation between these two methods of measuring the magnitudes for our sample (  3.2.1 ) . , width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    to 140 mm        [ sample - figure ]    another important issue , especially for faint galaxies seen in the udf , is how to account for background light and noise . for faint galaxies",
    "there is a considerable amount of noise from the sky , which must be accounted for . through various test",
    "we conclude that the proper way to correct parameters for the background requires that the selected background area be near the object of interest .",
    "this is only an issue for faint galaxies , and for galaxies imaged on large mosaics which have a non - uniform weight map , and whose noise characteristics vary across the field . by using a background near each object",
    "we alleviate these issues as the noise properties do not vary significantly over @xmath64 arcmin , where the galaxy and the background area are selected .",
    "we review below how the cas and gini/20 parameters are measured .",
    "for more detail see bershady et al .",

    "the asymmetry of a galaxy is measured by taking an original galaxy image and rotating it by 180 degrees about its centre ( defined below ) , and then subtracting the two images ( conselice 1997 ) . within this method",
    "there are corrections done for background , and radius , which are explained in detail in conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "briefly , the most important correction for the asymmetry index is the background light , and the noise within this .",
    "furthermore , we measure the asymmetry out to the petrosian radius , although other similar radii give very similar results ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2000a ) .",
    "the centre for rotation is decided by an iterative process which finds the location of the minimum asymmetry .",
    "the formula for calculating the asymmetry is given by :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the original image pixels , @xmath67 is the image after rotating by 180from each estimated centre .",
    "the background subtraction using light from a blank sky area , called @xmath68 , are critical for this process , and must be minimised in the same way as the original galaxy itself .",
    "a lower value of @xmath69 means that a galaxy has a higher degree of rotational symmetry which tends to be found in elliptical galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "higher values of @xmath69 indicate an asymmetric light distribution , which are usually found in spiral galaxies , or in the more extreme case , merger candidates ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "concentration is a measure of the intensity of light contained within a central region , in comparison to a larger region in the outer - parts of a galaxy .",
    "there are various ways to measure the light concentration in a galaxy , with the most robust and reliable method being taking the ratio of two radii which contain a certain fraction of the galaxy s light ( e.g. , graham et al .",
    "these two light fraction radii should differ enough to ensure that galaxies of different types can be distinguished , but there are limits to how small or large a flux radius should be used .",
    "the reason is that the radius can not be too small or else it will be confused with the psf , and can not be too large as it will be hard to measure the ` total ' light due to sky subtraction errors .",
    "bershady et al . ( 2000 ) investigated several forms for the concentration index , and found that the c@xmath70 index is the most robust for small galaxies , as well as providing the most dynamic range for separating galaxies of different types .",
    "we use this index in this paper .",
    "the exact definition we use to measure light concentration is the ratio of two circular radii which contain 20% and 80% ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) of the total galaxy flux ,    @xmath73    a higher value of @xmath74 indicates that a larger amount of light is contained within a central region .",
    "this particular measurement of the concentration correlates well with the mass and halo properties of galaxies in the nearby universe ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "one major issue we must confront in this paper is the fact that the inner radius of r@xmath54 is likely often smaller than the psf itself , and therefore we are potentially measuring incorrect concentration index values .",
    "we address this issue in detail in  4 .    to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]      the clumpiness ( @xmath75 )",
    "parameter is used to describe the fraction of light in a galaxy which is contained in clumpy light concentrations .",
    "clumpy galaxies have a relatively large amount of light at high spatial frequencies , whereas smooth systems , such as elliptical galaxies contain light at low spatial frequencies .",
    "galaxies which are undergoing star formation tend to have very clumpy structures , and high @xmath75 values .",
    "clumpiness can be measured in a number of ways , the most common method used , as described in conselice ( 2003 ) is ,    @xmath76,\\ ] ]    where , the original image @xmath77 is blurred to produce a secondary image , @xmath78 . this blurred image",
    "is then subtracted from the original image leaving a residual map , containing only high frequency structures in the galaxy ( conselice 2003 ) . to quantify this ,",
    "we normalise the summation of these residuals by the original galaxy s total light , and subtract from this the residual amount of sky after smoothing and subtracting it in the same way .",
    "the size of the smoothing kernel @xmath30 is determined by the radius of the galaxy , and we use @xmath79 ( conselice 2003 ) , although other smoothing scales are possible . note that the centres of galaxies are removed when this procedure is carried out ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "we ultimately do not use the clumpiness index in this paper in any extensive way due to the low dynamic range of values provided by our systems due to their smaller sizes and faintness .",
    "the gini coefficient is a statistical tool originally used to determine the distribution of wealth within a population , with higher values indicating a very unequal distribution ( gini of 1 would mean all wealth / light is in one person / pixel ) , while a lower value indicates it is distributed more evenly amongst the population ( gini of 0 would mean everyone / every pixel has an equal share ) .",
    "the value of g is defined by the lorentz curve of the galaxy s light distribution , which does not take into consideration the spatial positions of pixels .",
    "each pixel is ordered by its brightness and counted as part of the cumulative distribution ( see lotz et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "the 20 parameter is a similar parameter to the concentration in that it gives a value that indicates whether light is concentrated within an image ; it is however calculated slightly differently from c and gini .",
    "the total moment of light is calculated by summing the flux of each pixel multiplied by the square of its distance from the centre .",
    "the centre is the location where 20 is minimised ( lotz et al 2008 ) .",
    "the value of 20 is the moment of the fluxes of the brightest 20% of light in a galaxy , which is then normalised by the total light moment for all pixels ( lotz et al .",
    "2008a ) .    the main differences between 20 and @xmath74 are due to the moments in 20 which depend on the distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "the value of 20 will therefore be more affected by spatial variations , and also the centre of the galaxy is again a free parameter .",
    "this makes it more sensitive to possible mergers .      because many of our sample galaxies are small we must examine the acs point spread function in the udf and compare its profile with the sizes of our galaxies in detail .",
    "the acs psf has been well described in several papers , such as sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and rhodes et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , including studies that carefully analyse acs for use within galaxy lensing studies ( rhodes et al . 2007 ) .",
    "as is well known , the acs psf is affected by optical abberations and geometric distortions , as well as by blurring from charge diffusion from neighboring pixels due to sub - pixel variations .",
    "the psf quality is also affected by the jitter during the observations themselves . due to the large number of images , and careful dither patterns (  2.1 )",
    ", these issues are perhaps better minimised in this field than in any other acs survey .",
    "simulations with tinytim , and observations of stars themselves within deep imaging surveys show that the fwhm of the psf for stars imaged within the wide - field camera of acs is roughly 0.12 after convolving the intrinsic psf width of 0.085 with the detector pixels .",
    "image tests within the udf using stars , find that the fwhm of these stars are on average : 0.084 in the b - band , 0.079 in the v - band , 0.081 in the @xmath2band and 0.089 in the @xmath29band ( beckwith et al .",
    "the scatter on these measurements is roughly 1 - 2 mas , and agree with the expected values after considering the initial convolution from discrete sampling in the 0.05 pixels , and psf smearing from the charge diffusion kernel in adjacent pixels , and convolution by the 0.03 output pixel size ( beckwith et al .",
    "this psf fwhm furthermore does not change significantly between stars in the centre of the udf and those towards the edges .    to determine the effects of the psf on our analysis we first investigate the size distribution of our galaxies in arcsec , as a function of magnitude .",
    "this comparison with the size of the acs psf is shown in figure  6 .",
    "as can be seen , we find that , particularly at faint magnitudes , there are galaxies with half - light radii which are slightly smaller than the non - dithered wfc psf .",
    "these galaxies are all fainter than @xmath80 .",
    "however , nearly all of our galaxies have diameters larger than the non - dithered acs psf . furthermore , only a handful of our galaxies have half - light radii which are smaller than the measured psf in these images ( solid line on figure  6 ) , and very few brighter than our ultimate analysis limit of @xmath81 .",
    "we also show in the bottom panels of figure  6 the relation between the petrosian radius (  3.2 ) and the @xmath29band magnitude .",
    "this demonstrates that all of our galaxies have total radii which are often much larger than the size of the acs psf , both before or after drizzling .",
    "there are a few other ways in which we determine the psf effects on our images and analysis .",
    "the first , as discussed above , is to determine the measured sizes of our galaxies compared to the size of the psf .",
    "the other method is to measure the same parameters using the same code and conditions on stars in our fields , and to determine how these stars , which are effectively giving us a measure of the diversity in how the point spread function is sampled , behave in the various diagnostic methods we utilise . since the udf has a limited field of view , and was designed to avoid stars , we utilise stars found within the cosmos field ( see paper iii ; conselice et al . 2009 ) for later comparisons when discussing this aspect .",
    "as this is the first major study to investigate in detail the morphological and structural properties of @xmath5 galaxies , it is important to understand the sources of error and biases that are present when we examine distant galaxies . these include effects from redshifts , both due to decreased signal to noise and resolution , but also importantly , we must understand and account for effects from the point spread function from acs , as many galaxies have half - light radii similar to , or just slightly larger than the fwhm of the psf (  3.3 )    as mentioned earlier , there are a few other major problems that must be dealt with when examining galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "these include : cosmological surface brightness dimming , and morphological @xmath82corrections , as well as resolution vs. galaxy size . since higher redshift galaxies are smaller on average than those at lower redshifts ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ; trujillo et al . 2007 ;",
    "buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ) it is possible that even within the acs udf image we are not imaging deep enough to see the full structures of our @xmath5 galaxies .",
    "the long exposure times of the udf , and the use of acs , alleviates some of these issues , which we explore in depth .",
    "there are several ways in which we determine the systematic and random errors on our quantitative parameter measurements .",
    "one way is by simulating lower redshift galaxies to higher redshifts to determine how different parameters change purely due to redshift effects .",
    "this method was pioneered in conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and conselice ( 2003 ) , and remains an effective way to account for the effects of redshift .",
    "another method to determine our likely error distribution is to use the data themselves to determine the likely systematics and how they are distributed , and whether they are accounted for by our measured errors .",
    "an important method for determining any systematic biases when comparing galaxies at various redshifts is to quantify how measures of galaxy size and structure change when a nearby galaxy is placed at larger distances .",
    "the measurement of galaxy sizes and structure will change as the same galaxy becomes more distant , for example in a simulation , due to decreased resolution and more noise due to a lower measured flux . for distant galaxies at @xmath83 , where the angular size distance does not change much in our cosmology , resolution for a galaxy of a given size and brightness",
    "is not important beyond the fact that it produces a lower surface brightness .",
    "however , if galaxy sizes decrease with time , as lbgs are thought to do ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) , then resolution can have an important effect on the measured sizes and structural parameters .",
    "the effects of distance on structural parameters , such as cas , have been discussed in detail , and are well calibrated in previous papers for galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "the typical way to carry out these types of analyses is to take galaxies at @xmath84 ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003b ) or @xmath85 ( conselice et al . 2005 ) and simulate the same galaxies to how they would appear at higher redshifts within our observational conditions and parameters ( i.e. , udf exposure time , hst aperture , acs psf , etc . ) , sans any morphological k - correction .",
    "one problem with this approach is that it assumes that the galaxy which is being simulated is intrinsically similar , or that the size and structure behave in a similar way , to the higher redshift galaxy population which is being studied .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that the galaxies we see at @xmath5 are similar to galaxies at @xmath52 due to the structure - redshift relation ( conselice et al .",
    "2005 ) , as well as due to differing stellar populations ( e.g. , yan et al . 2005 ; stark et al . 2007 ; eyles et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "nevertheless , these simulations can provide a powerful tool for understanding the limits in which we can measure structures and sizes .",
    "the general reason is that these parameters are fairly simple , and use the galaxy profile and the amount of ` clumpy ' light in a galaxy for measurements .",
    "the factor which can differ is the absolute size of the profile , and the distribution of ` clumpy ' features , and how large these are relative to the galaxies themselves .",
    "we addresses these issues later in  4.2 .",
    "however , we discuss in this section the results of a series of different simulations to determine the ability to measure galaxy structure in such faint and small galaxies as within our sample",
    ".      the nearby galaxy simulations we discuss are included in the analysis of previous papers , including conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and conselice ( 2003 ) .",
    "these simulations consist of taking nearby , mostly normal , galaxies such as spirals and ellipticals with some peculiars and irregulars , and rebinning their pixels , and in some cases adding sky noise , to simulate further distances .",
    "the sizes and structures of these galaxies are then measured the same way they were before they were simulated to determine how effects of resolution , increased noise ( lower s / n ) , and higher redshifts , can affect the measured values .    using a sample of 113 nearby bright galaxies , conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) determine the resolution limit for which galaxies can have their asymmetry indices properly measured .",
    "this was done by degrading the resolution of these 113 galaxies , and then re - measuring the asymmetry index , and comparing this to the original values .",
    "these simulations and re - measurements demonstrate that if 0.5 h@xmath86 kpc is resolved ( or 0.54 kpc in our cosmology ) , then the asymmetry index can be measured within 10% . furthermore , as figure  20 of conselice",
    "( 2000a ) demonstrates , 0.7 - 0.9 kpc of structure must be resolved to utilize this index .",
    "we are imaging our galaxies at this limit .",
    "however , we note that these simulations are done for galaxies which are intrinsically larger than the distant galaxies we are examining in the udf ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2004 ; ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in a similar vain , bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) simulated 72 nearby galaxies , mostly spirals and ellipticals , to determine at what limit the concentration index can be utilised .",
    "these simulations are similar to those from conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) in that these galaxies were re - binned in their pixels to create smaller sized systems , and their results are measured in terms of the effective radius in pixel units .",
    "bershady et al . (",
    "2000 ) further investigated which type of concentration index is the most stable to these types of effects , and therefore the most useful for use at high redshifts , concluding , as explained in  3.2.3 that the index we use here is the most robust while still providing a broad dynamic range to cover different galaxy types .",
    "however , when galaxies become very small compared to the psf size , it becomes more difficult to measure an accurate r@xmath54 radius from which the concentration index is measured .",
    "bershady et al.s simulations reduce the half - light radii of galaxies to 0.3 - 0.7 , similar to the largest galaxies within our sample .",
    "bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that the half - light radii is extremely stable , and can be measured accurately , even when sampling just a few pixels .",
    "furthermore , for galaxies which have radii measured with 7 pixels , the mean differences in concentration , relative to the original image , are : @xmath87 = -0.1@xmath88 , increasing to @xmath89 when five pixels are used to sample the half - light radius , which is only 8% of the dynamic range given by our particular choice of concentration index (  3.2.3 ) .",
    "about half of our sample have effective radii smaller than 4 pixels , where the bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) simulations suggest that the measured scatter increases significantly . however , we later find that these smallest drop - outs display a correlation between half - light radii and concentration (  5.4 ) , suggesting that concentration can be measured even within this potential scatter",
    ".    the bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) simulations are particularly useful for our purposes as they examine how the concentration index changes as a function of half - light radii , thus we can directly compare their results with our galaxies .",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) carry out similar simulations using eight galaxies of classes : s0 , e , sab , sbc , sc , sd , and two mergers ( the antennae and arp 220 ) .",
    "they conclude , similar to the findings of conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and bershady et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that the concentration , gini , and m@xmath54 indices are reliable to 10% down to a ( s / n ) per pixel of @xmath90 .",
    "they furthermore show that concentration and m@xmath54 can be retrieved to within 15% down to resolutions of 500 pc , or better and down to 1000 pc for the asymmetry , gini and clumpiness indices . for the reasons above , and due to limits on measuring structures at small sizes , we place a restriction of s / n @xmath91 and mag @xmath92 on galaxies to be included in later structural analyses in this paper ( figure  2 ) .",
    "these results all suggest that we are just at the limit , for our smallest and faintest galaxies , with the resolving power of acs and within our s / n and magnitude limit , to determine accurate parameters for our galaxies , within a well defined uncertainty .",
    "the above simulations were however all done using nearby normal galaxies , which are certainly different from our current @xmath5 sample , most particularly within their measured sizes .",
    "as such , we carry out new simulations using drop - outs themselves , placing b - drops and v - drops to respective higher redshifts , and measuring how the structure and sizes of these galaxies change when view in the redder acs filters within the udf .",
    "the general method for carrying this out is explained in detail in conselice ( 2003 ) .",

    "these differences ( @xmath59 ) are such that @xmath93 , that is the difference between the original images and the simulated ones .",
    "the values quoted here are the average differences for the entire simulated sample .",
    "show are the values for the cas parameters , and the total petrosian radius . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can get some sense of the structural properties of our sample of drop - outs by examining the relationship between the concentration index ( @xmath74 ) and the moment ratio parameter , m@xmath54 . both of these parameters measure how much light is concentrated in galaxies .",
    "the @xmath74 parameter differs from m@xmath54 in that the @xmath74 parameters measures the concentration with regards to the centre of a galaxy , and m@xmath54 gives more spatial information on where light is distributed , and is more sensitive to outer light than the concentration .",
    "a galaxy with a high @xmath74 value , e.g. , @xmath94 , should have a low m@xmath54 index with values @xmath95 .",
    "in general , we find that galaxies with a high @xmath74 index are normal , without visual evidence for peculiarities ( e.g. , figure  11 ) , and these galaxies also have the lowest @xmath96 values .",
    "if we extend the rough correlation between @xmath74 and m@xmath54 for the high @xmath74 objects , we do not find objects which have the same ( low ) m@xmath54 values per given value of the concentration index .",
    "indeed , what we find is that the values of m@xmath54 get larger per concentration value , at lower concentrations .",
    "what this means is that for non - concentrated galaxies , the distribution and brightness of the brightest 20% of pixels grows larger at a lower concentration .",
    "this is one indication that these systems are not in a relaxed state .",
    "in fact , the galaxies which deviate most in m@xmath54 are the galaxies that are visually identified as merging systems , but not uniquely so ( figure  11 ) .",
    "we derive the unusual or non - symmetric fraction of galaxies within our sample in three different ways .",
    "this includes investigating how many peculiar galaxies , as measured by eye , we have in our sample at each redshift , how many galaxies are quantitatively asymmetric and have uneven light distributions suggestive of mergers / assembly , as well as a new technique to find pairs using the lyman - break methodology to determine whether two galaxies projected on the sky are potentially merging . each of these methods has systematic errors which we address quantitatively .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward method for determining the merger fraction for these lyman - break drop - out galaxies at @xmath5 is to determine how the fraction of distorted and peculiar galaxies changes with redshift .",
    "first we examine the fraction of drop - outs which appear visually peculiar .",
    "we show this evolution in figure  10 ( as crosses ) , where we find that the fraction of galaxies in our drop - out sample , with mag @xmath92 and s / n @xmath48 , which have a peculiar structure , possibly indicative of mergers or recently assembly , ranges from 0.28@xmath600.05 for the b - drops to 0.52@xmath600.09 for the v - drops , and 0.55@xmath600.23 for the @xmath2drops .",
    "what is perhaps surprising about these numbers is that roughly half of all the drop - outs appear to be symmetrical and round systems that are unlikely to have gone through a recent dynamical assembly episode .    to 80 mm        [ sample - figure ]    to 80 mm        [ sample - figure ]",
    "we can also see this diversity in the structures of our drop - out samples by investigating where they fall in structural diagrams .",
    "first , as already discussed , figure  11 shows that galaxies which are chosen by eye as peculiar have a high m@xmath54 index at lower concentrations , an indication that systems that appear as peculiar have a significant fraction of their light in their outer parts , rather than concentrated towards the centre .",
    "similar trends can be seen when we examine the asymmetry index with the m@xmath54 index ( figure  12 ) .",
    "the m@xmath54 index has been used previously as a sole indicator for finding mergers in rest - frame uv imaging ( e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "2006 ) , such that systems which have a high m@xmath54 index are more likely to be systems undergoing some form of assembly or merging .",
    "figure  12 shows that for the b - drops and the v - drops there is a rough relation between asymmetry and m@xmath54 , such that galaxies which are more asymmetric have higher m@xmath54 values .",
    "we also find that those systems which appear visually as peculiar ( labeled as triangles ) are more likely than non - peculiar and smooth systems (  3.1 ; small dots ) to have a high asymmetry and/or a low m@xmath54 value .",
    "in fact the only systems with low - asymmetry and low m@xmath54 values are the smooth normally appearing galaxies .",
    "this is a verification that our methods for identifying structurally smooth galaxies with the cas and m@xmath54 parameters works .",
    "figure  13 shows the location of our sample within concentration - asymmetry diagrams .",
    "similar to figure  12 , we find a mixture of structures , as measured quantitatively , for our sample , with a range of light concentrations and asymmetry distributions .",
    "we also label on figure  13 the location of nearby galaxy types .",
    "although we are not arguing that these drop - outs are similar in anyway to nearby galaxies , it does show that the measured cas values span the range of the values found for nearby galaxies .",
    "we use the simple merger fraction criteria from the cas method of @xmath53 to calculate the merger fractions for our drop - out samples .",
    "note that the cas values we plot on figures  11 - 13 are the observed values , and we must use the corrected cas values for k - corrections and redshift (  4.4 ) to measure a merger fraction in a comparable way to the measures at lower redshifts ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "what we find is that the inferred merger fractions using these rest - frame optical and calibrated asymmetries values are : 0.23@xmath600.05 ( b - drops ) , 0.19@xmath600.05 ( v - drops ) and 0.19@xmath600.13 ( i - drops ) .",
    "one aspect that figures  12 - 13 shows is that there are some galaxies which are identified as a merger by visual estimates , but which do not have very high asymmetries .",
    "this is a well known effect , and has been documented and discussed in conselice ( 2003a ) , conselice et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; lotz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and other papers . for nearby ongoing major mergers , such as ulirgs ,",
    "only roughly half of these systems have a large asymmetry , such that @xmath53 ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that within the merger process , which can last for over a gyr , only during a fraction of this time will the merger be identified as having a high asymmetry ( e.g. , conselice 2006 ) .",
    "n - body models show that the time for a galaxy to have a high asymmetry is roughly a factor of 2 - 3 times shorter than the entire merger process ( conselice 2006 ; lotz et al .",
    "2008b ) . during other times",
    ", the merging galaxy will fall into non - merger regions of the cas space .",
    "we can however test the likelihood , based on simple arguments , that these two determinations are measuring part of the same population . as figure  13 shows ,",
    "only a fraction of the systems with @xmath53 , or at least galaxies with a high asymmetry , are found to have a structure which is classified as a peculiar or merger through our visual estimates .",
    "this is also reflected in the higher fraction of galaxies which look peculiar compared with those that are highly asymmetric ( figure  10 ) .",
    "we can use the fact that some of our galaxies are peculiar , and the assumption that these structures are produced through either mergers or some type of assembly , to calculate the likely dynamical time - scales for these galaxies .",
    "if we take as our hypothesis that these distorted structures are tracing changes in the underlying potential due to a merger , then we calculate through basic arguments the amount of time the galaxy will appear distorted given its size and internal velocities .    a very important question within this analysis is how long a galaxy which has recently undergone a merger will appear distorted . the dynamical time ( @xmath97 ) , or crossing time , of a galaxy can be written as , @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the radius of the galaxy , m@xmath100 is the total mass , and @xmath30 is the internal velocity dispersion .",
    "this equation was used previously by e.g. , hathi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to measure the time a symmetrical galaxy must be dynamically quiescent . for our systems , we obtain dynamical time - scales of @xmath101 years . however , this time - scale is unlikely to represent the time for a galaxy to become relaxed and produce a normal and smooth galaxy profile . more generally , we are interested in how long a galaxy appears morphological peculiar after a merger event",
    ". we can use the two - body relaxation time expanded to larger systems , in our case a galaxy .",
    "however , the two - body relaxation time is very long , as the crossing times of a galaxy are too long for star - star encounters to produce effective relaxation .",
    "as described in lynden - bell ( 1967 ) , the time - scale for a merging galaxy to become relaxed is determined by the rapidly changing potential energy within the evolving system .",
    "this ` violent relaxation ' is a complex process which is difficult to characterise through an analytical approximation , and the best way to approach measuring morphological time - scales is through n - body simulations of the merger process ( e.g. , mihos 1995 ; conselice 2006 ; lotz et al .",
    "mihos ( 1995 ) attempted to determined the amount of time that two disk galaxies would be visible as merging systems when observed with the hubble space telescope s wide field camera-2 at @xmath85 and @xmath102 within a 10@xmath103 second exposure ( note that the udf exposures at about 100 times this ) using the f785lp filter .",
    "mihos ( 1995 ) conclude that merger features can be seen for around 350 myr at @xmath102 , but for a shorter period of time at @xmath85 .",
    "however , these simulations were done using the less efficient and lower resolution wfpc2 camera , and using a shorter exposure times than our acs images .",
    "the question of how long a merger can be identified through cas and visually was addressed in conselice ( 2006 ) , and lotz et al .",
    "( 2008b ) who both found that the visual mergers last for on order 1 gyr , and that the cas method would find mergers for 0.5 gyr .",
    "based on the cas method we can conclude that the time - scale for peculiars to have formed from mergers would be @xmath104 0.5 gyr in the past , as they are asymmetric .",
    "likewise , observational conditions assumed in mihos ( 1995 ) s simulations for @xmath102 are similar to the conditions ( e.g. , s / n per total observation ) for galaxies observed at @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the visual estimates for finding a merger for our systems are no shorter than 0.4 - 0.5 gyr .",
    "this time - scale tells us not only how long a galaxy would be seen as asymmetric , but also reveals , for a smooth system , the minimum amount of time since the last major merger or assembly episode .",
    "we also know from simulations that the cas method will only pick out a merger within a given amount of time , roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the entire merger process ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "if this is the case then we would expect the ratio of the visual merger fraction ( f@xmath106 ) to the ratio of the cas merger fraction ( f@xmath107 ) to be between 2 - 3 .",
    "we calculate ratios of 1.2 , 2.7 and 2.9 , in rough agreement with expected values , if asymmetries and peculiar structures are tracing a larger potential .",
    "it is important to note that the galaxies we examine are likely dominated throughout their structures by star formation , and therefore the uv images of these systems reveals their structure , unlike at lower redshifts where galaxies contain a mixture of young and more evolved stellar populations ( e.g. , windhorst et al .",

    "it has often been commented on in the high@xmath41 galaxy literature that drop - outs seen in the goods and the udf fields are found in pairs - that is two drop - outs appear to be near each other in the sky . unlike the case for general field galaxy populations , it is relatively straightforward to determine whether two galaxies , which are drop - outs , are likely true physical pairs as opposed to simply chance superpositions due to the nature of the lyman - break .",
    "example of these lyman - break galaxies in pairs are shown in figure  3 .",
    "we measure the lyman - break galaxy pair fraction by utilising the feature of the lyman - break , which limits the range on the redshifts of galaxies , to isolate galaxies at similar narrow redshifts ranges .",
    "this allows us to determine , with a high certainty , the merger fraction for these systems , as it automatically removes galaxies at very different lower and higher redshifts .",
    "while there is still a probability that these galaxies are chance superpositions within the break redshift range , in practice , the surface density is low enough that this correction is fairly minor .",
    "we define a galaxy lyman - break pair by those which are separated by 20 h@xmath21 kpc , or less .",
    "we do not use a magnitude limit to select our pairs .",
    "we do this so as to not bias the measured values due to unknown k - corrections for these galaxies , which are often not resolved into separate systems within _ spitzer _ imaging .",
    "therefore our values are not proper measured merger fractions within the normal 1.5 b - mag range .",
    "we define the number of galaxies which are within our separation using each of our lyman - break selections as n@xmath108 , and the merger fraction is thus ,    @xmath109    where cor is a correction for the background given by the ratio of the average number of galaxies found within an aperture of 20 h@xmath21 kpc in radius , but placed randomly throughout the udf image .",
    "we also take into account the fact that some galaxies near the edges of the frame can not have a properly measured pair fraction due to the limited survey area ( e.g. , patton et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we make a correction for the limited total area of the survey by considering the ratio of the area in which a pair is identified ( @xmath110 ) , and the total area covered in the survey ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "considering the situation where the observed pair fraction ( @xmath112 ) is known , then the true pair fraction ( @xmath113 ) is given by :    @xmath114    after correcting for the edge of the field , we find that the pair fraction for the b - drops , v - drops and @xmath61-drops are : 0.21@xmath600.03 , 0.19@xmath600.04 and 0.16@xmath600.05 , respectively .",
    "these values are all within 1 @xmath30 of the cas values , therefore two independent methodologies are able to retrieve the same value for the merger history at @xmath0",
    ". examples of these physical pairs , where both galaxies are a lyman - break drop - out at the same redshift , are shown in figure  3 .",
    "note that if a galaxy is in a pair , we do not rule out that it can also be counted as a merger based on its structural parameters .",
    "we use the results of the previous sections , that is the peculiar galaxy fraction (  5.1 ) and the incidence of galaxies in pairs (  5.2 ) to determine the assembly and possible merger state of lbgs at @xmath5 .",

    "we can use these merger fraction estimates to calculate the merger fraction evolution for our systems by comparing directly to the merger fraction measurements at @xmath16 taken from paper i.    since we have previously measured our merger fractions as a function of stellar mass , we need to have some understanding of the stellar masses for our @xmath5 galaxies .",

    "first , because of the distances to these galaxies , and the unknown state of their gas and structure , we can not make any firm conclusions regarding their merger state .",
    "we can infer the that structural parameters are measuring some type of assembly , but whether this is major mergers , minor mergers , or some type of gas accretion event is unknowable within our data .",
    "although high asymmetries are thought to signify major mergers at at least @xmath16 , this may not be the case at @xmath5 where conditions are quite different .",
    "therefore , what we claim to be a measured merger fraction or evolution can be interpreted as some type of assembly event that has not cooled dynamically .    however , the fact that the cas method for finding mergers is within @xmath126 of the galaxy pair fraction , similar to the situation at @xmath51 ( de propris et al .",
    "2007 ) , is a strong indication that we are potentially probing correctly the merger fraction through both methods .",
    "this is also reinforced by the roughly factor of two higher fraction of distorted galaxies than systems which are asymmetric , again similar to galaxies at @xmath16 ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2005 ; conselice et al .",
    "with this caveat we are now able to trace what is the inferred evolution of this assembly .    the traditional method for parameterising the evolution of the merger fraction is to use a power - law fitting formula of the form :    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the merger fraction at a given redshift , @xmath129 is the merger fraction at @xmath84 , and @xmath130 is the power - law index for quantifying the merger fraction evolution .",

    "however , these forms do not completely fit the merger history at @xmath136 , and in fact , there is no simple way to parameterise the currently known merger fraction at @xmath136 selected at a constant stellar mass .",

    "we find however , that @xmath140 give almost as good of a fit , as @xmath139 .",
    "one possible reason why no simple parameterisation is well fit by the data is that the galaxies that make up the merger fraction at the highest redshifts evolve to become more massive than the comparison sample at lower redshifts . because we are using a constant stellar mass limit for determining the merger fraction",
    ", we are comparing galaxies with stellar masses m@xmath6 at all redshifts .",
    "however the galaxies at @xmath5 we examine are possibly , due to future mergers and star formation , to be among the most massive at lower redshifts , such that a better comparison is possible when using a higher stellar mass limit at the lower redshifts .",
    "ideally we want to trace the same galaxies and how their merger histories evolve through time .",
    "when better data becomes available it will be possible to measure these parameters more accurately , and eventually trace the same galaxies through time based on their star formation and merger histories .",

    "to 90 mm        [ sample - figure ]      this relation between the concentration and half - light radius , which is generally seen for early - type galaxies at @xmath52 , is such that some of our galaxies have measured half - light radii sizes which are similar to the fwhm of the acs psf as shown in figure  17 by the upper horizontal line .",
    "as described in  3.2.1 , 3.3 and 4.1 , this resolution is sufficient to measure the sizes of these systems , as well as their concentration values for most galaxies .",
    "this is further borne out by the consistency of the measured concentration index as measured after simulating drop - out galaxies to higher redshifts (  4.1 ) .",
    "another way to address this issue is to determine how the stars seen within the cosmos field (  3.3 ) fall within the concentration vs. half - light relation .",
    "as we have already seen , the concentration values for these stars are all at @xmath174 . as a further test , in figure  18 we plot the concentration vs. half - light radii for our faint galaxy and star sample from the cosmos field , with the assumption that they are all at @xmath105 , and thus mimicking our v - drop sample .",
    "figure  18 demonstrates that the stars within the cosmos sample all fall into four different areas of the concentration vs. size plane .",
    "we note that none of the galaxies we study have concentration values as low as these stars , and this is further evidence that the psf is not dominating the measured concentrations .",
    "furthermore , we find that all of the half - light diameter measurements are either just at , or larger than , the size of the drizzled acs psf ( comparable with the lower dashed line ) .",
    "it however remains possible that some of our systems have sizes smaller than their measured values , and our measurements are upper limits for galaxies at @xmath175 .",

    "we can furthermore demonstrate , using the ratio of different radii , that there is a relationship between light concentration and size , and that this is not due to effects from the psf .",

    "there is a slight tendency for this ratio of radii to approach smaller values at fainter magnitudes , but this occurs below our @xmath81 magnitude cut .",
    "the meaning of the correlation between concentration and size is likely related to the fact that for nearby elliptical galaxies , the concentration index correlates with the stellar mass ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "this relation is such that galaxies with a larger concentration index have a larger mass .",
    "several examples of these smooth galaxies are shown in figure  16 .",

    "it contains a concentration index of @xmath180 , which places it at the upper end of our c vs. half - light relation .",
    "we argue that the correlation between the sizes of these lyman - break galaxies and their light concentrations suggests that these galaxies are at least temporarily relaxed systems that have either formed rapidly in a single burst , or have had a merger some time ago .",
    "they are also the only systems besides ellipticals at @xmath52 which show a correlation between size and concentration , suggesting that the formation modes for these systems may be similar to those of ellipticals . however , the sizes of these systems , at a given concentration , are smaller by a factor of @xmath90 compared with @xmath52 systems ( e.g. , buitrago et al .",
    "this difference is either due to an intrinsic growth after multiple mergers ( e.g. , trujillo et al .",

    "it appears therefore that these systems are in , at least , a temporarily relaxed state . by using the results of section 5.1.2",

    "if we are able to see merger signature for 1 gyr , then we could rule out any merging activity occurring for at least the smooth @xmath2drop sample .",
    "this implies that at least some of these systems were not formed by a major merger process , but have had an assembly produced through a rapid collapse of gas , or a rapid assembly through the accretion of gas ( e.g. , keres et al .",

    "this later effect may not be a major issue , as by definition our lbgs are uv bright , and thus can not be dust dominated as shown by adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) .    with these caveats ,",
    "we determine the relationship between the star formation rate of our galaxies and their structural features .",
    "previous similar studies at lower redshifts have found little or no correlation between structural features , as measured in the ultraviolet , and the star formation rate or other physical features ( e.g. , law et al . 2007 ; peter et al .",
    ". however , by using optical morphologies there are correlations between the structures of galaxies and the underlying physical properties ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "the rest - frame uv cas parameters have also never been examined in terms of the measured star formation rate . in general , the only parameter that strongly correlates with star formation in the nearby universe is the clumpiness index , @xmath75 .    to 160 mm        [ sample - figure ]    with a few important exceptions , we find that within our sample there is very little to no correlation between structural parameters and star formation rates as measured by equation ( 17 ) .",
    "we plot these correlations on figure  20 , which shows how star formation relates to the concentration index , the asymmetry index , the m@xmath54 values , and the half - light radii ( r@xmath184 ) , with the unextincted star formation rate .",
    "there are a few slight correlations which can be seen .",
    "one correlation is that for some drop - outs , there is a slightly higher star formation rate for those which appear distorted or peculiar .",
    "we find that within the @xmath61-drops the star formation rate for the galaxies classified as peculiars is @xmath185 = 27@xmath186 year@xmath21 , while the @xmath2drops classified as normal have a star formation rate of @xmath185 = 28@xmath187 year@xmath21 . the star formation rate for the @xmath2drops thus does not appear to depend on the apparent visual morphology of the system . at lower redshifts",
    ", there is a larger difference , with the distorted galaxies revealing a higher star formation rate .",
    "the v - drops which are peculiar have a star formation rate of @xmath185 = 63@xmath188 year@xmath21 , with the average dominated by a few very highly star forming systems .",
    "the normal v - drops have a star formation rate of @xmath185 = 28.0@xmath187 year@xmath21 .",
    "likewise for the lowest redshifts systems in our sample , the b - drops , the star formation rate for the peculiar systems is @xmath185 = 49@xmath189 year@xmath21 , while for the normal galaxies it is @xmath190 24@xmath191 year@xmath21 .",
    "another correlation is that , on average , systems which are more concentrated , as measured by both the concentration and m@xmath54 indices , have a higher degree of star formation .",
    "this probability is such that by using a generalised kendall s tau there is a @xmath62 0.04 probability that a correlation is not present between star formation and concentration and m@xmath54 .",
    "there is also a similar correlation between the size of these galaxies and their star formation rates .",
    "this correlation is partially due to larger galaxies having more area for star formation as this correlation , as well as the others with size , is largely removed after comparing the star formation rate density , that is the star formation rate per unit area , with the same parameters .",
    "we do not see any correlation between star formation rate and the asymmetry parameter , which suggests that in the different phases of formation , the star formation rate remains similar .",
    "however , the more concentrated , and likely more massive , systems contain a higher star formation rate then less concentrated galaxies reflecting the likely rapid assembly of these systems .",
    "the major result from this paper is that the structures of the earliest galaxies , as probed in ultraviolet light , are diverse .",
    "this can be seen by examining the images of these systems within the hubble ultra deep field ( e.g. , figure  3 - 4 & 16 ) at @xmath159 .",
    "not surprisingly , we do not find the same kinds of galaxies at lower redshifts , even at @xmath192 ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in particular we see no spiral - type systems , or any obvious disk galaxies , even in formation , although systems like this are seen at @xmath193 ( conselice et al .",
    "we do however find that a significant fraction of galaxies at @xmath5 are peculiar and distorted , although over half of these systems are smooth and symmetrical .",
    "we argue below that this diversity in appearance is the result of galaxy formation processes , and are not arbitrary .",
    "we furthermore make the case that the galaxies which appear smooth and symmetrical are likely to be in a relaxed phase , while those which are asymmetrical are in an active phase of assembly , possibly due to recent merging activity .",
    "we furthermore make the case that we are witnessing the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and we are able to put constraints on what fraction of the first massive galaxies were perhaps formed through a very rapid collapse of gas , as opposed to being formed from mergers of lower mass galaxies at even earlier times .",
    "the question we address in this section is what type of formation modes the asymmetrical , distorted galaxies in our sample are undergoing , and whether they are fundamentally different from the smooth and symmetrical systems .",
    "in particular , we want to understand if the smooth and asymmetrical galaxies are related to each other . the data and plots presented in this paper",
    "allow us to directly address this question .",
    "first , there are two important observations which suggest that the distorted and asymmetric galaxies are undergoing an assembly phase , perhaps driven by mergers .",
    "the first question we need to address is whether or not the third of the lbgs we see in the udf which are asymmetric are ongoing mergers of some type .",
    "they are certainly in an active phase of evolution due to their high star formation rates (  5.5 ) , and due to the fact that between 20 - 40% of the galaxies we examine are peculiar in structure , or have a large enough asymmetry to be considered a merger within the cas system ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "2008 ) . without kinematic measures for these systems , which are likely at least a decade away",
    "if not longer , we can not confirm with 100% certainty that any one of these systems are mergers .",
    "although , even with resolved spectroscopy , determining if galaxies are mergers is ambiguous ( e.g. , law et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "however , what is clear is that these galaxies are in an assembly phase , and are hosting ongoing star formation .",
    "what is also clear , especially from nicmos observations of slightly lower redshift lyman - break galaxies ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2005 ) is that the asymmetric features in these galaxies are not produced by small - scale features , such as star forming knots , but are bulk structures .",
    "these bulk asymmetric structures do not have to be the result of the merging process , but they are due to an assembly process , perhaps cold gas accretion or minor mergers .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sizes of asymmetric galaxies are significantly larger than smooth symmetrical galaxies (  5.4 ) .",
    "this is expected if the asymmetric galaxies are forming by the merging of two or more galaxies .    despite this",
    ", we can make the case that a significant fraction of the lyman - break galaxies are indeed within a major merger phase .",
    "the reason for this is that roughly 20% of the drop - out galaxies within our sample are found within a galaxy pair .",
    "this is just smaller than the galaxy merger fraction for our systems from cas which are roughly f@xmath194 (  5.2 ) .",
    "this ratio of pair to structural fractions is roughly what is expected based on n - body simulations ( e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "2008b ) , and is similar to what is seen for @xmath52 merging galaxies ( e.g. , paper iii ) . in summary , it is therefore inescapable that 20% of our systems at @xmath195 are involved in some type of merger .",
    "overall , we find that on average , a massive galaxy with m@xmath120 will undergo 2.5 to 7 mergers at @xmath196 , depending on the time - scale for finding mergers within the cas method ( e.g. , conselice 2006 ; lotz et al .",
    "2008b ) , but hardly any of this merging occurs at @xmath5 .",
    "this merger history does not vary significantly within @xmath197 , and remains flat for both the pair and the structurally derived mergers ( figure  10 ) .",
    "furthermore , we show in figure  15 , and discuss in  5.3.3 , that these lbgs only undergo on average half a merger between @xmath4 and @xmath3 . however , this is based on a merger time - scale of @xmath154 gyr , although it is possible that multiple mergers are ongoing through this time - period .",
    "if indeed these galaxies are merging within our best estimate of the merger time - scale , then merging is not the dominant method for adding mass to galaxies between @xmath3 and 6 , and in fact the mergers we see within the @xmath3 lbg population could have started at @xmath4 or earlier .",
    "furthermore , smooth gas accretion could significantly add gas and stellar mass to these galaxies ( e.g. , keres et al . 2005 ) .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable result from this paper is the fact that more than half of our galaxy sample appear to be smooth relaxed systems , even within their rest - frame ultraviolet structure (  5.4 ) .",
    "we have presented evidence that a significant fraction of our sample of lbgs within the hubble udf are smooth and possibly relaxed systems .",
    "perhaps the major evidence is the fact that these smooth systems , as defined by the asymmetry and m@xmath54 indices , show a significant correlation between their measured half - light radii and the concentration of light .",
    "this correlation is such that galaxies with higher concentration indices have larger sizes .",
    "there is no correlation ( at @xmath198 @xmath30 confidence ) between the concentration and size for galaxies which are asymmetric , or show multiple components in their structure (  5.4 ) .",
    "this is strong evidence that these two types of galaxies are from different populations .",
    "we have further argued that this relation is not an artifact of our smaller galaxies having half - light radii similar to the size of the acs psf .",
    "we conclude that the systems which display a tight correlation between size and concentration are those that are , at least temporarily , in a relaxed state , while those which are distorted and asymmetric are currently undergoing a dynamically assembly phase or merger .",
    "this implies that the smooth galaxies have not undergone a significant dynamical event some time in the recent past .",
    "we further calculate , based on the likely internal velocities for these galaxies , what the time - scale is for these smooth and symmetrical systems to have been relaxed .",
    "we find that this time - scale , based on lbg sizes and likely masses , is roughly 0.5 gyr .",
    "this is similar to the separation in time between mergers at @xmath193 , which we calculate with the @xmath144 index , described in  5.3.3 .",
    "these two methods give similar results - that is the time - scale between two successive mergers , and the time for relaxation are similar , suggesting that there is enough time between successive merging events for these systems to become relaxed enough to appear smooth and symmetric at lower redshifts .",
    "the time scales for relaxation are older than , or similar to , the age of the universe at @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that most if not all of the smooth galaxies we examine were likely formed very early , or within a mode where star formation can occur in - situ within a small area or region over a short time period , such as cold gas accretion ( e.g. , keres et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we however can not rule out that an assembly event occurred for these galaxies at @xmath9 , due to the difficulty of finding merger signatures after 0.5 gyr .",
    "thus , to solidly determine initial galaxy formation will require observations of @xmath9 galaxies . because these galaxies are resolved , it is unlikely that any bulk large - scale features will be seen when these galaxies are imaged at higher resolution .",
    "this implies that these galaxies might be primordial in the sense that they were not formed by the mergers of two pre - existing galaxies .",
    "it is possible that these systems , which dominate our lbg population at @xmath19 are forming through the gradual smooth accretion of intergalactic gas , as proposed by e.g. , keres et al .",
    "if they were produced through a merger , we would still see residuals from this process in a distorted structure .",
    "therefore we conclude that many lbgs galaxies , with stellar masses up to m@xmath199 , are not being formed by mergers at @xmath5 , but are formed in a type of initial very rapid smooth formation at @xmath9 . however , as we argued in this paper , and in previous work cited throughout , the merger process is important for building up the mass of massive galaxies down to @xmath85 , and is most important during @xmath200 ( e.g. , paper i ; bluck et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the question we would like to address is how to fit these results into a framework or model for how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "while we now have a picture observationally for how galaxies form , we would ideally like to understand these observations in terms of the physics of galaxy formation , especially within a cosmological context .",
    "there are currently very few models for how the stars in galaxies are distributed at high redshift .",
    "predicting structures , asymmetries , concentrations , and even the sizes of these galaxies is very difficult , and has not yet been done to any satisfying degree , and certainly not at the level in which we can compare our results with .",
    "we can , however , conclude that what we are likely witnessing is a formation mode which repeats itself every few gyr within galaxies .",
    "the fact that there are so many smooth , and apparently dynamically relaxed systems , suggests this is the case .",
    "this is also borne out by the time - scales for merging based on the @xmath144 factor which traces the time between when a galaxy will undergo a merger .",
    "what we are perhaps witnessing at @xmath201 is the early formation modes of the hubble sequence where galaxies alternate between dynamical assembly and/or mergers and dynamically quiescent systems .",
    "it is not clear if all of the smooth systems will eventually merge again , or passively evolve , but it seems likely that many of them will , given that at @xmath5 an average lbg in our sample will undergo a major merger every 2 gyr .",
    "this structure formation for galaxies appear to continue down to lower redshifts until @xmath52 when disk galaxies become more common ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2005 ; 2008 ) .",
    "these observations are consistent with the idea that merging is an important process for the formation of galaxies in the early universe up until when the universe was roughly half its current age .",
    "we present in this paper the first systematic study of the structures of galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "we find a diversity in galaxy structure as seen in the observed acs @xmath29band imaging of these systems .",
    "we find that there are significant correlations between the structures of these galaxies and other physical properties that suggest how these systems are forming .",
    "one caveat about our results is that we are studying these galaxies in the rest - frame uv using observed optical light from acs on the hubble space telescope .",
    "we find that roughly half of all the lbgs in our sample are distorted , or measured to have large asymmetries , but that the remainder are smooth , and apparently dynamically quiescent systems .",
    "we infer that a large fraction of the distorted systems are undergoing a merger , or some type of assembly , based on their structures and the fraction of systems in pairs with another drop - out .",
    "we find that the pair fraction is very similar to the inferred merger fraction as measured through the cas system .",
    "we conclude that the distorted systems are those assembling , possible through mergers , while the smooth and symmetric systems are in a temporary relaxed phase .",
    "we in fact discover a remarkable correlation between the light concentration of non - asymmetric , non - peculiar objects , and the half - light radii of these systems",
    ". this correlation does not exist for asymmetric galaxies , which generally shows a large scatter in sizes at each concentration .",
    "this suggests that the symmetrical galaxies are not currently undergoing a merger , and were thus not formed through the merger process .",
    "based on the sizes , and likely internal velocities for these systems , we calculate that these galaxies formed @xmath62 0.5 gyr before we observe them .",
    "this implies that some of these galaxies initial formation must be nearly as old as the universe itself , although we can not rule out merger events at @xmath9 .",
    "we calculate time - scales for the merging process , and find that massive galaxies with m@xmath6 undergo a merger every 1 - 2 gyr at @xmath202 . by integrating the galaxy merger rate per galaxy , between @xmath4 and @xmath84 we infer that between 2.5 - 7 mergers occur for massive galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "most of this merging occurs at @xmath83 , and by @xmath203 , every massive galaxy has undergone at least a single merger . to make further progress in our",
    "understanding the role of mergers in galaxy formation will require a better knowledge of the time - scales for merging ( see conselice 2009 ; paper iv ) .",
    "this , rather than measures of the merger fraction , is the limiting aspect for deciphering how mergers are driving the evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "our best estimate , using the merger time - scale derived in paper iv , is that the total number of mergers for m@xmath6 galaxies at @xmath7 is 4.2@xmath204 .",
    "we finally investigate how the merger properties of our drop - outs relate to the ongoing star formation rate , as measured through the uv light emitted from the same systems .",
    "we generally find no strong correlation between the star formation rate and the cas or size parameters , although there is an indication that more concentrated and larger galaxies have higher star formation rates .",
    "we also find a tentative higher star formation rate for distorted galaxies , in comparison to smoother systems .",
    "finally , we show that our smooth galaxies have a formation time - scale similar to the merger time - scale , and that what we might be seeing is a population of galaxies in ongoing or post - merging activity .",
    "our merger rate calculations suggest that up to 2 gyr occurs between merging events for these systems , allowing them time to become smooth relaxed systems , which we can see in the correlation between size and concentration index .",
    "this merging continues down to @xmath205 , as seen in several other papers , including paper i of this series ( conselice et al .",
    "after this , disk galaxies become common and major merging ends as a dominate assembly method for forming the masses of galaxies .",
    "while these observations probe nearly the beginning of galaxy assembly , there is still the possibility that some even early initial formation events 0.5 gyr earlier than @xmath4 occurred .",
    "making further progress on the initial formation of galaxies will require resolve imaging of @xmath9 galaxies . because the wfc3 on hubble will have a courser resolution than acs",
    ", it will be difficult to examine higher redshift galaxies in similar ways , even if a suitable @xmath9 population is identified .",
    "it is likely that jwst or ground - based adaptive optics of selected sources will be required to probe the earlier phases of galaxy formation , utilising structures , than what we have examined in this paper .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the structures , sizes , star formation rates , and local environmental properties of galaxies at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 gyr ) , utilising deep hubble space telescope imaging of the hubble ultra deep field . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies we study are selected with the lyman - break drop - out technique , using galaxies which are b-,v- , and @xmath2drops , which effectively selects uv bright starbursting galaxies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our primary observational finding is that starbursting galaxies at @xmath5 have a diversity in structure , with roughly 30% appearing distorted and asymmetric , while the majority are smooth and apparently undisturbed systems . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize several methods to compute the inferred assembly rates for these distorted early galaxies including utilising the cas system and pair counts . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find a similar fraction of galaxies which are in pairs as the fraction which have a distorted structure . </S>",
    "<S> using the cas methodology , and our best - estimate for merger time - scales , we find that the total number of inferred effective mergers for m@xmath6 galaxies at @xmath7 is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the more common symmetrical systems display a remarkable scaling relation between the concentration of light and their half - light radii , revealing the earliest known galaxy scaling relationship , and demonstrating that some galaxies at @xmath5 are likely in a relaxed state . </S>",
    "<S> systems which are asymmetric do not display a correlation between size and half - light radii , and are generally larger than the symmetric smooth systems . </S>",
    "<S> the time - scale for the formation of these smooth systems is 0.5 - 1 gyr , suggesting that most of these galaxies are formed through coordinated very rapid gas collapses and star formation over a size of 1 - 2 kpc , or from merger events at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we finally investigate the relation between the uv measured star formation rates for these galaxies and their structures , finding a slight correlation such that more asymmetric systems have slightly higher star formation rates than symmetric galaxies .    </S>",
