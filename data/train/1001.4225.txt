    "therefore , the observed variation of @xmath50 is considered to reflect the degree of screening by the metallic gate .    here , several points need to be addressed .",
    "first , we note that the path length slightly changes with @xmath42 since the distance between the edge channel and the gate changes with @xmath42",
    ". however , the change ( estimated to be a few 100 nm ) is negligibly small as compared with the total path length ( a few 100 @xmath40 m ) .",
    "moreover , the path length increases as @xmath42 is made more negative , which does not account for the earlier arrival of the emp pulse .",
    "second , the delay gates have complicated shapes with varying widths ( @xmath52 @xmath40 m ) and corners as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup](b ) .",
    "although this may cause the screening strength to vary locally , the observed linearity to @xmath41 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_length](c ) ] and smooth variation with @xmath42 [ fig .",

    "third , electrostatics shows that , at the bulk filling factor @xmath2 , the edge of the 2deg consists of two wide compressible strips separated by , a much narrower , incompressible strip with local filling factor @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite the data shown in this paper , which were taken at @xmath54 , should in principle correspond to the charge distribution in the outer compressible strip .",
    "however , no qualitative difference was observed when @xmath55 was set at @xmath56 to detect the charge distribution in the inner compressible strip .",
    "this suggests that the emp pulse is spread over the two compressible strips and its properties may be well characterized by the edge channel of the lowest spin - unresolved landau level .",
    "the dispersion relation and the group velocity @xmath50 of emps have been investigated theoretically in the long - wavelength limit for different boundary conditions . in the case of unscreened 2deg for the etched edge , @xcite the velocity @xmath50 at wave number @xmath57 for the fundamental emp mode",
    "is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dielectric constant of gaas and @xmath60 is the form factor of the order of 1 , which depends on the electron density profile around the edge channel .",
    "the @xmath61 is the characteristic width in which the emp is mainly confined transversely to the edge channel . on the other hand , in the case of screened 2deg with a surface metal [ fig .",
