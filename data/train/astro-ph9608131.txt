    "anisotropies in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are now widely accepted as the best probe of early universe , which can potentially provide information over a whole range of cosmological parameters ( jungman et al .",
    "1996 ; zaldarriaga , spergel & seljak 1996 ) .",
    "the main advantage of cmb anisotropies as opposed to other , more local probes , is that they are sensitive to the universe in the linear regime , which statistical properties can easily be calculated starting from ab - initio theoretical models and compared to the observations",
    ". a dozen or so cosmological parameters could be extracted from the observations produced by the future satellite and ground based experiments .",
    "there are two potential problems in this program .",
    "first is the somewhat uncertain amount of galactic and extragalactic foregrounds , which could severely limit our ability to extract cosmological signal from the data .",
    "second is the degeneracies among some of the cosmological parameters , which allows only certain combinations to be determined accurately , but does not allow to break the degeneracies between them ( bond et al .",
    "1995 ; jungman et al .",
    "1996 ; zaldarriaga et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate other independent confirmations of results produced from cmb anisotropies and it has long been recognized that polarization in the microwave sky might provide such an independent test ( rees 1968 , polnarev 1985 , bond & efstathiou 1987 , crittenden , davis & steinhardt 1993 , frewin , polnarev & coles 1994 , coulson , crittenden & turok 1994 , crittenden , coulson & turok 1995 ) . like temperature anisotropy , polarization probes the universe in the linear regime and so can provide information useful to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "it is specially important for determining parameters which are only weakly constrained by the cmb anisotropies alone , such as the epoch of reionization or the presence of tensor perturbations . in both of these cosmic variance",
    "is the limiting factor in our capability of extracting the parameters , so measuring polarization would increase the amount of information and allow for a more accurate determination of the parameters . both polarization - polarization and polarization - temperature correlation give an independent set of power spectra , which have different sensitivity to different parameters , so combining them results in a much larger information about the underlying cosmological model and can significantly increase our capability of extracting useful information from the cmb measurements .",
    "the main disadvantage of polarization is that it is predicted to be of a rather low amplitude , of the order of 10% of temperature anisotropy , so measuring it represents an experimental challenge that has yet to be overcome .",
    "currently there are no positive detections of polarization , with the best upper limits of the order of @xmath4 ( wollack et al .",
    "this situation needs not continue in the future , however , as the experimental sensitivity increases and new larger and better experiments are being planned .",
    "moreover , as shown in this paper , cosmologically induced polarization has a unique signature in the data that can not be mimicked by other foregrounds and provides a clear test of the searched signal .",
    "an experiment at brown ( timbie 1996 ) plans to reach sensitivities of a few @xmath5 , which should be sufficient to detect the polarization signal if our current expectations are correct .",
    "interferometer observations could be able to extend this to much larger areas of the sky and produce maps of polarization both in real space and in frequency space .",
    "unfortunately , at present none of the planned interferometer experiments is including polarization , although as argued in this paper frequency space has many advantages in search for the unique signature of cosmological polarization .",
    "finally , all sky satellite maps of polarization are also planned by map and cobras / samba satellites and may eventually provide us with very high accuracy maps of polarization pattern in the sky .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in  2 statistical properties of polarization parameters",
    "are derived in the small scale limit .",
    "special nature of polarization induced by scalar perturbations allows one to use statistical methods developed in the context of weak lensing ( kaiser 1992 ) . in ",
    "3 various 2-point estimators are presented both in fourier and real space , together with their variances and covariances .",
    " 4 is devoted to the foregrounds and possible methods of their elimination .",
    "polarization induced by tensor modes is discussed in  5 and the difference between the two types of perturbations is highlighted . in ",
    "6 theoretical predictions for polarization are computed for a variety of cosmological models and the ability to extract them with the satellite missions is discussed .",
    "this is followed by conclusions in  7 .",
    "in this section we derive the small - scale limit of temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "this limit is of special interest , because one can replace the general spherical expansion with the fourier expansion and the expressions simplify considerably .",
    "the analysis in this section will be restricted to polarization generated by scalar perturbations .",
    "tensor perturbations are discussed in  5 .",
    "in general one can describe cmb polarization as a 2x2 temperature perturbation tensor @xmath6 .",
    "stokes parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( we will ignore @xmath7 in the following , since it can not be generated through thomson scattering ) are defined as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while temperature anisotropy is just its trace , @xmath10 .",
    "the components are defined with respect to a fixed coordinate system @xmath11 perpendicular to the photon direction @xmath12 .",
    "the stokes parameter @xmath0 is positive if temperature perturbation is larger along the @xmath13 relative to the @xmath14 axis , while @xmath1 parameter is positive if perturbation is larger along the upper right diagonal relative to the upper left diagonal .",
    "equations of radiative transfer for polarization and temperature anisotropy simplify in fourier space if we work in a frame with the axis defined parallel and perpendicular to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angle between the wavevector @xmath17 and photon direction @xmath12 .",
    "azimuthal symmetry guarantees that the thomson scattering preserves the diagonal form of @xmath18 , just like in the case of plane - parallel atmospheres ( chandrasekhar 1960 , kaiser 1983 ) . in terms of the stokes parameters only @xmath0",
    "is excited in this frame .",
    "this puts a restriction on the general form of polarization and as we show below it can be used to separate cosmologically induced polarization from other sources and systematic effects .",
    "although only @xmath0 is present in this frame , when we rotate polarization by an azimuthal angle @xmath19 to a fixed frame in the sky we generate both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . at the observers",
    "position the expressions for @xmath20 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given by ( bond & efstathiou 1987 , kosowsky 1996 ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the fourier components of temperature and polarization distribution function integrated over the momentum and @xmath12 is the direction of observation on the sky .",
    "the expression for rotation angle @xmath23 depends both on @xmath17 and @xmath12 , but if we restrict our attention to the directions @xmath12 around the pole then it can be approximated with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the azimuthal angle of vector @xmath17 .",
    "this approximation breaks down for wavemodes @xmath17 close to the pole ( @xmath26 direction ) , but for sufficiently small scales the contribution from these modes to the total power becomes negligible .",
    "the solution for @xmath22 can be written as an integral over the sources along the line of sight ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the source functions for temperature and polarization and can be expressed in terms of metric , baryon and photon perturbations ( see seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 for their explicit expressions ) . by combining equations [ tqu ] and [ formal ] we can write the complete solutions for @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the only term that depends on the direction @xmath12 in equation [ formal ] is the exponential .",
    "the expressions for polarization can therefore be simplified by noting that for the directions @xmath12 near the pole @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be written in terms of second derivatives with respect to @xmath34 , the 2-dimensional projection of @xmath12 onto fixed @xmath11 plane perpendicular to the pole .",
    "this leads to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the inverse 2-d laplacian with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the components of @xmath34 in the fixed basis on the sky .",
    "because @xmath39 depend only on the angle between the two vectors one can expand them in legendre series , @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the rms values for @xmath42 can be obtained by solving the boltzmann equation in differential form or the integral solution itself ( bond & efstathiou 1987 , seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .    each of the observable quantities @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be expanded on a sphere into spherical harmonics or their derivatives , @xmath43 the statistical properties of @xmath44 coefficients follow from equation [ alm ] above , @xmath45 the cross - correlation between temperature and polarization is given by @xmath46    because we are only interested in @xmath12 near the pole one can approximate the sphere locally as a plane , in which case instead of spherical decomposition we may use plane wave expansion . in this limit",
    "we replace @xmath47 with @xmath48 ( and analogously for temperature anisotropy as the amplitude of a wavevector that corresponds to @xmath49 ( bond 1996 ) . ] ) .",
    "differential operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 acting on @xmath52 become simple again and bring out @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , where @xmath55 is the direction angle of 2-dimensional vector @xmath56 with amplitude @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the fourier components of temperature anisotropy and polarization in @xmath56 space and have the statistical properties , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the dirac @xmath63 function as opposed to the kronecker @xmath63 in the discrete case and @xmath49 is assumed to be a continuous function obtained by interpolation from the discrete spectrum defined in equation [ cl ] .    to generate a map of temperature anisotropy and polarization one proceeds in the following way",
    ". for each pair of vectors @xmath56 , @xmath64 on a discrete mesh one diagonalizes the correlation matrix @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath57 is the amplitude of vector @xmath56 .",
    "one then generates from a normalized gaussian distribution two pairs of random numbers and multiplies them with the amplitudes given by the square root of the correlation matrix eigenvalues .",
    "rotating this vector pair back to the original frame gives a realization of @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( and their complex conjugates corresponding to @xmath64 ) , from which follow @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "fourier transform of @xmath20 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 back into the real space gives a map of these quantities in the sky in the small - scale limit , with the correct auto and cross correlations among all the quantities .",
    "note that this differs from the prescription given in bond & efstathiou 1987 .",
    "the 2-point correlations can be calculated either in angular or in frequency ( fourier ) space .",
    "while the two are related via a fourier transform , there are certain advantages to the analysis performed in frequency space . in the first subsection",
    "we explore this approach , while the correlation function approach and the comparison between the two are explored in the next subsection .      from a map of @xmath70 , @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 we can obtain their analogs in frequency space by fourier transform , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 stands for @xmath20 , @xmath0 or @xmath1 . using the expressions given in the previous section one",
    "obtains the two - point functions of these quantities , @xmath75 we see that the correlations in polarization give rise to a very characteristic anisotropy pattern in @xmath56 space .",
    "this arises from the fact that polarization was not generated from a general mechanism , but rather through a process of thomson scattering , which can not generate @xmath1 and @xmath7 components in the @xmath17 dependent frame defined in previous section .",
    "this characteristic anisotropy can therefore be used to separate true signal from instrumental artifacts and foregrounds , which is discussed in more detail in next section . alternatively ,",
    "if foregrounds can be kept under control one can use the characteristic anisotropy to separate scalar induced polarization from the one induced by vector or tensor modes , which do not obey the same anisotropy pattern (  5 ) .    to estimate the sensitivity that is possible to achieve in a measurement of polarization power spectrum let us assume the measurements are given on a square grid of @xmath76 pixels with a total solid angle @xmath77 .",
    "the antenna beam smearing will be described with @xmath78 . in the case of single dish observations with a gaussian beam",
    "this is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the gaussian size of the beam .",
    "in the case of interferometers @xmath78 is either 1 or 0 , depending on whether the particular frequency is observed or not .",
    "we will assume that different measurements are uncorrelated by taking mesh spacing large enough to ignore correlations induced by finite window ( hobson & magueijo 1996 ) .",
    "in the case of single dish experiments each pixel in real space has a noise contribution with rms noise amplitudes @xmath81 , @xmath82 for temperature and both components of polarization , respectively ( we assume for simplicity that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are being measured equal amounts of time ) .",
    "we will also assume that noise is uncorrelated between different pixels and between different polarization components @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is only the simplest possible choice and more complicated noise correlations arise if all the components are obtained from a single set of observations . in the case of brown polarization experiment ( timbie 1996 ) the polarization measurements will be made by rotating the antenna axis by @xmath83 , each time measuring directly the difference between the two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "this would therefore provide a direct measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components with no noise mixing between them . in the case of interferometers each pixel in @xmath56 space is measured directly and the noise is uncorrelated between individual pixels in frequency space . following knox 1995",
    "we will introduce pixel independent measure of noise @xmath84 for single dish experiments and @xmath85 for interferometers ( see hobson & magueijo 1996 for expressions that relate @xmath86 to the receiver sensitivity ) . for cross - correlation between temperature and polarization",
    "there are two simple cases to be considered . in one",
    "the cross - correlation is being made with two different maps , in which case noise is uncorrelated . in the second case",
    "both temperature and polarization are obtained from the same experiment by adding and differenciating the two polarization states . in this case noise in temperature and polarization",
    "are related via @xmath87 . in both cases noise in temperature",
    "is uncorrelated with noise in polarization components , so the final expressions are identical .",
    "the first step is to construct a discrete fourier transform of the map , @xmath88 . using the observed quantities",
    "@xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 we can form power spectrum estimates .",
    "the simplest one is for temperature anisotropy , which for single dish observations is given by @xmath92 -w^{-1}_t \\right]b^{-2}(l),\\ ] ] where the term @xmath93 accounts for beam smearing and @xmath94 is the number of independent modes around @xmath57 .",
    "the expression for interferometers is the same without the beam smearing term and summing only over the observed modes in frequency space .",
    "we will only present expressions for single dish here , as the modification for interferometers is obvious .",
    "each mode @xmath89 is a complex random variable with 0 mean and variance @xmath95 .",
    "the variance on estimator @xmath96 for a single pair of modes @xmath89 , @xmath97 is therefore @xmath95 .",
    "if we average over @xmath94 modes the variance is reduced by @xmath98 .",

    "although the characteristic anisotropy is present also in the correlation functions , it is more complicated , because there are actually two independent correlation functions for polarization , @xmath116 both of which of course depend on the same underlying power spectrum . moreover , the prior @xmath117 becomes a set of integral constraints in real space , which is more difficult to impose on the estimators obtained from the data .",
    "all this argues for fourier space analysis as the method of choice in the case of polarization .",
    "expressions above agree with those derived by coulson et al .",
    "1994 and kosowsky 1996 , which for @xmath118 and @xmath119 are also only valid in the small scale limit , but where this limit has not been consistently applied to all the steps , so that their final expressions look much more complicated than they actually are .",
    "they contain a term involving double summation over @xmath120 , @xmath121 in the @xmath113 dependent term , which as shown in appendix reduces to the expressions above if one consistently applies small scale limit to their expression .",
    "all the information about polarization is therefore contained in @xmath122 and @xmath123 . note that taking the fourier transform of @xmath118 or @xmath119 correlation function does not result in the power spectrum of @xmath122 , but has an additional @xmath113 dependent term that involves a double integral of @xmath124 and @xmath125 over @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "although generally smaller than @xmath122 , this integral does not vanish in general , hence the appearance of such terms in expressions by coulson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and kosowsky ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is of course not the optimal way to obtain the power spectrum from the correlation function . to obtain an estimate of the underlying power spectrum",
    "it is better to work in the fourier domain directly , following the methods given in previous subsection .",
    "one can use the measured temperature maps to predict the polarization pattern .",
    "the estimator is @xmath128 where by minimizing the variance @xmath129 ^ 2\\rangle= \\cos^2(2\\phi_{\\vec{l } } ) [ \\alpha^2c_{tl}-2\\alpha c_{cl}+c_{pl}]\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath1 one finds @xmath130 , so that the fractional variance in the estimator is @xmath131 ^ 2\\rangle \\over q(\\vec{l})^2 } = 1-\\rm{corr}(t , p)_l^2.\\ ] ] the correlation coefficient is defined as @xmath132 .",
    "figure [ fig1]d shows that the correlation coefficient typically ranges between @xmath133 and @xmath134 and so the fractional variance will be at best around 0.8 or so in @xmath56 space and even larger than that in real space , where one averages over positive and negative cross - correlations in power spectrum .",
    "this is not very impressive in terms of predicting where to look for large polarization amplitude , although in a statistical sense one is still much more likely to find a high signal at a high @xmath135 peak in the temperature map than at a random point ( coulson et al .",
    "1994 ) . on large angular scales ( @xmath136 )",
    "the correlation coefficient can be much larger and approaches unity in some models , so that the expressions in this limit would actually give a good correspondence between observed and predicted polarization .",
    "unfortunately , the amplitude of polarization is extremely small on these scales and there is little hope to measure it in the near future even with the help of this `` matching filter '' technique .",
    "although several galactic and extragalactic foregrounds are significant in the case of temperature measurements , only few of these are polarized and need to be considered for polarization measurements .",
    "radiation from earth atmosphere and bremsstrahlung emission are not polarized at millimeter wavelengths and need not be discussed further ( although atmospheric emission does have an effect by increasing the effective temperature of receiver and adding a fluctuating offset ) .",
    "extragalactic radio sources have synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission mechanism and can be 20% polarized .",
    "their contribution to the polarization signal will be similar as their contribution to the temperature anisotropy signal and so analysis of point source effects on cmb can be directly applied to the case of polarization as well .",
    "this is discussed in more detail by francheschini et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1991 ) and tegmark & efstathiou ( 1996 ) .",
    "point source contamination depends on the observed frequency , angular scale and flux cut above which point sources can be identified and eliminated .",
    "poisson distribution produces a white - noise spectrum and at large angular scales radio point sources do not pose a significant problem .",
    "for example , on angular scales above @xmath137 their contribution is less than @xmath138 at 30 ghz ( timbie 1996 ) , which is below the expected amplitude of the signal and is even less than that at higher frequencies . on smaller angular scales",
    "point sources become more important and more ambitious flux cuts are needed , which limits the area of the sky that can be observed .",
    "while in the case of temperature anisotropy this can be the main limitation of an experiment ( and indeed of the whole cmb field ) , in the case of polarization we do have an additional constraint that allows us to separate cosmologically induced signal from the foregrounds .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "on large angular scales the main foreground contribution comes from our galaxy , where both dust and synchrotron emission can be polarized .",
    "dust emission in the far - infrared is polarized up to 10% ( hildebrand et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the contribution of dust to the lower frequency channels ( where most hemt based polarization measurements are being planned ) is small . at frequencies below 100 ghz",
    "the most important source of polarization is likely to be galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "its linear polarization can reach 70% , so that polarization amplitudes of 50@xmath2k are expected around 30ghz ( cortiglioni & spoelstra 1995 ) .",
    "this drops significantly at higher frequencies and only a few @xmath2k synchrotron contamination in polarization is expected around 100ghz ( timbie 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this is of the same order as the expected signal , so that some further foreground rejection is needed .",
    "one possibility is to use only clean parts of the sky where synchrotron emission is low , such as at high galactic latitudes .",
    "in addition , multifrequency cmb observations can be used to remove the foregrounds , which in the case of only one important foreground with approximately known frequency dependence can be very effective ( brandt et al . 1994 ) .",
    "accuracy of 1@xmath2k can be achieved with only two frequency channels if the noise level is around 1@xmath2k per pixel ( timbie 1996 ) .",
    "another possibility is multifrequency removal using the more sensitive temperature maps .",
    "this would be a useful strategy for example in the case of cobras / samba satellite , where only lower frequency channels will have polarization capabilities , but all frequency channels could be used to determine the local contribution of various foregrounds .",
    "this way one could effectively remove multicomponent foregrounds from polarization even if only a few channels actually measured it .",
    "while each of the foregrounds above can in principle be removed from the data , in practice this may not always be possible at the levels of 1@xmath2k and it would be useful to have an additional test of the presence of cosmological signal .",
    "characteristic anisotropy of polarization in fourier space provides such a test and gives a unique signature of polarization induced by scalar perturbations .",
    "to test whether the signal is cosmological one needs to compare the quantities @xmath139 and @xmath140 the first quantity contains all the polarization signal and its estimator is given in equation [ optimal ] , while the second quantity vanishes even in the presence of cosmological polarization induced by scalar perturbations .",
    "this is true not just statistically , but for each fourier mode individually .",
    "most of the foregrounds should contribute on average the same amount to both variables .",
    "this is certainly valid for uncorrelated point sources , but even in the case of synchrotron and dust emission the alignment is preferentially determined by magnetic fields , which are not scalar in nature and will not exhibit the characteristic anisotropy in fourier space .",
    "hence the difference between @xmath141 and @xmath142 can be taken as a measure of the cosmological signal as compared to the foregrounds and/or instrumental offsets .",
    "if foregrounds and not noise are expected to be the main limitation then one may use may subtract the power spectrum of @xmath141 from the one for @xmath142 in equation [ optimal ] and no further foreground removal is needed .",
    "one could therefore use this technique to measure polarization even at frequencies below 50ghz , where foreground contribution is large , but could be averaged over if sufficient number of channels are being measured .",
    "note that this test does not depend on the temperature anisotropies at all and can be applied directly to the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to obtain a statistically significant measure of polarization one only needs to show that in an rms sense @xmath141 is larger than @xmath142 . if one is noise and not foreground limited then it is more advantageous to use the optimal estimator in equation [ optimal ] , because subtracting the power spectrum of @xmath142 from the optimal estimator for @xmath141 leads to an increase in noise by @xmath143 . in practice",
    "the actual analysis will depend on the level of foregrounds and other systematics ( e.g. sidelobe pickup ) relative to noise and different estimators must be tested for consistency , but it is important to note that in the case of polarization we have a possibility to use a combination of stokes parameters in which foregrounds can be separated from the cosmological signal , something that can not be achieved in the temperature measurements alone .",
    "discussion in  4 applies only if polarization is produced by scalar perturbations .",
    "while this is certainly a valid approximation on small angular scales ( @xmath144 ) , on larger scales one may be able to detect polarization from non - scalar perturbations , induced either by vector or tensor modes .",
    "the latter are of particular interest , because they are expected to be present in several inflationary based models , although only on large angular scales and with rather small amplitudes ( crittenden et al .",
    "defect models also predict production of both tensor and vector perturbations . in the case of tensor perturbations temperature anisotropy and",
    "the two stokes parameters can be written in the small scale limit as ( bond 1996 , kosowsky 1996 ) , @xmath145 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we defined the orientation of the two polarization states in the plane perpendicular to @xmath148 so that local @xmath13 direction points in the direction of the pole , in which case only @xmath149 contributes to the temperature in the small scale limit .",
    "expectation values for @xmath150 and @xmath147 can be calculated just like in the scalar case by expanding them into a legendre series and solving a system of boltzmann equations ( crittenden et al .",
    "1993 ) or the integral solution ( zaldarriaga & seljak 1996 ) . because of additional @xmath2 terms in equation [ tens ] a more convenient set of variables",

    "one can now follow the same steps as in the case of scalar perturbations , which transform the angle @xmath156 into @xmath55 .",
    "the variables @xmath157 and @xmath158 defined in equation [ fore ] ( where superscript @xmath20 indicates that these are produced by tensor modes ) are independent of the azimuthal angle and the two tensor components decouple , so that @xmath146 contributes only to @xmath157 and @xmath147 contributes only to @xmath158 .",
    "their power spectra can be expressed in terms of integrals over @xmath159 , @xmath160 as , @xmath161 the cross correlation term vanishes because the two tensor polarization states are independent .",
    "the variable @xmath158 does not vanish in the case of tensor perturbations and its power spectrum differs from the power spectrum of @xmath157 . note that different combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will result in different power spectra , which can always be expressed in terms of the two defined above .",
    "just like the cross term between @xmath157 and @xmath158 vanishes so does the cross correlation term between @xmath162 and @xmath158 .",
    "there is only one power spectrum present in the case of temperature - polarization cross correlation , @xmath163 detailed calculations of these spectra have been presented elsewhere ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996b ) .",
    "instead of the power spectrum @xmath49 we will use the quantity @xmath164 , which gives the contribution to the variance per logarithmic interval of @xmath57 .",
    "this is a familiar quantity in the case of temperature anisotropies , where its broad band average is approximately flat up to the damping scale .",
    "predictions for @xmath165 and @xmath166 are given in figures [ fig1]a , b for a variety of cosmological models .",
    "for comparison we also plot the usual @xmath167 in figure [ fig1]c , as well as the correlation coefficient in figure [ fig1]d .",
    "all the model predictions have been computed using cmbfast package by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) .",
    "one can see that typically the models predict very little polarization on large angular scales , below @xmath168 . on smaller angular scales",
    "most of the models predict polarization at the level of 5 - 10@xmath2k .",
    "there are several characteristic features of interest in this regime .",
    "the most important one is that the acoustic peaks are narrower than the corresponding ones in temperature anisotropy",
    ". one can understand this with the help of tight coupling approximation ( hu & sugiyama 1995 ; seljak 1994 ; zaldarriaga & harari 1995 ) . the dominant source of temperature anisotropy are intrinsic photon anisotropy ( @xmath169 ) and velocity ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "both terms oscillate , but are out of phase with each other .",
    "this means that they partially cancel each other and oscillations in the temperature anisotropy are less pronounced than they would be if only one term were contributing .",
    "the dominant source of polarization is photon second moment @xmath171 , so the oscillations are more pronounced than in the case of temperature anisotropy .",
    "these oscillations are even more pronounced in the case of temperature - polarization cross - correlation , which can be either positive or negative .",
    "another characteristic of polarization is that it is not sensitive to the integrated sachs - wolfe term .",
    "this term is responsible for increase in the temperature anisotropies at low @xmath57 , as in models with cosmological constant , curvature or if recombination occurs close to the matter - radiation equality , during which gravitational potential is changing with time .",
    "another class of such models are topological defect models , where small @xmath57 spectrum is dominated by late time integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "a measurement of polarization at a few microkelvin level will put a significant constraint on such models .",
    "one of the parameters that are of special importance for polarization is the optical depth to thomson scattering . as photons propagate through the universe they scatter off free electrons , which were ionized by uv light either from an early generation of stars or from quasars .",
    "current limits give that the universe was mostly ionized up to the redshift of 5 , which results in optical depth of the order of 1% in standard cdm universe and somewhat larger in open or high baryon models .",
    "it is likely that the reionization did not occur much earlier so that the optical depth would exceed unity , because then it would suppress cmb anisotropies on small angular scales , in contrast with recent observational data ( netterfield et al .",
    "1995 , scott et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the exact epoch of reionization remains however unknown and its determination would provide an important constraint to the models of galaxy formation .",
    "temperature anisotropies alone will not be able to constrain this epoch significantly , because even in the most optimistic scenario sensitivity to optical depth @xmath172 is around 10 - 20% ( jungman et al .",
    "this is because reionization is degenerate with the amplitude of fluctuations , which can be only broken at low @xmath57 , where cosmic variance is large .",
    "polarization can help here both because reionization introduces new structure and also simply because the cosmic variance is reduced as more independent realizations are observed . as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , the effect of reionization is to increase somewhat the amplitude of polarization at low @xmath57 , but not by much and the amplitude still remains below 1 - 2@xmath5 .",
    "the effect is better seen in the cross - correlation spectrum and in the corresponding correlation coefficient .",
    "the latter clearly displays the rich structure at low l that allows one to determine epoch of reionization and the integrated optical depth ( zaldarriaga 1996 ) . on smaller angular scales polarization amplitude decreases with optical depth",
    "just like the temperature anisotropy and the ratio of the two remains constant ( bond & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents a more quantitative estimate of sensitivity in the case of satellites , assuming standard cdm as the underlying model .",
    "the middle curve shown is the underlying theoretical model while the two curves above and below show the one standard deviation of the reconstructed spectrum from the true model .",
    "the variances were obtained using equations [ covpl ] and [ covcl ] , assuming 50% sky coverage ( @xmath173 ) and @xmath174 .",
    "we adopted 3 different noise characteristics .",
    "the most optimistic possibility is @xmath175k in @xmath176 beam , which could easily be achieved by cobras / samba satellite with their bolometric detectors .",
    "the intermediate model assumes @xmath177k and @xmath178 beam , which could be feasible with the map satellite by combining their most sensitive channels .",
    "the third model is the most conservative one and assumes @xmath179k and @xmath178 .",
    "all of the sensitivities assume 1 year of observation and longer observation periods would reduce the noise accordingly . from figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we see that only the most optimistic model is capable of constraining the polarization power spectrum significantly . on the other hand , for cross - correlation spectrum the situation is much better and all of the assumed models will give some positive detection , although of course with lower noise levels one will be able to extend this to much smaller angular scales .",
    "this difference between polarization and cross - correlation is to be expected , because noise in temperature is lower and because cross correlation power spectrum has more power than the polarization power spectrum itself . although more detailed calculations are needed to estimate the sensitivity for actual satellites ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is clear that reducing the noise by a factor of 2 leads to a significant improvement in the sensitivity to polarization .",
    "polarization in cosmic microwave background has the promise to become the new testing ground of processes in the early universe quite independent of the measurements of temperature anisotropies . the spectrum of polarization , while lower in signal than the temperature anisotropies , can be more sensitive to certain parameters such as reionization or gravity waves . even for the determination of the standard parameters polarization",
    "provides some advantages , for example , acoustic oscillation peaks are much more prominent and so can be more easily detected .",
    "in addition to the spectrum of polarization one can also determine the spectrum of temperature - polarization cross - correlation .",
    "two additional spectra can help to break some of the degeneracies present in the estimation of cosmological parameters .",
    "this is specially important for those parameters whose precision is limited by cosmic variance , because polarization provides additional independent realizations of initial conditions in the universe .",
    "even though measurements in polarization are not likely to achieve the same level of precision as in the case of temperature anisotropies , polarization still has some advantages that may prove crucial if the amplitude and complexity of galactic foregrounds and extragalactic point sources have been significantly underestimated .",
    "multifrequency subtraction is simpler in the case of polarization , because fewer foregrounds are polarized and need to be modeled .",
    "more importantly , polarization induced by scalar perturbations has a unique signature in fourier space and by exploiting this one may separate cosmological signal from other sources of polarization .",
    "although the analysis in this paper has been limited to small scales it has recently been shown that the same property is also valid in the more general all - sky analysis ( zaldarriaga & seljak 1996 ; kamionkowski , kosowsky & stebbins 1996 )",
    ". this signature would be especially important if the level of foregrounds is significantly larger than expected . while one would not be able to remove the foregrounds from the temperature maps , a combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "stokes parameters would allow one to subtract statistically the effects of foregrounds the case of polarization",
    ". this technique would be feasible both for interferometer measurements or for measurements with a large coverage of the sky such as the forthcoming satellite missions .",
    "the sensitivity of satellites will be sufficient for an unambiguous determination of polarization and indeed polarization may prove to be crucial to break some of the degeneracies present in the parameter reconstruction from the temperature anisotropies alone ( zaldarriaga et al .",
    "finally , if foregrounds can be controlled , then a unique signature of tensor ( or vector ) perturbations could be directly observed , although this would require an exquisite understanding of noise properties , systematics and foregrounds at the level of 0.5@xmath5 .",
    "given the unique nature of information present in the microwave background and its simple linear depence on the underlying cosmological parameters it is important to explore it at its maximum , which certainly includes polarization as one of its main components .",
    "i would like to thank douglas scott , arthur kosowsky , david spergel , martin white and specially matias zaldarriaga for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we show how the small scale limit of correlation functions @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( equations [ corrf ] ) follows from the expression derived by coulson et al .",
    "we start from their expression ( correcting for missing factors of 1/2 ) , @xmath180 \\nonumber \\\\ c_{ppl}&=&{(l-4 ) !",
    "\\over ( l+4 ) ! } \\sum_{l'}(2l'+1)\\int k^2dk \\delta_{pl ' } \\delta_{pl}a^4_{l'l},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 is the legendre polynomial and @xmath182 the associated legendre function of 4th order .",
    "coefficients @xmath183 have a closed form expression ( coulson 1994 ) and in the large @xmath57 limit they peak at @xmath184 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath185 is a rapidly oscillating function of @xmath155 and for @xmath186 the integral over @xmath155 leads to almost complete cancellation of @xmath187 . thus in this limit",
    "one can write @xmath188 where we used the @xmath184 closed form for of @xmath189 ( coulson 1994 ) . furthermore , in the @xmath190 limit legendre functions can be written as @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the bessel function of order @xmath193 . combining all the expressions",
    "leads to @xmath194 correlation function given in equation [ corrf ] .",
    "other correlation functions in equation [ corrf ] can be derived from the expressions in coulson et al .",
    "1994 using similar manipulations .",
    "numerical results presented in zaldarriaga & seljak 1996 show that small scale approximation derived here is an excellent approximation everywhere except at very small @xmath57 ( @xmath195 ) .",
