    "it has been known for years that the observed energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays can be well described by an inverse power law in the energy @xmath4 of charged particles ( mainly protons ) from @xmath5 to around @xmath6 ev @xcite as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the flux in @xmath9",
    ". however , the index @xmath10 reveals some abrupt changes as follows : @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are often called the first and second  knee \" while @xmath14 the  ankle \" in the cosmic ray spectrum ( crs ) . in 1966 ,",
    "greisen , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite pointed out that nearly no proton with energy higher than @xmath15 ev ( the gzk cutoff ) can reach the earth .",
    "the reasons are as follows : a proton will lose its energy via a resonant scattering process with a photon in the 2.7 k cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation : @xmath16 to create a @xmath17 , which decays into some baryon @xmath18 and @xmath19 meson .",
    "then @xmath18 may decay back to a proton again .",
    "for every mean free path @xmath20 mpc of travel , the proton loses @xmath21 of its energy on average @xcite .",
    "a proton produced from a cosmic source ( say , an active galastic nucleus , agn ) at distance @xmath22 with an initial @xmath23 will on average at earth have only a fraction @xmath24 of @xmath23 .",
    "a distance @xmath22 of @xmath25 mpc will lead to an order of energy degradation ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "so 60 mpc could be set as a limit within which a proton of hecr with energy @xmath23 beyond the gzk cutoff can reach the earth .",
    "however , no agn sources are known within 60 mpc of earth .    beginning from 1980 s ,",
    "a number of observational facts and theoretical predictions challenged the above claim .",
    "right after theankle \" energy @xmath14 , the cosmic ray spectrum rises again and beyond the gzk cutoff @xcite . although the experimental evidence of these hecrs is still a controversial problem today , a possible mechanism called the z - burst model ( zbm )",
    "was proposed first by weiler @xcite and then by fargion _",
    "@xcite to explain why the gzk cutoff could be evaded ? in zbm , it was assumed that an ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrino @xmath27 ( or antineutrino @xmath28 ) from the remote cosmic space could annihilate with a nonrelativistic relic @xmath28 ( or @xmath27 ) in the space within distance @xmath29 mpc to produce a @xmath30 meson : @xmath31 weiler considered that the neutrino has a nonzero @xmath32 so that the resonant process ( 3 ) can be triggered at a peak energy @xmath33 within an interval @xmath34 gev ( @xmath35 , the natural width of @xmath30 with mass @xmath36 gev @xcite ) : @xmath37 if assume @xmath38 , @xmath39 ev . the resonant cross - section was estimated around @xmath40 and a hadronic @xmath41-burst would decay to , on average , 30 photons and 2.7 nucleons @xcite ( or 2 protons @xcite ) with energy near or above the gzk cutoff .",
    "@xcite further proposed that the following @xmath42 channel reaction chains may be more promising over the @xmath30 channel ( 3 ) : @xmath43 there are two difficulties in the above z(w)bm .",
    "first , the flux of uhe @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) may be not strong enough ( the upper bound on the flux is @xmath44 for @xmath45 ev ) .",
    "second , the density of relic @xmath28 ( or @xmath27 ) may be too low .",
    "the latter difficulty is related to the theory of cosmology : around 1 second after the big bang , when temperature was about @xmath46 k ( @xmath47 1 mev ) , relativistic neutrinos decoupled and evolved into nonrelativistic relic neutrinos today .",
    "now the neutrino temperature is estimated to be @xmath48 k ( @xmath49 k is the photon temperature of cmb ) .",
    "the mean neutrino ( or antineutrino ) number density for each flavor is @xmath50 @xmath51 , which seems too low for them to be served as target neutrinos in the z(w)bm . to overcome this difficulty , some authors assumed that @xcite the relic neutrinos have coalesced into ",
    "neutrino cloud \" , which might be a sphere with radius in the range of @xmath52 cm ( i.e. , @xmath53 au ) and has a density in the range of @xmath54 @xmath51 .",
    "many other authors , e.g. in @xcite , believe that neutrinos may be a part of so - called hot dark matter ( hdm ) and may cluster in the halo of every galaxy , reaching a density @xmath55 @xmath51 for each flavor .    to our understanding ,",
    "the massive neutrino discussed by previous literatures on z(w)bm is basically a dirac particle . in this paper",
    "we will pose an alternative point of view that neutrino is , very likely , a tachyon ( whose property will be reviewed in section ii ) .",
    "this is because the most convincing explanation for two knees in the crs is focused on the tachyonic nature of neutrino ( section iv ) .",
    "after a brief discussion on how neutrinos can be attached to a neutron star and reach a density about @xmath56 @xmath51 ( for each flavor ) ( section iii ) , we will discuss the kinematics of z(w)bm in section v rigorously , like that for two knees , based on two ( momentum and energy ) conservation laws . then in section",
    "vi , we will claim that the evasion of gzk cutoff might provide the second strong evidence for the tachyonic nature of neutrino and could be verified further via possible observations that most protons in the hecr should be right - handed polarized .",
    "once this can be tested by experiments , the maximum violation of parity conservation law discovered in 1956 - 1957 will be highly emphasized again ( see find section vii ) .",
    "three appendices are added for further clarifications .",
    "a dirac particle with rest mass @xmath57 obeys the dirac equation ( @xmath58 ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are two - component spinors while @xmath62 the pauli matrices . if one defines @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) can be recast into the wely representation : @xmath64 there are two symmetries hidden in the dirac equation .",

    "( [ eq:8 ] ) is invariant under the pure space inversion ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68 interesting enough , eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) violates the third symmetry  the ( newly defined ) pure time inversion ( @xmath69 ) with @xmath70 to maximum .",
    "note that the so - called  time reversal ( t ) \" was introduced to quantum mechanics ( qm ) since 1932 .",
    "but actually , the t transformation was a misnorner @xcite , it is merely a  reversal of motion \" , including an operation of complex conjugation on the wave function ( wf ) in qm .",
    "a  pure time inversion \" should be defined as ( @xmath69 ) without complex conjugation , it is obviously violated not only in nonrelativistic qm @xcite , but also in the dirac equation as shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "now let us compare the dirac equation with a new equation for neutrino proposed in ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite and appendix 9b of @xcite ) : @xmath71 here the subscripts of fields @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) refer to three flavors of neutrinos @xmath75 , they have no mass term originally but are coupled together via one parameter @xmath76 . in this",

( [ eq:12 ] ) remains invariant after we define @xmath82    however , eq .  ( 12 ) is no longer invariant under the space inversion ( 10 ) ( with subscript @xmath83 ) .",
    "this is because the opposite signs in the @xmath76 terms which not only lead to the minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) , implying the tachyon nature of neutrino , but also endow the neutrino a property of maximum violation in parity  there are only left - handed neutrino @xmath84 and right - handed antineutrino @xmath85 existing in nature ( there is no @xmath86 and @xmath87 as verified by the experiment @xcite ) .",
    "interesting enough , these two properties are linked intimately  the permanent polarization of a neutrino can be maintained because its velocity @xmath88 whereas an observer s velocity @xmath89 .",
    "more interesting thing is : eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) remains invariant under the pure - time inversion ( @xmath90 ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) ( adding subscript @xmath83 ) , just relying on the opposite signs in @xmath76 terms . due to the basic space - time invariant eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) , a pure time inversion will transform a neutrino into antineutrino with the same energy but the opposite momenta .",
    "we will see its strange consequence in the explanation of crs ( section iv and appendix b ) .    now eqs .",

    "however , in the model like eqs .",
    "( [ eq:12])-([eq:16 ] ) , if a neutrino @xmath97 or @xmath98 is just created from the decay process and staying in three mass - eigenstates , say , @xmath99 with @xmath100 having tachyon mass square @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , then the neutrino mass square @xmath92 can only take values @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath104 with probability ratio @xmath105 respectively .",

    "so we suggest that if our experimental physicists manage to treat their data in a two - center fitting ( with ratio @xmath107 in ( @xmath108 ) value and statistical weight ratio @xmath109 ) , better results could be achieved .",

    "\\(c ) the accurate data of sno group @xcite showed that the flux of solar neutrinos is likely composed of equal amount of three flavors : @xmath114 in our opinion , eq .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) just means that the oscillation among three flavors is not a coherent one like that shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq:22 ] ) , but a noncoherent one regardless of the inertial condition .",
    "this is only possible because the group velocity @xmath115 exceeds the phase velocity @xmath116 , thus destroying the coherence of wave packets and leaving the oscillation merely as a mechanism to establish the detailed balancing among three flavors . for further discussion , see appendices b and c.",
    "before discussing the crs in following section , let us consider the possibility of neutrinos clustering in the cosmic space . according to the theory of cosmology",
    ", both neutrinos and antineutrinos are prevailing over the space isotropically .",
    "they have an average kinetic energy @xmath117 ev per particle with a temperature @xmath118 k. what we try to add is two hypotheses :    \\(a ) they are , most likely , tachyons with a ( real and positive ) tachyon mass @xmath119 ev@xmath120 ( see next section ) . under good approximation , the average energy of a tachyon neutrino in the cosmos can be evaluated to be @xmath121 ( rather than @xmath122 ) .",
    "\\(b ) the newton s gravitation law should be complemented according to the invariance of mass inversion ( @xmath123 ) , which is equivalent to the invariance of space - time inversion ( at the qm level ) , showing the symmetry between particle and antiparticle  an essence of special relativity ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "hence antineutrinos will be repealed by the matter galaxies , only neutrinos can be attracted by some celestial body to form a cluster , which might be a component of the dark matter .    for simplicity , consider a celestial body having mass @xmath124 distributing uniformly in a sphere with radius @xmath125 .",
    "then its gravitational potential reads : @xmath126 if a neutrino has kinetic energy @xmath127 , it will escape from the trap of this celestial body .",
    "for example , typical star like our sun with @xmath128 kg , @xmath129 m , @xmath130 ev . a white dwarf has @xmath131 , and @xmath132 m , @xmath133 ev .",
    "so either a star or a dwarf can not capture neutrinos into its trap .",
    "however , a neutron star has @xmath134 , and @xmath135 m , so @xmath136 . on the other hand , though a black hole has @xmath137 , no @xmath30 or @xmath138 created by process ( [ eq:3 ] ) or ( [ eq:5 ] ) can escape from the black hole .",
    "so we will not consider it .",
    "( if consider a galaxy roughly as a sphere with radius @xmath139 ly and mass @xmath140 , so we will not consider the neutrino clustering in a galaxy either . )",

    "so the neutrinos trapped inside them could be served as targets for uhe antineutrinos incident from the remote space , creating @xmath30 and @xmath151 mesons to escape from the neutron star .",
    "however , the total mass of these clustering neutrinos seems still quite low .",
    "the so - called dark matter in cosmology is still a mystery to us .",
    "the appearance of two knees in the crs strongly hint that there is a new reaction channel suddenly opened at the threshold energy @xmath152 or @xmath153 respectively as shown in eq .",
