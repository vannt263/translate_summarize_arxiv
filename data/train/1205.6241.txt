    "in this paper , we apply time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) to calculate coherent phonon generation in crystalline solids .",
    "there is fairly clear separation between adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes for this process , depending on the the material and the frequency of the external electromagnetic field .",
    "we first summarize the physical aspects of the phonon generation .",
    "coherent optical phonons generated by high - intensity , ultrashort laser pulses can be easily observed by pump - probe experiments that are sensitive to the changes in the index of refraction of the probed material . in particular , the phases of the phonons can be extracted from the reflectivity change plotted against the delay time of the reflected probe pulse .",
    "these experiments have been done for many kinds of materials .",
    "the coupling to optical phonons is especially strong in the semimetals bi and sb , and our calculations here will be for crystalline sb .",
    "an example of the kind of data that motivates this choice are shown in fig .",
    "[ ishioka ] @xcite .",
    "the pump and the probe pulses are directed on the @xmath0 $ ] surface of a sb crystal at nearly normal incidence . the change in the reflectivity of the probe pulse is measured as a function of the delay between the pump and the probe .",
    "one sees an oscillatory pattern whose frequencies can be identified with the known optical phonons in the crystal .",
    "the crystal symmetry imposes some conditions between the polarization of the pump pulse and the probe pulse . that information has been used in the experiment to separate the contribution of the @xmath1 phonon from that of the @xmath2 phonon . the signal label ",

    "2a ) ) . ]    for a given phonon , the reflectivity change is often parameterized by the functional form = g e^-t ( _ ph t + ) , where @xmath3 is the amplitude , @xmath4 is the phonon angular frequency , @xmath5 is a damping constant , and @xmath6 is a phase angle .",
    "the phase angle @xmath6 provides a very sensitive measure of the mechanism for the phonon generation .",
    "if the mechanism is adiabatic , the phase angle should be close to @xmath7 , as will be discussed below . typically this is achieved in insulators when the laser photon energy is below the direct band gap .",
    "this is called the `` impulsively stimulated raman scattering '' ( isrs ) mechanism @xcite , because the entire process can be described in terms of the raman couplings for exciting a single phonon by a single photon .",
    "this process occurs for laser pulses whose duration is shorter than the vibrational frequency . in this mechanism ,",
    "the coherent phonon coupling depends only on measurable dielectric properties of the medium .",
    "the equation of motion in the phonon coordinate is given by a simple formula of merlin@xcite , [ ad_eq ] + _ ph^2 q = f(t ) = | e(t)|^2",
    ". here @xmath8 is the phonon coordinate , @xmath9 is a component of the dielectric susceptibility tensor , and @xmath10 is a corresponding component of the electric field .    when real excitations of the medium are possible , another process called the displacive mechanism can contribute as well @xcite .",
    "this mechanism takes place in opaque materials like semimetals and in insulators when the laser frequency is above the direct band gap . in the displacive mechanism ,",
    "the electronic excitations produce a long - term shift in the charge distribution , changing the equilibrium position of the phonon coordinates .",
    "thus the pump pulse produces a state in which the phonon coordinates are displaced from their new equilibrium positions .",
    "if the life - time of the excited charges is sufficiently long , the oscillation of the phonons about the new equilibrium will be given by a cosine functional dependence on the time with respect to the pump pulse .",
    "thus , the displacive mechanism has a phase differing by @xmath7 with respect to the isrs mechanism .    at first sight",
    "it would seem that the isrs and the displacive mechanisms are quite different physical processes . in an attempt to establish a unified description , stevens , kuhl , and merlin ( skm ) proposed a unified model of to describe both isrs and displacive mechanisms in term of the dielectric properties of the medium @xcite .",

    "-^+ e^it e(t ) ^2 dt , where @xmath12 is the laser electric field , @xmath13 is the laser frequency , and @xmath14 is the dielectric function . in sect .",
    "iv below we will compare the formula with the results of the tddft dynamics to assess the reliability of the approximations made in deriving it .",
    "the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic coupling has been observed in crystalline si@xcite as a rather rapid change of phonon phase as the laser photon energy crosses the direct band gap .",
    "we have previously applied tddft to this system and found that it clearly reproduced this transition @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use the same computational framework , but applied to a semimetal rather than a semiconductor having a very well defined band gap .",
    "however , due to the different crystal symmetry ( a7 rather than cubic ) the codes had to be significantly modified to treat sb . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the computational aspects , in particular the extensions needed for the present application .",
    "we have found that the lagrangian formulation of the dynamics problem is very helpful not only from a formal point of view but also to construct the computational equations of motion satisfying the necessary conservation laws .",
    "the lagrangian we used in our earlier study @xcite contains the following elements : + 1 ) a fully microscopic treatment for the electron dynamics using a kohn - sham ( ks ) energy functional to evolve the time - dependent electron orbitals ; + 2 ) a classical treatment of the time - dependent electric field in the crystalline unit cell ; + 3 ) a classical treatment of the dynamics of ionic centers , often called  ehrenfest dynamics \" .",
    "we write the lagrangian as a sum of three terms , the kohn - sham , electromagnetic , and ionic parts .",
    "l = l_ks + l_em+l_ion .",
    "the kohn - sham term is given the following integral over the unit cell @xmath15 , l_ks = _ i _ dr \\ { _ i^ * i _ i - ( -i + a ) _",
    "i ^2 } - _ dr \\ { ( en_ion - en_e ) -e_xc[n_e ] } .",
    "the variables here are the electron orbitals @xmath16 , the electric field potentials , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the ionic coordinates @xmath19 . the vector potential @xmath20 is a function of time without spatial dependence and describes spatially - uniform electric field , while a scalar potential @xmath17 is periodic in the unit cell .",
    "the separation of the electric field into these two components is crucial to our computational scheme @xcite .",
    "it enables us to apply bloch theorem for electron orbitals @xmath21 at each time . the ionic density @xmath22 is described with the ionic coordinates @xmath23 and the electron density @xmath24 with the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "we employ the same exchange - correlation energy functional @xmath25 $ ] for dynamical calculation as that is used for the ground state calculation .",
    "this is the well - known  adiabatic approximation \" in time - dependent density functional theory . of course",
    ", the electron dynamics in an external field can be highly non - adiabatic .",
    "the electromagnetic lagrangian is taken as l_em= _ dr ^2 + ( ) ^2 .",
    "this form is sufficient to treat the coupling in the medium at length scales small compared to the photon wave length . for the full electrodynamics including the transmission and reflection of photons from the crystal surface , the lagrangian must also include magnetic fields .",
    "this has been carried out in another context , namely the deposition of energy by strong laser pulses@xcite .",
    "we separate the vector potential @xmath18 into external field contribution @xmath26 and induced polarization @xmath27 . whether to include the induced polarization or not in @xmath18 depends on the macroscopic geometry of the sample and the polarization direction of the electric field . in the present calculation",
    ", we employ the longitudinal geometry in which the induced field is included in @xmath18 .",
    "finally , the dynamics in the ion coordinates @xmath28 is governed by the classical lagrangian , l_ion = _ m _ ( ) ^2 + _",
    "z_e a.    at a formal level , we were able to prove that the tddft dynamics reduces to the isrs formula eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the limit where the laser pulse does not deposit energy into the electronic degrees of freedom . in this adiabatic regime",
    ", the relevant dielectric properties can be calculated in perturbation theory based on static density functional theory ( dft ) , as was done in an early calculation of raman scattering in si crystals @xcite . in our full tddft calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that the theory could describe both the adiabatic isrs and the displacive mechanisms of excitations , thus providing a comprehensive framework for treating coherent laser - lattice interactions .",
    "the solver for the time - dependent kohn - sham ( ks ) equation is a key element for practical computations .",
    "our implementation of the ks solver uses a 3-dimensional real - space grid to represent the orbital wave functions @xcite .",
    "this is straightforward for molecules and other finite systems as well as extended materials with cubic crystalline symmetry such as si .",
    "however , sb has only a rhombic crystal symmetry , and the grid must be modified accordingly .",
    "fortunately , crystals such as the rhombic have a 3-fold symmetry axis , allowing the primitive hexagonal unit cell to be embedded in a supercell having the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped . the construction is shown in fig .",
    "the hexagonal face on the top of the cell is replaced by a rectangle of axes ratio @xmath29 .",
    "the cartesian periodicity needed by the ks solver can then be achieved by changing the mesh spacings in each dimension so that the supercell is spanned by an integer number of mesh points in each direction .    in the case of sb ,",
    "the crystal structure is only slightly distorted from cubic , which helps one to construct the lattice as well as to understand the character of the optical phonons .",
    "the idealized undistorted lattice is constructed from a simple cubic lattice as shown in fig .",
    "this structure can also be viewed as two interpenetrating face - centered cubic lattices , distinguished in the figure by the red and blue colors of the atoms .",
    "the @xmath30-axis of the cell goes along the @xmath31 $ ] direction of the cubes .",
    "the length of the @xmath30-axis in the undistorted geometry is @xmath32 larger than the short axis .",
    "the actual structure is now obtained by making two transformations .",
    "first , the @xmath30-axis is elongated by a factor of 1.065 .",
    "second , one of the cubes is displaced by a small amount ( 3.3% ) along the @xmath30-axis with respect to the middle of the other cubic .",
    "this displacement of the two sublattices with respect to each other define the coordinates of the optical phonons .",
    "displacements along the @xmath30-axis give rise to the @xmath2 phonon .",
    "displacements perpendicular to the @xmath30-axis give rise to the doubly - degenerate @xmath1 phonon . in a perfectly cubic system",
    "all three modes would be degenerate .",
    "the offset equilibrium position in the distorted lattice breaks the degeneracy between the frequencies of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 phonons , 4.65 thz and 3.47 thz respectively .    for our representation of sb ,",
    "the supercell contains 12 atoms and has dimensions @xmath33 with @xmath34 au .",
    "we take a mesh of @xmath35 points giving mesh spacings of @xmath36 au .",
    "the solver is described in detail in previous publications .",
    "here we just note that we use a time step of @xmath37 au , which is sufficiently small for the time evolution to be stable .",
    "typically electron orbitals are evolved for 20,000 time steps .    at each time step , the ks wave functions are calculated for a grid of @xmath38 @xmath39-points in the brillouin zone . the densities for each grid point are summed to obtain an updated ks operator for the next time step .",
    "it is convenient to parallelize the code by distributing the calculations for the @xmath39-points to different processors .     idealized cubic unit cell illustrating the embedding of the orthorhombic unit cell onto the rectangular supercell .",

    "the red and blue atoms define interpenetrating face - centered lattices .",
    "the @xmath30-axis is slightly enlongated to obtain the actual rhombic lattice .",
    "in addition , there is a small shift of the red with respect to the blue sublattice along the @xmath30-axis . ]",
    "the ionic motion is very small during the time of passage of the pump pulse , and we do nt attempt to solve newton s equations directly within the time - dependent evolution of the system . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the code only calculates the force on the ions . this is later decomposed a transient part and a constant part in the final state for the final analysis .",
    "the energy functional in our calculations treats explicitly the 5 electrons in the @xmath40 atomic orbitals .",
    "the interaction with the ionic cores is taken as the troullier - martins @xcite pseudopotential with the range of the nonlocality of 4.0 au .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is treated in the local density approximation using the standard parameterization @xcite .",
    "the group v elements , as , sb , and bi , have a complicated band structure due their rhombohedral a7 crystalline symmetry .",
    "they are distinguished by a small but nonzero overlap between nominally valence and conduction bands .",
    "this gives the crystal the characteristics of a semimetal , namely a conductor with a very small carrier density .",
    "there are several dft calculations of the electronic structure which reproduce this important feature@xcite .",
    "for example , the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite found a carrier density of @xmath41 electrons per atom in sb compared to the experimental value of @xmath42 .",
    "our dft calculation gives a similar density of electron states and a carrier density of @xmath43 electrons per atom .",
    "in any case , details of the density of states within a few tenths of ev of the fermi level should not be crucial to the dynamics at the much higher energy of the laser photon .    beyond the static electronic structure , it is important to establish the accuracy of the linear response predictions if the dynamic electronic properties are the object of the calculations .",
    "there do not seem to be any dft calculations of the dielectric properties in the literature , so we describe our results in some detail in the appendix . unfortunately , our predicted dielectric properties do not agree well with the evaluated measurements @xcite .",
    "however , the evaluated dielectric function is derived from the measured reflectivity function which seems to depend significantly on temperature . in fact",
    "our predicted reflectivity agrees fairly well with the data at 77k but not with room temperature data . since that experimental finding seems not to be understood up to now , we can not draw any strong conclusions about the origin of the disagreement with theory . in any case ,",
    "our tddft results can be compared with the simple models to evaluate the reliability of the approximations made in the models .      in this section",
