    "throughout the paper , by _ covering _ of a banach space @xmath0 we mean a family @xmath1 of proper subsets of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 any set of indices ) such that @xmath3 . by _ body _ in @xmath0 , we mean a nonempty proper subset of @xmath0 that is contained in the closure of its connected interior .",
    "a covering of @xmath0 is called a _ tiling _ of @xmath0 whenever its members ( _ tiles _ ) are closed bodies with pairwise disjoint interiors . a covering @xmath4 of @xmath0",
    "is said to be _ point - finite _ if no point of @xmath0 belongs to infinitely many members of @xmath4 ; the ( possibly infinite ) _ order _ of @xmath4 is the supremum of those @xmath5 in @xmath6 such that there exist @xmath5 members of @xmath4 with a common point .",
    "a covering @xmath4 of @xmath0 is said to be _ locally finite _ if every point in @xmath0 has a neighborhood that meets only finitely many members of @xmath4 ( equivalently , if every compact subset of @xmath0 meets only finitely many members of @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is easy to produce examples of point - finite coverings ( even by convex bodies , even tilings ) that are not locally finite : for an exhaustive discussion of this topic in the general setting of spaces of any dimension see the nice paper @xcite by v. klee ; see also @xcite and @xcite .    a great contribution to the study of coverings of infinite - dimensional banach spaces",
    "was given in 1961 by h. h. corson in his classical paper @xcite , motivated by topological reasons .",
    "the main result of that paper states that , if a banach space @xmath0 contains some infinite - dimensional reflexive subspace , then @xmath0 admits no locally finite covering by bounded convex sets . such a result has been recently improved in several directions by v. p. fonf and the second author .",
    "in fact in @xcite it is proved that , if every compact subset of @xmath0 meets only finitely many members of some covering of @xmath0 by bounded @xmath7-closed subsets , then @xmath0 is @xmath8-saturated . moreover , in order that there exist a ( algebraically ) finite - dimensional compact set that meets infinitely many members of any covering @xmath4 of @xmath0 by closed convex bounded ( in short ccb ) sets , it is enough for @xmath0 to contain an infinite - dimensional separable dual space ( see @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "in this case even a segment exists that meets infinitely many members of @xmath4 whenever the members of @xmath4 are ccb rotund or smooth bodies ( see @xcite ) , or simply ccb bodies if @xmath4 is a tiling and @xmath0 itself is ( infinite - dimensional ) reflexive ( see @xcite ) .    despite these results ,",
    "an interesting question asked by corson in @xcite still remains unanswered . after proving his theorem",
    ", he essentially asks whether some infinite - dimensional reflexive space exists that admits a point - finite covering by ccb bodies .",
    "note that , without any assumption on the infinite - dimensional banach space @xmath0 , even locally finite tilings by ccb bodies can be exhibited , like the `` lattice '' tiling of @xmath8 by suitable translates of the unit ball ( see @xcite for a significant characterization of the separable banach spaces admitting such tilings as those being isomorphically polyhedral ) .",
    "moreover , in special non - separable spaces even ( not locally finite ) tilings of order 1 can be found by ccb bodies : see the surprising construction given by v. klee in @xcite of a tiling of @xmath9 for suitable @xmath10 by pairwise disjoint translates of the closed unit ball .",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer corson s question in the affirmative .",
    "in fact we prove the following    * theorem *  _ every banach space @xmath0 admits a tiling of order 2 by closed convex bounded bodies . _",
    "our proof is obtained by combining in a suitable way two main ideas .",
    "the first one allowed v. p. fonf , a. pezzotta and the second author to prove in @xcite that any banach space can be tiled by ccb bodies . via the second one ,",
    "a. h. stone constructed in @xcite a tiling of order 2 of @xmath11 , @xmath5 any natural number , by ccb bodies .    throughout the paper we use standard geometry of banach spaces notation as in @xcite .",
    "all the banach spaces under consideration are assumed to be real .",
    "for finite - dimensional spaces a construction can be found in @xcite ( the bodies produced there are also uniformly bounded ) , so we can work only in the infinite - dimensional setting .",
    "@xmath0 is a subset of @xmath17 which is @xmath15norming for some @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 is the smallest cardinal number @xmath20 such that there exists a norming set @xmath21 for @xmath0 with @xmath22 .",
    "* step 1 *  let us begin producing a special covering @xmath27 by pairwise disjoint convex bounded bodies of @xmath28 , @xmath10 any infinite set . given any family @xmath29\\ } _ { \\nu \\in \\gamma } $ ] of bounded closed non trivial real intervals indexed on @xmath10 with @xmath30 , we say that the ccb body        following stone ( see @xcite ) , if in ( [ box ] ) exactly for one value of @xmath33 the closed interval @xmath34 $ ] is replaced by the left - open interval @xmath35 $ ] , we say that the corresponding set @xmath36 is a  lidless box \" .",
    "our construction of @xmath27 is totally inspired by the work that was already done in proving proposition 1.6 in @xcite . practically , we repeat that construction just replacing boxes by lidless boxes .",
    "it is worthwhile to present it again , since it will be used in step 2 and some more work on it will be done in step 3 .",
    "a picture giving an idea of how the construction works can be found in that paper .",
    "the collection @xmath42 covers @xmath43 and its members are pairwise disjoint .",
    "in fact , trivially any point in @xmath44 belongs to no member of @xmath27 different from @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath46 with @xmath47 and          * step 2 *  let us show how the covering @xmath27 that we have built in step 1 plays a crucial role in providing a covering @xmath59 by pairwise disjoint convex bounded bodies for any banach space .",
    "we need to recall here under the chief headings what has been done in @xcite , sect .",
    "2 , where detailed proofs are available .          let @xmath21 be a norming set for @xmath0 with @xmath63 ; passing to the equivalent norm @xmath64 , we may assume that @xmath21 is @xmath65norming . with the aid of zorn s lemma , for some ordinal @xmath66 with @xmath67 we construct a totally ordered set of pairs @xmath68 ( which , in some sense , apes a biorthogonal system ) such that                now , let us consider the covering @xmath27 of @xmath43 that has been constructed in step 1 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath80 has nonempty interior relative to @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , it can be easily seen ( see @xcite ) that , for fixed @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the point @xmath84 is an interior point of @xmath85 , so it is an interior point of @xmath86 relative to @xmath81 too .",
    "* step 3 *   following a. h. stone ( see @xcite ) , we now produce a refinement @xmath90 of @xmath27 of order 2 , that turns out to be a tiling of @xmath43 by ccb bodies . to do that , it is enough to express each lidless box @xmath91 as a countable union of boxes , in such a way that any point of @xmath92 belongs to at most two of them .",
    "* step 4 *  finally , we have only to follow the same procedure used in step 2 , just replacing @xmath27 by @xmath103 when defining the isomorphic embedding @xmath104 .",
    "it remains only to prove that , for any value of @xmath105 , also the ccb body @xmath106 has nonempty interior relative to @xmath81 .",
    "this is clear for @xmath107 . for @xmath108 , it is easy to show that the segment @xmath36 of @xmath81 , having the origin and @xmath109 as its endpoints , meets the interior of @xmath110 relative to @xmath81 .",
    "in fact set              * remark *   clearly our construction can not lead anyway to a tiling @xmath4 uniformly bounded from above or from below , i.e. we can not get that the members of @xmath4 are uniformly bounded or that there exists some positive @xmath118 such that all of them contain some ball of radius @xmath118 .",
    "so , while the choice of coefficients @xmath119 in @xcite was suggested by the possibility to get all members of @xmath4 uniformly bounded from below , in our step 1 it has been made just in order to refer quickly to that paper for those proofs that have been omitted here . it is worthwhile to notice that in @xcite ( prop .",
    "2.8 ) it is suggested the way to obtain , in any banach space with the radon - nykodym property , a tiling uniformly bounded from above just applying a cutting procedure to each member of a given tiling in a straightforward transfinite way .",
    "this can obviously be done on the members of our tiling @xmath4 .",
    "after that , to each slice that we have obtained , we can apply a new cutting procedure as described in step 3 , just referred to the linear continuous functional we used to produce the slice .",
