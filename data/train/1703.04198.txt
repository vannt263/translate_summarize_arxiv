    "the study of the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions on domains in @xmath2 is a deep and classical branch of complex analysis .",
    "one of the most natural problems in this context is to relate the properties of a function at a boundary point to those of its derivatives close to that point . in this paper , we address such questions for certain rational functions in two complex variables having additional algebraic structure .",
    "as we shall see , these investigations involve a rich and fascinating interplay betwen function theory , harmonic analysis of several complex variables , and classical algebraic geometry in the guise of algebraic curves .    in several variables ,",
    "a complicating phenomenon without counterpart in the one - variable setting manifests itself ; namely , a rational function can possess a `` non - essential singularity of the second kind , '' meaning its numerator and denominator vanish at the same point without sharing a common factor . from an analytic standpoint ,",
    "such a boundary singularity affects the boundedness , smoothness , and integrability properties of both the rational function and its derivatives in very nontrivial ways . to understand this problem further",
    ", we are led to develop a precise geometric theory of singularities of such functions using a combination of complex analysis and complex geometry .",
    "we specialize to a specific domain in @xmath3 namely the unit bidisk @xmath4 in this setting , greg knese recently initiated an impressive study of integrability and regularity properties of rational functions , see @xcite .",
    "specifically , his theory gives a method for determining if a given rational function @xmath5 is square integrable on the distinguished boundary of the bidisk @xmath6 , that is if @xmath7 .",
    "the knese integrability theory motivates the question of whether or not the derivatives of a rational function are square - integrable , or in other words , whether they belong to the hardy space @xmath8 .    for general rational functions ,",
    "such a question is very challenging .",
    "however , the arguments and methods in @xcite rest on properties of a special subset of rational functions .",
    "specifically , we say a holomorphic function @xmath9 is _ inner _ if @xmath10 for almost every @xmath11 then the subclass of _ rational inner functions _ ( rifs ) consists of inner functions @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are polynomials in two complex variables .",
    "rational inner functions on the bidisk are necessarily of the form @xmath15 where @xmath13 is a polynomial of bidegree @xmath16 with no zeros in the bidisk , @xmath17 is the reflection of @xmath13 , and @xmath18 is a unimodular constant , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5.2 ) . in",
    "what follows , we specialize to rational inner functions of the form @xmath19 , but the results for rifs with monomial factors follow easily .",
    "inner functions on the unit disk play an essential role in single - variable operator and function theory . indeed ,",
    "many hilbert space contractions are unitarily equivalent to the compression of the shift to a model space , namely a hilbert space associated to an inner function @xcite .",
    "similarly , much of analytic function theory on the disk rests on the classic beurling - lax theorem and inner - outer factorizations of one - variable hardy space functions @xcite .",
    "inner functions on the bidisk are also quite important . as in the one - variable setting , they induce interesting hilbert spaces associated to useful operators , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "although inner - outer factorization fails on the bidisk , every bounded holomorphic function on @xmath20 can still be approximated locally - uniformly by constant multiples of inner functions @xcite .",
    "rational inner functions play a particularly critical role in two - variable function theory . for example , rifs provide key examples of two - variable matrix monotone functions @xcite and provide solutions to every solvable pick interpolation problem on the bidisk @xcite",
    ". moreover rifs and their denominators , called _ stable polynomials _ , have close connections to applications in systems and control engineering , electrical engineering , and statistical mechanics ; see @xcite and the references cited within those papers .      because of their critical role in function theory on the bidisk and their particularly nice formulas , we restrict attention to rifs .",
    "specifically , in this paper , we will address two integrability questions related to rational inner functions and their derivatives .",
    "first recall that a holomorphic function @xmath21 on the bidisk belongs to the _ hardy space _",
    "@xmath22 for @xmath23 if @xmath24 here , @xmath25 , denotes lebesgue measure on @xmath26 .",
    "the space @xmath27 is the banach algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the bidisk .",
    "see @xcite for the basic theory of @xmath0-spaces on polydisks .",
    "since rifs are bounded , they immediately belong to every @xmath22 for @xmath28 we can now pose the following question .",
    "[ q1 ] if @xmath29 is a rational inner function on @xmath20 , under what conditions is @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ?    in the unit disk @xmath33",
    "analogous and more general forms of question [ q1 ] have been considered in numerous publications going back to work of ahern and clark @xcite ; see for instance @xcite and the references therein for subsequent developments . in higher dimensions ,",
    "see @xcite , it is known that an inner function on the unit ball @xmath34 whose gradient is in @xmath35 must be constant . furthermore , a number of authors have examined the related question of boundary regularity of bounded holomorphic functions on @xmath20 , see @xcite and the references provided there .",
    "however as far as the authors are aware , question [ q1 ] has been open in the setting of the bidisk . to answer this question ,",
    "we study the geometry of boundary singularities of rational inner functions and characterize derivative @xmath0-inclusion in terms of how the rif s zero set makes contact with @xmath36    we are also interested in the integrability of higher derivatives , in particular the mixed partials @xmath37 .",
    "one reason for this is that weighted area integrability of mixed partials is an equivalent condition for membership in _ dirichlet - type spaces _ @xmath38 .",
    "these are spaces of functions @xmath39 that are holomorphic in the bidisk and satisfy , for @xmath40 fixed , the norm boundedness condition @xmath41 note that @xmath42 coincides with the hardy space @xmath43 , while @xmath44 is the _ bergman space _",
    "@xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the _ dirichlet space _ of the bidisk",
    ". we will refer to the spaces @xmath38 as _ weighted dirichlet spaces _ when we wish to emphasize that we are considering parameters @xmath47 .",
    "dirichlet - type spaces are important for several reasons .",
    "the unweighted dirichlet norm leads to a hilbert function space invariant under the action of automorphisms of the underlying domain @xcite , dirichlet - type spaces are connected with potential theory through the exceptional sets of their elements @xcite , and these spaces provide a natural setting for multivariate operator theory in the form of shift operators @xcite .",
    "a characterization of cyclic polynomials for shifts acting on @xmath38 spaces was obtained in a recent series of papers @xcite , but the contents and structures of dirichlet spaces on the bidisk remain somewhat obscure .",
    "this leads to the following natural question :    [ q2 ] if @xmath29 is a rational inner function on @xmath20 , under what conditions is @xmath48 for @xmath49 ?",
    "one can easily identify some rational inner functions that belong to all @xmath38 and whose derivatives are in @xmath22 for every @xmath50 .",
    "the prime examples are    * monomials @xmath51 , @xmath52 , * finite blaschke products in one variable and products of such functions , * rational inner functions that are continuous on the closed bidisk , such as @xmath53    these examples illustrate the fact that rifs can be thought of as generalizations of finite blaschke products . since finite blaschke products",
    "are smooth on the closed unit disk they are trivially integrable along with their derivatives .",
    "questions [ q1 ] and [ q2 ] become interesting when we consider rational inner functions with singularities such as @xmath54 this function can not be continuously extended to a neighborhood of the point @xmath55 , yet remains bounded due to the simultaneous vanishing of its numerator and denominator .",
    "the results we obtain in this paper , when applied to this @xmath29 , show that the partial derivatives @xmath56 precisely when @xmath57 and @xmath48 precisely when @xmath58 different rifs will have different @xmath59 and @xmath60 intervals ; the exact cut - off points will depend in a subtle way on the geometric nature of the function s boundary singularities .",
    "we now present the structure of our paper and summarize our main results .",
    "first in section [ sec : prelim ] , we collect information about rifs on the bidisk and their counterparts , called _ rational inner pick functions _ , on the bi - upper half plane .",
    "in particular , we review key functional decompositions on the bidisk called _ agler decompositions _ and useful formulas on the bi - upper half plane called _ nevanlinna representations_. both types of formulas stem from agler model theory , which originated in @xcite and has been further developed in many recent papers including @xcite .",
    "we also review some standard ways to measure non - tangential regularity at points on the distinguished boundary @xmath26 .",
    "one theme of our paper is the usefulness of agler model theory and its related formulas in understanding the singularities and associated boundary behavior of rifs .",
    "agler model theory actually fails for general rational inner functions on the polydisk @xmath61 for @xmath62 , see @xcite , which is why we restrict our analysis to @xmath20 .    in section [ sec :",
    "contact ] , we review some important results from the theory of algebraic curves , including a geometric version of puiseux s theorem .",
    "we use these to define the contact order of a rif ; this is the essential new object in our paper and provides a measurement of how singular a rif is at points on @xmath63 . intuitively speaking",
    ", the contact order of a rif measures the rate at which its zero set tends to @xmath26 along one of the coordinate directions .",
    "specifically , denote the zero set of our rational inner function @xmath29 by @xmath64 and define the facial varieties @xmath65 then the @xmath66-_contact order of @xmath29 _ is the maximum number @xmath67 such that there exists a sequence @xmath68 converging to a singular point @xmath69 of @xmath29 and a positive constant @xmath70 such that @xmath71 if @xmath29 is continuous on @xmath72 , its @xmath73- and @xmath74-contact orders are defined to be zero .",
    "some work , detailed in theorem [ lem : contact ] , is required to show that the contact orders of a rif are well defined .",
    "in sections [ sec : dcontact]-[sec : reg ] , we study the @xmath0-membership of rif derivatives , in essence giving a complete answer to question [ q1 ] .",
    "our first characterization rests on the geometry of the zero set of @xmath29 via contact order :    let @xmath75 be a rational inner function on @xmath20 .",
    "then for @xmath76 , @xmath77 if and only if the @xmath66-contact order of @xmath29 , denoted @xmath67 , satisfies @xmath78    we then prove in theorem [ thm : hp ] that no rational inner function with singularities on @xmath26 belongs to @xmath22 for @xmath79 , a result which is sharp by the example in .",
    "then in a short section , we show that agler decompositions can also be used to establish the non - integrability of rif derivatives in the hilbert space setting . finally , section [ sec : reg ] details the surprising and counterintuitive observation that imposing higher non - tangential regularity on a rif at a singularity ( called being a @xmath80 point ) decreases the range of exponents for which @xmath81 :    let @xmath75 be a rational inner function on @xmath20 with a singularity at @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 is a @xmath80 point of @xmath29 , then at least one of @xmath84 and @xmath85 fails to belong to @xmath22 for @xmath86    this is a corollary of theorem [ thm : bj ] , which characterizes non - tangential regularity via contact order .",
    "importantly , we also derive several results from this @xmath0-theory that give statements purely about the geometry of a rif s singularities ; for example , corollary [ cor : geojulia ] , which is a geometric julia inequality of the same flavor as results in @xcite , says that the @xmath73- and @xmath74-contact orders of a singular rif are both at least @xmath87 .",
    "sections [ sec : dirichlet]-[sec : dincl ] are concerned with rif membership in dirichlet - type spaces . in section [ sec : dirichlet ] , we review preliminary information about the structure of dirichlet - type spaces .",
    "then in theorem [ thm : dp ] , we provide a partial answer to question [ q2 ] by showing how membership in @xmath38 for a certain range of exponents @xmath60 can be deduced from @xmath0-integrability , again via contact order .",
    "specifically ,    [ [ cor : da ] ] let @xmath75 be a rational inner function on @xmath20 . then for @xmath88 ,",
    "if @xmath89 and @xmath90 , then @xmath91 .",
    "this result follows from the more general theorem [ thm : dp ] , which is stated for anisotropic dirichlet spaces . then by combining agler decompositions with a two - variable version of the local dirichlet integrals of richter and sundberg , we are able to prove in theorem [ thm:1d ] that members of a restricted class of rifs fail to be in @xmath92 , the dirichlet space of the bidisk .",
    "finally , section [ sec : dincl ] gives some simple sufficient conditions for placing a rif in @xmath38 .",
    "section [ sect : examples ] provides a detailed treatment of several explicit rifs to illustrate our results , and the paper closes with a discussion of possible avenues for further research .",
    "let @xmath29 be a rational inner function on @xmath94 . then @xmath95 where @xmath13 is a polynomial of degree @xmath16 with no zeros in the bidisk , @xmath17 is the reflection of @xmath13 , and @xmath18 is a unimodular constant .",
    "we can further assume that @xmath13 is atoral and hence , has finitely many zeros on @xmath63 .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "one can further deduce that @xmath13 has no zeros on @xmath96 since @xmath29 can only have singularities at the zeros of @xmath13 , it will only have finitely many singularities on @xmath97    in what follows , we study the @xmath98 and the @xmath99 membership of rational inner functions and the geometry of their singularities .",
    "these properties are not affected by the existence ( or nonexistence ) of a monomial factor @xmath100 .",
    "thus , in the remainder of the paper , we prove statements about rational inner functions of the form @xmath75 , where @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath13 and @xmath102 share no common factors ( as @xmath13 is atoral ) , we will also say @xmath103 . the corresponding results for general rational inner functions will follow immediately from our results about @xmath19 rational inner functions .",
    "let @xmath104 denote the upper half plane .",
    "then a two - variable _ pick function _ is a holomorphic function that maps @xmath93 into @xmath104 . a pick function",
    "is called _ inner _ if @xmath105 for almost every @xmath106 .",
    "we will move between @xmath104 and @xmath107 via the following useful conformal maps : @xmath108 ;   \\quad & & \\widetilde{\\alpha}\\colon   \\mathbb{d } \\rightarrow \\pi , \\",
    "\\widetilde{\\alpha}(z ) : = i \\left [ \\frac{1-z}{1+z } \\right ] ; \\\\ & \\beta\\colon \\pi \\rightarrow \\mathbb{d } , \\ \\beta(w):=\\frac{w - i}{w+i};\\quad & & \\tilde{\\beta}\\colon \\pi \\rightarrow \\mathbb{d } , \\",

    "if @xmath29 is a rational inner function on @xmath20 , then we can use these maps to transform @xmath29 into a rational inner pick function @xmath21 on @xmath93 as follows : @xmath111,\\ ] ] where @xmath112 if @xmath113 are the singular points of @xmath29 on @xmath26 , then on @xmath114 , @xmath21 only has singularities at the points @xmath115 and on the set @xmath116 moreover , it is easy to see that on @xmath117 the function @xmath21 is continuous as a map into @xmath118    sometimes it is convenient to work directly with @xmath29 , but other times , it will be convenient to work with @xmath21 via .",
    "heuristically , @xmath21 has the advantage that the boundary is flat and the range space is a cone , and @xmath29 has the advantage that the boundary is compact and the range space is closed under multiplication .",
    "every rational inner function @xmath119 with @xmath101 possesses a pair of _ agler kernels _ , namely a pair of positive semidefinite kernels @xmath120 satisfying @xmath121 then is called an _ agler decomposition of @xmath29_. these can be obtained from sums of squares of polynomials . by (",

    "moreover , as @xmath133 and @xmath134 satisfy additional term and degree bounds , see the beginning of section @xmath135 in @xcite , we can expand these kernels and write @xmath136 for polynomials @xmath137 with @xmath138 and polynomials @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",

    "we also require the following ( likely well - known ) lemma :    [ lem : bpoint ] if @xmath29 is a rational inner function on @xmath20 , then every @xmath82 is a @xmath153-point for @xmath154    let @xmath155",

    "technically the statement of theorem @xmath174 in @xcite does not include the fact that @xmath176 is finite dimensional .",

    "<S> we derive inclusion results for dirichlet - type spaces from derivative inclusion for @xmath0 . using agler decompositions and local dirichlet integrals </S>",
    "<S> , we further prove that a restricted class of rational inner functions fails to belong to the unweighted dirichlet space . </S>"
