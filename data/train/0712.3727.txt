    "the pierre auger observatory will be completed in early 2008 and will consist of 1600 10m@xmath0 @xmath1 1.2 m water - cherenkov detectors deployed over 3000 km@xmath0 on a 1500 m hexagonal grid overlooked by four fluorescence detectors ( fd ) , each of them with 6 telescopes . the surface detector ( sd ) stations sample at the ground level the charged particles in the shower front that cross the stations .",
    "the fluorescence telescopes can record the ultraviolet light emitted as the shower crosses the atmosphere . by september of 2007 about 90% of the sd detector and all 24 fd telescopes were operational .",
    "the accumulated exposure international cosmic ray conference , in mrida , mexico , july , 2007 . ] up to 28 february 2007 was 5165 km@xmath0  sr  yr , about the same as the monocular hires and three times larger then agasa @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory was designed as a hybrid detector , i.e. , to use both fluorescence and ground array techniques in a extensive way . about 10% of the events",
    "are detected simultaneously by both techniques . from them",
    "two variables can be measured : the ground parameter @xmath2 and the energy as measured by the fluorescence detector .",
    "the correlation of the two variables is shown in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] left .",
    "the dispersion is shown in the right .    with this calibration the energy of the showers that are detected by the sd only ( tenfold more statistics )",
    "can be estimated in a empirical  way  @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ f-2 ] left , the energy spectrum multiplied by @xmath3 from sd data using showers at zenith angle above and below 60@xmath4 , together with the spectrum obtained from the hybrid data set are shown . the three spectra obtained using different methods agree well and a combined fit is performed . only statistical errors are quoted .",
    "a flattening of the slope of the energy spectrum from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is observed at @xmath7 ev and above @xmath8 ev the spectrum gets steeper , with slope @xmath9 .",
    "the number of events expected if the power - law observed at @xmath7 ev were extended above @xmath8 ev and @xmath10 ev are @xmath11 and @xmath12 whereas we observe only 58 events and 2 events , respectively @xcite .",
    "so a sharp suppression in the last decade of the uhecr spectrum is observed ( as it was already shown by the hires experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "whether this is due to the expected gzk cuttoff or if it is due to other phenomena like a limit on the acceleration process , is an open question and needs further investigation .",
    "the `` ankle '' is determined to be at @xmath13 ev .",
    "the depth of shower maximum depends on the primary mass and comparisons with monte carlo models can be made to extract information about the mass composition of the uhecr .",
    "hybrid events allow the measurement of @xmath14 and have the geometry of the shower well constrained by the sd information .",
    "the data is shown in figure [ f-2 ] right .",
    "after appropriate quality and uniformity cuts , the @xmath14 resolution is less than 40 g / cm@xmath0 .",
    "a single slope does not seem to fit the data and the rate of increase of @xmath14 with energy is smaller for the region above @xmath16 ev than below .",
    "more data will be necessary to establish the tendency to heavier composition at high energies .",
    "primary photon showers are easier to distinguish from primary hadron showers , since they penetrate deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "this results in a larger rise time of the signal produced in the sd stations and in a smaller radius of curvature of the shower front .",
    "those two variables can be measured precisely in the surface detector and are combined in one single variable through a principal component analysis .",
    "no event up to now was identified with a photon .",
    "the absence ( or very small fraction ) of photons in the incident primary cosmic ray flux allows stringent photon limits to be set up .",
    "for instance , at 10 eev the upper limit @xcite in the integral flux fraction produced by primary photons is about 2% .",
    "this sets constraints to _ top - down models _ , where the uhecr are the decay products of heavy primordial particles or produced by topological defects .",
    "one of the major aims for the experiment is the measurement of the anisotropy of the arrival direction of the uhecr .",
    "one expects that protons with energy of about 50 eev or higher to deviate two or three degrees in the galactic magnetic field . in order to calculate the significance of the results in a unbiased way , an _ a priori _ specification of the details of the analysis to be done with _ future _ data is required .",
    "any hint of a discovery found in a exploratory analysis will be subjected to a _",
    "prescription _ that requires new data .",
    "previous claims of anisotropy from the galactic center and of clustering at high energies , as well as correlation with bl - lacs were not confirmed by auger@xcite .",
    "there are enhancements already approved and funded for the south observatory .",
    "heat will reduce the energy threshold down to 0.1 eev and amiga will detect showers down to 0.1 eev and measure their muon content @xcite . this will allow precise measurements of the shower composition in the `` ankle '' region and constrain hadronic models in this energy range .",
    "the north observatory , planned to be built in colorado , usa , possibly with a higher threshold in the detector energy , will provide full sky coverage with enhanced statistics at the end of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
