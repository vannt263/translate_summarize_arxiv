    "our purpose is to provide a description of the semileptonic decays of the tau lepton that incorporates as many theoretical restrictions derived from the fundamental interaction , @xmath0 @xcite , as possible .",
    "this is a very convenient scenario to investigate the hadronization of @xmath0 because one fermionic current is purely leptonic and thus calculable unambiguously so that we can concentrate our efforts on the other one , involving light quarks coupled to a @xmath3 current .",
    "+ the decay amplitude for the considered decays may be written as : @xmath4 where the strong interacting part is encoded in the hadronic vector , @xmath5 : @xmath6 symmetries let us decompose @xmath5 depending on the number of final - state pseudoscalar ( @xmath7 ) mesons , @xmath8 .",
    "+ one meson tau decays can be predicted in terms of the measured processes @xmath9 , since the matrix elements are related .",
    "this provides a precise test of charged current universality @xcite . on the other side",
    ", it can not tell anything new on hadronization . + the two - pion tau decay is conventionally parameterized -in the isospin limit , that we always assume- just in terms of the vector ( @xmath10 ) form factor of the pion , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "+ because @xmath14 is broken appreciably by the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , two form factors are needed to describe the decays involving one pion and one kaon : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 carries quantum numbers @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the pseudoscalar form factor ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "other two meson decays can be treated similarly and one should take advantage of the fact that chiral symmetry relates some of their matrix elements .",
    "+ for three mesons in the final state , the most general decomposition reads : @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 , correspond to the axial - vector current ( @xmath27 ) while @xmath28 drives the vector current ( @xmath29 ) . the form factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 have a transverse structure in the total hadron momenta , @xmath32 , and drive a @xmath33 transition . the pseudoscalar form factor , @xmath34 , vanishes as @xmath35 and , accordingly , gives a tiny contribution .",
    "higher - multiplicity modes can be described proceeding similarly @xcite .",
    "this is as far as we can go without model assumptions , that is , it is not yet known how to obtain the @xmath25 from @xmath0 .",
    "however , one can derive some of their properties from the underlying theory , as we will explain in the following .",
    "we use a phenomenological lagrangian @xcite written in terms of the relevant degrees of freedom that become active through the energy interval spanned by hadronic tau decays .",
    "the chiral symmetry of massless @xmath0 determines @xcite the chiral invariant operators that can be written including the lightest mesons in the spectrum , the pseudoscalar ones belonging to the pion multiplet .",
    "it was carefully checked @xcite that -as one expects- chiral perturbation theory , @xmath36 , can only describe a little very - low - energy part of semileptonic tau decays .",
    "+ then one may attempt to extend the range of applicability of @xmath36 to higher energies while keeping its predictions for the form factors at low momentum : this is the purpose of resonance chiral theory , @xmath37 , @xcite that includes the light - flavoured resonances as explicit fields in the action .",
    "+ at @xmath38 in the @xmath39 limit of @xmath0 @xcite one has as infinite tower of stable mesons that experience local effective interactions at tree level .",
    "we depart from this picture in two ways :    * we incorporate the widths of the resonances worked out consistently within @xmath40 @xcite . *",
    "we attempt a description including the least possible number of resonance fields reducing -ideally- to the single resonance approximation , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we take vector meson dominance into account when writing our lagrangian .",
    "thus , it will consist of terms accounting for the following interactions ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 stand for the axial(-vector ) currents and @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the axial(-vector ) resonances ) :    * those in @xmath36 at @xmath38 and @xmath36-like : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 with even - intrinsic parity ; and @xmath49 in the odd - intrinsic parity sector . * those relevant in @xmath40 -@xmath50 @xmath36 operators are not included to avoid double counting , since they are recovered and their couplings are saturated upon integration of the resonance contributions @xcite- .",
    "they include : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the even - intrinsic parity sector and @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the odd - parity one .",
    "the explicit form of the operators and the naming for the couplings can be read from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ the @xmath40 just determined by symmetries does not share the @xmath59 @xmath0 behaviour yet . for this , and for our purposes , we need to impose appropriate brodsky - lepage conditions @xcite on the relevant form factors .",
    "explicit computation and these short - distance restrictions reduce appreciably the number of independent couplings entering the amplitudes which enables us to end up with a useful -that is , predictive- theory .",
    "our framework describes pretty well the two - meson decays of the @xmath2 , as shown in the @xmath60 @xcite and @xmath61 @xcite cases .",
    "two - meson modes including @xmath62 can be worked analogously .",
    "the data in these modes are so precise that although the @xmath41 describes the gross features of the data , one needs to include the first excitations of the @xmath45 resonances to achieve an accurate description .",
    "although @xmath19 is much more important than @xmath21 , one needs an appropriate pseudoscalar form factor to fit well the data , specially close to threshold @xcite .",
    "+ the three meson modes are much more involved .",
    "however , a good description of the data has been achieved through a careful study @xcite taking into account all theory constrains and experimental data on the @xmath63 and @xmath64 channels .",
    "we predict the @xmath64 spectral function and conclude that the vector current contribution can not be neglected in these modes .",
    "we will study the other three meson modes along the same lines .",
    "in particular , our study of the @xmath65 channels might help improve the simultaneous extraction of @xmath15 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "our expressions for the vector and axial - vector widths and the hadronic matrix elements have been implemented successfully in the tauola library @xcite .",
    "this way , the experimental comunity will have as its disposal a way of analysing hadronic decays of the tau that includes as much as possible information from the fundamental theory",
    ". we also plan to study @xmath67 at low energies what can eventually be used by @xcite .",
    "i congratulate the local organizing committee for this first edition of the young researchers workshop as well as for the xiv lnf spring school bruno touschek held in parallel .",
    "i am grateful to jorge portols for a careful revision and useful suggestions on the draft .",
    "i acknowledge useful discussions with olga shekhovtsova . this work has been supported in part by the eu mrtn - ct-2006 - 035482 ( flavianet ) and by the dfg cluster of excellence origin and structure of the universe .",
