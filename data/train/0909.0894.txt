    "the interpretation of x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) at the cu k - edge in high - t@xmath0 cuprates , and especially of the pre - edge features , remains a challenging issue due to the strongly correlated nature of these materials .",
    "understanding the nature of the pre - edge features is relevant since these excitations are low in energy and probe the local environment of the absorbing atom .",
    "in several recent works @xcite the presence of off - site excitations in transition metal compounds like nio , cuprates and cobaltates was demonstrated .",
    "off - site excitations can occur by a direct transition of a 1s core electron to empty electronic states of the nearest neighboring atoms @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has a low intensity ( @xmath3 of the edge jump ) since the p - states of the absorbing atoms are not involved .",
    "more frequently the off - site excitations are mediated by the on - site p - states of the absorbing atom that are very extended and therefore hybridize with neighboring sites . when excitations due to intersite cu ( absorbing atom ) 4p - cu ( other atom ) 3d hybridization occur , the information is very relevant since these features are typically weakly affected by core - hole attraction and thus they probe the excitation in the absence of a core - hole in the final state . in some cases",
    "off - site transitions can be used to measure the charge transfer gap , as was recently suggested for nio @xcite .",
    "therefore , a full understanding of pre - edge features and of their possible non - local nature leads to the knowledge of the hybridization mechanism between different orbitals in the low energy region ( up to some ev from the fermi level ) and of the position of the upper hubbard band in the absence of a core - hole in the final state @xcite .    in the case of high t@xmath0 cuprates , and of correlated materials in general ,",
    "the occurrence of many - body charge transfer excitations in the edge region has been widely debated @xcite .",
    "recently , using first principles calculations , we suggested @xcite that edge and far - edge structures previously attributed to charge transfer effects were actually single particle in origin .",
    "thus most of the multi - determinant effects seen in photoemission seem to be suppressed in absorption , probably by the presence of a final - state in the xas cross - section .",

    "these materials form a new family of high tc superconductors with a critical temperature peaking at 43 k at optimal nominal doping level ( after post - annealing ) .",
    "the oxychlorides are appropriate for investigating the electronic properties of the cuo@xmath2 plane .",
    "they are , for example , well suited for calculations because of lesser structural disorder and the absence of rare earth atoms . they also present peculiar features compared to the cuprates such as a checker - board pattern of charge inhomogeneities  @xcite at odds with the stripes in the cuprates .",
    "high resolution xas allows us to identify new pre - edge electronic excitations and a doubling of the main edge that are not visible in previous xas measurements in high t@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "importantly we find that most of these excitations are single particle in nature . after identifying the single particle excitations and addressing the role of many - body charge - transfer effects in the xas spectra ,",
    "we come to the conclusion that the interpretation of cu k - edge xas in cuprates should be revisited .",
    "section [ sec : tech_det ] presents the experimental and theoretical details , and draws a comparison between the measured pfy - xas spectra of ca@xmath4cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 and of la@xmath2cuo@xmath5 . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we confront the experimental data with the calculated cross section and identify the single particle peaks using the projected density of states on selected electronic states in the presence of a core - hole in the 1s state .",
    "finally we discuss the relevance of our results for the understanding of the empty state electronic structure in high t@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "the experiment was carried out at spring-8 on the inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) beamline bl12xu .",
    "the incident energy was selected by a si(111 ) double crystal coupled to a high - resolution four - bounce si(400 ) monochromator providing an estimated bandwidth of 220 mev .",
    "we have used well characterized superconducting single crystals of ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 ( @xmath6)@xcite . to prevent degradation of the samples known to be highly hygroscopic , the crystals were covered with a grease suitable for low temperature measurements . the superconducting temperature of 35 k measured by squid confirms that the intrinsic quality was preserved .",
    "the sample orientation was verified by x - ray diffraction prior to measurements .",
    "the absorption spectra were recorded in the partial fluorescence yield ( pfy ) mode using the beamline ixs spectrometer .",
    "the pfy - xas consists of measuring the intensity variations of the cu k@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) emission line while scanning the incident energy through the cu k - edge . with respect to conventional xas",
    ", the pfy method yields an improved intrinsic resolution as the lifetime broadening effect in the pfy final state ( with a @xmath9 core hole ) is considerably smaller than that of standard xas at the k - edge ( with a @xmath10 core hole ) .",
    "the spectrometer was equipped with a 2 m bending radius si(444 ) analyzer working at bragg angle of 79.3@xmath11 at the cu k@xmath7 energy ( 8048 ev ) and a high flux silicon drift detector .",
    "the total energy resolution was estimated at  250 mev from the width of the elastic line .",
    "the sample was mounted on a goniometer head with the @xmath12 axis ( normal to the surface ) in the horizontal plane .",
    "the pfy absorption spectra were acquired with the polarization of the incident photons set either parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath12 axis upon rotating the sample around a vertical axis .",
    "the spectra were corrected for self - absorption effect using the fluo code developed by d. haskel ( advanced photon source , argonne ) .",
    "ab initio calculations on ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 are performed using spin polarized density functional theory ( dft ) with pbe exchange - correlation @xcite .",
    "we cross - check our results with the dft+u approximation , with @xmath13 ev as used in other cuprates @xcite .",
    "the calculation are performed with the xspectra code @xcite available under the gpl licence in the quantum - espresso package @xcite .",
    "we use ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite for all atomic species . the 1s core - hole",
    "is included in the pseudopotential of the absorbing atom . for the cu pseudopotential we use non - linear core corrections @xcite and do not include semicore states .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the inclusion of the copper semicore states in the valence states is not necessary for an accurate description of xas in cuprates .",
    "for the xas calculation we use a monoclinic supercell containing one cuo plane and 14 atoms with experimental lattice parameters @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : oxy0 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic state of ca@xmath14cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 has not been yet resolved , but for simplicity we assume a collinear antiferromagnetism , similar to other cuprates .",
    "the wavefunctions are expanded on a plane wave basis with a 30 ry cutoff for the wavefunctions , and 400 ry for the charge density .",
    "a uniform monkhorst - pack 6@xmath156@xmath152 k - points grid ( with respect to the antiferromagnetric unit cell ) is used for the charge density calculation , with a methfessel - paxton smearing of 0.05 ry .",
    "the hole doping is treated by adding a compensating charge background , leading at @xmath6 to a nonmagnetic state in agreement with experiments .",

    "all d - states are filled except the 3d@xmath20 orbital which is half - empty .",
    "however , the 3d@xmath20 being planar , the quadrupolar part is forbidden in both geometries .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quadrupolar matrix element of the absorption cross section includes a term @xmath21 . in the @xmath16 geometry @xmath22 , while in the @xmath17 geometry @xmath23 .",
    "so in both experimental settings the matrix element is zero .",
    "we first focus on the pre - edge region . at 8978 ev in @xmath16 geometry an extremely small feature ( labeled a in the following ) is present",
    ", its intensity is 0.4 % of the edge jump .",
    "a similar feature is present at the same energy in the @xmath17 geometry ( labeled a ) , however the intensity in this direction is substantially larger , of the order of 3% of the edge jump .",
    "interestingly this feature in the @xmath17 geometry merges with a second broader band centered at 8982 ev ( labeled b ) .",
    "given the weakness of some of these excitations , particularly along the c - axis , we reconsider our published pfy - xas cu - k - edge la@xmath2cuo@xmath5 data to see if similar features occur @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case , however these small features ( in both geometries ) were not discussed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we have not found any xas measurements @xcite on cuprates displaying the a and a features .",
    "we also performed xas measurements on the most interesting @xmath24 direction and found that the standard xas spectrum shows a very broad tail extending down to the pre - edge region .",
    "none of the pre - edge features that are clearly resolved by pfy are visible here , as in the case of la2cuo4 .",
    "furthermore the b at 8922 ev in the @xmath25 geometry is usually assumed to be completely quadrupolar .",
    "this is due to the lesser sensitivity of standard xas data when compared with pfy measurements .    in ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2",
    "the first feature is probably not more than 0.3 ev above the fermi level and thus it is relevant for its low energy physics .",
    "the other pre - edge features at higher energies ( labeled b , b and c in fig . [ fig : oxy1 ] ) are common to those of other cuprates .",
    "the structure in the absorption edge is similar in the two systems , apart from a remarkable difference . in the case of ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 with @xmath16 geometry the edge ( peak of the whiteline ) at 8989 ev is accompanied by a distinct shoulder at 8992 ev . in ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 for @xmath17",
    "the edge seems substantially larger than the experimental resolution , suggesting the presence of a second peak in this case too . in la@xmath2cuo@xmath5",
    "there is no evidence of such a splitting .",
    "however the poorer experimental resolution we had in ref . could hinder the detection of a second peak .",
    "consequently higher resolution measurements are necessary to clarify if this splitting is a general feature of high t@xmath0 cuprates .        to understand the origin of the features seen in the absorption spectra , we carried out extensive dft calculations for ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 . in the presence of a core - hole",
    "the d@xmath20 state around the absorbing atom is the only d state partially occupied . in the pre - edge region",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that the system is metallic and it is hard to isolate the occupied states from the unoccupied ones , even as far as the dipolar part is concerned . as a consequence we have decided to shift the fermi level 0.7 ev below that found in the supercell calculation ( this is illustrated by the dashed line in figs .  [",
    "fig : oxy1],[fig : oxy2],[fig : oxy3 ] ) .",
    "this shift improves the agreement with experiments in the low - energy region .",
    "however the drawback is that a small tail of the @xmath26 projected density of states becomes unoccupied generating a quadrupolar term ( see fig.[fig : oxy3 ] ) . by direct calculation of the xas quadrupolar cross section",
    "we have verified that this quadrupolar term is completely negligible with respect to the dipolar part emerging from the fermi level downshift . despite these difficulties and the strongly correlated nature of the system which is a real challenge for density functional theory ,",
    "we find good overall agreement with experiments .    in the pre - edge region and @xmath16 geometry , we reproduce the low intensity peak a as it can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : oxy1 ] . the analysis based on the density of states projected on selected orbitals in the presence of a core - hole in the final state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oxy2 ] ) suggests that the peak is essentially due to an off - site transition to cl 2p@xmath27 states and practically negligible quadrupolar component .",
    "this is analogous to what was found in nio @xcite , namely a very low energy dipolar feature due to direct off - site transition to nearby atoms .",
    "the situation is not as favorable in the @xmath28 geometry where the broad band b and the small feature a are replaced in our calculation by a more intense broad band ( figs .",
    "[ fig : oxy1 ] and [ fig : oxy3 ] ) .",
    "this disagreement is a reminder that dft has limitations when it comes to the description of the low energy physics of high t@xmath0 compounds .    on the other hand ,",
    "the peaks c@xmath29 and d@xmath29 are correctly reproduced .",
    "the c@xmath29 peak is due to intersite hybridization between cu 4p , o 2p@xmath30 and ca d states , while the d@xmath29 peak is due to transitions to on - site cu 4p states . similarly to the c@xmath29 peak , the b peak in @xmath16 geometry is due to intersite cu 4p , ca d and cl p@xmath27 states .",
    "thus all the pre - edge peaks a b , and c are dominated by off - site transitions .",
    "this energy region has been studied in detail in the past mainly due to the work of tolentino _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and kosugi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggesting that multi - determinant excitations could occur .",
    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it was proposed that the edge peaks c and e are due to transition to @xmath31 states while their supposed sattelites , e and f are due to @xmath32 .",
    "the original proposal was on cu k - edge of la@xmath2cuo@xmath5 .",
    "however in ref .",
    "we showed that this system is not well described by dft in this region due to the difficulty in treating la f states .",
    "nevertheless we concluded in ref . @xcite",
    "that apart from a shift of the e peak to high energy , generated by an incorrect treatment of la f states in dft , c , e , e , f were most likely due to single particle excitations .",
    "the present compound is ideal to verify this conclusion since no rare - earths are present .",
    "indeed we find that peaks c , e , e , f are correctly reproduced confirming their single particle nature .    in the @xmath16 direction a peak labeled d",
    "this peak is absent from our single particle calculation .",
    "this suggests that multi - determinant charge transfer effects could indeed occur in cuprates . in order to test our conjecture",
    "one should consider the convolution between hard x - ray cu 1s photoemission data and first principles calculations .",
    "this procedure should give semi - quantitative agreement with the cu k - edge xas @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in the present case is that there are no photoemission data for this system so measurements and calculations on other correlated compounds are needed .",
    "in this work we have carried out cu k - edge pfy - xas measurements and state - of - the - art first principles calculations in high t@xmath0 cuprates ca@xmath1cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that rich structure due to dipolar transitions occurs in the pre - edge region . by performing electronic structure calculations",
    "we have shown that pre - edge peaks are dominated by off - site transitions .",
    "furthermore we have shown the occurrence of new excitations in the low energy region , at less than 0.5 ev from the fermi level . in this energy region dft calculations only partially capture the relevant physics of the system since they fail in describing the in - plane excitations .",
    "our work demonstrates the need of going beyond single site cluster models and , for what concerns correlation effects , beyond density functional theory , in order to explain cu k - edge xas of cuprates .",
    "previous work @xcite invokes a strong influence of many body effects to explain the features observed in xas k - edge spectra of high tc materials .",
    "notably the invocation of a correlated ground state and the rearrangement of the energy states due to the core hole effect has lead earlier authors to conclude that some of the most prominent peaks in xas spectra are not due to single particle excitations .",
    "this interpretation is also inspired from core - level photoemission data but here we show that the situation is not analogous and that much of the xas k - edge spectrum can in fact be explained invoking single particle excitations .",
    "further , we find that many body effects due to charge transfer do occur but in a different way from earlier interpretations .",
    "the ramifications of this reinterpretation go beyond xas spectroscopy .",
    "it will suffice to note that rixs spectra use the resonances found in xas to excite particular intermediate states .",
