    "the nature of s0 galaxies has been a matter of controversy since their appearance in the first morphological classification schemes @xcite and many authors refer to them as normal spirals stripped of their gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of s0 galaxies in clusters suggest that interactions between galaxies can lead to the loss of interstellar matter in the disk and convert spirals into s0s .",
    "other theories favour gas loss through ram - pressure stripping from the intergalactic medium @xcite or via galactic winds @xcite , or assert that s0 galaxies are primordial galaxies which have entirely consumed their gas due to a high star formation rate @xcite .",
    "when studying the formation of s0 galaxies , one is often drawn to examine the order of events during galaxy assembly .",
    "early formation models favour the formation of the bulge before the disk , which is supported by several photometric studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by the fact that s0s behave like ellipticals in the widely known scaling relations ( i.e.color-magnitude , mg@xmath1-@xmath2 or fundamental plane ) .",
    "numerical simulations raised the possibility of an alternative scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in which bulges are formed via secular evolution processes after the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although such studies naturally focus on the two major components , i.e.  the large - scale disk and the bulge , galaxies often show more structures , e.g.  central disks , stellar kinematically decoupled components ( kdcs ) and multiple gaseous components .",
    "these are commonly observed in galaxies all along the hubble sequence and are often used to emphasize the role of mergers during the formation of early - type galaxies @xcite .    in the last @xmath3 years ,",
    "evidence for the presence of kdcs in early - type galaxies ( e.g. ,  ngc4406 , @xcite ; ngc4365 , @xcite ) has usually been revealed through long - slit measurements .",
    "this can introduce a priori assumptions about the geometry of the central structures , and several works have tried to overcome this limitation by mapping the galaxies with multiple slits at different positions angles @xcite .",
    "however , the arrival of a new generation of integral - field units ( ifus ) providing contiguous field - of - views ( fovs ) , such as  ( e.g. , ngc4621 , @xcite ) or   @xcite , offers a much more efficient way to detect kdcs .",
    "early  results @xcite reveal a variety of structures much richer than usually recognized in early - type galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to use the information contained in these features to elucidate the key processes at work during galaxy formation .",
    "the galaxies concerned can become the ideal benchmarks against which to test the predictions of galaxy formation and evolution theories .",
    "ngc7332 , the galaxy studied in this paper , may be such a keystone .",
    "ngc7332 , a boxy edge - on s0 galaxy , was studied extensively in the past .",
    "the galaxy is mainly known for a bright counter - rotating and a faint co - rotating  gas component with respect to the stars @xcite .",
    "those gas structures were confirmed by @xcite , who mapped the  emission via fabry - perot observations .",
    "ngc7332 exhibits a rather regular broad - band morphology @xcite and its colours are somewhat bluer than those of elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity .",
    "spectral analysis of the central regions reveals a luminosity - weighted age of about @xmath4  gyr @xcite .    in this paper , we use  observations to characterize new and known features and improve our understanding of the morphology and dynamics of ngc7332 .",
    "we focus the analysis on the distribution and kinematics of the stellar and gaseous components , but we also discuss the corresponding  line strengths maps .",

    "the line - strength analysis is presented in section  [ sec : popu ] .",
    "we finally discuss possible formation and evolution scenarios for ngc7332 in section  [ sec : discussion ] and summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we observed ngc7332 with the integral field spectrograph  attached to the @xmath5-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos at la palma , spain , on 13 oct 1999 .",
    "we obtained @xmath6 largely overlapping exposures of @xmath7s each , producing more than @xmath8 spectra per exposure , including @xmath9 sky spectra @xmath10 away from the main field .",

    "the spatial sampling of individual exposures is performed by an array of square lenses of @xmath15 , providing a fov of @xmath16 .",
    "the seeing at the time of the observations was stable at about @xmath17 ( fwhm ) .",
    "flux , velocity and line - strength standard stars were observed during the same observing run for calibration purposes .",
    "arc lamp exposures were taken before and after each target frame for wavelength calibration .",
    "a tungsten lamp exposure was also taken at the end of the night in order to build the mask allowing us to extract the data from the ccd frames .",
    "we followed the procedures described in @xcite for the extraction , reduction , and calibration of the data , using the specifically designed xsauron software .",
    "the sky level was measured with the help of the dedicated sky lenses and subtracted from the target spectra .",
    "we merged the @xmath6 individual extracted datacubes by spatially resampling the spectra onto a common squared grid .",
    "the dithering of individual exposures ( with an original spatial sampling of @xmath18 ) enabled us to sample the merged datacube onto @xmath19 pixels .",
    "the resulting merged mosaic fov is @xmath20 with a total of @xmath21 spectra .",
    "we then binned our final datacube using the voronoi 2d binning algorithm of @xcite to create compact bins with a minimum signal - to - noise ratio @xmath22 of @xmath23 per pixel .",
    "most spectra have @xmath22 in excess of @xmath23 , however , so that most of the original spatial elements remain un - binned ( e.g. , @xmath24_{\\rm max}\\approx300 $ ] in the central lens ) .    .properties of ngc7332 [ cols=\"<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath25 from the  and  lines fitted simultaneously .",
    "+ @xmath26 within the field .",
    "+ @xmath27 central aperture [ 16 x 16 ]      ngc7332 exhibits some amount of counter - rotating ionised gas ( @xmath28 ) , which has commonly been used to argue for an external origin . in the case of ngc7332 ,",
    "the ionised gas most likely comes from a tidal interaction with the neighbouring galaxy ngc7339 .",
    "we note that extended counter - rotating ionised gas is common in s0s @xcite , and more specifically in galaxies with boxy bulges ( bureau & chung 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "although the ionised gas distribution and kinematics obtained from the datacube are complex , some of the counter - rotating gaseous component in ngc7332 seems to have a relatively ordered flow and extends relatively far from the major - axis of the galaxy .",
    "if we assume that the galaxy is sufficiently inclined , the ionised gas could trace a bar or spiral - like structure in the equatorial plane .",
    "if quasi edge - on , however , it must have a significant vertical extent .",
    "considering the orbital timescales involved ( e.g.  about @xmath29  yr for a gas clump @xmath30  kpc from the centre ) , we would naively expect the ( dissipative ) counter - rotating ionised gas to be quickly driven back to the equatorial plane .",
    "this need not be so , however , as in the tumbling potential of a bar there exists one major family of stable retrograde orbits ( the anomalous orbits ) which is tilted with respect to the equatorial plane and can reach significant heights @xcite .    despite the above ambiguity , it is safe to assume that an accretion event is at the origin of the observed counter - rotating gaseous component in ngc7332 . the same accretion event could be responsible for the formation of the central kdc revealed by  and stis , as well as the dip in the velocity dispersion profile ( see section  [ sec : crc ] ) and the increase of the mg@xmath31 and fe5270 indices at the very centre ( see section  [ sec : popu ] ) . the  index values",
    "would then setup an upper limit of about 3 - 4 gyrs ( luminosity - weighted ) for the kdc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : agemet ] ) . another later accretion event may be required to explain the more perturbed gas clumps located further away from the equatorial plane ( see section  [ sec : gkinem ] ) , which have rather high relative velocities .",
    "this gas has certainly not settled yet , but it will eventually fall back towards the equatorial plane of ngc7332 .      any formation and evolution scenario for ngc7332 must take into account the two main ingredients hinted at from the observations described in this paper : the presence of a bar and a recent interaction event .",
    "we now examine them in turn .      in our view ,",
    "the main morphological and kinematic features that we associate with the bar in section  [ sec : bar ] do not represent a proper illustration of bar - driven evolution processes .",
    "this is because , although those properties become more extreme as the bar strengthens , most of them are established on timescales equivalent to the bar formation itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we thus concentrate on ( presumably ) bar - driven processes which take place gradually over a much longer timescale ( i.e.  tens of dynamical times ) .    in the context of the bar hypothesis , the interaction between the natural frequencies of the system ( e.g. , the angular and epicyclic frequencies of the circular orbits ) and the pattern speed of the bar implies the existence of resonances , around which the galaxy is shaping .",
    "the photometric and kinematic features we observe in ngc7332 will thus likely be associated with those resonances .",
    "the double disk structure is particularly interesting in this respect since it likely builds up gradually through bar - driven processes @xcite .",
    "the inner disk is usually interpreted as marking the region within the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "the major - axis plateau observed by @xcite extends to a radius of about @xmath32 ( @xmath33  kpc ) , setting a lower limit for the length of the bar . assuming the standard corotation radius to bar length ratio @xmath34 for early - type barred galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath35 .",
    "a simple model then predicts the ilr to be at roughly @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) , indeed marking the transition between the inner disk and the outer disk . this may be supported by the line - strength index maps , where there is evidence for a weak decrease of the fe5015 , mg@xmath31 and fe5270 profiles at about @xmath37 along the major - axis ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : indices ] and [ fig : ls_profiles ] ) .",
    "a comparison with the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc4570 appears appropriate here , since it may be at a different stage of a similar ( bar - driven ) process .",
    "ngc4570 was studied in detail by @xcite , who identified similar morphological features ( i.e.  double disk and intermediate boxy structures ) to those in ngc7332 .",
    "their study also revealed the same trends in ellipticity and boxiness ( @xmath38 ) . the case for a bar was made there almost exclusively based on the identification of two edge - on rings , exceptionally well characterized and consistent with the locations of bar resonances .",
    "the structures observed in ngc4570 are however one order of magnitude smaller than in ngc7332 : the nuclear disk is less than @xmath39 in radius and the inner ring is at a radius of @xmath40 .",
    "the main difference between the two galaxies then lies in the detection of a large - scale bar of about @xmath41  kpc in ngc7332 , whereas @xcite hinted at the presence of an inner bar of @xmath42  pc in ngc4570 ( with no evidence of a large - scale bar ) .",
    "another obvious qualitative difference is the presence of a significant amount of counter - rotating stars and gas in the central region of ngc7332 .",
    "we could speculate on the existence of a secondary bar in ngc7332 , but its detection would require high spatial resolution photometry with high signal - to - noise ( e.g.  hst wfpc-2 or acs images ) .",
    "it may thus well be that ngc7332 is simply in an earlier stage of a gradual bar - driven evolutionary process .",
    "the formation of decoupled cores is often mentioned within the hierarchical structure formation framework ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , involving multiple mergers to form galaxies .",
    "as mentioned above , although there is no evidence for a recent major merger , the gas distribution and kinematics strongly suggest that ngc7332 was recently involved in an interaction event ( most likely with ngc7339 ) .",
    "the kdc could then correspond to the last or one of the last major accretion ( and star formation ) events in such a hierarchy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the bar itself could be the result of that same event , as bar are easily excited by tidal interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the neighbour galaxy ngc7339 , a sb galaxy placed 5  away from ngc7332 , is most likely the one responsible for such an event .",
    "the position of this galaxy is such that the offplane gas clump found in ngc7332 could well be a direct continuation of the west side of ngc7339 s disk .",
    "additionally , the maximum receding velocity measured on the west side of this galaxy is @xmath431525 @xcite , which is strikingly similar to the radial velocity of the high velocity clump in ngc7332 ( @xmath431550 ) .",
    "this picture leads to the suggestion that this clump is linked to ngc7339 .",
    "deep hi observations could confirm this idea .",
    "it is hard to assess which of the bar or the interaction occurred first , and whether the kdc was formed from material funneled by the former or the latter .",
    "ngc7332 will , however , continue to evolve on a timescale of a few @xmath44  yr . as emphasized above , the gas will settle down due to its dissipative nature , and some of it may feed the inner few arcseconds ( with or without more star formation ) . in this context , ngc7332 may be seen as a precursor of the now gas - poor edge - on s0 galaxy ngc4570 .",
    "we presented in this paper new  integral - field spectroscopy observations of the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc7332 , along with a discussion of existing ground and space - based imaging .",
    "the photometric analysis reveals a boxy bulge , a central disk and evidence for the presence of a bar ( section  [ sec : phot ] ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the  observations provide unprecedented coverage of the stellar and gas kinematics .",
    "in particular , the stellar kinematics displays a rather smooth velocity field with rotation along the major - axis and a weak dependence of rotation on galactic height .",
    "we also discovered a stellar kinematically decoupled component ( kdc ) misaligned with respect to the galaxy s kinematic major - axis , which may be related to a dip in the centre of the velocity dispersion map ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we finally provided kinematic evidence for the presence of a larger central stellar disk ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "ngc7332 presents significant ionised gas emission in the spectral range studied , in particular in the  ( @xmath47   ) and  ( @xmath48 and @xmath49   ) lines . we used a sophisticated technique to separate the absorption and emission lines , yielding both pure absorption spectra from which to derive the stellar kinematics and pure emission spectra for the gas kinematics ( and distribution ) .",
    "the emission maps reveal a very complex gas morphology and kinematics .",
    "this is found especially in which is mainly counter - rotating with respect to the stars .",
    "the gas maps ( figure  [ fig : gaskin ] ) show significant amounts of gas at high relative velocities outside of the equatorial plane , whereas the central parts display rather ordered motions .",
    "we also found traces of a faint co - rotating ionised gas component .",
    "the analysis of the absorption line - strengths in ngc7332 show that its stellar populations are generally young ( @xmath50  gyr ) , not only in the disk but also in the bulge , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the metallicity indices ( i.e.  fe5015 , mg@xmath31 , fe5270 ) show an increase in the centre , contrasting with the rather homogeneous  index .",
    "there is also weak evidence of a decrease at @xmath51 , between the central and the outer disks .",
    "the existence of a large - scale bar in ngc7332 can simultaneously explain most of the features found in the galaxy .",
    "the boxy morphology can be explained by the thickness of the bar after buckling , which also leads to homogeneous stellar populations across the bulge and disk .",
    "the stellar kinematics can similarly be explained by the particular orbital structure of barred disks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the kdc , on the other hand , was most likely formed through late gas infall , an accretion event perhaps related to the complex ionised gas distribution currently seen .    as emphasized by the unique data set presented in this paper , the s0 galaxy ngc7332 possesses a number of peculiar properties helping to unravel its formation and evolution processes .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that interactions played a role in the shaping of ngc7332 , while the bar has and is certainly significantly affecting its evolution .",
    "given the amount of gas yet to settle and the relatively young age of the stellar populations in ngc7332 , it probably represents an earlier evolutionary stage of more regular edge - on s0 galaxies ( i.e.  ngc4570 , @xcite ; ngc3115 , @xcite ; ngc3377 , @xcite )",
    ". the morphology and dynamics of present - day s0 galaxies can thus probably be understood through the combined effects of both interactions and bar - driven processes .",
