    "block copolymers are formed from two or more types of monomer , which are linked in such a way that monomers of a given type are grouped together in long intervals , or blocks @xcite .",
    "these materials not only have engineering applications , for example in lithography @xcite , but can also mimic biological systems @xcite .",
    "the utility of block copolymers arises from their ability to _ self - assemble _ into a range of structures .",
    "a striking example of this behavior is seen when the block copolymers are dissolved in a solvent such as a liquid or a homopolymer .",
    "consider a simple block copolymer with two sections ( a _ diblock _ copolymer ) , one of which is solvophobic , or incompatible with the solvent . at high enough copolymer concentration , the solvophobic segments of the polymer will cluster together in order to minimize their contact with the solvent .",
    "a wide variety of structures can be formed in this way @xcite , including spheres and cylinders of copolymer known as _",
    "micelles _ and hollow pockets ( _ vesicles _ ) . both micelles and vesicles may be used to encapsulate active chemicals such as drugs @xcite . although the basic principle behind the self - assembly of block copolymers can be easily explained , making quantitative predictions about which structure will be formed by a given system is a much more difficult problem .",
    "this depends sensitively on many different factors @xcite , particularly the structure of the copolymer molecules .",
    "designing block copolymers that will self - assemble into the structure required by a particular application can hence be difficult , and there is a clear need for theoretical work to provide guidance for experiment .    a theory with strong potential for furthering",
    "our understanding of the self - assembly of block copolymers in solution is _ self - consistent field theory _ ( scft ) , a mean - field theory of an ensemble of flexible polymers .",
    "this theory has had much success in modeling melts and blends of block copolymers @xcite . however",
    ", much previous research in the field has focused on the formation of periodic structures @xcite , with the scft equations often being solved in fourier space . in this paper , we present a detailed comparison of _ real - space _ scft with experiment for local , isolated aggregates of block copolymers .",
    "we concentrate on the formation of spherical micelles , cylindrical micelles , and flat bilayers in blends of diblock copolymer and homopolymer and predict which of these structures will be formed for a given blend .",
    "this system is well suited to provide a test of scft , for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , detailed experimental data on the formation of different aggregates are available @xcite .",
    "in addition , and in contrast to the situation in aqueous solutions , the interactions between the different types of polymer are well described by the flory @xmath0 parameter @xcite .",
    "this parameter , and the other quantities ( such as molar volumes ) needed as input to scft , are readily obtained from the literature @xcite .",
    "we compare our predictions with the x - ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy experiments of kinning , winey and thomas @xcite , which study poly(styrene - butadiene ) diblocks in homopolystyrene .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such data have not been modeled in detail , using experimentally - determined polymer architectures and molecular weights , with scft .",
    "although a significant amount of research has been carried out on the self - consistent field theory of micelle formation , this largely considers diblocks dissolved in _ monomer _",

    "the details of the polystyrene / polybutadiene ( ps / pb ) system are presented in sec .",
    "[ system_details ] , along with the basic phenomenology of shape transitions .",
    "section [ scft ] provides a brief overview of the self - consistent field theory of a copolymer / homopolymer blend , and introduces the numerical methods used to solve the scft equations .",
    "we then present and discuss our results ( sec .",
    "[ results ] ) and the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "kinning , winey and thomas @xcite carried out x - ray and transmission electron microscopy measurements on blends of poly(styrene - butadiene ) diblock copolymer and polystyrene homopolymer . in order to determine the effects of the molecular weight of the polymers and the relative amounts of styrene and butadiene in the diblocks on the shape of the aggregates formed ,",
    "several samples were studied .",
    "we follow the notation used in this paper @xcite when labeling these blends .",
    "for example , a diblock of polystyrene molar weight 10 kg / mol and polybutadiene molar weight 65 kg / mol is referred to as sb 10/65 .",
    "homopolystyrene of molar weight 2.1 kg / mol is labeled 2100 ps .",
    "the numbers used for labeling purposes can be quite rough : the precise molecular weights used in our calculations can be found in the original paper @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the quantities by which the polymer samples are characterized : their specific volumes , the root mean square end - to - end distances of the polymer molecules and the _ interaction energy density _ of polystyrene and polybutadiene .",
    "measurements of the specific volume of pb as a function of temperature ( in degrees celsius ) can be fitted empirically by @xcite @xmath1 whilst the corresponding formula for ps is @xcite @xmath2 the temperature @xmath3 is @xmath4 in all experiments considered here .",
    "the scft equations are usually written in terms of the volumes of individual molecules @xmath5 , with @xmath6 representing pb or ps .",
    "these are calculated from eqns [ v_pb ] and [ v_ps ] by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the molar weight of polymer @xmath6 .",
    "the root - mean - square end - to - end distances of the polymer molecules are given , also empirically , by @xcite @xmath9 where the molar weights @xmath8 are in g / mol .",
    "the experimental work considered here @xcite describes the strength of the interaction between polystyrene and polybutadiene using the _ interaction energy density _",
    "@xcite , rather than the more usual @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the energy of this interaction is given by @xmath11 where the @xmath12 terms are the local volume fractions of the two polymer species @xmath6 at position @xmath13 .",
    "for reference , the interaction energy density @xmath10 is related to the @xmath0 parameter by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "@xmath16 is a reference volume , such as the average of the repeat unit volumes of the two polymers @xcite .",
    "the advantage of working in terms of @xmath10 rather than @xmath0 is that it avoids the introduction of this arbitrary reference volume @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the polystyrene - polybutadiene interaction energy density is given , again empirically , by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "depending on the molecular weights of the different components of the blend and the ratio of pb to ps in the copolymer , the system was found to form spherical or cylindrical micelles or bilayers @xcite .",
    "we now present a brief discussion of the factors that affect which of these is most likely to form . consider a melt of symmetric copolymers , such as sb 20/20 , with no homopolystyrene .",
    "this will form a periodic , lamellar structure , since the layers have no natural curvature . however , if polystyrene homopolymer is added , this will mix preferentially with the polystyrene segments of the copolymer , leading the ps / pb interface to become curved and cylindrical or spherical micelles to form @xcite .",
    "the degree of swelling determines which morphology will be observed : if a large amount of homopolymer penetrates the polystyrene corona , the interface between the two species will have a high curvature and spherical micelles will be favored .",
    "when less swelling of the corona takes place , cylindrical micelles will form .",
    "it is also possible to form ( nearly ) planar bilayers in a blend of diblock copolymer and homopolymer if the diblock polymer is strongly asymmetric , with the polybutadiene core block being several times heavier than the polystyrene corona block @xcite . in this case , swelling of the polystyrene by the homopolystyrene solvent may balance the effect of the larger polybutadiene block and lead to roughly equal effective volume fractions for the two species .",
    "bilayers which are too large have a strong tendency to form vesicles , to eliminate the energy cost of forming edges .",
    "however , in this paper we will only consider the formation of infinite bilayers and will delay the detailed discussion of vesicle formation to a future study .",
    "self - consistent field theory ( scft ) @xcite is an equilibrium , mean - field theory of a melt or blend of polymers . the description of the polymers is coarse - grained : the configuration of an individual polymer molecule is taken to be a random walk in space @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a curve parameter specifying the position along the molecule .",
    "the interactions between polymers are modeled by assuming that the blend is incompressible and introducing a contact potential between molecules of different species . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ system_details ] , the strength of this potential is specified by the interaction energy density @xmath10 .",
    "simulation of the system described above for a realistically large number of molecules would require a tremendous amount of computing power .",
    "scft lowers the computational requirements sharply by first reducing the @xmath22-body problem of modeling an ensemble of @xmath22 polymers of @xmath6 different species to @xmath6 @xmath23-body problems , and then introducing mean - field approximations to make these computationally tractable .",
    "the first step in this procedure is to view each molecule as being acted on by a field produced by all other molecules in the blend @xcite .",
    "this transforms the @xmath22-body problem into @xmath22 @xmath23-body problems .",
    "since we wish to compute the partition sum over all configurations of the system , all molecules of a given species may be treated as equivalent .",
    "therefore , we need only introduce one field @xmath24 for each species @xmath6 and have only to solve @xmath6 @xmath23-body problems .",
    "note that no approximation has yet been made  the complexity of the system is now contained in the fields @xmath24 , which are yet to be calculated .",
    "the success of scft arises from the fact that approximations may be found more easily for the fields than for the original formulation of the problem .",
    "we now outline the rest of the derivation of scft for the specific case of our diblock copolymer / homopolymer blend . as discussed above ,",
    "we introduce fields @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 acting on the polystyrene blocks , polybutadiene blocks and homopolystyrene respectively .",

    "once we know the optimum micelle in each geometry , we can compare their free energies to find the morphology with the lowest free energy , i.e. , the morphology that will be formed in a given blend . in our discussion of the scft method",
    "above , we considered a simple system of fixed volume and fixed copolymer volume fraction containing one micelle . to find the micelle of a given symmetry with the lowest free energy",

    "the equilibrium state of this system can be found by minimizing the total free energy @xmath54 , or equivalently the free energy density @xmath68 ( since the total volume @xmath67 is constant ) .",
    "if the copolymer concentration is above a certain value ( the _ critical micelle concentration _ ) , copolymer chains can either exist as monomers or in micelles .",
    "the number density of micelles is thus an internal degree of freedom and the macroscopic system varies this quantity ( subject to the constraint of fixed copolymer volume fraction ) in order to minimize the free energy density @xmath68 .",
    "explicit calculations on this many - micelle macrosopic system are extremely time - consuming even using scft .",

    "the former is applicable if the micellar solution is sufficiently dilute while the latter introduces a ( small ) correction term to the free energy which will be included by hand later in this section . in this case , we can reduce the many - micelle system to a one - micelle system of volume @xmath32 and copolymer volume fraction @xmath66 , where @xmath32 corresponds to the volume per micelle .",

    "we define the core radius as that at which the local volume fractions of the core species pb and the corona species ps are equal : @xmath79 .",
    "this choice is arbitrary ; however , the boundaries are quite sharp and so the differences between different definitions are rather small .",
    "to estimate @xmath78 , we first calculate the radius of gyration of the corona from @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the polystyrene concentration at the boundary of the subsystem .",
    "this bulk value must be removed to isolate the corona .",
    "we now calculate the thickness @xmath78 of the spherical shell with inner radius @xmath77 ( the core radius as calculated above ) which has the same radius of gyration as the corona .",

    "we now have all the necessary techniques to calculate the optimum micelle of a given geometry .",
    "to begin , we perform an scft calculation at fixed subsystem volume , giving the density profile of a micelle and the free energy density of the subsystem .",
    "we then adjust the subsystem volume .",
    "this is achieved by changing the number of points on the grid on which we solve the diffusion equations whilst keeping the grid stepsize constant .",
    "this is repeated until we have located the minimum of the free energy density for the geometry under consideration .",
    "the free energy densities for the different shapes of aggregate are then compared to find which is most likely to form for a given blend .",
    "although having to minimize @xmath85 with respect to @xmath32 for each system parameter adds to the numerical burden of the calculation , the advantage of this method is that , by minimizing the free energy density , we avoid the awkward problem of trying to define the free energy per chain in the micelle , which is the basic quantity in simple theories of micellization @xcite .",
    "taking this latter approach would involve making ad hoc definitions concerning the boundary of the micelle in what is essentially a continuum calculation .",
    "the only problem with our method is that , while the free energy of the micelle is modeled accurately by scft , the free energy of the bulk is modeled poorly @xcite .",
    "fortunately , we expect the error in calculating the free energy density introduced by the bulk to be small since most block copolymer chains in our calculations are in the micelle .",
    "the phase boundaries between different micelle shapes should therefore be fairly accurate .",
    "this will be confirmed by the work presented here .",
    "nevertheless , the difficulty in modeling the bulk means that minimizing the free energy density does not necessarily yield the _ density profile _ of the optimum micelle ( the micelle with the lowest free energy per chain ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , since the bulk copolymer concentration is severely underestimated @xcite , fixing the overall copolymer volume fraction to a realistic value means that the number of chains in the micelle will be overestimated . in consequence ,",
    "the profiles of spherical micelles obtained from our current minimization method are swollen compared to experimental data @xcite .    if we wish to study the density profiles of micelles _ of a given geometry _ , we must accept the fact that scft systematically underestimates the copolymer concentration with which the micelle coexists , and take an alternative approach to finding the optimum micelle .",
    "we have carried out this task elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our method was to minimize the free energy per copolymer chain _ in the micelle _",
    "we performed calculations on a single micelle in a system of _ fixed _ volume that was sufficiently large for the copolymer concentration to have attained a constant ( bulk ) value at the edge of the system .",
    "we then noted that this bulk copolymer concentration coexisting with the micelle is a monotonically increasing function of the bulk chemical potential .",
    "however , at equilibrium , the bulk chemical potential is equal to the free energy per chain in the micelle @xcite .",
    "we can therefore minimize the free energy per chain in the micelle ( as required ) by minimizing the copolymer concentration at the edge of our system with respect to the overall copolymer concentration .",
    "in other words , we used the bulk copolymer concentration as a proxy for the free energy per chain in this approach .",
    "this avoids the ambiguities inherent in defining a free energy per chain in a continuum model .",
    "this approach was successful in making quantitative predictions for the core radii for spherical copolymer micelles in homopolymer .",
    "however , it is not suitable for the current problem of studying micelle phase transitions , since the free energy per chain in the micelle may not be a monotonic function of bulk block copolymer concentrations across different micelle geometries . therefore , to determine the phase boundaries between these different morphologies , the best method is to minimize the free energy density with respect to the subsystem volume @xmath32 , as is done in the current paper . once the micelle shape for a given system has been determined , more refined predictions for the micelle profile may be obtained , if required , by minimizing bulk block copolymer concentrations .",
    "we begin by examining the shape transition that occurs as we move from a symmetric copolymer to one with a heavier polybutadiene core block at constant homopolymer molecular weight , and compare our predictions with the experimental results of kinning , winey and thomas @xcite .",
    "our predictions are presented as follows . in the inset to fig .",

    "however , it may quickly be seen that the differences in free energy densities between the different blends are much larger than those between the different morphologies in a given blend .",
    "this makes it difficult to see which free energy is the lowest for a particular blend and hence which shape is the most likely to form . to avoid this problem",
    ", we normalize our results by the magnitude of @xmath87 for the cylindrical morphology and plot the quantity @xmath88 . in the case of the cylinder , this is simply a horizontal line at @xmath89 .",
    "the corresponding lines for the bilayer and sphere approach this from above and below respectively as the homopolymer molecular weight is increased , and the transitions between the morphologies may be clearly seen .",
    "we plot the data in this manner throughout the paper .",
    "firstly , we consider a blend of symmetric sb 10/10 copolymer with 3900ps .",
    "the weight percentage of copolymer is @xmath90 .",
    "this system is found experimentally @xcite to form spherical micelles .",
    "the reason for this is that the entropy of mixing between the small homopolymer 3900ps and the polystyrene blocks is very high .",
    "the homopolystyrene then swells the polystyrene corona , making the interface between the two species naturally very curved and causing spherical micelles to form .",
    "our scft calculations ( fig .  [ sb10-nn-3900 ] ) also find that the sphere is the most favorable aggregate , with the lowest free energy density .",
    "if the weight of the polybutadiene block is increased , a different morphology is found .",
    "specifically , the copolymer is changed from sb 10/10 to sb 10/23 .",
    "the same homopolymer 3900ps is still used , and the weight percentage of copolymer is @xmath91 .",
    "kinning , winey and thomas @xcite found that this system formed multilamellar vesicles : concentric shells of copolymer . in line with this experimental finding , we predict that the bilayer is the most energetically favorable structure ( see fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900 ] ) .    to gain physical insight into this transition , we plot cross - sections through two different spherical micelles in fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900phi ] . in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900phi ] , we plot the volume fraction profiles of the three different species for a spherical micelle in the first blend considered in fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900 ] : @xmath90 sb 10/10 in 3900 ps homopolymer .",
    "this structure has the lowest free energy density and hence is the most likely to form .",
    "the reason for this is that it has a corona that is strongly swollen by homopolymer and a relatively small core .",
    "this means that the interface between ps and pb is highly curved and the spherical micelle shown here is observed in experiment @xcite .    in the inset to fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900phi ] , we show the volume fraction profiles for a spherical micelle in the second blend shown in fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900 ] , namely @xmath92 sb 10/23 copolymer in 3900 ps .",
    "the spherical micelle plotted here is predicted to be the _",
    "least _ energetically favorable structure , and the physical reasons are clear from its density profile . here , the corona is also clearly swollen by the small homopolymer , and the volume fraction profiles for the corona and homopolymer are very similar to those seen in the blend containing the symmetric copolymer sb 10/10 ( main panel of fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-3900phi ] ) .",
    "however , the polybutadiene block is much heavier in sb 10/23 , and the radius of the core is hence much larger .",
    "this compensates for the swelling of the corona , and the curvature of the ps / pb interface is much smaller . as a result , bilayers are formed , which , in the experimental system , wrap up into multilamellar vesicles to avoid energy penalties due to the formation of edges .",
    "the spherical micelle shown here has a higher free energy density than either of the other two morphologies and is not found experimentally @xcite .",
    "a similar shape transition may be seen if we consider blends of asymmetric copolymer with the very short homopolymer 2100 ps .",
    "if the sb 10/23 copolymer discussed above is blended with 2100 ps rather than 3900 ps , scattering and tem experiments ( at copolymer weight percentage @xmath93 ) @xcite find that it forms spherical micelles instead of multilamellar vesicles .",
    "as above , the reason for this is that the entropy of mixing between the polystyrene corona blocks and the small homopolymer is very high .",
    "the corona thus becomes very swollen , outweighing the effect of the relatively large core .",
    "this results in a highly curved ps / pb interface and spherical micelles are observed .",
    "our calculations ( fig .  [ sb10-nn-2100 ] ) predict that the cylinder is slightly more favorable than the sphere seen in experiments @xcite ; however , both structures have clearly much lower free energy densities than the bilayer .",
    "in addition , the experiments necessarily work with a limited selection of homopolymers , and there will be occasions when a relatively small error in the calculation of the free energy causes a morphology to be incorrectly predicted .",
    "we can also understand the overestimation of the favorability of the cylindrical micelle by recalling that , by considering an infinite cylinder , we neglect the free energy penalties due to endcaps and the curvature of the micelle .    in electron micrographs of a blend of the highly asymmetric copolymer sb 10/65 with 2100 ps at @xmath94 , a lamellar structure",
    "is seen @xcite .",
    "this is also predicted by self - consistent field theory ( see fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-2100 ] ) , which finds that the lamella has a much lower free energy density than the cylinder .",
    "furthermore , in this blend , we were unable to find a minimum of the free energy density corresponding to a spherical micelle and therefore predict that this structure is unstable .    again , plotting the volume fraction profiles of favorable and unfavorable aggregates allows us to illustrate the physical principles behind the shape transition . here , we focus on the bilayer . in the blend containing sb 10/65 , this structure has the lowest free energy density and is observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "we plot its cross - section in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-2100phi ] .",
    "the polystyrene blocks of the copolymer are seen to be significantly swollen by the small homopolymer .",
    "however , the large core block compensates for this , reducing the curvature of the interface and leading to the formation of the planar structure .",
    "this is in contrast to the system with sb 10/23 copolymer shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ sb10-nn-2100phi ] . here , the swelling of the polystyrene blocks is also high , and the density profiles of the corona and homopolystyrene are very similar to those seen in the sb 10/65 blend .",
    "however , in this system , the polybutadiene blocks are much shorter , and the swelling of the polystyrene means that the ps / pb interface naturally has a higher curvature .",
    "the bilayer shown here therefore has a much higher free energy density than those of the sphere and cylinder and is hence not seen in experiment @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , in both cases , the short 2100 ps homopolymer is predicted to penetrate significantly into the pb core ( see fig .  [ sb10-nn-2100phi ] ) .",
    "however , the degree of penetration is similar for both copolymers and the shape transition is not driven by this effect but by the competition between the length of the core pb blocks and the swelling of the ps corona .",
    "next , we study the shape transitions that may be induced by varying the homopolymer molecular weight in a blend of symmetric poly(styrene - butadiene ) diblocks and homopolystyrene at constant copolymer weight percentage .",
    "we consider four samples , all studied experimentally by kinning , winey and thomas @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath95 weight percentage of the symmetric copolymer sb 20/20 is blended with homopolymer . however",
    ", the homopolymer molecular weight is increased from blend to blend .",
    "for the lightest three homopolymers ( 2100ps , 3900ps and 7400ps ) , the experiments find spherical micelles . like the blend of sb10/10 with 3900ps ( see fig .  [ sb10-nn-3900 ] ) , these blends consist of a symmetric copolymer blended with a relatively light homopolymer , which swells the corona blocks and leads to a highly curved ps / pb interface . for the heaviest homopolymer ( 17000ps ) ,",
    "the swelling of the corona is less pronounced , the interface between ps and pb is less curved , and cylindrical micelles are observed .",
    "this trend away from spherical micelles as the homopolymer weight is increased is reproduced by scft ( see fig .",
    "[ sb20 - 20 ] ) .",
    "for the first two blends , we find , in line with experiment @xcite , that the spherical micelle has the lowest free energy density and hence is most likely to form . in the case of the next blend ( 7400ps )",
    ", we predict that the cylinder has a slightly lower free energy density than the sphere .",
    "as stated above , the experiments find that this blend forms spherical micelles @xcite ; however , we find that the difference between the free energy densities of the spherical and cylindrical morphologies is rather small and both micelles are clearly more favorable than the bilayer . as discussed above , the energetic favorability of the cylindrical micelle with respect to the spherical micelle is slightly overestimated probably due to our neglect of free energy penalties due to the endcaps of the cylinder .    for the blend with the heaviest homopolymer ( 17000ps ) ,",
    "we predict that the bilayer has the lowest free energy density ( see fig .",
    "[ sb20 - 20 ] ) , whilst the experiments find cylindrical micelles .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy arises because , by considering ideal infinite structures , we have neglected edge effects that make the heavier of the two competing structures ( here , the bilayer ) less likely to form .",
    "specifically , for micelles with aggregation number @xmath22 , the edge penalty per copolymer falls off as @xmath96 for cylinders but only as @xmath97 for bilayers",
    "we therefore expect that neglecting edge effects overestimates the stability of bilayers relative to cylinders .    to illustrate the swelling of the polystyrene corona by homopolystyrene that drives the transitions between the different morphologies , we proceed as before and plot cross - sections through two different spherical micelles in fig .",
    "[ sb20 - 20phi ] .",
    "the main part of the figure shows the volume fraction profiles for the core , corona and solvent for a blend of sb 20/20 with 3900ps with @xmath95 copolymer by weight .",
    "this is the second system plotted in fig .",
    "[ sb20 - 20 ] , and forms spherical micelles .",
    "it can immediately be seen that the corona is strongly swollen by the ( small ) homopolymer : the maximum local volume fraction of the polystyrene blocks is around @xmath98 . to compensate for the swelling of the corona @xcite ,",
    "the core radius is relatively small : around @xmath99 . in consequence ,",
    "the interface between pb and ps is naturally strongly curved , and the spherical micelle shown here is the most favorable structure .",
    "this is in contrast to the system shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ sb20 - 20phi ] : a blend of sb 20/20 copolymer with 17000ps , again at copolymer weight percentage @xmath95 .",
    "the spherical micelle plotted here is predicted to be the least energetically favorable structure .",
    "the reasons for this are as follows .",
    "firstly , the heavy 17000ps homopolymer mixes much less well with the polystyrene blocks , so that the corona is much less swollen by homopolymer .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the peak local volume fraction of the polystyrene is far higher ( around @xmath100 ) than in the sphere - forming blend shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ sb20 - 20phi ] .",
    "secondly , the core radius is approximately @xmath101 : significantly higher than in the blend with 3900ps homopolymer .",
    "the interface between the polybutadiene core blocks and the polystyrene corona blocks is therefore naturally less curved , and the spherical micelle does not form .",
    "we summarize our results in table [ tab : summary ] , listing the experimentally- and theoretically - determined morphologies for all the blends discussed above .",
    "all trends are correctly predicted and the correct shape is predicted for five out of the eight blends . the percentage difference between the free energies ( relative to the homogeneous state ) of the shape predicted to be the most favorable and that predicted to be the next most favorable",
    "is also included for each blend .",
    "note that the three samples for which the shape is incorrectly predicted ( sb 10/23 in 2100 ps , sb 20/20 in 7400 ps and sb 20/20 in 17000 ps ) also have the three smallest free energy differences between the two most favorable states .",
    "this suggests that , in these cases , we are close to the transitions between morphologies and any slight inaccuracy in the theory or in the measurement of experimental parameters could lead to an incorrect prediction of the shape .",
    "we emphasize that our calculations contain no adjustable parameters : all the required input concerning the polymer properties ( such as the interaction energy density @xmath10 ) has been determined from experiments that do not involve micelle formation .",
    "given this fact , we believe that the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent .",
    "we have found that self - consistent field theory gives a good description of the different isolated structures that form in a blend of diblock copolymers and homopolymer . in the majority of cases",
    ", scft predicts the morphology seen in experiment @xcite , and all qualitative effects ( such as the trend away from spherical micelles as the homopolymer weight is increased ) are reproduced .    even when the shape is not correctly predicted , the difference between the free energy density of the structure seen in experiment and that predicted to have the lowest free energy density by scft is very small ( see , for example , the first set of points in fig .  [ sb10-nn-2100 ] , where scft predicts a cylindrical structure but spheres are seen in experiment ) .",
    "the tendency of our scft calculations to overestimate the favorability of heavier aggregates may be understood by considering finite size contributions to the free energy , such as the energy penalties due to the cylinder endcaps and bilayer edges , that are neglected by our approach .    in summary , we have shown that scft provides a very good description of micelle shape transitions and hence that it is a suitable tool for the study of isolated block copolymer aggregates , provided the limitations of the theory are recognized when identifying the appropriate free energy to minimize . in particular , the free energy density must be minimized with respect to the volume of the subsystem containing a micelle to calculate shape transitions , whilst the free energy per chain in the micelle ( in practice , the bulk block copolymer concentration ) should be minimized to give more refined predictions of the micelle density profile .",
