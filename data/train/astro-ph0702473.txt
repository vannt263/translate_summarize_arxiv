    "a localized excess of emission in the microwave region was first detected in the @xmath0/dmr data and was initially attributed to free  free emission ( kogut et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "since then this anomalous emission has been detected by a number of authors ( de oliveira - costa et al .",

    "1997 ) implied gas temperatures in excess of @xmath4k , which were rejected on energetic grounds by draine & lazarian ( 1998a ) .",
    "its physical mechanism has yet to be constrained ; the most popular interpretation is that of rapidly rotating dust grains , or @xmath5 @xmath6 ( draine & lazarian 1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "other mechanisms which have been proposed include magnetic dust emission ( draine & lazarian 1999 ) , flat spectrum synchrotron ( bennett et al .",
    "2003b ) , and bremsstrahlung from very hot electrons ( leitch et al . 1997 ) .",
    "spinning dust causes an excess of emission in the 10  50ghz region of the spectrum , where the combination of synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and thermal dust emission is a minimum , and is problematic especially for cmb experiments which utilise this region to minimise foreground contamination and avoid atmospheric emission .",
    "consequently the presence of a poorly constrained foreground such as this anomalous dust emission is a potentially serious problem for cmb observers and needs to be better understood in order to be correctly removed .",
    "this has led to several directed observations ( finkbeiner et  al .",

    ", dl98b also suggest that it may be possible to detect @xmath7ghz emission from spinning dust in photodissociation regions . here",
    "we present observations at 33ghz towards two hii regions and one supernova remnant ( snr ) for which infrared observations imply the presence of significant photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "the vsa is a 14 element interferometer sited at the teide observatory , in tenerife , at an altitude of 2400 m .",
    "the vsa operates in a single 1.5ghz wide channel at a central frequency of 33ghz ( scott et  al .",
    "the 14 antennas use hemt amplifiers with typical system temperature @xmath835k . in its new super - extended configuration",
    "the vsa uses mirrors of diameter 65 cm .",
    "the horn - reflector antennas are mounted on a tilt table hinged east  west and each antenna individually tracks the observed field by rotating its horn axis perpendicularly to the table hinge , wavefront coherence being maintained with an electronic path compensator system ( watson et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the individual tracking of the vsa antennas allows for the filtering of contaminating signals .",
    "these may be celestial sources , such as the sun and moon , or ground - spill and other environment based spurious signals .",
    "the vsa also uses a ground - shield to minimise ground - spill .",
    "the consequences of this design are two - fold .",
    "first , the vsa is able to observe continuously and can filter out emission from the sun and moon when they are as close as @xmath9 .",
    "second , the vsa is unaffected by ground - spill contamination for fields within 35@xmath10 of the zenith and so is able to make direct images of the sky , rather than employing the lead ",
    "trail approach of many other interferometers operating in the microwave band .",
    "observations were carried out as single pointings with a primary beam of 72arcmin fwhm .",
    "the data were calibrated using taua and casa in accordance with vsa reduction procedures .",
    "this calibration , along with appropriate flagging and filtering of the data , was performed using the special purpose package reduce developed specifically for reduction of vsa observations .",
    "details of the vsa reduction and calibration procedure can be found in dickinson et al ( 2004 ) and references therein .",
    "many surveys at lower frequency do not have similar resolution to the super - extended vsa , making comparison difficult .",
    "instead we extrapolate from the effelsberg 100 m telescope at 2.7ghz ( f@xmath11rst et al .",
    "these data are single dish maps with a circular beam of 4.3arcmin fwhm .    for a robust comparison",
    "the 2.7ghz effelsberg maps were multiplied by the primary beam of the vsa and visibility sampling was performed in the @xmath12plane with a correction for the effelsberg beam .",
    "the hii region lph96 ( ra = 06@xmath13 36@xmath14 40@xmath15 , @xmath16 = + 10@xmath10",

    "however , a pointed observation made with the cbi telescope ( dickinson et al . , 2006 ) at 31 ghz shows emission consistent with an approximately flat spectrum source with only little possibility of spinning dust .    at 33ghz the peak flux density of lph96 is 1.100@xmath190.030jy  beam@xmath20 .",
    "the synthesized beam of the vsa towards lph96 is 9.1@xmath216.3arcmin@xmath22 and the source is slightly resolved with structure extending towards the north and southwest .",
    "the 2.7ghz data after sampling gives a peak flux density of 1.436@xmath190.010 jy beam@xmath20 . comparing this with the vsa flux density we find a spectral index @xmath3 = 0.106@xmath190.026 , where the errors are calculated from the thermal noise outside the beam on the 2.7 and 33 ghz maps .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath3 , is here defined so that flux density scales as @xmath23 .",
    "this calculation fails to take into account systematic errors ; taking errors of 5 percent on the flux density scales at each frequency gives @xmath3 = 0.106@xmath190.065 .",
    "the vsa measurement shows no indication of the excess emission which would be expected at 33ghz from the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) spinning dust model of dl98b consistent with the green bank data .",
    "the result is more consistent with that found by the cbi telescope ( dickinson et al .",

    "indeed a spectral index of 0.32 ( @xmath46 , 32 d.o.f . ,",

    "if we include a 5 percent error on the flux calibration these errors are increased to 0.24 and 0.41jy , respectively .",
    "the excess accounts for 37% of the total 33ghz flux density .",
    "radio recombination line observations ( anantharamaiah , 1985 ) put an upper limit on the emission measure of 3c396 of 280@xmath50pc and fits an electron temperature of 5000k for the gas .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the free  free emission from the snr of 0.061jybeam@xmath20 at 33ghz .",
    "the beam sizes used for this measurement are poorly matched to that of the vsa and may cause the values to be over - estimated . taking this into account",
    "it can be seen that the free  free contribution is small compared to the non - thermal and can only account for @xmath512% of the excess emission .",
    "in addition , models including both free  free and non - thermal contributions provide poor fits to the patnaik et  al . data .",

    "( 2003 ) report the presence of a small pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) within the 3c396 snr , although the authors note the lack of any corresponding radio feature in high resolution 20 cm vla images of the remnant ( dyer & reynolds 1999 ) . for this pwn ( or plerion - like component ) , to account for the excess flux density seen at 33ghz it would be very obvious at 1.4ghz , where it would have to contribute approximately 1/6 of the total flux density , assuming a flat spectral index ",
    "olbert et  al .",
    "however suggest that its contribution is @xmath541/25 of the total radio flux density at 1.4ghz .    the infra - red emission at 100@xmath55 m towards 3c396 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:100um ] . in this region of the galactic plane it is not certain whether the emission is associated with the snr remnant , or is merely a projection . reach et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that higher resolution spitzer data shows emission at 3.6 to 8@xmath55 m which may be associated with the snr .",
    "they find irac colours for these regions consistent with both pdrs and hii regions .",
    "if the excess emission seen at 33ghz from 3c396 is associated with these regions then it is possible it may arise from the dipole emission of draine & lazarian ( 1998a;1998b ) .",
    "however , the discrepancy in resolution between the spitzer and vsa telescopes precludes a more detailed spatial analysis .",
    "this possibility is illustrated in figure  [ fig:3c396spec2 ] where the data is shown with the wnm spinning dust model of dl98b .",
    "for clarity we have binned the data of patnaik et  al . at similar frequencies , and have excluded one point at 10.7ghz .",
    "in addition , we note that the wnm model of dl98b , where the column density towards 3c396 is determined from the full - sky magnitude map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , predicts a peak flux density at 33ghz of 3.5jybeam@xmath20 at the resolution of the vsa due to spinning dust .",
    "this gives an integrated flux density of approximately 7jy , using the ratio of peak to integrated flux found with the vsa .",
    "however , it is likely that this method overestimates the integrated flux density since the morphology of the thermal dust emission appears more compact than the emission seen with the vsa .",
    "it is however within a factor of 3 of the excess emission we see at 33ghz .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have assessed the possibility of spinning dust emission at 33ghz towards the snr 3c396 .",
    "apart from cas  a and tau  a , few snr have been studied in the microwave region .",
    "consequently , in order to confirm this possibility further measurements are required in the range 1020ghz .",
