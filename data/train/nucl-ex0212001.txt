    "in 2001 , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) provided gold beams at the full design energy ( ) . the brahms experiment made a unique set of measurements of charged hadrons over a wide range of rapidity ( @xmath4 to @xmath11 ) .",
    "we present here for the first time the rapidity dependence of hadronic yields for the 10% most central events for the reaction au + au at .",
    "the brahms detector system consists of two independent and movable spectrometers ( mrs and fs ) and a set of detectors for reaction characterization ( centrality and interaction point ) .",
    "the ability to rotate the spectrometers added to the use of different magnetic field settings allows the exploration of a large fraction of the full phase - space , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ acc ] for pions .        for the work reported here",
    ", the mrs was operated at 90 , 45 and 40 degrees , and the fs at 3 , 4 , 8 and 12 degrees .",
    "more details about the experimental setup can be found in  @xcite .",
    "since the brahms spectrometers subtend a small solid angle , charged particle spectra are constructed by combining several data sets measured at different angles relative to the beam line with various magnetic fields . for each setting , acceptance correction maps @xmath12 or @xmath13",
    "are built for each particle specie , by using a monte - carlo calculation based on geant3 , simulating the particle tracking through the brahms detector system .",
    "corrections for detector efficiency , absorption and particle decay are then applied to @xmath14 or @xmath15 spectra .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows normalized particle spectra for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at @xmath18 ( top ) and @xmath5 ( bottom ) .    , @xmath17 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at @xmath4 ( top ) and @xmath5 ( bottom ) for the top 10% most central reactions .",
    "positive ( negative ) particle spectra are shown on the left ( right ) panels.,width=472 ]    at mid - rapidity , positive and negative spectra have similar slopes and magnitudes . the inverse slopes increase with the mass of the particles , and for the proton and anti - proton , the spectra reach and exceed the pion yields at @xmath19{gev / c}$ ] , as was observed at  @xcite . at @xmath5 , yields differ between @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as between @xmath2 and @xmath3 although slopes are similar ( cf . table  [ restab ] ) .",
    "rapidity densities were evaluated by fitting the particle spectra with an exponential function @xmath22 $ ] which was then integrated .",
    "statistical errors are between 1% and 4% , whereas systematics errors are estimated to be 15% at mid - rapidity and 20% at the highest rapidity investigated for this analysis .",
    "these errors come from various sources .",
    "one is the extrapolation of the lower part of the @xmath14 spectra .",
    "the mrs acceptance covers 65% of the of the total spectrum range for pions , 60% for kaons and",
    "70% for the protons , while the fs acceptance covers around 50% for pions , 30% for kaons and 60% for protons .",
    "another main source is the use of different data sets where background conditions can differ .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ restab ] and the rapidity density of charged hadrons is shown in fig .",
    "[ dndy ] .    , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the data has been reflected about @xmath23.,width=529 ]    the measured densities fall off by @xmath24 20% in the range @xmath6 .",
    "we also note that the density ratios between matter and antimatter are close to unity , as was already observed in  @xcite .",
    "as we go towards higher rapidities , all particle densities show a significant drop except for the protons ( yields were not corrected for hyperon decays ) .",
    "while @xmath25 and @xmath26 yields decrease evenly , @xmath21 yields drop faster than @xmath20 yields .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ strange ] , which shows the @xmath27 ratios as a function of .",
    "we note that the @xmath7 at midrapidity increases monotonically to 0.18 @xmath8 0.02 ( syst ) as increases .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath9 evolution seems to show a saturation of the positive strangeness from to where it is equal to 0.19 @xmath8 0.02 ( syst ) , which is comparable with the mid - rapidity results from central pb  +  pb reactions at sps  @xcite . at this particular energy ,",
    "no rapidity dependence was observed for @xmath9 but the @xmath7 ratio drops to 0.12 @xmath8 0.02 ( syst ) at @xmath5 . at this rapidity , the ratios are comparable with the results from  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour at the highest rhic energy appears to be consistent with the rapidity dependence of the proton and antiproton yields detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the particle densities of produced charged hadrons exhibit a significant variation with rapidity , that is consistent with a gaussian distribution with a full width of @xmath24 6 units in rapidity for pions . the inverse slopes decrease with increasing rapidity for pions , kaons and protons but differences between particle species still remain at y @xmath28 3 .",
    "this indicates that radial flow is still present at these high rapidities .",
    "the strangeness production is also strongly dependent on rapidity .",
    "it is shown that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are produced in almost equal amounts at mid - rapidity .",
    "as @xmath5 though , we notice that the @xmath7 ratio is about 60% of the @xmath9 ratio , which reflects the decreasing importance of the pair production mechanism with increasing rapidity .",
