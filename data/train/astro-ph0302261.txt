    "the astrophysical origin of the rapid neutron - capture ( @xmath0-process ) species has been a long - standing mystery .",
    "recently , however , a number of important new clues have been provided by spectroscopic studies of extremely - metal - poor stars in the galaxy .",
    "the appearance of neutron - capture elements in these oldest stars in the galaxy , including the pure-@xmath0-process origin of elements such as thorium and uranium , strongly suggests that the @xmath0-process nuclei have come from core - collapse supernovae @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the large star - to - star dispersion of the observed abundances of neutron - capture elements relative to iron in very metal - poor stars is also naturally explained if the @xmath0-process elements originate from a limited mass range of core - collapse supernovae with little iron production ( @xmath1 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "qian & wasserburg ( 2003 ; see also wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2001 , 2002 ) have proposed that the production of the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath6 ) is decoupled from the production of iron - peak and @xmath7 nuclei by comparison of observed abundances among the extremely metal - poor stars . in this view , the production site of the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei is associated with the accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a ( carbon - oxygen or oxygen - neon - magnesium ) white dwarf in a binary system @xcite , or type  ii supernovae from @xmath1 stars @xcite .",
    "so far , the `` neutrino wind '' scenario , in which the free nucleons accelerated by the intense neutrino flux near the neutrino sphere of a core - collapse supernova assemble to heavier nuclei , has been believed to be the most promising astrophysical site of the @xmath0-process @xcite .",
    "even this scenario , however , encounters some difficulties @xcite . for example , @xcite have shown that an extremely compact proto - neutron star , e.g. , @xmath8 and 10  km , must be formed in order to account for the solar @xmath0-process pattern , at least within the framework of a spherically symmetric explosion .",
    "although its possibility can not be excluded , such a compact remnant is allowed by only a few of the many existing equations of state of nuclear matter .",
    "in addition , recent spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo indicate that the observed abundance patterns of the lighter ( @xmath9 ) and heavier ( @xmath10 ) neutron - capture elements can not be explained by a single astrophysical site ( e.g. , neutrino winds ) ; there must exist at least two different @xmath0-process sites @xcite .",
    "hence , it is of special importance to consider alternative possibilities for the occurrence of the @xmath0-process in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "@xcite has shown that @xmath1 stars form an electron - degenerate oxygen - neon - magnesium ( o - ne - mg ) core that does not undergo further nuclear burning ; rather , it directly collapses due to electron capture on @xmath11 mg and @xmath12ne ( miyaji et al . 1980 ) .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the collapsing o - ne - mg core explodes in a prompt manner , and @xcite have suggested that the exploding o - ne - mg core could be a viable site for the @xmath0-process .",
    "it has been pointed out that , if the core exploded hydrodynamically prior to the onset of delayed neutrino heating ( i.e. , it underwent a prompt explosion ) , the electron fraction ( electron number per baryon ) , @xmath13 , in the innermost layer of the ejecta would approach @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "earlier works have in fact shown that a robust @xmath0-process proceeds in such conditions @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that the prompt explosion of an @xmath15 star with an iron core might also be a promising site of the @xmath0-process .",
    "they obtained a prompt explosion by an adiabatic core - collapse calculation without inclusion of electron capture and neutrino transport . @xcite",
    "have shown , however , that no explosion is obtained with such a progenitor @xcite , when including electron capture along with a detailed treatment of neutrino transport .",
    "many previous works have suggested that even the lowest mass of core - collapse supernovae ( @xmath16 ) , in which a relatively smaller iron core is formed , may have difficulties in achieving a hydrodynamic explosion @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the question of whether @xmath1 stars that form o - ne - mg cores can explode hydrodynamically is still open .",
    "the possibility that these stars explode promptly remains because of the smaller iron core present at the onset of the core bounce , as well as the smaller gravitational potential of their collapsing cores .",
    "@xcite have obtained a prompt explosion of a @xmath17 star with a @xmath2 o - ne - mg core , while others , using the same progenitor , have not @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained an explosion , not by a prompt shock , but by late - time neutrino heating .",
    "similar results can be seen in the studies of aics .",
    "note that an aic is an analogous phenomenon to a collapsing o - ne - mg core resulted from a single @xmath1 star , since both consist of electron degenerate cores @xcite .",
    "@xcite have obtained an explosion by neutrino heating , while others have not @xcite .",
    "the reason for these different outcomes is due , perhaps , to the application of different equations of state for dense matter , although other physical inputs may also have some influence @xcite .",
    "thus , even if a star of @xmath1 exploded , it would be difficult to derive , with confidence , the physical properties as well as the mass of the ejected matter .",
    "given this highly uncertain situation it is necessary to examine the resulting @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in explosions obtained with different sets of input physics .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate conditions necessary for the production of @xmath0-process nuclei obtained in purely hydrodynamical models of prompt explosions of collapsing o - ne - mg cores , and to explore some of the consequences if those conditions are met .",
    "the core collapse and the subsequent core bounce are simulated by a one - dimensional hydrodynamic code with newtonian gravity (   2 ) .",
    "for simplicity , neutrino transport is not taken into account .",
    "hence , we focus on only hydrodynamical explosions just after core bounce , not on the delayed explosions obtained via late - time neutrino heating . as seen in   2 , the explosion is marginal , and no @xmath0-processing is expected . in order to obtain @xmath0-processed material , we find it necessary to force the occurrence of more energetic explosions .",
    "the energetic explosions are simulated by artificial enhancements of the shock - heating energy , rather than by application of different sets of input physics , for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in these explosions is then calculated with the use of a nuclear reaction network code (   3 ) .",
    "the resulting contribution of the @xmath0-process material created in these simulations to the early chemical evolution of the galaxy is discussed in   4 .",
    "the results of chronometric age dating , using the u - th chronometer pair based on our nucleosynthesis results , is discussed in   5 .",
    "a summary and conclusions follow in   6 .",
    "a pre - supernova model of a @xmath18 star is taken from @xcite , which forms a 1.38 @xmath19 o - ne - mg core near the end of its evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we link this core to a one - dimensional implicit lagrangian hydrodynamic code with newtonian gravity @xcite .",
    "this core is modeled with a finely zoned mesh of 200 mass shells ( @xmath20 to @xmath21 , @xmath22 to @xmath23 , and @xmath24 to the edge of the core ) .",
    "the equation of state of nuclear matter ( eos ) is taken from @xcite , which is based on relativistic mean field theory .",
    "the equation of state for the electron and positron gas includes arbitrary relativistic pairs as well as arbitrary degeneracy .",
    "electron and positron capture on nuclei , as well as on free nucleons , are included , along with the use of the up - to - date rates from @xcite . the capture is suppressed above the neutrino trapping density , taken to be @xmath25  g  @xmath26 , since the neutrino transport process is not taken into account in this study .",
    "this simplification may be appropriate , since neutrinos at the early epoch of the core bounce do not appear to make a significant correction to the entropy compared to that obtained from shock heating as shown by @xcite .",
    "the delayed neutrino heating may not significantly modify the mass trajectories of the outgoing matter either , since the bulk of the ejecta are lifted to @xmath27  km during the first few 100  ms from the onset of the core bounce ( as shown below ) , which is far from the location of the neutrino sphere ( a few tens of kilometers ) .",
    "it is evident , however , that an accurate treatment of neutrino transport will be needed to obtain accurate mass trajectories in future work .",
    "nuclear burning is implemented in a simplified manner .",
    "the composition of the o - ne - mg core is held fixed until the temperature in each zone reaches the onset of oxygen - burning , taken to be @xmath28  k @xcite , at which point the matter is assumed to be instantaneously in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) .",
    "the temperature is then calculated by including its nuclear energy release .",
    "it should be noted that we find a weak @xmath7-rich freezeout in the subsequent post - processing nucleosynthesis calculations (   3 ) , owing to the entropy , @xmath29 , in the ejecta .",
    "this means that the outgoing ejecta are not in perfect nse , which is assumed in our hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "an improvement that takes the non - nse matter properly into account will be needed to obtain more accurate trajectories .",
    "we begin the hydrodynamical computations with this pre - supernova model , which has a density of @xmath30  g  @xmath26 and temperature of @xmath31  k at its center .",
    "the inner @xmath32 has already burned to nse . as a result ,",
    "the central @xmath13 is rather low , 0.37 , owing to electron capture .",
    "the core bounce is initiated when @xmath33  ms has passed from the start of the calculation . at this time",
    "the nse core contains only @xmath34 , which is significantly smaller than the cases of collapsing iron cores ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the central density is @xmath36  g  @xmath26 , significantly lower than that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* slightly above @xmath37  g  @xmath26 ) , although the temperature ( @xmath38  k ) and @xmath13 (= 0.34 ) , are similar .",
    "this difference is perhaps due to the use of a relatively stiff eos in this study .",
    "we find that a very weak explosion results , with an ejected mass of @xmath39 and an explosion energy of @xmath40  ergs ( model q0 in table  1 ) .",
    "the time variations of the radius , temperature , and density of each zone are displayed in figure  1 .",
    "the lowest @xmath13 in the outgoing ejecta is 0.45 , where no @xmath0-processing is expected given the entropy of @xmath29 .",
    "this is in contrast to the very energetic explosions , with ejected masses of @xmath41 , explosion energies of @xmath42  ergs , and low @xmath13 of @xmath14 obtained by @xcite .",
    "this might be a consequence of the lower gravitational energy release owing to the eos applied in this study .    in order to examine the possible operation of the @xmath0-process in the explosion of this model",
    ", we artificially obtain explosions with typical energies of @xmath43  ergs by application of a multiplicative factor ( @xmath44 ) to the shock - heating term in the energy equation ( models  q3 , q5 , and q6 in table  1 ) .",
    "we take this simplified approach in this study , since the main difference between our result and that by @xcite appear to be the lower central density in ours .",
    "if the inner core reached a higher density at the time of core bounce by applying , for example , a softer eos , the matter would obtain higher shock - heating energy .",
    "this is clearly not a self - consistent approach , and a further study is needed to conclude whether such a progenitor star explodes or not , taking into account a more accurate treatment of neutrino transport , as well as with various sets of input physics ( like eoss ) .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that our purpose in this paper is not to justify the prompt explosions of collapsing o - ne - mg cores , but to investigate the conditions necessary for the production of @xmath0-process nuclei from such an event _ if it occurs_.    table  1 lists the multiplicative factor applied to the shock - heating term ( @xmath44 ) , explosion energy ( @xmath45 ) , ejected mass ( @xmath46 ) , and minimum @xmath13 in the ejecta obtained for each model .",
    "energetic explosions with @xmath47  ergs are obtained for @xmath48 ( models  q5 and q6 ) , in which deeper neutronized zones are ejected by the prompt shock , as can be seen in figure  2 ( model  q6 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the weak explosions with @xmath49  ergs ( models  q0 and q3 ) , in which only the surface of the core blows off ( figure  1 ) .",
    "note that the remnant masses for models  q5 and q6 are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , which are significantly smaller than the typical neutron star mass of @xmath52 .",
    "we consider it likely that a mass of @xmath53 is recovered by fallback of the once - ejected matter , as discussed in   4 .    in figure",
    "3 the electron fraction in the ejecta of each model is shown as a function of the ejected mass point , @xmath46 . for models",
    "q0 and q3 , @xmath13 decreases steeply with @xmath46 , since the duration of electron capturing is long , owing to the slowly expanding ejecta ( figure  1 ) . for models",
    "q5 and q6 , on the other hand , @xmath13 decreases gradually with @xmath46 , owing to the fast expansion of the outgoing ejecta .",
    "nevertheless , the inner regions approach very low @xmath13 , 0.30 and 0.14 for models  q5 and q6 , respectively , owing to their rather high density ( @xmath54  g  @xmath26 ) at the time of core bounce ( figure  2 ) .",
    "note that , for model  q6 , @xmath13 increases again for @xmath55 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the positron capture on free neutrons overcomes the electron capture on free protons when the electron degeneracy becomes less effective in the high temperature matter .",
    "the innermost , slowly outgoing region suffers from this effect .",
    "this can be also seen in the results of @xcite , who obtained a neutrino - powered ( not _ prompt _ ) explosion with the same o - ne - mg core .    the minimum @xmath13 ( @xmath56 ) in @xcite is , however , significantly higher than ours .",
    "this is mainly due to neutrino capture on free nucleons , since the matter is driven by intense neutrino flux in their simulation .",
    "@xmath13 might increase further once nucleons begin to assemble into @xmath7 particles and heavy nuclei ( the  @xmath7-effect  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of the prompt explosions considered here ,",
    "however , these neutrino effects may not alter @xmath13 significantly .",
    "the reason is that the bulk of the ejecta are lifted to @xmath57  km at the arrival of the delayed neutrinos ( a few 100  ms from the onset of the core bounce ) , at which the capture timescale of neutrinos on free nucleons is no less than a few seconds ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 1 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamical timescales of the outgoing mass shells in model  q6 at @xmath58 , and 7 ( after the core bounce ) , defined by @xmath59 , are shown in figure  4 . as can be seen ,",
    "the dynamical timescale prior to the @xmath0-process phase ( @xmath60 ) is significantly smaller than that of neutrino interaction .",
    "the trend of the @xmath61 relation up to @xmath62 is similar in models  q5 and q6 , although it is inverted at @xmath63 , owing to the slightly different contribution of the positron and electron capture on free nucleons ( figure  3 ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath61 relation between the surface and the innermost layer of the ejecta is expected to be similar to that of model  q6 , as long as the explosion is sufficiently energetic ( @xmath64  ergs ) . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "therefore , we focus only on model  q6 , which is taken to be representative of cases where @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis occurs . the ejected mass , @xmath46 , is thus taken to be a free parameter , instead of simulating many other models by changing @xmath44 .",
    "note that the results by @xcite and @xcite are very similar to the cases with @xmath65 in model  q6 .",
    "the yields of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis species , adopting the model described in   2 for the physical conditions , are obtained by application of an extensive nuclear reaction network code .",
    "the network consists of @xmath66 species , all the way from single neutrons and protons up to the fermium isotopes ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we include all relevant reactions , i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and their inverses .",
    "reaction rates are taken from thielemann ( 1995 , private communication ) for nuclei with @xmath74 and from @xcite for those with @xmath75 .",
    "the latter used the mass formula by @xcite .",
    "the three - body reaction @xmath76be , which is of special importance as the bottleneck reaction to heavier nuclei , is taken from the recent experimental data of @xcite .",
    "the weak interactions , such as @xmath77-decay , @xmath77-delayed neutron emission ( up to three neutrons ) , and electron capture are also included , although the latter is found to be unimportant .",
    "the @xmath7-decay chains and spontaneous fission processes are taken into account only after the freezeout of all other reactions , as in @xcite .",
    "for the latter , all nuclei with @xmath78 are assumed to decay by spontaneous fission only .",
    "the few known nuclei undergoing spontaneous fission for @xmath79 are also included , along with their branching ratios .",
    "neutron - induced and @xmath77-delayed fissions , as well as the contribution of fission fragments to the lighter nuclei , are neglected .",
    "obviously , these treatments of the fission reactions are oversimplified . nevertheless , this may be acceptable , at least to first order .",
    "we leave more accurate treatment of these matters to future work .",
    "each calculation is started at @xmath80 ( where @xmath81  k ) .",
    "the initial composition is taken to be that of nse with the density and electron fraction at @xmath80 , and consists mostly of free nucleons and alpha particles .    for reasons outlined in   2",
    ", we examine the nucleosynthesis in model  q6 only , in which robust @xmath0-processing is expected .",
    "the resulted abundances in several representative lagrangian mass shells are depicted in figure  5 .",
    "the initial electron fractions are 0.29 , 0.20 , 0.18 , 0.16 , 0.14 , and 0.20 for the corresponding zone numbers 83 , 92 , 95 , 98 , 105 , and 132 , respectively . as can be seen , a robust @xmath0-processing is possible only for @xmath82 . in particular ,",
    "a substantial amount of thorium and uranium are produced only when @xmath13 is less than 0.18 .",
    "the mass - integrated abundances from the surface ( zone 1 ) to the zones 83 , 92 , 95 , 98 , 105 , and 132 are compared with the solar @xmath0-process abundances @xcite in figure  6 ( models  q6a - f in table  2 ) .",
    "the latter is scaled to match the height of the first ( @xmath83 ) and third ( @xmath84 ) peaks of the abundances in models  q6a - b and q6c - f , respectively .",
    "the ejecta masses of these models are listed in table  2 .",
    "the nucleosynthesis result in model  q5 ( not presented here ) is expected to be similar to that of model  q6a , because of the resemblance of the @xmath61 profiles between these models ( figure  3 ) . as can be seen in figure  6 , a solar @xmath0-process pattern for @xmath85 is naturally reproduced in models  q6c - f , while models  q6a - b fail to reproduce the third abundance peak .",
    "this implies that the region with @xmath86 must be ejected to account for production of the third @xmath0-process peak .",
    "furthermore , to account for the solar level of thorium ( @xmath87 ) and uranium ( @xmath88 ) production , the region with rather low @xmath13 ( @xmath89 ) must be ejected .",
    "note that large deficiencies of nuclei at @xmath90 may be supplied if the slower rates of neutron capture in this region are adopted , as demonstrated by @xcite .    we find that , for models  q6c - e , the lighter @xmath0-process nuclei with @xmath91 are somewhat deficient compared to the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( figure  6c - e ) .",
    "this trend can be also seen in the observational abundance patterns of the highly @xmath0-process - enhanced , extremely metal- poor stars cs  22892 - 052 @xcite and cs",
    "31082 - 001 @xcite . in model",
    "q6f , the deficiency is outstanding because of large ejection of the low @xmath13 matter ( figure  3 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous results obtained for the neutrino wind scenario , which significantly _ overproduce _ the nuclei with @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the nuclei with @xmath91 can be supplied by slightly less energetic explosions , like models  q6a - b ( figures  5a - b ) .",
    "it is also possible to consider that these lighter @xmath0-process nuclei originate from `` neutrino winds '' in more massive supernovae ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the nuclei with @xmath91 can be produced naturally in neutrino winds with a reasonable compactness of the proto - neutron star , e.g. , @xmath94 and 10  km @xcite .",
    "figure  6 implies that the production of thorium and uranium differs from model to model , even though the abundance pattern seems to be _ universal _ between the second and third @xmath0-process peaks , as seen in models  q6c - f .",
    "this is in agreement with recent observational results suggesting that the ratio th / eu may exhibit a star - to - star scatter , while the abundance pattern between the second and third peaks is in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( honda et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "thus , the use of th / eu as a cosmochronometer should be regarded with caution , at least until the possible variations can be better quantified ; u / th might be a far more reliable chronometer , as discussed further in   5 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nucleosynthesis results obtained for models  q6c - e are in good agreement with that of the prompt explosion of a @xmath15 star with an iron core by @xcite .",
    "our results seem , however , in better agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern , in particular near the rare - earth peak ( @xmath95 ) and the third peak ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the slower ejection of the innermost region in our results owing to the reduction of pressure by electron capture , which is not taken into account in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the dynamical timescale of outgoing matter becomes significantly long during the epoch of the @xmath0-process ( @xmath97 to 1 ) , as can be seen in figure  4 .",
    "the extremely low @xmath13 ( @xmath98 ) drives matter near the neutron - drip line , where the abundance pattern deviates from the solar one . in our models , however , the solar @xmath0-process pattern is recovered by the `` freezeout effect '' after the epoch of @xmath0-processing , as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "this arises because the matter stays at higher temperatures for a longer time , hence the quasi - equilibrium between neutron emission by photodisintegration and subsequent neutron - capture processes continues to operate @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the mass of the @xmath0-processed ejecta in our results ( @xmath99 ) is more than one order of magnitude larger than that obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath100 ) .",
    "this is also a consequence of the longer dynamical timescale of outgoing ejecta in our simulation .",
    "the @xmath7 particles are mostly consumed prior to the @xmath0-process phase in our calculations , whereas they dominate the final nucleosynthesis yields in @xcite .",
    "these results strongly suggest that an accurate treatment of electron capture , as well as of neutrino transport , will be crucial to derive an accurate prediction of the @xmath0-process abundances from prompt explosions of o - ne - mg cores .",
    "we have demonstrated in the previous section that , if stars of @xmath1 do explode energetically , the solar @xmath0-process pattern can be reproduced quite naturally .",
    "it is of importance , however , to see if the nucleosynthetic material contributed to the galaxy from such stars is consistent with the currently observed elemental abundances in the solar neighborhood .",
    "figure  7 shows the `` production factors '' per supernova for model  q6e , defined for each nuclide as the final mass fraction , @xmath101 , diluted by the total ejected mass ( @xmath102 ) from the @xmath17 star , divided by its solar abundance @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the solid lines connect isotopes of a given element ( after nuclear decay ) .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines indicate a `` normalization band '' between the largest production factor ( @xmath104xe ) and that by a factor of ten less than that , along with a median value ( dashed line ) . this band is taken to be representative of the uncertainty in the nuclear data for very neutron - rich nuclei @xcite . as can be seen in figure  7 , a majority of the nuclei with @xmath105 fall within the normalization band ( except for the large deficiencies near @xmath106 ) , which is regarded to be the dominant species produced .",
    "the deficiencies near @xmath107 , and 208 may be supplied by @xmath108-process contributions from other sources .",
    "although such a supernova might be considered a likely production site of @xmath0-process nuclei , its contribution to nuclei with @xmath109 , including the @xmath7 elements and iron - peak species , is negligible .",
    "one of the essential questions raised by previous works is that , if prompt supernova explosions are one of the major sites of @xmath0-process nuclei , would in fact the @xmath0-process nuclei be significantly _ overproduced _ @xcite .",
    "as far as the explosion is purely hydrodynamical , a highly neutronized deeper region must be ejected in order for a successful @xmath0-process to result .",
    "it seems inevitable , therefore , that one must avoid an ejection of large amounts of @xmath0-process matter , at least when assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "our result shows that more than @xmath110 of the @xmath0-process matter ( @xmath111 ) is ejected per event , which reproduces the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( models  q6c - f in table  2 ) .",
    "this is about three orders of magnitude larger than the @xmath112 in the neutrino - heated supernova ejecta from a @xmath113 star obtained by @xcite .",
    "this value might would be reduced to some extent by @xmath7-rich freezeout in faster outgoing mass shells than ours as observed in @xcite .",
    "however , good agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern would not be achieved in the ejecta expanding too fast , as discussed in   3 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , production factors must be on the order of @xmath114 for the case that all supernovae contribute equally to @xmath0-process production in the galaxy .",
    "stars of @xmath1 would account for @xmath115 of all supernovae ( if they explode ) .",
    "the ejected masses ( @xmath116 ) are smaller than a factor of two to three than those from more massive supernovae .",
    "thus , production factors of @xmath117 are allowed in the case that all @xmath1 stars contribute equally to the galactic @xmath0-process material .",
    "the production factors in our results are , however , about three orders of magnitude higher than this ( figure  7 ) .    it might be argued that this type of event is extremely rare , accounting for only @xmath118 of all core - collapse supernovae .",
    "however , observations of extremely metal - poor stars ( @xmath119 } \\sim -3 $ ] ) in the galactic halo show that at least two , cs  22892 - 052 and cs  31082 - 001 , out of about a hundred studied at high resolution , imply contributions from highly @xmath0-process - enhanced supernova ejecta @xcite .",
    "moreover , such an extremely rare event would result in a much larger dispersion of @xmath0-process elements relative to iron than is currently observed amongst extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the observed star - to - star dispersion of @xmath120}$ ] over a range @xmath121 to 2 dex , was reproduced by their chemical evolution model if eu originated from stars of @xmath1 .",
    "recent abundance measurements of eu in a few extremely metal - poor stars with @xmath122 } \\lesssim -3 $ ] by subaru / hds further supports their result ( ishimaru et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the requisite mass of eu in their model is @xmath123 per event .",
    "the ejected mass of eu in our result is more than two orders of magnitude larger ( table  2 ) .    in order to resolve this conflict",
    ", we propose that the `` mixing - fallback '' mechanism operates in this kind of supernova .",
    "the peculiar abundance patterns of some extremely iron - deficient stars , including he  0107 - 5240 with @xmath124 = - 5.3 $ ] @xcite , is explained successfully with this mechanism , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "if a substantial amount of the hydrogen and helium envelope remains at the onset of the explosion , the outgoing ejecta may undergo large - scale mixing by rayleigh - taylor instabilities , which is believed to have happened in sn1987a @xcite .",
    "thus a tiny amount , say , @xmath125 , of the @xmath0-process material is mixed into the outer layers and then ejected , but most of the core material may fall back onto the proto - neutron star via the reverse shock arising from the hydrogen - helium layer interface . in this case",
    ", the typical mass of the proto - neutron star ( @xmath53 ) is recovered .",
    "an asymmetric explosion mechanism , such as that which might arise from rotating cores , may have a similar effect as the ejection of deep - interior material in a small amount @xcite .",
    "this `` mixing - fallback '' scenario must be further tested by detailed multidimensional - hydrodynamic studies .",
    "however , it may provide us with a new paradigm for the nature of supernova nucleosynthesis .",
    "this type of event may be characterized as a `` faint '' supernova , owing to the weakened explosion energy as well as the reduced amount of @xmath126ni by `` mixing - fallback '' .",
    "in addition , its ejecta consists mostly of hydrogen and helium with a higher ratio of he / h than that in the solar system .",
    "this event can be easily distinguished from the core - collapse supernovae of iron cores resulted from stars of @xmath93 , which are characterized by abundant @xmath7-elements .",
    "it is interesting to note that such an explosion bears a close resemblance to the crab supernova , sn1054 @xcite .",
    "there is the possibility , therefore , that direct evidence will be obtained from the crab nebula ( or other similar supernova remnants ) through the detection of @xmath0-process elements by future observations @xcite .",
    "detection of the @xmath127-ray lines from decays of radioactive isotopes produced by the @xmath0-process could provide additional direct evidence for this scenario @xcite .",
    "it is of special importance to confirm , from spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo , that the @xmath0-process elements are _ not _ associated with the production of @xmath7- and iron - peak elements @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the @xmath0-process enrichment in extremely metal - poor stars hd  115444 , hd  122563 , and cs  31082 - 001 is independent of the production of the elements from na to zn ( including @xmath7- and iron - peak elements ) .",
    "the abundances of na - zn among these stars are mostly the same , while the level of @xmath0-process enhancement differs from star to star .",
    "these authors take this as evidence that the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei originated from aics or type  ii supernovae from @xmath128 stars , although they prefer aics for the @xmath0-process site .",
    "note that the nucleosynthetic outcome of an aic event may be similar to the collapsing o - ne - mg core resulting from a single @xmath1 star .",
    "hence , it is possible that aics also undergo prompt explosions .",
    "the frequency of the aic events in the galaxy is expected to be very small , @xmath129  yr@xmath130 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the frequency of the core - collapse supernovae in the galaxy is @xmath131  yr@xmath130 @xcite , the production factor per aic event is @xmath132 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with our result of @xmath133 , as can be seen in figure  7 . in the case of aics",
    ", however , there is no chance to undergo `` mixing - fallback '' , owing to the absence of the outer envelope .",
    "thus , a much larger dispersion of [ eu / fe ] than that observed in the extremely metal - poor stars seems difficult to avoid .",
    "we consider , therefore , that the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei originate from @xmath128 stars discussed in this study , being independent of whether they are single stars or are in binary systems .",
    "the lighter @xmath0-process elements ( @xmath134 ) observed in extremely metal - poor stars may represent simply the interstellar medium from which these stars were formed , which originated from , perhaps , `` neutrino winds '' in supernovae from stars of @xmath135 .",
    "the observed abundances of eu relative to iron in extremely metal - poor stars are in fact well reproduced with this assumption in the chemical evolution model by @xcite .",
    "future spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars may be able to distinguish the scenario suggested in this study from aics , for example , through observations of @xmath108-process abundances originating from mass transfer in binary systems .",
    "the recently discovered @xmath0-process - enhanced , extremely metal - poor star , cs  31082 - 001 ( @xmath122 } = -2.9 $ ] ) has provided a new , potentially quite powerful cosmochronometer , uranium @xcite .",
    "@xcite have determined the age of this star ( more precisely , the time that has passed since the production event of the @xmath0-process species incorporated into this star ) using the u - th chronometer pair to be @xmath136  gyr , based on the neutrino wind scenario .",
    "this is regarded as a hard lower limit of the age of the universe , and is in good agreement with that derived by an site - independent approach @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to examine if the same age of this star is also obtained , based on the prompt explosion model of a @xmath17 star described in the previous sections .",
    "note that the same mass formula @xcite as in @xcite is used in this study for comparison .    in figure  8 the available spectroscopic abundance data for cs  31082 - 001 ( dots )",
    "are compared with the nucleosynthesis result of model  q6e discussed in   3 ( thick line ) and with the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( thin line ) , scaled at eu ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the data for the neutron - capture elements in this star are taken from @xcite .",
    "an overall agreement of our result with the spectroscopic data up to lead ( @xmath138 ) can be seen , although our result appears somewhat deficient for the lighter elements .",
    "this is in contrast to the results in neutrino winds @xcite , in which the lighter elements are significantly overproduced .",
    "thus , this model might be a reasonable one for the @xmath0-process events that produce large amounts of thorium and uranium , and whose products now appear in the atmosphere of cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "figure  9 shows the mass - integrated abundance ratios of th / eu ( open squares ) and u / th ( open circles ) from the surface to the mass point @xmath46 , as well as the inferred ages of cs  31082 - 001 , @xmath139 ( filled squares ) and @xmath140 ( filled circles ) . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", the age of cs  31082 - 001 can be inferred by application of the following relations : @xmath141\\ { \\rm gyr } \\\\ t^ * ( { { \\rm u / th } } ) & = &   21.76\\ , [ \\log ( { \\rm u / th})_0 - \\log ( { \\rm u / th})_{\\rm now}]\\ { \\rm gyr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the half lives of @xmath142th ( 14.05 gyr ) and @xmath143u ( 4.468 gyr ) , and the subscripts `` 0 '' and `` now '' denote the initial and current values derived by theory and observation , respectively . in principle , @xmath144 may serve as a more precise chronometer than @xmath145 , owing to the smaller coefficients in front of equations  ( 2 ) .",
    "moreover , the ratio u / th is less dependent on the model parameter @xmath46 , since these species are separated by only two units in atomic number .",
    "note that @xmath146u is assumed to have @xmath7-decayed away because of its relatively short half life ( 0.704 gyr ) .    as can be seen in figure  9 , u / th approaches a constant value ( @xmath147 ) for @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) , while th / eu varies widely . as a result ,",
    "the age of cs  31082 - 001 determined by u / th results in a constant value , @xmath150  gyr , for @xmath151 .",
    "the age @xmath152 is sensitive to the parameter @xmath153 , ranging from a negative age to 23.8  gyr , which illustrates that caution must be used in the application of this chronometer pair .",
    "it is useful , however , to take @xmath152 as a constraint on the model parameter @xmath153 , although the result might be changed if one includes an accurate neutrino transport and other input physics .",
    "it is found that the models with @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( zone numbers 105 and 118 , respectively ) give the same ages between @xmath152 and @xmath144 .",
    "the former corresponds to model  q6e , which would provide a consistent scenario for the origin of the @xmath0-process elements in cs  31082 - 001 , as can be seen in figure  8 .",
    "it should be noted that the fission fragments in model  q6e account for 23% of the mass contained in @xmath156 nuclei ( the last column in table  2 ) , whose contribution to the abundance pattern is neglected in this study .",
    "obviously , more accurate treatment of fission reactions is needed .",
    "nevertheless , the age @xmath144 would not be altered significantly by this improvement , since the ratio u / th is at the saturated value ( @xmath147 ) at @xmath157 , where the mass fraction of fission fragments is only 2% .",
    "it is noteworthy that the inferred age by u / th in this study is the same as the result in @xcite , which is based on a different astrophysical scenario ( neutrino winds ) , but uses the same nuclear mass formula @xcite .",
    "our result confirms the robustness of the age determination using the u - th chronometer pair , which is mostly independent of the astrophysical conditions considered . rather than the @xmath0-process site ,",
    "the nuclear mass formulae adopted , as well as the treatment of fission are crucial as far as the u - th pair is concerned @xcite .",
    "we have examined the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis obtained in the prompt explosion arising from the collapse of a @xmath17 star with an o - ne - mg core .",
    "the core collapse and subsequent core bounce were simulated with a one - dimensional , implicit , lagrangian hydrodynamic code with newtonian gravity .",
    "neutrino transport was neglected for simplicity .",
    "we obtained a very weak explosion ( model  q0 ) with an explosion energy of @xmath158  ergs , and an ejected mass of @xmath159 .",
    "no @xmath0-processing occurred in this model , because of the high electron fraction ( @xmath160 ) with low entropy ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we further simulated energetic explosions by an artificial enhancement of the shock - heating energy , which might be expected from calculations with other sets of input physics , as well as with other pre - supernova models .",
    "this resulted in an explosion energy of @xmath64  ergs and an ejected mass of @xmath161 .",
    "highly neutronized matter ( @xmath162 ) was ejected , which led to strong @xmath0-processing ( model  q6 ) .",
    "material arising from @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis was calculated with a nuclear reaction network code containing @xmath163 isotopes with all relevant reactions .",
    "the result was in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern , in particular for nuclei with @xmath164 .",
    "some of lighter @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath91 ) were deficient , which is consistent with the abundance patterns of the highly @xmath0-process enhanced , extremely metal - poor stars cs  22892 - 052 and cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "this implies that the lighter @xmath0-process nuclei may originate from another site , which we suggest might be associated with the `` neutrino wind '' in core - collapsing supernovae of iron cores resulted from more massive stars ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the large ejection of @xmath0-process material ( @xmath99 per event ) conflicts with the level of dispersion of @xmath0-process elements relative to iron observed in extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that only a small fraction ( @xmath165 ) of the @xmath0-processed material is ejected , while the bulk of such material falls back onto the proto - neutron star by the `` mixing - fallback '' mechanism .    the age of the highly @xmath0-process enhanced , extremely metal - poor star , cs  31082 - 001 was derived by application of the u - th chronometer pair , and can be regarded as a hard lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "the age obtained is @xmath4  gyr",
    "( the quoted error only includes that arising from the observations ) , the same as that based on a different astrophysical site , the neutrino - wind scenario @xcite , using the same nuclear mass formula .",
    "this confirms that the age determined by the u - th pair is mostly independent of the astrophysical environment considered .",
    "the dependence of age dating on different nuclear mass formulae , based on the prompt explosion scenario presented in this paper , will be reported in future work .",
    "it is obvious that more studies , including an accurate treatment of neutrino transport and other input physics , as well as multi - dimensional simulations of prompt supernova explosions , are needed to derive the final conclusion on the @xmath0-process scenario presented in this study . nevertheless , this scenario is attractive as a promising site of the @xmath0-process , since the solar @xmath0-process pattern can be naturally reproduced without the problematic overproduction of @xmath166 that appeared in the neutrino wind scenario .",
    "this type of event is characterized with the absence of @xmath7- and iron - peak elements , which can be easily distinguished from that of the core - collapsing iron core resulted from a more massive star ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "future spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo will reveal if the collapsing o - ne - mg cores of @xmath1 stars are a viable site for the production of @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "improved observational determination of the u / th ratio in cs  31082 - 001 , as is presently being pursued , as well as a measured abundance of pb in this star ( as is being obtained with the hubble space telescope ) , and the identification of a greater number of highly r - process - enhanced , metal - poor stars , also underway , will surely deepen our understanding of the relevant processes involved .",

    "<S> we propose , therefore , that only a small fraction of @xmath0-process material is ejected , owing to the `` mixing - fallback '' mechanism of the core matter , wherein most of the @xmath0-process material falls back onto the proto - neutron star .    </S>",
    "<S> a lower limit on the age of the universe is derived by application of the u - th chronometer pair by comparison with the observed ratio of these species in the highly @xmath0-process enhanced , extremely metal - poor star cs  31082 - 001 . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred age is @xmath4  gyr  the same as that obtained previously based on the neutrino wind scenario with the same nuclear mass formula . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that chronometric estimates obtained using the u - th pair are independent of the astrophysical conditions considered . </S>"
