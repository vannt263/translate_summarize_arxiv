    "photometric studies have revealed complex structure in the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of galactic globular clusters ( e.g. , see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the subgiant branch region is of particular interest because differences in the luminosity of stars at this evolutionary stage require distinct ages and/or chemical compositions .",
    "any globular cluster that exhibits a broadened or split subgiant branch must therefore have experienced a complex , and likely prolonged , chemical enrichment history when compared to globular clusters with a single subgiant branch population .    @xmath9 centauri and m22 ( ngc 6656 ) are two galactic globular clusters with multiple subgiant branches ( e.g. , @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) . these two clusters are also notable for exhibiting a large star - to - star dispersion in the abundance of fe - peak and neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 1851 is another globular cluster with multiple subgiant branches @xcite .",
    "although the difference in metallicity between the two populations , @xmath10[fe / h ]  @xmath2  0.07  dex @xcite , is less pronounced in ngc 1851 compared to @xmath9 cen and m22 , a large star - to - star dispersion in the neutron - capture element abundances is also present ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while theoretical studies indicate that multiple population globular clusters could be formed through mergers or that some may be the remnants of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , understanding the sequence of events that produce multiple population globular clusters remains a major challenge ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important step in advancing our knowledge of the formation of multiple population globular clusters is to understand the full range of phenomena and relative frequency present in the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "@xcite identified five new galactic globular clusters with broadened or split subgiant branches based on @xmath11  photometry .",
    "their sample included m2 ( ngc 7089 ) , a little - studied cluster .",
    "@xcite measured the strengths of the cn and ch molecular features in a sample of 19 m2 red giants .",
    "in addition to the usual bimodal distribution of cn band strengths @xcite , they noted that two objects are ch stars .",
    "ch stars are rare in globular clusters , and at the time of that paper , the only other clusters known to contain ch stars included the apparently normal cluster m55 as well as the peculiar systems m22 and @xmath9 cen .",
    "@xcite studied the cn and ch bands from sloan digital sky survey spectroscopy in a number of globular clusters including m2 .",
    "they did not identify any stars with unusually strong cn or ch in this cluster , and all of their program stars lie on the canonical red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "@xcite studied the cn and ch band strengths as well as the c and n abundances in a sample of 35 m2 red giants .",
    "they also noted the presence of an additional rgb in the @xmath12 versus @xmath13 cmd .",
    "both ch stars identified by @xcite are located on the anomalous rgb ( see figure 14 in @xcite ) .",
    "examination of the @xcite str \" omgrenphotometry also confirms the peculiar nature of the rgb . while @xcite did not observe any stars on the anomalous rgb , in a subsequent study they obtained spectra for such stars @xcite .",
    "stars belonging to the two rgbs had distinct c , n , sr and ba abundances and @xcite argued that m2 has experienced a complex star formation history with similarities to @xmath9 cen , m22 and ngc 1851 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy and chemical abundance measurements for a larger suite of elements for stars on the canonical and anomalous rgbs of m2 are essential to reveal the true nature of this multiple population globular cluster .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to measure cn and ch indices and chemical abundances for a sample of stars in m2 belonging to the canonical and anomalous rgbs .",
    "the sample selection and observations are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the analysis .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 includes a discussion on the nature of this cluster .",
    "the program stars were selected from the @xmath14 str \" omgren  photometry by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd100 ] , we present the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 cmds . as noted by @xcite , we confirm the presence of an additional rgb sequence .",
    "such stars are highlighted in red and aqua in figure [ fig : cmd100 ] and were selected from the @xmath18 versus @xmath15 cmd ( upper panel in figure [ fig : cmd100 ] ) .",
    "we refer to these as anomalous rgb stars .",
    "( the reason for using two sets of colours for the anomalous rgb stars will become clear when we present the chemical abundances for these objects : the red symbols are stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath31.5 and the aqua symbols are stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath31.0 . ) while @xcite showed that the two ch stars identified by @xcite were located on the anomalous giant branch , neither was included in the @xcite photometry .     versus @xmath15 ( upper ) , @xmath19 versus @xmath16 ( middle ) and @xmath19 versus @xmath17 ( lower ) .",
    "the black symbols are stars that lie on the canonical rgb , agb or hb as well as one uv bright object .",
    "the red ( and aqua ) symbols are stars that lie on the anomalous rgb , and were selected from the @xmath18 versus @xmath15 cmd , upper panel .",
    "( the aqua symbols are the unusually metal - rich objects as determined from high - resolution spectroscopy . )",
    "crosses represent stars observed with the aat .",
    "square symbols ( subaru telescope ) and diamond symbols ( magellan telescope ) represent objects observed at high spectral resolution .",
    "[ fig : cmd100 ] ]      we observed candidate m2 members using the aaomega multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the anglo - australian telescope as part of two separate observing runs .",
    "the two ch stars from @xcite were also observed .",
    "the first set of observations , obtained on 2010 september 30 , used the 1700b blue and 2000r red gratings .",
    "these provide spectral coverage of 3750 to 4440 and 5800 to 6300 at resolutions",
    "@xmath20 = @xmath21/@xmath22 = 3500 and 8000 for the red and blue arms , respectively .",
    "the second set of observations , from 2011 november 1 , employed the 580v blue and 1700d red gratings .",
    "these gratings provide a wavelength coverage from 3750 to 5500 at a resolution of 1300 in the blue arm , and 8350 to 8825 at @xmath20 = 10000 in the red arm . in each case",
    "the cluster observations were obtained together with flat - field and arc lamp calibration exposures .",
    "data reduction to wavelength - calibrated sky - subtracted individual stellar spectra was accomplished using the standard 2dfdr software . in generating the fibre configurations for the observations ,",
    "high priority was given to the stars that lie on the anomalous giant branch .",
    "although the same input catalogue was used for both sets of observations , the combination of different field plates and different available fibre numbers meant that the two sets of stars observed are not identical .",
    "the first set contains 22 stars , the second 23 with 11 in common for a total sample of 34 candidate m2 members .",
    "the stars observed are listed in table [ tab : aao ] .",
    "we note that 14 stars belong to the anomalous rgb and the two ch stars from @xcite may also be regarded as anomalous rgb objects @xcite .",
    "based on their cmd location , we offer some comments on a handful of the stars observed with aaomega .",
    "star nr 82 , if a cluster member , would be classified as a asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star rather than a rgb star .",
    "star nr 184 , if a cluster member , would be a uv - bright object lying more than a magnitude above the cluster blue horizontal branch .",
    "similarly , star nr  648 has the photometric colours and magnitude of a cluster blue horizontal branch star .",
    "however , the aaomega spectra ( from the second data set ) are that of a cluster - like red giant star .",
    "we have no straightforward explanation for this anomaly .",
    "star nr 707 , again if it is a cluster member , has a magnitude and colour that would suggest it is a red horizontal branch ( rhb ) star .",
    "m2 , however , is not normally considered to have a rhb population given its dominant blue hb morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have not considered these stars any further in the analysis .",

    "in sharp contrast , however , the elements from 56 @xmath35 @xmath50 @xmath35 72 ( i.e. , ba to hf ) exhibit identical gradients within their mutual uncertainties .",
    "for these elements , the measured abundance differences in each system are consistent with a single relation .",

    "these include elements at the first ( sr , y , zr ) and second ( ba , la , ce , pr , nd )  peaks ; pb is the sole representative of the third  peak . similarly , [ @xmath56/@xmath57 ]  @xmath62  [ @xmath56/fe ]  @xmath3  [ @xmath57/fe ]",

    "uncertainties on these ratios are typically 0.1@xmath30.2  dex .",
    "these ratios and indices are largely insensitive to uncertainties in the atomic data and non - lte effects . for [ pb / la ] , m2 exhibits a higher ratio than m22 and m4 @xmath3 m5 . for [ @xmath56/@xmath57 ] , m4 @xmath3",
    "m5 exhibits lower ratios than m22 and m2 , although this may reflect the higher metallicity of m4 and m5 relative to the other two clusters . for [ pb/@xmath56 ]",
    ", m2 exhibits a higher ratio than the other two systems .",
    "a number of studies have investigated  nucleosynthesis in metal - poor stars on the agb ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* fishlock et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "while most of these models fail to offer an exact match for the metallicity of m2 , we can use them to get a sense of  nucleosynthesis ratios predicted for metallicities higher and lower than m2 .",
    "we find encouraging agreement when comparing our results to the [ @xmath56/@xmath57 ] and [ pb/@xmath56 ] indices presented in figures  c3 and c5 of @xcite for 3 and 5  m@xmath68  agb stars at the appropriate metallicities for m2 , m22 and m4 @xmath3 m5 .",
    "furthermore , we note that the yields of fishlock et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for their 3  m@xmath68  and 3.5  m@xmath68  models for [ fe / h ] = @xmath31.2 bracket the [ pb / la]@xmath63 , [ @xmath56/@xmath57]@xmath63 and [ pb/@xmath56]@xmath63 ratios in m2 , m22 and m4 @xmath3 m5 .",
    "quantitative chemical evolution models based on their yields would be of great interest .",
    "overall , we reach the same conclusion drawn by @xcite : agb stars with masses less than 3  m@xmath68  can not reproduce the observed ratios unless the standard @xmath69c pocket efficiency in the models is reduced by factors of 30 or more .",
    "if we assume that the stars in the @xmath7 group in m2 formed later than the stars in the @xmath8-only group , and that the agb stars responsible for distributing this  material in m2 formed simultaneously with the stars in the @xmath8-only group , this sets an upper limit on the amount of time that passed between the formation of the @xmath8-only group and the @xmath7 group . for a 3  m@xmath68  agb star , adopting the approximate stellar lifetimes computed by @xcite ,",
    "this sets a limit of no more than 300  myr or so between the two groups . of course",
    ", this limit would be even smaller if higher - mass agb stars were the source of the  material .",
    "finally , although we have focused on the neutron - capture elements , the difference in [ fe / h ] between the @xmath8-only and @xmath7 groups requires some source(s ) that produces the elements from si to zn ( and perhaps other elements ) to increase the abundances of these elements between these groups .",
    "in this paper we present a spectroscopic analysis of giant stars in the multiple population globular cluster m2 .",
    "our principal and novel results include the following .",
    "first , we identify a star - to - star dispersion in iron abundance with the anomalous rgb stars ( i.e. , stars lying redward of the dominant rgb ) being more metal - rich than the canonical rgb objects .",
    "the iron abundance distribution has a dominant peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath31.7 and smaller peaks at @xmath31.5 and @xmath31.0 , although membership for the latter group remains to be established .",
    "secondly , the neutron - capture element abundances exhibit a star - to - star dispersion with a possible bimodal distribution . in this",
    "regard , m2 is chemically similar to the globular clusters m22 , ngc 1851 and @xmath9 cen , whose subgiant branches exhibit multiple sequences .",
    "it is likely that m2 has therefore experienced a similarly complex formation history .",
    "thirdly , when subtracting the average abundances in the @xmath8-only group from those of the @xmath7 group , the abundance residual exhibits a striking correlation with the fraction of each element attributed to the @xmath6-process in solar system material .",
    "this residual is remarkably similar to that found in m22 and in m4 @xmath3 m5 .",
    "such a similarity would indicate that m2 , m22 , and m4 were enriched by @xmath6-process material of identical composition and potentially offers important observational constraints on the nature of the @xmath6-process in low metallicity environments .",
    "a comparison with theoretical predictions reveals that agb stars with masses less than 3 m@xmath68  are unlikely to have played a major role in the chemical enrichment of m2 .",
    "in addition to the agb star contribution , some source(s ) is needed to increase the abundances of the elements from si to zn in the @xmath7 group relative to the @xmath8-only group .",
    "additional studies are essential to understand the formation and evolution of this complex cluster .",
