    "if massive black holes ( mbhs ) are ubiquitous in galaxy spheroids and galaxies experience multiple mergers during their cosmic assembly , mbh _ binaries _ ( mbhbs hereon ) should be common , albeit transient features of galactic bulges .",

    "mbhbs can coalesce shortly , and a clear prediction of general relativity is that the relic mbh receives a kick in response to the asymmetric pattern of gravitational waves emitted just prior coalescence . for slowly spinning mbhs",
    "recoil velocities of a few @xmath3 km s@xmath0 were predicted , but recent numerical advances in general relativity have indicated that velocities as extreme as @xmath4 km s@xmath0 can be attained for maximally rotating kerr mbhs with spin vectors lying in the orbital plane ( schnittman & buonanno 2007 ; lousto & zlochower and references therein ) .",
    "these velocities far exceed the escape speed even from the brightest galaxies and for this reason mbhs receding from their parent host have been considered as electromagnetic targets of a coalescence event ( devecchi et al .",

    "recently , the quasar sdss j092712.65 + 294344.0 ( hereafter sdssj0927 ; adelman  mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) has been considered as first candidate of a recoiling mbh by komossa , zhou & lu ( 2008 , kzl ) .",
    "sdssj0927 exhibits , in its optical spectrum , two distinct sets of lines offset by 2650 km s@xmath0 relative to each other .",
    "the first set of narrow emission lines ( nels ) has redshift @xmath5 ( identified by kzl as the redshift of the galaxy that hosted the mbh at its birth ) .",
    "we will refer to this set that is typical of an agn as rest - frame nels ( rf  nels hereon ; the red nels in kzl ) . the rf ",
    "nels do not show any evidence of ionization stratification ( as in few other quasars ) , possibly because these lines are not resolved in the sdss spectrum .",
    "the second set of lines comprises two blue  shifted systems featuring different fwhm : the broad mg ii and balmer emission lines ( b  bels hereon ) with fwhm @xmath6 km s@xmath0 , and the high - ionization narrow lines ( b  nels ) with fwhm @xmath7 km s@xmath0 , both consistent with a redshift @xmath8 .",

    "nels remains problematic for the reasons explained in section  [ sec : prob ] .",
    "the aim of this letter is to suggest an alternative interpretation to sdssj0927 : that sdssj0927 is an unequal  mass mbhb embedded in a circumbinary gaseous disc at the centre of its host galaxy . in section  [ sec : model ] and",
    "[ sec : orb ] we describe the main properties of the model that are requested to reproduce the observed properties of b  bels . in section  [ sec : gap ] we discuss the possible origin of b  nels and of their doppler shift . in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the origin of the b  nels and the likelihood of observing a recoiling mbh with a speed close to its maximum are the main concern of this section .",
    "first , we notice that the recoil hypothesis by kzl seems unable to explain all properties of the b  nels observed in sdssj0927 .",
    "the fwhm of the b ",
    "nels is larger than the fwhm of the rf  nels and of typical fwhms of nels observed in agns .",
    "by contrast , the fwhm of b  nels is not large enough to assure that the emitting gas is bound to the recoiling mbh , although this should be the case as the b - nels have the same doppler shift as the b - bels .",
    "kzl suggest that the b  nels are emitted by gas shocked in the interaction of the mbh with the interstellar medium . in this case however , there is no reason why the speed of the shocked gas should equal that of the mbh ( devecchi et al .",
    "alternatively , kzl consider that b ",
    "nels are emitted in the outer part of the accretion disc with substantial radial spreading and/or in an unspecified kind of outflow .",
    "this last possibility was discussed in details by bogdanovic et al .",
    "they find that mass outflows strongly reduce the density of the inner regions of the accretion disc implying a low rate of gas accretion onto the mbh . in this case",

    "no recoil with @xmath12 is possible for mbh spin parameters @xmath13.,height=7 ]    second , we remark that the probability of observing an ejected mbh with the properties of sdssj0927 depends sensitively on the specific frequency associated to mbhb mergers able to form a remnant with the required large mass ( @xmath14 ) , and on the probability for the remnant to receive such a high recoil velocity , i.e. @xmath15 km s@xmath0 ( we conservatively adopt this lower limit to the recoil velocity , which provides an upper limit to the detection probability ) .",
    "the latter constraint strongly depends on the mbh spin magnitudes and orientations with respect to the orbital plane , and on the mass ratio of the binary , @xmath16 as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . we model the recoil using the two available fits to the recoil velocity based on the latest numerical relativity results ( lousto & zlochower 2009 ) .",
    "non - spinning holes always recoil with velocities below 200@xmath17 , and the recoil increases with increasing spin . in general",
    "the recoil is maximized for spin vectors lying in the orbital plane .",
    "we can estimate the probability of detection of an ejection with @xmath10 by convolving the probability of large recoils ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) with the merger rate of mbhbs . we can compute the number of mbh coalescences observable across the entire sky , based on the merger rates by volonteri , haardt & madau ( 2003 ; volonteri & madau 2008 ) . for a statistical sample of mbh mergers ,",
    "our models provide the masses of the merging mbhs and the redshift of the event .",
    "we select coalescences in the redshift range @xmath18 ( compatible with the redshift of sdssj0927 ) , further imposing a total binary mass @xmath19 ( i.e. the mass of the hypothetical recoiling mbh as discussed in kzl2008 ) .",
    "marginalising over mbh masses and q , the highest rate of successful recoils , @xmath10 , is found by imposing maximal values for the dimensionless spin parameters , @xmath20 for both holes ; the spins initially lie in the orbital plane pointing in opposite directions .",
    "the rate is @xmath21 yr@xmath0 .",
    "the requirement that the b - nels come from a spreading accretion disc however implies @xmath22 .",
    "for these masses , the rate of events with @xmath10 decreases by one order of magnitude .",
    "this set of assumptions , maximizing the recoil over the orbital parameters , is mostly dependent on the mass ratio @xmath23 we need mass ratios @xmath24 to obtain recoils above @xmath25 .",
    "equal mass mergers are however rare ( e.g. , volonteri & madau 2008 ; sesana et al . 2005 ) ; the distribution of mass ratios for @xmath26 m@xmath27 at @xmath18 peaks at @xmath28 and decreases steeply at larger @xmath11 .",
    "assuming mbhs with equal spins , @xmath29 , isotropically distributed , and @xmath19 , the expected rate decreases to less than @xmath30 yr@xmath0 .",
    "the rate of ejections decreases drastically with decreasing spin magnitude , and it is zero for any orbital  spin configuration if @xmath31 .",
    "in our model , sdssj0927 hosts a mbhb surrounded by a circumbinary thin disc feeding the secondary mbh . in the tidal interaction of the binary with",
    "the gas a gap , i.e. , a low density region surrounding the binary , opens .",
    "it is known that , for mbhbs with @xmath24 , @xmath32 is massive enough to perturb strongly the surrounding disc , creating over few orbital periods an annular low density region , commonly referred as `` gap '' . during this phase",
    "most of the inner disc is accreted by the primary ( syer & clarke 1995 ; ivanov et al .",
    "1999 , dotti et al .",
    "2006b ) , preventing long lasting accretion events onto @xmath33 .",
    "as shown in section 4 , in order to explain the spectrum of sdssj0927 , @xmath34 given this constraint , we expect that the tidal interaction of the binary with the viscous disc will leave @xmath33 in a state of low activity .",
    "@xmath32 , remaining in closer gravitational contact with the inner rim of the outer disc , moves at low speed relative to the higher density reservoir of gas , thus sweeping up an accretion stream that inflows from the edge of the gap .",
    "this continuous refueling supplies an accretion disc around @xmath32 , and allows for luminous accretion events during the orbital decay of @xmath32 ( hayasaki , mineshige , sudou 2007 ; cuadra et al .",

    "nels are emitted from the `` standard '' large - scale narrow line region that extends around the binary for @xmath37 kpc , while the b  bels are produced in the broad line region gravitationally bound to @xmath32 , and can be blue  shifted or red  shifted depending on the orbital phase of the secondary .",
    "the b  nels come from a region of the gap near @xmath32 , where forbidden lines are emitted because of the low density of the gas .",
    "since @xmath32 and the gas orbiting in the gap at comparable annuli are subject to the same gravitational potential of @xmath33 , both move with approximately the same keplerian velocity . accordingly , the same blue ",
    "shift for the b  bels and b  nels can be explained if @xmath32 emits an anisotropic ionizing radiation normal to the plane of the discs so that the ionizing photons interact only with the gas in the gap near @xmath32 .",
    "this is naturally achieved if , e.g. , the accretion flow around @xmath32 is a standard shakura - sunyaev accretion disc .",
    "indeed , cosine  like behaviour of the thermal ionizing flux , coupled to the small solid angle subtended by the disc assures that the ionization parameter of the gap gas not in the immediate vicinity of @xmath32 is relatively low .",
    "in this section we use some of the observed properties of sdssj0927 ( the blue  shift and the fwhm of the b  bel , and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100  ) to constrain the dynamical properties of the hypothetical mbhb .",
    "the compatibility of the model with the other observed spectral features ( in particular the blue  shift and the flux of the b  nels ) is discussed in section  [ sec : gap ] . given the large blue  shift of the observed b  nels and b  bels , corresponding to a high velocity of the accreting mbh , we assume that the active mbh is @xmath32 , the lightest hole , and that its mass is @xmath38 m@xmath27 as inferred in kzl2008 .",
    "we will further assume that the binary is moving on a ( quasi ) circular orbit .",
    "the first constraint to be verified is that the observed broad line region responsible for the b ",
    "bels is bound to @xmath32 , and is not tidally stripped by @xmath33 .",
    "this condition can be re  written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 pc ( kzl2008 ) is the radius of the blr and @xmath41 is the roche lobe radius of @xmath32 .",

    "we focus on the minimum mass of @xmath51 obtained for the largest value of @xmath52 that is fitting all the observational constraints . assuming that the unification model for agns ( urry & padovani 1995 ) remains valid for this peculiar object , the observation of the b ",
    "bels limits the maximum value of the inclination of the orbital plane to @xmath53 , which implies @xmath54 , @xmath55 pc , and @xmath56 , value consistent with the observed high mass end of the mbh mass function .",
    "these values correspond to an orbital period of @xmath57 yr . the time ",
    "scale for two mbhs in sdssj0927 to reach final coalescence due to gravitational wave emission is @xmath58 yr , shorter than the hubble time .",
    "if the binary model will be confirmed , this is proof of the existence of a dynamical process able to overcome the so called `` last parsec problem '' and drive mbhbs to the final coalescence .    using the fwhm of [ oiii ] as a tracer of the stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath59 , and assuming the @xmath60 relation ( ferrarese & ford , 2005 and references therein ) , we obtain for @xmath33 a mass @xmath61 orders of magnitude smaller than our estimate",
    "this would be in contrast with the high luminosity of sdssj0927 , which would imply extremely super eddington luminosity ( @xmath62 eddington ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the mbhb scenario , the dynamics of gas may be not representative of the galactic potential , due to the recent galaxy merger .    to estimate the likelihood of the detection of a mbhb with the properties inferred by our model",
    ", we use the same theoretical merger - tree for cosmological mbhb used in section  [ sec : prob ] .",
    "we again impose limits on the redshift range ( @xmath18 ) , but now the binary model constrains the masses of the binary members , rather than the mass of the remnant .",
    "we therefore compute the probability that an observer at @xmath63 detects binaries with @xmath64 m@xmath27 and @xmath65 m@xmath27 across the entire sky .",
    "the observable merger rate corresponds to @xmath66 binaries per year , a value 20 times larger than the expected rate of ejections obtained using the most favourable conditions for high kick velocity , as discussed in section  [ sec : prob ] .",
    "our model suggests that the b  nels are produced from the low  density gas in the gap region near @xmath32 .",
    "this assumption explains the blue  shift of these lines , as we discussed in section  [ sec : model ] . for consistency , we need to constrain the properties of the gas in the gap , and check if its physical status is consistent with the production of b  nels and with the energy flux observed at these frequencies .",
    "we assume that the gas in the gap is mostly ionized , so that we can derive the gas properties from the luminosity of the balmer lines . under the hypothesis of isotropic emission the total luminosity of",
    "the h@xmath67 line is @xmath68 where @xmath69 mpc is the luminosity distance of sdssj0927 , @xmath70 erg s@xmath0 @xmath71 is the flux of the b ",

    "we use the standard assumption that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the local sound speed of the plasma and @xmath84 is the keplerian velocity of the gas due to the potential well of @xmath33 . in this first estimate",
    "we assume @xmath85 k , that corresponds to @xmath86 . replacing this ratio in eq .",
    "[ eqn : volume ] and using eq .",
    "[ eqn : hbeta ] we obtain @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "a different estimate for @xmath75 can be obtained assuming that the vertical support of the low density gas in the gap is due to a supersonic turbulent motion of the plasma of the order of @xmath89 the average fwhm of the b  nels . in this second estimate",
    "we assume @xmath90 km s@xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath91 @xmath88 .",
    "we emphasize that these estimates must be considered as a lower limit , because the gas can be clumpy ( so that only a fraction of the irradiated gas will contribute consistently to the emission ) , and because the anisotropic radiation produced in the accretion disc of @xmath32 can irradiate less than 1/2 of the gap .",
    "both estimates of @xmath75 are much smaller than the density expected for a standard @xmath92disc around @xmath33 at @xmath93 , indicating the presence of a gap , confirming our expectations . an additional , independent constraint on @xmath75",
    "can be obtained from the flux ratios of different oxygen lines , in particular the [ oii]@xmath94 doublet and the [ oiii]@xmath95 lines ( see e.g. osterbrock & ferland 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the ratio between the two components of the [ oii ] doublet can not be employed here , since the lines are practically unresolved .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the [ oiii ] lines .",
    "since the b-[oiii]@xmath96 and the rf-[oiii]@xmath97 are blended , we assume a factor of 3 between the fluxes of the [ oiii]@xmath96 and [ oiii]@xmath97 lines in both systems ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) . we compare the observed line flux ratios to the expectations for a gas in photo - ionization equilibrium , which yields @xmath98 k. for @xmath99 k , we obtain @xmath100 @xmath88 .",
    "this density is fully consistent with the predictions from the h@xmath67 luminosity .",

    "sdssj0927 is indeed confirmed to be a peculiar system .",
    "we check our results by calculating if the production of a forbidden line such as [ oiii ] in such high density regions is self - consistent .",
    "we therefore consider the contribution of both collisional excitations and de  excitations when computing the luminosity of [ oiii ] lines .",

    "this ratio is fully consistent with standard metallicities in quasars hosts .",
    "this consideration can explain the presence of both h@xmath67 and forbidden lines , but the [ oii ] doublet .",
    "[ oii ] emission is not consistent with such high densities , because the [ oii ] critical density for collisional de - excitation is @xmath106 @xmath88 .",
    "the detection of [ oii ] lines suggests that the gap is filled with an inhomogeneous , cloudy medium .",
    "the source of this inhomogeneity may be the competition between the gas inflow from the circumbinary disc and the periodic perturbation exerted by the mbhb ( see , e.g. hayasaki , mineshige , sudou 2007 ; cuadra et al .",

    "the binary hypothesis for sdssj0927 relies on a simple set of assumptions . we can relax the assumption of circular orbits , and assume a non zero eccentricity ( @xmath111 ) , expected to be present after gap opening ( armitage & natarajan 2005 ; dotti et al . 2006a , 2007 ; cuadra et al .",
    "eccentricities of this magnitude are still compatible with the binary model .",
    "larger values are instead unlikely in sdssj0927 : if the binary has a large eccentricity and @xmath32 is near apocentre , an extremely massive @xmath33 is needed to justify such a large orbital velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "shields et al .",
    "( 2009 ) set an upper limit on the change of the doppler shift of the b - bel system ( @xmath112 km / s / year ) . in the binary scenario , this prevents @xmath32 to be caught too close to the pericentre .",
    "we note that assuming circular orbit and the set of mbhb parameters discussed above , the b - bel system moves only of 4.2 km / s over three years , corresponding to an average shift of @xmath113 km / s / year .",
    "sdssj0927 is clearly exceptional .",
    "either it is the first example of a mbh ejected from its nucleus due to the gravitational recoil , or it harbours one of the smallest separation mbhbs ever detected .",
    "only the possible binary in oj287 could have closer mbhs ( @xmath114 pc , valtonen 2007 ) .",
    "sdssj0927 would provide clear evidence that mbhbs can indeed reach coalescence in less than a hubble time , and that nature is able to solve the last - parsec problem .",
    "if the model discussed in this letter is confirmed , sdssj0927 will represent the first detection ever of emission from a circumbinary gap around a mbhb .",
    "the proof of existence of binaries with such a small orbital separation is of extreme importance for gravitational wave experiments such as lisa ( bender et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the pulsar timing arrays ( pta , sesana et al .",
    "2008 ) . since our theoretical expectations for a binary with the characteristics of sdssj0927",
