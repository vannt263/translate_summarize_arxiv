    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies within clusters of galaxies is a key tool for understanding the role of the environment on galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "the reader is referred to the seminal review by binggeli , sandage , and tammann ( 1988 ) , which is still relevant today .    in this paper , we present an analysis of the composite cluster lf based on the commissioning data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; see gunn et al . 1998 ; york et al . 2000 ; stoughton et al .",
    "this analysis has several key advantages over previous studies of the composite cluster lf , including accurate multi - color ccd photometry for all galaxies ( in optical passbands @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) , large aerial coverage , thus enabling us to make a local correction for the projected field lf , and finally , the availability of several objectively - measured galaxy properties like morphology .",
    "furthermore , we selected our clusters from the sdss cut and enhance ( ce ) cluster catalog of goto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which has two major benefits over previous cluster samples used for lf studies .",
    "first , the ce catalog was objectively constructed using the latest cluster - finding algorithms , and therefore has a well - determined selection function ( see goto et al .",
    "secondly , ce has obtained an accurate photometric redshift for each cluster based on the observed color of the e / s0 ridge - line using the method of j. annis et al .",

    "thus , our analysis of the composite cluster lf is based on one of the largest sample of clusters to date .",
    "we present this work now to provide a low - redshift benchmark for on - going multi - color photometric studies of high redshift clusters of galaxies . with the advent of large - area ccd imagers on large telescopes",
    ", the number of distant clusters with such data will increase rapidly over the next few years ; e.g. kodama et al . ( 2001 ) recently presented large - area multi - color ccd photometry for the distant cluster a 851 ( @xmath12 ) using suprime - cam on the subaru telescope .",

    "1997 for the problems associated with photographic studies of the cluster composite lf ] .",
    "for each galaxy , we used the model magnitude computed by the photo data analysis pipeline , which has been shown by lupton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to be the optimal magnitude for faint sdss galaxies .",
    "it is also close to the total magnitude for the fainter sdss galaxies . for a full discussion of the photometric data , and the galaxy parameters derived from that data , we refer the reader to lupton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the clusters used herein were drawn from the large sample of ce clusters presented in goto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which were selected over the same photometric runs of 752 & 756 .",
    "we only selected the richer systems which were determined by the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath418th magnitude , ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the ce clusters used here satisfy the following conditions :    \\1 ) number of galaxies brighter than @xmath418th magnitude in the @xmath23 band ( @xmath22 ) @xmath24 20 ,    \\2 ) 0.02@xmath250.25 .",
    "condition 1 was used to select richer systems .",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath418th magnitude in the @xmath23 band after subtracting the background using the method described in section [ method ] to construct composite lfs .",
    "galaxies within 0.75 mpc from a cluster center were used .",
    "condition 1 was used to avoid letting small groups with only a few very bright galaxies dominate the composite lfs in the weighting scheme .",
    "( the weighting scheme is explained in detail in section [ method ] . )",
    "even though we used @xmath2620 as a criteria to select our clusters , we show in section [ discussion ] that our composite lfs were not affected by this richness criteria .",
    "since the high redshift clusters ( @xmath270.3 ) are not imaged to the fainter galaxies , we restricted our clusters to be in the range 0.02@xmath250.25 . in total , 204 clusters satisfy these criteria .",
    "we discuss here the construction of the composite luminosity function of galaxies within the subsample of the ce clusters discussed above .",
    "the first critical step in such an analysis is the subtracting the background and foreground contamination . ideally , one would wish to do this via spectroscopic observations , but since the ce cluster catalog contains @xmath282000 galaxies in the region used , it is not feasible to observe all clusters spectroscopically . therefore , we must make a statistical correction based on the expected contamination from projected field galaxies .",
    "one of the main advantages of the sdss data is that such a correction can be estimated locally ( i.e. free from any galaxy number count variances due to the large - scale structure ) for each cluster since we possess all the photometric data , to the same depth and in the same filter set , well outside of the cluster .",
    "indeed , such local background subtraction was thought to be ideal in previous works , but was not possible due to the small coverage of the sky .    for the composite cluster lf",
    ", we only used galaxies within 0.75 mpc of the cluster centroid .",
    "this radius was determined empirically so as not to lose statistics by using a too small radius , and not to lose the contrast of clusters against the background by using a too large radius .",
    "foreground and background contamination were corrected for using an annulus around each cluster with an inner radius of 1.5 mpc and an outer radius of 1.68 mpc .",
    "these radii represent a compromise between having as large an aperture as possible to avoid removing legitimate cluster galaxies , while still providing an accurate estimate of the local projected field population . since the background / foreground galaxies are themselves highly clustered , it is important to obtain as local an estimate as possible .",
    "the photometric redshift of each cluster was used to convert these metric apertures into angular apertures .",
    "the center of each cluster was taken from the ce catalog , and estimated from the position of the peak in the enhanced density map of goto et al .",
    "the cluster centroids were expected to be determined with an accuracy better than @xmath2840 arcsec through monte - carlo simulation .",
    "when an annulus touches the boundary of the sdss data , we corrected for contamination using the number - magnitude relationship of the whole data set instead ( this only affected a few of the clusters used herein ) .",
    "since each sample cluster has a different redshift , each cluster reaches the sdss apparent magnitude limit at different absolute magnitudes . also ,",
    "because they have various richnesses , the number of galaxies in each cluster is different . to take these different degrees of completeness into account",
    ", we followed the methodology of colless ( 1989 ) to construct the composite cluster lf .",
    "the individual cluster lfs are weighted according to the cluster richness and the number of clusters which contribute to a given bin .",
    "this is written as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number of galaxies in the @xmath31th bin of the composite lf , @xmath32 is the number in the @xmath31th bin of the @xmath33th cluster lf , @xmath34 is the normalization of the @xmath33th cluster lf , and was measured to be the field - corrected number of galaxies brighter than @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the number of clusters contributing the @xmath31th bin and , finally , @xmath37 .",
    "the formal errors on the composite lf were computed using    @xmath38^{1/2 }    , \\ ] ]    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the errors on the @xmath31th bin for the composite and @xmath33th cluster , respectively . in this way we can take into account the different degrees of completeness .    like other authors , we discarded the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) within 0.75 mpc of the cluster centroid when constructing the composite lf , since such bcgs tend not to follow the cluster lf .",
    "we only used sdss galaxies brighter than @xmath41=21.0 , since this is the limit of the sdss star ",
    "galaxy separation ( scranton et al . 2002 ; lupton et al . 2001 ) . this magnitude limit and",
    "weighting scheme combined with our cosmology enabled us to dig lf down to @xmath42=@xmath417.5 .",
    "when converting apparent to absolute magnitudes , we assumed a k - correction for the early - type galaxy given by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : all.eps ] , we show the composite lf of the subset of ce clusters discussed above .",
    "we present one composite lf for each of the five sdss passbands .",
    "we also present in table [ tab:5color ] the best - fit parameters from a joint fit of a schechter function to these data . for a comparison",
    ", we also show the field values as derived by blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( corrected for @xmath14 = 0.7 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : all.eps ] , field lfs normalized to cluster lfs are shown by dotted lines .",
    "as expected , the @xmath2 for our cluster lfs is significantly brighter ( by 1  1.5 magnitudes depending on the bands ) than those seen for the field lfs in all five bands .",
    "furthermore , the faint end slopes ( @xmath3 ) of the cluster composite lfs are much flatter that those seen for the field lfs .",
    "this is especially noticeable for the redder passbands ( @xmath33 and @xmath1 ) while the slope of the cluster lf systematically flattens from the @xmath43 passband to the @xmath1 passband .",
    "these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cluster lf has two distinct underlying populations i.e. the bright end of the lf is dominated by bright early types that follow a gaussian - like luminosity distribution , while the faint - end of the cluster lf is a steep power - law - like function dominated by star - forming ( bluer ) galaxies .",
    "binggeli et al . (",
    "1988 ) originally suggested this hypothesis , while the recent work of adami et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , rakos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and dressler et al .",
    "1999 supported this idea .",
    "particularly , boyce et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed lf of abell 868 is made up of three different populations of galaxies ; luminous red and two fainter blue populations .",
    "the idea is illustrated by the fact that the cluster lfs in the redder passbands , which are presumably dominated by the old stellar populations of the early types , have much brighter @xmath2 s and significantly shallower slopes than those measured in the bluer passbands .",
    "those results can also be interpreted as showing that bright elliptical galaxies are more populated in dense regions , like inside of clusters . they are consistent with the morphology - density relation advocated by dressler et al .",
    "( 1980 , 1997 ) .",
    "one of the key aspects of the sdss photometric data is the opportunity to statistically study the distribution of galaxies as a function of their morphology . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the composite cluster lf as a function of morphology using three complementary methods for determining the morphological type of each galaxy .",
    "these include : i ) the best - fit de vaucouleur or exponential model profile ; ii ) the inverse of concentration index and iii ) the @xmath8 color of the galaxies .",
    "we present all three methods , since at present it is unclear which method is the most successful at separating the different morphological galaxy types .",
    "also , each method suffers from different levels of contamination , and the differences in the methods can be used to gauge the possible systematic uncertainties in the morphological classifications .",
    "we discuss the three methods used in detail below .",
    "the first method we consider here is using the de vaucouleur and exponential model fits of the galaxy light profiles measured by sdss photometric pipeline ( @xmath44 r.h .",
    "lupton et al . , in preparation ) to broadly separate galaxies into the late and early - type .",
    "if the likelihood of a de vaucouleur model fit to the data is higher than the that of an exponential model fit , the galaxy is called a late - type , and vice versa . galaxies that have the same likelihoods for both model fits are discarded . in figure",
    "[ fig : exp_dev.ps ] , we present the composite cluster lf of late - type and early - type galaxies ( as defined using the model fits above ) for all five sdss passbands . in table",
    "[ tab : dev_exp ] , we present the best - fit schechter function parameters to these data , and show the fits in figure [ fig : exp_dev.ps ] .",
    "the second method uses the inverse of the concentration index , which is defined as @xmath45 = @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radius that contains 50% of the petrosian flux and @xmath48 is the radius that contains 90% of the petrosian flux ( see r.h .",
    "lupton et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "both of these parameters are measured by the sdss photo analysis pipeline for each galaxy .",
    "the concentration parameter used here ( @xmath45 ) is just the inverse of the commonly used concentration parameter , and thus early - type galaxies have a lower @xmath45 parameter than late - type galaxies .",
    "the correlation of @xmath45 with visually - classified morphologies has been studied in detail by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and strateva et al .",
    "they found that galaxies with @xmath490.4 are regarded as early - type galaxies , while galaxies with @xmath500.4 are regarded as late - type galaxies .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig : cin.ps ] , we show the composite cluster lf of late - type and early - type galaxies as defined using this second method for all five sdss passbands . in table",
    "[ tab:5color_cin ] , we present the best - fit schechter function parameters to these data .",
    "the third method used herein for morphological classification was to use the observed @xmath8 color of the galaxy which has been proposed by strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . using the fact that k - correction for @xmath8 is almost constant",
    "until @xmath1 = 0.4 , they showed that galaxies shows a clear bimodal distribution in their @xmath8 color and @xmath8 = 2.2 serves as a good classifier of morphology until @xmath27 0.4 by correlating @xmath8 classification with visual classifications .",
    "therefore , we have classified galaxies with @xmath51 2.2 as early - type and galaxies with @xmath52 2.2 as late - type .",
    "figure [ fig : ur.ps ] shows the composite cluster lf for both types of galaxies along with their best - fit schechter functions ( in all five passbands ) .",
    "the best - fit schechter parameters are summarized in table [ tab:5color_ur ] .",
    "as expected , there are noticeable differences in these three morphological classifications , as portrayed by the differences in their composite lfs ( see figures .",
    "[ fig : exp_dev.ps ] , [ fig : cin.ps ] , and [ fig : ur.ps ] )",
    ". however , it is worth stressing here the similarities between the methods .",
    "for example , the faint end slope of the lf is always shallower for early - type galaxies than late - type , regardless of the passband and methodology .",
    "also , the faint end slope for early - type galaxies decreases steadily toward the redder passbands , while the faint - end slope for the late - type galaxies is nearly always above @xmath53 and consistent ( or steeper ) than the field lf in most passbands .",
    "these observations are again qualitatively in agreement with the hypothesis that the bright end of the cluster lf is dominated by bright , old early - types , while the faint - end of the cluster lf represents late - type galaxies maybe in greater numbers than the average field .",
    "this model is in agreement with hierarchical models of structure formation and the model for the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies by the dominant early types .",
    "in this section , we discuss various tests which we have performed on our measurement and results .      to test the robustness of our methods , we performed monte - carlo simulations which involved adding artificial clusters to the sdss data and computing their composite lf using the same algorithms and software as used on the real data . our model for the artificial clusters was constructed using the sdss data on abell 1577 ( at @xmath54 , richness@xmath55 ) .",
    "we used the method described in goto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to make artificial clusters . the radial profile for the artificial clusters was taken to be a king profile ( ichikawa 1986 ) with a concentration index of 1.5 and a cut - off radius of 1.4 mpc , which is the size of abell 1577 ( struble , rood 1987 ) .",
    "the color - magnitude distributions for the artificial clusters were set to be the observed , field - corrected , color - magnitude distributions of abell 1577 binned into 0.2 magnitude bins in both color and magnitude . from this model",
    ", we then constructed artificial clusters as a function of the redshift and overall richness .",
    "for redshift , we created clusters at @xmath1 = 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 , ensuring that we properly accounted for the cosmological effects ; i.e. the clusters became smaller , redder and dimmer with redshift .",
    "we used the k - corrections for an early type spectrum . for richness",
    ", we change the number of galaxies within each cluster randomly between 10 and 50 . for each redshift",
    ", we created 100 clusters ( 400 clusters in total ) .",
    "the galaxies within these artificial cluster were distributed randomly in accordance with the radial and color - magnitude distributions discussed above .",
    "we made no attempt to simulate the density - morphology relation nor the luminosity segregation in clusters .",
    "the artificial clusters were randomly distributed within the real sdss imaging data and we constructed a composite lf for these clusters using exactly the same software as for the real clusters . since the artificial clusters were all made from the same luminosity distribution , the composite lf should therefore look very similar in shape as the original input lf .",
    "figure [ fig : tfake_1577_ab.ps ] shows the result of our monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the histogram shows the original absolute magnitude distribution of abell 1577 after a field correction , while the symbols show the composite luminosity functions which we constructed as a function of the input redshift .",
    "one of the most innovative parts of this analysis is the use of photometric redshifts to determine the composite luminosity function of clusters . as demonstrated in goto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the accuracy of photometric redshift is excellent ( @xmath56 = @xmath50.015 for @xmath570.3 ) and this method will certainly be used in the near future as the number of clusters with photometric redshifts will increase rapidly , far quicker than the number of clusters with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts .    to justify our use of photometric redshifts ,",
    "since all previous composite cluster lf s used spectroscopic redshifts , we constructed a composite lf using only the clusters with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts .",
    "we derived our spectroscopic redshift for ce clusters by matching the sdss spectroscopic galaxy data with our ce clusters .",
    "this was achieved by searching the sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample for any galaxies within the ce cluster radius and within @xmath56 = @xmath50.01 of the photometric redshift of the cluster .",
    "the radius used here was from goto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . if multiple galaxies satisfied this criteria , the closest spectroscopic redshift to the photometric redshift was adopted .",
    "the number of clusters with spectroscopic redshifts was 75 out of 204 at the date of this writing .",
    "the results of this test are shown in figure [ fig : all.eps ] ( in the bottom right - hand panel ) . also the parameters for the best - fit schechter functions",
    "are given in table [ tab:5color ] . and referred to as @xmath41(spec ) .",
    "we only performed this test for the @xmath23 passband . the slope and characteristic magnitude of the best - fit schechter function for the spectroscopically determined lf is in good agreement with that derived using photometric redshifts .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab:5color ] , both @xmath58 and the slope agree within the error .",
    "this test shows that we can truly construct composite lfs using photometric redshift of clusters .",
    "one key aspect of measuring the composite cluster lf is the choice of the cluster centroid . to test the effect of different cluster centroids on the composite lf",
    ", we constructed a composite cluster lf using the position of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) as a centroid instead of the peak in the enhanced density map , as discussed in goto et al .",
    "the bcgs have been determined to be the brightest galaxy among galaxies fainter than @xmath424th magnitude within 0.75 mpc .",
    "galaxies brighter than @xmath424th magnitude are regarded as being foreground galaxies .",
    "the mean offset between the bcg position and the centroid previously used is 1.02 arcmin .",
    "table [ tab : bcg_center ] lists the parameters of the best - fit schechter functions to the five sdss passbands , which should be compared to the values obtained using the optical centroid given in table [ tab:5color ] . in all five bands ,",
    "the characteristic magnitudes and slopes agree very well within the error .",
    "this test shows that our composite lfs are not dependent on a center determination .",
    "since we constructed composite lfs from 2-dimensional , projected sky image , subtraction of fore / background galaxies played an important role in this work .",
    "we test here the effect of making a global background subtraction for all clusters instead of the local background subtraction discussed above .",
    "we use the number - magnitude relation of all the galaxies in the entire 150 deg@xmath13 region as the global background .",
    "table [ tab : global ] gives the best - fit schechter parameters of composite lfs constructed using global background subtraction . compared with table [ tab:5color ] , again",
    ", every schechter parameter agrees very well within 1 @xmath18 .",
    "although we use annuli around clusters to subtract the background to avoid the large - scale structure disturbing the measurement of composite lfs , this test shows that our composite lfs are not dependent on background subtraction .",
    "valotto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that a statistical background subtraction can not re - produce composite lfs using a mock galaxy catalog constructed from a large @xmath59-body simulation .",
    "our result , however , combined with the fact that we derived the same lf as input through a monte - carlos simulation ( in subsection [ sec : monte ] ) , supports that our composite lfs are not subject to background subtraction .",
    "another aspect we were concerned about was our choice of cluster richness criteria . to test this",
    ", we constructed composite lfs of different subsample with @xmath2620 and @xmath2640 , given in table [ tab : richness ] .",

    "their best - fit schechter parameters are @xmath2=@xmath421.1@xmath50.2 and @xmath3=@xmath41.49@xmath50.05 in @xmath64 .",
    "they also studied type - specific lf using exponential and @xmath65 profile fits to classify the galaxy types .",
    "they derived @xmath2=@xmath421.1 and @xmath3=@xmath41.49 for exponential galaxies and @xmath2=@xmath421.2 and @xmath3=@xmath41.08 for @xmath65 galaxies .",
    "considering that they derived composite lfs using the data taken with different instruments analyzed in a different way , it is reassuring that they reached the same conclusion as our results discussed in subsection [ sec : morph ] .",
    "i.e. exponential galaxies have the steeper faint end tail than @xmath65 galaxies , while their @xmath2 are almost the same .",
    "concerning the disagreement of our lfs with previous studies , various differences in measuring composite lfs may be the reason .",
    "the possible sources of differences are different ways of weighting , different ways of background subtraction , and different depths of the luminosity function .",
    "the sample clusters , themselves , should have , to some extent , different richness distributions .",
    "for @xmath2 , although we tried to transform our magnitude into their magnitude , the color conversion between sdss bands and others might not be accurate enough .",
    "thus , the difference with the previous studies is not necessarily a mistake in the analysis , but rather it represents a different way of analysis . throughout our analysis discussed in section [ method ] we carefully used exactly the same way to construct the composite lfs . we thus keep our composite lfs internally consistent .",
    "we studied the composite lf of 204 the sdss ce galaxy clusters .",
    "the over - all composite lf is compared with other composite lfs . comparing it to the field luminosity function",
    ", a tendency of a brighter @xmath2 and a flatter slope is seen .",
    "this is consistent with our understanding that cluster regions are dominated by brighter galaxies than field galaxies .",
    "we divided the composite lf by galaxy morphology in three ways . in all three cases",
    ", we found that early - type galaxies have flatter slopes than late - type galaxies .",
    "these observations are in agreement with the hypothesis that the bright end of the cluster lf is dominated by bright , old early - types , while the faint - end of the cluster lf represents late - type galaxies .",
    "this is also consistent with the morphology  density relation originally advocated by dressler et al .",
    "( 1980 , 1997 ) .",
    "we also studied these composite lfs in five sdss color bands .",
    "the slopes become flatter and flatter toward the redder color bands .",
    "this again suggests that cluster regions are dominated by elliptical galaxies with old stellar population .",
    "these composite lfs provide a good low redshift benchmark to study higher - redshift clusters in the future .",
    "since the data used in this work came from 2% of the sdss data , further studies with large sdss data will increase the statistical significance on these topics as the sdss proceeds .",
