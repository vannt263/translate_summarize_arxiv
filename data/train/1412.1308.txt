    "examples are the large deviations from the dulong - petit limit of the heat capacity of solids , the large isotope kinetic effects that are often observed in reactions that involve a hydrogen transfer as the rate - limiting step  @xcite , and the deviations of the particle momentum distribution of nuclei from the maxwell - boltzmann predictions  @xcite .",
    "one of the most evident signs of the quantum nature of light nuclei is the fractionation of two isotopes @xmath0 and @xmath1 between two environments @xmath2 and @xmath3  where the two environments could correspond to different thermodynamic phases , different compounds or inequivalent positions in the same molecule @xmath4 the isotope fractionation free energy @xmath5 would be zero if the nuclei behaved classicallyd ) , the equilibrium also involves a component of configurational entropy , that means that _ also classically _ @xmath6 . here ,",

    "the isotope fractionation ratio can be determined experimentally with exquisite precision , and is used routinely to gain insight into reactions and phase transformations in geochemistry , biology and atmospheric sciences  @xcite .",
    "for instance , isotope fractionation can be used to trace the origin of water in clouds  @xcite , or to reconstruct paleoclymatic records  @xcite and even to characterize the origin of wine  @xcite . when comparing experimentally - determined fractionation ratios with simulations , one has to distinguish between equilibrium isotope fractionation ",
    "the ratio that is reached after the different phases involved have reached thermodynamic equilibrium , and which is due exclusively to the quantum nature of the isotopes involved  and so - called kinetic isotope effects  that are due to the fact that differences in isotope mass affect reaction rates both classically and quantum mechanically , and that can lead to accumulation of one isotope in a non - equilibrium process  @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on the computational determination of _ equilibrium _ isotope fractionation , so our results can be directly compared with experiments only in systems where thermodynamic equilibrium has been reached . however , accurate theoretical determination of the equilibrium isotope ratio is also useful to set an absolute reference for the equilibrium ratio , which can help determining the kinetic factors that contribute to the observed fractionation .    evaluating fractionation ratios from simulations is far from trivial , because of the need of modelling accurately nuclear quantum effects ( nqes ) . for small gas - phase molecules ,",

    "the exact fractionation ratio in path integral molecular dynamics simulations involves performing a thermodynamic integration of the mean quantum kinetic energy of the tagged atom @xmath13 as a function of the isotope mass  @xcite @xmath14 many improvements have been proposed based on this scheme , including employing a change of variables to reduce the number of thermodynamic integration points , using re - weighting to compute the kinetic energy in a substituted system out of a simulation with only the most abundant isotope  @xcite , and using correlated - noise langevin dynamics  @xcite or high - order path integral factorizations to accelerate the convergence with the number of replicas  @xcite .    here we demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate the isotope fractionation ratios directly , without the need for a thermodynamic integration .",
    "the corresponding estimators are derived from the ratio of the partition functions of the isotope - substituted systems , which is obtained by a `` virtual substitution '' of the isotopes of the tagged atom .",

    "the comparison is interesting because of the use of a different potential energy surface : the calculations for methane in ref .",
    "were based on a a high - quality potential energy surface computed at the ccsd(t ) level of theory  @xcite , whereas the simulations for propane were based on the empirical charmm pes  @xcite .",

    "our calculations give results that are qualitatively at odds with those of ref .  .",
    "results based on the charmm force field show preference for deuterium to localize in the methyl groups and a monothonic dependence on temperature , whereas results based on airebo show preference for methylene , and a non - monothonic dependence that suggests there would probably be an inversion for @xmath136k .",
    "inversion in fractionation ratios as a function of temperature is observed in the liquid / vapor equilibra for water  @xcite , and is consistent with competing quantum effects between the changes of quantum kinetic energy along different molecular axes .",
    "for instance , if the change in the frequencies of the stretching and bending modes between two molecules have different sign , the isotope preference might change as the temperature is increased , since the effect from the lower - frequency mode will become negligible at lower temperature .",
    "these kinds of cancellations are more likely to occur for light atoms , for which there is larger anisotropy between the different components of the kinetic energy .",
    "it is therefore much harder to capture the qualitative fractionation behavior for light atoms than it is for the heavier isotopes , which reinforces the idea of using h / d isotope fractionation as a sensitive benchmark of different potential energy surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the above results show the differential fractionation between a number of gas - phase hydrocarbon molecules under thermodynamic equilibrium , and its strong temperature dependence . for natural gas",
    "there is a general trend for @xmath117 to be depleted in the lighter hydrocarbons  @xcite , which is consistent with our calculations .",
    "however , because of the complicated chemical and biological processes involved during the natural gas production , it is not reasonable to make a direct comparison .",
    "theoretical calculations based on more accurate potential energy surfaces can set an absolute reference point under the equilibrium conditions , so that the kinetic isotope effects can be singled out in the complicated natural gas generation processes .",
    "in this paper we have introduced two direct estimators of the isotope fractionation ratio , that were obtained by computing the ratio of the partition functions of the original and isotope - substituted systems .",
    "these estimators are closely related to those that have been recently introduced based on a free energy perturbation approach  @xcite , and therefore their statistical efficiency is largely determined by the degree of the phase - space overlap between the original and the substituted systems .",
    "hence , the statistical efficiency of these direct estimators is more favorable when the mass ratio between the isotopes approaches one , or when the system temperature increases so that the nuclear quantum effects get smaller .    in both benchmark applications considered here  the zundel cation at 300k , and gas - phase hydrocarbons at room temperature and above ",
    "the scaled - coordinates version gave consistently better performance than the direct thermodynamic estimator , so that the small additional cost associated with the ( relatively infrequent ) evaluation of @xmath62 is more than compensated . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath72 can be evaluated almost for free , and so it is advisable to calculate it regardless , to provide cross - validation of results . when there are many equivalent substitution sites in the system , ( e.g. a bulk liquid ) it is possible to compute the estimator simultaneously for each site and exploit the horizontal statistics . in these cases , particularly for heavy isotopes and temperatures above 300k , @xmath72 can be computed for all sites inexpensively , whereas @xmath62 requires a separate potential energy evaluation for each site , which might tip the balance in favor of the thermodynamic version of our estimators .    in the case of the h / d substitution , we observed that for @xmath62 performing the forward substitution from the lighter to the heavier isotope resulted in larger statistical errors than doing the backwards d@xmath88h substitution .",
    "the analysis in ref .  , which was based on a gaussian ansatz for the free - energy perturbation weighing factor , gives the opposite prediction .",
    "we could explain this discrepancy based on the skewed , asymmetric distribution of the exponent in @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "the implications of this observation are relevant to a much broader class of problems than those considered in the present work : similar exponential terms also enter other methods based on statistical reweighing , such as biased molecular dynamics , jarzynski s inequality , etc .",
    "considering the shape of the distribution of the exponential term can help refine the predictions based on the estimate of its fluctuations , and increase the range of applicability of reweighing techniques .    when considering methods to accelerate the convergence of these estimators we found that unfortunately the combination of path integrals and generalized langevin dynamics  @xcite , that is very effective for the evaluation of nqes on structural properties and kinetic energies , does not help in the efficient evaluations of these estimators , that have a complex non - linear functional form and therefore depend on several bead - bead correlations that are not currently included in pi+gle methods .",
    "however , we found that fourth - order direct estimator ( @xmath86 ) based on the takahashi  imada factorization can be computed quite easily , and they typically lead to improved convergence  even though in the case of hydrocarbons a fortuitous cancellation of errors made second - order estimators as efficient as those including the ti corrections . since the evaluation of the terms needed in the ti scheme is completely inexpensive in case where forces are already computed to integrate the path integral dynamics , one should always compute them and assess on a case - by - case basis if the improved convergence compensates for the statistical errors associated with fourth - order methods .",
    "the applications we have presented also allowed us to draw some observations about the isotope - fractionation behavior in the case of the zundel cation and of gas - phase hydrocarbons . in h@xmath137do@xmath138",
    "one observes a very strong preference for hydrogen to reside in the central , shared position . these findings are consistent with prior experimental and theoretical work , and it would be possible to verify them quantitatively .",
    "such a strong fractionation ratio also suggests that the temperature dependence of @xmath7 could be used to assess the temperature of charged water clusters , similarly to what was recently proposed for neutral ones  @xcite .",
    "fractionation in hydrocarbons shows relatively predictable trends in the case of @xmath139c/@xmath140c , with the heavier carbon isotope residing preferentially in the molecule or position with the largest number of c - c bonds .",
    "comparison with previous results showed that this fractionation ratio is not very sensitive to the choice of inter - atomic potential . on the contrary , results for h / d fractionation showed qualitative discrepancies with previous work .",
    "this discrepancy can be traced to the fact that light elements often show a strongly anisotropic kinetic energy tensor , with different components that can change in opposite directions when changing the atom s environment .",
    "since the value of @xmath7 depends on a subtle cancellation between different components , it will then be more sensitive to the details of the potential , and possibly have a non - trivial temperature dependence .",
    "the direct estimators we have introduced have been implemented in the development version of the path - integral interface i - pi@xcite , making them available for use together with a number of empirical forcefields and electronic structure software packages , including lammps@xcite , cp2k@xcite and fhi - aims@xcite .",
    "fourth - order corrections based on the takahashi - imada scheme can also be easily incorporated , accelerating the convergence with respect to the number of beads .",
    "these direct estimators can be regarded as the final step in the process of making the path integral evaluation of isotope fractionation ratios easily accessible , by eliminating altogether the need of performing a thermodynamic integration .",
    "they will allow a more widespread use of computational modelling to provide reference equilibrium ratios , and assist the interpretation of fractionation data in geochemistry , biology and atmospheric sciences .",
    "in the main text we have discussed the case of fractionation of isotopes between distinct phases , compounds , or molecular sites .",
    "now , let us consider how the direct estimators can be used in a setting in which one can not define a clear - cut distinction between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , but has just one system described by a potential @xmath74 , and the two states are different regions of configuration space , that are associated to two characteristic functions @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which are one if the configuration can be ascribed to one of the states , and zero otherwise . for instance , the functions could select configurations in which the tagged atom is at a given distance from an interface  @xcite , or in a specific hydrogen - bonding environment .",

    "one can compute @xmath149 in a similar way , finally obtaining the desired fractionation ratio .",
    "the convergence of path integral simulations with the number of replicas can be accelerated by using a high - order factorization of the boltzmann operator @xmath150 rather than the simple trotter factorization that leads to eq .  .",
    "many different high - order schemes have been proposed , and here we will focus on the takahashi - imada factorization  @xcite , that leads to a partition function with an error term @xmath151 , consistent with the hamiltonian @xmath152 which contains a correction term that depends on the squared force @xmath153 the fourth - order direct estimators can then be obtained as @xmath154 ^ 2\\right ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath155 .",

    ", one typically uses a free - energy perturbation strategy to obtain averages consistent with eq .  , while performing sampling based on the second - order partition function in eq .",
    "this entails treating @xmath156 as a small pertubation to the trotter hamiltonian in eq .  , and later recovering the fourth - order statistics by re - weighting configurations with the weight @xmath157 so that for instance one can compute @xmath158    note that the performance of reweighed high - order factorizations degrades as the size of the system being studied increases  @xcite .",
    "however , we noticed that the takahashi  imada factorization yields smaller fluctuations of the logarithm of the reweighing factors compared to the suzuki - chin factorization that was used in the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can marginally extend the range of applicability of this approach .",

    "imada estimator ( @xmath86 ) does not lead to a significant improvement of the convergence with the number of beads . to understand why , we computed the effect of the takahashi  imada correction on the centroid viral kinetic energy@xcite @xmath162 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , as well as on their difference @xmath163 ( fig .
