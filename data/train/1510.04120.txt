    "according to quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , matter changes its phase at high temperature and density and bound ( colorless ) hadrons dissolve to interacting ( colored ) quarks and gluons in the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) . along with this deconfinement phase transition at low quark chemical potential @xmath9 a restoration of chiral symmetry ( csr )",
    "is observed in lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations at roughly the same critical temperature or energy density . since at low @xmath9",
    "the phase change is a crossover both transitions do not ( have to ) occur at the same temperature .",
    "the study of the phase boundaries and the properties of the qgp are the main goal of several present and future heavy - ion experiments at sps ( super proton synchrotron ) , rhic ( relativistic heavy - ion collider ) , lhc ( large hadron collider ) and the future fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) as well as nica ( nuclotron - based ion collider facility ) @xcite . since the qgp is created only for a short time ( of a couple of fm / c )",
    "it is quite demanding to study its properties and to find sensible probes for chiral symmetry restoration as well as for the deconfinement transition . only by the measurement of the bulk light hadrons , electromagnetic probes ( dileptons and photons ) , heavy mesons , jets and related correlations we might be able to disentangle the different physics at the phase boundaries especially at high quark chemical potential @xmath9 where a first order transition might take place @xcite .",
    "the question of chiral symmetry restoration at high baryon density and/or high temperature is of fundamental interest in itself and dilepton studies in nucleus - nucleus collisions have been driven by the notion to find signatures for a csr .",
    "as noted above the situation is less clear for finite baryon density where qcd sum rule studies indicate a linear decrease of the scalar quark condensate @xmath10  which is nonvanishing in the vacuum due to a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  with baryon density @xmath11 towards a chiral symmetric phase characterized by @xmath12 0 @xcite .",
    "this decrease of the scalar quark condensate is expected to lead to a change of the hadron properties with density and temperature , i.e. in a chirally restored phase the vector and axial vector currents should become equal @xcite ; the latter implies that e.g. the @xmath13 and @xmath14 spectral functions should become identical . since the scalar quark condensate @xmath15 is not a direct observable , its manifestations should be found indirectly in different hadronic abundancies and spectra or particle ratios like @xmath0 , @xmath1 etc .",
    "nowadays , our knowledge about the hadron properties at high temperature or baryon density is based on heavy - ion experiments from schwerionen - synchrotron ( sis ) to sps energies where hot and dense nuclear systems are produced on a timescale of a few fm / c together with partonic subsystems .",
    "the information from ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic or lhc essentially addresses the dominant partonic phases at low quark chemical potential @xmath9 , a region which can be well addressed by lqcd , too .",
    "this knowledge , however , does not allow for proper extrapolations to the properties of qcd at high baryon density which has been the major motivation for the future construction of the fair / nica facilities and is in the focus of the beam - energy - scan ( bes ) program at rhic .",
    "however , any informations on the properties of hadrons in the nuclear environment are obtained from the comparison of experimental data with nonequilibrium kinetic transport theory @xcite . as a genuine feature of transport theories in the hadronic sector",
    "there are two essential ingredients : i.e. the _ baryon ( and meson ) scalar _ and _ vector self - energies _ as well as _ in - medium elastic _ and _ inelastic cross sections _ ( or transition matrix elements ) for all hadrons involved .",
    "whereas in the low - energy regime these transport coefficients can be calculated in the dirac - brueckner approach starting from the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite this is no longer possible at high baryon density @xmath16-@xmath17 and high temperature , since the number of independent hadronic degrees - of - freedom increases drastically and the interacting hadronic system should approach a phase with @xmath18 0 @xcite as mentioned before .    in this work",
    "we will concentrate on excitation functions of hadronic observables from sis to sps energies with the aim to find out optimal experimental conditions to search for traditional phenomena such as strangeness enhancement in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite or the horn in the @xmath0 ratio @xcite .",
    "both phenomena have been addressed to a deconfinement transition .",
    "indeed , the actual experimental observation could not be described within conventional hadronic transport theory @xcite and remained a major challenge for microscopic approaches . only within hybrid approaches",
    "@xcite or three - fluid hydrodynamics @xcite a description of the horn phenomenon could be achieved due to the assumption of chemical equilibrium in the hydro phase .",
    "this also holds true for the statistical model fits assuming full chemical equilibration @xcite . however , hadronic interaction rates showed up to be too slow to reach chemical equilibrium in these nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "this was also found for the partonic stage in ref .",
    "accordingly , the quest for a microscopic explanation of the @xmath0 horn remained .    in 2006 mclerran and pisarski suggested that a new form of matter might exist at high baryon chemical potential @xcite where the degrees - of - freedom are still confined but chiral symmetry is restored such that parity doublets appear in the excitation spectrum . this lead to an extended scenario for the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter @xcite .",
    "although a clear separated phase of such quarkyonic matter might be overtaken one could expect a partially chiral restored phase before deconfinement sets in as suggested also by nambu - jona - lasinio models @xcite .",
    "our studies are performed within the phsd transport approach that has been described in refs .",
    "phsd incorporates explicit partonic degrees - of - freedom in terms of strongly interacting quasiparticles ( quarks and gluons ) in line with an equation - of - state from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) as well as dynamical hadronization and hadronic elastic and inelastic collisions in the final reaction phase .",
    "this approach has been tested for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions from the sps to lhc energy regime @xcite .",
    "we recall that longitudinal and transverse momentum spectra of nucleons , pions , kaons and antibaryons have been successfully reproduced within phsd within the full energy range from the upper sps to lhc energies as well dilepton and photon observables .",
    "moreover , the collective flow coefficients @xmath22 for the azimuthal angular distributions were found to be well in line with the phsd calculations as well as the suppression of hard probes such as charm quarks at rhic energies @xcite . however , in all these studies the question of chiral symmetry restoration has been discarded since the observables analyzed were driven by the dominant deconfinement transition and the parton dynamics in the qgp . only when going down in bombarding energy to the alternating - gradient - synchrotron ( ags ) regime severe discrepancies were found @xcite in the directed proton , pion and kaon flows as well as in the strangeness production .",
    "the actual results at ags energies are close to those from the hadron - string dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach ( without a partonic phase ) in refs .",
    "this does not come as a surprise since at low energy densities ( @xmath23 gev/@xmath24 ) the phsd merges with hsd . by observing that the discrepancies show up already within hsd - and are very similar in phsd -",
    "we conclude that the deconfinement phase transition does not show responsibility for these discrepancies .",
    "we here suggest that the missing strangeness is due to the neglect of chiral symmetry restoration ( in the schwinger mechanism of string decay ) at high baryon density .",
    "accordingly , a partial restoration of chiral symmetry may be achieved in the hadronic but confined phase .",
    "such a situation might be attributed to quarkyonic matter out - off equilibrium . to investigate this proposal",
    "we extend the existing phsd transport approach @xcite to include essential facets of chiral symmetry restoration in terms of the schwinger mechanism for string decay .",
    "since phsd has been successfully applied to describe the final distribution of mesons ( with light quark content ) from sps up to lhc energies @xcite , it provides a solid framework for the description of the creation , expansion and hadronization of the qgp as well as the hadronic expansion with partly resonant scatterings ( like @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) .",
    "this study is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ phsd ] we recall the basic ideas of the phsd approach and describe the evaluation of the scalar quark condensate as well as the modified string decay in line with csr . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the actual computation of particle spectra and particle ratios in central au+au collisions from 4 to 158 a gev in different limits , i.e. with and without csr , with and without partonic degrees - of - freedom .",
    "a summary completes this work in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach  @xcite is a microscopic covariant dynamical model for strongly interacting systems formulated on the basis of kadanoff - baym equations @xcite for green s functions in phase - space representation ( in first order gradient expansion beyond the quasiparticle approximation ) .",
    "the approach consistently describes the full evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision from the initial hard scatterings and string formation through the dynamical deconfinement phase transition to the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) as well as hadronization and the subsequent interactions in the expanding hadronic phase as in the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach @xcite .",
    "the transport theoretical description of quarks and gluons in the phsd is based on the dynamical quasi - particle model ( dqpm ) for partons that is constructed to reproduce lqcd results for a quark - gluon plasma in thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite on the basis of effective propagators for quarks and gluons .",
    "the dqpm is thermodynamically consistent and the effective parton propagators incorporate finite masses ( scalar mean - fields ) for gluons / quarks as well as a finite width that describes the medium dependent reaction rate . for fixed thermodynamic temperaure @xmath27 the partonic width",
    "s @xmath28 fix the effective two - body interactions that are presently implemented in the phsd  @xcite .",
    "the phsd differs from conventional boltzmann approaches in a couple of essential aspects :    * it incorporates dynamical quasi - particles due to the finite width of the spectral functions ( imaginary part of the propagators ) in line with complex retarded selfenergies ; * it involves scalar mean - fields that substantially drive the collective flow in the partonic phase ; * it is based on a realistic equation of state from lattice qcd and thus reproduces the speed of sound @xmath29 reliably ; * the hadronization is described by the fusion of off - shell partons to off - shell hadronic states ( resonances or strings ) ; * all conservation laws ( energy - momentum , flavor currents etc . )",
    "are fulfilled in the hadronization contrary to coalescence models ; * the effective partonic cross sections no longer are given by pqcd and are defined by the dqpm in a consistent fashion .",
    "these cross sections are probed by transport coefficients ( correlators ) in thermodynamic equilibrium by performing phsd calculations in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions ( shear- and bulk viscosity , electric conductivity , magnetic susceptibility etc .",
    "@xcite ) .    an actual nucleus - nucleus collision within phsd proceeds as follows : in the beginning of a relativistic heavy - ion collisions color - neutral strings ( described by the fritiof lund model  @xcite ) ( including pythia 6.4 @xcite ) are produced in hard scatterings of nucleons from the impinging nuclei .",
    "these strings are dissolved into pre - hadrons with a formation time of @xmath8 0.8 fm / c in their rest frame , except for the leading hadrons , i.e. the fastest residues of the string ends , which can re - interact ( practically instantly ) with hadrons with a reduced cross sections in line with quark counting rules . if , however , the local energy density is larger than the critical value for the phase transition , which is taken to be @xmath8 0.5 @xmath30 in line with lqcd @xcite , the pre - hadrons melt into ( colored ) effective quarks and antiquarks in their self - generated repulsive mean - field as defined by the dqpm  @xcite . in the dqpm",
    "the quarks , antiquarks and gluons are dressed quasiparticles and have temperature - dependent effective masses and widths which have been fitted to lattice thermal quantities such as energy density , pressure and entropy density .",
    "the nonzero width of the quasiparticles implies the off - shellness of partons , which is taken into account in the scattering and propagation of partons in the qgp on the same footing ( i.e. propagators and couplings ) .",
    "the transition from the partonic to hadronic degrees - of - freedom ( for light quarks / antiquarks ) is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark - antiquark pairs to mesonic resonances or three quarks ( antiquarks ) to baryonic states , i.e. by the dynamical hadronization .",
    "we already mention here that this hadronization process is restricted to bulk transverse momenta @xmath31 up to @xmath32 2 gev and has to be replaced by fragmentation for high @xmath31 @xcite in future .",
    "note that due to the off - shell nature of both partons and hadrons , the hadronization process described above obeys all conservation laws ( i.e. four - momentum conservation and flavor current conservation ) in each event , the detailed balance relations and the increase in the total entropy @xmath33 .    in the hadronic phase phsd",
    "is equivalent to the hadron - strings dynamics ( hsd ) model @xcite that has been employed in the past from sis to sps energies . on the other hand the phsd approach has been tested for p+p , p+a and relativistic heavy - ion collisions from lower sps to lhc energies and been successful in describing a large number of experimental data including single - particle spectra , collective flow  @xcite as well as electromagnetic probes @xcite or charm observables @xcite .      in the phsd / hsd the string excitation and decay plays a decisive role for elastic and inelastic collisions which has been well tested for hadronic reactions in vacuum in a wide energy range .",
    "we recall that in the hadronic phase the high energy inelastic hadron - hadron collisions are described by the fritiof model @xcite , where two incoming nucleons emerge the reaction as two excited color singlet states , i.e. strings. according to the fritiof model a string is characterized by the leading constituent quarks of the incoming hadron and a tube of color flux is supposed to be formed connecting the rapidly receding string - ends . in the phsd approach baryonic ( @xmath34 ) and",
    "mesonic ( @xmath35 ) strings are considered with different flavors ( @xmath36 ) . in the uniform color field of the strings virtual @xmath37 or @xmath38 pairs",
    "are produced causing the tube to fission and thus to create mesons or baryon - antibaryon pairs ( with a formation time @xmath8 0.8 fm / c ) .",
    "the production probability @xmath39 of massive @xmath40 or @xmath38 pairs is suppressed in comparison to light flavor production ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) according to a schwinger - like formula @xcite , i.e. @xmath43 with @xmath44  gev@xmath45 denoting the string tension and @xmath46 the appropriate strange and light quark masses .",
    "thus in the lund string picture the production of strangeness and baryon - antibaryon pairs is controlled by the constituent quark ( and diquark ) masses .",
    "inserting the constituent ( dressed ) quark masses @xmath47  gev and @xmath48 gev in the vacuum a value of @xmath49 is obtained from eq .",
    "while the strangeness production in proton - proton collisions at sps energies is reasonably well reproduced with this value , the strangeness yield for p  +  be collisions at ags energies is underestimated by roughly 30% ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for that reason the relative factors used in the phsd / hsd model are @xcite @xmath50 with a linear transition of the strangeness suppression factor @xmath51 as a function of @xmath52 in between .",
    "these settings have been fixed in ref .",
    "@xcite for hsd in 1998 and kept since then also for phsd .",
    "additionally a fragmentation function @xmath53 has to be specified , which is the probability distribution for hadrons with transverse mass @xmath54 to acquire the energy - momentum fraction @xmath55 from the fragmenting string , @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58  gev@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "these settings for the string decay to hadrons have been found to match well experimental observations for particle production in p+p and p+a reactions @xcite . in these reactions",
    "the vacuum constituent ( dressed ) quark masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 are relevant that , however , should be different in the nuclear medium as noted above .",
    "we mention that in hsd / phsd we include antinucleon annihilation into several mesons while taking into account also the inverse processes of @xmath60 creation in multi - meson interactions by detailed balance  @xcite .",
    "the modifications in phsd3.3 with respect to the hsd version 2.3 from 2003 employed in the previous studies in refs .",
    "@xcite are as follows :    * the energy - density cut for hadronic interactions ( @xmath61 1 gev/@xmath24 ) has been reduced to @xmath61 0.5 gev/@xmath24 because the unquenched lattice qcd results from the bmw collaboration in 2009 @xcite were converging to the lower critical energy density @xmath62 0.5 gev/@xmath24 for the deconfinement phase transition . accordingly , inelastic hadronic collisions in local cells with energy density 0.5 gev/@xmath63 1 gev/@xmath24 no longer happen in the actual version which leads to a reduction of the meson multiplicity ( dominantly pions and kaons ) by about 10 to 15% .",
    "since kaons and pions are effected by about the same reduction factor their ratios practically do not change .",
    "* the inverse processes of @xmath60 creation in multi - meson interactions by detailed balance  @xcite are now included by default .",
    "* a couple of strangeness exchange reactions have been added in meson - baryon and baryon - baryon collisions following refs . @xcite . *",
    "the hadronic reaction channels are symmetric now with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "this has a minor impact at the laboratory energies considered in this study .    after reviewing the basic concepts of the phsd approach we now come to the modeling of chiral symmetry restoration in the phsd .",
    "as is well known the scalar quark condensate @xmath15 is viewed as an order parameter for the restoration of chiral symmetry at high baryon density and temperature , however , it is not a quantity that can directly be determined by experiment .",
    "nevertheless , some close links to low energy constants and nuclear quantities can be employed to determine the scalar quark condensate .",
