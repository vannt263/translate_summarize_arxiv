    "many social , biological , and physical systems can be modeled as networks , i.e. , connected graphs with at most a single edge between nodes : nodes represent entities and edges represent interaction pathways among the nodes  @xcite .",
    "the connectivity pattern in these networks encode information about the structure of the system  @xcite .",
    "an important and much studied feature of these networks is their degree distribution @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the fraction of nodes of the network that have @xmath4 connections to other nodes .",
    "it was found that many interesting networks such as the internet @xcite and the patterns of human sexual contacts @xcite are very heterogeneous with approximately `` scale - free''(sf ) degree distribution : i.e. , @xmath8 ( power law distribution ) with @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the study of epidemics in heterogeneous networks is therefore of practical importance for the control of the spread of cyber viruses and biological epidemics .",
    "the mathematical studies of epidemics on the other hand often make the assumption of a homogeneous population  @xcite .",
    "this means that any infective individual is an equally likely source for the further transmission of the disease to other members of the population with whom that individual is in contact and vice versa . the simplest epidemiological model of that kind is the sis model  @xcite . in the sis model",
    ", individuals can only exist in two discrete states ; healthy ( but susceptible ) or infected .",
    "the disease processes are specified as follows : infected individuals become susceptible ( healthy ) at rate @xmath10 , independently of their environment .",
    "we shall choose time units in which @xmath11 .",
    "susceptible individuals become infected at a rate @xmath3 multiplied by the number of infected neighbors , i.e. , infected nodes to which they are connected by an edge . when the web of interactions between individuals is taken to be",
    "a regular lattice the stochastic process describing this system is the harris contact process  @xcite .",
    "epidemic behavior in these homogeneous networks , where each node has @xmath12 neighbors , @xmath13 , show a `` phase transition '' as the rate @xmath3 at which an infected individual infects a susceptible neighbor , is changed ; i.e. , there exists a critical value @xmath14 below which the only stationary state is a disease - free state ( or absorbing phase ) and above which there is an endemic infected state ( or active phase ) .",
    "this can be proven rigorously for the stochastic contact process on a regular lattice , an infinite homogeneous network and is inherited by mean field models based on this process .",
    "the mean field critical value , @xmath15 , is proportional to @xmath16 , the inverse of the number of `` interacting neighbors ''  @xcite .",
    "this mean field @xmath15 is smaller than that for the contact process .",
    "the latter depends not only on the number of neighbors but also on the topology of the lattice ( see later )  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question then is how to extend these models , which correspond to networks with homogeneous connectivity , to real world situations where the number of contacts varies greatly from one node to another  @xcite . in such heterogeneous networks ,",
    "each node has a statistically significant probability of having a very large number of connections compared to the average connectivity of the network .",
    "the mean field version of this problem was studied in  @xcite where it was shown that the epidemic threshold decreases with increasing second moment of the connectivity distribution . as a result epidemic processes in infinite sf networks with diverging second moment , @xmath17 , are believed not to possess any epidemic threshold below which the infection can not produce an epidemic outbreak or an endemic infected state @xcite .",
    "the absence of an epidemic threshold in sf networks makes them very vulnerable .",
    "this remains true even if one takes into account the finite size of real systems which of course always have finite second moments .",
    "in general the epidemic threshold for a heterogeneous network is much smaller than for a homogeneous network with the same average number of contacts  @xcite .",
    "the presence of `` assortative '' or `` dissortative '' two - point degree correlation in sf networks with @xmath9 does not appear to alter the absence of epidemic threshold  @xcite .    in these analyses",
    "all edges are treated in the same way .",
    "there are however many situations where there are differences between the `` strength '' of different edges .",
    "we investigate here cases where the assigned weight of an edge between two nodes depends on the connectivity of these nodes .",
    "we consider in particular saturation effects due , for example , to the fact that disease transmission requires a certain amount of contact time or `` finite time commitment '' from both individuals in contact .",
    "this has the effect of lowering the effective connectivity for highly connected nodes and thereby decreasing the importance of the `` heavy tails '' in @xmath0 .",
    "such saturation effects then lead to a finite threshold even when the second moment of @xmath0 diverges .",
    "an example in which saturation effects , due to temporal limitation of interactions , play an important role is holling s `` the principle of time budget '' in behavioral ecology  @xcite .    using mean field approximations appropriate for heterogeneous network models  @xcite of epidemics we calculate the critical value @xmath7 for different saturation patterns .",
    "we also find in this mean field approximation , which neglects degree - degree correlations between different nodes , the behavior of the endemic prevalence @xmath18 , i.e. , the fraction of infected nodes of degree @xmath4 , for @xmath3 close to @xmath7 .",
    "they all have the same behavior for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 increasing with @xmath4 ; @xmath22 when the third moment is finite .",
    "this dependence on @xmath4 is missed by the homogeneous approximation of the contact network .",
    "we then investigate , via numerical simulations , the behavior of the stochastic contact process on a regular lattice consisting of nodes with two different degrees .",
    "the results are compared with mean field approximations with and without neglect of degree - degree correlations .",
    "the mean field theory for the contact process , obtained by neglecting correlations between different nodes , is described by an equation for the density of infected nodes @xmath23 , present at time @xmath24 , which can be written as  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath12 is the coordination number .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ mfeq ] ) yields @xmath26 $ ] . the steady state solution of eq.(1 ) , obtained as @xmath27 , has an epidemic threshold @xmath28 . for @xmath29 , any initial infection spreads and becomes persistent with stationary total prevalence level @xmath30 .",
    "below the threshold(@xmath31 ) , the initial infection dies out exponentially fast .",
    "a similar transition occurs for the stochastic contact process on a regular lattice with edges between nearest neighbors .",
    "the critical values @xmath7 for the lattice @xmath32 are @xmath33 in one - dimension(@xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 in two - dimension(@xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , etc .",
    "@xmath39 approaches @xmath40 as @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "consider now a general network with degree distribution @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the fraction of the nodes with degree @xmath4 which are infected at time @xmath24 .",
    "we define @xmath43 as the effective transmission , or infectivity , rate across an edge going from a node with degree @xmath4 to a node with degree @xmath44 : @xmath45 in the absence of saturation effects .",
    "the mean field equation of the contact process on this network  @xcite which ignores correlations between the states of the nodes , yields the following set of differential equations for @xmath42 @xmath46 we can interpret @xmath47 as the effective transmission rate of infection to an uninfected node of degree @xmath4 by all infected nodes with which it is in contact via any of its @xmath4 edges , @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the probability that an edge emerging from a node of degree @xmath4 has its other end at a node with degree @xmath44 and @xmath50 is the effective strength of such a bond .",
    "we shall now assume further that @xmath51 with @xmath52 , i.e. random attachment ( no degree - degree correlation ) .",
    "to specify @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ qeq ] ) , we make the simplifying assumption that an individual with @xmath4 contacts spends equal time with each neighbor . the effective strength of an edge is then given by a product of ratios of effective connectivity to total connectivity of each node in contact , @xmath53 with @xmath45 corresponding to uniform bond strength .",
    "( [ sfeq ] ) can now be written in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 multiplying eq .",

    "the stationary total prevalence @xmath106 with saturation is smaller than that without saturation for all @xmath107 .",
