    "the energy stored in active region magnetic fields produces large - scale solar activity , in particular solar flares",
    ". flares often occur at sites in active regions overlying neutral lines where fields are strongly sheared , suggesting a connection between flares and large scale electric currents in the solar corona .",
    "the most accurate determinations of active region magnetic fields and associated currents are based on measurements of the polarisation state of magnetically sensitive photospheric lines  @xcite .",
    "the data are used to produce vector magnetograms , which are maps of the vector magnetic field @xmath2 across regions on the photosphere ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to the heliographic west and north directions respectively , and @xmath5 is the radially outwards direction ) .",
    "the process of going from polarisation measurements to vector magnetogram values involves atmospheric modelling , the resolution of an intrinsic 180-degree ambiguity in the direction of the component of the field transverse to the line of sight , rotation of coordinate systems , and often also involves rebinning of the data .",
    "the resulting field values are substantially uncertain",
    ". contributions to the uncertainty include errors in the original polarisation measurements , inaccuracy of the atmospheric model assumed in spectro - polarimetric inversion , errors in the ambiguity resolution , and loss of information in rebinning .",
    "the measurement errors depend on the instrument , and two types of instruments are in use .",
    "spectro - polarimeters record the full stokes profile at many wavelengths across a magnetically sensitive spectral line , whilst magnetographs , or filter - based instruments , record polarisation signals integrated with respect to wavelength over a line @xcite .",
    "the hinode solar optical telescope ( sot ) focal plane package includes a spectro - polarimeter  @xcite , and the helioseismic and magnetic imager on the solar dynamic observatory ( sdo ) provides filtergrams  @xcite .",
    "spectro - polarimeter typically have a high spectral resolution and provide very accurate measurements of the polarisation state , but they take longer to produce the data for a vector magnetogram and the magnetic field may change during the observation interval .",
    "filter instruments produce data for a region on the sun more rapidly , but they lack the spectral resolution and intrinsic high accuracy provided by a spectro - polarimeter .    given a set of vector magnetic field values , estimates of the vertical ( locally radial ) electric current density at the level of the photosphere ( @xmath6 )",
    "may be made using ampre s law : @xmath7 where we introduce the notation @xmath8 if the uncertainties in the field values are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and centered differencing is used to estimate the derivatives , then the uncertainties in the derivatives are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the grid spacing in the magnetogram in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "if the spatial scale for variation of the horizontal field is @xmath14 , then we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote characteristic values of the field components . in that case",
    "@xmath19 equations  ( [ eq : unc_deriv_ests ] ) imply that if there are significant fractional uncertainties in the field values , then the derivative estimates may be substantially uncertain , in particular for high - resolution data ( with @xmath20 ) .",
    "the current densities obtained using equation  ( [ eq : jz0_ampere ] ) will be correspondingly uncertain .",
    "errors in the determination of current densities from vector magnetogram data were discussed by @xcite and @xcite , who assigned constant uncertainties for field components in the directions along , and transverse to , the line of sight .",
    "uncertainty values may be assigned to individual vector magnetogram field values based on the quality of the model fit in the spectro - polarimetric inversion , and this information is now routinely supplied with vector magnetogram field values ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "other sources of uncertainty have also been discussed , including errors in ambiguity resolution  @xcite , and errors introduced by the rebinning of data in the construction of magnetograms  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear force - free model is often used to model the coronal magnetic field based on vector magnetogram data ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the model is defined by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the force - free parameter .",
    "the @xcite method of solution of these equations takes as boundary conditions the values of @xmath24 at the photosphere , and the values of @xmath0 ( or the values of @xmath23 ) over one polarity of @xmath24 .",
    "other methods , in particular the optimization method ( e.g.  @xcite , ) , use all three components of @xmath25 at the photosphere as boundary conditions . in practice",
    "all methods modify the boundary data substantially from the values in the vector magnetogram in order to achieve a solution to the force - free model  ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for the active region",
    "modelled by @xcite using the ` self - consistent ' grad - rubin procedure @xcite , the current densities in the magnetogram were altered to the extent that the average absolute change in the horizontal field was 170  gauss , and the average ratio of the change in the horizontal field to the assigned uncertainty in the horizontal field , on a pointwise basis across the magnetogram , was @xmath26 .",
    "the changes greatly exceeded the nominal uncertainties , which is typical .",
    "the ` preprocessing ' procedure often used with the optimization method of nonlinear force - free solution  @xcite alters the transverse components of the field by @xmath27  gauss in strong field regions  . if nonlinear force - free codes are applied to vector magnetogram boundary data without these changes , accurate solutions to the nonlinear force - free model are ( generally ) not obtained .",
    "the large changes required in vector magnetogram data to achieve nonlinear force - free model solutions are most likely due to the inconsistency of boundary data with the model  ( see e.g.   @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the solar magnetic field is not expected to be force - free at the level of the photosphere .",
    "errors in the field estimates also lead to inconsistency . depending on the solution method ,",
    "this problem may cause the solution magnetic fields to have significant departures from the divergence - free condition  .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the problem of estimating electric current densities from vector magnetogram boundary data , taking into account uncertainties in the data .",
    "a method is introduced for calculating a set of boundary values of @xmath0 which minimize departures from centred difference estimates for the current densities at locations where the values are accurate ( according to the uncertainties ) , and which minimize the sum of @xmath1 across the magnetogram .",
    "the goal is an estimate of the current density which avoids large values produced by errors .",
    "the method is tested in application to a test case with known errors .",
    "the paper is divided as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the method , and section  3 describes the test and analyzes the results .",
    "section  4 draws conclusions .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : jz0_ampere ] ) provides the vertical current density in terms of the horizontal field gradients @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the problem consists in estimating the gradients from the data , subject to unertainties , and we also seek to avoid large ( spurious ) values of the resulting vertical current densities , produced by points with large uncertainties . hence we consider the problem of minimizing @xmath30 where the indices refer to points @xmath31 in the magnetogram , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are estimates of the gradients , and where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "it is useful to non - dimensionalize by expressing lengths , field strengths , and current densities in units of characteristic values @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively . using equation  ( [ eq : jz0_ampere ] ) , equation  ( [ eq : f ] )",

    "we refer to equation  ( [ eq : jzmin ] ) as the ` minimum current ' estimate for the current density .    in the following we use centered differences to provide the estimates of the gradients : @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "where @xmath13 is the grid spacing in the magnetogram in @xmath3 and @xmath4 . with these choices",
    "the uncertainties in the gradients , using propagation of errors , are @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the error in the current density is @xmath57 higher order differencing schemes are sometimes used . in the general case equation  ( [ eq : uijd ] ) is replaced by @xmath58 where the sum enumerates the points involved in the differencing , and the @xmath59 are coefficients .",

    "this value of @xmath97 was chosen because it reduces the noise in weak field regions to small values .",
    "the values of @xmath98 shown in panel ( e ) provide the estimate @xmath94 , and the uncertainties in the current density values @xmath99 follow from equations  ( [ eq : su])-([eq : sv ] ) assuming @xmath89 at points with noise , and @xmath100 at points without noise .",
    "panel ( f ) shows that @xmath95 returns a good approximation to the underlying distribution of current density in the boundary , except at locations affected by the noise in the horizontal field .    with the chosen value of @xmath97 ,",
    "the rms value of @xmath101 over the boundary points with @xmath102 is close to unity .",
    "this is because the current density at the locations affected by noise is reduced by a value essentially equal to the noise . for this test case",
    "the minimum current estimate changes the boundary values within the uncertainties .    *",
    "*      the minimum current estimates for the current density enable reconstruction of a nonlinear force - free field .",
    "if the cfit code is applied using the noisy current density estimates @xmath94 the grad - rubin iteration does not converge : the noise in the data prevents a successful reconstruction .",
    "however , accurate force - free solutions are obtained using the minimum current estimate for the current densities .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the force - free solutions .",

    "the white field lines correspond to the p solution , and the black field lines to the n solution .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the p and n solutions are twisted bipole configurations which are similar to the original field [ panel ( a ) ] and to each other , but are not identical .",
    "the p and the n solutions have less twist than the original field due to the reductions in current density at points affected by noise , and the energies of the fields are correspondingly decreased .",
    "the energy @xmath103 of the original field shown in panel ( a ) is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the energy of a potential field with the same lower boundary values for @xmath24 [ calculated by the method described for the cfit code  @xcite ] .",
    "the energies of the p and n solutions shown in panel ( b ) are given by @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the reconstructed p and n fields contain about 80% and about 60% of the free magnetic energy of the original field , respectively .",
    "we apply also the self - consistency procedure presented in @xcite , which uses boundary values at both polarities to identify a single nlfff solution .",
    "the procedure involves a cycle of calculations of p and n solutions . after a pair of solutions",
    "is calculated , the boundary values of @xmath23 in the two solutions are averaged , taking into account uncertainties in the @xmath23 values .",
    "the resulting averaged @xmath23 values provide the boundary conditions for the p and n solutions in the next cycle . after a number of cycles , the p and",
    "n solutions agree , and provide a ` self consistent ' solution .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figure 2 illustrate the results .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the p and n solutions  the white and black curves , respectively  after nine self - consistency cycles .",
    "the two sets of field lines are mostly overlapping .",
    "the energies of the p and n solutions are @xmath108 .",
    "a self - consistent solution is found , with a free energy a few percent higher than the energy of the original field .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the @xmath0 values in the self - consistent field , for comparison with panel ( c ) of figure  1 .",
    "the self - consistency procedure recovers a good approximation to the original set of current density values , although there are detailed differences .",
    "the method is able , to some extent , to ` remove the noise ' because at a boundary point affected by noise , say at the p polarity , the uncertainty in the @xmath23 value is large .",
    "the averaging procedure replaces this @xmath23 value with the @xmath23 value from the n solution , provided it has a much smaller uncertainty .",
    "this procedure generally recovers the original @xmath23 values .",
    "the self - consistent solution is qualitatively similar to the original field .",
    "a quantitative measure is provided by the mean vector error @xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the original nlfff , @xmath111 is the field obtained by the self - consistency procedure , and @xmath112 is the number of grid points .",
    "we find @xmath113 , indicating close correspondence .",
    "a method is presented ( the ` minimum current ' method ) for estimating vertical electric current densities * @xmath0 * at the photosphere from vector magnetogram data .",
    "the procedure alters the horizontal field gradients used to calculate the current densities subject to the uncertainties in the estimates for the field gradients , and also minimizes the sum of the square of the vertical current densities over all points in the magnetogram . the resulting minimum current estimate for the vertical current density at a given boundary location",
    "is reduced from the original estimate by a factor @xmath114 , where @xmath99 is the uncertainty in the original estimate of the current density , and @xmath97 is a chosen constant which determines the relative importance of adherence to the original current density estimate or minimization of the sum of @xmath1 over all boundary locations .",
    "the minimum current method provides an estimate for the current density which preserves values of the current density at locations with small uncertainties , and reduces the current density at locations with large uncertainties .",
    "the nonlinear force - free ( nlfff ) model is often applied to vector magnetogram data to provide a proxy coronal field  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the construction of an accurate solution to the model requires modification of the boundary data from observed magnetogram values  ( e.g.   @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum current method may provide a more systematic approach to this modification .",
    "a demonstration of the method is presented , in application to boundary field values for a nlfff twisted bipole field configuration , with noise of a known amplitude added at a fraction of boundary locations .",
    "the model field values are taken to represent observed data with known uncertainties .",
    "the minimum current method recovers a good approximation to the original current density values in the boundary from the noisy data , except at locations affected by the noise .",
    "the method alters the boundary values for current density within the uncertainties .",
    "the minimum current method boundary values are shown also to enable nlfff reconstructions .",
    "the p and n solutions obtained from the boundary values are twisted bipole field configurations similar to the original nlfff , but with reduced energies , due to the reduction in the boundary current density at locations affected by the noise .",
    "the self - consistency procedure @xcite is applied , and demonstrated to produce a field which is a close match to the original nlfff .",
    "the energy of the self consistent solution is within a few percent of the energy of the original nlfff .",
    "the self - consistency procedure uses information on current density over both polarities of the boundary field , and hence is able to recover current density values affected by noise at one or other polarity .",
    "we have chosen to minimize @xmath1 across the vector magnetogram to produce boundary data suitable for nlfff modeling .",
    "the vertical current density is a boundary condition for the force - free model , and large estimates of @xmath0 from vector magnetogram data ( which may be due to observational errors ) can prevent nlfff codes from producing an accurate force - free solution .",
    "however , this choice may remove or reduce local current concentrations which are real , and which contribute significantly to the energy of the field .",
    "methods of resolving the 180-degree ambiguity used to produce vector magnetograms may also exclude real currents in the data ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "an advantage of the present method is that , if the uncertainties associated with currents are small , the currents are preserved .",
    "the accuracy of the minimum current estimate depends on the accuracy of the uncertainties provided",
    ".    the test of the method presented here is highly idealised .",
    "it is not intended to provide a realistic example of the application of the method to vector magnetogram data , but only to demonstrate the method , and to show its performance in the best case .",
    "the method of inclusion of noise in the boundary data ( adding gaussian noise of known amplitude at specific locations to the horizontal field components of a nlfff calculated from analytic boundary conditions ) does not produce a close approximation to real solar data . we have not ( yet ) confronted the challenge of estimating electric currents from solar data with the minimum current method .",
    "other studies have examined the influence of noise in vector magnetogram data .",
    "these studies add noise to synthetic line profiles , and then apply the various steps involved in constructing vector magnetograms ( inversion , ambiguity resolution , co - ordinate transformations and rebinning , etc . ) .",
    "this process accurately mimics the influence of measurement errors on vector magnetograms .",
    "tests of the method on data of this kind may be tried in future .",
    "the current density estimates presented here use centered differences , but higher order differencing schemes could in principle be used , following equations  ( [ eq : uijd])([eq : sjz - general ] ) .",
    "high order schemes offer advantage in estimating gradients when applied to well - sampled data with small uncertainties , but the advantage is lost in application to sparse data , or data with substantial errors , and these schemes have the disadvantage of introducing correlations in the neighbouring estimates . as such we have chosen to use centered differences .",

    "<S> electric currents in solar active regions are thought to provide the energy released via magnetic reconnection in solar flares . </S>",
    "<S> vertical electric current densities @xmath0 at the photosphere may be estimated from vector magnetogram data , subject to substantial uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the values provide boundary conditions for nonlinear force - free modelling of active region magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> a method is presented for estimating values of @xmath0 taking into account uncertainties in vector magnetogram field values , and minimizing @xmath1 across the active region . </S>",
    "<S> the method is demonstrated using the boundary values of the field for a force - free twisted bipole , with the addition of noise at randomly chosen locations . </S>"
