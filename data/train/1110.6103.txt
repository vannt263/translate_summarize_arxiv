    "the kondo model consists of a localized spin-1/2 which is coupled to the electrons in the host metal via a spin exchange interaction . the original motivation to study  @xcite the properties of this and related models was the observation of a resistance minimum in some metals in the 1930s .",
    "more than two decades ago it was realized  @xcite that the kondo model can also be applied to describe transport experiments through quantum dots , where the localized spin-1/2 models a minimal two - state quantum dot which is coupled via exchange interactions to two ( or more ) leads held at different chemical potentials .",
    "the tremendous developments in the ability to engineer nanoscale devices also led to the experimental observation  @xcite of kondo physics in transport experiments .",
    "this in turn triggered many theoretical studies  @xcite of the non - equilibrium transport properties of kondo quantum dots .",
    "it is well - known that the kondo model with larger spin on the dot shows  @xcite strong deviations from standard fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures .",
    "for example , at low temperatures the local spin is not fully screened by the electrons and a residual magnetization remains . despite the recent observation of this underscreened kondo effect in transport experiments in single molecules  @xcite ,",
    "the non - equilibrium transport properties of the spin-1 kondo model have not been studied theoretically  @xcite in the same detail as its spin-1/2 counterpart .    in this article",
    "we fill this gap by performing a two - loop renormalization group ( rg ) analysis for a spin-1 kondo dot with finite bias voltage . to this end",
    "we apply the real - time renormalization group method in frequency space  @xcite ( rtrg - fs ) to derive analytic results for the renormalized magnetic field and g - factor , decay rates and time evolution as well as magnetization , anisotropy and differential conductance in the stationary state .",
    "all results are obtained in a systematic weak - coupling expansion in the renormalized exchange coupling @xmath0 .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied as long as the maximum of all occurring energy scales is much larger than the kondo temperature @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the applied bias voltage and magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath1 denotes the kondo temperature at which the system enters the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we find that the properties of the spin-1 kondo model are similar to the spin-1/2 system with the main differences ( i ) that the larger local hilbert space on the dot results in additional ( quintet ) decay rates beside the usual longitudinal and transverse spin relaxation rates , ( ii ) that these rates describe the decay of the spin anisotropy @xmath5 ( which is trivial in the spin-1/2 model ) , where @xmath6 are the components of the spin operator on the dot , and ( iii ) that the existence of these additional rates yields a broadening ( relative to the spin-1/2 model ) of logarithmic features in stationary quantities like the susceptibilities and the differential conductance .",

    "the physical origin of this jump is the onset of inelastic cotunneling processes : for finite magnetic field the spin states on the dot are separated by the energy @xmath80 .",
    "thus for @xmath215 only elastic cotunneling processes are possible in which electrons are transferred from the left to the right lead via virtual states on the dot without flipping its spin state .",

    "the transport properties of the spin-1/2 kondo dot have been studied previously using the same formalism  @xcite .",
    "the main difference in the spin-1 model is the appearance of three additional decay rates which govern the relaxation of the spin anisotropy @xmath232 on the dot , a quantity which becomes constant in the spin-1/2 model .",
    "hence the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization and current turns out to be much richer in the spin-1 model .",
    "furthermore the decay rates appear as cut - off parameters in the logarithmic terms of the perturbative expansions . as a consequence , the presence of additional rates leads to an enhanced broadening of the logarithmic corrections of stationary quantities like the susceptibility ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sus_limit ] ) and the differential conductance ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : conductance ] ) , which are thus less pronounced than in the spin-1/2 model .",
    "finally we note that as our approach is based on an expansion in the renormalized exchange coupling it is not possible to derive reliable results in the low - energy regime @xmath233 where the differences between the fully screened spin-1/2 model and the underscreened spin-1 model are most pronounced . as the underscreened kondo model can be mapped to an effective ferromagnetic kondo model , a perturbative study of the transport properties in this regime might be possible using a majorana diagramatic theory as recently performed for the investigation of the magnetotransport  @xcite .",
