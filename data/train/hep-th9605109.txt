    "the value of @xmath130 at the horizon decreases with increasing @xmath1 towards the limiting value of zero .",

    "the sequence of regular solutions converges to the `` extremal '' emd solution @xcite , which is also shown .",

    "2b , the region , where the eymd and emd functions closely agree , again increases exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "we observe again that strong deviations of the functions @xmath132 from the limiting function @xmath141 occur only in an interior region , decreasing exponentially with @xmath1 . in the vicinity of the innermost node @xmath158 of @xmath130",

    "further from the origin they approach the limiting emd function @xmath139 .",
    "the interior regions , where the functions @xmath131 deviate significantly from the limiting solution @xmath139 , are limited by the respective location of the innermost node @xmath158 of @xmath130 ( with the exception of @xmath162 ) .",

    "they deviate significantly from the limiting function in an interior region , extending slightly beyond the innermost node @xmath158 of @xmath130 ( with the exception of @xmath163 ) .",
    "turning now back to the eymd black hole solutions we observe , that the regular solutions have considerable influence on the black hole solutions for small horizon size and that the innermost nodes of the regular eymd gauge field functions largely determine the pattern of convergence .",
    "the location of these innermost nodes @xmath158 is presented in table  2 .",
    "in particular we note , that for the black hole solutions of figs .  1 , the location of the innermost node of the regular gauge field function with seven nodes is smaller than the event horizon @xmath128 .",

    ", we see that they are large at the horizon as long as the horizon is small compared to the location of the innermost node @xmath158 of the corresponding @xmath1-th regular gauge field function .",
    "thus @xmath164 are large at the horizon , whereas @xmath138 is small .",
    "consequently , @xmath138 deviates strongly from the limiting function only in the far region where , beyond the last node , it must approach its boundary value .",
    "the black hole dilaton functions @xmath131 deviate significantly from the limiting function only in the interior region between the event horizon and the location of the innermost node @xmath158 of the corresponding @xmath1-th regular gauge field function .",
    "thus there is no notable deviation left for @xmath140 .",
    "the same is true for the metric functions @xmath143 and @xmath145 .",

    "choosing different values for the event horizon @xmath13 we realize that the above observations are rather general .",
    "considering solutions with event horizon @xmath167 , we see that already the location of the innermost node of the fourth regular gauge field function is smaller than @xmath13",
    ". consequently , there are already for @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 no notable deviations from the limiting functions left .",
    "the convergence of the gauge field functions is somewhat slower , though @xmath171 is already small at the event horizon .",
    "increasing the event horizon further to @xmath172 , shows that only the location of the innermost ( and only ) node of the first regular solution is still larger than the event horizon .",
    "consequently , there are now already for @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 no notable deviations from the limiting functions left , while @xmath176 is small at the event horizon . for still larger horizons , @xmath177 ,",
