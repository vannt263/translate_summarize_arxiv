    "it is already more then hundred years to einstein s general relativity , but the extra - dimensional models are even older .",
    "indeed , the first attempt to construct extra - dimensional model was performed by nordstrm  @xcite in 1914 .",
    "it was a vector theory which unified nordstrm s second gravity theory  @xcite with maxwell s electromagnetism .",
    "back then einstein s general relativity ( gr ) has not been fully formulated yet and so it was natural that this kind of theory arises .",
    "later in 1915 einstein introduced his theory  @xcite , but still it took almost four years to prove that nordstrm s theory was wrong . during solar eclipse in 1919",
    "there were performed measurements of light bending near the sun and the deflection angle was in perfect agreement with gr while nordstrm s theory , being scalar gravity , predicted zeroth deflection angle .",
    "yet , the nordstrm s idea on extra dimensions remained and in 1919 kaluza proposed  @xcite similar model based on gr : in his model 5d einstein equations could be decomposed into 4d einstein equations plus maxwell s electromagnetism . in order to perform such decomposition ,",
    "extra dimension should be `` curled '' or compactified into a circle and `` cylindrical conditions '' should be imposed . later in 1926 ,",
    "klein introduced  @xcite nice quantum mechanical interpretation of this extra dimension and so the theory called kaluza - klein was formally formulated .",
    "back then their theory unified all known at that time interactions . with time , more interactions were known and it became clear that to unify them all more extra dimensions are needed . nowadays , one of the promising theories to unify all interactions is m / string theory .",
    "presence in the lagrangian of the corrections which are squared in curvature is one of the distinguishing features of the gravitational counterpart of string theories .",
    "indeed , scherk and schwarz  @xcite were first to discover the potential presence of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 terms in the lagrangian of the virasoro - shapiro model  @xcite .",
    "curvature squared term of the @xmath18 type appears  @xcite in the low energy limit of the @xmath19 heterotic superstring  @xcite to match the kinetic term for the yang - mills field .",
    "later it was demonstrated  @xcite that the only combination of quadratic terms that leads to ghost - free nontrivial gravitation interaction is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term :    @xmath20    this term , first found by lanczos  @xcite ( therefore it is sometimes referred to as the lanczos term ) is an euler topological invariant in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time , but not in ( 4 + 1 ) and higher dimensions .",
    "zumino  @xcite extended zwiebach s result on higher than squared curvature terms , supporting the idea that the low energy limit of the unified theory might have a lagrangian density as a sum of contributions of different powers of curvature . in this",
    "regard einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity could be seen as a subcase of more general lovelock gravity  @xcite , but in current paper we restrain ourselves with only quadratic corrections and so to egb case .",
    "theories with extra dimensions have one thing in common  one needs to explain where these additional dimensions are `` hiding '' in , as we do not sense them , at least with current level of experiments .",
    "one of the ways to `` hide '' extra dimensions , as well as to recover 4d physics is to build so - called `` spontaneous compactification '' solution .",
    "exact static solutions where the metric is a cross product of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional manifold and a constant curvature `` inner space '' , were discussed for the first time in  @xcite , but with ( 3 + 1)-dimensional manifold being actually minkowski ( the generalization for a constant curvature lorentzian manifold was done in  @xcite ) . in the context of cosmology , it is more interesting to consider a spontaneous compactification in the case where the four dimensional part is given by a friedmann - robertson - walker metric . in this case",
    "it is completely natural to consider also the size of the extra dimensions as time dependent rather then static .",
    "indeed in @xcite it was explicitly shown that in order to have a more realistic model one needs to consider the dynamical evolution of the extra dimensional scale factor as well . in  @xcite ,",
    "the equations of motion for compactification with both time dependent scale factors were written for arbitrary lovelock order in the special case of spatially flat metric ( the results were further proven in  @xcite ) .",
    "the results of  @xcite were reanalyzed for the special case of 10 space - time dimensions in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the existence of dynamical compactification solutions was studied with the use of hamiltonian formalism .",
    "more recently , efforts on finding spontaneous compactifications have been done in @xcite where the dynamical compactification of ( 5 + 1 ) einstein - gauss - bonnet model was considered , in @xcite with different metric _",
    "ansatz _ for scale factors corresponding to ( 3 + 1)- and extra dimensional parts , and in @xcite where general ( e.g. without any _ ansatz _ ) scale factors and curved manifolds were considered .",
    "also , apart from cosmology , the recent analysis focuses on properties of black holes in gauss - bonnet  @xcite and lovelock  @xcite gravities , features of gravitational collapse in these theories  @xcite , general features of spherical - symmetric solutions  @xcite and many others .    in the context of finding exact solutions , the most common _ ansatz _ used for the functional form of the scale factor is exponential or power law .",
    "exact solutions with exponential functions for both the ( 3 + 1)- and extra dimensional scale factors were studied for the first time in @xcite , and exponentially increasing ( 3 + 1)-dimensional scale factor and exponentially shrinking extra dimensional scale factor were described .",
    "power - law solutions have been analyzed in @xcite and more recently in  @xcite so that there is an almost complete description ( see also  @xcite for useful comments regarding physical branches of the solutions ) .",
    "solutions with exponential scale factors  @xcite have been studied in detail , namely , models with both variable  @xcite and constant  @xcite volume , developing a general scheme for constructing solutions in egb ; recently  @xcite this scheme was generalized for general lovelock gravity of any order and in any dimensions .",
    "also , the stability of the solutions was addressed in  @xcite , where it was demonstrated that only a handful of the solutions could be called `` stable '' while the remaining are either unstable or have neutral / marginal stability and so additional investigation is required .    in order to find all possible regimes of einstein - gauss - bonnet cosmology ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond an exponential or power law _",
    "ansatz _ and keep the functional form of the scale factor generic .",
    "of course in this case the equations of motion are much more complicated , but on the other hand , we are particularly interested in models which allow dynamical compactification , so it is natural to consider metric as a product of spatially three - dimensional part and extra - dimensional . in that case three - dimensional",
    "part represents `` our universe '' and we expect for this part to expand while extra dimensional part should be suppressed in size with respect to three - dimensional one . in @xcite",
    "it was found that there exists a phenomenologically sensible regime in the case when the curvature of the extra dimensions is negative and the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory does not admit a maximally symmetric solution . in this case",
    "the three dimensional hubble parameter and the extra dimensional scale factor asymptotically tend to the constant values . in @xcite a detailed analysis of the cosmological dynamics in this model with generic couplings",
    "was performed .",
    "recently this model was also studied in  @xcite where it was demonstrated that with an additional constraint on couplings friedmann - type late - time behavior could be restored .    in current paper , unlike  @xcite , we consider both manifolds ( three - dimensional and extra - dimensional ) to be spatially flat and , similar to  @xcite , put no _ ansatz _ on the behavior the of scale factors ; also , to be as general as possible , perform all the analysis analytically . in this paper",
    "we consider only vacuum model , so neither matter nor even a boundary term ( being just cosmological or @xmath21-term in the absence of curvature ) are considered  we leave it to future consideration in a separate papers .",
    "of particular relevance to our present analysis is  @xcite where authors performed numerical analysis of 5d egb model with @xmath22 splitting of the metric .",
    "their approach was different from ours and so they have lost one of the branches while we provide full analysis of the system .",
    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows : first we write down general equations of motion for einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , then we rewrite them for our symmetry _",
    "ansatz_. in the following sections we analyze them for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and general @xmath5 case , considering vacuum case in this paper only .",
    "each case is followed by a small discussion of the results and properties of this particular case ; after considering all cases we discuss their properties , generalities and differences , and draw conclusions .",
    "as mentioned above , we consider the spatially flat anisotropic cosmological model in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity without any matter source .",
    "the equations of motion for such model include both first and second lovelock contributions and could be easily derived from the general case ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    @xmath23 + 8\\alpha \\ [ \\sum\\limits_{j\\ne i } ( \\dot h_j + h_j^2 ) \\sum\\limits_{\\substack{\\{k > l\\ } \\\\",

    "n\\ } \\ne i } } h_k h_l h_m h_n \\ ] = 0 \\end{array } \\label{dyn_gen}\\ ] ]    as @xmath24th dynamical equation .",
    "the first lovelock term  einstein - hilbert contribution  is in first squared parenthesis and the second term ",
    "gauss - bonnet  is in second parenthesis ; @xmath6 is the coupling constant for gauss - bonnet contribution and we put the corresponding constant for einstein - hilbert contribution to unity .",
    "also , since we consider spatially flat cosmological model , scale factors do not hold much physical sense and the equations are rewritten in terms of hubble parameters @xmath25 . apart from the dynamical equations we write down a constraint equation    @xmath26    as mentioned in the introduction , we want to investigate the particular case with the scale factors splitted in two parts  separately 3 dimensions ( 3-dimensional isotropic subspace ) , which are suppose to represent our world and the remaining represent the extra dimensions ( @xmath1-dimensional isotropic subspace ) .",

    "we are going to study these four cases separately . as we mentioned in the introduction , in this paper we are going to consider only vacuum case ; the @xmath21-term case and possibly general case with perfect fluid with arbitrary equation of state we as well as effect of curvature are going to be considered in the following papers .",
    "in this case the equations of motion take form ( @xmath29-equation , @xmath31-equation and constraint correspondingly ) :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    from ( [ d1_con ] ) we can easily see that    @xmath39    so that @xmath29 and @xmath31 always have opposite sign for @xmath7 , but they could have same sign in @xmath8 case .",

    "this result is quite expected  from fig .",
    "[ d1l ] we can see that this is late - time regime and , with gauss - bonnet contribution being second order on curvature , its effect on the dynamics wear off at late times .",
    "hereafter we refer to this regime as @xmath56  kasner regime with @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath58 we have power - law behavior for both three - dimensional subspace with @xmath59 , and for extra - dimensional part with @xmath60 , so that we have gauss - bonnet kasner regime with @xmath61 and we denote it in a similar way as above  @xmath62  kasner regime with @xmath61 .",
    "there are no other regimes apart from these two for @xmath7 ( see fig .",

    "one can not miss that @xmath52 asymptotes valid also for @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ d1l](c ) ) , as well as for @xmath58 , so we denote them in the same way as in @xmath7 case .",
    "the point @xmath63 for @xmath8 in vacuum case is physical singularity ",
    "one can check that the equations of motion are discontinuous at that point and with @xmath31 , @xmath43 and @xmath40 divergent the components of riemann tensor are also divergent while @xmath29 remains regular .",
    "the last fact makes it similar to non - standard singularities , so we denote this regime as @xmath64 ( nonstandard singularity ) and we will discuss them in the discussion section .",
    "final asymptotic regime for vacuum case is the stable point @xmath65 with @xmath66 ( see fig .  [ d1l](c ) ) .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ d1_hh ] ) that @xmath67 so that it is isotropic solution .",

    "we can see that in this approach different exponential solutions are not `` mixing '' inside the same branch , unlike approach we used in the main text  for @xmath3 with `` usual '' approach both exponential solutions exist on the same @xmath75 branch ( see table  [ d.2 ] ) . also for illustration purposes we summarized all nonsingular regimes in table  [ d.add ] .",

    "this referred to a situation when some of the dynamical variables diverge while others are regular , at the same time curvature invariants diverge so it is a physical singularity ( say , `` suddenly '' , at some regular value of scale factor , curvature invariants diverge ) .",
    "this kind of singularity is `` weak '' by tipler s classification  @xcite , and `` type ii '' in classification by kitaura and wheeler  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the singularities of this kind in the cosmological context in lovelock and einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity demonstrates  @xcite that their presence is not suppressed and they are abundant for a wide range of initial conditions and parameters .",
    "this is especially true for bianchi - i - type ( i.e. where all scale factors are different ",
    "@xmath79 ) ( 4 + 1)-dimensional egb model  @xcite where it was demonstrated that in vacuum case recollapse and nonstandard singularities are the only options for future behavior .    before concluding our results , two important notes regarding the viability of the regimes must be done .",
    "first of them regards gr kasner regimes .",
    "we have found that @xmath2 gr kasner regime has @xmath53 , @xmath3 case ",
    "@xmath80 , and for @xmath4 it is detected that @xmath81 ; further , for general @xmath82 we derived    @xmath83    one can see that the resulting kasner exponent @xmath72 in @xmath56 gradually grows from @xmath84 till approximately @xmath85 , and that is kasner exponent which is detected by an observer living in @xmath86-dimensional space - time ( `` our universe '' ) . transfering kasner exponents to the expansion rate and remembering how scale factor depends on the equation of state in presence of the perfect fluid , we can write down @xmath87 , so @xmath88  effective equation of state which corresponds to the expansion rate .",
    "one can clearly see that for @xmath2 it is radiation ( @xmath89 ) and it becoming softer in the limit @xmath14 : @xmath90 .",
    "we can see that all of them are different from @xmath91 what one would assume from dust - dominated friedmann stage , so that dust - dominated friedmann behavior can not be restored ( unlike  @xcite where it could ) .",
    "the second note regards both kasner and exponential solutions and it is linked to the gauss - bonnet coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "as we demonstrated , kasner solutions exist for @xmath7 at low @xmath1 and for @xmath8 at high @xmath1 ; isotropic exponential solutions exist only for @xmath8 while anisotropic  only for @xmath7 . so that if there were a bounds on @xmath6 , we could reject some of the regimes .",
    "and the situation with bounds on @xmath6 are the following  from consideration of shear viscosity to entropy ratio as well as casuality violations and cfts in dual gravity description there were obtained limits on @xmath6 for 5d that @xmath92  @xcite and @xmath93  @xcite ; later they were updated for 7d  @xcite @xmath94 and eventually for any @xmath1  @xcite ( with the upper limit found earlier in  @xcite ) :    @xmath95    from these constraints one can clearly see that we can not abandon either @xmath7 or @xmath8 ; study of gb superconductors  @xcite also do not allow to discard either possibility .",
    "considering black holes instabilities in 5d allow to lower upper limit to @xmath96  @xcite but it is still remains positive while in  @xcite @xmath7 brought some instabilities .",
    "overall , from all these studies we can not disregard neither @xmath7 nor @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider heterotic strings setup and so identify @xmath6 with inverse string tension ( see  @xcite ) , then we should use @xmath7 only . in that case",
    "( if we restrain us with @xmath7 only ) the only regimes which are viable are : kasner transitions @xmath77 in @xmath9 and kasner to anisotropic exponential transitions @xmath97 in @xmath98 .",
    "it is time to draw conclusions to the results of this paper .",
    "as we mention in the introduction , when looking for the exact solutions in egb and lovelock gravity , usually power - law and exponential _ ansatz _ are considered .",
    "we have demonstrated that this approach is just  at least in egb case and at least when looking for the solutions which allow dynamical compactification .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated analytically that there are no nonsingular regimes apart from power - law and exponential . and of power - law regimes , only kasner regime is achieved ( see  @xcite for ( un)viability of another power - law regime ) . as of exponential regimes ,",
    "their appearance , abundance and stability is in total agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "we have described distribution of all nonsingular regimes over branches and initial conditions .",
    "as we already mentioned , there are only two viable regimes ",
    "@xmath77 kasner regime and @xmath97 kasner - to - exponential transition .",
    "the former of them occur for @xmath7 at low @xmath99 and for @xmath8 at high @xmath98 ( at @xmath3 it exist for both sings of @xmath6 ) . on the contrary , anisotropic exponential solution stable for @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( it corresponds to the expansion of our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional universe  that is what we observe and contraction of extra dimensions",
    " we do not sense them ) only for @xmath7 .    to summarize the regimes , for @xmath7 we have anisotropic exponential solutions at @xmath98 ( there is no such solution for @xmath2 ) as well as kasner regime at @xmath9 . on the contrary , for @xmath8 we have only kasner regime for @xmath98 and",
    "so there is no viable regime for @xmath2 .",
    "as we discussed earlier , current limits on @xmath6 allow both signs so one needs to use additional reasoning to set either @xmath7 ( like appealing to inverse string tension in heterotic string theories ) or @xmath8 .    as we mentioned in the beginning , this is the first paper of the series , and we are about to finish similar paper but with boundary ( cosmological , or @xmath21 ) term taken into account .",
    "indeed , @xmath21-term case is broader and probably could offer more abundant dynamics , not to mention that one of the interpretations of current accelerated expansion of the universe is the @xmath21-term . in future",
    "we are also going to consider matter in the form of the perfect fluid and probably the curvature of the manifolds .",
    "the former of them could change late - time asymptote for kasner regime  we demonstrated that depending on @xmath1 late - time power - law regime @xmath102 has @xmath103 , which contradict observations .",
    "so we hope that the addition of matter in form of the perfect fluid could change this asymptote to favored by observations . as of the case with curved manifolds",
    ", we have considered that case numerically in  @xcite but analytical consideration is always more reliable ."
