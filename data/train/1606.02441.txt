    "the large hadron collider @xcite is equipped with dedicated detectors allowing measurements of protons scattered in diffractive or electromagnetic interactions .",
    "since the scattering angles of such protons are very small , these detectors are installed very far away from the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "in addition , due to the use of the roman pot technology , they can be placed very close to the proton beams .",
    "the lhc physics program is not solely devoted to the studies of the proton  proton interactions .",
    "possibilities of accelerating heavy ion beams have already resulted in many measurements of proton  lead and lead  lead collisions @xcite .",
    "an ultra - relativistic interaction of two heavy nuclei is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : aa_interaction ] .",
    "typically , the impact parameter has a non - zero value and only a part of the nucleons constituting one nucleus collides with a part the nucleons of the other nucleus .",
    "the nucleons actively participating in the interaction are called the participant nucleons ( or participants ) , in contrast to the spectator nucleons ( spectators ) .",
    "since the time - scale of the ultra - relativistic ion collision is much shorter than that of the interactions within the nucleus , the spectators are essentially left intact during the nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "they are scattered into the accelerator beam pipe and escape the acceptance of the detectors , very much like diffractive protons .",
    "the present work tries to answer whether and to what extent the forward proton detectors at the lhc could be used with heavy ion beams .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : detectors ] the forward proton detectors at the lhc are introduced .",
    "section [ sec : methodology ] describes the methodology of the presented study .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] and the conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "several systems of forward proton detectors are installed at the lhc .",
    "these are : totem  @xcite , ct - pps  @xcite , alfa  @xcite and afp  @xcite .",
    "all these detectors are placed about 200 m away from their corresponding interaction points .",
    "the alfa detectors approach the beams in the vertical direction , the afp and ct - pps approach horizontally , while totem has both types of detectors .",
    "the present analysis focusses on the afp detectors .",
    "however , the results for other horizontal ones can be expected qualitatively similar .",
    "the potential application of the vertical detectors is not to be covered within this work .",
    "the afp ( atlas forward proton ) detectors @xcite are a sub - system of the atlas experiment set - up located at the lhc interaction point 1 .",
    "it is foreseen to consist of four stations ",
    "two on each outgoing beam .",
    "the near stations will be placed 205 m and the far ones 217  m away from the interaction point .",
    "one arm of the afp detector system , the stations on one side of the ip1 , has already been installed .",
    "the installation of the other arm is planned for the 2016/2017 lhc technical stop .",
    "each afp station consists of a roman pot mechanism allowing for the horizontal insertion of the detectors into the accelerator beam pipe .",
    "each station contains a tracking detector of four planes of the 3d silicon sensors @xcite .",
    "additionally , the far stations will be equipped with quartz - based cherenkov time - of - flight counters . however ,",
    "these counters are not relevant for the present study .",
    "a diffractively scattered proton , before being detected in afp , passes through the magnetic fields of seven lhc magnets .",
    "q3 triplet of quadrupole magnets is responsible for the final focusing and the emittance matching of the beams , providing thus the high luminosity .",
    "the two consecutive magnets are the dipoles : d1 and d2 .",
    "they separate the incoming and the outgoing beams and accommodate them within the corresponding beam pipes of the machine .",
    "the last two quadrupole magnets , q5 and q6 , are used to match the beam optics in the interaction region to the rest of the ring .",
    "the momentum of the diffractively scattered proton slightly differs from that of the beam proton . in the interaction",
    "the proton looses a part of its energy and its transverse momentum is , on the average , increased .",
    "it should be recalled that the distribution of the transverse momentum of diffractively scattered protons is very steep .",
    "therefore , it is the scattered proton energy which mainly determines its trajectory and the position in the detector .",
    "the transverse momentum of a typical magnitude only leads to a moderate smearing of this position .",
    "lower energy of the diffractive proton means that the curvature of its trajectory in the magnetic field will be greater , which will cause the scattered proton to recede from the beam orbit .",
    "this property allows the measurement of such protons with detectors placed close to the beam . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] shows the trajectories of protons with different energy values , here specified by the relative energy loss @xmath0 .",
    "also , the lhc magnets and the afp detector are depicted in this figure .    the kinematic range in which the measurements are possible can be quantified by the value of the geometric acceptance as a function of the proton energy and its transverse momentum ( here the acceptance is averaged over the azimuthal angle ) . naturally , the acceptance depends on the exact settings of the magnetic fields , the so - called machine optics , and on the beam  detector distance .",
    "[ fig : proton_acceptance ] presents an exemplary acceptance plot , calculated for 7  tev proton beams and the @xmath1  m lhc optics @xcite .",
    "the presented results were obtained with the mad - x programme @xcite .",
    "one can see that the afp detectors allow an efficient measurement of protons that lost between 3% and 12% of its energy and gained less than 2.5  gev of transverse momentum .",
    "the spectator nucleons after an interaction of ultra - relativistic heavy ions are left in a very peculiar state . before the collision",
    "the nucleons were a part of the nucleus , interacting with other nucleons belonging to it .",
    "then , the participating nucleons are `` taken away '' and the spectators are left as members of a highly excited ensemble , which subsequently decays into lighter fragments .",
    "the discussion concerning the details of this process is outside the scope of the present study , see for example @xcite and references therein . in the following it is assumed that all the nuclei lighter than the projectiles can possibly be produced without paying any attention to the abundances of particular isotopes .",
    "next , it is studied which of the produced nuclei could be detected by the afp system .",
    "since the detectors are positioned quite far away from the interaction region , it is worth checking which produced nuclei have a chance to reach the afp stations before they decay .",
    "the spectators move with velocity close to the speed of light and their lorentz factor is @xmath2 ( for the lead beam and the lhc magnets set as for 6500 gev proton beams ) .",
    "then , the proper time of a nucleus before it reaches the afp detector is less than a nanosecond",
    "[ fig : decay ] presents the half - life times of the known nuclei and the difference of the number of neutrons , n , and the atomic number , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass number . ] .",
    "it is clear that the vast majority of the nuclei could reach the detectors .",
    "if one neglects the internal motion of nucleons within the nucleus , then all the nucleons carry the same energy equal to the energy of the beam divided by the mass number of the beam particles : @xmath5 .",
    "assuming that the spectators are left intact in the collision , a nuclear fragment with mass number @xmath4 consisting of the spectators would have the energy equal to @xmath6 .    in order to take into account the internal motion of nucleons , the fermi - gas model of a nucleus",
    "was employed . in the rest frame of the nucleus",
    ", the density of nucleon states is given by @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , in the simulation the absolute value of the momentum of each nucleon was randomly drawn from a quadratic distribution between zero and the fermi momentum of 250  mev .",
    "the direction of each momentum was assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the momentum of a given fragment was calculated as a vector sum of momenta of all its nucleons . finally ,",
    "the nucleus momentum was lorentz - transformed into the laboratory frame .",
    "it is worth to emphasize the main points of the presented methodology .",
    "first , no physical model of the nuclear debris production is used .",
    "this is a clear drawback , because the results will not say whether the afp detectors are expected to register anything .",
    "however , such models would require extrapolations of the low energy measurements and it is not certain that such an extrapolation would provide reliable results .",
    "on the other hand , with the approach chosen here , the results are essentially model independent and can be applied on top of any particular model .",
    "the only exception are the small details of the fermi motion , where possible collective movements inside the nuclei are neglected . however",
    ", this can only have a small effect on the presented results .    in order to simulate the transport of the nuclei through the accelerator structures",
    "a simple observation was employed : the trajectory in the magnetic field depends on the ratio of the particle momentum to its charge .",
    "therefore , the trajectory of a particle with momentum @xmath8 and charge @xmath9 is the same as the trajectory of the beam particle with charge @xmath10 and momentum : @xmath11 assuming @xmath9 and @xmath10 have the same sign , which is true for all nuclei .",
    "results presented below were obtained assuming that the beam of fully ionised ions is accelerated to the energy of 2.56 tev per nucleon , which corresponds to 6.5 tev energy protons . during the lhc run 2 , the data - taking involving the heavy ion beams is performed with the @xmath12  m optics  @xcite .",
    "neglecting the spreads due to the beam emittance and the fermi motion , a nucleus with a given @xmath4 and @xmath13 numbers will hit the afp detectors in a well defined position . since the afp detectors approach the beam in the horizontal direction , it is the @xmath14 coordinate of the nuclear fragment trajectory which plays the major role in the present considerations .",
    "one should recall that for the safety reasons the detector is positioned at some distance with respect to the beam and that there is additional dead material of the roman pot floor .",
    "[ fig : positions ] shows the horizontal positions of the nuclei at 211 m from the interaction point ( in the middle between the two afp stations ) within the accelerator beam pipe .",
    "the position of ( @xmath15 ) and all nuclei with the same @xmath16 ratio ( _ i.e. _ the same @xmath17 ratio ) is equal to zero .",
    "nuclei with less neutrons per proton are deflected outside the lhc ring , similarly to diffractive protons , and can be registered the afp detectors .",
    "nuclei containing more neutrons per proton are deflected towards the lhc centre escaping the detection .",
    "nuclei with @xmath16 very different from lead can be lost in the lhc apertures and do not reach 211 m at all .    for the emittance value of 1.233  @xmath18 m @xcite",
    "the lead beams at the interaction point have angular spread of 24  @xmath18rad , while the interaction vertex distribution has the transverse spread of 13  @xmath18 m and the longitudinal one of 5.5  cm .",
    "the horizontal width of the beam at 211  m from the interaction point , @xmath19 , is equal to 134  @xmath18 m .",
    "this width is a usual unit of the distance between the detector and the beam . in the following",
    ", it was assumed that the sensitive area of the sensor is placed 3  mm from the centre of the beam .",
    "this distance covers about @xmath20 and a 0.5 mm - long distance between the active detector edge and outer side of the roman pot floor .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] shows the acceptance to detect a given nucleus as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the obtained results were averaged over the distributions of momenta discussed before and the gaussian spreads of the lhc beams ( spatial and angular ) .",
    "the observed shape is in agreement with what one would expect from fig .",
    "[ fig : positions ] .",
    "although , the afp detectors were not designed and build to detect the nuclear debris , their acceptance covers a significant part of the nuclei spectrum .",
    "this is particularly true for the heavier nuclei , where for a given @xmath13 more than a half of known nuclei can be potentially detected . with decreasing @xmath13 value the range of the accepted masses linearly",
    "decreases .",
    "a study of the influence of various spreads on the position of selected ions at the distance of 211 m away from the ip is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : effects ] . as can be observed the effects of the beam spreads and those due to the transverse component of the fermi motion",
    "are rather small , but clearly visible .",
    "the ion position smearing is dominated by the longitudinal fermi motion magnified by the lorentz boost .",
    "one can observe that this effect is stronger for lighter nuclear debris .",
    "a natural question arises whether it is possible to improve or modify the afp acceptance to measure the spectator fragments .",
    "one key parameter is the distance between the detectors and the centre of the beam . with detectors operating at a smaller distance , the acceptance for nuclei with higher @xmath16 ratio",
    "would be increased .",
    "another option would be a modification of the machine optics , which may be considered in the future , if the measurements proposed in this paper prove useful .",
    "if the aim of the measurement would be to study the abundances of different nuclei , yet another possibility to modify the acceptance region would be to change the beam ions .",
    "then , the @xmath22 positions would be defined by a different @xmath16 value , and the acceptance would change accordingly . fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance_xxx ] presents the acceptance regions accessible when beams of , and are accelerated to energies equivalent to 6.5  tev protons .",
    "it was assumed that the optics is the same for all those scenarios .",
    "it is a reasonable assumption , since the acceptance is determined mainly by the beam separation magnets , which are set the same for all optics .",
    "furthermore , the optics for @xmath23 and @xmath24 running at the lhc is very similar , so one should not expect problems for other beam ions either . it can be observed that with the machine settings mentioned above the acceptance extends towards lower @xmath16 values .",
    "an extension toward larger @xmath16 would be very difficult , since no appropriate stable nuclei exist .",
    "the and nuclei were chosen as examples , since they are stable and together with they cover a very large region .",
    "in the presented study it was shown that the existing forward proton detectors at the lhc provide an interesting possibility of detecting nuclear debris emerging from the collision of two heavy ions .",
    "this possibility could be used for a measurement of abundances of various nuclei produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "another interesting goal would be a measurement of the centrality of the collision .",
    "different centralities would result in different signals generated by the created nuclear debris .",
    "such a measurement would be independent of and complementary to other commonly used methods ( we leave this topic for a next study ) .",
    "the standard methods of the centrality measurement can only be used to compare the centrality of two given events .",
    "such a procedure does not provide the absolute scale and leads to the concept of the _ centrality bins_. obviously , the present set - up of the afp detectors alone would not help .",
    "however , it is possible to consider similar detectors located in other places , in order to extend the joined acceptance to the whole spectrum of nuclei .",
    "this , together with the zero degree calorimeters measuring the neutrons emitted in the extreme forward direction , could provide a direct measurement of the number of spectators and hence , allow the determination of the number of participants , see also  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the presently used methods , such a measurement could be model independent .",
