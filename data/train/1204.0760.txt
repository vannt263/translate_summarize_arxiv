    "extreme - order statistics , dealing with distributions of largest , second - largest values , etc .",
    ", in a random sample @xcite , has not received much attention in quantum theory .",
    "however , statistics of outliers can be striking in a many - worlds scenario , due to the huge number of branches , providing the statistics is of the power - law type .",
    "if a random draw of some information - related quantity is made in each branch , the excess @xmath0 of the largest over the second - largest draw would be huge .",
    "that excess exponentiates to @xmath1 if information is processed in qubits , each of which has two hilbert - space dimensions .",
    "thus , using the dimension as a weight of a branch @xcite , the weight of the extremal branch may exceed by far the total weight of all other branches .",
    "this might be a realisation , for an entire history of an observer rather than for a single measurement , of the idea that `` massive redundancy can cause certain information to become objective , at the expense of other information '' @xcite .",
    "the many - worlds scenario @xcite is implicit in decoherence theory @xcite which has been able to explain why macroscopic superpositions evolve , rapidly , into states with the properties of classical statistical ensembles .",
    "there remains , however , the `` problem of outcomes '' @xcite : why is it that an observer of a superposition always finds himself ending up in a pure state instead of a mixture ?",
    "the problem is not with objective facts , but with the consciousness of the observer . for , if any statement is derived from observations alone , it can only involve observations from one branch of the world because of vanishing matrix elements between different branches .",
    "nowhere on the branching tree an objective contradiction arises . as to a conscious observer , however ,",
    "we can not tell by present knowledge whether he needs to `` observe '' his various branches in order to become aware of them , or whether it suffices for him to `` be '' the branches , whatever that means in physical terms @xcite . in the model constructed below",
    ", the `` observer '' could in principle be aware of all of his branches , but , due to statistics of extremes under a power law , this amounts to being aware of one extremal branch plus fringe effects .",
    "we shall be modelling , rather abstractly , an observer `` as a finite information - processing structure '' @xcite , with an emphasis on `` processing '' , because it means nothing to the observer if a bit of information `` has '' a certain value unless the value is revealed by interaction .",
    "we shall take a history - based approach mainly for reasons of extreme - value statistics under a power - law : outliers are most pronounced in large random samples , suggesting to use as a sample the entire branching tree .",
    "in addition , `` the history of a brain s functioning is an essential part of its nature as an object on which a mind supervenes '' @xcite .",
    "ideally , a model of quantum measurement would be based on some hamiltonian without explicit time dependence ; in particular , without an external random process in time .",
    "such an approach via the schrdinger equation , however , would be hindered by difficulties in solving the equation .",
    "we shall greatly simplify our task by considering time evolution only in discrete steps , and by constructing a unitary operator directly for a time step .",
    "it would be possible , though of little use , to identify a hamiltonian generating the evolution operator .",
    "a further simplification will be to consider evolution only during an observer s lifetime .",
    "if we describe measurements in the aforementioned way , we must show how stochastic behaviour can emerge _ in the observation _ of quantum systems",
    ". it will be sufficient to use random numbers in the construction of the time - step operator , in presumed approximation to real - world dynamical complexity . under repeated application of the ( constant ) operator ,",
    "evolution is deterministic in principle .",
    "when the application is to a particular initial state , however , the built - in randomness becomes effective .",
    "the evolution operator is constructed as a product of unitaries .",
    "this facilitates evaluations ; in particular , it enables a straightforward definition of `` conscious dimension '' .",
    "the scenario of the model is as follows .",
    "a quantum system is composed of a record - generating part , like some kind of moving body ; of records keeping track of the motion ; and of subsystems associated with the records , allowing for demolition - free reading .",
    "the observer appears through the subsystems and through part of the evolution operator . at his `` birth '' ,",
    "all records are in blank states , while the record - generating body is in some quasiclassical state which _ determines _ the subsequent evolution .",
    "the evolution operator provides four kinds of event : quasiclassical motion for most of the time , accompanied by the writing of records ; dating of records by conservative ageing ; splitting of the motion into a superposition of two equal - amplitude branches at certain points of the body s orbit ; and the reading of records by a `` scattering '' interaction with the subsystems of the records .",
    "random elements in the evolution are : duration of quasiclassical sections ; the states of the body at which evolution continues after a split ; and most crucially , the number of records being recalled within a timestep . for the latter number , a power - law distribution is assumed .",
    "no attempt is made here to justify the distribution ",
    "it should be regarded as a working hypothesis for the purpose of demonstrating the potential relevance of power - law statistics for quantum measurement .",
    "the state of superposition , emerging by repeated steps of evolution from an initial state of the chosen variety , can be made explicit to a sufficient degree .",
    "it can be put in correspondence with a branching tree of the general statistical theory of branching processes .",
    "statistical independence as required by that theory is exactly satisfied by the model evolution , due to random draws employed in constructing the evolution operator .",
    "consciousness is assumed to reside in unitary rotations of the recalling subsystems of the records , triggered when a record of a special class is encountered .",
    "the trigger is associated with a random draw determining the number of `` redundant '' records to be processed .",
    "somewhere on the branching tree ( that is , in some factor of the tensor products superposed ) that number takes the extremal value .",
    "because of the branching structure , the probability is large for that value to occur near the end of an observer s lifetime .",
    "hence , it singles out ( almost ) an entire history . a study into the probability distribution for the difference between the largest and the second - largest draw finally shows that the dimension of the subspace affected by conscious rotations in all branches of the superposition is almost certainly exhausted by the dimension of conscious rotations in the extremal branch .",
    "the `` objective '' factors of the evolution operator are constructed in sections [ secqclstates ] to [ secdating ] .",
    "their effect on the initial state is evaluated in section [ secthesuperposition ] .",
    "conscious processing of records is modelled in section [ secrr ] , while its statistics is analysed in section [ secextremalbranch ] .",
    "section [ born ] shows how the model would generalise to branching with non - equal amplitudes or into more than two branches .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "a basic assumption of the model is that for all but a sparse subset of time steps , evolution is quasi - classical , like a moving body represented by a coherent state .",
    "evolution on such a section is determined by a small set of dynamical variables , while a large number of `` redundant '' records is written along the path . in the model s approximation ,",
    "instantaneous dynamical variables are represented by one number from the orbital set @xmath2 the ordering is such that quasi - classical evolution takes the record - generating system from index @xmath3 to index @xmath4 within a step of time .",
    "the corresponding basis vectors of the record - generating system are denoted by @xmath5 they are assumed to be orthonormal .",
    "states of a record represented by @xmath6 dots on a circle , ageing ( without loss of information ) under repeated writing operations . ]",
    "the focus of the model is on an observer s interaction with records generated during his personal history .",
    "the term `` record '' will refer to observer s individual memories as well as to more objective forms of recording .",
    "moreover , it will be convenient to use the term `` record '' as an abbreviation for `` recording unit '' .",
    "thus , records can be in `` blank '' or `` written '' states .",
    "each recording unit @xmath7 decomposes into a subsystem holding the information , and another subsystem allowing the observer to interactively read the information without destroying it .",
    "the information consists , firstly , of some quality represented by the index of the record , and secondly , in the time of recording , or rather the age of the record .",
    "the age is encoded in canonical basis vectors as follows .",
    "@xmath8 this is illustrated in figure [ recordageing ] .",
    "the information about age will be crucial for composing an observer s conscious history by one extremal reading . only ages up to @xmath9 steps of time are possible , which is sufficient if we are dealing with a single observer .",
    "both the generation of a record and its ageing can be described by a writing operation @xmath10 .",
    "acting on an indicated record , it acts on the first factor of ( [ defrecordstate ] ) according to @xmath11 the second of these equalities is unwarranted , expressing an erasure of the record and thus limiting the model to less than @xmath6 steps of time , but there does not seem to be any better choice consistent with unitarity . obviously , writing operations on different records commute , @xmath12    to allow for the observer s conscious interaction with a record , a two - dimensional factor space is provided , vaguely representing the firing and resting states of a neuron .",
    "reading is modelled as a scattering of some unit vector @xmath13 into some other unit vector @xmath14 , in a way that could , in an extended model , depend on the index and the age of the record . in the present model , only dimensions will be counted , so no further specification of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is required .",
    "the hilbert space of a single record is thus spanned by product vectors of the form @xmath15 the hilbert space of all records possible is spanned by product vectors @xmath16 where @xmath17 , in view of the redundancy required , is much larger than @xmath18 .",

    ", the assumed initial state can be written as @xmath22 this choice of an initial state will imply that , in the terms of @xcite , we are restricting to a `` branching - state ensemble '' .",
    "such a restriction is necessary for pseudorandom behaviour to emerge under evolution by repeated action of a unitary time - step operator .",
    "by contrast , eigenstates of that operator would evolve without any randomness .",
    "@xmath23 is located on some string of quasiclassical events , as defined in section [ secrs ] .",
    "it is this string , chosen out of many similar ones , that acts as a `` seed '' which determines the observer s pseudo - random history .",
    "the idea of quasiclassical evolution , assumed to prevail for most of the time , is @xmath24 in a timestep ( section [ secqclstates ] ) .",
    "this is to be accompanied by the writing of records .",
    "when the record - generating system is in the state @xmath25 we assume that writing operations @xmath26 act on all records @xmath7 whose indices , or addresses , are in a set @xmath27 .",
    "while these records are redundant , we assume that @xmath3 can be retrieved from each of them , which requires @xmath28 when the record - generating system arrives at an index @xmath3 in a sparse subset @xmath29 , we assume that a superposition of two branches ( `` up '' and `` down '' ) is formed , with equal amplitudes in both branches .",
    "quasiclassical evolution is assumed to jump from @xmath3 to @xmath30 or @xmath31 , respectively , and continue there , as illustrated in figure [ splittingevolution ] .",
    "( a ) sections of quasi - classical evolution ( thick lines ) which , when an index in the set @xmath32 is encountered , split into superpositions of continued quasi - classical evolution .",

    "@xmath163{100mm}{hilbert - space dimension of the tensor factors rotating under                                   $ u_\\mathrm{c}$ while the remainder of factors is constant.}\\ ] ] the number of tensor factors rotating in a branch is @xmath150 , as defined in equation ( [ defr ] ) , so the dimension of the conscious subspace in a branch is @xmath164 .",
    "it should be noted that the subspace as such _ depends _ on the vectorial value taken by the nonrotating factors .",
    "the proposition of the paper is that the conscious dimension in the branch with the largest @xmath150 exceeds , by a huge factor @xmath165 , the sum of conscious dimensions in all other branches .",
    "the latter sum can be estimated , denoting by @xmath166 the number of branches ( terms of superposition ) at time @xmath38 , as @xmath167 evaluating this would require a joint distribution of @xmath150 , @xmath141 , and @xmath168 , so a more convenient estimate , using @xmath169 , is @xmath170 taking binary logarithms , the customised proposition is that the last term in the equation @xmath171 almost certainly takes a large value . by ( [ frechetseparation ] ) , @xmath172 ,",
    "so the relevant cumulative distribution function is obtained from ( [ jointprobabilityyd ] ) as @xmath173 substituting @xmath174 and putting @xmath175 in the lower limit of integration , the integral becomes @xmath176 asymptotically for @xmath177 , which represents an exponentially grown number of branches , the integral simplifies to @xmath178 because @xmath179 has the uniformly bounded derivative @xmath180 ( see text following ( [ frechetseparation ] ) ) while @xmath181 converges for @xmath182 in the range given by ( [ akpowerlaw ] ) and the coefficients @xmath183 and @xmath184 become vanishingly small . inserting @xmath185 from ( [ differencerescaled ] ) , and @xmath186 from ( [ deff3 ] ) , the cumulative distribution function for the excess factor @xmath165 is given by @xmath187 due to logarithmation , followed by a rescaling which broadens the distribution by a large factor , @xmath165 almost certainly takes a huge value , rather independently of the exact form of the distribution function @xmath188 .",
    "in section [ secrs ] the wavefunction is modelled to split in two branches with equal amplitudes .",
    "born s rule is trivially satisfied in this case . does the model generalise correctly to a splitting with unequal amplitudes ?",
    "technically , this is accomplished by a unitary transformation devised in @xcite which entangles a two - state superposition with a large number of auxiliary states so as to form another equal - amplitude superposition .",
    "it will be argued that in this way the model scenario is consistent with born s rule in general .",
    "the crucial point here is that `` if you believe in determinism , you have to believe it all the way '' @xcite . when an observer encounters a wavefunction for a measurement , like @xmath189 that wavefunction is given to him by the total operator of evolution .",
    "the operator is thus only required to handle wavefunctions that it provides itself . extending the model accordingly",
    "would be based on the following considerations .    in the course of measurement ,",
    "a result @xmath190 or @xmath191 is obtained , but it always comes with many irrelevant properties of the constituents , like the number of photons scattered off the apparatus , the number of observer s neurons firing , etc .",
    "let @xmath40 be the number of irrelevant properties to be taken into account .",
    "then , after the measurement , we have a state vector of the form @xmath192 the measuring evolution should commute with the projections on the spaces defined by @xmath190 and @xmath191 , so we have constraints on the absolute values , @xmath193 on the other hand , state vectors differing only in the phases of the @xmath194 can be regarded as equivalent for the measurement process , as has been shown by different arguments in @xcite and @xcite , and elaborately in @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath3-properties in ( [ result+irrelevants ] ) are `` irrelevant '' , we expect the evolution to produce a state belonging to the equivalence class at the peak number of representatives . a measure of this number is given by the surface element in the space of @xmath40-dimensional normalised states @xmath195 which is defined uniquely , up to a constant , by its invariance under unitary changes of basis for the span of the vectors .",
    "the number of representatives is obtained by integrating over the phases , which gives @xmath196 at the maximum , all moduli must be nonzero because of the @xmath197 factors .",
    "it follows by the permutation symmetry of constraints ( [ ckconstraint ] ) that @xmath198 finally extremising in the parameter @xmath110 , by extremising the product of moduli in ( [ cksurface ] ) we find @xmath199 so the number @xmath110 of branches with property @xmath190 equals @xmath200 . a similar argument , with a discussion of fluctuations about the maximum ,",
    "was given for a different scenario in @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ result+irrelevants ] ) and ( [ ckspecified ] ) , in conjunction with an arbitrary choice of phases , like @xmath201 , now specify the state vector that an evolution operator for a measurement should generate .    instead of splitting into `` up '' and `` down '' branches we now have splitting into @xmath40 branches , of which @xmath110 correspond to result @xmath190 of the measurement , and @xmath202 to result @xmath191 .",
    "information about @xmath190 or @xmath191 can be regarded as implicit in the indices of the records , so parameter",
    "@xmath110 need not even appear . in the equations of section [ secconstruction ] the following replacements have to be made . in ( [ defuo ] )",
    ", @xmath203 extends to a sum over @xmath40 equal parts . in ( [ register ] ) the entries @xmath204 of the register change to @xmath205 , and the same holds for the address sets ( [ aksuperposition ] ) .",
    "normalisation factors change from @xmath206 to @xmath207 in equations ( [ defuo ] ) and ( [ urwspsi ] ) . in section [ secextremalbranch ]",
    "the nonzero branching probabilities become @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and all powers of 2 change to powers of @xmath40 .",
    "observer s consciousness playing a role in the projection postulate has been pondered since the beginnings of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "the model presented here is a proposal of how the idea might be realised , albeit with modifications , in a framework of unitary quantum - mechanical evolution . in the model scenario ,",
    "the projection involved is on the conscious subspace at the time of the extremal draw as defined in section [ secconsciousdimension ] .",
    "but this projection assigns an outcome , `` up '' or `` down '' , not only to a single measurement ( or quantum event , as it was called here ) but to all measurements of an observer s lifetime .",
    "moreover , an assumption on statistics in the dynamics of consciousness was crucial to the functioning of the model",
    ". it might be objected then that we have only replaced the projection postulate with a statistical postulate based on speculation about consciousness .",
    "but there are well - known mechanisms for generating power - law statistics , some of which may be adaptable so as replace the postulate by the workings of an extended model . for the present model",
    ", it was important also to demonstrate that the preconditions of extreme - order theorems can be realised _",
    "exactly _ in a framework of unitary evolution .",
    "this was made obvious by employing random draws in the construction of the time - step operator .",
    "a rather complicated part in that construction , section [ retrieverecords ] , was to identify by backward branching the records that had a chance to be written before a given record .",
    "this might suggest to alternatively _ accumulate _ the extremal value in the course of evolution .",
    "but `` when the sum of [  ] independent heavy - tail random variables is large , then it is very likely that only one summand is large '' @xcite , so the alternative approach is very likely to reduce to the one already taken .",
    "a scenario of consciousness , all generated by one extremal event in a short interval of time , may also contribute to improving the physical notion of the metaphysical present . in the physical approach",
    ", time is parameterised by the reading of a clock , and it is possible to quantify the time intervals of cognitive processing .",
    "but outside the science community , such an approach is often felt to inadequately represent the existential quality of a moment .",
    "the model scenario would suggest a more complex relation to physical time .",
    "physicswise , it is a moment indeed , but since it covers all individual experience , the moment appears to be lasting",
    ".    the undifferentiated usage of `` consciousness '' in this paper will be unsatisfactory from a biological or psychological point of view , although consciousness as a processing of memories was discussed first in those fields @xcite .",
    "for the present purpose , the meaning of the term was defined in section [ secconsciousdimension ] . as a consequence ,",
    "activities of an observer which are conscious in the usual sense had to be regarded as `` unconscious '' .",
    "apparently , various levels of consciousness should be taken into account by an extended model ."
