    "nonmagnetic impurities on the surface of a ti have been shown to induce localized impurity resonances , with the impurity resonance energy scaling as @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thus a vacancy , where @xmath20 approaches infinity , gives a resonance at the dirac point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](a ) for the non - interacting case .",
    "finite impurity concentrations lead to a double - peak resonance , which narrows with decreasing concentration ( cp .",
    "black and blue ) .",
    "it also shifts the resonance slightly past the original dirac point , since potential impurities induce a small residual overall doping into the system @xcite .",
    "a resonance peak firmly located at the dirac point for finite supercells thus requires a large but finite @xmath20 ( cyan ) .",
    "the large dos around the fermi level close to a strong potential impurity fundamentally changes the sensitivity to interaction effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](b ) we show how the resonance peak changes between the non - interacting case ( black ) and @xmath34 ( blue , cyan ) .",
    "the resonance peak splits into two spin - polarized peaks with an energy gap developing in - between .",
    "the peak splitting increases with interaction strength and the spin - polarization is large but not complete .",
    "the resulting magnetization is strongly localized around the impurity .",
    "we find that the magnetization is essentially zero beyond the fourth in - plane neighbors and a surface effect , dying out within six atomic layers ( one lateral unit cell ) .",
    "the magnetization is antiferromagnetically aligned between ( 111 ) planes but ferromagnetic in each plane , apart form the surface plane where it oscillates with the distance to the impurity .    the critical interaction strength @xmath35 for finite magnetization depends on both impurity strength and concentration , as we will discuss below , but is always significantly reduced from the clean limit for strong impurities , e.g.  in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](b ) @xmath36 compared to @xmath32 without impurities",
    ". however , a ti can in general not be modeled on a pure bipartite lattice and thus lieb s theorem @xcite , which states that a site imbalance between the two sublattices gives a finite magnetic moment for any finite hubbard @xmath22 , does not apply . thus vacancies can still require a finite @xmath35 to reach a magnetic state in a ti .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to idealized graphene , which also have a dirac dispersion , where a vacancy always generates a finite magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "the bipartite limit is reached in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) by setting @xmath37 and we then find @xmath38 for a vacancy , but this is not a topological state .",
    "in order to determine when a finite magnetization is induced by nonmagnetic surface impurities , we plot @xmath35 as function of impurity strength for a fixed impurity concentration in fig .",
    "[ fig : uc](a ) .",
    "even though lieb s theorem does not guarantee @xmath39 for vacancies , we still find that a particular large and finite impurity strength gives essentially @xmath39 , and thus finite magnetization even for infinitesimally weakly interacting tis .",
    "this result can be explained by studying the impurity resonance peak positions in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](a ) .",
    "strong impurities push the resonance peak towards the fermi level and thus @xmath35 goes down sharply as the resonance state starts to generate a large dos around the fermi level .",
    "however , a finite concentration of strong impurities also induces a finite residual doping in the system .",
    "this leads to the impurity resonance eventually moving past the fermi level , which reduces the dos at the fermi level , and thus @xmath35 increases again when approaching the unitary scattering limit . with decreasing impurity concentration the residual doping decreases and the dip in @xmath35 is found at ever higher impurity strengths , such that in the limit of an isolated vacancy @xmath40",
    ". to corroborate this picture we also plot the energy of the central dip in the double - peak resonance structure ( blue ) .",
    "clearly , having the resonance peak exactly positioned at the fermi level , i.e.  the dip at @xmath41 , is extremely well correlated with a vanishing @xmath35 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : uc](b ) we investigate more closely the concentration dependence of @xmath35 for vacancies .",
    "decreasing concentration leads to both narrower resonance peaks and smaller residual doping .",
    "this results in a higher dos at the fermi level for vacancies ( cyan ) and we see how this transfers into @xmath35 steadily decreasing with the supercell size @xmath18 .",
    "this inverse correlation between dos at the fermi level and @xmath35 is a very characteristic feature of stoner magnetism .",
    "the stoner criterion for a bulk ferromagnetic state reads @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the bulk dos at the fermi level @xmath44 for one spin species in the paramagnetic state .",
    "however , in non - homogenous systems with impurities , impurity - induced stoner magnetism has been shown to not be sensitive to the precise dos at @xmath44 , but to the whole impurity band if it is narrow enough @xcite .",
    "we clearly see such an effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : uc](a ) , where @xmath35 is primarily determined by the center of the resonance peak , i.e.  the dip between the two peaks .",
    "we find an approximately constant relation between @xmath35 and @xmath45 for a range of different impurity concentrations , but the critical interaction strength is noticeably reduced compared to the bulk stoner criterion .",
    "impurity - induced stoner magnetism has been proposed to generate magnetism for interaction strengths significantly below the bulk stoner criterion in a number of systems , ranging from hydrogenated graphene @xcite and c@xmath46h@xmath47 @xcite to cab@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "for example , charge transfer between narrow impurity bands and the bulk has been shown to enhance the propensity for impurity - driven magnetism @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the spontaneous magnetization in tis with nonmagnetic impurities can be understood as a stoner - like instability , with the overall dos of the resonance peak close to the fermi level determining the critical interaction strength .",
    "the finite magnetization appearing around potential impurities as soon as @xmath34 leads to broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "thus the topological protection of the ti surface state is lost and a mass term , giving rise to an energy gap , is allowed in the ti surface hamiltonian .",
    "intrinsically magnetic impurities placed on a ti surface have been shown to induce a local energy gap @xcite , and it is reasonable to expect a finite energy gap also for potential impurities when @xmath34 .    the energy gap @xmath49 could , in principle , depend on the supercell size @xmath18 , the interaction strength @xmath22 , and the impurity strength @xmath20 .",
    "above we have shown that @xmath20 determines the dos at the fermi level which in turn sets @xmath35 through an impurity - induced stoner mechanism , so we can replace the dependence on @xmath20 with @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg](a ) we then plot the energy gap @xmath49 ( cyan ) as function of @xmath22 for fixed @xmath18 but two different impurities .",
    "we also plot the maximum magnetization @xmath50 ( black ) , which we find to be only a function of @xmath51 .    for both a vacancy , where @xmath36 , and for a @xmath52 impurity , where @xmath40",
    ", the energy gap tracks the maximum magnetization extremely well over the whole range of interaction strengths .",
    "the maximum magnetization value is found on the nearest neighbor sites to the impurity ( second surface layer ) , but instead using the average magnetization gives a similarly strong linear dependence between energy gap and magnetization .",
    "we thus conclude that the energy gap only depends on the supercell size @xmath18 and the magnetization , such that @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being a function of the impurity concentration . for finite impurity concentrations",
    "we find that the energy gap is a global property of the system , i.e.  it does not vary with distance from the impurity .",
    "we thus expect the energy gap to decrease when the impurity concentration is decreasing , since the same maximum magnetization will then be responsible for producing an energy gap in a larger area .",
    "this is verified in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg](b ) , where @xmath55 , or equivalently the maximum magnetization , is kept fixed while the concentration is varied",
    ". thus @xmath56 decreases for increasing @xmath18 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eg](b ) we show more details on how the resonance peak structure evolves with impurity concentration for a non - interacting system ( dashed ) and for a fixed @xmath57 ( solid ) .",
    "the energy gap ( cyan ) develops around the initial dip ( blue ) in the double - peak resonance . in order to accommodate the finite energy gap the two resonance peaks ( black )",
    "are pushed out to larger energies . with decreasing impurity concentration the peak - peak distance",
    "is decreased along with the overall energy gap .",
    "we can now also draw qualitative conclusions in the limit of isolated impurities .",
    "the overall residual doping is then diminished and thus only vacancies produce impurity - induced resonance peaks close to zero energy .",
    "such resonance peaks are very sharp so @xmath35 approaches zero for isolated vacancies .",
    "thus even extremely weakly interacting tis will have a finite magnetization around isolated vacancies .",
    "however , even though @xmath50 only depends on @xmath55 and can therefore be large even for very weakly interacting tis , the size of the induced energy gap will be severely limited by the small function @xmath56 .",
    "we thus do not expect any sizable energy gap in the limit of isolated vacancies .",
    "to complement the above supercell calculations using a hubbard-@xmath22 interaction , we also study the effect of long - range coulomb interactions in a continuum model while treating the impurities within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "the kinetic part is here described by a 2d gapless dirac term , whereas the electron - electron interaction strength is characterized by the dimensionless coupling @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the charge of the electron and @xmath60 the dielectric constant of the system .",
    "we further here assume that the impurities are randomly distributed over the lattice sites , with the on - site potential taking values @xmath20 and 0 with probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , which allows for a binary alloy analogy with the impurity concentration directly linked to @xmath61 .",
    "for a strongly scattering medium with low impurity concentration the effect of the impurities can be incorporated in a self - consistent manner using cpa , which is based on a single - site approximation in a multiple scattering description .",
    "it takes into account terms linear in @xmath61 but disregards scattering off impurity clusters . using the self - energy @xmath63 , which is assumed to be translationally invariant after configurational averaging , as well as spin - independent and site - diagonal , the single particle green s function of the disordered ( but non - interacting ) system can be written as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the bare dispersion relation and @xmath63 is determined self - consistently . for small concentrations of vacancies ( @xmath66 with a cut - off @xmath67 for integral regularization )",
    "we obtain a finite concentration of charge carriers in the vicinity of @xmath68 . calculating the change in energy relative to the paramagnetic state we find ferromagnetism",
    "when @xmath69 , to be compared to @xmath70 in the absence of disorder .",
    "thus , also a continuum model with long - range coulomb interactions facilitates a finite magnetization for noticeable weaker electron - electron interactions in the presence of impurities treated within the cpa .",
    "note that this is in spite of the cpa averaging over impurity configurations , thus not explicitly relying on localized impurity - induced resonance states .",
    "in summary we have shown that strong nonmagnetic impurities on the surface of a ti can induce a finite magnetization and energy gap in the presence of even weak electron - electron interactions .",
    "strong impurities and also vacancies give rise to localized resonance peaks around the dirac point .",
    "the resulting increased low - energy dos leads to a strongly reduced critical interaction strength to reach a magnetic surface state .",
    "thus even very weakly interacting tis will have a finite magnetization emerging around strong nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "the finite magnetization gives rise to a global energy gap which is linearly dependent on the maximum value of the magnetization , but decreases with reduced impurity concentration .                                                                              in this supplementary material",
    "we give the main steps in the continuum calculation for long - range coulomb interactions using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to treat nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian of a continuum model including both a finite impurity concentration ( disorder ) and coulomb repulsion : @xmath71 the first term in the hamiltonian gives the linear gapless dispersion relation inherent to dirac materials with the pauli matrix @xmath72 operating in spin - space for tis ( in agreement with the main text we put @xmath73 ) .",
    "the second term is the electron - electron interaction @xmath74 .",
    "the last term describes the effect of impurities , where we only consider short - range diagonal disorder with @xmath75 .    the on - site green s function for the unperturbed dirac hamiltonian ( first term in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) ) is @xmath76 where we have used the cut - off parameter @xmath77 , which can be determined from @xmath78 for a round - shaped brillouin zone with the lattice spacing @xmath79 . in most cases we are only interested in the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) at @xmath80 : @xmath81 in terms of the impurities , we here presume that the impurities are randomly distributed over the lattice sites , with the on - site potential taking values @xmath20 and 0 with probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "we also assume an impurity concentration @xmath82 , so the results of the calculations can be presented in a power series of @xmath61 . for a strongly scattering medium but where the concentration of impurities is low enough we can work within the cpa , which is a single - site approach .",
    "the advantage of the cpa is that it includes multiple scattering off the same impurity but that scattering off impurity clusters is totally disregarded . in this approach",
    "the bare green s function ( [ asympgreen ] ) is to be replaced by a renormalized green s function and averaged over impurity configurations .",
    "the latter is achieved by defining the self - energy @xmath63 , which has restored translational invariance after configurational averaging @xcite . in the problem under consideration",
    "the self energy @xmath63 is also site - diagonal and identical for both spins . as a result ,",
    "the modified propagator averaged over impurities is @xmath83 and the cpa green s function can thus be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the bare dispersion for the upper and lower dirac bands . in the cpa",
    "the on - site potential takes the values @xmath20 and @xmath86 depending on whether an impurity is present or not at a lattice site , set by the probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "self - consistency is achieved by satisfying @xmath87 for the impurity @xmath88-matrix , which gives @xcite @xmath89 where the last identity holds for vacancies .",
    "as long as the cpa is valid we can evaluate the occupation fraction @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a proper regularization and @xmath92 .",
    "the ground state energy of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) can then be calculated ( similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite ) arriving at @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the angle of @xmath95 relative to the @xmath96-axis . from this expression",
    "we can calculate the difference in energy between an unpolarized ground state with total occupation @xmath97 and that of a state with @xmath98 up - spins and @xmath99 down - spins .",
    "when this energy difference is negative the system spontaneously spin - polarizes .",
