    "nuclei with spin @xmath92 and quadrupolar moment @xmath93 exposed to static electric - field gradients , where the largest component is denoted as @xmath94 , contribute to the specific heat ( per mol of the considered nuclei)@xcite : @xmath95 , with @xmath96 @xmath97 is the universal gas constant , @xmath98 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath99 is the electron charge .",

    "+ second we consider nuclear zeeman levels . assume a fraction @xmath106 of magnetic v moments , which are at / near freezing .",
    "the direct contribution from these moments was already discarded previously .",
    "however , an indirect contribution via the hyperfine field coupling to the nuclei should also be taken into account .",
    "the nuclei are influenced by the on - site moment via the core polarization .",
    "this would result in a local field of the order of 100 t ( per @xmath107 of onsite v moment)@xcite .",
    "the magnetic nuclear contribution to c@xmath108 is @xmath109 , with @xmath110 this takes into account that there are 3 v ions per formula unit and assumes that only a fraction @xmath106 of v ions are magnetic .",

    "we conclude that a tiny amount of `` frozen '' v moments acting on their nuclei via the hyperfine field would explain the observed c@xmath115 at low temperatures .",
    "+      the dynamics of the v moments on a long - time scale at temperatures below @xmath82 was probed by measuring the decay of the remanent magnetization @xmath27 .",
    "we recall that in these experiments the sample is cooled to a given temperature t@xmath13t@xmath116 in a fixed external magnetic field h = 100 oe . after a waiting time of about 10h , h is turned to zero at t=0 and the time evolution of the magnetization @xmath117 is monitored , keeping t fixed . the decay of @xmath118 does not follow a simple functional form and is extremely slow ( fig .",

    "a spin - reorientation of these clusters must occur , and barriers , which depend on the cluster volume v , must be overcome to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "this yields a hierarchy of relaxation times and results in the enhanced power - law for the decay of the magnetization .",
    "+ the above form of the decay does not depend on the mechanism that drives the relaxation , which may be either quantum tunneling ( qt ) or thermal activation ( ta ) .",
    "in addition the three parameters describing relaxation @xmath127 do not independently vary with temperature .",
    "for instance , the attempt frequency @xmath22 may be assumed @xmath128independent . in case of quantum tunneling the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 are also @xmath128independent , resulting in a temperature independent relaxation .",

    "we have performed _ ab initio _ dft calculations for the new crystal structure determined in this work ( see table ii ) and applied the nmto - based downfolding method in order to obtain the effective vanadium - vanadium hopping matrix elements .",
    "we considered a crystal structure with 100@xmath135 occupation of the na positions .",
    "the analysis of the na density of states ( dos ) contribution near the fermi level shows that the effect of na is almost negligible concerning the v hybridizations , and therefore significant changes of the electronic structure are not to be expected by reducing the na content in the calculations .",
    "variations in the hopping integral determination between the crystal structure proposed by millet _ et al._@xcite and the present one are only observed in ( i ) the 1@xmath35 and 2@xmath34 intra - ring hopping parameters which are now almost identical , enforcing the frustration effects in this system , and ( ii ) the inter - ring hopping parameters are slightly larger than those obtained previously , but remain still weaker than the intra - ring hopping parameters .",
    "the analysis of the orbital orientation in the 2@xmath34 intra - ring and 2@xmath34 inter - ring paths shows that , eventhough distances and angles are similar for both cases , the inter - ring hybridizations are of @xmath136 type explaining the weakness of the hopping integral in contrast to the mixed @xmath137 @xmath138 nature of the intra - ring orbital hybridization .",

    "the ferromagnetic contributions @xmath142 , which can be estimated following the kugel - khomskii model@xcite are , on the contrary , of the same order of magnitude for intra- and inter - ring couplings , so that in conclusion , the intra - ring interactions @xmath146 are dominantly antiferromagnetic , while the inter - ring interactions @xmath147 have important ferromagnetic components as pointed out also in ref .  .",

    "+ in the neutron scattering experiments we observed a weak magnetic signal in the energy window of our experiment from -20 to 9 mev , implying that the majority of magnetic excitations are located above 20 mev .",
    "this is consistent with specific heat data , which indicate that at most 1/9 of the total magnetic entropy is released below 20 k , and with the susceptibility data , which monitor one order of magnitude moment reduction below 100 k. the magnetic scattering does not have a pronounced q - dependence expected for spin clusters and , therefore , does not support the models of dimer formation or presence of isolated nine - member rings .",
    "the data might be explained , however , by the existence of clusters with different size and couplings or / and significant inter - cluster couplings smearing out oscillations in @xmath148 .",
    "we note , however , that these scenarios leave unexplained the prominent peak in the temperature dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate around 100 k@xcite .",
    "that peak was used as part of the evidence that spin dimerization may occur in that temperature range .",
    "but our present findings show that it is improbable .",

    "we speculate that segmentation happens due to the defects occurring because of the deviations from ideal stoichiometry .",
    "+ though the dominant feature of susceptibility , the upturn at 100 k , can be well reproduced by an isolated nine - member ring with @xmath29= -160 k and @xmath30= -90 k ( fig .  [ chiso ] ) , other experimental observations on @xmath5 , i.e. neutron magnetic scattering , object a picture of isolated nine - member rings and require the presence of inter - ring couplings or more complex spin objects .",
    "the susceptibility is dominated by strong intra - cluster couplings and is not a sensitive measure of the weaker inter - cluster couplings .",
    "a similar situation happens in coupled systems of triangles@xcite and tetrahedra@xcite .",
    "+ _ ab initio _ calculations point to larger intra - ring than inter - ring hopping integrals .",
