    "vandermonde matrices are well known .",
    "they have a number of interesting properties and play a role in ( lagrange ) interpolation problems , partial fraction expansions , and finding solutions to linear ordinary differential equations , to mention just a few applications .",
    "usually , one takes these matrices square , @xmath0 say , in which case the @xmath1-th column is given by @xmath2 , where we write @xmath3 . if all the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are different , the vandermonde matrix is non - singular , otherwise not .",
    "the latter case obviously takes place when all @xmath4 are the same , @xmath6 say , in which case one could speak of a confluent vandermonde matrix .",
    "non - singularity is obtained if one considers the matrix @xmath7 whose @xmath1-th column ( @xmath5 ) is given by the @xmath8-th derivative @xmath9 , or by @xmath18 . in the latter case , one has @xmath19 .",
    "a slightly more general situation is obtained , when one considers the in general non - square @xmath20 matrix @xmath7 , with @xmath1-th column @xmath9 , @xmath21 . in this case one",
    "has that @xmath7 has rank equal to @xmath22 and for @xmath23 , the kernel of @xmath7 is the @xmath24-dimensional subspace of @xmath25 consisting of the vectors whose first @xmath26 elements are equal to zero .",
    "note that the building elements of the matrix @xmath27 are the column vectors @xmath28 and a number of its derivatives .",
    "the observations above can be generalized in many directions . in the present paper we opt for one of them , in which we will consider generalizations of the confluent vandermonde matrix @xmath7 by considering matrices obtained by using as building blocks the matrices @xmath29 , with @xmath11 as above and @xmath12 , together with its derivatives @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "a special case of what follows is obtained by considering the matrix @xmath34 in a recent paper  @xcite , the kernel of the matrix @xmath35 ( or rather , a matrix obtained by a permutation of the columns of @xmath35 ) has been studied for the case @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "more precisely , the two aims of the cited paper were to find a right inverse and a parametrization of the kernel of the matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the two cases @xmath38 or @xmath39 have been analyzed in detail .",
    "for these two cases two algorithms have been proposed to construct the kernel and the rank and the dimension of the kernel have been computed .",
    "this was of relevance for the characterization of a matrix polynomial equation having non - unique solutions .",
    "the origin of this problem was of a statistical nature and lied in properties of the asymptotic fisher information matrix for estimating the parameters of an armax process and a related stein equation .",
    "the results on the parametrization of the kernel obtained in  @xcite turned out to be unnecessary complicated , partly due an apparently irrelevant distinction between different cases , and not transparent . in the present paper",
    "we reconsider the problem by embedding it into a much more general approach to obtaining properties of matrix polynomials that can be viewed as generalizations of a confluent vandermonde matrix ( in a single variable ) as indicated above .",
    "the solution , which is shown to exhibit a very simple and elegant structure , to the original problem of describing the kernel under consideration , now follows as a byproduct of the current analysis . these are special cases of the unified situations of corollary  [ cor : rankaz ] and proposition  [ prop : kerkz ] of the present paper . in this way we generalize in the present paper the results of  @xcite .",
    "another approach to find a basis for the kernel has been followed in  @xcite , which is also subsumed by proposition  [ prop : kerkz ] .",
    "the results of @xcite are closer in spirit to those of the present paper than the results in  @xcite .",
    "both cited papers contain some examples of right inverses of @xmath35 , that are special cases of what will be obtained in the present paper .",
    "moreover , we will generalize the results for @xmath35 to results for the matrix @xmath40 that is defined by @xmath41 whose blocks we denote @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , so @xmath45 .",
    "we will also consider the related matrix @xmath46 whose blocks are @xmath47 .",
    "a special case occurs for the choices of the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath48 and @xmath38",
    ". then we write @xmath49 and @xmath50 , ordinary ( normalized ) @xmath0 confluent vandermonde matrices .",
    "the results in the next sections ( almost ) reduce to trivialities for ordinary confluent vandermonde matrices , so the contribution of the present paper originates with allowing the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath26 and @xmath53 to be arbitrary .",
    "classical vandermonde matrices and confluent vandermonde matrices have often been studied in the literature , see @xcite for definitions .",
    "more recent papers often focussed on finding formulas for their inverses and on efficient numerical procedures to compute them , a somewhat random choice of references are the papers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it seems that the generalization @xmath40 of the confluent vandermonde matrix is , to the best of our knowledge , unknown in the literature .",
    "derivatives of a function @xmath54 ( often matrix valued ) are denoted by @xmath55 or by @xmath56 .",
    "the variable @xmath6 is in principle @xmath57-valued .",
    "if @xmath58 is an @xmath59 matrix , for notational convenience we adopt the convention to label its elements @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we will see shortly why this a convenient convention .",
    "entries of a matrix are also indicated both by superindices , according to what is typographically most appropriate .",
    "when dealing with matrix polynomials @xmath63 , in proving results we usually suppress the dependence on @xmath6 and simply write @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath64 is a block matrix , we sometimes use subindexes to indicate its constituting blocks , but more often denote its blocks by superindices , so we write @xmath65 or @xmath66 in the latter case . also single superindices are used and we will come across notations like @xmath67 .",
    "these should not be confused with powers of @xmath58 .",
    "the meaning of @xmath67 will always be clear from the context .    throughout the paper @xmath68 and @xmath52",
    "are fixed positive integers , although often certain relations among them are supposed ( e.g.  @xmath69 ) .",
    "given the integers @xmath68 and @xmath52 and the variable @xmath6 , we consider a number of matrix polynomials .",
    "the first are @xmath70 and @xmath71 . with the above labelling convention , valid throughout the paper , we have for the elements of @xmath11 the expression @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "next to these we consider the matrix polynomials @xmath74 we also consider the @xmath75 matrix polynomial @xmath76 which is defined by its @xmath14-blocks @xmath77 for @xmath78 , @xmath44 .",
    "the size of @xmath40 is equal to @xmath79 .",

    "these lead to establishing the rank of @xmath40 , which is shown to be independent of @xmath6 .",
    "a major issue in the present paper is to find a simple and transparent parametrization of the kernels of the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is done first in section  [ section : kerneln0 ] for the special case of @xmath84 .",

    "the results of section  [ section : intermezzo ] form the cornerstone of finding right inverses of @xmath40 , especially those that are not dependent on @xmath6 , which is a main topic of the final section  [ section : rightinverse ] .",
    "this section is devoted to the matrix @xmath112 , to be defined below , that is instrumental in deriving properties of @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "in particular it is used for obtaining useful factorizations in section  [ section : factorization ] .",
    "the matrix @xmath112 , also of block hankel type and of size @xmath83 is defined by its blocks @xmath113 ( here @xmath114 is used as a super index ) of size @xmath115 , for @xmath116 , @xmath44 .",

    "in the present section we obtain a factorization of the matrix polynomial @xmath40 , from which a factorization of the matrix @xmath46 follows as a simple corollary . in the next proposition",

    "equation  ( [ eq : lde ] ) has as the general solution @xmath660 where the exponentials can be computed as finite sums , since @xmath661 and @xmath132 are nilpotent .",
    "elementary computations yield for instance that the @xmath14-element of @xmath662 is given by @xmath663 for @xmath152 and zero otherwise .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath664 , which is in agreement with the definition of @xmath665 .",
    "an example of a solution that is not constant is obtained for @xmath33 and @xmath643 . for the case @xmath429 one",
    "finds directly from the definition of @xmath665 that @xmath666 and @xmath667 in view of remark  [ remark : bjnot ] .",
    "this is in agreement with equation  ( [ eq : hgh ] ) , whose right hand side is equal to @xmath668",
    "we return to one of our original aims , finding a right inverse of the @xmath670 matrix @xmath671 .",
    "recall from theorem  [ thm : ao1 ] and proposition  [ prop : factorm ] that @xmath35 has rank equal to @xmath279 .",
    "hence the matrix is of full rank iff @xmath181 .",
    "equations like @xmath672 will in general not have a solution @xmath673 for a given @xmath674 , if @xmath675 .",
    "in fact , we are interested in solutions @xmath673 that are independent of @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to see that such solutions only exist if @xmath676 and then @xmath677 . the uninteresting case @xmath204 will therefore be ignored and the standing assumption in the remainder of this section is @xmath181 . under this assumption , there are two subcases to discern , @xmath678 and @xmath679 .    [ prop : mki ] assume that @xmath678 and @xmath181 .",
    "let @xmath207 be the @xmath26-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "there exists a constant ( not depending on @xmath6 ) matrix @xmath680 such that @xmath681 for all @xmath6 .",
    "the equation @xmath672 for @xmath682 then has the constant solution @xmath683 .",
    "the constant matrix @xmath684 is unique iff @xmath38 . in all cases",
    "one can take @xmath685 , with @xmath606 as in ( [ eq : b ] ) .    in this proof",
    "we simply write @xmath546 for @xmath207 .",
    "suppose that we have found a constant matrix @xmath684 with the desired property @xmath686 by differentiation of ( [ eq : mk0 ] ) @xmath110 times , with @xmath687 , we obtain , recall the definition of @xmath76 with @xmath184 , that @xmath688 we note that now @xmath40 is of size @xmath689 and has rank equal to @xmath690 . hence @xmath40 has a right inverse , @xmath691 say , and a true inverse in the case that @xmath38 , see e.g.  corollary  [ cor : dets ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath684 should be the first block - column of @xmath692 .",
    "next we use the factorization ( [ eq : m ] ) and note that also @xmath64 has a right inverse , @xmath693 say .",
    "then @xmath694 hence , we can choose @xmath695 which means that @xmath684 is the first block - column of @xmath691 , so @xmath696 where @xmath697 is a right inverse of the matrix @xmath698 , since @xmath698 is the first block - row of @xmath64 .",
    "but , a right inverse of @xmath698 is in proposition  [ lemma : a0b ] shown to be @xmath606 .",
    "therefore , we can now explicitly pose our candidate for @xmath684 , @xmath699 where @xmath606 as defined in  ( [ eq : b ] ) .",

    ", we write @xmath701 decomposing @xmath684 as @xmath702 where each block @xmath703 ( @xmath704 ) is of size @xmath600 , we get @xmath705 hence we see that @xmath706 , which was in proposition  [ prop : gconstant ] shown to be constant and equal to @xmath707 , if we have @xmath650 or @xmath277 .",
    "obviously , this is true of @xmath708 , but for @xmath709 , we have @xmath710 by assumption .",
    "this proves claim ( 1 ) .",
    "since @xmath684 is constant in @xmath6 , we can take @xmath146 in ( [ eq : kz ] ) .",
    "for the second one we have @xmath711 in view of lemma  [ lemma : a0b ] . finally , if @xmath38 , then @xmath40 is invertible , which implies that @xmath684 is the unique constant matrix solving @xmath669 , since in this case equation  ( [ eq : mk ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "the special choice @xmath712 in the proof of proposition  [ prop : mki ] is rather crucial in finding a right inverse of @xmath35 that does nt depend on @xmath6 .",
    "we illustrate this with the following example .",
    "our point of departure is equation  ( [ eq : c ] ) with @xmath48 .    recalling ( [ eq : aa0 ] ) , we can take @xmath713 , with @xmath714 any right inverse of @xmath147 .",
    "we choose @xmath715 and compute @xmath716 because @xmath717 . since @xmath718 ( theorem  [ thm : ao1 ] ) and @xmath719 , for the @xmath110-th block @xmath720 of @xmath721 we get @xmath722 ( @xmath723 . we conclude that @xmath724 .    in order to see that this may result in a right inverse of @xmath35 that depends on @xmath6 , we choose @xmath725 .",
    "the conditions of proposition  [ prop : mki ] are then satisfied .",
    "we have @xmath726 and it follows from the above that @xmath727 we close this remark by noting that there also other right inverses of @xmath35 , depending on @xmath6 , but still having a simple structure .",
    "an example ( essentially taken from  @xcite , where it was only given for @xmath728 in a slightly different situation ) is @xmath729 where @xmath730 is the first basis vector of @xmath170 .",
    "this follows from the easy to verify identity @xmath731    the assertion of proposition  [ prop : mki ] is not true if @xmath679 ( the second subcase ) .",
    "indeed , in the proof of this proposition we used the fact that all @xmath703 are indeed constant matrices , under the condition @xmath678 .",
    "if this is not the case , @xmath679 , the matrices @xmath703 for @xmath732 are not constant , in view of proposition  [ prop : gconstant ] .",
    "let us give an example to illustrate this .",
    "consider the case @xmath733 and @xmath33 . then @xmath734 and the equation @xmath735 has the _ unique _ on @xmath6 depending solution @xmath736 .",
    "+ we now treat the case @xmath737 in more detail . to that end",
    "we need the following auxiliary result .",
    "[ lemma : kerm0 m ] the subspace of the kernel of @xmath35 that consists of vectors that are constant in @xmath6 , i.e.  the intersection @xmath738 , is @xmath739-dimensional .",
    "this subspace is equal to the kernel of @xmath40 with @xmath184 , which is the same for all @xmath6 and hence can be parametrized free of @xmath6 .",
    "the first observation is that a vector @xmath218 in @xmath740 that does nt depend on @xmath6 also satisfies @xmath741 for arbitrary @xmath51 , in particular for @xmath184 .",
    "the case @xmath37 follows from theorem  [ thm : kernel1 ] , since in this case the kernel of @xmath40 is the null space for all @xmath405 .",
    "let then @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath218 be a column vector consisting of @xmath53-dimensional sub - vectors @xmath742 that do nt depend on @xmath6 .",
    "recalling that @xmath743 consists of a row of blocks @xmath744 , we have @xmath745 the vectors @xmath746 are zero for @xmath277 and otherwise linear independent .",
    "hence , to have the above sum equal to zero is equivalent to @xmath747 the equation for arbitrary @xmath748 can be differentiated to get @xmath749 which , subtracting from the equation for @xmath750 yields @xmath751 valid for @xmath752 . the only constant solutions to these equations are the zero vectors , so @xmath753 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath754 we keep the equation @xmath755 now we relabel the unknowns by setting @xmath756 to get @xmath757 we differentiate this equation @xmath301 times , with @xmath406 to get @xmath758 where @xmath222 is obtained by stacking the @xmath759 . the first block - column in the above matrix",
    "is @xmath760 , the second can be written as @xmath761 , up to the last one equal to @xmath762 .",
    "hence the above system of equations can be compactly written as @xmath763 let @xmath764 be the diagonal matrix with elements @xmath765 .",
    "a simple computation shows that @xmath766 , and therefore @xmath767 .",
    "writing @xmath768 , we can rewrite the last equation in @xmath222 as @xmath769 since @xmath770 is invertible for any @xmath6 , this reduces to @xmath771 since the coefficient matrix has full row rank equal to @xmath53 , its kernel has dimension @xmath772 .",
    "actually , this kernel is spanned by the columns of the @xmath773 matrix @xmath774 this proves the claim .",
    "the result of lemma  [ lemma : kerm0 m ] is also valid for @xmath775 .",
    "this can be seen from equation  ( [ eq : wy ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath775 one has to extend the coefficient matrix with additional rows , all involving derivatives @xmath776 , with @xmath327 .",
    "but these are all equal to zero .",
    "one might think that the assertion of the lemma can alternatively be proven by explicitly computing the matrix @xmath560 for @xmath184 ( noting that @xmath777 represents the kernel of @xmath40 in view of ( [ eq : mdnd ] ) ) and showing that it is not depending on @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that this idea is false , as shown by the following simple example .",
    "let @xmath778 , @xmath779 .",
    "we compute @xmath560 and show that it is not free of @xmath6 . according to the results of section  [ section:2ndcase ] we find for @xmath780 , @xmath781 and @xmath782 the following .",

    "the reparametrization of @xmath789 given by @xmath790 with @xmath791 yields @xmath792 , with @xmath793 which is free of @xmath6 .",
    "the procedure in the proof of lemma  [ lemma : kerm0 m ] ( in this case @xmath794 , since @xmath778 ) yields a kernel of @xmath40 spanned by column vectors that are not depending on @xmath6 .",
    "the result of that procedure is the matrix @xmath795 above .      according to proposition  [ prop : mki ] a constant solution @xmath684 exists .",
    "any other constant right inverse @xmath799 is such that the @xmath26 columns of @xmath800 belongs to the kernel of @xmath743 and hence to the kernel of @xmath801 for @xmath184 . in view of lemma  [ lemma : kerm0 m ] ,",
    "a basis of this kernel can be obtained can be obtained by choosing @xmath593 linearly independent vectors . applying this result to each the columns of @xmath800",
    ", we obtain the result .    to illustrate the fact that the constant solution @xmath684 of proposition  [ prop : mki2 ] is in general not unique , we consider the case @xmath778 , @xmath802 .",

    "however , this is impossible for a @xmath821 that is constant in @xmath6 , since differentiating @xmath822 yields @xmath824 .",
    "we conclude that the equation @xmath812 for @xmath825 has no constant solutions .",
    "nonconstant solutions are for instance moore - penrose inverses .",
