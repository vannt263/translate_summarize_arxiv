    "the strong and rapid x - ray variability observed in many seyfert galaxies on time - scales of a day or less provides strong evidence that the x - rays are emitted close to the central black hole .",
    "early efforts to characterise the x - ray variability , using data from _ exosat _ , showed that it has a scale - invariant , red - noise form on time - scales from a few hundred seconds up to the few - days duration of the observations ( m@xmath3hardy & czerny 1987 , lawrence et al .",
    "later studies of the x - ray variability properties of large samples of radio - quiet agn showed that the variability amplitude scales inversely with luminosity ( green , m@xmath4hardy & lehto 1993 ; lawrence & papadakis 1993 ; nandra et al .",
    "one possible explanation of this result is that the higher luminosity agn contain more massive black holes and the variability time - scales in agn scale with black hole mass .",
    "intriguingly , black hole x - ray binary systems ( bhxrbs ) also show red - noise type variability of a similar amplitude to agn , on time - scales less than seconds .",
    "the similarity in x - ray variability properties of agn and bhxrbs raises the possibility that the processes causing variability in agn and bhxrbs are the same and that any characteristic variability time - scales scale with the central black hole mass .",
    "this possibility can be tested by comparing the detailed x - ray timing properties of bhxrbs and agn .",
    "+ timing studies of bhxrbs are usually carried out in the frequency domain using the power spectrum , which shows the contribution of variations on different time - scales ( corresponding to power - spectral frequencies ) to the total variability of the lightcurve .",
    "the power spectra of bhxrbs are dominated by a broadband noise component ( van der klis 1995 ) . on short time - scales ,",
    "the variability is characterised as scale - invariant ` red noise ' , producing a power - law power spectrum ( power @xmath5 at frequency @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the power - spectral slope ) of slope @xmath9@xmath10 ( van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "in the ` low ' state , characterised by a relatively hard x - ray spectrum ( similar to that of agn ) , the power spectrum flattens towards lower frequencies so that on long time - scales the x - ray lightcurve becomes ` white noise ' , with corresponding slope @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in the classic bhxrb system cyg  x-1 , the power - spectral flattening is well described by a power - law with two breaks , a high - frequency break which varies between 1 and 6  hz , above which the power - spectral slope varies between @xmath12@xmath13 and a low - frequency break which varies between 0.04 and 0.4  hz , above which the power - spectral slope @xmath14 and below which the slope @xmath11 ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "in contrast , the power spectrum of the ` high ' ( soft energy spectrum ) state seen in some bhxrbs ( inluding cyg  x-1 ) does not flatten to zero slope ; instead , the slope @xmath15 below the high - frequency break extends to @xmath16  hz ( e.g. cui et al .",
    "+ in order to test the hypothesis that the x - ray variability of agn is similar to that of bhxrbs over a broad range of time - scales , we must search for low - frequency flattening in the broadband power spectra of agn . by fitting models with power - spectral breaks to the agn power spectra and comparing the estimated break frequencies with what we expect",
    "if they correspond to similar breaks in bhxrb power spectra , we can test the possibility that the power - spectral shape is really the same and scales simply with black hole mass .",
    "if so , we expect break frequencies in agn to be found at frequencies of @xmath17  hz or lower , so that monitoring observations on time - scales of weeks or longer are necessary to detect any flattening in the power spectrum .",
    "+ early attempts to measure broadband power spectra of agn were hampered by the sparseness of long - term archival lightcurves , which had to be constructed from data obtained by several missions ( m@xmath3hardy 1988 ) . nonetheless , some evidence for power - spectral flattening was found , but models for the form of the flattening could not be constrained ( papadakis & m@xmath4hardy 1995 ) .",
    "+ ideally , broadband power spectra should be measured from lightcurves obtained with frequent and regular sampling over a long duration , which previous missions were not optimised to do .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , which has just such a capability , was launched in december 1995 .",
    "_ rxte _ carries a large - area proportional counter array ( the pca ) which can detect many agn with good signal - to - noise in less than 1000  s , but most importantly , _",
    "rxte _ can slew rapidly so that it may monitor many targets with frequent 1  ks snapshots .",
    "+ we have monitored a sample of 4 seyfert galaxies ( mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  4051 , 5506 and 5548 ) with _ rxte _ since 1996 , in order to measure their broadband power spectra .",
    "these objects are known to be significantly x - ray variable and cover a broad range of x - ray luminosity ( ngc  4051@xmath18  erg  s@xmath19 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  5506@xmath20  erg  s@xmath19 , ngc  5548@xmath21  erg  s@xmath19 ) and presumably , a broad range of black hole masses .",
    "we describe the power spectrum of ngc  4051 , which shows unusual non - stationarity in its lightcurve ( uttley et al .",
    "1999 ) in a separate paper ( papadakis , m@xmath4hardy & uttley , in prep . ) . in this paper , we present a power - spectral study of the remaining three objects in our sample using data from _ rxte _ cycles 1 , 2 and 3 , also including the excellent lightcurves obtained as part of a separate power - spectral study of the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  3516 ( luminosity@xmath20  erg  s@xmath19 ) , by edelson & nandra ( 1999 ) .",
    "we describe data reduction and present the lightcurves in section  2 .",
    "+ the estimation of the underlying power - spectral shape from lightcurves which are discretely ( and possibly unevenly ) sampled is hampered by the distorting effects of aliasing and red - noise leak .",
    "a further serious problem is that the measured power spectra are intrinsically noisy , and reliable errors on the power in each frequency bin can not be estimated from the data ( especially at low frequencies ) , due to the small number ( @xmath22 ) of power - spectral measurements made in each frequency bin . in section  3 , after presenting the observed power spectra , we describe these problems , which previous efforts to constrain the shape of the broadband power spectrum of agn using _ rxte _ data ( e.g. edelson & nandra 1999 , nowak & chiang 2000 ) have not accounted for .",
    "+ to overcome the difficulties in estimating the true power - spectral shape , we have developed a method which we call psresp , based on the response method ( done et al .",
    "1992 ) which uses monte carlo simulations of lightcurves to take account of the distorting effects of sampling and to estimate uncertainties , allowing us to test various power - spectral models against the data .",
    "we describe psresp in section  4 , and apply it to the lightcurves of our sample of seyfert galaxies in section  5 , in order to test for flattening in their broadband power spectra and constrain simple models for describing any flattening we see . in section  6",
    ", we compare our results with those obtained by naively fitting the observed power spectrum ( without taking proper account of errors and the distortion due to sampling ) , use our power spectral measurements to estimate the black hole masses of the agn in our sample and discuss some of the implications of our results , before making concluding remarks in section  7 .",
    "we use data obtained with the pca on board _ rxte _ covering a three year period during observing cycles 13 when the pca gain setting was constant , so that count rate measurements provide a simple measure of observed flux . of the three instruments on board _ rxte _ , only the pca is sensitive enough to allow us to make an accurate flux measurement for our targets with the 1  ks snapshots which our monitoring consists of .",
    "the pca consists of 5 xenon - filled proportional counter units ( pcus ) , numbered 0 to 4 which are sensitive in the 260  kev energy range and contribute to a total effective area of 6500  @xmath23 . since launch",
    ", discharge problems have meant that one or both of pcus 3 and 4 are often switched off ( this problem extended to pcu  1 in march 1999 but we do not include this later data here ) . despite the loss of up to two pcus during our observations , we are easily able to obtain sufficient signal - to - noise in a single snapshot for our purposes ( @xmath24 ) . +    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ tab : masses ] shows that , for the objects with the best - constrained characteristic frequencies in their power spectra ( mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  3516 ) , the knee model predicts a lower black hole mass than the high - frequency break model .",
    "reverberation mapping estimates of the mass of ngc  3516 suggest a black hole mass of @xmath25  m@xmath26 ( wanders & horne 1994 ) , compatible with the best estimate of mass from the high - frequency break model , but not inconsistent with the upper limit derived from the knee model . given the uncertainty in the true bolometric luminosity , and the conservative upper mass limits quoted here , the masses predicted by the knee model are consistent with sub - eddington accretion rates .",
    "+ however , the conservative 40% eddington lower limit to accretion rate estimated from the knee model fits to the power spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( where the bolometric luminosity quoted represents a firm lower bound ) is in contrast to that observed in cyg  x-1 where the transition between the low and high states occurs at only a few per cent of the eddington luminosity ( di salvo et al .",
    "2001 , zhang et al .",
    "since the knee model represents the low - frequency break seen in the power spectrum of cyg x-1 in the low state , it would seem that the evidence from accretion rate is inconsistent with the knee model , at least in this source .",
    "interestingly , even the high - frequency break model predicts an upper limit to black hole mass which is only barely consistent with the low - state accretion rates seen in cyg  x-1 .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is in a state analogous to the high state of cyg  x-1 , which has a characteristic steep ( @xmath27 ) high - frequency power spectrum breaking at 10  hz to @xmath15 , with no low - frequency breaks down to frequencies as low as @xmath28  hz ( cui et al . 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , high state power spectra similar in shape to that of cyg  x-1 would also be compatible with the high - frequency break model we use here . scaling by the high state frequency - break yields an estimated black hole mass of @xmath29  m@xmath30 ( upper limit @xmath31",
    "m@xmath30 ) , implying an accretion rate of @xmath32% eddington ( which we might expect from a high - state source ) . +",
    "although the black hole mass in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 has not yet been measured by reverberation mapping , reynolds ( 2000 ) has pointed out that the low luminosity ( absolute b magnitude @xmath33 ) of the s0 host galaxy of this agn corresponds to a black hole mass of @xmath34  m@xmath30 if the black hole mass - bulge luminosity relation is the same as that determined by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a sample of normal elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "we note here that the black hole masses of all the seyfert galaxies which have been reverberation mapped show smaller black hole masses by a factor of @xmath2 than the magorrian relation suggests ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "this discrepancy would imply a black hole mass for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 which is significantly lower than @xmath35  m@xmath30 , consistent with the low mass suggested by the high state interpretation of the power spectrum .",
    "we further note that the lower , reverberation mapping estimates of black hole mass in agn also follow the recently discovered correlation of black hole mass with bulge velocity dispersion , which has been found to be a better predictor of black hole mass than the magorrian relation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese et al .",
    "therefore it seems plausible that the black hole in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 has a mass of order @xmath36  m@xmath30 .",
    "reverberation mapping , or another independent mass estimation technique will be required to confirm this .",
    "+ the power - spectral shape of ngc  5506 is also consistent with a high state interpretation of this source , although the uncertainties on the break frequency are sufficiently large that a low - state interpretation would suffice to fit the data self - consistently .",
    "we note here however that the low luminosity of the ngc  5506 galaxy ( absolute b magnitude @xmath37 ) , suggests that the central black hole mass is relatively low .",
    "although reverberation mapping of ngc  5506 is not possible because it is a seyfert  2 , it does have a water megamaser ( braatz , wilson & henkel 1994 ) which might permit a good estimate of its central black hole mass for comparison with the mass estimated from its power spectrum .",
    "+ the high state agn interpretation for either mcg-6 - 30 - 15 or ngc  5506 is highly speculative at this stage .",
    "one significant problem is that the energy spectra of neither source shows the steep power - law ( @xmath38 ) and strong disk blackbody components seen in the spectrum of cyg  x-1 in the high state ( cui et al .",
    "1998 ) , although this difference might be a result of the significantly lower disk temperature expected in agn compared to bhxrbs .",
    "greater support for the high state interpretation in either mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  5506 could be provided by the detection of significant power down to very low frequencies , implying that there is no low - frequency break in the power spectrum on frequencies @xmath39 .",
    "continued long - term monitoring will help to resolve this issue . + the frequency break in ngc  5548 is not signficantly detected .",
    "the black hole mass of ngc  5548 measured from reverberation mapping is @xmath40  m@xmath30 ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) , implying that the accretion rate is relatively low ( @xmath41 eddington ) , so applying the low state interpretation we can estimate that the high - frequency break occurs at @xmath42  hz , and may become detectable with further monitoring observations .",
    "+      the main result of this work has been to show that the power spectra of agn flatten towards low frequencies . whether this flattening has the same form as that in bhxrbs is still not certain .",
    "the data do not yet allow us to categorically rule out either knee or high - frequency break models , let alone more complex models where the power spectra might have multiple breaks or flatten gradually .",
    "however , it is encouraging that a simple high - frequency break , similar to that seen in the classic bhxrb cyg  x-1 , can fit the data well , and yield plausible black hole masses if we assume that the break frequency scales inversely with black hole mass .",
    "+    0.9    a useful way of comparing power spectra is to plot frequency@xmath43power , rather than power , as a function of frequency .",
    "the @xmath44 plot produced in this way is analogous to the @xmath45 method of displaying energy spectra , in that the peak in the @xmath44 plot shows which time - scales most of the variability occurs on , as well as the magnitude of variability on those time - scales . in figure  [ nfncomp ]",
    "we plot the @xmath44 power spectra for the best - fitting knee and high - frequency break models fitted to the observed power spectra of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  5506 and ngc  3516 ( see section  [ hfbk ] ) .",
    "the @xmath44 power spectra of ngc  5548 are also included in the figure , except that since the knee or break is not defined for this object , we have assumed knee and break frequencies of @xmath46  hz and @xmath47  hz respectively , corresponding to the black hole mass of @xmath48  m@xmath30 estimated from reverberation mapping . for comparison , @xmath44 power spectra of cyg  x-1",
    "are included , corresponding to typical power - spectral parameters in the low and high states ( nowak et al .",
    "1999 , cui et al .",
    "+ note that the flat peaks in the high - frequency break @xmath44 power spectra of agn and the typical power spectra of cyg  x-1 correspond to the @xmath1 part of the power spectrum , where there is equal integrated power per decade of frequency .",
    "the low - frequency drop - off in the @xmath44 power in the low state of cyg  x-1 corresponds to the low - frequency break or ` knee ' in the power spectrum , which we have not yet detected in the agn power spectra if we are seeing the high - frequency break , because our low - frequency data is not yet adequate to detect it .",
    "therefore , until clear evidence for low - frequency flattening to a slope @xmath1 is found , we can not rule out the possibility that all our sources have power spectra similar to the high state power spectrum in cyg  x-1 .",
    "+ note that the knee model @xmath44 power spectra do not show flat peaks , because the high - frequency slopes fitted are all significantly steeper than 1 .",
    "if we were measuring the low - frequency break alone ( i.e. the frequency of the high - frequency break is too high to detect ) , we would expect the knee model to fit high - frequency slopes of @xmath15 .",
    "this result provides additional evidence that we are indeed measuring the high - frequency breaks in these sources , if the power spectra of agn have the same shape as those of bhxrbs .",
    "however , we stress that we can not yet rule out the possibility that we are measuring more complex configurations including both high and low - frequency breaks",
    ". + fig .",
    "[ nfncomp ] shows clearly that the @xmath44 power spectra of agn are similar to those in cyg  x-1 , in that they have similar peak powers , but are shifted at least 5 decades down the frequency axis . the fact that the peak powers are similar implies that the number of varying regions and the general pattern of variability is the same in agn and bhxrbs , while the luminosity of the varying regions and their variability time - scales are scaled by some factor which could be the black hole mass",
    "we have presented long - term _ rxte _ monitoring lightcurves for 4 seyfert galaxies , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  5506 , ngc  5548 and ngc  3516 , and measured their broadband power spectra to determine if they flatten towards low frequencies , like those of bhxrbs .",
    "the interpretation of power spectra measured from discretely ( and sometimes unevenly ) sampled lightcurves is complicated by the distorting effects of red - noise leak and aliasing .",
    "a further serious problem is that reliable errors in the power in each frequency bin can not be defined from the data , due to the small number ( @xmath22 ) of power - spectral measurements in each frequency bin .",
    "+ to overcome these difficulties , we have built on the response method of done et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , to develop a reliable monte carlo method for testing models for the underlying power - spectral shape of discretely , unevenly sampled lightcurves .",
    "our method , psresp , takes proper account of the effects of aliasing and red - noise leak and crucially , uses the distribution of simulated power spectra to define reliable confidence limits on our model fits .",
    "+ we have used psresp to test simple models for the power - spectral shape of the active galaxies in our sample .",
    "our main results are :    1 .   a single power - law model for the power spectra , with no low - frequency flattening ,",
    "is rejected at better than 95% confidence for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  5506 and ngc  3516 .",
    "the power spectrum of ngc  5548 is consistent with a single power - law .",
    "2 .   both the knee model ( flattening to slope @xmath0 ) and high - frequency break model ( flattening to @xmath1 ) provide good fits to the power spectra of all four sources .",
    "knee / break frequencies are well constrained for all sources except ngc  5548 , for which we can define upper limits only .",
    "the characteristic knee / break frequency measured for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is significantly higher ( 99% confidence ) than the corresponding frequency in ngc  3516 , even though both sources have similar x - ray luminosities ( @xmath49  erg  s@xmath19 ) .",
    "4 .   if the knees or breaks correspond to those seen in the low - state power spectrum of cyg  x-1 , and the characteristic knee / break time - scales scale linearly with black hole mass , the black hole masses estimated from the knee model are lower than those estimated by the break model , but remain consistent with sub - eddington accretion rates . in the case of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , the conservative lower limit on accretion rate estimated from the knee model",
    "is an order of magnitude higher than that seen in the low state of cyg  x-1 , favouring the high - frequency break model and further suggesting that the break seen in the power spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( and possibly ngc  5506 ) is analogous to the high - frequency break seen in the _ high state _ power spectrum of cyg  x-1 .",
    "the @xmath44 power spectra of the seyfert galaxies studied here are similar in amplitude to the @xmath44 power spectra of cyg  x-1 in the high and low states .",
    "conclusions 4 & 5 imply that the power spectra of agn are consistent with being identical in shape and fractional rms amplitude ( integrated over the whole power spectrum ) to those of bhxrbs , with characteristic time - scales scaling linearly with black hole mass .",
    "arguments based on accretion rate seem to favour the high - frequency break model over the knee model in at least one source ( mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ) , although this evidence is circumstantial . further monitoring observations ( which are currently underway ) are needed to reject either model on the basis of power - spectral measurements alone , and to confirm the interesting possibility that two of the objects in our sample are analogous to high - state bhxrbs .",
    "we would like to thank the entire _ rxte _ team for making this work possible , and the anonymous referee , for helpful comments and suggestions .",

    "<S> assuming linear scaling of characteristic frequencies with black hole mass , the high accretion rate implied for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 favours the high - frequency break model for this source and further suggests that mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and possibly ngc  5506 , may be analogues of cyg  x-1 in the high state . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of our model fits with naive fits , where the model is fitted directly to the observed power spectra ( with errors estimated from the data ) , shows that monte carlo fitting is essential for reliably constraining the broadband power spectra of agn lightcurves obtained to date .    </S>",
