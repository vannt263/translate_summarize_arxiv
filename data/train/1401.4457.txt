    "measurements of the orbital eccentricity and the projected misalignment between the spin of the host star and the orbit of extrasolar planets ( i.e. , the projected stellar obliquity @xmath3 ) have revealed that planetary architectures commonly differ from that of our own solar system .",
    "the eccentricity distribution is broad , with @xmath4 in @xmath5 of the planets , while the obliquity distribution ( mostly from measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect from giant planets in close - in orbits ) shows that @xmath6 of the planets have @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the existence of massive short - period planets  the so - called hot jupiters",
    " points towards a dynamical history of known extrasolar planets that is quite different from that of the solar system .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed to account for the large eccentricities of giant planets : interaction with the natal protoplanetary disk @xcite , secular perturbations due to distant stellar @xcite or planetary companions @xcite , dynamical instabilities due to planet - planet gravitational interactions @xcite , and others .",
    "the mechanisms described above to excite the eccentricities that involve gravitational interactions with planetary or stellar companions can also potentially account for the observed high stellar obliquities and the presence of close - in planets , through tidal circularization of high - eccentricity , high - inclination orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk lead to migration and can account for the planets in close - in orbits , but are not expected to produce large obliquities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "planet - planet gravitational interactions in multiple - planet systems have been extensively studied through @xmath8-body experiments and have been shown to reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution of planets with periods @xmath9 days reasonably well for a wide range of initial conditions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we test a class of planet - formation models in which planets either migrate first or are formed at small orbital separations ( @xmath10 au ) in low - eccentricity and low - inclination orbits ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , and then acquire their eccentricities and inclinations through planet - planet gravitational interactions .",
    "this situation could arise , for example , by means of disk migration without eccentricity and inclination excitation ( or with eccentricity and inclination excitation which are subsequently damped ) followed by disk dispersal , or through in - situ formation from a close - in disk resulting from a binary merger @xcite .",
    "we recognize that our separation into two phases , `` migration in the presence of gas '' , and ",
    "planet - planet gravitational interactions without gas \" is artificial and the planets might enter the gas - free phase in orbital configurations that differ from our assumed ( nearly circular and coplanar ) initial conditions @xcite . however , unless we make this separation it is hard to isolate the purely dynamical effects that take place after disk dispersal .",
    "two types of instability condition exist for systems containing a star and two or more orbiting planets .",
    "_ hill stability _ requires that the planets preserve the ordering of the distances to the star , i.e. , there are no orbit - crossing events .",
    "_ lagrange stability _ requires both that the planets are hill stable and that the outermost planet remains bound to the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for two - planet systems ,",
    "the former stability criterion has a well - defined boundary for the minimum separations of the planets with small eccentricities @xcite , while the latter is less well - understood @xcite .",
    "note that systems with more than two planets are not provably hill stable for any initial separation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous work by @xcite showed that the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations by gravitational interactions between planets ( `` planet - planet scattering '' ) is largely determined by the branching ratios into different dynamical outcomes such as planetary ejections , collisions with the star or planet - planet collisions .",
    "in particular , these authors show that simulations with two jupiter - like planets placed initially in hill unstable orbits result mostly in planet - planet collisions for the range of semi - major axes @xmath11 au , and that the daughter planets produced in collisions have small eccentricities ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in contrast , planetary ejections leave the surviving planet with significant eccentricity : for two equal - mass - planet simulations @xcite find @xmath13 for the survivor .",
    "similar experiments by @xcite and @xcite show that when the planet masses are unequal the fraction of planet collisions relative to ejections is reduced and the eccentricities of the planets surviving after ejections are lower , resulting in a better match to the observed eccentricity distribution .    the latter experiments also show that the ratio of ejections to planet - planet collisions increases monotonically with @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the semi - major axis",
    ", @xmath17 is radius of the planet , and @xmath18 is the radius of jupiter .",
    "this behavior is related to the ratio @xmath19 of the escape velocity at the surface of the planet to the circular velocity of the planet : ^2 & & ( ) ( ) + & & ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) , [ eq : theta ] for @xmath20 the planetary radius is so small that close encounters mostly lead to ejections relative to collisions , while for @xmath21 collisions will be more frequent .",
    "our definition of @xmath22 differs from the so - called safronov number because it uses the circular velocity of the planet instead of the relative velocity between planets .",
    "extrapolating the results by @xcite or @xcite to smaller orbital separations suggests that planet - planet collisions should happen even more frequently relative to ejections .",
    "however , this conclusion is sensitive to the particular initial conditions of these simulations . in particular , these authors initialize the orbital integrations with :    1 .",
    "small relative orbital separations so the systems are hill unstable , 2 .",
    "nearly circular and coplanar orbital configurations , 3 .   and two planets .    with these initial conditions ,",
    "the planets have small relative velocities ( compared to their circular velocities ) during the first close approaches , so gravitational focusing can significantly enhance the rate of collisions .",
    "additionally , the simulations by @xcite show that two - planet systems in hill stable configurations can still be lagrange unstable over sufficiently long timescales ( at least @xmath23 orbits of the inner planet for two jupiter - mass planets ) .",
    "such systems contribute as an extra source of ejections and collisions with the star , while avoiding planet - planet collisions .",
    "simulations with more than two planets can become hill unstable for larger initial separations between planets than in the two - planet case ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that close encounters for these larger separations happen after the planets have attained significant eccentricities , allowing close encounters to occur typically at higher relative velocities compared to the two - planet simulations , reducing the overproduction of collisions due to gravitational focusing .",
    "these simulations show that the timescale for instability ( time to the first orbit crossing ) grows exponentially with the initial separation in units of the mutual hill radii defined in equation ( [ eq : delta_a ] ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "once the eccentricities have grown , the number of planets gradually shrinks due to collisions between planets , planetary ejections , and collisions with the star , relaxing to a state in which three or fewer planets persist in eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "we extend previous studies by focusing on the dynamical evolution of systems of close - in planets ( 0.05 au@xmath24 au ) .",
    "we survey the parameter space of simulations with two and three planets to address whether planet - planet scattering can produce eccentricities and inclinations that are as large as those of the observed exoplanets .",
    "recall that our goal is to test the scenario in which scattering takes place after the planets have migrated to ( or formed at ) small separations with small eccentricities and inclinations .",

    "we start by studying simulations with two planets ( @xmath39 ) because these have been the subject of extensive previous work and because understanding this simple case facilitates the analysis of simulations with more planets ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , two - planet systems have certain special features that are not found in systems with more than two planets .",
    "in particular , collisions can only happen if the planets initially lie inside the well - defined and narrow hill unstable region ( see discussion in  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we also perform simulations with @xmath40 , which are not subject to the latter restriction because systems can become hill unstable for arbitrarily large initial separations between planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "however , the simulations by @xcite with @xmath41 almost always end up with @xmath42 surviving planets after ejections and collisions of other planets in the system .",

    "therefore , it is plausible that the final state of systems initially with @xmath41 will be similar to that of systems with @xmath40 .",
    "even though tidal dissipation can be important for planets that approach the host star within a few stellar radii , we ignore its effect .",
    "we justify this choice because we are interested in studying the maximum efficiency with which planet - planet scattering can produce high eccentricities and inclinations , and tides will only decrease this efficiency .",

    "this result is expected from the larger initial eccentricities in _ 2pl - k _ , which reduces the merger cross section . from figure",
    "[ fig : inputs ] and table 3 , we see that the eccentricity distribution broadens and the median eccentricity grows from 0.012 in the fiducial simulation to 0.12 .",
    "this behavior is the result of two effects : the higher number of ejections and collisions with the star relative to planet - planet collisions ( systems with @xmath148 in figure [ fig : inputs ] ) and higher eccentricities after collisions ( systems with @xmath121 ) .",
    "the latter effect is expected from the higher initial eccentricities and the larger number of close encounters before collisions ( the average increases from 1.5 in the fiducial simulation to 12 ) , because both effects promote higher eccentricities and , therefore , collisions at higher relative velocities .    despite these differences ,",
    "the main conclusion of this paper still holds : planet - planet scattering can not efficiently excite eccentricities and inclinations at small semi - major axes .",
    "although the mean and median eccentricities of 0.27 and 0.12 of the active systems in _ 2pl - k _ bracket the analogous quantities in the observed exoplanet sample ( 0.19 and 0.17 ) , ( i ) the initial conditions of the simulation already had mean and median eccentricities of 0.125 and 0.117 so only part of the final eccentricity is due to excitation ; ( ii ) realistic ensembles would contain many inactive systems , in which almost no eccentricity excitation occurs ; ( iii ) in systems with @xmath62 and zero initial eccentricity almost all of the systems are inactive .",
    "the mean ( median ) inclination in active systems is only @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) .",

    "the median eccentricity of the active systems rises from 0.098 in the fiducial simulation to 0.44 in _ 3pl - a2 _ while the median eccentricity of all the systems is 0.25 , compared to the observed median eccentricity of 0.23 in this semi - major axis range .",

    "this reduction in the relative number of collisions broadens the eccentricity distribution ( figure [ fig : inputs ] ) : the median eccentricity of the active systems increases from @xmath169 in the fiducial simulation to @xmath170 in _ 3pl - a1_. these higher eccentricities in _ 3pl - a1 _ are , however , still smaller than the measured eccentricities ( table 3 ) .",
    "finally , the mean ( median ) inclination is @xmath171 ( @xmath159 ) , slightly larger than the fiducial three - planet simulation ( table 2 ) .    in conclusion , placing the planets in larger semi - major axis enhances the efficiency to produce ejections and collisions with the star and , therefore , the outcomes of active systems have higher eccentricity and inclination orbits .",
    "our simulation _ 3pl - a2 _ shows that scattering at @xmath161 au produces eccentricities in the active systems that are larger than those measured from the observed exoplanets in this semi - major axis range , so the results could be consistent with the observations if a significant fraction of the observed systems are inactive .",
    "in contrast , the simulations with planets at @xmath172 au ( _ 3pl - fiducial _ and _ 3pl - a1 _ ) predict eccentricities that are smaller than those seen in our exoplanet sample , even if we restrict ourselves to active systems , which is mainly due to the prevalence of planet collisions .",
    "we remark that the evolution of the different branching ratios as a function of @xmath14 has been previously studied by @xcite in simulations with two planets and our results point in the same direction : the number of collisions per ejections decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the ratio of collisions to ejections decreases as the mass ratio @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) shrinks .    to test how sensitive our results are to the mass ratio , we ran 1,000 simulations similar to the fiducial two - planet simulation , changing the mass ratio from @xmath173 to @xmath174 ( simulation _ 2pl - mass _ in table 1 ) .",
    "we initialize the system with two planets with masses @xmath175 and @xmath176 and randomly pick one planet to have the smaller semi - major axis .",
    "we fix the planets radii to that of jupiter ) because it results in the same condition for collisions for this particular value of the mass ratio @xmath28 : distance between planets @xmath177 . ] .    from table 1 , the ratio of the number of systems that have planet collisions to the number of systems with ejections and collisions with the star increases from 6 for the fiducial simulation to 10 for _ 2pl - mass _ , although this change is not significant given the poisson errors in the simulations .",
    "we do not see the reduction in the number of collisions observed in the simulations by @xcite .",
    "this difference might be due to the fact that most of the ejections and collisions with the star happen in systems that are hill stable , which are excluded in the simulations by @xcite .    if a planet is ejected , it is always the lighter one , while the median eccentricity of the planet left is 0.26 .",
    "this median eccentricity falls within the range @xmath178 found by @xcite for the same mass ratio and is lower than that observed in the fiducial two - equal - mass - planet simulation .    from table 3 ,",
    "the mean and median eccentricities of _ 2pl - mass _ are smaller than those of the observed exoplanets , as is the case for the fiducial two - planet simulation .",
    "the mean ( median ) inclinations are @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) .    in summary , the overall effect of having unequal - mass planets is to produce lower eccentricities after ejections ( at least for @xmath174 ) .",
    "changing @xmath28 to more extreme values would not change our main conclusion because , even if the number of collisions per ejection decreases , @xcite showed that the eccentricity of the surviving planet after the ejection would decrease with decreasing @xmath28 ( for reference @xcite find @xmath181 for @xmath182 ) .",
    "likewise , the final inclinations after ejections are also limited as one decreases @xmath28 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations is inefficient even if the mass ratio departs from unity .      in _ 3pl-@xmath34",
    "_ we initialized the orbits with a broader eccentricity and inclination distribution ( @xmath183 in eq .",

    "similar to the simulation _ 2pl - k _ discussed in ",
    "[ sec : k ] , this is expected from the larger initial eccentricities and inclinations in _ 3pl-@xmath34 _ , which reduces the merger cross section . from figure",
    "[ fig : inputs ] and table 3 , we see that the eccentricity distribution in active systems broadens and the median eccentricity grows from 0.098 in the fiducial simulation to 0.16 .",
    "the mean and median eccentricities of 0.21 and 0.16 of the active systems in _ 3pl-@xmath34 _ bracket the analogous quantities in the observed exoplanet sample ( 0.19 and 0.17 ) .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : k ] for _ 2pl - k _ , only part of the final eccentricity is due to excitation because the initial conditions of the simulation already had mean and median eccentricities of 0.125 and 0.117 .",
    "in addition , realistic ensembles would contain many inactive systems , in which almost no eccentricity excitation occurs .",
    "thus , our conclusion that planet- planet scattering can not efficiently excite eccentricities and inclinations at small semi - major axes should still hold .",
    "the distribution of inclinations in _ 3pl-@xmath34 _ also broadens significantly relative to the fiducial simulation and the mean ( median ) inclination in active systems becomes @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the main result from our orbit integrations is simple : at small semi - major axes , gravitational interactions between planets in unstable systems mostly lead to collisions rather than to excitation of highly eccentric and inclined planetary orbits .",
    "collisions are more common than ejections or collisions with the star because the orbital velocities at small separations are typically larger than the escape velocity of giant planets ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : theta ] , for reference ) .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached in the numerical study by @xcite .",
    "moreover , planet - planet collisions from low - eccentricity , low - inclination orbits typically produce collision products that occupy orbits with even lower eccentricity and inclination . the low - inclination orbits are easily understood as a result of angular momentum conservation during the collision of two planets with nearly the same initial orbital planes .    consequently , our simulations with two or three planets initially in low - eccentricity orbits at @xmath77 au ( i.e. , excluding _ 2pl - k _ and _ 3pl-@xmath34 _ ) predict mean ( median ) final eccentricities for the active systems that are @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) times smaller than those observed in the exoplanets in a similar semi - major axis range ( table 3 ) .",
    "moreover , if we include planets from the inactive systems the mean and median eccentricities will be even smaller .",
    "for instance , the mean ( median ) eccentricities for all ( active + inactive ) planets in each simulation is @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) times smaller than the observed values .",
    "the previous result holds even for the simulations with three jupiter - like planets initially at semi - major axes as large as @xmath160 au because the mean ( median ) eccentricities of planets in active systems is 1.5 ( 1.3 ) times smaller than those observed in the data .",
    "this result breaks down when placing the planets at @xmath161 au because these simulations predict mean and median eccentricities in active systems that are larger by a factor of @xmath193 than those observed in the data .",
    "however , this simulation can be made consistent with the data by adding a significant fraction of inactive systems .",
    "the eccentricities in the simulations above are larger that those in the fiducial simulation because of the dramatic decrease in the relative number of planet collisions in active systems as we increase the semi - major axis ( or @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ eq : theta ] ) .    in _ 2pl - k _ and _ 3pl-@xmath34 _ we initialized the orbits with a broad eccentricity distribution ( mean of 0.125 ) that might result from a previous dynamically active phase when the gas disk is present @xcite . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : k ] and  [ sec : sigma ] , these simulations starts close to the dispersion - dominated regime , in contrast to the rest of the simulations which are well in the shear - dominated regime @xcite .",
    "we observe , however , that even in these more extreme conditions planet - planet collisions dominate the branching ratios , limiting the eccentricity excitation . by considering",
    "that realistic ensembles would contain a mixture of active and in actives systems our conclusion that scattering at small semi - major axis is unable to explain the observations can still hold .",
    "our simulations suggest that in order to have final eccentricities that are as high as in the observations the initial eccentricities had to be previously excited to @xmath194 . in principle",
    ", eccentricity excitation could be produced by effects that we have ignored in our simulations .",
    "for instance , a combination of tides with the host star , secular precession effects , and secular interactions with a relatively distant companion can lead to eccentricity excitation of a close - in planet @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism requires a companion in particular orbital configurations and specific values of tidal dissipation that might not be present in the bulk of planetary systems @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that during the assembly of our initial systems , the planets had crossed high - order mean motion resonances ( e.g. , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and so on ) that could lead to eccentricity and inclination excitation @xcite .",
    "this possibility is speculative and would require convergent migration of planets in which case planet - planet scattering is likely to have occurred before the planets reach semi - major axis that are as small as in our simulations .",
    "also , the gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk could potentially excite eccentricities during the assembly of our initial conditions @xcite .",
    "we expect that simulations with more than three planets would present a similar behavior as our three - planet experiments .",
    "our expectation is guided by the experiments of @xcite who find that regardless of the initial conditions and initial number of planets , the systems almost always reach a point in which there are three planets .",
    "there might be two shortcomings with this reasoning .",
    "first , having many planets in active systems can leave the three planets in orbits with significant eccentricities , which reduces the merger cross section .",
    "second , after several merger events the planets can increase their masses and , therefore , their escape velocities .",
    "both effect can reduce the rate of collisions .    tidal dissipation with",
    "the host star should significantly affect the long - term dynamical evolution of close - in planets .",
    "@xcite suggest that indeed some of the observed eccentric close - in planets are in the process of getting tidally circularized .",
    "we have , however , ignored the effect of tides in our calculations .",
    "we expect that the main effect would be to damp the eccentricities and given that we are mostly interested in determining the maximum efficiency of planet - planet scattering at producing high eccentricities , the effect of tides would only make our conclusion stronger .      from our main result , we can draw the following straightforward conclusion : if planet - planet scattering is responsible for the highly eccentric and inclined planetary orbits seen in many exoplanets with small semi - major axes , then the scattering must have occurred at much larger orbital separations .",
    "interestingly , this conclusion links the migration mechanism or assembly process with the excitation of eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "for instance , we can rule out the scenario in which planets undergo disk - driven migration to small radii with no eccentricity and inclination excitation .",
    "we can also rule out the scenario in which planets are assembled in close - in nearly circular and planar orbits , for instance as a result of a binary merger , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "our results would support a scenario in which planet - planet scattering excites the eccentricities and inclinations either before or early on in the migration process , so long as these are not damped during migration .    in this context , @xcite did a parametric study of type ii migration coupled with planet - planet scattering and found that in order to explain the observations disk migration requires that @xmath197 , where @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) is the time - derivative of the eccentricity ( semi - major axis ) . for eccentricity damping more efficient than this limit , planets end - up with eccentricities that are too small by the time they reach @xmath95 au .",
    "on the other hand , observational constraints from planet pairs thought to be trapped in orbital resonances during convergent migration @xcite , as well as hydrodynamic simulations ) disk - planet interaction can lead to eccentricity excitation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ]",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) seem to indicate that @xmath200 .",
    "this would mean that eccentricity damping occurs much faster than migration , so even if scattering excites eccentricities early on during migration these eccentricities would be damped by the time the planet migrated to @xmath95 au .",
    "this might pose a problem for disk - driven migration scenarios .",
    "direct hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the gravitational interaction between planets @xcite or planet population models @xcite might shed light on this issue .",
    "these difficulties with disk migration are not present ( or , at least , replaced with different difficulties ) in models of the formation of hot jupiters through high - eccentricity migration . in these models ,",
    "planets are scattered to high eccentricities and inclinations at large semi - major axes , and then migrate inwards through tidal dissipation by the host star .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that this mechanism can produce close - in planets in highly eccentric and inclined orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we carried out a large number of orbit integrations of close - in two- and three - planet systems ( 0.05 au@xmath24 au ) and studied whether planet - planet scattering can excite high - eccentricity and high - inclination orbits .",
    "we show that this mechanism is almost never able to excite eccentricities larger than @xmath201 and inclinations larger than @xmath166 , and the most likely outcome is typically @xmath1 and @xmath202 .    this remarkably low efficiency of eccentricity and inclination excitation results from the prevalence of planet - planet collisions , which is an unavoidable outcome of unstable systems in regimes where the circular velocity exceeds the escape velocity from the planets .",
    "we conclude that if planet - planet scattering is responsible for the highly eccentric and inclined planetary orbits seen in many exoplanets with small semi - major axes , then the scattering must have occurred at much larger orbital separations .",
    "this result constrains theories of planet formation by disk migration : the eccentricities and inclinations observed in extrasolar planets must be excited before or early in the migration process , and migration must shrink the semi - major axis by @xmath203 orders of magnitude without damping the eccentricity or inclination .",
