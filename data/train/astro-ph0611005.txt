    "the plot shows the reflection of a trailing spiral wave ( @xmath326 ) from the inner disk radius which gives rise to a leading spiral wave ( @xmath327 ) for @xmath328.,width=480 ]    with regard to the energy of the standing wave modes , notice that we now have in place of equations ( 28 ) separate equations for @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath329 , and @xmath330 .",

    "the sign of the time derivative is opposite that of schrdinger equation because the energy is negative for @xmath348 .    for the mentioned bound states , @xmath349 , where the tilde indicates a different normalization of the energy compared with equation ( 44 ) . for the unbound states or continuum modes we have @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
