    "is ferromagnetic with a curie temperature as high as 140k @xcite and mn content @xmath7 up to 0.1 .",
    "this class of iii - v diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are fabricated by means of low temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) which insures that most of mn atoms randomly substitute cations in their crystal positions .",
    "they are promising materials in spintronics due to their potential for tuning their ferromagnetic and electric properties by means of electrical field @xcite , optical excitation @xcite , or impurities @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic gamnas can be grown isomorphically within semiconductor structures and may be suitable for spin injection into gaas based devices @xcite .",
    "a complete theory of ferromagnetism in gamnas has yet to be established , but there is general agreement that a ferromagnetic coupling between local moments on the mn ions is mediated by holes moving through the lattice .",
    "a variety of different theoretical frameworks have been put forward , ranging from a mean - field approach with essentially free carriers@xcite to approaches that assume the carrier dynamics to be dominated by the proximity of the system to the metal insulator transition@xcite and the importance of disorder on the magnetic state@xcite . to date",
    "many of the claims regarding the relevance of these theories have been based upon their ability to predict the ferromagnetic transition temperature . in trying to distinguish between these many competing theories",
    "it is essential to explore as wide a range of physical properties as possible . noting that these alloys span a wide range of conductivities , measurements of electronic transport",
    "could be particularly useful in this regard .    since it is generally agreed that holes mediate the ferromagnetic interaction between mn ions the hole concentration is a crucial parameter for determining the properties of these materials .",
    "it influences essentially all their major properties @xcite .",
    "therefore it is also important to measure the carrier density and understand the physical factors that control it in order to improve our knowledge of these materials .",
    "however , the disorder in gamnas results in a carrier concentration ( @xmath5 ) that is generally lower than the mn density making an independent measurement of @xmath5 necessary .",
    "determination of the carrier density by means of the hall effect is complicated due to the presence of the anomalous hall contribution arising from the broken symmetry provided by the magnetisation . a conventional way to solve this problem is going to low temperatures and high ( above 20tesla ) magnetic fields where the magnetization and magnetoresistance saturate making possible to extract the ordinary hall coefficient @xcite .",
    "limited accessibility of this method has stimulated the search for other techniques of determining @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we measure the hall effect in a series of ga@xmath0mn@xmath8as samples at temperatures above @xmath9 in order to provide insight on both of these fronts ( testing our understanding and providing a means for measuring the carrier concentration ) .",
    "our results provide support for the recent theory of jungwirth _ _ et al__@xcite suggesting that a clean - limit theory can successfully describe transport in these materials over a range of compositions .",
    "we also demonstrate that hall measurements in this temperature range can be used to find the hole concentration without the need to resort to high magnetic fields .",
    "the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient in this paramagnetic regime may be described by a model that accounts for the paramagnetic contribution to the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) together with the ordinary hall effect ( ohe ) . with this model",
    "we demonstrate that the ahe can dominate the hall resistivity in gamnas even above room temperature .",
    "however , by properly accounting for this contribution the carrier concentration can be determined from the measurements .",
    "gamnas films were grown by means of mbe at a substrate temperature @xmath10c .",
    "the sample structures were as follows : semi - insulating gaas ( 100 ) substrate/100 nm of gaas deposited by mbe at @xmath11c/30100 nm of gaas deposited by mbe at @xmath12c / gamnas film with thicknesses of 123 nm or 300 nm .",
    "all films demonstrate an in - plane easy axis of the magnetization .",
    "the samples were patterned for transport measurements in a standard hall - bar geometry with dimensions between the longitudinal voltage contacts of @xmath13mm@xmath14 . for high - temperature hall and resistivity measurements we used an mmr technologies r2105 - 26 thermal stage system employing joule - thomson effect to vary sample temperatures in the range @xmath15k .",
    "the samples were mounted on the thermal stage with silicon grease and were kept in @xmath16mtorr vacuum during measurements .",
    "the thermal stage was placed between the poles of an electromagnet so that a dc magnetic field ( up to 5koe ) could be directed perpendicular to the sample plane .",
    "the samples were wired with golden wires and soldered with indium .",
    "the contacts worked even above the in melting point ( 430k ) since the wires were held on the sample by surface tension of liquid in .",
    "transport measurements above 80k were done using standard lock - in techniques with excitation current of @xmath17a and frequency @xmath18hz and also some of the results were confirmed with dc measurements using keithley current source 220 and nano - voltmeter 182 .",
    "each hall coefficient data point was obtained from the slope of a straight line fitted to at least 6 data points of the hall resistance vs. field curve for a magnetic field ranging from -5koe to + 5koe .",
    "we also did some measurements in van der pauw geometry which agreed with hall - bar measurements .",
    "the low temperature ( below 80k ) transport measurements were performed in a liquid he cryostat using quantum design digital bridge model 1802 with @xmath19a excitation current .",

    "we have measured the effect of annealing on the temperature dependence of the hall and bulk resistivities for three samples with @xmath7 equal 0.072 , 0.085 , and 0.087 which show an increase of the curie temperature of 21k , 25k , and 26k correspondingly upon annealing at @xmath128c for 2hrs . the measured data and their fits for @xmath107 are shown in fig .",

    "this phenomenon may limit the utility of our technique for samples with higher @xmath9 s which would require extending the fitting range to higher temperatures where the parallel conductance through an inversion layer or substrate becomes appreciable .",
    "the results of the hall effect measurements of a series of gamnas samples above the curie temperature and up to 380k can be described with a model equation which takes into account the ordinary and anomalous contributions to the hall resistivity .",
    "the good agreement between the measured and fitting hall data suggests that the model correctly captures the physical origin of the hall effect above @xmath9 and up to 380k .",
    "we found that the anomalous contribution to the hall resistivity dominates over ordinary contribution up to 380k in all samples .",

    "it is found that the temperature dependence of the anomalous hall effect above @xmath9 can be described with the curie - weiss law for the paramagnetic susceptibility with the inclusion of a small , negative , temperature and mn content independent correction to the susceptibility .",

    ". it may be due to the diamagnetic contribution from the gaas matrix , but demonstrating this will require an explanation for its anomalous size compared to the paramagnetic contribution .",
