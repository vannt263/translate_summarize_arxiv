    "due to the discrete nature of translation symmetry , motion of traveling waves here is inherently periodic , such that the dimension of the medium needs to be increased by one .",

    "more rigorously fitting the parameter @xmath290 would require a more accurate computation of the depinning threshold @xmath44 .",
    "after summarizing our point of view , we comment on a number of open questions related to the results here .",
    "our goal was to derive universal scaling laws near depinning transitions .",
    "our main result distills a framework in which depinning asymptotics are governed by power laws with exponent depending on the local dimension of the invariant measure near criticality , which captures power - law behavior in extreme - value statistics .",
    "the framework is inspired by symmetry considerations , viewing translations of the front as equivalent to shifts of the medium .",
    "those shifts of the medium are naturally viewed as a flow , which , as our main assumption , we view as being induced by a smooth flow on a smooth compact manifold , with an ergodic measure capturing the statistics of translates of the medium when considered in a local topology .",
    "the emphasis on symmetry and reduction to skew - product flows is inspired by @xcite , where motion on groups was forced by `` internal '' dynamics of fronts or other coherent structures .",
    "as such , our results rely crucially on smoothness of extensions .",
    "we view ergodicity as somewhat more natural , given that flows on a manifold always possess ergodic measures .",
    "when constructing the reduced skew - product flow in a more concrete example , we noticed a subtle condition , requiring bounds on spatial lyapunov exponents of the medium in terms of exponential convergence rates of the front .      at @xmath103 , the critical threshold for depinning",
    ", the medium supports a pinned front  in the support of the ergodic measure , therefore not necessarily in the given fixed medium . since therefore @xmath291 for all times , we conclude that @xmath147 is unbounded  otherwise the limiting position would be a pinned front by continuity . on the other hand",
    ", the rate of growth of @xmath49 depends very much on the dimension and on the particular medium .",
    "clearly , trajectories are bounded in one - dimensional media . in quasi - periodic media ,",
    "the orbit is bounded whenever the critical medium @xmath136 is a specific shift of the given medium , that is , the maximum lies on the given trajectory on the torus . for most media @xmath122 , however , this will not be the case , and the front position will not be bounded . for dimensions",
    "@xmath181 , the propagation will be ballistic with limiting speed the continuous limit of speeds for @xmath149 , as one can readily see from the calculation of the speed , exploiting that the singular integral converges for @xmath103 . for dimensions @xmath292",
    ", we expect propagation to be sub - ballistic .",
    "heuristically , times spent near the pinned front scale with @xmath293 , where @xmath193 is a variable parameterizing a section to the flow for @xmath193 on @xmath94 near the pinned value @xmath136 ; see remark [ r : geo ] for a description of geometry .",
    "we then expect that @xmath294 at times @xmath295 , which , for @xmath296 asymptotically uniformly distributed according to a @xmath297-dimensional measure in the section , gives @xmath298 which then gives @xmath299 a similar calculation for @xmath115 gives @xmath300      in the case of two - dimensional quasi - periodic media , the expansion coefficient is in fact explicit , given quadratic terms of the minimum and the dependence on @xmath137 .",
    "consider therefore the inhomogeneity @xmath301 , which gives the reduced vector field expansion @xmath302 with @xmath303 assuming @xmath304 , we find minima at @xmath305 , and an expansion @xmath306 , which leads depinning thresholds @xmath307 to depinning asymptotics for the ergodic integral @xmath308 similar calculations are possible whenever the measure @xmath95 is known explicitly .      beyond ballistic asymptotics ,",
    "corresponding to the ergodic average , one could ask for rates of convergence .",
    "in quasi - periodic media , one encounters subtle dependence on frequencies @xcite , with convergence @xmath309 for `` good '' irrational numbers , which gives bounded deviations , hence not quite asymptotic phase to an appropriately shifted uniformly translating front of speed @xmath310 .",
    "the correction to @xmath311 is usually referred to as the discrepancy , for which @xmath312 bounds are usually optimal , and bounds @xmath313 are common for ( positive measure ) diophantine numbers .    for `` chaotic '' media ,",
    "we expect brownian deviations , as is common for ergodic averages ; see @xcite for general background and @xcite for results on fronts .",
    "deviations can , however , be arbitrarily slowly decaying @xcite .",
    "there clearly is a multitude of possible extensions . in immediate generalizations",
    ", one could focus on averages as @xmath258 , only , allowing for `` heteroclinic '' media with ergodic measures on the limit sets with respect to right shifts in a local topology .",
    "one could also allow more directly for random samplings of the medium .",
    "generalizations that affect the scalings more directly are degenerate minima , or , more interestingly , minima that occur at the boundary of the support of @xmath95 , such that @xmath314 at @xmath136 . in that case",
    ", one could obtain integrals of the type @xmath315 , resulting in asymptotics @xmath316 .    beyond the more narrow scope of one - dimensional inhomogeneous media",
    ", one could look at time - dependent media , periodic , quasi - periodic , or random , or even consider higher dimensional wave - fronts ; see for instance @xcite for results in lattices . in a different direction , motion of localized pulses in higher - dimensional media presents intriguing other possibilities , such as determining the direction of drift . in this context , relaxation towards translational goldstone modes may be much slower , due to interaction with continuous spectra , present whenever the `` traveling wave '' is not spatially localized . in this direction , one may also wish to study the effect of long - range interactions , such as through nonlocal coupling @xmath317 , @xmath318 a weakly localized convolution kernel .",
    "more modestly , one would also wish to establish the validity of the hypotheses used in our main theorem beyond a weak inhomogeneity context , or , at least , specify numerical computations that would allow for a ( semi-)rigorous verification ."
