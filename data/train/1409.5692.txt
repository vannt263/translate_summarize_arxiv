    "one of the most fundamental concepts in quantum physics is entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this property plays a central role in a host of quantum technologies , including metrology , imaging , communication , and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "protocols in each of these domains rely upon the existence of nonclassical correlations among a multitude of subsystems within a multimode state  @xcite . as such , reliable ,",
    "readily implementable , and versatile means of characterizing entanglement are essential for assessing the utility of certain states as well as understanding the fundamental physics underlying quantum interactions .",
    "one method for identifying entanglement is formulated in terms of positive  but not completely positive  maps .",
    "the most prominent example of such a map is the partial transposition ( pt )  @xcite . for bipartite gaussian states , which are completely characterized by the covariance matrix",
    ", it has been shown that the pt criterion is necessary and sufficient to identify entanglement  @xcite . in the multipartite case , however , the pt criteria can only diagnose entanglement among bipartitions .",
    "moreover , bound entangled gaussian states are known to exist whose entanglement can not be detected with the pt criterion .",
    "such states have been formulated in theory and also realized in experiments  @xcite . additionally , a number of moment - based entanglement probes have been successfully deployed to characterize entanglement , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these criteria have been enormously successful at experimentally diagnosing entanglement among various beams  @xcite or among different parties of a multimode beam  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "several studies have acquired the covariance matrix for a multidimensional state , which enables implementation of the pt criterion as a means for examining the nonclassical correlations among multiple beams  @xcite . in each of these situations , however , the employed methods restrict multipartite dynamics to the set of all possible bipartite state divisions .",
    "another well - established method for identifying entanglement is formulated in terms of entanglement witnesses  @xcite . in particular , the _ separability eigenvalue equations _ have recently been introduced as a method for constructing optimal witnesses  @xcite .",
    "the solutions of these coupled equations yield powerful entanglement assessments not only for bipartite divisions but also for high - order multipartite divisions of discrete and continuous variable quantum systems .",
    "this letter formulates entanglement conditions for multimode gaussian states and subsequently demonstrates their application on an experimentally realized quantum ultrafast frequency comb .",
    "this quantum state , which is generated by the parametric down - conversion of a classical frequency comb , was recently shown to exhibit bipartite entanglement among its underlying frequency bands  @xcite .",
    "the covariance matrix for this high - dimensional quantum object has been measured , which renders it a unique test bed for exploring novel multipartite entanglement metrics .",
    "importantly , we will show in this letter that the criteria developed from the separability eigenvalue equations are able to examine nonclassical aspects of the frequency comb not feasible with strictly bipartite methods . within this class of criteria ,",
    "the significance of the verified entanglement is optimized with a genetic algorithm , which allows us to fully verify the entanglement present in highly complex multiparty quantum systems . for the 10-mode system considered here ,",
    "entanglement is certified for each of the 115974 possible nontrivial mode partitions .",
    "gaussian states are described by a gaussian characteristic function on a multimode phase space ( for an introduction , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the amplitude and phase quadratures of individual modes are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and a vector of quadratures is defined as @xmath2 the covariance matrix @xmath3 is then specified by its entries @xmath4 first - order moments are irrelevant for entanglement since local unitary displacement operations may be applied to yield @xmath5 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can assume that all of the information for a gaussian state is contained in its second - order moments .",
    "the initial set of @xmath6 orthonormal modes , on which the multimode quantum state is defined , can be decomposed into many different partitions , each one distributing the @xmath6 modes in @xmath7 different and complementary subsystems @xmath8 , with @xmath7 being any integer between @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "a quantum state is considered entangled with respect to a given mode partitioning if one is not able to write it as a statistical mixture of product density matrices @xmath10 , where @xmath11 describes a quantum state in subsystem @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the case @xmath14 consists of @xmath15 mode bipartitions , which are the only ones addressed by the pt criterion .",
    "however , even if entanglement does not exist among certain bipartitions , it may be present in higher - order partitions , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "considering that the total number of state partitions is given by the bell number and increases rapidly as a function of @xmath6  @xcite , the pt criterion addresses only a very small subset of the rich variety of possible partitionings .",
    "the multipartite entanglement of a quantum state @xmath17 may be probed with the use of a general hermitian operator @xmath18  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the state under question is entangled with respect to a given @xmath7 partition if and only if it may be shown that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the minimum expectation value of @xmath18 among all separable states of the @xmath7 partition .",
    "it was established in ref .",
    "@xcite that this minimization problem can be solved with a set of coupled eigenvalue equations , denoted as separability eigenvalue equations .",
    "the resulting minimal separability eigenvalue is identical to @xmath20 .",
    "the most general form of the operator @xmath18 for continuous variable gaussian states is given as @xmath21 in which the coefficients of @xmath22 are freely adjustable .",
    "accordingly , attention may be restricted to the state s covariance matrix .",
    "correlations between the amplitude and phase quadratures are negligible for the presently studied states , which allows the test operator @xmath18 to be cast as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are coefficient matrices of the same dimensionality as the corresponding state covariance matrix , and the indices @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to amplitude - amplitude and phase - phase correlations , respectively .",
    "the expectation value of this test operator readily follows and is written as  @xcite @xmath28 likewise , the minimal separability eigenvalue @xmath29 for operators of this form has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and reads as @xmath30^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the submatrices of @xmath22 that contain only the rows and columns of the modes within @xmath32 .",
    "the solution for general gaussian test operators is given in ref .",
    ".    a partition s entanglement is characterized in terms of its statistical significance @xmath33 , which compares the difference between the expectation value @xmath34 and its separable bound @xmath29 to the experimental standard deviation @xmath35 : @xmath36 which is the considered entanglement metric .",
    "the experimental error @xmath35 is determined through error propagation of @xmath37 and yields @xmath38 ^ 2[\\sigma(c_{xx}^{ji})]^2+[m_{pp}^{ij}]^2[\\sigma(c_{pp}^{ji})]^2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the measured errors corresponding to the covariance elements @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "a partition is considered to be entangled if @xmath43 , and the statistical significance of its nonseparability is assessed with @xmath44 .",
    "the coefficient matrix @xmath22 may be freely tuned in order to maximize the significance of each partition , @xmath45 .",
    "this optimization is achieved with a _ genetic algorithm _ ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "femtosecond frequency combs contain upwards of @xmath46 individual frequency components , and the simultaneous down - conversion of all of these frequencies in a nonlinear crystal inserted in an optical cavity initiates a network of frequency correlations that extends across the width of the resultant comb  @xcite .",
    "the laser source utilized to create the entangled comb is a titanium : sapphire mode - locked oscillator that delivers @xmath47 fwhm pulses ( @xmath48 ) centered at 795 nm with a repetition rate of 76mhz .",
    "this pulse train is frequency doubled , which serves to pump a below - threshold optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) containing a 2 mm bibo crystal  @xcite .",
    "the state exiting the opo is analyzed with homodyne detection , in which the spectral composition of the local oscillator ( lo ) is modified with an ultrafast pulse shaper capable of independent amplitude and phase modulation  @xcite .",
    "the lo spectrum is partitioned in either 4 , 6 , or 10 bands of equal energy . by scanning the relative phase between the down - converted comb and the lo , the @xmath49 and @xmath50 quadrature noises are measured from the state projected onto the spectral composition of the lo mode .",
    "the quadrature noises are then recorded for each spectral region as well as all possible pairs of regions . upon doing so ,",
    "a covariance matrix is assembled that furnishes a good approximation of the full quantum state .",
    "cross correlations of the form @xmath51 are observed to be negligible , which enables the covariance matrix to be expressed in a block diagonal form , i.e. , one block for the @xmath49 quadrature and another for the @xmath50 quadrature  @xcite ; cf .",
    "eq .  . from the data contained in the covariance matrix , it is possible to extract special modes , called _ supermodes _ , that are the eigenmodes of the parametric interaction  @xcite and",
    "are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "they turn out to be significantly squeezed  @xcite , as shown in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the existence of squeezed supermodes that span the entire frequency spectrum is at the origin of the entanglement that exists between the frequency bands .    .",
    "the highest supermode squeezing ( sqz . ) and antisqueezing levels of the considered 4- , 6- , and 10-mode quantum comb states .",
    "all of the noise levels are specified in decibels ( db ) . [ cols= \"",
    "> , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]       for the 10-mode frequency - comb gaussian state .",
    ", width=302 ]    it is worth noting that the number of analyzed frequency bands is currently limited by the optical resolution of the pulse shaper .",
    "a new generation of the setup should allow for observing at least 30 frequency modes as predicted by theory in the present experimental conditions .",
    "we implemented covariance - based , high - order entanglement criteria on the multimode squeezed states contained within an ultrafast frequency comb .",
    "a genetic algorithm was exploited to maximize the statistical significance of the determined entanglement . upon doing so , the criterion identifies entanglement in all of the 14 , 202 , and 115974 nontrivial partitions of the 4- , 6- , and 10-mode scenarios , respectively .",
    "consequently , the quantum comb exhibits full multipartite entanglement , i.e. , entanglement for all partitionings .",
    "importantly , the currently employed criterion was able to identify entanglement not recognizable with traditional separability metrics .",
    "the present approach allows for the identification of partially and fully entangled states for applications in quantum communication or cluster state computation .",
