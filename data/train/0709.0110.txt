    "nonvanishing neutrino magnetic moment leads to various chirality - flipping processes where the left - handed neutrinos produced in the stellar interior become the right - handed ones , i.e. sterile with respect to the weak interaction , and this can be important e.g. for the stellar energy - loss . in the standard model extended to include the neutrino mass @xmath3 , the well - known result for the neutrino magnetic moment is  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bohr magneton .",
    "thus , it is unobservably small given the known limits on neutrino masses .",
    "on the other hand , nontrivial extensions of the standard model such as left - right symmetry can lead to more significant values for the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "first attempts of exploiting the mechanism of the neutrino chirality flipping were connected with the solar neutrino problem , and two different scenarios were analysed .",
    "the first one , based on the neutrino magnetic moment rotation in a stellar magnetic field , was investigated in the papers  @xcite@xcite . in the second scenario ,",
    "a neutrino changed the chirality due to the electromagnetic interaction of its magnetic moment with plasma  @xcite . for a more extended list of references",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . in all these cases the effect appeared to be small to have an essential impact on the solar neutrino problem , if @xmath6 .",
    "a more significant constraints on @xmath7 are provided by other stars .",
    "for example , the cores of low - mass red giants are about @xmath8 times denser than the sun , and nonstandard neutrino losses would have a more essential effect there , delaying the ignition of heluim .",
    "thus , the limit was obtained  @xcite : @xmath9 an independent constraint on the magnetic moment of a neutrino was also obtained from the early universe  @xcite : @xmath10 where spin - flip collisions would populate the sterile dirac components in the era before the decoupling of the neutrinos .",
    "thus , it doubles the effective number of thermally excited neutrino degrees of freedom and increases the expansion rate of the universe , causing the overabundance of helium .",
    "a considerable interest to the neutrino magnetic moment arised after the great event of sn1987a , in connection with the modelling of a supernova explosion , where gigantic neutrino fluxes define in fact the process energetics .",
    "it means that such a microscopic neutrino characteristic , as the neutrino magnetic moment , would have a critical influence on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events .",
    "namely , the left - handed neutrinos produced inside the supernova core during the collapse , could convert into the right - handed neutrinos due to the magnetic moment interaction .",
    "these sterile neutrinos would escape from the core leaving no energy to explain the observed neutrino luminosity of the supernova .",
    "thus , the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment can be established .",
    "this matter was investigated by many authors in different aspects  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we will mainly focus on the paper by r. barbieri and r.  n. mohapatra  @xcite which now looks as the most reliable instant constraint on the neutrino magnetic moment from sn1987a , according to  @xcite .",
    "the authors  @xcite considered the neutrino spin - flip via both @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering processes in the inner core of a supernova immediately after the collapse . imposing for the @xmath1 luminosity @xmath13 the upper limit of @xmath14 ergs / s ,",
    "the authors obtained the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment : @xmath15    however , the essential plasma polarization effects in the photon propagator were not considered in  @xcite , and the photon dispersion was taken in a phenomenolical way , by inserting an _ ad hoc _ thermal mass into the vacuum photon propagator .",
    "a detailed investigation of this question was performed in the papers by a. ayala , j.  c. dolivo and m. torres  @xcite , who used the formalism of the thermal field theory to take into account the influence of hot dense astrophysical plasma on the photon propagator .",
    "the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment compared with the result of the paper  @xcite , was improved in  @xcite in the factor of 2 : @xmath16 however , looking at the intermediate analytical results by the authors  @xcite , one can see that only the contribution of plasma electrons was taken into account there , while the proton fraction was omitted .",
    "this is despite the fact that the electron and proton contributions to the neutrino spin - flip process were evaluated in  @xcite to be of the same order .",
    "thus , the reason exists to reconsider the neutrino spin - flip processes in the supernova core more attentively .    in this paper , we perform such an analysis , and we show in part , that the proton contribution into the photon propagator is not less essential , than the electron contribution .",
    "we consider the dirac neutrinos only , because in this case the neutrino magnetic moment interaction ( both diagonal and non - diagonal ) with a photon transforms the active left - handed neutrinos into the right - handed neutrinos which are sterile with respect to the weak interaction .",
    "we do not consider the majorana neutrinos , because the produced right - handed antineutrino states are not sterile in this case .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] with calculations of the amplitude of the neutrino spin - flip process due to the neutrino scattering off plasma components .",

    "[ sec : summary ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the neutrino chirality flip is caused by the scattering via the intermediate photon ( plasmon ) off the plasma electromagnetic current presented by electrons , @xmath11 , protons , @xmath12 , etc .",
    "the total process lagrangian consists of two parts , the first one is the interaction of a neutrino having a magnetic moment @xmath17 ( both diagonal and transition ) with photons , while the second part describes the plasma interaction with photons : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the tensor of the photon electromagnetic field , @xmath21 is the elementary charge , @xmath22 is an electromagnetic current in the general sense , formed by different components of the medium , i.e. free electrons and positrons , protons , free ions , etc . here",

    "the only principal point is to use the photon propagator @xmath30 with the plasma polarization effects taken into account .",
    "we use the straightforward way of taking account of these effects by summation of the feynman diagrams of the forward photon scattering off plasma particles . similarly to the vacuum case , this summation leads to the dyson equation which provides a correct result for the photon propagator in plasma in the region where the photon polarization operator is real , in the form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the eigenvalues of the photon polarization tensor @xmath33 for the transverse and longitudinal plasmon , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the corresponding density matrices    @xmath36    @xmath37 is the four - vector of the plasma velocity .",

    "however , it could be essential in the upper layers of the supernova envelope , which are believed to be rich in iron .",
    "here we present the detailed calculation of the tensor integral  ( [ eq : t_int ] ) : @xmath154",

    "this vector and the four - vector @xmath157 are the building bricks for constructing the tensor @xmath64 .",
    "this tensor is symmetric because the electromagnetic current @xmath158 is real .",
    "the tensor is also orthogonal to the four - vector @xmath157 because of the electromagnetic current conservation .",
    "there exist only two independent structures having these properties , which are the density matrices  ( [ eq : rho_t ] ) and  ( [ eq : rho_l ] ) , and thus one can write : @xmath159    because of orthogonality of the tensors @xmath160 and @xmath161 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : project_oper ] ) , one obtains @xmath162 as we show below , just these integrals  ( [ eq : a_t ] ) and  ( [ eq : a_l ] ) define the widths of absorption ( at @xmath163 ) and creation ( at @xmath164 ) of a plasmon by the plasma particles .",
    "really , let us consider for definiteness the width of absorption of the transversal plasmon by plasma particles forming the electromagnetic current @xmath28 .",

    "the connection should be used here between the imaginary part @xmath173 and the width of creation of the transversal plasmon : @xmath179 it is essential also that the function @xmath173 is odd : @xmath180 and this is the feature of the retarded polarization operator .    performing the similar calculations",
    ", one can see that the relation  ( [ eq : a_t3 ] ) is valid for the longitudinal plasmon also .",
