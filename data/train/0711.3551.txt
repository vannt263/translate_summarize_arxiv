    "the characterization of dynamical excitations of a system is one of the fundamental tasks in condensed matter physics . for quantum systems",
    "the problem is obtaining the correct description of the many - particle wave functions .",
    "for many - particle nonlinear classical systems the main difficulty is relating the excitations to families of trajectories in phase space .    because a generic classical hamiltonian system is non - integrable , it will evolve chaotically on large observation times for almost any initial condition .",
    "hamiltonian chaos describes the decay of excitations on large time scales .",
    "the excitations are typically characterized by nonchaotic trajectories .",
    "kolmogorov , arnold , and moser ( kam ) showed that regular dynamics on invariant @xmath1-dimensional tori persists in many non - integrable systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom @xmath1.@xcite especially important are the simplest realizations of low - dimensional invariant structures ",
    "periodic orbits .",
    "periodic orbits exist even in strongly chaotic systems and can densely fill the chaotic phase space volume despite having zero measure ( just like the rational numbers fill the space of real numbers ) .",
    "periodic orbits are the most natural class of regular trajectories which can describe excitations .",
    "an example of such excitations are discrete breathers .",
    "they are periodic solutions of nonlinear lattice systems localized in the direct space that persist in infinite lattices.@xcite    periodic orbits can be computed numerically with high accuracy for large systems . therefore computational approaches can often help in characterizing dynamical excitations , especially when combined with analytical arguments . in the following",
    "we will show how such methods allow us to successfully study one of the most famous problems in computational and statistical physics  the fermi - pasta - ulam problem .",
    "in 1953 enrico fermi , john pasta , and stanislav ulam studied the problem of energy redistribution between the linear normal modes of an anharmonic atomic chain and published the results as an internal report of the los alamos national laboratory .",
    "@xcite they used one of the first available computers with modern architecture , and performed what can be called one of the first computational experiments .    the equations of motion describe @xmath1 particles with a nonlinear interaction between nearest neighbors , with either quadratic ( the @xmath2-fpu model ) @xmath3,\\ ] ] or cubic terms ( the @xmath4-fpu model ) @xmath5.\\ ] ] the coordinate @xmath6 corresponds to the displacement of the @xmath7th particle from its equilibrium position .",
    "the particle mass and harmonic spring constant are assumed to be one .",
    "+    fixed boundary conditions @xmath8 are used . the canonical transformation @xmath9 diagonalizes and solves the linear problem @xmath10 using the normal mode coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "the mode number @xmath12 relates each of these modes to their corresponding normal mode frequency @xmath13 .",
    "the equations of motion in normal mode space become @xmath14 for the @xmath2-fpu chain in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath15 for the @xmath4-fpu chain in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the interaction coefficients @xmath16 @xmath17 give the coupling between the modes .",
    "the coupling is nonlinear , selective , and does not have a characteristic interaction range ( or distance ) in normal mode space .",
    "thus , even very distant modes in normal mode space are coupled . in the absence of this interaction there",
    "exist @xmath1 integrals of motion which correspond to the energies of the normal modes @xmath18 .",
    "fermi , pasta , and ulam considered the evolution of the nonlinear chain with the single mode @xmath19 with the lowest frequency initially excited.@xcite they used standard numerical schemes to approximate the differential equations and monitored the state of the system for times which are orders of magnitude larger than the largest periods of oscillation of the normal modes .",
    "it was expected that after some time other modes would become excited as well , and the energy would eventually be equally distributed over the entire spectrum .",
    "that was the way they anticipated a transition to thermal equilibrium .",
    "to their big surprise they observed the opposite result ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the energy stayed localized in several low frequency modes for times that are orders of magnitude larger than the typical oscillation periods of these normal modes .",
    "recurrences of almost all the energy into the initially excited mode were observed as well .",
    "later computational studies revealed that there exist energy thresholds and system size thresholds above which equipartition was observed on relatively short time scales.@xcite many questions arise .",
    "why is the energy localized in a few modes below the thresholds ?",
    "why does the energy spread quickly into the entire spectrum above the thresholds ?",
    "how do the threshold values scale with the parameters of the system ?",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the mode energy density distribution @xmath20 for an initial energy that is larger than the one considered in ref .  , but yet well below the above mentioned thresholds .",
    "the distributions are plotted on a logarithmic scale and for times @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "because the mode energies are time - dependent , the densities were averaged over a time interval of @xmath23 .",
    "we observe exponential localization of the energy distribution in normal mode space , which was first noted by galgani and scotti.@xcite such a distribution is formed on a very short time scale @xmath24,and possesses a core  the few modes which are strongly excited  and a tail of exponentially weakly excited modes . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a slow resonant pumping of energy from the core of the distribution into its tails for later times .",
    "this process ultimately brings the system to equipartition , but on the much larger time scale @xmath25 .",
    "fermi , pasta , and ulam@xcite performed their numerical studies at lower energies , and therefore @xmath26 was even larger in their case .",
    "if the initial energy is further increased , a threshold value may be reached for which the time scale of the core - tail pumping becomes comparable with the transition time to the exponential distribution @xmath27.@xcite below these threshold values the time scales differ by orders of magnitudes , and the evolution on times @xmath28 corresponds to the observations of ref .  .",
    "fermi , pasta , and ulam viewed their observations as a problem of ( perhaps complete ) the absence of equipartition ( that is , ergodicity )  a problem now known as the fpu problem . from a contemporary perspective",
    ", the fpu problem can be reformulated as the following set of questions :    * why are there at least two qualitatively different time scales @xmath24 and @xmath26 ? * are there low - dimensional invariant manifolds in phase space which approximate the dynamics of the fpu trajectories for times less than @xmath26 ? * can we estimate the localization length of the exponentially localized energy distribution in normal mode space ? * is the localization length related to the time scales ? * does the fpu observation hold in the limit of infinite systems , as well as in two- and three - dimensional systems ?",
    "there is a long history of studies of the fpu problem , @xcite which , even if not directly answering all of these questions , defined new fields of research in nonlinear dynamics , chaos theory , and soliton theory .",
    "from the results of sec .  [ sec2 ] we may conjecture that the exponentially localized state observed on the fpu trajectory is a long - lived excitation , which is destroyed after time @xmath26 .",
    "therefore ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] ) we anticipate that this excitation is close to an exact periodic orbit for times @xmath29",
    ". then the observed dynamics will be almost regular .",
    "such a periodic orbit will correspond to a slightly deformed normal mode .",
    "there exists a rigorous method of constructing such a periodic orbit , starting from the linear limit @xmath10.@xcite in this limit the periodic orbit is given by exciting a single mode with mode number @xmath30 with an energy @xmath31 . with these conditions we isolate a unique periodic orbit in the multi - dimensional phase space of the system .",
    "the linear spectrum of the fpu chain obeys the non - resonance condition@xcite @xmath32 for all integer @xmath7 and @xmath33 .",
    "this condition allows us to apply a theorem due to lyapunov,@xcite which states that the original periodic orbit can be continued into the domain of nonzero nonlinearity for fixed energy.@xcite continuation means that close to the periodic orbit of the linear system we will find a new periodic orbit in the phase space of the nonlinear system with identical energy @xmath31 .",
    "this new periodic orbit , being a closed loop in phase space , can be viewed as a continuous deformation of the periodic orbit of the linear system , as the nonlinearity is increased .",
    "the numerical methods of constructing @xmath0-breathers @xcite use the fact that a periodic orbit corresponds to a fixed point in the generalized poincar maps ( sections ) in phase space . let us explain one of the possible realizations of such a numerical scheme in more detail .",
    "we consider initial conditions for which all normal mode velocities @xmath34 .",
    "then the kinetic energy at @xmath35 is exactly zero .",
    "note that the kinetic energy is given by the one - half of the sum over all squared mode velocities , and the total energy is conserved during the integration .",
    "we construct a @xmath1-dimensional vector where each component is the amplitude of a given mode .",
    "this vector represents the configuration space of the system .",
    "then we integrate the equations of motion numerically , until the velocity @xmath36 crosses zero two times ( because an oscillator needs two turning points to return to its initial state ) . at that moment we again measure all mode amplitudes , and obtain a second ( final ) vector .",
    "if the initial and final vectors coincide , the potential energies coincide as well .",
    "therefore the kinetic energy at the final time will be zero , and our initial condition is located on a periodic orbit .",
    "the period of the orbit can be determined by computing the time we needed to reach the final vector .",
    "what if the final vector does not coincide with the initial one ?",
    "then we compute the difference vector between the final and initial vectors .",
    "it will also have @xmath1 components .",
    "our task is to slightly vary the initial vector components such that all the components of the difference vector shrink to zero . in other words",
    ", we are trying to zero @xmath1 functions ( the components of the difference vector ) by varying @xmath1 variables ( the components of the initial vector ) .",
    "generalized newton - raphson methods will do the job if the initial vector is suitably close to a desired solution .",
    "because the final vector is the outcome of a map in configurational space , we can also say that we are looking for a fixed point of that map . if we want to find a fixed point for a given total energy ( or some other constraint ) we have to limit the variations of the initial vector accordingly . for practical reasons it is convenient to first fix the amplitude of mode @xmath37 to a given value @xmath38 to find the corresponding periodic orbit , calculate its energy , and then to vary @xmath38 such that the desired energy value is realized .",
    "once a periodic orbit is obtained , we also compute its stability properties .",
    "a periodic orbit is said to be ( marginally ) stable if a small perturbation of the orbit in phase space does not grow in time ; otherwise it is unstable .",
    "the initial smallness of the perturbation allows us to perform a linearization of the phase space flow around the periodic orbit ( see ref .   for details ) . in practice",
    "it amounts to the following procedure .",
    "take a reference point on the periodic orbit .",
    "consider @xmath39 small perturbations in the @xmath39 different directions in phase space .",
    "integrate each of these perturbations over one period of the orbit , and obtain a new ( still quite small ) perturbation .",
    "the components of these final perturbations define a floquet matrix , which maps any initial perturbation into a final one .",
    "the matrix is symplectic.@xcite in a nutshell , if @xmath40 is an eigenvalue of a symplectic matrix , so are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "compute the eigenvalues of that matrix .",
    "any eigenvalue which is located on the unit circle in the complex plane corresponds to a perturbation that does not grow in time .",
    "eigenvalues outside the unit circle correspond to perturbations which grow exponentially fast in time .",
    "note that each eigenvalue outside the unit circle has a symmetry - related partner inside the unit circle due to the symplectic properties of the floquet matrix .",
    "the interested reader may consult ref .",
    ", where details of the ways to compute and analyze periodic orbits are discussed .",
    "the dynamics of the continued periodic orbit incorporates many normal modes , because nonlinearity induces mode - mode interactions . the numerical procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] was used and new periodic orbits were found .",
    "the amplitude and energy distributions of the normal modes in such a periodic orbit turn out to be exponentially localized ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "we call these solutions @xmath0-breathers ; they are periodic in time and localized in normal mode space .",
    "note that the shape of the energy distribution of @xmath0-breathers is remarkably close to the one of the fpu - trajectory for @xmath43 and identical parameters ( energy @xmath31 and seed mode number @xmath30 ) .",
    "any numerical evaluation should , if possible , be accompanied by analytical considerations . for @xmath0-breathers that is possible with the help of standard perturbation approaches . for the case of low - frequency modes",
    "the energy distribution in the @xmath0-breather has been estimated to be@xcite @xmath44    -breathers for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the dashed line is the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq8]).@xcite ]    the @xmath0-breathers are localized in normal mode space if mode energies shrink with increasing distance from @xmath30 . from eq .",

    "( [ eq8 ] ) predicts the parameter values for which a @xmath0-breather delocalizes .",
    "if this condition is reached upon variation of a parameter , we say that a delocalization threshold has been reached .",
    "if we vary a second parameter , we can keep @xmath53 unchanged . in this way we can vary all parameters , keep @xmath53 constant , and obtain scaling relations between all the parameters .",
    "the inverse localization length @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 the @xmath0-breather delocalizes , which implies @xmath57 . these are , among many others , predictions which can be tested by comparing to @xmath0-breather solutions and fpu - trajectories , which are obtained using the previously described computational methods .    the numerical results and the estimate in eq .  ( [ eq8 ] )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath0-breather solutions are linearly stable.@xcite the agreement between the computations and theory is very good , especially for strongly localized energy profiles .",
    "note that in real space the energy distributions are delocalized both for the fpu and for the @xmath0-breather trajectories , and do not show remarkable features.@xcite      if we apply the perturbation methods we have mentioned to the @xmath4-fpu problem , we arrive at the result for the energy distribution in the @xmath0-breather:@xcite @xmath58 the necessary condition for the localization of the @xmath0-breather is @xmath59 .",

    "the asymptotic result for @xmath40 fails , although the exponential profile of the mode energies still holds .",
    "the @xmath0-breathers become unstable if @xmath63,@xcite but as long as they remain strongly localized , the fpu trajectories do not delocalize quickly.@xcite remarkably the fpu trajectory shows a change from regular to weakly chaotic dynamics in its core when increasing the initial energy @xmath31 above a certain value.@xcite this value corresponds to the condition for changing the stability of the @xmath0-breather .",
    "it is well known that for nonintegrable hamiltonian systems , chaotic trajectories appear close to an unstable periodic orbit.@xcite    why does the instability of the @xmath0-breather , and the chaotic dynamics close to it , not destroy the exponential localization of the mode energy profile ?",
    "the answer might be that a @xmath0-breather which is well localized in normal mode space does not allow for a resonant interaction between core and tail modes , because if such a resonance was present , it would lead to a delocalization of the periodic orbit itself .",
    "instabilities in the core of the distribution , that is , resonances between modes inside the core , are what is left .",
    "they can lead to a chaotic dynamics inside the core , but not to a delocalization , due to the absence of resonances between the core and the tail modes .",

    "[ fig5 ] the energy distributions for the fpu and @xmath0-breather trajectories are shown.@xcite the only difference from low frequencies is that for the @xmath2-fpu model high and low frequency modes become excited in pairs , in agreement with the predictions of perturbation theory.@xcite",
    "the condition for applying lyapunov s theorem to the continuation of a @xmath0-breather is the absence of resonances ( see eq .",

    "a finite system has a discrete spectrum and thus lyapunov s theorem is applicable .",
    "a generalization of the results in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] has been performed by considering finite lattices with spatial dimensions @xmath64 and 3 . instead of mode numbers we now have mode vectors with @xmath65 integer components .",

    "for other values of @xmath1 we probe @xmath40 with different seed wave numbers @xmath82 in the vicinity of @xmath83 .",
    "the continuous behavior of @xmath84 ( see fig .  [ fig7](b ) ) , irrespective of system size @xmath1 , confirms these conclusions for macroscopic systems .",

    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) and calculate the slope @xmath86 of the energy density distribution ( on a logarithmic scale):@xcite @xmath87 the absolute value of @xmath86 equals the inverse localization length @xmath88 .",
    "the slope @xmath86 depends on the seed wave number @xmath82 and on the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath89 , which is determined by the product of the energy density @xmath75 and the nonlinearity strength @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath94 we estimate @xmath95 , and for @xmath96 we obtain @xmath97.@xcite it follows that for a given energy density there exists a seed wave number @xmath98 for which the @xmath0-breather is most strongly localized .",
    "moreover , @xmath0-breathers tend to delocalize for @xmath99 , that is , in the limit of long wavelength .",
    "these analytical predictions may now be compared to careful numerical computations of @xmath0-breathers .",
    "the analytical and numerical results are compared in fig .",
    "the numerical results confirm that the localization length does not depend on the system size .",
    "we also observe the minimum @xmath100 whose depth and location vary with the energy as expected . a systematic mismatch between the theory and the numerical results for small @xmath82",
    "is caused by higher order corrections to the perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath0-breathers from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath101 and 24 correspond to the most left symbol on the middle curve in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the minimum on that curve , and a point to the right of it , respectively .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) that the quantity @xmath102 depends on a single variable , namely the dimensionless seed wave number @xmath103 .",
    "it implies that knowing this single master slope function is sufficient to predict the localization property of any @xmath0-breather , at any energy , any seed wave number , etc . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the dependence of @xmath104 is shown together with the rescaled numerical data from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .    despite the systematic mismatch between the numerical data and the theoretical prediction for small @xmath105 , the scaled numerical data collapse to a single curve .",

    "analogous results have been obtained for the @xmath2-fpu model , and for both fpu models for seed wave numbers with frequencies near the upper edge of the spectrum @xmath106 .",
    "the reason for the delocalization of @xmath0-breathers at the edges of the linear spectrum are resonances between normal mode frequencies : @xmath107 for low frequency modes and @xmath108 for high frequency modes .",
    "thus it is expected that the excited mode with a wave number close to an edge of the spectrum will decay into many other modes , and the two time scales @xmath57 .",
    "these time scales must diverge in the limit of small frequencies , due to conservation of total mechanical momentum .",
    "hence the time scale @xmath109 of the simulation is important .",
    "suppose we excite a normal mode that is close to a well - localized @xmath0-breather when @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath110 , the excitation of this normal mode will quickly spread into a packet , but stay localized in normal mode space for all observation times ( this localization is the fpu problem ) . if @xmath111 , the long time of nonequipartition will be eventually replaced by a thermalized state .",
    "suppose we excite a low frequency normal mode for which the corresponding @xmath0-breather is delocalized , and @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath110 , the normal mode will not decay at all during the observation time .",
    "the simulation will thus recover the linear dynamics of the bare modes as if the nonlinearity were absent .",
    "if @xmath111 , the normal mode will begin to decay into other modes , but there will be no intermediate state in which only a few other modes become excited ; rather the entire available mode space will be excited at once .",
    "that means that these low frequency modes will behave like linear modes for short times and fully chaotically for larger times , without any intermediate regime of exciting only a few other modes .",
    "the normal mode frequencies @xmath106 are periodic in the wave number @xmath74 .",
    "that period defines the irreducible part of the wave number space , which therefore has finite width ( for the chain it is @xmath112 ) .",
    "localization in wave number space is meaningful only when the localization length @xmath113 .",
    "thus , from our previous results we conclude that all @xmath0-breathers which are closer than some critical distance @xmath114 of the seed wave number @xmath82 from the spectrum edge delocalize . for non - zero @xmath115 @xmath116 .",
    "thus , there exists a range of @xmath82 for which the excitation of the normal mode decays and the normal mode picture may become ill - defined . the range @xmath114 is an increasing function of @xmath89 , and for some critical value @xmath89 @xmath117 , which means that normal modes do not characterize the dynamics of the system .",
    "that corresponds to the regime of strong interaction between modes . for small @xmath89",
    "this strong interaction occurs near the edges of the spectrum only .",
