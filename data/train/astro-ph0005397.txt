    "it is 20 years since butcher & oemler ( 1978 ; 1984 , hereafter bo84 ) first reported their startling results on the blue galaxy fractions of distant clusters .",
    "this and subsequent photometric work suggested that the cores of distant clusters at redshift @xmath1@xmath30.2 contain large numbers of blue galaxies ( couch & newell 1984 ; lubin et al .",
    "1996 ; rakos & schombert 1995 ) , in stark contrast to the homogeneous red populations of local galaxy clusters ( eg . , bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; terlevich , bower & caldwell 2000 ) .",
    "there is an apparent contradiction between the narrow colour - magnitude ( cm ) relation of evolved galaxies in local clusters ( which indicates a long period of passive evolution ) and the blue colours of intermediate redshift galaxies ( which indicates considerable , relatively recent star formation activity ) .",
    "bower , kodama & terlevich ( 1998 , bkt98 ) , smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and balogh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have begun the process of modelling the combined dynamical and photometric evolution of clusters in order to reconstruct the galaxies formation histories .",
    "we continue these themes in this paper .",
    "bo84 s original discovery of strong cluster evolution involved only the photometric properties of galaxies .",
    "we will refer to this aspect as the ` photometric butcher - oemler effect ' .",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1992 ) and couch & sharples ( 1987 ) undertook spectroscopy initially with the motivation of confirming spectroscopically that the blue galaxies were cluster members .",
    "they discovered that many of the blue cluster galaxies , and some red ones , had spectra of a type that are rare in local galaxy samples .",
    "these galaxies ( referred to as e+a , psg , a+k",
    "/ k+a ) have anomalously strong balmer lines indicating an excess of a - stars superimposed on an k - star type spectrum .",
    "the galaxies are produced when star formation is abruptly truncated ( couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "the strongest lined examples require a burst of star formation just before the truncation ( eg . , barger et al .",
    "1996 ; poggianti & barbaro 1996 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ; couch et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we refer to the increase in the incidence of such spectra with redshift as the ` spectroscopic butcher - oemler effect '    with the advent of hst , it has become possible to study the morphologies of galaxies in the distant clusters ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ; dressler et al . 1994 ; 1997 ; couch et al . 1994 ; 1998 ) .",
    "they found that the morphological mix in these clusters also evolved with redshift , creating a third variant of the butcher - oemler effect , which we will refer to as the ` morphological bo effect ' .",
    "in particular , the fraction of s0 galaxies in the cluster cores decreases rapidly with redshift ( dressler et al .",
    "several attempts have been made to connect photometric / spectroscopic features and the morphology .",
    "dressler et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and couch et al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that most of the blue bo84 galaxies are actually normal spirals with the rest being interacting galaxies or mergers .",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) compared the spectroscopic and the morphological effects , suggesting that the time scale of the morphological transition is longer than the a - type star evolution since the post star burst galaxies ( k+a / a+k ) are observed as normal spirals rather than s0 galaxies .    in this paper ,",
    "we aim to clearly separate these three different ( but related ) evolutionary trends .",
    "we will focus on the _ photometric _ effect , returning to the questions raised by butcher & oemler s original papers .",
    "the advantage of the photometric approach is that it allows us to study large , complete samples of galaxies rather than a smaller subset of the population that is complicated by target selection and the strength of spectral features and often limited to brighter galaxies .",
    "recent studies have tended to concentrate on particular spectroscopic features to learn details about the nature of the star - burst / truncation phenomena seen in some cluster members ( barger et al .",
    "1996 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ; balogh et al . 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have made little progress on the evolution of the cluster population as a _",
    ", as galaxies accrete from field , truncate their star formation , and fade and become red towards the cm relation ridge - line . a conspicuous contradiction exits between poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) over the way star formation is suppressed in the cluster environment . while poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) require an abrupt end to star formation activity to explain the incidence of a+k / k+a spectra , balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) favor a slow decline in star formation in order to explain the radial dependence of the [ ] emission line strength .",
    "to remedy this situation , we will look at the cm diagrams of the distant clusters in more detail , examining how the whole cluster population evolves with time . _",
    "the essential idea is that we determine the statistical star formation histories of galaxies in clusters by connecting a series of cluster snapshots at different redshifts . _",
    "the process has been extensively applied to global galaxy populations ( eg . ,",
    "cosmic star formation history by madau , pozzeti & dickinson 1998 ) , but this is the first application specifically targeting cluster galaxies .",
    "we also address how the blue fraction varies with galaxy magnitude and with radius from the cluster centre .",
    "the variation with magnitude is of interest given cowie s claim of cosmic ` down - sizing ' : the progression of star formation into smaller and smaller units as the universe ages ( cowie et al . 1996 ) .",
    "clearly , the history of galaxy accretion will vary from cluster to cluster , and this will limit the degree to which we can reconstruct cluster galaxy evolution from a set of observations of different clusters .",
    "however , it is important to distinguish between the growth of the total cluster mass , which will be dominated by mergers between similar mass units , and the accretion of field galaxies .",
    "monte - carlo simulation of cluster growth ( lacey & cole , 1993 ) shows that while the sequence of mergers varies greatly between clusters , the role of accretion is more stable , and the fraction of galaxies accreted varies @xmath4 2 per cent per gyr .",
    "this is particularly the case if we base our study on x - ray selected clusters since the existence of a dense intracluster medium biases against the inclusion of clusters which are not yet dynamically relaxed ( bower et al .",
    "nevertheless , differences in cluster accretion histories can only be eliminated using a much larger sample of clusters than we have available at present .",
    "it is also important that we try to match the masses of the clusters in order to form an evolutionary sequence .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the cnoc clusters used in this study bracket that of the coma cluster (   2.1 ) . since the x - ray luminosity function evolves little over the look - back times involved ( eg . , ebelling et al .",
    "1996 ) , the clusters should be reasonably well matched in terms of their space density .",
    "possibly , we would have liked to compare with an even richer local cluster (   2.4 ) .",
    "however , although there is no such massive local cluster , current data on the richness dependence of the cm relation suggests that it would have even an tighter cm ridge - line ( and smaller blue fraction ) than that of coma ( lpez - cruz 1996 ) .",
    "our goals in this paper are two - fold .",
    "initially , we will make an accurate comparison of the distant and local clusters .",
    "in particular , we will test whether the galaxies in the distant clusters simply fade and become red after their star formation is truncated or whether an additional mechanism such as tidal stripping or harassment ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) is required to explain how the distant clusters evolve into clusters like those at the present - day .",
    "we then go on to explore the distribution of galaxies in the colour - magnitude plane , and to address the difference between clusters at different redshifts .",
    "the distribution of galaxies can be used to derive the history of galaxy accretion from the field and the way the star formation is truncated .",
    "we will show that a consistent picture emerges in which the accretion rate of cluster galaxies from the field declines smoothly with time .",
    "combined with the decline of star formation activity of field galaxies , this naturally accounts for the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in   2 , we present the sources of data used to compose the distant and local cluster cm diagrams , and outline how we correct for background and foreground galaxies . in   3",
    ", we calculate the blue galaxy fraction from the field corrected cm diagrams and discuss its dependence on magnitude and the distance from cluster centre . in   4 , we apply our stellar population models to calculate the colour change ( red - wards ) and fading of the distant cluster cm diagrams and compare with a local cluster ( coma ) . in   5 , we investigate the colour distribution of galaxies in more detail , examining how the galaxy accretion rate must evolve in time .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in ",
    "we use h@xmath5=50 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and q@xmath5=0.1 throughout this paper , which are the same parameters adopted in the original bo84 work .",
    "the age of the universe is 16.5  gyr for this parameter set .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     model ( a ) is motivated by quilis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and reflects what would happen if the diffuse hydrogen were removed from the galaxy by ram - pressure stripping while the remaining molecular gas ( typically 50  % of the total gas mass ) is consumed in a pressure induced star burst . model ( b ) mimics the decline in star formation rate expected if the action of the cluster is simply to remove the outer gas reservoir .",
    "1.0      since we consider that the cluster galaxies is accreted from the field , the distribution of @xmath7 for the cluster galaxies is taken to be the same as for the field population .",
    "this is directly estimated from the colour distribution of the real field galaxies through our treatment of star formation described in appendix  b. here we use 94 spectroscopically confirmed field galaxies between 0.3@xmath2@xmath1@xmath20.35 from the entire observed fields of the seven cnoc clusters .",
    "the estimated distribution of @xmath7 for the field galaxies can be expressed by a gaussian : @xmath9 where @xmath10=0.3 , and @xmath11=0.2 .",
    "this distribution not only gives a reasonable match to the colour distribution of the cnoc field galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field_gr ] ) , but also reproduces the so - called madau curve ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ) ; ie .",
    "the global star formation rate for field galaxies as a function of redshift at the same time ( see the long dashed curve against the long - short dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfh ] ) .",
    "when the galaxies fall into clusters , star formation ceases with either gas loss and/or a star burst as described in appendix  c. now , in order to reproduce a certain colour of a given cluster galaxy , various combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are possible for a given set of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , although @xmath7 should be larger than a certain minimum value @xmath14 which corresponds to @xmath15 .    for each possible combination of ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) , the colour changing rate @xmath16 at the cluster redshift",
    "is calculated : @xmath17 note the exception that the colour used is @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 for coma .",
    "the probability of assigning @xmath7 , @xmath21 , is inversely proportional to this rate since a galaxy with higher colour changing rate is rarer to find : @xmath22 where the normalisation @xmath23 is determined by @xmath24    the distribution of @xmath7 is thus skewed towards larger values due to the minimum cut @xmath14 and the @xmath21 term . to get the same distribution of @xmath7 in equation",
    "( d1 ) for the cluster galaxies , the probability of assigning a given @xmath7 should be corrected for these effects .",
    "the correction function @xmath25 is the sum of the individual @xmath21 term over all the cluster members : @xmath26    finally , we assign @xmath7 randomly for each cluster galaxy using the following distribution function @xmath27 : @xmath28 the truncation time , @xmath8 , is then determined by requiring the galaxy to have its observed colour at the cluster look - back time ."
