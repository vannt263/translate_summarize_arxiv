    "<S> we discuss in this paper the subleading contact interactions , or counterterms , in the @xmath0 channel of nucleon - nucleon scattering up to @xmath1 , where , already at leading order , weinberg s original power counting ( wpc ) scheme fails to fulfill renormalization group invariance due to the singular attraction of one - pion exchange . treating the subleading interactions as perturbations and using renormalization group invariance as the criterion </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate whether wpc , although missing the leading order , could prescribe correct subleading counterterms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the answer is negative and , instead , that the structure of counterterms agrees with a modified version of naive dimensional analysis . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath0 as an example , we also study the cutoffs where the subleading potential can be iterated together with the leading one .    since its proposal  @xcite and first implementation  @xcite , the effective field theory ( eft ) description of nuclear forces has enjoyed significant phenomenological successes  @xcite . based on naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) , weinberg s original power counting ( wpc ) scheme has one crucial assumption : each derivative on the lagrangian terms </S>",
    "<S> is always suppressed by the underlying scale of chiral eft , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 with @xmath4 the mass of the @xmath5 meson . due to the lack of bound states or resonances near threshold ( with the delta - isobar integrated out ) , this assumption turns out to be quite applicable in the single - nucleon sector . </S>",
    "<S> however , the nonperturbative nature of few - nucleon systems could make infrared mass scale ( @xmath6 mev)such as the pion decay constant @xmath7 mev and the pion mass @xmath8 mev  to enhance @xmath9 contact interactions relative to wpc . </S>",
    "<S> in fact many works have pointed out that wpc is inconsistent from the point of view of renormalization group ( rg ) invariance  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> renormalization is associated with ultraviolet ( uv ) momenta in the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation rather than with the uv divergence of perturbative , @xmath9 irreducible diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> one mechanism to upset wpc is the singular ( diverging at least as fast as @xmath10 ) attraction of the tensor force of one - pion exchange ( ope ) , @xmath11 at @xmath12 , in certain s , p , and d channels where ope needs full iteration : @xmath13 , @xmath0 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the singular attraction of ope requires a counterterm at leading order ( lo ) in these channels . </S>",
    "<S> however , the p or d wave counterterms are counted as subleading in wpc since they have at least two derivatives  @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the lo counterterm of , say , @xmath0 , is enhanced by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote different orders of the eft expansion by its relative correction to the lo . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is labeled by @xmath17 or @xmath18 for short , and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) by @xmath19 or @xmath20 , and so on .    </S>",
    "<S> the question remains as to how to modify wpc at subleading orders . </S>",
    "<S> the model study in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggests , referred to in the paper as modified nda ( @xmath21 ) , that in the case of the lo long - range potential being singular and attractive , the subleading counterterms are enhanced relative to nda by the same amount as the lo counterterms . as a first study , we use @xmath0 in the paper to investigate whether @xmath21 is applicable in nuclear eft . note that different approaches toward renormalization of nuclear forces are offered in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and that perturbative pion theory leads to a very different renormalization program  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the resummation of ladder diagrams in lower partial waves can be achieved by solving the ls equation , with the schematic form , @xmath22 where the potential @xmath23 consists of short - range counterterms @xmath24 and long - range pion - exchange @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the schrdinger propagator and @xmath27 is a ( sharp ) momentum cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> being singular and attractive in @xmath0 , ope demands promotion of the leading @xmath0 counterterm , @xmath28 an @xmath16 enhancement over wpc  @xcite , where @xmath29 is a common factor associated with nucleonic loops . for a comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the leading s - wave counterterms scale generically as @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> .    it will prove useful to have the short - range behavior of the lo @xmath0 wave function . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the center - of - mass momentum , the lo wave function @xmath33 can be solved for in powers of @xmath34  @xcite , up to a normalization factor , @xmath35 \\ , ,   \\label{eqn : psi0}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 with @xmath37 the nucleon axial charge , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are oscillatory functions in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 with amplitudes @xmath42 , where @xmath41 is the phase between the two independent solutions and is related to @xmath43 .    before two - pion exchanges ( tpes ) </S>",
    "<S> are accounted for , which provide @xmath20 or higher corrections to ope , there might exist a nonvanishing @xmath18 manufactured by inserting subleading contact interactions alone . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , ref .  @xcite rated the triplet p - wave subleading contact interactions as @xmath44 , a lower - order contribution than tpe .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a nonvanishing @xmath18 does not seem to be necessary . the study of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggests that the residual cutoff dependence of the renormalized lo @xmath0 amplitude is @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> had this residual cutoff dependence vanished slower than @xmath46 , our ignorance of short - range physics would have been larger than @xmath19 , that is , larger than what tpe could compensate . </S>",
    "<S> if this happened , one would have had to consider an @xmath17 correction to the lo amplitude induced by inserting a four - derivative @xmath0 counterterm , before accounting for tpe . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rather small residual cutoff dependence of the lo @xmath0 amplitude does not ask for a nonvanishing @xmath18 .    with @xmath18 vanishing , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 amplitudes , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , consist , respectively , in one insertion of @xmath47 or @xmath48 potentials , @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> since this is equivalent to first - order distorted wave expansion , one can evaluate the `` superficial '' divergence of one insertion of @xmath52 ( leading tpe ) and @xmath53 ( subleading tpe ) before any counterterm is considered , by investigating the short - distance behavior of the matrix element of @xmath54 between the lo wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> this is facilitated by the short - distance behavior of the lo wave function   and tpes , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with a radial coordinate cutoff @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> , we arrive at @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are oscillatory functions diverging slower than @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> their exact forms can be evaluated @xcite but are not crucial for our discussion .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not necessarily true that one must use two counterterms to subtract the two divergent terms in eq .   or . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , wpc prescribes only one counterterm up to @xmath61 , and with the nonperturbative treatment it did provide a good fit to partial wave analysis ( pwa ) for a moderate range of cutoffs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the counterterms prescribed by wpc , @xmath62 where we split @xmath63 into three pieces with @xmath64 determined at lo . </S>",
    "<S> this splitting reflects the fact that the value of the `` bare '' @xmath43 could be modified at each order by , e.g. , the short - range core of tpe , but the number of physical , short - range inputs is still one .    </S>",
    "<S> the other scenario is to provide an equal number of counterterms as the divergent terms in eqs .   and : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 thus , up to @xmath61 , every @xmath0 counterterm gets enhanced relative to wpc by the same amount , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly what to be expected based on @xmath21  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a few versions of tpes in the literature with slight differences in how double counting is avoided  @xcite . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> , we use the version in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , delta - less tpe expressions with dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the following low - energy constants for the @xmath67 @xmath68 seagull couplings ( gev@xmath69 ) : @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first test the prescription given by wpc  . at each order , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 is determined such that the phase shift at @xmath73 mev agrees with the nijmegen pwa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that extra cares are needed to convert the subleading @xmath74-matrix into phase shifts , as shown in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fxk - pres1 ] shows the resulting phase shifts as functions of @xmath27 at @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 mev . at @xmath47 , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory cutoff dependence becomes more evident as the energy increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the superficial divergence ; while the @xmath78 term is taken care of by @xmath79 , the amplitude of the oscillation of @xmath80 is left intact and grows as the energy increases . </S>",
    "<S> moving on to @xmath61 we find more drastic , oscillatory cutoff dependence with a visibly growing amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the factor of @xmath27 that accompanies the oscillatory @xmath81 in eq .  .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ]     with the @xmath21 counting , we need two physical inputs to determine the values of @xmath43 and @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit them to reproduce the pwa at @xmath83 and @xmath84 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the plateaus in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fxk - pres2 ] clearly show the rg invariance of the power counting , where the phase shifts are plotted as functions of @xmath27 at given @xmath85 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phs3p0-updated ] , the eft phase shifts are plotted as function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is refined by employing more pwa points ( @xmath8625 , 50 , 75 , and 100 mev ) in the fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we see that both @xmath47 and @xmath61 are in good agreement with the pwa .     </S>",

    "<S> although the perturbative treatment of wpc does not lead to cutoff independent results , the nonperturbative treatment does seem to fulfill rg invariance  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore instructive to compare the following three scenarios for @xmath0 : ( i ) the perturbative ( pert - cd ) and ( ii ) nonperturbative calculations with the modified power counting ( iter - cd ) , and ( iii ) the nonperturbative calculation with wpc ( iter - wpc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : window ] are the @xmath0 phase shifts calculated at @xmath61 with the aforementioned three schemes , where the fit of @xmath43 and @xmath82 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is performed with the pwa inputs up to @xmath73 mev . at the lower end of cutoffs ( as exemplified by @xmath89 mev ) , the three curves differ drastically from each other above @xmath90 mev , with the pert - cd curve agreeing somewhat better with the pwa . </S>",
    "<S> as the cutoff goes higher ( exemplified by @xmath91 mev ) , the difference between iter - cd and iter - wpc becomes smaller and eventually vanishes , in accordance with the finding of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this does not necessarily mean that the fitting drives @xmath92 to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the quality of the fit is not sensitive to @xmath93 when the ratio is tuned from 0 to 1 .     </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) is plotted with @xmath89 mev and ( b ) with @xmath94 mev . ]    in summary , we conclude :    * wpc does not accommodate a cutoff independent @xmath74-matrix at @xmath47 or @xmath61 when subleading potentials are treated as perturbations on top of the lo . </S>",
    "<S> * rg invariance can be achieved by the modified power counting , based on modified naive dimensional analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that @xmath95 , the lo long - range potential in the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is not crucial for @xmath21 to be applicable . </S>",
    "<S> * at @xmath96 , iter - cd , pert - cd and iter - wpc show that in a limited range of cutoffs these three approaches produce similar phase shifts for @xmath0 , a conclusion similar to that of refs .  @xcite . </S>",
