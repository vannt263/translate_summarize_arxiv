    "one of the critical ingredients to understand nuclear properties , both in the valley of stability and at the nuclear drip lines , is the pairing effect @xcite .",
    "pairing is a general term that embodies the correlation between pairs of nucleons , producing for example the well - known mass staggering in nuclear isobars .",
    "pairing is also essential to understanding the formation of two - neutron halos  @xcite . although the importance of pairing for describing nuclear phenomena is well accepted , reaction probes used to measure pairing are still poorly understood .",
    "two - nucleon transfer is the traditional probe to study pairing .",
    "the main idea is that the angular distribution for the simultaneous transfer of two nucleons depends directly on the change in angular momentum of the two nucleons from the original to the final nucleus , and therefore provides indirectly information on their relative motion .",
    "experimental studies of two - neutron transfer imply the use of a surrogate reaction .",
    "hence , the interpretation of the results become strongly dependent on the reaction mechanism , since typically the simultaneous transfer of the two nucleons is contaminated by the two - step sequential transfer .",
    "traditionally a@xmath5b or b@xmath6a reactions have been the most common tools to explore two - neutron correlations ( see for example @xcite for earlier studies and @xcite for more recent studies ) .",
    "the advantage of @xmath5 is that it allows the study of not only the ground state of b but also of a number of its excited states , accessible through energy and angular momentum matching .",
    "since the triton is a well understood nucleus , it was thought that these reactions would be easier to describe than others using heavier probes @xcite .",
    "however , missing factors of 2 or 3 in the cross section normalization ( known as the unhappiness factor @xcite ) for @xmath6 and @xmath5 have shown that a simple perturbative description , that does not take into account the intermediate deuteron state correctly has severe limitations @xcite .",
    "there are experimental drawbacks as well : ( p , t ) only permits the study of the ground - state of the original nucleus considered , and @xmath5 requires handling of tritium radioactivity , which is challenging in most laboratories .",
    "other two - neutron transfer probes have been considered .",
    "the next simplest case after @xmath5 would be the ( @xmath7he,@xmath8he ) reaction involving the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath7he .",
    "the structure of @xmath7he makes it a very attractive candidate for two - neutron transfer reactions , because of its borromean nature and its very low two - neutron separation energy ( @xmath9 mev ) .",
    "indeed , chatterjee _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recently observed in @xmath7he on @xmath10cu at 23  mev a large dominance of the two - neutron over one - neutron transfer cross - section and interpreted this in terms of the unique features of the @xmath7he wavefunction . at present , @xmath1he is the best understood two - neutron halo nucleus , with a very significant component where the halo neutrons are spatially correlated ( the so - called `` di - neutron '' component ) and an equally important component where the two halo neutrons are anti - correlated ( the so - called `` cigar '' component ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . given the comparatively small @xmath1he two - neutron separation energy with respect to the one of the triton ( @xmath11 mev ) , the two - neutron transfer reaction ( @xmath7he,@xmath8he ) provides not only a higher q - value overall than its @xmath5 counterpart allowing for higher excited states to be populated , but also a more favorable q - value matching condition for a given two - neutron transfer reaction .",
    "it has even been suggested by fortunato _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that this higher q - value provides relatively large cross sections to study giant pairing vibrations in heavy - ions",
    ". it also provides a different angular momentum matching condition , given that the two active neutrons can exist in a relative p - state as opposed to the situation in the triton .",
    "in addition to these two important differences , the borromean nature of @xmath1he @xcite implies that the sequential transfer can only happen through the continuum states of @xmath12he and is likely to leave a softer imprint in the distributions than the sequential process in @xmath5 through the deuteron bound state .",
    "experimentally , the major drawback lies in the fact that @xmath7he is unstable ( t@xmath13=807 ms ) and therefore the reaction can only be studied using targets made of stable or long - lived isotopes .",
    "theoretically , one difficulty arises from the existence of unbound excited states in @xmath7he , the first one ( 2@xmath14 ) at 1.8 mev . with this in mind , what is needed to explore ( @xmath7he,@xmath8he ) is a test - case , where the final state is well understood , such that the focus can be on the reaction mechanism .    given the interest in the halo structure of @xmath1he @xcite , there have been many measurements involving the ( @xmath7he,@xmath8he ) vertex .",
    "the measurements of the p(@xmath7he,@xmath8he)t at 151 mev @xcite resulted in difficulties in the analysis due to the strong interference of the small @xmath15 component in the @xmath1he wave function .",
    "there were also two measurements on @xmath2he(@xmath7he,@xmath8he)@xmath1he , one at e@xmath16 mev @xcite and the other at e@xmath17 mev @xcite . in this reaction",
    ", the transfer channel corresponds to the exchange of the elastic channel , reducing the number of effective interactions necessary to describe the process , but introducing yet another complication , that of appropriate symmetrization . and",
    "while ref  @xcite clearly demonstrated a preference for two - neutron over one - neutron transfer , the actual mechanism for the two - neutron transfer was simply assumed to be one - step arising from the di - neutron configuration of the @xmath7he wavefunction .",
    "our test - case is the reaction @xmath0c(@xmath7he,@xmath8he)@xmath4c , a reaction that populates well - known states in @xmath4c .",
    "possible intermediate states in @xmath18c in the sequential transfer are also well known .",
    "if we thus assume that our present knowledge of @xmath1he is complete , we can focus on the reaction mechanism .",
    "@xmath0c(@xmath7he,@xmath8he)@xmath4c was first performed at e=5.9 mev @xcite and populated the ground state and the first @xmath19 and @xmath20 states in @xmath4c .",
    "following that measurement , the reaction was remeasured at 18 mev @xcite , populating strongly the @xmath21 mev @xmath22 state in @xmath4c . at the lowest beam energy ,",
    "the transfer can not be treated perturbatively , resulting in an intricate mechanism for the process @xcite , in @xcite a reasonable description of the reaction is provided with the simple one - step di - neutron model .    in this work ,",
    "we present new results from the measurement of @xmath0c(@xmath7he,@xmath8he)@xmath4c at @xmath23 mev and discuss in detail the reaction mechanisms taking into account not only one - step but also two - step ( through intermediate @xmath18c states ) processes .",

    "the results obtained with the di - neutron model are shown in figures [ f : transfer ] and [ f : milmod ] by the dot - dashed line . applying a renormalization of @xmath105 to the 30 mev di - neutron cross section ( not shown in the fig .",
    "[ f : transfer ] ) produces a distribution that resembles the respective data .",

    "also , a coupled channel analysis of the 18 mev data @xcite including elastic , inelastic and transfer channels , again based on the simple di - neutron model , produces cross sections in agreement with the data .",
    "however , the agreement of the di - neutron model with the 18 mev data is deceptive . the fact that our simultaneous transfer predictions ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ f : transfer ] and [ f : milmod ] ) are far from the di - neutron predictions ( dot - dashed lines ) stress the need for the inclusion of the correct three - body description of the projectile since it introduces important dynamics in the process .",
    "while it is reassuring that the best reaction model is able to describe our transfer data at 30 mev , the factor of 2 mismatch between our best reaction model and the data at 18 mev , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : milmod ] calls for further investigation . ideally , as a first step",

    "in summary , the elastic scattering of @xmath1he on @xmath0c at 30 mev was measured and an angular distribution extracted .",
    "inelastic scattering data was also extracted and analyzed including the quadrupole deformation of @xmath0c .",
    "qualitative agreement to the data was found , when accounting for full coupling of the ground state and first excited state of @xmath0c .",
    "data for the two - neutron transfer angular distribution to the @xmath22 8.32 mev state in @xmath4c was observed and analyzed , including the simultaneous and the sequential contributions .",
    "a realistic three - body structure for @xmath1he was taken into account and state - of - the - art shell model predictions were used for the structure of the carbon isotopes .",
    "overall , the reaction model describes the new data without invoking a normalization constant .",
    "it was observed that the simultaneous transfer is the dominant reaction mechanism , yet the strong interplay between the intermediate states of @xmath18c have non - negligible contributions to the final results .",
    "this implies that adding the two - step process is required in order to better account for the overall reaction mechanism .",
    "discrepancies observed when adopting the current model to data at 18 mev show that further theoretical work is required for a general and reliable approach to ( @xmath1he,@xmath2he ) reactions .",
    "even with the simultaneous experimental measurement of the elastic scattering , we find that the largest source of uncertainties in the calculation lies in the determination of the optical model potentials .",
    "our sensitivity studies suggest that measurements of the elastic scattering all the way to @xmath106 could reduce these uncertainties .",
    "this , however , presents some serious experimental challenges .    concerning the reaction theory for the two - neutron transfer , this calls for further developments .",
    "future work should include the study of the effects of the continuum ( e.g. the @xmath74 @xmath1he resonance , the @xmath12he states , etc ) in the reaction dynamics .",
    "the strong sensitivity to the choice of optical potential parameters may be greatly reduced , if these are derived microscopically .",
    "finally , comparisons to multiple final bound states of @xmath4c , such as the first @xmath73 and @xmath74 states , would allow a more thorough understanding of the spin dependencies of one - step and two - step processes .",
