    "herbig ae / be stars ( hereafter haebes ; herbig , 1960 ) form a class of massive , young stars with high luminosities ( @xmath2 ) and with a strong infrared ( ir ) excess due to circumstellar dust ( waters and waelkens , 1998 ) . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of haebes",
    "can be explained by circumstellar envelopes with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6  @xmath0 m ; brooke et al . , 1993 ; meeus et al . ,",
    "2001 ) , and by dust emission from amorphous or crystalline silicate bands ( @xmath7  @xmath0 m ) or molecular and atomic transitions .",
    "accretion disks and outflows in the less massive classical t tau stars ( ctts ) are intimately connected , thus the presence of outflows in some haebes suggests that disks could be present as well ( e.g. , corcoran and ray , 1998a ) .",
    "corcoran and ray ( 1998b ) also found that the wind mass - loss rate correlates with the ir excess over @xmath8 orders of magnitude in luminosity and from @xmath9 to @xmath10 when using both ctts and haebes .",
    "outflows in haebes are @xmath11 times faster ( @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 ) than in ctts , but generally show similar collimation ( @xmath14 ) , although the fraction of poorly collimated outflows in haebes ( @xmath15 ) is larger ( e.g. , mundt and ray , 1994 ) .",
    "complex shocks occur at the interface between the jet and the molecular material ( draine , 1980 ) , heating up the gas which in turn cools down radiatively .",
    "this gas is detected as herbig - haro objects ( hh ) in excited lines in the optical , in the near - ir ( e.g. , @xmath16 ro - vibrational lines around 2  @xmath0 m ) , and in the mid - ir ( [ o  i ] 63  @xmath0 m ; nisini et al . , 1997 ; liseau et al . , 1997 ; molinari et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the herbig be star r mon ( @xmath17  pc ) is associated with ngc 2261 , a reflection nebula that gradually faints with increasing wavelength ( close et al . , 1997 ) . a bipolar outflow and a high - velocity jet ( @xmath18  km  s@xmath13 ) pointing toward the nearby hh  39 knots ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) were detected ( cant et al . , 1981 ; brugel et al . , 1984 ; movsessian et al",
    ". , 2002 ) .",
    "evidence for a circumstellar disk is substantiated as well ( e.g. , beckwith et al . , 1986 ; fuente et al . , 2003 ; fuente et al . ,",
    "a faint ctts companion at a separation of @xmath21 and with @xmath22 flux of 34  mjy is mentioned by close et al .",

    "the hh  39 cluster of knots covers an area about @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hh39 ] ; jones and herbig , 1982 ; walsh and malin , 1985 ) , and the northernmost knot , knot a , is believed to be the working surface of the jet ( schwartz and schultz , 1992 ) .",
    "near - ir spectra of r mon exist mostly in the @xmath24  @xmath0 m range with low ( @xmath25 ) spectral power ( kelly et al . , 1994 ; reipurth and aspin , 1997 ; porter et al . , 1998 ) . _ iso _ neither observed r mon nor hh  39 .",
    "the _ iras _ lrs spectrum ( @xmath26  @xmath0 m ) of r mon is classified as an `` unusual spectrum showing a flat continuum with unusual features '' ( chen et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "aspin et al . ( 1988 ) and yamashita et al . (",
    "1989 ) claimed to detect an extended emission eastward of r mon , but it remained undetected by close et al .",

    "we have obtained 4.2  hrs of _ spitzer _ time to study the r mon / hh  39 system .",
    "our program ( pid 20034 ) uses _ all _ instruments : irac and mips images of hh  39 ; irac images of r mon and its jets ; irs spectra of r mon , its jets , and several of the hh  39 knots ; and mips sed of r mon .",

    "knots d , g , c , and e are clearly detected in all irac bands , and knot h is tentatively detected .",
    "a diffuse emission is observed near the position of knot a in irac1 only .",
    "the feature could be due to h@xmath1 lines or 3.3  @xmath0 m pah .",
    "since this feature is not detected in irac2 , this is a ",
    "free band , it is very likely that pahs contribute to the diffuse emission near knot a. h@xmath1 lines , on the other hand , most likely contribute to the emission in knots d , g , c , and e. supporting evidence comes from a faint 00 s(1 ) rotational h@xmath1 line detected in the irs spectra at 17.03  @xmath0 m of the bright knots ( @xmath29  w  cm@xmath28 ) .",
    "in contrast , irs spectra of knots a+a@xmath31 do not show evidence of h@xmath1 line emission in excess of the nearby continuum .",
    "note that faint [ ne ii ] emission at 12.81  @xmath0 m is measured in the bright knots and at the position of knots a+a@xmath31 ( of the order of @xmath32  w  cm@xmath28 ) . at 8  @xmath0 m ,",
    "the bright knots are barely visible on top of a diffuse emission that sweeps in through the knots .",
    "this extended emission is likely of due to pahs ( 7.7  @xmath0 m ) and is also seen in the dust continuum 24  @xmath0 m mips image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hh39_mips ] and [ fig : hh39_irac_mips ] ) .",

    "nevertheless faint hh 39 knots are also detected at 24  @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hh39_irac_mips ] ) , but there is no clear evidence of the knots in the 70  @xmath0 m image . on the other hand , it should be reminded that the fwhm prf at 70  @xmath0 m is 18@xmath36 , i.e. , about the distance from knot a to the group of knots ( g , d , e , c , h ) .",
    "therefore , since the mips 70  @xmath0 m image does not , apparently , observe the same diffuse emission as at 24  @xmath0 m or 8  @xmath0 m , it is possible that the faint emission at the position of the cluster of knots is in fact partially due to [ o i ] 63  @xmath0 m line emission from the knots .",
    "emission from the upper part of ngc 2261 is also detected in mips at 24  @xmath0 m .",
    "the bright emission sw of hh  39 is the ir source iras 06362 + 0853 .",
    "there is no evidence for diffuse emission in 2mass around iras 06362 + 0853 , suggesting that it is of interstellar cirrus nature .",
    "surface flux densities at 24  @xmath0 m are around 42  mjy  sr@xmath13 for the  blue \" color regions and go up to 43.1  mjy  sr@xmath13 across hh  39 .",
    "peak surface flux densities for iras 06362 + 0853 are about 44.4  mjy  sr@xmath13 and 46.7  mjy  sr@xmath13 for the dust emission of ngc 2261 . at 70  @xmath0 m ,",

    "[ fig : rmon_irac ] shows the irac images of the herbig be star r mon and its immediate surroundings .",
    "note that irac2 could not be used , even in sub - array mode , due to r mon s brightness at 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the main goal of these observations was to detect any faint emission from the jets ( ns direction ) or from the circumstellar disk ( ew direction ) .",
    "in particular , we aimed to determine whether a faint eastward extended emission feature detected by aspin et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and yamashita et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , but undetected by close et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , could indeed be detected with the highly sensitive irac detectors .",
    "the total ( zodi and cirrus ) background flux densities are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42  mjy  sr@xmath13 ( based on spot ) . however , the brightness of r mon is such that the prf illuminates the full sub - array detector .",
    "aperture photometry ( with a radius of 10 pixels = @xmath43 , requiring no aperture correction ) , the total flux densities for r mon are @xmath44  jy , @xmath45  jy , and @xmath46  jy in irac 1 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the estimated background fluxes over a circle of 10 pixel radius are negligible ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49  jy ) compared to r mon s brightness and the rms uncertainties .",
    "note that the above fluxes include any contribution from r mon b , separated from r mon by 0.7@xmath36 ( close et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "however , in comparison with r mon , the companion is expected to contribute negligibly ( @xmath50  jy in jhk@xmath51 ; close et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the next step will be to subtract the prf of r mon to possibly detect emission from the disk and the jets .",
    "we will need to create irac sub - array prfs from sub - array data of stars observed , e.g. , in the feps program .",
