    "a significant fraction of extrasolar planets that have so far been discovered are known to have large orbital eccentricities . in particular , radial - velocity surveys have shown that giant planets far enough from their host stars not to suffer strong tidal circularization have eccentricities spanning the whole range from zero to near - unity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite confirmed that this feature was still present in the transit survey obtained with the _ kepler _ mission , and argued that the mean eccentricity increases with planet size , although @xcite cautioned that uncertainties in the measurement of stellar radii in the _ kepler _ sample can affect this result .",
    "theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems have yet to explain this wide distribution of eccentricities .",
    "it is likely that mutual gravitational interactions between planets in a gas - free environment can cause their eccentricities to grow to near - unity values .",
    "this can be the result of a violent scattering @xcite or dynamical relaxation @xcite of a large population of planets .",
    "kozai - lidov oscillations , caused by a stellar companion @xcite , a planet @xcite , or a disc @xcite , can also pump up eccentricities . finally , chaotic diffusion of angular momentum deficit can increase eccentricities and inclinations over very long timescales , a process known as secular chaos @xcite .",
    "however , the initial conditions required to trigger these mechanisms often require the planets to have a certain amount of eccentricity to start with . it is unclear whether this amount is realistic or not , as it is currently difficult to predict planetary eccentricities at the beginning of the gas - free stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "another mechanism by which planets could gain eccentricities is their gravitational interaction with the protoplanetary disc in which they formed , in particular through mean - motion resonances between the planet and the disc .",
    "since the resonant interactions involve an exchange of energy and angular momentum between the planet and disc , as well as a dissipative loss of energy from the system , they can affect the orbital eccentricities of both the planet and the disc .",
    "it is now widely accepted that low - mass planets with small eccentricities that are unable to open a gap in a circular disc are expected to experience a relatively rapid eccentricity damping .",
    "@xcite showed that material orbiting at the same radius as the planet exerts a strong torque via coorbital resonances .",
    "this torque overcomes that of the non - coorbital resonances discussed by @xcite and results in eccentricity damping .",
    "this result holds as long as the surface density in the coorbital region is not strongly depleted .",
    "a refined analytical treatment of this problem was carried out by @xcite , and a similar result was obtained semi - analytically by @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of eccentric low - mass planets embedded in 2d and 3d discs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have confirmed these findings .",
    "one the other hand , @xcite considered a satellite that is massive enough to open a gap in a circular disc ( the same applies to gap - opening giant planets in protoplanetary discs ) , and showed that eccentric lindblad resonances ( elrs ) act to increase the eccentricity of the satellite , while the net effect of eccentric corotation resonances ( ecrs ) is to decrease the eccentricity .",
    "they concluded that , to lowest order in eccentricity , ecrs dominate by a small margin , and prevent eccentricity growth .",
    "an important breakthrough was achieved by @xcite and @xcite in their study of the saturation of the corotation torque ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite noted that , unlike lindblad resonances , corotation resonances readily undergo a nonlinear saturation .",
    "thus there is a finite - amplitude instability which can occur if the eccentricity exceeds a small critical value .",
    "@xcite derived an expression for the level of saturation of the corotation torque in a three - dimensional gaseous disc .",
    "the above description makes the significant assumption that the disc remains circular .",
    "however , a general keplerian disc involves nested elliptical orbits , and the secular interaction between the planet and the disc inevitably leads them to exchange eccentricity .",
    "excitation of the eccentricity of a disc has been found to be important in various astrophysical contexts , such as in the rings of uranus @xcite , or in superhump binary stars @xcite .",
    "a more general description is therefore desirable , in which both the planet and the disc are allowed to have eccentric orbits .",
    "theories of eccentric gaseous discs have been discussed in the past by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite recently developed a local model of eccentric discs , in which they explored non - linear vertical oscillations and deduced the linear global evolution of eccentricity , and then studied the hydrodynamical instability of such discs in @xcite .",
    "away from the coorbital region , the disc ",
    "planet interaction can be regarded as twofold . first , for the long - term orbit - averaged ( secular ) interaction , an analogy with planetary dynamics can be made . in celestial mechanics ,",
    "the secular interaction between planets can be described by an eigenvalue problem , usually known as the laplace ",
    "lagrange theory @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "a reversible exchange of eccentricity occurs on long timescales ( compared to orbital periods ) , and the total angular momentum deficit ( amd , a positive - definite measure of the eccentricity of the coupled system ) of the system is conserved .",
    "( at this level of approximation , the inclinations undergo a similar , although decoupled , evolution . )",
    "a similar process can occur in disc  planet interactions , where the disc can be regarded as a continuum of rings of matter interacting with the planet , and with each other .",
    "as in the case of a planetary system , amd is conserved in gravitational secular disc  planet interactions .",
    "we remark here that for a planet on an initially eccentric orbit interacting with a circular disc , secular exchange of angular momentum would cause the eccentricity of the planet to decay at first , while that of the disc increases .",
    "the second part of the interaction occurs through mean - motion resonances , leading to an irreversible evolution in which the amd can either increase or decrease .",
    "a theory of mean - motion resonances allowing for the eccentricities and inclinations of both the satellite and the disc to vary was formulated by @xcite .",
    "previously , a linear theory of disc  planet interactions was formulated by @xcite in the case of inclination , embodying secular and resonant contributions . unlike previous work ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disc was allowed to develop a warped shape , which is likely if the planet and the disc have comparable angular momenta .",
    "the linear theory allows for a set of normal modes which can grow or decay according to the balance between resonances ( which mostly increase the amd ) and viscous dissipation of the warp ( which decreases it ) . unlike @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that , after allowing the disc to become warped , inclination growth was suppressed by viscous damping for typical estimates of viscosity and disc parameters ( although @xcite were concerned with interaction between planetary rings and moons , while @xcite were studying protoplanetary discs ) .    the results of @xcite regarding inclination highlight the fact that the secular evolution of the disc and that of the planet(s ) are strongly coupled , and should be treated together rather than separately .",
    "the same statement can be made for eccentricities : in a system consisting of a disc and one or more planets , having comparable angular momenta , eccentricity is freely exchanged between the various components on secular timescales . to address the origin of eccentricity in protoplanetary systems , it is therefore more appropriate to ask under what conditions the total amd of the coupled system , rather than the eccentricity of a planet , can grow .",
    "several numerical simulations of disc  planet interactions ( or related systems ) have investigated the possibility of eccentricity growth .",
    "@xcite found , using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , that the eccentricity of a binary star can increase through its interaction with a circumbinary disc . in this case",
    "the gap is so wide that only the 1:3 elr is present ( and no ecr ) , so that the damping argument of @xcite is not applicable .",
    "the mechanism is analogous to that operating in superhump binary stars , where the eccentricity of the circumstellar disc is excited and only the 3:1 resonance is operative .",
    "such excitation was readily observed in grid - based simulations by @xcite , with rapid growth rates . in the case of disc ",
    "planet interactions , @xcite showed that massive planets ( e.g. , those of 20 jupiter masses ) could experience eccentricity growth , with the exterior disc also becoming noticeably eccentric .",
    "@xcite found that , even if the planet is held on a fixed circular orbit , the disc can become eccentric for planets exceeding about 3 jupiter masses ( for typical disc parameters ) . without fixing the planet s orbit , @xcite found growing eccentricities for planetary masses as small as 1 jupiter mass .",
    "this extension of the work by @xcite and @xcite was made possible through the use of high - resolution two - dimensional numerical simulations over several thousand planetary orbits .",
    "in contrast with circumbinary discs , they found that the 1:3 elr was highly ineffective at pumping the eccentricity , and that the 2:4 and 3:5 elrs were the most efficient ones , with additional contributions arising from resonances located within the gap .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of eccentricity and inclination of non - gap - opening planets , and confirmed that their eccentricities ( and inclinations ) would be damped by the disc , in good agreement with the semi - analytical work by @xcite .",
    "this result was later confirmed by @xcite for various planet masses , up to 1 jupiter mass , in three - dimensional isothermal and fully radiative discs .",
    "perhaps most relevant to the present work is the study by @xcite of a hot jupiter orbiting inside the magnetospheric cavity of the star .",
    "the authors found eccentricity growth for massive planets , which would eventually lead to the destruction of the planet , and possibly explain the paucity of very massive planets on short - period orbits .",
    "we will discuss these claims in the present paper .",
    "more recently , @xcite have claimed , using sph simulations , that only very massive planets ( e.g. , those of @xmath0 jupiter masses ) embedded in discs with high surface densities could experience eccentricity growth , although their simulations were limited to a few hundred orbital periods .",
    "one the other hand , @xcite recently argued that disc  planet interactions can indeed increase the eccentricity of a jupiter - mass planet embedded in an isothermal disc .",
    "such growth is possible when the planet opens a deep gap , and only if its initial eccentricity exceeds a threshold value , similarly to what was predicted analytically by @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite argued in favour of eccentricity growth for gap - opening planets in non - barotropic discs .",
    "they showed that when stellar illumination heats the gap to a certain threshold , the corotation torque can be reduced to a point where it is not able to damp eccentricity .    in this paper",
    "we present a linear theory of eccentricity evolution in disc  planet systems .",
    "our theory is analogous to the one established for inclination by @xcite .",
    "it is also related to the work by @xcite but differs by including a new treatment of mean - motion resonances between planets and discs @xcite and a three - dimensional description of the dynamics of eccentric discs @xcite .",
    "we aim to compare our results with previous analytical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as numerical simulations such as that of @xcite .",
    "the equations describing the behaviour of eccentricity are presented in section [ sec : evo_eqs ] .",

    "the vertical variation of the radial gravitational force also makes a difference .",
    "these effects account for the last term in each of the 3d equations , as well as for the different coefficients in the adiabatic case . in eq .",

    "the self - gravity of the disc can be in treated in a secular way as a continuum version of the classical laplace ",
    "lagrange theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in appendix [ app : pertpot ] , we show that self - gravity gives rise to the following contribution : @xmath282\\pi r ' \\,{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{d}}r',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a symmetric kernel representing the strength of the gravitational interaction between slightly elliptical rings at radii @xmath27 and @xmath30 . in equation ( [ eq : esg ] )",
    "the term @xmath31 represents the contribution to the precession of the annulus at @xmath27 arising from the axisymmetric gravitational potential generated by the annulus at @xmath30 , while @xmath32 represents the forcing of the eccentricity of the first annulus by that of the second .",
    "we resolve the singularity at @xmath33 by replacing @xmath34 with a softened symmetric kernel : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a dimensionless softening parameter , @xmath37 is a laplace coefficient,@xmath38 and @xmath39 is the smaller solution ( @xmath40 ) of the quadratic equation @xmath41 the softening length is then @xmath42 , and , in the limit @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "we set @xmath36 to be the scaling factor @xmath45 which appears in the expression for the disc aspect ratio ( see the description of the disc model in section [ sec : discmodel ] ) .",
    "this gives an approximation of the averaging of the gravitational potential of the disc over its vertical extent .",
    "self - gravity is therefore an additional means of propagation of eccentricity , as it gives rise to a global coupling of eccentricity between different parts of the disc .",
    "the role of self - gravity in eccentric discs was already discussed by @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to generalize the equations to the case of a multiple - planet system .",
    "the mechanism by which angular momentum is transported in protoplanetary discs remains poorly understood .",
    "even if this is modelled as an effective shear viscosity , its influence on the eccentricity is complicated and can even lead to growth rather than decay in some circumstances @xcite . in the present",
    "we adopt a simplified model of eccentricity damping .",

    "two types of resonances need to be considered .",
    "eccentric lindblad resonances ( elrs ) correspond to locations in the disc where the perturbing frequency in the rotating frame @xmath61 matches @xmath62 , the epicyclic frequency .",

    "using a complete description of the disc  planet interactions that encompasses all the effects described above , we explore the behaviour of the precession rate and growth rate when varying different physical parameters .    in what follows ,",
    "we study only the adiabatic case , in 2d and 3d .",
    "we identify the mode in the disc with the largest growth rate , which we label `` disc mode '' in all figures .",

    "this , in turn , can help the confinement of a mode in the inner parts of the disc , with small amd , and hence a large growth rate . in this section",
    "we explore the variation of the precession and growth rate as functions of the planet mass .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramqp ] .    in the disc ,",
    "3d effects allow for the confinement of a mode , but the growth of this mode is determined by the balance between resonant effects and viscosity . for low - mass planets , viscosity prevents the resonant growth .",
    "this explains why , in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramqp ] , the growth of the eccentric mode in the 3d disc becomes possible only when @xmath84 . in 2d",
    ", the growth only happens for @xmath85 with our choice of parameters . when the mass of the planet is too low , the main contribution to the growth rate ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : intstot ] ] ) comes from the viscous term ( eq . [ [ eq : jvisc ] ] ) which prevents damping .",
    "in addition , a small planet mass prevents the confinement of a mode in 2d .",
    "only when the planet becomes sufficiently massive can the mode become significantly trapped , which in turn favours the growth . for very massive planets ,",
    "the 2d mode is trapped in the deep potential created by the planet , and can grow on a timescale similar to the 3d case .    as we have already noted in section [ sec : fiduplanet ] , the planet - dominated mode experiences a faster growth in 2d than in 3d , but its growth is overall much smaller than the growth of disc - dominated modes .    in 2d , the fastest growing disc - mode is retrograde , and we plot the absolute value of its precession rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramqp ] .",
    "the 3d disc supports a series of low - order prograde modes that are confined in the inner parts of the disc .",
    "an additional interesting feature appears in the 3d case : when @xmath86 , the fastest growing mode becomes retrograde ( and therefore is not plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramqp ] , which is in logarithmic scale ) . such modes , which we already discussed in 2d in section [ sec : fiduvr ] , are in apparent contradiction with the results of section [ sec : schrod ] , which predicted that the confined mode should be prograde . confined",
    "retrograde modes are purely a consequence of the resonant growth of eccentricity . when the planet s mass is large enough , the growth rate becomes faster than the precession rate .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a mode that grows faster in the vicinity of the planet than it propagates towards the outer parts of the disc .",
    "such 3d retrograde modes however are rather rare , and in most cases the 3d confined growing mode is progade .      one can expect that , when self - gravity is negligible , the precession and growth rates of the eccentricity of the disc do not depend on the disc mass . indeed , the evolutionary equations ( [ eq:2dadia])([eq:3diso ] ) , or equivalently the effective potentials given in equations ( [ eq : schrodiso ] ) and ( [ eq : schrodadia ] ) , are independent of the scaling factor @xmath87 that determines the total mass of the disc , provided that the contribution of the planet to the mode is negligible .    for the planet mode , since most of the amd",
    "is contained in the planet , we have @xmath88 , which is independent of @xmath87 , while all contributions to the growth rate are proportional to @xmath87 , so we expect the growth rate to scale linearly with the disc mass ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : intstot ] ) .",
    "regarding the precession rate of the planet - dominated mode , the secular contribution from the disc also scales linearly with disc mass ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : intpd ] ) . at low disc mass ,",
    "the precession rate of the planet is only weakly affected by the secular contribution from the disc .",
    "the main contribution in this regime comes from general relativity ( and other short - range forces if they were included ) , which is independent of disc mass ( see eq . [",
    "eq : intsrf ] ) .",
    "the behaviours described above can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramqd ] , where the precession and growth rates are plotted against the disc - to - star mass ratio @xmath89 .",
    "there exists a 3d disc mode that precesses progradely and independently of disc mass ( an equivalent 2d mode exists , but has a retrograde precession rate which does not appear on this logarithmic plot ) . as explained above",
    ", the precession rate of the planet mode is a combination of general relativity ( independent of the disc mass ) at low disc mass and secular effects from the disc ( proportional to the disc mass ) at high disc mass .",
    "there exists a growing eccentric mode in the disc , which grows much more rapidly in 3d than in 2d .",
    "this is mostly due to our choice of parameters : the planet is not massive enough and close enough to the inner edge of the disc to allow for the confinement of a mode in the inner part of the disc in 2d .",
    "both in 2d and 3d , the disc modes show no dependence on disc mass , as expected . the planet modes scale linearly with the disc mass , as was also expected .",
    "as discussed at the end of section [ sec : paramqp ] , there is a tendency for the 2d planet mode to contain less amd than its 3d counterpart , and therefore grow more rapidly .",
    "the total mass of the disc is not necessarily an appropriate measurement of the perturbation induced by the disc on the planet .",
    "it is the local mass of the disc near the inner edge that mostly interacts with the planet .",
    "it can be defined as @xmath90 , the amount of mass near the inner edge of the disc if its surface density was not decaying to zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramqd ] we also show this quantity for a given disc mass on the top @xmath91-axis .",
    "for the disc masses considered here , the local inner mass of the disc is lower than the mass of the planet .",
    "in addition , self - gravity is not expected to play an important role for these discs . in section [ sec :",
    "rice ] , where we compare our results with existing simulations in the literature , we will see an example where the local mass in the inner disc is larger than the mass of the planet , and how this leads to a mode switching .",
    "the theory of disc  planet interactions suggests that , once a planet enters the central cavity of the disc , it will stop migrating when the torque exerted by the lindblad resonances vanishes , as the resonances all fall into the clean gap . in this section",
    "we investigate the influence of the orbital radius of the planet on the precession and growth rates of eccentric modes .    the semi - major axis of the planet is expected to be of primary importance regarding the possibility for eccentric modes to grow in a disc . in addition to determining how many resonances are located in the disc , it plays a major role in shaping the potential well in which a mode can be confined , especially in 2d ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : schrodiso][eq : schrodadia ] ) .",
    "the precession and growth rates of the fastest growing mode are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : abgrt ] , as functions of @xmath92 .",
    "we choose this variable as it help visualizing the effect of resonances .",
    "we recall that we have chosen @xmath77 au , and our fiducial example described above has @xmath82 . in 3d ,",
    "when the planet is far enough from the disc , eccentricity evolution is dominated by viscous damping , which prevents any mode to grow .",
    "only when the planet starts getting closer to the disc can the 1:3 elr eventually overcome viscous damping and give rise to eccentricity growth .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec : fiduvr ] , the amplitude of the contribution from the 1:3 elr is rather weak , and the overall growth rate is small . as the planet gets closer to the disc s inner edge , the 2:4 elr and 3:5 elr become the major source of eccentricity growth , while the 1:2 ecr damps it .",
    "the dip in eccentricity growth seen at @xmath93 corresponds to the location where the 1:2 ecr is most effective at damping amd ( we prefer to talk about amd rather than eccentricity here , since it is the eccentricity weighted by the surface density profile that really matters for the growth of the mode ) .",
    "it might seem puzzling at first that such a growing mode exists and that ecrs are rather ineffective at damping it .",
    "we find that the resonant widths of both elrs and ecrs play a major role in this process . as we have noted in section [ sec : res ] , elrs are better modelled if their centre is shifted by one resonant width in the direction away from the planet .",
    "hence , elrs for which the nominal radius is in the cavity can actually operate quite strongly in the disc .",
    "from table [ tab : rab ] , one would expect that , if @xmath82 , only the 1:3 elr would be located deeply in the disc , with the 2:4 elr just at the edge of the disc , and all the other resonances in the cavity .",
    "however , allowing all the elrs to be shifted and to have a finite width enables for the 2:4 , 3:5 , 4:6 and possibly higher order elrs to sit in the disc .",
    "on the other hand , ecrs do not have this shift , and have a very narrow width .",
    "hence , only the 1:2 resonance can operate in the disc , and it does not provide enough damping to strongly affect the net growth rate . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : abgrt ] , only when the planet orbits at @xmath94 can the growth rate be significantly reduced .",
    "this is not surprising as it corresponds to the radius at which the 1:2 ecr starts being located inside the disc .",
    "as the planet gets closer to the disc , more and more elrs enter the disc and progressively make the 1:2 ecr ineffective , recovering the result where only elrs are taken into account .",
    "hence , even without saturation of the corotation torque , eccentric modes can grow because of eccentric lindblad resonances .    in 2d ,",
    "the growing mode appears when the planet is slightly closer to the inner edge of the disc , compared to the 3d case .",
    "as we have seen in section [ sec : schrod ] , it is much harder to trap a mode in a deep potential well in 2d than in 3d .",
    "in fact , while a 3d disc naturally supports a set of confined prograde modes , the equivalent mode in 2d can only be found when a planet is close enough to the disc ( and/or massive enough ) to allow a relative confinement of the mode near the inner edge , which in turns allows the mode to grow .",
    "we have also run a similar calculation with @xmath95 , all other parameters being equal , and we found that a growing mode in 2d only appeared for @xmath96 . reducing the planet s mass decreases the depth of the effective potential well , so that only a planet close to the inner disc can help trap a mode in 2d .",
    "the precession rate of the planet mode is always positive ( prograde mode ) and only weakly depends on the planet s semi - major axis .",
    "the disc mode has a negative precession rate in 2d ( retrograde mode ) and we plot its absolute value in fig .  [",
    "fig : abgrt ] .",
    "it precesses progadely in 3d , with a significant jump in precession rate as soon as the mode is allow to grow .",
    "these results depend on the value we adopt for the resonant width . we explore this dependence in section [ sec : paramw ] .",
    "we vary the disc aspect ratio @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : hgrt ] . how the precession and growth rates should vary with @xmath45",
    "is not obvious from section [ sec : int ] .",
    "several contributions to the precession rate are proportional to pressure and therefore to @xmath97 ; however , these integrals also depend on the mode shape , which in turn depends in a non - trivial way on @xmath45 .",
    "the aspect ratio also appears indirectly in the elr width ( see equation [ eq : rwelr ] ) .        the precession rate of a 2d disc shows that for small @xmath45 the fastest growing mode in the disc has a progade precession , which decreases as @xmath45 increases , until it becomes negative . in 2d the pressure - induced precession scales as @xmath97 , such as for thin discs ,",
    "the precession rate is dominated by the prograde contribution coming from the planet .",
    "this prograde contribution is eventually overcome by the pressure term when the disc becomes sufficiently thick , and the precession is retrograde .",
    "when @xmath45 is small , the potential well in which the mode is trapped arises mainly from the planet , with little contribution from pressure . in this regime , the growth rates in 2d and 3d are therefore similar .    at large @xmath45 , the growth rate in 2d is significantly smaller than in 3d .",
    "a similar calculation but with @xmath95 instead of 0.003 showed that the growth of a 2d mode was completely suppressed for @xmath98 .",
    "the 2d adiabatic case does not allow generally for a bound state to be supported in the inner disc .",
    "only the presence of a planet can , in some cases , deepen the potential well and allow for a trapped mode .",
    "this can be understood from the effective potential that we derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodadia ] ) . in this equation ,",
    "the last term in the effective potential @xmath99 shows the competition between the potential well of the planet and the disc aspect ratio ( where we recall that @xmath100 ) .",
    "when @xmath45 becomes large enough , it causes the term due to the planet to become ineffective , and no bound state can be supported .",
    "in the 3d case , the growth rate of the disc - dominated mode first decreases before increasing again . as in the 2d case",
    ", the decrease can be interpreted as a consequence of the weaker confinement of the mode by the planet as @xmath45 increases . however , the width of the elrs is an increasing function of @xmath45 , which in turns allows for a larger growth rate , as a larger part of the disc contributes to the growth .",
    "this explains why the growth rate slightly increases again at large @xmath45 .      from the integral relations derived in section [ sec : int ] ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : jvisc ] ) , one can expect the viscous damping of eccentricity to scale linearly with @xmath52 .",
    "we have set up a calculation in which @xmath52 varies from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , not shown here .",
    "we find that the scaling is indeed linear .",
    "it is important to remember that we are using an effective bulk viscosity in this paper , representing whichever thermal or mechanical processes ( apart from resonant effects ) damp the eccentricity .",
    "while it provides a convenient formulation of eccentricity damping in a linear theory , it does not necessarily represent the effective shear viscosity that is driving accretion . in any case",
    "our results indicate that the bulk viscosity is not strong enough to oppose the resonant growth of eccentricity . only in the case where the 1:3 elr is the only resonance in the disc",
    "can viscosity compete with it ( and possibly suppress the growth rate ) .    in the case where the planet was orbiting in a gap instead of a cavity",
    ", viscosity would presumably play an important role in setting the gap s shape , and therefore in the surface density profile .",
    "it is not the case here , since we consider a planet in a cavity , whose origin is supposed to be the truncation of the disc by the stellar magnetosphere .      in section [ sec : res ]",
    "we have allowed the resonances to spread over a few rings by giving them a finite width . as discussed in section [ sec : paramap ] , it is the resonant width of elrs that allows for a large number of elrs to sit in the disc and contribute positively to the growth rate . however , there are some uncertainties on the exact value of the width , for both elrs and ecrs . estimating the influence of the resonant width",
    "is made difficult by the parametrization we used in section [ sec : res ] ( see equations [ eq : rwelr ] and [ eq : rwecr ] ) : each resonant width depends on the wavenumber @xmath103 , and the elrs width decreases with increasing @xmath103 , while it increases for ecrs .    in order to estimate how the growth rates might be affected by the resonant width , we adopt the following parametrization for elrs : @xmath104 and we vary @xmath105 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : rw1em6 ] , we show the growth rates for @xmath106 . for ecrs , we have varied the value of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rwecr ] ) from @xmath107 to @xmath108 and checked that it has no significant effect on the growth rate , as it is always so narrow that only the 1:2 ecr lies in the disc .",
    "we do not show the effect of varying the ecr width here , as the plots would be similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : rw1em6 ] . as the width of elrs increases , a larger part of the disc contributes to the growth of eccentricity , while the precession rates remain unaffected .",
    "although table [ tab : rab ] suggests that resonances with higher @xmath109 should be stronger , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "indeed , these resonances lie close to the planet , and according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rwelr ] ) , their width decreases as @xmath109 increase , and they are not broad enough to affect the disc . in addition , we recall that we have applied a cutoff so that resonances with @xmath110 are not included .        note that in section [ sec : res ] , we have derived the resonant width for elrs from a dispersion relation . in principle",
    ", this dispersion relation is modified when self - gravity is included .",
    "we find that the resonant width is now approximately given by the solution of the equation @xmath111 the additional term due to self - gravity will be zero when @xmath112 ( i.e. , when the resonant radius is not in the disc ) .",
    "in addition , when local disc mass at the resonant location @xmath113 is small , the addition of this new term brings a negligible modification to the resonant width , and can be ignored . note that we have neglected the subtle effect caused by the shifting of the resonance location away from the nominal resonant radius @xmath114 .",
    "this effect does not change the general conclusion that the effect of self - gravity on the resonant width is negligible .",
    "@xcite suggested that the paucity of hot jupiters could be caused by their interactions with the inner disc as they orbit in the stellar magnetospheric cavity .",
    "they found that , for a wide range of parameters , eccentricity can grow and eventually lead to collision with the star . in order to speed up their calculations",
    ", they increased the mass of the disc , arguing that it would simply change the timescale on which the eccentricity grows , and that everything can be rescaled linearly .",
    "they choose a surface density of @xmath108 in their units , which corresponds to @xmath115 times the expected value for such a disc .",
    "we set up a calculation similar to theirs , of a 2d locally isothermal disc with @xmath116 ( but we keep the two taper functions which cause @xmath22 to be zero at each edge ) .",
    "we take @xmath79 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath78 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we let the mass of the disc vary to cover the range from both physical values to the unrealistic ( yet convenient ) values of @xcite .",
    "the calculation does not include self - gravity or relativistic precession .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rice ] we plot the growth rates of the disc - dominated and planet - dominated modes , as a function of the mass of the disc @xmath89 , and as function of the more meaningful quantity , the local disc mass near the planet @xmath90 .",
    "since in this calculation @xmath118 , it also gives a direct measure of @xmath87 .",
    "note that for a better comparison with the results of @xcite , we give here the growth rate divided by the orbital period at @xmath121 .    for @xmath122 ,",
    "the growth rate is about @xmath123 orbits at @xmath124 , a value 10 times larger than what was found by @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy could arise from the different boundary conditions at the inner radius in the two calculations ( an outflow in @xcite and a free edge in our calculation ) .",
    "it is also possible that a 5 jupiter - mass planet at @xmath119 experiences inward migration .",
    "we have repeated the calculation with a 1 jupiter mass planet , which shows no migration in @xcite , but still find a higher growth rate than the authors ( although the growth rate for a 1 jupiter mass planet is only poorly constrained in their work ) .",
    "the scaling of growth rate with disc mass is linear for a wide range of masses , as claimed by the authors .",
    "however , for a disc with real physically motivated parameters , @xmath87 would be in the range of @xmath125 in the units used for this calculation .",
    "at this point the growth rate of the planet is lower than the growth rate of eccentricity in the disc by 5 order of magnitudes .",
    "therefore , in a real disc  planet system of this kind , one expects the eccentricity to grow much more rapidly in the disc - dominated mode than in the planet - dominated mode . here",
    "our linear model fails to predict what would happen to the coupled system in the limit of large eccentricities .",
    "presumably the disc mode will eventually undergo a non - linear saturation .",
    "one could speculate that , as the disc possesses a large reservoir of amd , it could slowly and chaotically diffuse it in the planet , therefore exciting its eccentricity in a process similar to secular chaos in planetary systems @xcite . if the chaotic behaviour finds its origin in the overlapping of two secular resonances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may be necessary to invoke the presence of two different eccentric modes in the disc , or additional planets .",
    "however it is possible that the timescale of such non - linear interaction might be longer than the disc lifetime .",
    "finally , we remark that the fastest growing mode in the system switches from being a disc - dominated mode to a planet - dominated mode when the local mass in the disc is of the order of the mass of the planet . in the regime where the two masses are nearly equal",
    ", there exists a strong coupling between the planet and the disc , where they share an almost equal amount of amd .",
    "away from this mode transition region , the scaling of mode with growth rate is roughly linear .",
    "-axis represents the disc - to - star mass ratio @xmath89 , and the equivalent local disc mass near the planet @xmath90 is represented on the top axis .",
    "the cross shows the growth rate of the planet s eccentricity as found by @xcite . ]      our disc model described in section [ sec : discmodel ] is based on a strong assumption regarding the opacity in the inner parts of the disc .",
    "we have conducted a series of runs in which the disc is described using an @xmath50-disc model for which the surface density and aspect ratio read @xmath126 and @xmath127 such a model implies a slight flaring of the disc with radius .",
    "we found that the overall results described in this paper remain unchanged with this description .",
    "a mode can still be trapped in the inner part of the disc , which grows on the same timescale , and shares the same properties regarding the difference between 2d and 3d models .",
    "we have chosen @xmath128 in the adiabatic case , but checked that results remain similar for other values ( e.g. , @xmath129 ) .",
    "non - adiabatic effects could in principle affect the eccentricity growth or decay , but are beyond the scope of this paper .    finally , the lowest - order mode is fairly independent of the outer radius @xmath130 , since it decays rapidly with radius .",
    "higher - order trapped prograde modes are expected to decay to zero at large radii , provided the disc s outer radius is large enough , and should be independent of @xmath130 as @xmath131 .",
    "however they usually contain more amd and thus grow less rapidly than the lowest - order confined mode .",
    "global retrograde modes will depend on our choice of @xmath130 .",
    "in this paper we have formulated a system of linear equations governing the evolution of small eccentricities in systems consisting of one or more planet coupled to a gaseous disc through secular and resonant interactions .",
    "we have applied this formalism to the problem of a planet orbiting in the cavity of a protoplanetary disc , under the influence of various physical effects .",
    "the inclusion of 3d effects allows for the existence of an eccentric mode trapped in the inner parts of the disc .",
    "the existence of this mode is very robust over a large range of parameters .",
    "the distribution of amd in this mode allows for a rapid growth rate , compared with 2d models . for a wide range of disc and planet parameters",
    ", an eccentric mode can grow in the disc on a timescale smaller than the disc s lifetime , although usually beyond the scope of current direct numerical simulations of disc  planet systems .",
    "we find that allowing for a finite resonant width and shifting the resonance away from its nominal radius leads to several elrs operating in the disc .",
    "it is mostly the 2:4 and 3:5 elrs that dominate the growth rate , with a small contribution from the 4:6 .",
    "the 1:3 elr is found to have little impact on the growth rate , because of its small amplitude .",
    "the only ecr that significantly contributes to the damping of eccentricity is the 1:2 . other ecrs might be present in the disc if the planet orbits closer to the inner edge , but we find that eccentricity readily grows nonetheless , because of the presence of several elrs .",
    "this suggests that , even when the corotation resonances are not saturated , eccentricity can grow even for jupiter - mass planets . if such growth was not observed in some numerical simulations , it is most likely because it occurs on ( at least ) thousands of orbital periods of the planet .",
    "in addition , growth in the disc occurs more rapidly than in the planet , and it is not clear whether the disc s eccentricity will undergo a nonlinear saturation , and how would it affect the planet .",
    "we have compared our results with those of @xcite .",
    "for the same unrealistically massive disc , we also find that an eccentric mode can grow , which is dominated by the planet .",
    "@xcite argued that the growth rates could be scaled down linearly with the disc mass , and that massive planets could therefore experience eccentricity growth within the disc lifetime .",
    "however we caution that when scaling down the system , one enters the regime where the growth of eccentricity is dominated by a disc mode whose growth is much more rapid than the planet - dominated mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rice ] ) .",
    "it is not clear what the outcome of disc  planet interactions could be for a system with an eccentric disc .    in this paper",
    "we have not considered planets orbiting in a gap , such as that created by massive planets undergoing type - ii migration .",
    "this is because the gap profile is not easy to model in such case , and should evolve in time as the planet migrates .",
    "in addition , the planet is supposed to undergo type - ii migration on a timescale that can be comparable to the growth rate of eccentricity .",
    "the assumption of a constant semi - major axis that is made here may no longer be a good approximation , and the contribution from the inner and outer discs will change as the planet comes closer to the star .",
    "it remains to be understood how , as the disc  planet system evolves in time , amd is redistributed between the two components . in the case where the disc contains most of the amd , it is possible that , as the it becomes more and more depleted , amd is given to the planet , allowing its eccentricity to grow .",
    "we remark that the same mechanism could potentially allow for inclination growth as well .",
    "this mechanism has important consequences , as it dictates the orbital architecture of the planetary systems at the beginning of the gas - free stage of planetary evolution .",
