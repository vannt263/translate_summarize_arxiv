    "therefore , the presently available observational results are strongly biased since they were focused on brighter and younger objects .    in this work , we derived physical parameters and chemical abundances for 8 old and faint bulge pne , making use of the size and optical quality of the 4.1 m soar telescope located at chile .",
    "these pne were observed with the goodman spectrograph using a 300 l / mm grating , which covers all the optical domain .",
    "all observed pne have high extinction with @xmath1 and low surface brightness .",
    "they are located in the direction of the galactic bulge , close to the galactic center . the observed sample",

    "triangles and stars represent the data from this work , and filled circles the data from cavichia et al .",

    "since pne with high abundances of he and n are originated from massive stars , we expected that the pne of our sample are originated from lower mass and , hence , older stars if compared with our previous work .",
    "the results from the chemical evolution model are shown in figure [ grad ] .",
    "the model with radial gas outflows predict lower abundances in the inner region of the galaxy and higher abundances in the outer region , when compared with the standard model from md .",
    "these results are in agreement with the observational data for the disk from stanghellini & haywood ( @xcite ) , hereafter sh , and with the observational data from the present work .        these results may have a significant impact on galactic evolution theories , providing a much more accurate view of the abundance distribution of bulge pne , and therefore producing more reliable constraints for the modeling of intermediate mass stars evolution as well as the chemical evolution of the galactic disk and bulge ."
