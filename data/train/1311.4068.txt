    "in economics  discounting \" refers to weighting the future relative to the present @xcite .",
    "the choice of a discounting function has enormous consequences for long run environmental planning @xcite .",
    "for example , in a highly influential report on climate change commissioned by the uk government , stern @xcite uses a discounting rate of @xmath0 , which on a 100 year horizon implies a present value of @xmath1 ( meaning the future is worth @xmath1 as much as the present ) . in contrast , nordhaus @xcite argues for a discount rate of @xmath2 , which implies a present value of @xmath3 , and at other times @xcite has advocated rates as high as @xmath4 , which implies a present value of @xmath5 .",
    "the choice of discount rate is perhaps the biggest factor influencing the debate on the urgency of the response to global warming .",
    "stern has been widely criticized for using such a low rate @xcite .",
    "this issue is likely to surface again with the upcoming calderon report in july 2014 .",
    "a simple argument to motivate discounting is based on opportunity cost . under a constant , continuously compounded rate of interest @xmath6",
    ", a dollar invested today will yield @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , so an environmental problem that costs @xmath9 to fix at time @xmath8 is equivalent to an investment of @xmath10 now .",
    "economists present a variety of reasons for discounting , including impatience , economic growth , and declining marginal utility ; these are embedded in the ramsey formula , which forms the basis for the standard approaches to discounting @xcite . here we adopt the net present value approach , which treats the real interest rate as the measure of the trade - off between consumption today and consumption next year , without delving into the factors influencing the real interest rate .",
    "we estimate the stochastic real interest rate process using historical data @xcite .",
    "it is often argued that , based on past trends in economic growth , future technologies will be so powerful compared with present technologies that it is more cost - effective to encourage economic growth , or to solve other problems such as aids or malaria , than it is to take action against global warming now @xcite .",
    "analyses supporting this conclusion typically study discounting by working with an interest rate that is fixed over time , ignoring fluctuations about the average .",
    "this is mathematically convenient , but it is also dangerous : in this problem , as in many others , fluctuations play a decisive role .",
    "a proper analysis takes fluctuations in the real interest rate , caused partly by fluctuations in growth , into account .",
    "when the real interest rate @xmath11 varies the discounting function becomes @xmath12 , \\label{d}\\ ] ] where the expectation @xmath13 $ ] is an average over all possible interest rate paths .",
    "the fact that this is an average of exponentials , and not an exponential of an average , implies that the paths with the lowest interest rates dominate , and in general lowers @xmath14 .",
    "this has been shown in several ways .",
    "early papers analyzed an extreme case in which the annual real rate is unknown today , but starting tomorrow will be fixed forever at one of a finite number of values @xcite .",
    "more recent papers simulate stochastic interest rate processes out to some horizon , leaving aside the asymptotic behavior of real rates @xcite .",
    "the presence of fluctuations can dramatically alter the functional form of the discounting function .",
    "if interest rates follow a geometric random walk , for example , the discounting function asymptotically decays as a power law of the form @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the exponential function , this is not integrable on @xmath16 , underscoring how important the effect of persistent fluctuations can be .",
    "to understand how discounting depends on the random process used to characterize interest rates , we have studied three different models which appear ubiquitously in the literature @xcite using both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the models are : the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process @xcite , the feller process @xcite and the log - normal @xcite process . in two of them",
    "( feller and log - normal ) rates can not take negative values while in the ou model @xmath11 can be either positive or negative . the analytical results which will be presented elsewhere are summarized in table [ tab1 ] where we see that the discounting behavior depends sensitively on the choice of model and parameters .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus the long - run interest rate @xmath17 is always lower than the average interest rate @xmath18 , by an amount that depends on the noise parameter @xmath19 and the reversion parameter @xmath20 . from equations ( [ stdv ] ) and ( [ r_inf ] )",
    "it is evident that for any given mean interest rate @xmath18 , by varying @xmath19 and @xmath20 the long - run discount rate @xmath17 can take any desired value , including negative values .",
    "furthermore , holding @xmath18 and @xmath17 fixed , the standard deviation @xmath21 can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this implies that the probability that @xmath22 can be made arbitrarily small , even when @xmath23 ( see appendix ) .",
    "note that the long run distribution @xmath24 does not determine @xmath17 by itself ; on the contrary , any @xmath25 is consistent with it . by increasing the persistence parameter @xmath26 while holding the long run distribution @xmath27 constant",
    "it is possible to lower @xmath17 to any desired level .    to summarize ,",
    "the long - run discounting rate can be much lower than the mean , and indeed can correspond to low interest rates that are rarely observed .",
    "this dramatically illustrates the folly of assuming that the average real interest rate is the correct long - run discount rate .        up to a rescaling of time",
    ", the long - run behavior of the model depends only on the two non - dimensional parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , defined as @xmath30 the parameter space can be divided into two regions , as shown in fig  [ phaseplane ] . for the region in the upper left , where @xmath31 ( or equivalently @xmath32 ) , the mean interest rate is large in comparison to the noise .",
    "the long - run discounting function decays exponentially at rate @xmath33 . for the region in the lower right @xmath34 and thus @xmath35 , meaning the discount function @xmath14 _ increases _ exponentially . on the boundary , @xmath36 ,",
    "the long run interest rate @xmath37 and the discount function is asymptotically constant .",
    "how is it possible for the discount function @xmath14 to increase ?",
    "this is easy to understand when there are persistent periods of negative real interest rates @xmath11 .",
    "computation of the discount function @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) involves an average over exponentials , rather than the exponential of an average . as a result ,",
    "periods where interest rates are negative are greatly amplified and can easily dominate periods where interest rates are large and positive , even if the negative rates are rarer and weaker ( see appendix ) .",
    "it does not take many such periods to produce long - run exponential growth of @xmath14 .",
    "more surprising , eq .",
    "( [ r_inf ] ) shows that it is possible to get a negative long - run discounting rate even if negative real rates are rare .",
    "this occurs when @xmath38 , or equivalently , when @xmath39 , corresponding to the identity line in fig  [ phaseplane ] . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ r_inf ] ) , if @xmath40 then @xmath35 ; if we keep the ratio @xmath41 fixed while making @xmath20 sufficiently small , then @xmath6 will rarely be negative ( indeed , in this case @xmath42 as @xmath43 ) .",
    "the region where this is true corresponds to the blue wedge in the upper middle region of fig  [ phaseplane ] .",
    "we fit the parameters of the ou model to each of the data series as described in the appendix .",
    "the resulting parameters are listed in table [ tab3 ] , and the position @xmath44 of each country is shown in fig  [ phaseplane ] .",
    "the countries divide into two very clear groups .",
    "nine countries , with relatively stable real interest rates , have long - run positive rates .",
    "they are in the exponentially decaying region to the upper left and are tightly clumped together near the zero long - run interest rate curve .",
    "five countries with less stable behavior , in contrast , are in the exponentially increasing region , which implies they have long - run negative rates , and are widely scattered .",
    "( it may not be a coincidence that all five have experienced fascist governments ) . in four cases the average log interest rate @xmath18 is negative due to at least one period of runaway inflation ;",
    "the exception is spain , which has a ( highly positive ) mean real interest rate , but still has a long - run negative rate .",
    "note that all fourteen countries are below the identity line in fig  [ phaseplane ] , indicating that negative real interest rates are common  even in the stable countries they occur @xmath45 of the time .    in fig .",
    "[ discountexamples ] we show the discount function @xmath14 for all countries as a function of time , illustrating the dramatic difference between the two groups . in most cases the behavior is monotonic ; however , it can also be non - monotonic , as illustrated by argentina , which initially increases and then decreases .    in every case convergence to the long - run rate happens within 30 years , and typically within less than a decade .",
    "this is in contrast to other treatments of fluctuating rates , which assume short term rates are always ( or nearly always ) positive and predict that the decrease in the discounting rate happens over a much longer timescale , which can be measured in hundreds or thousands of years @xcite .    to provide an estimate of statistical fluctuations",
    "we break each country s data into four equal sized blocks and estimate the parameters for each block separately .",
    "we quote the maximum and minimum values for each country in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "this analysis reveals that statistical uncertainty is large .",
    "focusing on the long - run interest rate @xmath17 , all countries have positive maximums and most have negative minimums  only the usa , uk , and denmark have positive @xmath17 in all four samples .",
    "sub - sample variations are more than an order of magnitude larger than standard errors , indicating strong non - stationarity .     as a function of time for the ornstein - uhlenbeck model for the fourteen countries in our sample .",
    "@xmath14 quickly reaches its long - run exponential behavior .",
    "the long - run rates of the unstable countries vary dramatically , while most of the stable countries are fairly similar.[discountexamples],width=336 ]",
    "our analysis here demonstrates that since real interest rates are often negative , and indeed are observed more than a quarter of the time , one must use a model that is compatible with this property . for this purpose",
    "we use the ornstein - uhlenbeck model , which we solve analytically .",
    "our solution makes it easy to understand why the long - run discount rate is so low .",
    "the first reason is that real interest rates are typically fairly low .",
    "the average over all countries is @xmath46 , and even the average over stable countries ( those with @xmath33 ) is @xmath47 .",
    "the second reason is that the fluctuation term in the second part of eq .",
    "( [ r_inf ] ) , which depends both on the fluctuation amplitude @xmath19 and the persistence term @xmath26 , typically lowers rates for the stable countries by about @xmath48 . in some cases , such as spain ,",
    "the effect is much more dramatic : even though the mean short term rate has the high value of @xmath49 , the long - term discounting rate is @xmath50 .",
    "averaging over the five unstable countries the mean interest rate @xmath51 but @xmath52 .",
    "our analysis here makes several simplifications , such as ignoring non - stationarity and correlations between the environment and the economy .",
    "we believe that including these effects , as we hope to do in future work , will only drive the discounting rate closer to zero . the methods that we have introduced here provide a foundation on which to incorporate more realistic assumptions .",
    "we do not mean to imply that it is realistic to actually use the increasing discounting functions that occur for the five countries with less stable interest rate processes .",
    "there is some validity to treating hyper - inflation as an aberration  when it occurs government bonds are widely abandoned in favor of more stable carriers of wealth such as land and gold , and as a result under such circumstances the difference between nominal interest and inflation may underestimate the actual real rate of interest .    nonetheless , the real interest rate is typically closely related to economic growth , and economic downturns are a reality .",
    "the great depression lasted for 15 years , and the fall of rome triggered a depression in western europe that lasted almost a thousand years . in light of our results here , arguments that we should wait to act on global warming because future economic growth will easily solve the problem should be viewed with extreme skepticism .",
    "our analysis clearly supports stern over nordhaus : even if we throw out the five countries where we found asymptotically increasing discounting functions , the average long - run interest rate @xmath17 for the remaining nine countries is about @xmath3 , only slightly more than the @xmath0 used by stern .",
    "when we plan for the future we should always bear in mind that sustained economic downturns may visit us again , as they have in the past .",

    "since @xmath59 we see from eq .",
