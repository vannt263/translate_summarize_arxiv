    "the purpose of this paper is to characterize primitive substitutive sequences , i.e.   sequences defined as the image , under a morphism , of a fixed point of a primitive substitution .",
    "no general characterizations of these sequences are known . in this paper",
    "we give one , it uses a notion we introduce here , the _ return word_. we do nt know reference or study about it , except in the area of symbolic dynamical systems , where it is closely related to _ induced transformations _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "but no combinatoric results are obtained",
    ".    for some classes of sequences arising from substitutions characterizations exist .",
    "the first class appearing in the literature is the class of the sequences generated by @xmath0-substitutions , also called _ uniform tag sequences _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "these are images , under a `` letter to letter '' morphism , of a fixed point of a substitution of constant length @xmath0 .",
    "a. cobham @xcite proved that a sequence is generated by a @xmath0-substitution if and only if it is @xmath0-automatic , i.e.  if it is generated by a @xmath0-automaton ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath1 is a prime power , an algebraic characterization is given by g. christol , t. kamae , m. mends france and g. rauzy @xcite .",
    "and s. fabre @xcite generalized the theorem of a. cobham to a small class of substitutions of non - constant length , by introducing the concept of @xmath2-automaton and @xmath2-substitution .",
    "it turns out that our characterization is similar to the following known one : a sequence @xmath3 is generated by a @xmath0-substitution if and only if the set of the sequences @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , is finite ( @xcite ) .",
    "our main tool of this paper is the _ return word over u _",
    ", where @xmath7 is a non - empty prefix of a minimal sequence @xmath8 .",
    "it is defined as a word separating two successive factors of @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce a `` coding '' of @xmath8 with the return words over @xmath7 and obtain an other minimal sequence @xmath9 we call _ derived sequence _ of @xmath8 .",
    "the main result can be formulated as follows : _ a sequence is primitive substitutive if and only if the set of derived sequences is finite_.    the paper is divided into six sections .",
    "the next section contains the definitions , the notation and the basic results needed to state the main theorem .",
    "the third section shows that the condition of the characterization is sufficient . in the following one , we extend a result , useful for the proof of the main theorem , due to b. moss @xcite , concerning the `` power of words '' , to primitive substitutive sequences and we deduce some return word properties of these sequences . in the fifth section",
    "we prove the main theorem , considering first the case of the fixed point , and then the case of its image by a morphism .",
    "the last one deals with perspectives and open questions .",
    "let us recall some standard notations we can find in @xcite .",

    "we will call @xmath42 the set of letters occurring in @xmath8 .    if @xmath8 is a word , we use the same terminology with the similar definitions .",
