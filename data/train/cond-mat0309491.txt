    "<S> a central problem for implementing efficient quantum computing is how to realize fast operations ( both one- and two - bit ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is difficult to achieve for a collection of qubits , especially for those separated far away , because the interbit coupling is usually much weaker than the intrabit coupling . here </S>",
    "<S> we present an experimentally feasible method to effectively couple two flux qubits via a common inductance and treat both single and coupled flux qubits with more realistic models which include the loop inductance . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of our proposal is that a strong interbit coupling can be achieved using a small inductance , so that two - bit operations as fast as one - bit ones can be easily realized . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the flux dependence of the transitions between states for the coupled flux qubits . </S>"
