    "this fundamental period is of great importance , @xcite , @xcite . to compute the taylor expansion of @xmath5 in the neighborhood of @xmath6 we write @xmath7 and integrate using cauchy s formula .",
    "the @xmath8-th coefficient in the power series expansion of @xmath5 is therefore the constant term of the @xmath8-th power of the laurent polynomial @xmath9 .",
    "for example the constant term of the 151st power of @xmath10 is + @xmath11 a number with 200 digits .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following general problem : + _ how to compute for a multivariate ( laurent ) polynomial @xmath9 the coefficient of the monomial @xmath12 of the @xmath13-th power , @xmath14 of @xmath9 . _",

    "why cantt we just split the problem in smaller ones and compute @xmath15 and @xmath16 s.t . @xmath17 and get the coefficient we are interested in by cauchys product formula @xmath18 a general polynomial in @xmath8 variables in which the degree of each individual variable is not greater than @xmath19 has @xmath20 monomials . in our example",

    "therefore , the amount of memory needed to store one particular coefficient will , typically , linearly grow with @xmath13 .",
    "another possibility is to use a multivariate discrete fourier transform : evaluate the polynomial @xmath9 on sufficently many points of the @xmath8-dimensional grid of roots of unity of sufficient high degree , compute the @xmath13-th power of the values and apply the inverse discrete fourier transform to get the single coefficient we are interested in . here",
