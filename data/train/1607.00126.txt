    "entanglement is a pure quantum mechanical phenomenon which shows the quantum correlations between multi sub - systems .",
    "this strange phenomenon has recently attracted a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "this notion has many applications such as quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite , sensitive measurements @xcite and quantum telecloning @xcite .",
    "there are many implementations to produce entangled states , such as trapped ions @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , photon pairs @xcite and superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the interaction of atoms with various types of cavity field ( with additional interaction terms such as kerr medium , etc . )",
    "is an efficient source of entanglement @xcite . on the other hand , because of the unavoidably interaction between any real system with its surrounding environment , dissipation is ever present .",
    "this natural process usually leads to loss of entanglement stored in those systems , i.e. disentanglement occurs .",
    "so , many attentions have been paid to the theory of open quantum systems @xcite . in this regard",
    ", the lindblad master equation can be used to express the quantum master equation for a dissipative system which is based on the temporal evolution of the density operator of the system @xcite . in a different way",
    ", one can deal with the time evolution of the wave function of the system instead of density operator by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "recently , the case of two two - level atoms dissipating into a common heat bath has been considered in @xcite , where the authors have considered the surrounding environment as a zero - temperature bosonic reservoir and solved the related time dependent schrdinger equation . in another point of view ,",
    "one of the interesting topics in dissipative systems is to find a way to fight against the deterioration of the entanglement .",
    "many schemes have been proposed in order to preserve entanglement in such systems in literature .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that , addition of a laser field leads to the high stationary entanglement @xcite .",
    "another approach to overcome this problem , relies on active feedback @xcite . beside these ,",
    "the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) is a promising way to avoid the decaying behaviour of the entanglement in dissipative systems .",
    "this effect which refers to the inhibition of the temporal evolution of a quantum system by repeated projective measurements during a defined period of time , has been discussed theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .    in this paper , we intend to extend the idea of a dissipative cavity into a model , in which the atoms interact with a cavity field and the cavity mode itself interacts with the surrounding environment .",
    "we model the surrounding environment as a set of continuum harmonic oscillators . in this",
    "regard , this idea can be used for modelling the dissipative cavity that photons in the cavity should leak out to a continuum of states .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this model of dissipation is called the gardiner - collett hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "this model leads to a lorentzian spectral density which is directly obtained from our modelling of the dissipative cavity .",
    "whereas , in the previous studies , it is assumed that the spectral density should be a lorentzian one @xcite .",
    "this kind of spectral density implies the nonperfect reflectivity of the cavity mirrors .",
    "we obtain the exact entanglement dynamics as a function of the environment correlation time for both weak and strong couplings corresponding to the bad and good cavity limits , respectively .",
    "it should be noticed that , our results are outside of the markovian regime .",
    "in fact , for special values of the environment correlation time , we are able to obtain the two - atom jaynes - cummings model and markovian regime . for typical values of this parameter , our model interpolates between these two limits .",
    "in addition , considering the qze , we use the action of a series of nonselective measurements on the collective atomic system , showing that , the presence of measurements can quenches the decay of the entanglement . our results are verifiable and confirmable with a slight modification in both cavity qed experiments with atoms ( or ions ) trapped in an electromagnetic cavity @xcite and superconducting josephson circuits @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , we introduce the hamiltonian of the system and simplify it by using the fano s technique . in section 3",
    "we try to find the wave vector of the system .",
    "section 4 deals with the investigation of the entanglement dynamics of the system by various measures . in section 5",
    ", we introduce the quantum zeno effect and show how to preserve the entanglement .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the system under our consideration consists of a dissipative cavity contains two two - level atoms with excited ( ground ) state @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "because of the presence of dissipation , the gardiner - collett approach to describe the dissipation seems to be useful .",
    "the gardiner - collett hamiltonian for a dissipative cavity is written as @xmath3 @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 are the annihilation ( creation ) and frequency of the cavity field , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the coupling coefficient which in general , is a function of frequency that connects the external world to the cavity , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation and annihilation operators of the surrounding environment at mode @xmath11 which obey the following commutation relation @xmath12   = \\delta(\\eta-\\eta^ { ' } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : commutationrelationsurrounding}\\ ] ] the second term of ( [ eq : gardinerhamiltonian ] ) can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of a driving single - excitation source @xcite .",
    "altogether , the suitable hamiltonian which describes our system is written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 in the above relation , @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of the atoms , @xmath16 represents the hamiltonian of the cavity fields , the surrounding environments as well as their interaction , and @xmath17 denotes the interaction between atoms and the cavity field . in the above set of relations @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the raising ( lowering ) operator of the @xmath20th atom , @xmath21 is the resonance frequency of the @xmath20th atom and @xmath22 is the coupling constant between @xmath20th atom and the cavity field . in the continuation , we assume that the surrounding environment has such a narrow bandwidth such that only a particular mode of the cavity may be excited @xcite .",
    "this assumption allows us to extend integrals over @xmath11 back to @xmath23 and to take @xmath8 as a constant ( equal to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hfe ] ) can now be diagonalized using fano s technique @xcite .",

    "we can thus express @xmath5 in ( [ wq : dressedoperator ] ) as a linear combination of @xmath29 ; that is ( see appendix a ) @xmath35 consequently , the hamiltonian of our system can be finally rewritten in terms of the dressed operators as follows @xmath36 the obtained hamiltonian clearly implies that , the two atoms are dissipating in a common heat bath .",
    "now , we try to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation and obtain the state vector of the system at any time @xmath37 . before that , we introduce the collective coupling constant as @xmath38 and dimensionless relative strengths @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , in which we take only @xmath41 as independent .",
    "we assume that there is no excitation in the cavities before the occurrence of interaction and the two atoms are in a general superposition in the following form @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is the multi - mode vacuum state , where @xmath44 is the multi - mode state representing one photon at frequency @xmath45 and vacuum state in all other modes .",
    "accordingly , the quantum state of the entire system at any time can be written as    @xmath46    using the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath47 , one arrives at the following set of coupled integro - differential equations @xmath48 in the above relations we have used @xmath49 in the following , we assume that the two atoms have the same bohr frequency , i.e. @xmath50 , consequently , @xmath51 , and also we assume that the two atoms interact with cavity field in the exact resonance condition , i.e. @xmath52 . by integrating eq .",

    "for an ideal cavity ( i.e. @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 corresponds to a constant correlation function . in this situation",
    ", the system reduces to a two - atom jaynes - cummings model @xcite with vacuum rabi frequency @xmath63 . on the other hand , in the markovian regime , i.e. , for small correlation times ( with @xmath59 much larger than any other frequency scale )",
    ", we obtain the decay rate as @xmath64 .",
    "using eq . ( [ eq : state ] ) , the explicit form of the @xmath65 density matrix for atoms in the @xmath66 basis can be derived as @xmath67 a suitable measure for degree of entanglement ( dem ) for bipartite systems is concurrence . for qubits ,",

    "the concurrence varies between 0 ( when the atoms are separable ) and 1 ( when they are maximally entangled ) . for the density matrix given by ( [ eq : densitymatrix ] )",
    ", the concurrence becomes @xmath76    it is shown that the interaction with a _",
    "common _ environment can generate a highly entangled long - living decoherence - free ( or sub - radiant ) state @xcite .",

    "one can obtain @xmath84 as follow @xcite @xmath85 as it is seen , the obtained solution is quite exact and we have not used any approximation .",
    "we are now in a position to investigate the dynamics of entanglement as measured by concurrence . to begin with , as it is mentioned that there is a decoherence - free state due to interaction of atoms with common environment ( see eq .",

    "this is due to the fact that in this situation , only one atom interacts with the cavity field and there is no correlation between atoms via cavity field . in the case",

    "<S> we use the gardiner - collett hamiltonian to model the dissipative cavity , in which , we assume that the two atoms resonantly interact with the cavity field and the cavity field itself interacts with the surrounding medium . then , with the help of the fano s technique , we show that , this system can be regarded as two atoms interacting with a heat bath . in such a case , we find that , there exists a decoherence - free state that does not evolve in time . at this time , there exists a so - called super - radiant state which decays in time due to dissipation . at last , we use the quantum zeno effect to preserve the entanglement which already has been stored in the system .    </S>",
