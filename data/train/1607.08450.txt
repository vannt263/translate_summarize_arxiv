    "of wireless services in recent years has stimulated the need for improved spectrum management policies to exploit the abundant spectrum holes in existing licensed bands .",
    "cognitive radio ( cr ) has emerged as a potential technology that allows unlicensed or secondary users ( sus ) to temporarily access idle licensed bands exclusive to primary users ( pus ) @xcite . to avoid interference with pus , sus continuously sense the spectrum using artificial intelligent techniques and",
    "are preempted when a newly arriving pu finds insufficient bandwidth for its transmission .",
    "therefore , the degree of flexibility in spectrum sharing between pus and sus is regulated by the opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) policy in use @xcite@xcite .",
    "modelling osa schemes for crns has been the focus of many recent active research studies . in @xcite , an osa model with a single primary traffic for the pus and",
    "two prioritized secondary traffic classes for the sus was studied . in this work",
    ", the authors assumed that the blocked and preempted sus had no option other than to quit the system in absence of vacant bands . in practical scenarios however , such sus are expected to retry for service after some random amount of time . with regard to the retrial behavior of sus ,",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed a continuous - time markov chain ( ctmc ) with level - dependent quasi - birth - and - death ( qbd ) structure to analyze the effect of retrying sus on the performance of an unslotted crn . nonetheless , they dealt with the carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) protocol in a mixed environment of dedicated licensed and unlicensed bands . in @xcite , an @xmath0 retrial queueing framework for osa",
    "was proposed for single channel crns . in this paper",
    ", we divulge the impact of the retrial behavior of opportunistic sus in multi - channel crns where all spectrum bands are licensed to pus .",
    "we express the state transitions of the proposed osa model as a tri - variate ctmc and investigate the system performance in terms of the dropping probability and network throughput of sus .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] describes and formulates the system model , followed by derivations of the performance measures in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "analytical and simulation results are extensively discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , conclusive remarks are drawn in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we consider a multi - channel crn comprising of @xmath1 licensed bands , each divided into @xmath2 sub - bands . henceforth , we use the terms ` band ' and ` sub - band ' to refer to a bandwidth unit for pu and su traffic sources , respectively .",
    "as shown in , a pu requires one band @xmath3 while an su needs one sub - band @xmath4 for transmission .",
    "hence , when a given band is exploited by a pu , the underlying sub - bands are made unavailable to sus .",
    "a newly arriving pu occupies a band if vacant .",
    "otherwise , it preempts the sus using the sub - bands of one of the primary bands .",
    "the preempted sus then enter the orbit of size @xmath5 and retry again after some random time with rate @xmath6 . on retrial ,",
    "if a sub - band is idle , the su opportunistically utilizes it .",
    "otherwise , it repeats the cycle .",
    "a preempted or blocked su is dropped only if the orbit is full .",
    "we assume that pu and su arrivals follow poisson processes with rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "in this section , we derive the dropping probability @xmath67 and throughput @xmath68 of sus using the steady - state distribution obtained earlier .",

    "* when an su in service is preempted by an arriving pu and finds the orbit full , it quits the system with rate @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , @xmath67 , defined as the ratio of the dropping rate of sus to their arrival rate , is derived to be : @xmath72.\\ ] ]    the achievable throughput of sus is the number of sus that succeed in accessing sub - bands per unit time and is @xcite : @xmath73",

    "also , all simulation results have been averaged over 100 runs .    depicts @xmath78 as functions of the user arrival rates for varying @xmath79 values with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . to highlight the retrial effect ,",
    "our scheme is compared with a non - retrial system ( i.e. @xmath82 ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath83 increases with the arrival rate of pus .",
    "this probability however , reduces substantially with increase in bands and sub - bands . in comparison to the non - retrial system , the proposed model yields lower @xmath83 values .",
    "for instance , at @xmath84 , @xmath83 reduces by almost @xmath85 as @xmath1 increases to 3 and further by about @xmath86 as @xmath2 rises to 3 in presence of retrying sus .",
    "similarly , @xmath83 increases with the arrival rate of sus .",
    "however , as @xmath8 increases , @xmath83 in our scheme converges to that of the non - retrial system accounting for unavailable sub - bands and full orbit size .            for the same system parameters , the effect of @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the throughput of sus are shown in .",
    "it is evident that for any given @xmath79 , @xmath87 decreases as @xmath7 increases , whereas it interestingly rises with increase in @xmath8 .",
    "this is because of the retrial action of sus that result in higher sub - band utilization as the number of sus entering the system increases . for @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ", @xmath87 steeply falls by almost @xmath85 as @xmath2 decreases to 2 , while this difference is less than @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "this clearly justifies the fact that more number of bands increases the spectrum utilization opportunity for sus .",
    "finally , signifies the impact of su retrial rate on their dropping probability and throughput for @xmath92 .",
    "we see that the dropping probability of sus in the system can be reduced if the preempted / blocked sus try to access idle sub - bands more frequently . in other words , the chances of sus finding vacant sub - bands is higher if they keep retrying for service at higher rates . likewise",
    ", increasing @xmath5 allows for the accommodation of more sus and thus , further alleviates their probability of being forced to leave the system .",
    "the dropping probabilities for all @xmath5 values eventually stabilize for high retrial rates .",
    "the opposite impact however , is anticipated for su throughput , i.e. with increase in @xmath6 , more sus are able to access the sub - bands .",
    "the higher su throughput for orbits with larger capacities is also apparent in this figure .",
    "an osa scheme for multi - band crns was investigated in this paper , wherein the retrial behavior of blocked and pre - empted sus was considered .",
    "the proposed scheme was modeled as a three - variate markov chain and the steady - state probability distribution was obtained using matrix geometric method .",
    "measures such as su dropping probability and throughput were derived analytically and justified through simulation results .",
    "results revealed the evident impact of retrial phenomenon with respect to pu and su arrival rates , the orbit size , and retrial rate of sus in the orbit . a possible extension to this work is considering general distributions for the inter - arrival time , service time , and retrial time .",
