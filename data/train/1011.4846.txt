    "these massive galaxies largely stopped forming stars at redshifts @xmath9 , and their stellar populations subsequently for the most part evolved and reddened passively .",
    "the bulk of the star formation activity in the universe shifts to lower and lower mass galaxies as cosmic time proceeds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this mass dependent shift in star formation activity might be the basis of the observed bimodality in colour - magnitude space , where we see a population of old , passive , red galaxies following a relatively tight correlation between colour and magnitude , the so - called red sequence , and a population of young , starforming , blue galaxies , which occupy a rather diffuse area in colour - magnitude space , known as the blue cloud .",
    "the presence of a strong correlation between galaxy colour and stellar mass is supported by numerous observational studies in the local universe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we know that the bulk of star formation occurs in the early universe with half of the currently existing stellar mass already in place by @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "it is also unknown where most of the star formation happens in the early universe .",
    "does the local sfr - density relation turn around by @xmath8 , as reported by some authors @xcite , or is the local morphology - density relation already present early in the history of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also know that massive red galaxies exist at very high redshifts , but what are their typical environments ? are they already found preferentially at higher local densities like most red galaxies in the local universe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "can we witness their transformation from heavily star - forming to passively evolving galaxies , i.e. the build - up of the red sequence in the colour - magnitude relation ?",
    "if so , when and where does it happen ? does the red sequence grow `` inside - out '' , from the densest to the least dense regions , or is it the stellar mass that predominantly determines the evolutionary path of a galaxy ?    in this study we intend to answer some of the above questions by investigating the relationship between galaxy colours , stellar mass and local densities in the early universe at @xmath14 .",
    "recent high-@xmath13 studies of the environmental influence on galaxy evolution have focused on investigating the presence of bright neighbours and the incidence of major merging ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "magnitudes are measured using the mag_auto output parameter , which measures the flux in a kron - like elliptical aperture , where the aperture is not fixed but depends on the light distribution of the galaxy .",

    "stars , and obvious spurious detections , were removed from the catalogue , yielding a total of 8298 galaxies in the final full catalogue .",

    "the nature of these sources and a full analysis on the likelihood of some of them being @xmath35 galaxies is presented in @xcite .",
    "the photometric redshifts were obtained by fitting template spectra to the @xmath36 photometric data points .",
    "the degeneracy in color - redshift space is problematic , especially when few filters are available . to cope with this effect we used two different approaches : the standard @xmath37 minimisation procedure , using hyperz @xcite and the bayesian approach using bpz @xcite .",
    "the synthetic spectra used by hyperz are constructed with the bruzual & charlot evolutionary code @xcite representing roughly the different morphological types of galaxies found in the local universe .",
    "we use 5 template spectra corresponding to the spectral types of e , sa , sc and i m as well as a single burst scenario .",
    "the reddening law is taken from @xcite .",
    "the photo - z code then computes the most likely redshift solution in the parameter space of age , metallicity and reddening .",
    "the best fit redshift and corresponding probability are then output together with the best fit parameters of spectral type , age , metallicity , @xmath38 and secondary solutions .",
    "the bayesian approach uses a similar template fitting method , apart from using empirical rather than synthetic template seds .",
    "the main difference though is that it relies not only on the maximum likelihood of the redshift solution in the parameter space as described above .",
    "instead it uses additional empirical information about the likelihood of a certain combination of parameters , also called prior information .",
    "the redshift solution with the maximum likelihood is determined after weighting the probability of each solution by the additional probability determined from the prior information . in our case",
    "the prior is the distribution of magnitudes for the different morphological types as a function of redshift , obtained from the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) data @xcite . in short",
    ", the code not only determines the best fit redshift and spectral type , but takes into account how likely it is to find a galaxy of that spectral type and magnitude at the given redshift .    to assess the reliability of our photometric redshifts we compare them to available spectroscopic redshifts in the goods fields .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of sources in the goods - n field were compiled by @xcite , whereas the goods - s field spectroscopic redshifts are taken from the fireworks compilation @xcite .",
    "we matched the two catalogues to our photometric catalogue with a matching radius of @xmath33 , obtaining 537 spectroscopic redshifts for our sources in goods - n and 369 in goods - s , adding up to 906 redshifts in total .",
    "the mean separation between photometric and spectroscopic sources is @xmath39 arcsec in the goods - n field and @xmath40 arcsec in the goods - s field .",
    "the reliability of photometric redshift measures is usually defined as @xmath41 . in the following",
    "we compare the median offset from the one - to - one relation between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , @xmath42 , and the rms scatter around this relation , @xmath43 .",
    "we find good agreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for both codes , however , hyperz is slightly better at identifying outliers by assigning low probabilities to their redshifts .",
    "the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "high probability @xmath44 are circled in red .",
    "the lower panel shows the @xmath45 dependence on redshift @xmath46 : there is no clear trend with redshift , with perhaps a slight trend to underestimate @xmath13 at high redshifts .",
    "we obtain the following results for hyperz : when considering only high probability photometric redshifts ( @xmath47 ) , the median offset is @xmath48 , with a scatter of @xmath49 ( 356 out of 906 galaxies with @xmath47 ) . using all redshifts",
    "regardless of their probability , the median offset decreases to @xmath50 , while the scatter rises slightly to @xmath51 .",
    "bpz gives comparable offsets , but slightly higher scatters : @xmath42 = 0.026 with a scatter of @xmath52 for high probability redshifts ( 792 out of 906 ) and @xmath53 and @xmath54 for all galaxies .",
    "bpz identifies more redshifts with a high probability than hyperz , however , they are not necessarily better than the low probability redshifts , as shown by the comparable scatter .",
    "overall , the performance of hyperz is slightly better than that of bpz .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath25-band magnitude .",
    "hyperz and bpz results are plotted as circles and crosses respectively . only galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath55 are shown in this plot .",
    "the median offset and rms scatter are computed in each magnitude bin and are plotted as big symbols ( with corresponding errorbars ) in red for the hyperz output and in blue for the bpz output .",
    "the figure shows the slightly better performance of hyperz , which is also visible in the fraction of catastrophic outliers with @xmath56 ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the redshift error is stable up to faint magnitudes of @xmath57 , as is the fraction of outliers .    in the following we use the hyperz photometric redshifts , regardless of their probability .",
    "we use all probability redshifts since this gives us a much larger sample of galaxies with only a slightly higher scatter .",
    "we now investigate the performance of hyperz at different redshifts , at low redshift ( @xmath58 ) and in the redshift range of @xmath55 , which is the redshift range of the galaxy sample we use in this study .",
    "these are the values that are used in the monte carlo simulations described in section  [ mc ] to account for the photometric redshift errors . for the high redshift sample",
    "we obtain an average offset @xmath59 and a rms of @xmath60 , with a fraction of catastrophic outliers of @xmath61 . as above catastrophic outliers",
    "are defined as galaxies with @xmath56 , which corresponds to @xmath15 3 times the rms scatter .",
    "galaxies below @xmath62 show a slightly lower , but still comparable scatter of @xmath63 , however the outlier fraction decreases dramatically to only @xmath64 .",
    "the comparison of our results with photometric redshifts already available for the brighter part of our sample shows that our photometric redshifts are of comparable quality .",

    "a large set of synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is constructed from the stellar population models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 ) , assuming a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the star formation history is characterised by an exponentially declining model with various ages , metallicities and dust extinctions .",
    "these models are parametrised by an age of the onset of star formation , and by an e - folding time such that    @xmath68    where the values of @xmath69 are randomly selected from a range between 0.01 and 10 gyr , while the age of the onset of star formation ranges from 0 to 10 gyr .",
    "the metallicity ranges from 0.0001 to 0.05 ( bc03 ) , and the dust content is parametrised by @xmath70 , the effective v - band optical depth for which we use values @xmath71 .",
    "the model seds are then fit to the observed photometric datapoints of each galaxy using a bayesian approach . for each galaxy a likelihood distribution for the stellar mass , age and absolute magnitude at all star formation histories described above is computed .",
    "we chose to compute rest - frame @xmath6 colours , since the wavelength range of the @xmath72 and @xmath29 bands is covered best by the observed optical and h bands .",
    "the peak of the likelihood distribution is then adopted as the galaxy s stellar mass and absolute @xmath72 and @xmath29-band magnitude , while the uncertainty of these values is given by the width of the distribution .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath6 colours are obtained by subtracting the two absolute magnitudes . while parameters such as age , e - folding time and metallicity are not accurately fit due to various degeneracies , the stellar masses and colours are robust . from the width of the probability distributions we determine typical errors for our stellar masses of 0.2 dex .",
    "there are additional uncertainties from the choice of the imf and due to photometric errors , resulting in a total random error of our stellar masses of @xmath150.3 dex , roughly a factor of two .",
    "we do not probe with our filters redder than roughly the rest - frame @xmath29-band at @xmath0 in our measurements of stellar masses .",
    "the reason for this is similar to our reasons for not using longer wavelength data for the photometric redshifts - essentially there is no data redder than the @xmath73band which has the same fidelity and depth as the @xmath36 bands we use in this paper .",
    "the k - band data available from the ground is no where near as deep as the @xmath73band nicmos data .",
    "while we have irac data for our sources , we do not use these data due to the psf issues and contamination from neighbouring galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the rest - frame @xmath29-band gives us a good anchor for measuring stellar masses , as is shown by e.g. , @xcite at lower redshifts , and @xcite for higher redshifts .",
    "there is also a question as to whether or not our stellar masses are overestimated by the choice of stellar population models used .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite , among others , that the @xcite models we use here can result in stellar masses that are too high by a factor of a few due to how thermal - pulsating agb stars are treated . while we consider random uncertainties of a factor of two in our stellar masses , it is worth investigating whether or not our stellar masses could suffer from a systematic bias . @xcite",
    "have determined that galaxy stellar masses computed with an improved treatment of tp - agb stars are roughly 50 - 60% lower . however , the effect of tp - agb stars is less important at the rest - frame wavelengths we probe than it is at longer wavelengths , especially in the rest - frame ir .",
    "our sample is selected in the @xmath25-band , which corresponds roughly to rest - frame @xmath74-band at @xmath75 and approximately rest - frame @xmath29-band at @xmath0 , where the effects of tp - agb stars are negligible , as shown in previous work using similar data and the same stellar mass code @xcite . in this",
    "earlier study the effect of tp - agb stars was tested on a sample of massive galaxies by using the newer bruzual and charlot ( in preparation ) models , which include a new tp - agb star prescription . from this",
    "we find that stellar masses are on average 0.07 dex smaller than the ones calculated with the bc03 models .",
    "this systematic error is however much smaller than both the random error we assume ( 0.3 dex ) , and the cosmic variance uncertainties , and thus we conclude it is not a significant factor within our analysis .      to investigate the different behaviour of red and blue galaxies we split the sample into red and blue populations by their location in the colour - magnitude diagram . due to the low number of galaxies in our sample and the lack of accurate spectroscopic redshifts for the majority of objects , we do not attempt to fit the red sequence of the colour - magnitude relation in this study .",
    "instead we evolve the red sequence found at lower redshift back in time as expected from the passive colour evolution of an old stellar population .",
    "this procedure is valid due to the high formation redshift ( @xmath76 ) of red sequence galaxies in stellar population models .",
    "after the star formation has stopped , the stellar populations of these galaxies are supposedly ageing ( = reddening ) quickly and subsequently evolving passively @xcite .",
    "we take the red sequence of galaxies in the deep2 redshift survey at @xmath10 @xcite , converted to ab magnitudes :    @xmath77    and evolve it back with redshift according to @xcite .",
    "the separation between the narrow red sequence and the diffuse blue cloud was found to be present up to at least @xmath11 @xcite , with a separation between the two populations of 0.25 magnitudes .",

    "is used to obtain the limiting stellar mass for the blue galaxy population .",
    "we obtain limiting stellar masses of @xmath79 for blue galaxies and @xmath80 for red galaxies respectively at @xmath81 .",
    "in figure  [ fig3 ] we plot stellar mass versus redshift @xmath13 for blue and red galaxies , as defined above .",
    "the dashed magenta line shows the completeness limit of @xmath82 at the upper redshift limit of @xmath3 ( dotted line ) we adopted in this study . the completeness of blue galaxies at a given stellar mass is higher than for red galaxies , which are more difficult to detect at high @xmath13 due to the shape of their sed .",
    "however , since we want to compare red and blue galaxy populations we have to make sure that our sample is not biased towards blue galaxies at high @xmath13 , and we therefore use the conservative stellar mass cut of @xmath82 .",
    "the colour dependent completeness limits and mass functions of red and blue galaxies in the gns are further investigated by mortlock et al .",

    "we will focus on the redshift range of @xmath67 , which provides a co - moving survey volume of @xmath83 mpc@xmath84 , minimising the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "the cosmic variance associated with a certain co - moving volume depends on the clustering strength of the objects and can be roughly estimated from the average galaxy number density and the expected variance of dark matter halos at a certain redshift @xcite . for the co - moving volume of the gns within the redshift range of @xmath67 , and at the average stellar mass of galaxies in the survey ,",
    "we expect the influence of cosmic variance to be less than 10% .",
    "the final galaxy catalogue we use in the following comprises 1289 galaxies down to a stellar mass of @xmath82 within the redshift range of @xmath67 .",
    "in this study we investigate the environment of each galaxy by computing projected local number densities .",
    "we use two different methods to derive local densities : ( 1 ) the aperture density , based on galaxy counts in a fixed physical aperture and ( 2 ) the nearest neighbour density , based on the distance to the 3@xmath4 , 5@xmath5 and 7@xmath5 nearest neighbour . for both methods we use a redshift interval of @xmath85 to minimise the contribution of foreground or background objects . as for the stellar masses and rest frame colours , spectroscopic redshifts are used to determine these properties , if available .",
    "the two methods are described in more detail in the following section .",
    "the fixed aperture densities are measured by counting neighbouring galaxies within a fixed physical radius ( or aperture ) and redshift interval .",
    "the fixed physical radius was chosen to be 500 @xmath86 kpc , which is roughly the size of a single gns pointing at @xmath87 .",
    "the number of objects within 500 @xmath86 mpc co - moving radius at a galaxy s distance and within @xmath85 is computed for each galaxy , yielding the surface density @xmath88 in galaxies per mpc@xmath1 .",
    "edge effects are a major issue due to the design of the gns , since it does not have a continuous survey area , and edges are encountered frequently .",
    "the radius of 500 @xmath86 kpc is not covered for all galaxies , especially for galaxies close to the edges of isolated , non - overlapping pointings , since the field of view of a single pointing covers about 500 kpc at @xmath89 . to account for the area lost due to survey edges we approximate the surveyed area around each galaxy by the number of image pixels within the aperture , which are actually covered by the observations .",
    "@xmath88 is then normalised by the number of pixels within the aperture .",
    "this procedure effectively accounts for differences in aperture area due to galaxies being close to survey edges .",
    "the normalisation however does not account for variations with redshift due to differences in depth and resolution .",
    "to account for those differences we divide each galaxy number density by the median density ( denoted by the angled brackets ) of all galaxies within a redshift slice of @xmath85 centred on the galaxy .",
    "this then gives the relative overdensity    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the overdensity , i.e. the density excess over the median density .",
    "using the logarithm of @xmath92 divides the sample in under- and over - dense environments relative to the average density , where by definition @xmath93 .",
    "nearest neighbour densities are widely used in the literature to characterise local galaxy environment .",
    "the best choice of the number of neighbours to count , @xmath94 , is open to debate , and depends on the characteristics of the sample and the survey .",
    "values from @xmath95 @xcite up to @xmath96 @xcite have been used in different studies , depending on the size and mass of the structure that is investigated .",
    "a high @xmath94 is suited for high - mass and high density areas like galaxy clusters , whereas in low density environments a high @xmath94 measures the distance to other structures rather than characterising the local galaxy density , and therefore a smaller @xmath94 should be used .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the choice of @xmath94 does not change the resulting densities significantly . in this study",
    "we measure third , fifth and seventh nearest neighbour densities and compare the results in section  [ results : densities ] .    to account for edge effects a similar technique as used for the aperture densities described above",
    "is employed .",
    "first , the distance to the third , fifth and seventh nearest galaxy , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , within the redshift interval of @xmath100 is computed for each galaxy .",
    "then , we count the number of image pixels within the area @xmath101 to approximate the covered area around each galaxy .",
    "since the number of pixels within @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) is directly proportional to the covered area , it can be used instead of @xmath101 to compute the surface density @xmath104 .",
    "this gives @xmath105 in arbitrary units , which is ideal for our purposes , since we are only interested in relative densities and @xmath105 is normalised by the median value in each redshift slice , @xmath106 .",
    "the nearest neighbour density in units of a relative overdensity is then given by :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 itself is the overdensity and @xmath94 has the values of 3 , 5 and 7 respectively .",
    "analogue to the nearest neighbour density we use @xmath109 to distinguish between underdense ( @xmath110 ) and overdense ( @xmath111 ) environments .      to estimate the reliability of the local density estimates",
    "we perform a set of monte carlo simulations .",

    "we take the typical photometric redshift error @xmath113 in our redshift range of @xmath55 and assume a gaussian distribution of errors , where the width of the distribution @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath112 . for each galaxy a random value is selected within this distribution , which is then added to the measured photo - z .",
    "galaxies outside our redshift range of interest are included in the randomisation to account for scattering in and out of the redshift range we use .",
    "those galaxies obtain an added value according to the respective @xmath112 in their redshift range .",

    "the offsets are randomly picked from the interval @xmath118 and added or subtracted from the original redshift .    following the above procedure",

    "it also accounts for scattering galaxies in and out of the redshift range we use in this study ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the catalogue of randomised photometric redshifts is then used to recompute the local densities , aperture and nearest neighbour densities , as described above .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated 100 times , obtaining 100 randomised local density estimates , from which we then compute the average local density uncertainty .",
    "the local density error for each individual galaxy is given by the standard deviation of all monte carlo runs .",
    "these individual errors are then averaged to obtain an average uncertainty of the respective local density estimator .",
    "we obtain the following average uncertainties for the different local density estimates : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 for the three nearest neighbour densities and @xmath122 for the aperture density .",
    "these values of around 0.2 dex show the we can measure local densities with roughly the same or even slightly better accuracy than stellar masses ( see section  [ stellar mass and colours ] ) .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulations are also discussed in the context of the relations between colour density and stellar mass in the following sections , and are shown in the respective figures .",
    "in the following we first discuss the correlations between the local galaxy densities @xmath109 and @xmath123 .",
    "we then investigate the colour - magnitude relation in bins of stellar mass and bins of local density , and show the behaviour of rest - frame colour @xmath6 and blue fraction of galaxies as a function of both local density ( @xmath124 ) and stellar mass ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "additionally , we test differences between galaxy properties in the high and low quartiles of the local density and stellar mass distributions respectively .",

    "this scatter reflects the average uncertainty of the local density measurements of @xmath138 dex obtained by the monte carlo simulations described in section  [ mc ] .",

    "the different sensitivity of the different values of @xmath94 is visible at the low density end , where the higher @xmath94 traces the average densities on larger scales , rather than local underdensities , which we are interested in . at densities above",

    "the @xmath140 nearest neighbour density is by construction a better tracer of the extremes in the local density distribution , since it uses an adaptive area and therefore is sensitive to galaxy concentrations at very small scales , that the fixed aperture can not probe .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath94 , the more sensitive the density measure is to local galaxy concentrations on small scales .",
    "these very local galaxy concentrations however are potentially influencing the evolution of a galaxy dramatically via merging or galaxy interactions .    in the following we use the @xmath127 nearest neighbour density @xmath124 as a local density estimator , since - although it has slightly larger uncertainties than the other density estimates ( see section  [ mc ] ) - it has a wider dynamical range and higher sensitivity to the most underdense and overdense environments and is therefore a better probe of the local environment .",

    "the location of these galaxies in the colour - magnitude diagram is consistent with the location expected from passively evolving back the red sequence found at @xmath10 ( see above ) . at @xmath147 this region in colour - magnitude space",
    "is populated mainly by the most massive galaxies ( @xmath148 ) , while at lower @xmath13 the range of galaxies on or close to the red sequence extends towards lower mass galaxies .",

    "galaxies close to or on the location of the red sequence span a wide range of local densities , and there is no clear preference for a certain environment , however , we do not see red galaxies uniquely located in the most overdense regions .",
    "this is opposite to what was found at lower redshifts up to @xmath12 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "part of this evolution , as well as the lack of low - mass galaxies at high @xmath13 may be due to the fact that faint red galaxies become more difficult to detect with high @xmath13 than faint blue galaxies and we might miss some low surface brightness , low - mass red galaxies in our sample .",
    "however , the mass limit we adopt in this study is very conservative and our sample should not be affected by colour - dependent incompleteness . a more detailed discussion on the stellar mass completeness and stellar mass functions for blue and red galaxies will be presented in mortlock et al .",

    "a strong relation between rest - frame colour and stellar mass and the apparent lack of a strong relation between colour and local density was found in the colour - magnitude relation in the previous section .",
    "we now investigate these correlations in more detail .",
    "the same redshift ranges as already used for the analysis of the colour - magnitude relation are used here : @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 . to quantify the correlation between two variables we compute spearman rank correlation coefficients @xmath74 .",

    "the correlation between @xmath6 colour and stellar mass @xmath125 is highly significant at all redshifts .",
    "spearman rank correlation coefficients in the three redshift bins range between 0.7 - 0.8 , corresponding to a significance of @xmath153 at all redshifts .",
    "the colour - mass relation also does not appear to evolve strongly with redshift .",
    "the cross - over mass , i.e. the stellar mass at which there is an equal number of red and blue galaxies , stays roughly constant at @xmath154 .",
    "this is the same cross - over mass found at lower redshifts @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "note that in the computation of blue and red galaxy fractions we account for the passive reddening of galaxy colours with redshift ( see section  [ completeness - colour ] ) .",
    "the fraction of blue galaxies over all stellar masses evolves with redshift from @xmath156 at @xmath0 to @xmath157 at @xmath7 .",
    "notice that the fading and reddening expected from passive evolution of a galaxy s stellar population is already accounted for in the definition of red and blue galaxies at each redshift . combining this with the above considerations of almost no evolution in the colour - stellar mass relation , the colour evolution is mainly taking place at low stellar masses of @xmath158 .",

    "the distribution of average blue fractions at the highest overdensities is not gaussian and the standard deviation does not represent the distribution adequately . to estimate the probability that the difference between high and low density is caused by chance",

    "we conclude that the colour - density relation at @xmath141 is practically not existent or very weak .",
    "if a trend with local density persists it must be very minor , with a variation of the average @xmath6 colours of less than @xmath150.1 magnitudes between relative local densities that differ by a factor of 100 . there could be an environmental influence on the blue fractions of galaxies in the most extreme overdense environments .",
    "this difference in blue fractions amounts to about 10% and is not detectable at a statistically significant level with the low number of galaxies in our sample located at the highest overdensities ( 33 galaxies at @xmath160 between @xmath67 ) .              in the following",

    "the stellar mass distribution has its low quartile at @xmath168 and the high quartile at @xmath169 .    after dividing the sample into low and high quartiles a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test between the different quartiles is used to investigate the statistical difference of the two subsamples . to increase the number statistics we consider the full redshift range of our sample at @xmath55 , instead of binning into the three redshift ranges used above .",
    "the stellar mass limit is kept at @xmath126 , as above .",
    "the k - s test gives the probability @xmath170 that the galaxy properties in the low and high quartile come from the same parent distribution .",
    "the statistical differences we find over the whole redshift range ( @xmath55 ) can be summarised as : + ( 1 ) galaxies in the low and high quartile of the local density distribution have marginally different colours ( @xmath171 , i.e. @xmath172 ) but not statistically different stellar masses ( @xmath173 , i.e. @xmath174 ) ; and + ( 2 ) galaxies in the low and high quartile of the stellar mass distribution have statistically different colours ( @xmath175 , i.e. @xmath176 ) , as well as marginally different local densities ( @xmath177 , i.e. @xmath178 ) .",
    "although the differences between the low and high stellar mass quartiles are much clearer than the differences in the local density quartiles , there is a difference at the 2 @xmath26 confidence level between the colours of galaxies in over and under - dense environments .",
    "we further investigate the reliability of this result by using the monte carlo simulations described in section  [ mc ] .    in figure  [ fig8 ] and",

    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows median @xmath6 colour , and two different densities ( fixed aperture density @xmath123 and third nearest neighbour density @xmath124 ) in the low ( blue ) and high quartile ( red ) of stellar mass .",
    "the average of all monte carlo runs in each redshift slice is overplotted as big symbols , blue circles for the low quartile and red triangles for the high quartile .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows that there is barely any difference in colour , blue fraction or stellar mass between the low and high quartile of local density .",
    "we may see evidence for a weak trend of a lower blue fraction at high densities emerging at @xmath180 , as well as a correspondent peak in the average stellar mass in the high density quartile , which is probably responsible for the positive correlation found from the k - s test on the data described above .",
    "however , we conclude that we lack the number statistics to reliably confirm the presence of a difference between low and high density quartile and that our data is consistent with there being no difference .",
    "note however that the lack of a clear separation between the low and high density quartiles does not contradict the results from the colour - density relation in section  [ colour - mass - density ] , where we possibly see evidence for a higher blue fraction in the most overdense environments above @xmath181 .",
    "the high density quartile includes all galaxies at densities above @xmath182 and does not comprise the extreme overdensities only , in which we see the higher blue fraction . since there is no relation with local density at densities below @xmath181 , we do not see any difference between the colours of galaxies in the low and high quartile of the density distribution .    we conclude that in the redshift range of @xmath55 the highest local overdensities ( @xmath160 , i.e. , an overdensity of roughly a factor of 5 ) possibly show a higher fraction of blue galaxies . at densities below @xmath181",
    "there is no correlation between rest - frame colours or fraction of blue galaxies with local density .",

    "the high quartile includes galaxies with @xmath169 ( red ) , while the low quartile corresponds to @xmath168 ( blue ) .",
    "there are strong differences in the rest - frame colour distributions of low- and high - mass galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "as already investigated in the previous section , high - mass galaxies have consistently redder colours ( @xmath183 magnitudes ) .",
    "these differences are highly significant .",
    "the colour difference of @xmath150.4 mag between the high- and low - mass quartile appears constant with redshift up to @xmath184 .",
    "the magenta line in the colour panel of figure  [ fig9 ] shows the distinction between red and blue galaxies calculated from the red sequence at @xmath10 evolved back in time assuming passive evolution of the stellar populations ( see section  [ completeness - colour ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the position of the blue line at @xmath185 in the colour - magnitude diagrams in figure  [ fig5 ] . at a redshift of @xmath184 the median colour of the high mass quartile decreases slightly towards the region occupied by the blue cloud",
    "however , a similar decrease is seen at redshifts below @xmath58 and is probably caused by the target selection of the gns , which favours the inclusion of very massive red galaxies between @xmath23 in our sample .",
    "this could slightly bias the average colour of massive galaxies towards redder colours within this redshift range .",
    "we see slight evidence for a mass segregation emerging at @xmath186 , where more massive galaxies tend to be located preferentially in high density areas ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this tentative result is consistent with what is found at lower and intermediate redshifts , where more massive galaxies tend to be located in high density environments ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath10 , see e.g. @xcite ) have suggested that the observed colour - density relation is mainly caused by the strong correlation between rest - frame colour and stellar mass .",
    "this also requires the presence of a stellar mass - density relation , such that higher mass galaxies are preferentially located in regions of higher overdensity .",
    "we indeed find a weak trend for this behaviour , emerging at @xmath187 , at a significance of @xmath188 ( see figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the extrapolation of a similar weak positive correlation between stellar mass and local density found at @xmath7 by @xcite , which seems to get steeper and more significant with decreasing redshift .",
    "another question is if the higher fraction of blue galaxies in high overdensities ( see section  [ colour - mass - density ] ) is due to a trend in stellar mass . to answer this question",
    "we investigate the colour - stellar mass relation and the colour - density relation in quartiles of local density and stellar mass respectively .",

    "combined with the results of the colour - density relation in figure  [ fig7 ] , this would point towards high - mass galaxies being responsible for the higher fraction of blue galaxies at the highest overdensities .",
    "note however that the rms scatter between the single monte carlo simulations is larger than the decrease in colour .",
    "this large spread is due to the low numbers of objects at the highest overdensities ( 33 galaxies at @xmath196 .",
    "the colour difference between the gns data - points and the @xmath7 data - points from g10 is mainly due to the differences in the stellar mass distribution in the two surveys , leading to different limits of the low and high quartiles .",

    "( submitted ) , suggesting a gradual disappearance of the colour density relation with redshift and a possible reversal of the colour - density relation at the most extreme overdensities at @xmath141 .      in the following",
    "we investigate how , and if , the environments of the most massive galaxies ( @xmath148 ) differ from the rest of the galaxy population and if there is a correlation between local density and galaxy size .",
    "the subsample of massive galaxies for which a size measurement is available comprises 57 galaxies from the selection of massive galaxies in the goods fields on which the gns pointings were centred @xcite .",
    "the measured local densities of those galaxies are very reliable since they are in the centre of their respective pointing and should not be affected by survey edges , as discussed in section  [ density ] .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig11 ] plots the local densities of the massive galaxy sample ( red dots ) and the rest of the sample ( blue circles ) against redshift .",
    "a k - s test between the two subsamples shows that they are not statistically different .    to examine a possible environmental effect on the sizes of massive galaxies in our sample , we use the galaxies effective radii measured by @xcite .",
    "they argue that the measured effective radii of these massive galaxies are consistently smaller than the typical effective radii of galaxies of comparable stellar mass in the local universe .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed to account for this size evolution , one of them being dry merging . in this scenario repeated minor merging of gas poor galaxies would not trigger the formation of new stars , but could possibly increase the size of a galaxy by dynamical friction and the injection of angular momentum @xcite . this scenario would then suggest a connection between galaxy sizes and local density , since it requires the presence of numerous companions for galaxies to grow in size .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig11 ] shows the effective radii @xmath203 of massive galaxies as a function of their local density @xmath124 .",
    "a spearman rank correlation test finds no significant correlation between @xmath203 and local density , although all galaxies in the most underdense environments ( @xmath204 ) have small @xmath203 ( @xmath205 3 kpc ) .",
    "however , due to the small number of objects in our sample this effect probably arises by chance .",
    "the lack of a correlation between galaxy size and local density is probably due to the different effects that the environment might have on galaxies .",
    "high local densities may not only increase the size of a galaxy via minor mergers as suggested by e.g. @xcite .",
    "high density environments might as well tidally truncate galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although tidal truncation is most effective on low - mass galaxies .",
    "another possibility is that the size evolution , does not occur through frequent minor merging of satellite galaxies , but through internal processes like agn feedback @xcite .",
    "in this study we investigate the influence of stellar mass and local density on galaxy rest - frame colour and the fraction of blue galaxies at redshifts between @xmath206 based on observational data from a deep hst @xmath25-band survey of unprecedented depth , the goods nicmos survey ( gns ) , reaching a stellar mass completeness limit of @xmath207 at @xmath3 .",
    "we find the following results :    1 .",
    "galaxy colour depends strongly on galaxy stellar mass at all redshifts up to @xmath0 .",
    "the colour - stellar mass relation does not evolve with redshift below @xmath0 .",
    "the stellar mass where the blue and red fractions cross over is roughly constant at @xmath208 in the redshift range between @xmath55 , which is remarkably similar to the cross - over mass found at lower redshifts between @xmath190 .",
    "the strong colour - stellar mass relation is very similar across all local environments and does not evolve strongly with redshift .",
    "the colour - stellar mass relation at @xmath67 has a slope similar to the relation at lower redshift ( @xmath190 ) , which also has a larger offset in colour between low and high local densities . at the same stellar mass , massive galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath67 ) are bluer than at low redshifts ( @xmath190 ) , whereas the average colour of lower mass galaxies ( @xmath192 ) does not vary strongly with redshift .",
    "we do not find a strong influence of local environment on galaxy colours .",
    "if the colour - density relation persists at @xmath141 it must be very weak .",
    "we determine an upper limit to the possible change in the average @xmath6 colour between high and low relative densities of @xmath209 magnitudes .",
    "however , the most overdense regions ( @xmath210 times overdense ) may be populated by a higher fraction of blue galaxies than average and underdense regions .",
    "the difference in @xmath211 is @xmath212 .",
    "we find possible evidence that this higher blue fractions at the most extreme overdensities could be caused by a lack of massive red galaxies at the highest local densities .",
    "+ 4 .   we do not find a significant correlation between galaxy sizes ( effective radii ) and relative overdensity , although we do not find any galaxies with large effective radii ( @xmath213kpc ) at very low densities ( @xmath214 .",
    "however , this might be due to the small number of objects we find in low density environments and is probably a chance effect .",
    "+    to summarise , our data suggests that stellar mass is the most important factor in determining the colours of galaxies in the early universe up to @xmath0 .",
    "local density might have a small additional effect , but only at the most extreme overdensities , which are populated by a higher fraction of blue galaxies .",
    "these results are consistent with studies at lower and intermediate redshift that suggest a gradual weakening of the environmental influence with higher redshift .",
    "a possible interpretation for this is that the environmental processes that alter the properties of galaxies are proceeding slowly over cosmic time .",
    "some of the most influential high density environments like galaxy clusters are still in the process of being build - up at @xmath141 and yet can not change galaxy colours via e.g. , ram pressure stripping or strangulation .",
    "if the trend for higher blue fractions at the highest local densities is real , it would suggest that we are witnessing the epoch of high star formation in more massive galaxies and that the local environment contributes to this epoch by triggering sf through galaxy interactions .",
    "note however , that the bluer colours at high local densities could as well be due to lower dust attenuation in these environments .",
    "the star formation rates of galaxies in the gns are currently investigated by bauer et al .",
    "( submitted ) and will be the focus of a subsequent study of the relation between sfr , stellar mass and local density ( grtzbauch et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "future deep and wide surveys such as the ukidss uds and vista will be better able to address the environment vs. stellar mass issue in more detail in the coming years .",
    "rg would like to thank jess varela for many useful discussions and very helpful suggestions .",
