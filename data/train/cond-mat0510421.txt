    "<S> these expressions are general and exact . </S>",
    "<S> one can use any of them , depending on what one determines in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we prefer to deal with two experimental quantities , the renormalized dispersion @xmath6 and mdc width @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we focus on the last equation .    for a linear bare dispersion , @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , this gives simple @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 here @xmath19 . in the last step we used the property of a parabolic function @xmath1 : @xmath20     real and imaginary parts of the self - energy ( shown by blue and red double headed arrows respectively ) on a photoemission image . </S>",
    "<S> bare band dispersion ( black solid line ) and renormalized dispersion ( red points ) . </S>",
    "<S> red solid line represents the momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) taken at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the position of mdc maximum determines @xmath21 , and the momenta of its half maximum level determine @xmath22 and @xmath23.,width=320 ]    it is interesting here to introduce an asymmetry factor @xmath24 which can be simply determined from experiment but keeps an information about underlying bare dispersion : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for parabolic dispersion @xmath28 .      </S>",
    "<S> _ is it physical for the renormalized velocity to be infinite ? _    from a formal point of view , one can not even write an expression for the renormalized dispersion @xmath29 , but only for its inverse function @xmath6 . e.g. , for a linear bare dispersion , @xmath30 , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ km ] ) , @xmath31 so , @xmath32 just when @xmath33 , i.e.  when @xmath34 decreases faster than @xmath5 ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation is quite natural because any sharp step in @xmath35 results in a discontinuity in @xmath36 .      </S>",
    "<S> _ what is the reason for the offset of the scattering rate ? </S>",
    "<S> _    </S>",
    "<S> a general answer is that the scattering rate determined from photoemission experiment consists of a finite experimental resolution @xmath37 , non - zero temperature contribution of the self - energy @xmath38 , and a scattering on impurities @xmath39 , but it is rather difficult to disentangle all of them . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental resolution is the main reason for this , since it depends not only on resolution of the analyser and a light source , @xmath40 but also on quality of sample surface , @xmath41 , and highly varies from sample to sample . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at present stage , we can only believe that accumulating the photoemission spectra from a number of samples and cleaves we approach the @xmath42 limit for the sharpest spectra . and </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that for these spectra the scattering on impurities , if sample - dependent , is also the lowest one . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in such a simple consideration we can only estimate a maximum limit for a minimal impurity scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimal value for the full width at half a maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath43-mdc at the nodal point is @xmath44 0.013 @xmath45 @xcite . using for an estimate eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ims_l ] ) and @xmath46 4 ev  gives an effective @xmath47 26 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the momentum resolution , derived from the angular resolution of the analyser about 0.1@xmath48 , @xmath49 0.007 @xmath45 or 14 mev ( here the renormalized velocity @xmath50 ev  should be used as a coefficient ) . the energy resolution @xmath51 12 </S>",
    "<S> mev . then , in case @xmath52 and @xmath53 are comparable , the overall resolution can be estimated as @xmath54 18 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of temperature into self - energy is most likely associated with the primary scattering channel due to direct electron - electron interactions ( auger - like decay ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this channel @xmath55 $ ] , and taking @xmath56 , @xmath57 13 mev at 300 k , but is negligible @xmath58 0.13 mev at 30 k.    thus , the above mentioned limit of the self - energy due to scattering on impurities at low temperature can be evaluated as @xmath59    it is interesting that with time due to surface aging @xmath60 become essentially higher , that can be explained by growing @xmath39 2 - 3 times of its initial value . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the increase of the impurity scattering with aging as well as with temperature can be in principle investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility comes from lineshape analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we have noticed that when approaching the fermi level the mdc lineshape demonstrates a crossover from lorentzian to gaussian , such as the sharpest @xmath43-mdcs better fit to an approximately equal mixture of both . </S>",
    "<S> this not only validates the above estimation but also shows a way of a careful evaluation of the constituents of @xmath60 , which , although , requires a very high experimental statistics .      </S>",
    "<S> _ how the resolution is taken into account ? </S>",
    "<S> _    in @xcite we consider a complex @xmath5-dependent contribution of the resolution , @xmath61 , to @xmath62 , the self - energy determined from the mdc width . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath63 through some real @xmath64 as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is an overall resolution parameter . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , @xmath67 and , through the kramers - kronig ( kk ) transforamation , @xmath68    in @xcite we derive @xmath69 empirically using @xmath66 as a parameter and consider only the variable part of @xmath13 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ims ] , i.e.  without the offset : @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> with such a procedure @xmath66 = 0.015 ev .    in principle , the resolution effect can be explicitly calculated from the known energy and momentum resolutions . if one knows the overall resolution , e.g.  @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath52 are the energy and momentum resolutions ( in energy units ) respectively , then @xmath73 </S>"
