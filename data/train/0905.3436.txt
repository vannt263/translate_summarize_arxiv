    "opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) and spectrum sharing ( ss ) are two basic operation models for the secondary radio or so - called cognitive radio ( cr ) system to operate over a common frequency band with an existing primary radio ( pr ) system . for the osa model ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , the cr usually deploys a spectrum sensing technique to detect the pr transmission on - off status over the frequency band of interest , and decides to transmit over this band if the sensing result indicates that the pr is not transmitting with a high probability .",
    "in contrast , the ss model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) allows the cr to transmit concurrently with the pr over the same frequency band , provided that the cr knows how to control its interference to the pr such that the resultant pr performance degradation is tolerable .",
    "since ss - based crs in general utilize the spectrum more efficiently than osa - based crs , this paper focuses on the ss model for crs .",
    "one commonly adopted method for ss - based crs to protect the pr transmission is via imposing an _ interference temperature _ constraint ( itc ) over the cr transmission , i.e. , the cr interference power level at each pr receiver must be kept below a prescribed threshold @xcite .",
    "some important design issues related to the itc - based approach are discussed as follows .",
    "first , the effectiveness of the itc to protect the pr transmission needs to be addressed . in @xcite and @xcite , it has been shown that the itc guarantees an upper bound on the maximum capacity loss of the pr channel due to the cr interference . in @xcite , an interesting _ interference diversity _",
    "phenomenon was discovered , where the average itc over different fading states was shown to be superior over the peak itc counterpart for minimizing the pr ergodic / outage capacity losses .",
    "second , it is pertinent to investigate more efficient methods for the cr to protect the pr than that with a fixed itc .",
    "such methods may exploit additional side information on the pr transmissions such as the pr s on - off status @xcite , automatic repeat request ( arq ) feedback @xcite , channel state information ( csi ) @xcite , spatial signal space @xcite , and frequency power allocation @xcite , in order to set more appropriate interference power levels over time , frequency , or space for cr s opportunistic transmission .",
    "thus , conventional itcs are replaced by the more relevant _ pr performance loss _ constraints @xcite . however , although these new methods are promising to improve the pr and cr spectrum sharing throughput , they usually require substantial overheads for implementation as compared with the itc .",
    "third , even implementation of the itc requires knowledge of the channel gain from the cr transmitter to the pr receiver , which is difficult to obtain for the cr without a dedicated feedback channel from the pr .",
    "if the pr link adopts a time - division - duplex ( tdd ) mode and thus the channel reciprocity holds between pr and cr terminals , the cr - to - pr channel gain can then be estimated by the cr from its observed pr signals , assuming prior knowledge of the pr transmit power .",
    "however , if a frequency - division - duplex ( fdd ) mode is adopted by the pr ( i.e. , pr terminal transmits and receives over two different frequency bands ) , channel reciprocity between pr and cr terminals does not hold in general . as a result , estimating cr - to - pr channels from the observed pr signals may fail for the cr .",
    "motivated by the above discussions , this paper presents a new design paradigm for ss - based crs , which resolves the cr - to - pr channel estimation problem for the cr , and also leads to a more efficient spectrum sharing solution than the conventional one with fixed itcs .",
    "the proposed method exploits an interesting pr - cr interaction by assuming that the pr deploys certain form of transmit power and/or rate adaptations upon receiving an interference signal from the cr . specifically , suppose that the cr initially transmits a probing signal to interfere with the pr receiver , which then sends back a control signal ( via the pr feedback channel ) to the pr transmitter for adapting transmit power and/or rate accordingly ; finally , the pr transmit adaptations are observed by the cr .",
    "thereby , the cr obtains knowledge on the pr deployed strategy for transmit adaptations without the need of a dedicated feedback channel from the pr .",
    "this implicit form of feedback from the pr to cr is thus named as _ hidden pr feedback_.",
    "since the cr initiatively sends a probing signal to interfere with the pr for activating the hidden pr feedback , this `` active learning '' principle is different from existing `` passive learning '' counterpart ( e.g. , detecting the pr on - off status or estimating the cr - to - pr channel gain via sensing the pr band only ) for the design of cr systems .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the probing signal from the cr can cause a temporary performance degradation of the pr , and thus needs to be properly designed ( details will be given later in the paper ) .",
    "the use of active learning approach for designing new spectrum sensing techniques for osa - based crs have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , while in this paper we apply this interesting approach to design new learning and transmission schemes for ss - based crs .",
    "it is worth noting that although iteratively adapting transmit power and rate to cope with the co - channel interference among users in decentralized communication systems has been studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the approach of exploiting the pr transmit adaptations to design new operation schemes for the cr is a new contribution of this paper . based on the hidden pr feedback , this paper proposes two new types of operations for ss - based crs , which are described as follows .    *",
    "_ active learning _ : by probing the pr with interference and observing its transmit power / rate adaptations , under certain conditions , the cr is able to estimate the channel gain from its transmitter to the pr receiver , which is essential for the cr to control its interference to the pr during subsequent data transmission . we refer to this new scheme for the cr as _ active learning _ , to differ it from existing passive learning schemes in the literature . * _ supervised transmission _ : with the acquired knowledge on the cr - to - pr channel gain and the pr transmit adaptations from active learning , the cr is able to design a _ supervised data transmission _ via controlling the interference power levels both to and from the pr .",
    "thus , the cr ensures that the resultant performance degradation of the pr is within a tolerable margin , and the cr achievable rate is optimized under the `` feedback '' interference from the pr , which is in general coupled with the cr transmit power due to the cr - to - pr interference and the resultant pr power adaptation .",
    "this paper proposes a new transmission protocol for the cr to implement active learning , together with solutions to deal with various important practical issues such as time discrepancy between the pr and cr links , cr rate estimation granularity and power measurement noise , and pr / cr channel variations .",
    "this paper also analyzes the pr and cr jointly achievable rates with the cr supervised transmission .",
    "moreover , this paper evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed cr learning and transmission schemes when the pr employs different transmit power / rate adaptation schemes over the fading channels @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] presents the system model .",
    "section [ sec : pr feedback ] describes the hidden pr feedback with different pr transmit adaptation strategies .",
    "section [ sec : learning ] presents the active learning method for the cr to estimate the cr - to - pr channel gain , a protocol to implement this method and various solutions to deal with practical issues .",
    "section [ sec : cr transmission ] studies the cr supervised data transmission by analyzing the achievable rates of both the pr and cr links .",
    "section [ sec : numerical examples ] provides numerical examples to corroborate the proposed studies .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig : system model ] , for the purpose of exposition , this paper considers a simplified spectrum sharing system , where one cr link consisting of a cr transmitter ( cr - tx ) and a cr receiver ( cr - rx ) shares a narrow - band for transmission with one pr link consisting of a pr transmitter ( pr - tx ) and a pr receiver ( pr - rx ) .",
    "all the terminals involved are assumed to be each equipped with a single antenna .",
    "we assume a block - fading channel model for all the channels shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] .",
    "we also assume coherent communication for both the pr and cr links and thus only the fading channel power gain ( amplitude square ) is of interest .",
    "in addition , since the proposed study in this paper applies to any particular channel fading state , for notational brevity , we drop the channel fading state index for the following definitions . denote @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 as the power gains of the channels from cr - tx to cr - rx , from pr - tx to pr - rx , from cr - tx to pr - rx , and from pr - tx to cr - rx , respectively .",
    "in addition , denote @xmath4 as the channel power gain from pr - tx to cr - tx . without loss of generality",
    ", it is assumed that the additive noises at both pr - rx and cr - rx are independent circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variables with zero mean and variances denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "first , consider the pr link .",
    "it is assumed that the pr is oblivious to the existence of the cr and treats the interference from cr - tx as additional noise at the receiver .",
    "we assume that the pr employs certain form of transmit power and/or rate adaptations based upon the pr csi as well as the interference power level received from the cr .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the noise - plus - interference power level at pr - rx , i.e. , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting the transmit power of the cr .",
    "the pr transmit power , denoted by @xmath10 , is then given by @xmath11 , which defines a mapping from the pr `` effective '' channel power gain , @xmath12 , to @xmath10 .",
    "the pr is assumed to employ packet - based transmissions and the transmit rate of one particular packet is denoted by @xmath13 . for a given pair of @xmath14 and @xmath10 , @xmath13 is assumed equal to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 denoting the signal - to - noise ( including both the additive noise and cr interference ) ratio ( snr ) at pr - rx .",
    "note that the rate function @xmath15 is specified by the employed modulation and coding scheme ( mcs ) of the pr link .",
    "next , consider the cr link .",
    "the cr is assumed to be aware of the pr , and furthermore protect the pr transmission by ensuring that the resultant performance loss of the pr due to the cr interference is within a tolerable margin .",
    "however , we consider a practical scenario where there is no dedicated communication channel for the pr to send any side information ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) to the cr for facilitating its interference control to the pr . consequently , the cr needs to fulfil the task of protecting the pr by its own effort . in this case ,",
    "one possible method for the cr is to deploy spectrum sensing techniques to detect the pr on - off status , and then transmit if the sensing result indicates that the pr is not transmitting with a high probability ( i.e. , osa - based crs ) .",
    "in contrast , this paper studies more efficient methods for the cr to utilize the pr spectrum than sensing - based orthogonal transmission , where the cr manages to transmit even when the pr is transmitting over the same band ( i.e. , ss - based crs ) .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the phenomenon of hidden pr feedback .",
    "first , consider for the pr link the following three commonly adopted power control policies in wireless communication :    * _ constant power ( cp ) policy _ : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant ; * _ persistent power control policy _ : @xmath19 , for any @xmath20 ; * _ non - persistent power control policy _ : @xmath21 , for any @xmath20 .",
    "the cp policy is usually applied when pr - tx has a strict peak power constraint given by @xmath18 over all transmitted packets , while the other two policies are applicable when pr - tx is subject to an average power constraint and thus can change transmit powers over different packets .",
    "note that with the _ persistent _ power control , @xmath10 usually increases when the effective channel power gain , @xmath14 , decreases .",
    "this type of power control is usually applied for data traffic with a stringent quality - of - service ( qos ) requirement in terms of receiver snr , @xmath16 .",
    "one well - known example in the literature for the persistent power control is the so - called _ truncated channel inversion _ ( tci ) @xcite , .",
    "alternatively , tci is non - persistent for all values of @xmath14 in the special case of @xmath22 , where tci reduces to the conventional _ channel inversion _ power control @xcite . ] which is expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the given snr target , while @xmath25 is the threshold for @xmath14 below which the pr decides to take a `` transmit outage '' , i.e. , @xmath26 and thus @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath25 can be determined from the pr average transmit power constraint and is related to the pr outage probability @xcite ( details are omitted here for brevity ) . with the tci power control ,",
    "the pr transmits with a constant rate @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , with the _ non - persistent _ power control , the pr usually decreases its transmit power when @xmath14 decreases , in order to save transmit powers for better opportunities with larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "one well - known example for the non - persistent power control is the so - called _ water - filling _ ( wf ) @xcite policy , which is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant , or the so - called `` water - level '' , which can be determined from the pr average transmit power constraint @xcite ( details are omitted here ) .",
    "the wf power control results in a variable - rate transmission for the pr , where @xmath32 if @xmath33 ; and @xmath27 otherwise .    from the above discussions ,",
    "it is observed that @xmath10 and/or @xmath13 may vary with the values of @xmath14 . since @xmath34 for a given fading state with fixed channel power gains @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it follows that @xmath14 is solely determined by transmit power of the cr signal , @xmath9 .",
    "more specifically , we can express @xmath10 and @xmath13 in terms of @xmath9 for cp , tci , and wf power control of the pr as follows .",
    "@xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr rate power ] , @xmath10 and @xmath13 are plotted as functions of @xmath9 , for the cp , tci ( assuming @xmath38 ) , and wf ( assuming @xmath39 ) power control of the pr , respectively . for the purpose of illustration ,",
    "in this example we assume that @xmath40 , which holds when the optimal gaussian codebook is used by the pr with interference from the cr treated as additive gaussian noise .",
    "as observed , by interfering with the pr with @xmath41 , the cr is usually able to make the pr change its transmit power and/or rate for all considered pr power control policies . as a result , the corresponding changes occur in the received pr signal power , @xmath42 , and/or rate , @xmath13 , at cr - tx",
    ". therefore , there exists a _ hidden _ pr power and/or rate feedback observable by the cr , which is activated by the cr via initiatively interfering with the pr . in the following , we will apply this hidden pr feedback phenomenon to design new learning and transmission schemes for the cr .",
    "in this section , we apply the hidden pr feedback to design cr active learning with the goal of estimating the channel power gain from cr - tx to pr - rx , @xmath2 , which is essential for the cr to control the interference to the pr during data transmission as discussed later in section [ sec : cr transmission ] .",
    "first , we present the proposed scheme for the ideal case with a number of assumptions made . then",
    ", we present a protocol for the cr to implement the proposed scheme and the solutions to deal with important issues for implementation with relaxed assumptions .      in this subsection , we propose a new scheme for cr - tx to estimate @xmath2 via active learning ( i.e. , without the need of a feedback channel from pr - rx ) under certain assumptions listed as follows .    *",
    "the cr knows the pr transmission protocol and is able to synchronize its operation with the pr transmission . * in the case where the cr needs to extract rate information from the received pr signal , this can be done by the cr via certain techniques .",
    "furthermore , the pr transmit rate , @xmath15 , is a continuously increasing function of the receiver snr , @xmath43 , and this function is known to the cr . * in the case where the cr needs to estimate the received signal power from the pr , the effect of the receiver noise on the power estimation is ignored .",
    "* during the period for the proposed scheme to be implemented , all the channels involved in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] remain constant .",
    "the above assumptions will be relaxed in the next subsection where implementation issues for the proposed scheme are addressed .",
    "next , we present the scheme to estimate @xmath2 as follows .",
    "suppose that initially cr - tx listens to the pr transmission , using the method presented in this paper , while the one between them that has a superior channel quality from pr - tx is more suitable for this task . for simplicity",
    ", this paper assumes that this task is done by cr - tx . ] and observes the received signal power and rate from pr - tx , represented by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , with @xmath46 denoting the initial transmit power of the pr and @xmath47 .",
    "next , cr - tx broadcasts a probing signal of power @xmath9 , and pr - rx reacts upon receiving the interference from cr - tx by sending back to pr - tx ( via a dedicated feedback channel for the pr link ) a control signal to indicate transmit power and/or rate adaptation .",
    "accordingly , pr - tx resets transmit power and rate to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , where @xmath48 depends on the employed power control policy @xmath50 of the pr and @xmath51 with @xmath52 . as a result , cr - tx observes the updated power received from pr - tx , @xmath53 , and the updated transmit rate of the pr , @xmath49 . under the aforementioned assumptions , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath49 are all perfectly observed by cr - tx .    without loss of generality",
    ", it can be assumed that in the above proposed scheme , @xmath57 and thus @xmath58 .",
    "this is so because if @xmath59 , the pr does not transmit initially , and thus the cr can simply transmit as if the pr is not present and the estimation of @xmath2 becomes unnecessary in this case .",
    "furthermore , note that if @xmath57 , there always exists a non - trivial interval of @xmath9 for which @xmath60 .",
    "this is obvious with e.g. , cp policy of the pr since @xmath61 regardless of @xmath9 , while with tci power control , from ( [ eq : tci ] ) it follows that @xmath57 implies that @xmath62 and thus @xmath63 provided that @xmath64 ; and with wf power control , from ( [ eq : wf ] ) it follows that @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 and thus @xmath63 provided that @xmath67 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can also assume that @xmath68 ( if not , the cr can re - probe the pr with a smaller power @xmath9 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "note that the observed @xmath49 contains side information on @xmath2 to be estimated via the term @xmath71 .",
    "however , @xmath2 can not be determined solely from @xmath49 since other relevant terms , @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and @xmath48 are unknown to the cr .",
    "interestingly , cr - tx can determine @xmath72 from the observed @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath49 , and the probing signal power @xmath9 , as shown in the following proposition .",
    "[ proposition : channel estimation ] assuming that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath49 are all strictly positive , the channel power gain from cr - tx to pr - rx @xmath2 normalized to the noise power at pr - rx @xmath5 can be estimated as @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the inverse function of @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 and from the expressions of @xmath55 and @xmath49 , it follows that @xmath77 using ( [ eq : equality 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : equality 2 ] ) , ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) can be obtained .",
    "we see that proposition [ proposition : channel estimation ] is mainly based upon the `` hidden '' equation in ( [ eq : equality 3 ] ) , which is due to the pr transmit self - adaptation upon receiving the interference from the cr .",
    "note that the method given in proposition [ proposition : channel estimation ] applies to any general pr transmit power / rate adaptation strategy , provided that at least one of the pr transmit power and rate is changed after receiving interference from the cr . in the two special cases of cp and tci power control policies for the pr",
    ", for which @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , it easily follows that the estimation rule in ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) reduces to @xmath80 therefore , only rate / power adaptation of the pr needs to be observed by the cr for the estimation of @xmath72 in the case of cp / tci power control for the pr .",
    "note that the proposed new method for the cr to estimate @xmath2 works in both cases of tdd and fdd modes for the pr .",
    "for comparison , consider the conventional method where cr - tx estimates @xmath2 from the received signal power from pr - rx ( when it transmits ) , denoted by @xmath81 , with @xmath82 denoting the channel power gain from pr - rx to cr - tx and @xmath83 denoting the instantaneous transmit power of pr - rx .",
    "in contrast , the proposed method estimates @xmath2 at either cr - tx or cr - rx based on the received signals from pr - tx .",
    "there are three major advantages of the proposed method over the conventional method .",
    "first , for the conventional method , even in the case of pr tdd mode where channel reciprocity holds such that @xmath84 , @xmath2 can be estimated only if @xmath83 is known at cr - tx , which may not hold in practice . in contrast , from ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) it is observed that the proposed method does not rely on the knowledge of pr transmit power .",
    "second , the assumption @xmath84 for the conventional method becomes problematic if fdd mode is used for the pr , since @xmath82 and @xmath2 now correspond to two different frequency bands and are thus different in general . in contrast , the proposed method works independent of the relationship between @xmath82 and @xmath2 .",
    "third , the conventional method may estimate @xmath2 but can not give any information on the noise power at pr - rx , @xmath5 ; as a result , cr - tx can not predict its resulting interference power level at pr - rx relative to @xmath5 . in contrast , the proposed method provides the direct estimate on @xmath72 .      in this subsection , we address various implementation issues for the proposed active learning scheme .",
    "first , we present the transmission protocols for the pr and cr as follows .",
    "* _ pr transmission protocol _ : we consider the conventional pilot - training - based transmission protocol for the pr , where the transmission of pr - tx is divided into orthogonal time blocks , each of which is further divided into two sub - blocks : one contains the training signal and the other contains the data signal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol](a ) .",
    "the training signal is for pr - rx to estimate the pr channel @xmath1 as well as the received noise power @xmath8 ( including the received cr interference power if @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is assumed that these estimates are perfect since in this paper we focus on the deign of cr transmission .",
    "based on the estimated @xmath1 and @xmath7 , pr - rx computes the effective channel power gain @xmath12 , and according to @xmath14 designs a feedback signal for pr - tx to adapt its transmit power and/or rate for the next block transmission ( for simplicity , we assume that there is no delay or error for the pr feedback ) . *",
    "_ cr transmission protocol _ : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol](b ) , the transmission protocol for the cr is more sophisticated than the conventional pilot - training - based one for the pr .",
    "specifically , each cr block transmission consists of four stages : initial sensing , probing , re - sensing , and data transmission . for initial",
    "sensing , cr - tx observes the received pr signal power @xmath54 and/or rate @xmath55 .",
    "then , in the probing stage , cr - tx transmits a predesigned signal of power @xmath9 to interfere with pr - rx .",
    "the probing signal of cr - tx can also be used as the training signal for cr - rx .",
    "after that , cr - tx goes into the re - sensing stage to observe the updated pr signal power @xmath56 and/or rate @xmath49 , and estimates @xmath72 according to the rule given in ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) .",
    "last , based on the estimated channel and the observed pr transmit adaptations , cr - tx sets its transmit power and rate ( details are given later in section [ sec : cr transmission ] ) , and starts data transmission .",
    "next , we discuss the following important issues for implementing the above cr transmission protocol based on active learning .      one important issue for the proposed scheme is the timing discrepancy between the distributed pr and cr links due to the lack of a common reference clock .",
    "let @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 denote the propagation delays from pr - tx to pr - rx , from pr - tx to cr - tx , and from cr - tx to pr - rx , respectively , with @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath89 denote the transmitted signal from pr - tx .",
    "then , the received signals at pr - rx and cr - tx are @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( the channel multiplicative effect is ignored here since it is irrelevant to the discussion on time synchronization ) , respectively .",
    "since cr - tx does not have a common clock with pr - tx , it has to use the received signal from pr - tx as a reference clock .",
    "hence , the transmitted probing signal from cr - tx can be denoted as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the transmission time ahead of the reference clock ( to be specified later ) . accordingly , the received probing signal at pr - rx is @xmath94 .",
    "note that cr - tx needs to make sure that its probing signal arrives at pr - rx prior to the pr training signal in one particular transmission block , i.e. , @xmath95 , to make an effective probing .",
    "thus , it follows that @xmath96 .",
    "however , the exact values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 may not be known to cr - tx . instead",
    ", suppose that we know that the maximum propagation delay between cr and pr terminals is less than @xmath97 .",
    "then , by setting @xmath98 , it is ensured that the cr probing signal arrives at pr - rx prior to the pr training signal .    on the other hand",
    ", the duration of the probing signal from cr - tx , denoted by @xmath99 , also needs to be properly designed .",
    "note that in order to minimize the temporary performance degradation of the pr link due to the cr probing signal , it is desirable to choose a small value for @xmath99 .",
    "however , for the probing signal to be effective ,",
    "it is also necessary to make @xmath99 sufficiently large such that the probing signal can overlap with the entire training signal of the pr at pr - rx in one particular transmission block .",
    "let @xmath100 denote the training signal duration of the pr , which is assumed known at cr - tx .",
    "from the earlier discussion on time synchronization , we know that pr - rx observes the pr signal , @xmath101 , and cr probing signal , @xmath102 . thus , the maximal gap for the arrival time of the cr probing signal ahead of that of the pr training signal is @xmath103 when @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , by setting @xmath105 , the aforementioned requirements for choosing @xmath99 are both fulfilled .      in the estimation rule given by ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] )",
    ", it has been assumed that the transmit rate of the pr , @xmath15 , is a continuous function of receiver snr , @xmath43 .",
    "however , with practical mcss , @xmath15 is usually a non - decreasing function of @xmath43 with a finite rate granularity , i.e. , constituting only a finite number of discrete rate values . in this case , suppose that @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 denotes a discrete rate value , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are corresponding snr thresholds . in this case , although the cr can not determine the exact value of @xmath72 from ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) , it can safely estimate the range of this value as @xmath112      another assumption we have made on the estimation using ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) is that the sensor noise at cr - tx is ignored for estimating the received pr signal powers , @xmath54 and @xmath56 , before and after the cr probing . in practice ,",
    "only a finite number of pr signal samples can be obtained during the initial sensing and re - sensing periods at cr - tx , which are corrupted by the receiver noise . for convenience , we assume that the noise power at cr - tx is @xmath6 , the same as that at cr - rx , and @xmath6 is known to cr - tx .",
    "also assume that @xmath113 independent signal samples are obtained during both the initial sensing and re - sensing periods at cr - tx , denoted by @xmath114 , @xmath108 .",
    "specifically , we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the pr signal component , with @xmath117 , and @xmath118 s are independent gaussian noises with zero mean and variance of @xmath6 . instead of having the exact values for @xmath54 and @xmath56",
    ", we can obtain their estimated values as follows .",
    "@xmath119    according to the central limit theorem @xcite , if the number of samples @xmath113 is large enough ( e.g. , @xmath120 in practice ) , the above estimation statistics are asymptotically normally distributed with corresponding mean @xmath121 and variance @xmath122 since @xmath123 s are unknown at cr - tx , the exact values of @xmath124 s are not available at cr - tx . however ,",
    "if it is known that the pr transmit powers must be below a prescribed maximum value , denoted by @xmath125 , the upper bounds for @xmath124 s can be obtained as @xmath126 thus , it follows that @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the complementary cumulative distribution function @xcite , and @xmath129 is a design parameter .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath130 in other words , we have a belief in probability of at least @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "accordingly , from ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) , it follows that with a probability of at least @xmath131 @xmath134 similarly , with the same probability guarantee , we have @xmath135 note that in ( [ eq : channel gain estimate new ub ] ) and ( [ eq : channel gain estimate new lb ] ) , we have assumed that @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "thus , even with a finite number of observation samples corrupted by additive noises , cr - tx can still obtain a pair of upper and lower bounds on @xmath72 with a large belief probability ( by setting a sufficiently large value for @xmath138 ) .",
    "however , if the chosen @xmath138 is too large , it also increases the uncertainty range for the estimation .",
    "last , we address the issue on possible channel variations during the implementation of the proposed cr active learning scheme .",
    "it is worth noting that the assumption of constant channels has usually been made in prior works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) on iterative user power / rate adaptations in decentralized multiuser systems . from the proof of proposition [",
    "proposition : channel estimation ] , we see that if the channel power gain , @xmath4 , through which cr - tx estimates the received signal powers @xmath54 and @xmath56 from pr - tx , changes from the initial sensing stage to the re - sensing stage , the estimation result will get affected .",
    "let @xmath139 and @xmath140 denote the true values of @xmath4 during the initial sensing and re - sensing periods , respectively .",
    "we can rewrite the estimation rule in ( [ eq : channel gain estimate ] ) as ( assuming the perfect rate and power estimation ) @xmath141 although cr - tx does not know the exact values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 , it can predict the approximate range for their ratio given the channel coherence time relative to the time interval between the initial sensing and re - seining stages , and obtain the corresponding upper and lower bounds on the estimated value from ( [ eq : estimate channel variation ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the channel power gain @xmath2 from cr - tx to pr - rx may also change from the probing stage to the data transmission stage .",
    "similarly as for @xmath4 , given the channel coherence time and the time interval between these two stages , cr - tx can estimate the range of @xmath2 accordingly .",
    "in the previous section , we have proposed an active learning scheme for the cr to estimate the channel gain from cr - tx to pr - rx by exploiting the hidden pr feedback . in this section , we design supervised transmission for cr data transmission stage shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : protocol](b ) , based on the acquired knowledge from active learning . in the following , we address two main design objectives for cr supervised transmission : controlling the pr link performance degradation and maximizing the cr link throughput .      in this subsection , we illustrate how to apply the estimated cr - to - pr channel gain from active learning for cr - tx to predict the performance loss of the pr link due to cr data transmission . for simplicity , we assume that the estimation of @xmath72 is perfect at cr - tx , although the obtained results can be easily extended to the case of imperfect channel estimation by utilizing the derived estimation bounds in section [ subsec : implementation ] .",
    "we consider two general types of performance losses for the pr link : one is for the case where the pr employs variable - rate transmission ( e.g. , with cp or wf power control ) , named as _ rate penalty _ , which measures the pr rate loss due to the cr interference , expressed as @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the resultant pr transmit rate in the cr data transmission stage ; the other is for the case where the pr employs constant - rate transmission ( e.g. , with tci power control ) , named as _ power penalty _ , which measures the additional transmit power in db required for the pr to maintain the prescribed constant rate @xmath55 under the cr interference , expressed as @xmath144 , where @xmath145 denotes the resultant pr transmit power in the cr data transmission stage .",
    "note that @xmath55 and @xmath46 denote the pr transmit rate and power without the cr interference , respectively , in the cr initial sensing stage .",
    "let @xmath146 denote the cr transmit power in the data transmission stage .",
    "first , the rate penalty for the pr link can be more explicitly expressed as @xmath147 note that for the convenience of analysis , we have assumed the `` snr gap approximation '' that accounts for the rate loss from the optimal capacity due to practical / non - gaussian mcs employed by the pr @xcite , i.e. , @xmath148 , where @xmath149 denotes the constant snr gap for the pr .    in the case of cp policy for the pr , from ( [ eq : rate loss ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath150 therefore , cr - tx knows that if it transmits with power @xmath146 , the resultant rate loss of the pr is upper - bounded by the value given in ( [ eq : rate loss ub ] ) , which depends on the estimated @xmath72 , but is independent of the pr transmit power @xmath18 and snr gap @xmath151 .",
    "consider next the case of wf power control for the pr similarly as that given in ( [ eq : wf ] ) but with @xmath14 therein replaced by @xmath152 . in this case , assuming that @xmath69 ( otherwise the rate penalty for the pr is trivially zero ) , from ( [ eq : rate loss ] ) @xmath153 can be further expressed as @xmath154 it thus follows that @xmath155 thus , cr - tx can predict the exact rate loss of the pr as a function of @xmath146 , based on the estimated @xmath72 and @xmath55 from the active learning .",
    "last , consider the power penalty of the pr with the tci power control given in ( [ eq : tci ] ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath156 , i.e. , the cr interference power is not sufficiently large to render the pr into a transmit outage ( otherwise the power penalty of the pr becomes irrelevant ) , it thus follows that @xmath157 thus , cr - tx can measure the power penalty of the pr as a function of @xmath146 .    from the above discussions , we see that the derived rate and power penalties enable cr - tx to predict quantitatively the resultant pr performance losses corresponding to different transmit power levels of the cr , using only the observed / estimated parameters from the active learning .      in the previous subsection ,",
    "we have shown for the cr supervised transmission how to control the resultant pr link performance degradation . with a given pr rate / power penalty",

    "it is interesting to observe that in general the cr achievable rate is related to the cr transmit power @xmath146 not only through the direct link from cr - tx to cr - rx , but also through the interference link from cr - tx to pr - rx , the resultant pr power adaptation and `` feedback '' interference from pr - tx to cr - rx .",
    "thus , cr - tx is able to control the interference power from pr - tx by changing transmit power @xmath146 via the hidden pr feedback .    with the pr feedback interference",
    ", some interesting observations can be drawn for the cr achievable rate as a function of @xmath146 .",
    "note that without the pr interference , @xmath161 is an increasing function of @xmath146 .",
    "however , with the pr feedback interference , the interference power from pr - tx can also be an increasing function of @xmath146 in the case of persistent power control for the pr ( e.g. , tci ) .",
    "as a result , it is unclear in this case whether increasing the cr transmit power will result in a net gain for its achievable rate .",
    "thus , it is pertinent to investigate further on @xmath161 for the cr link under the pr feedback interference , as shown in the following proposition .",
    "[ proposition : sud ] for any @xmath162 under which @xmath11 with @xmath163 is a positive , continuous and differentiable function of @xmath14 , @xmath164 if and only if @xmath165 , where @xmath166    the proof of proposition [ proposition : sud ] follows from ( [ eq : rate sud ] ) and is thus omitted here for brevity . it is noted that cp and wf power control policies for the pr satisfy the condition given in proposition [ proposition : sud ] straightforwardly , since they are both non - persistent power control . for the tci power control of the cr which is persistent ,",
    "it can be verified ( details are omitted here for brevity ) that @xmath167 , for all values of @xmath162 as required in proposition [ proposition : sud ] .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath161 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath146 in all cases of cp , wf , or tci power control policies for the pr .",
    "in this section , we present numerical examples to validate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes for cr active learning and supervised transmission . it is assumed that @xmath168 and @xmath169 in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that all these channels are constant over the pr and cr transmission blocks where the proposed cr schemes are implemented .",
    "we evaluate the performance for the cr - to - pr channel gain estimation based on active learning , as well as the pr performance degradation control and cr achievable rate with cr supervised transmission .",
    "we consider the following two scenarios : _ case i _ : the pr employs a constant - power ( cp ) variable - rate transmission ; and _ case ii _ :",
    "the pr employs a constant - rate variable - power ( with tci power control ) transmission . for convenience , we assume that @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .    consider first case i , where the pr transmits with a constant power @xmath172 . in this case",
    ", we are interested in investigating the effects of finite rate granularity for the pr variable - rate transmission on the performances of the cr active learning and supervised transmission .",
    "suppose that the pr transmit rate for a given effective channel gain @xmath14 is expressed as @xmath173 in bps / hz , where @xmath174 denotes the floor operation ; and @xmath175 denotes the `` bit granularity '' due to the fact that practical mcs only supports a finite set of discrete transmit rates corresponding to integer multiplications of @xmath176 .",
    "we assume that @xmath177db and @xmath178 ( i.e. , one - bit granularity ) . from ( [ eq : channel gain estimate bounds ] )",
    ", it follows that the upper and lower bounds on @xmath2 in the case of one - bit granularity are obtained as @xmath179 where @xmath55 and @xmath49 denote the discrete rates of the pr observed by the cr in the sensing and re - sensing stages , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr cp](a ) , we show the estimated upper and lower bounds for @xmath2 using the above estimation rule .",
    "it is observed that with small value of cr probing signal power @xmath9 , the gap between the estimated upper and lower bounds for @xmath2 is large , suggesting that the estimation of @xmath2 is not accurate .",
    "this is due to the fact that if @xmath9 is too small , the interference at pr - rx is not sufficiently strong to make the pr reduce its transmit rate by at least one bit ( note that @xmath178 ) , and as a result , the cr observes the same value of @xmath49 as @xmath55 .",
    "however , with larger value of @xmath9 , the cr is able to make @xmath180 and thus obtain a more accurate estimation for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , there is in general a tradeoff between minimizing the pr performance degradation and the cr - to - pr channel estimation error for the cr active learning . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr cp](b ) and [ fig : pr cp](c ) , we show the pr rate penalty and cr achievable rate , respectively , vs. cr transmit power @xmath146 for cr supervised data transmission .",
    "it is observed that both the pr rate penalty and cr transmit rate increase with @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , in fig . [",
    "fig : pr cp](b ) , we compare the actual resultant pr rate penalty ( with one - bit granularity ) to its estimated value using ( [ eq : rate loss ub ] ) and the estimated upper bound on @xmath2 from active learning with @xmath181 .",
    "it is observed that the estimated pr rate penalties are indeed valid upper bounds on their true values for different values of @xmath146 .",
    "it is worth comparing the spectrum - sharing performance for the pr and cr links with the proposed active learning and supervised transmission for the cr , with the approach ( refereed to as `` no feedback '' ) without exploiting the pr hidden feedback , or the approach ( refereed to as `` perfect feedback '' ) with the perfect knowledge of the cr - to - pr channel via a dedicated feedback channel from pr - rx to cr - tx .",
    "note that for all three design approaches , the achievable rates for the cr with a given transmit power @xmath146 are identical , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr cp](c ) .",
    "however , the main differences among these designs are highlighted as follows .",
    "for the case of `` no feedback '' , the cr has no means to predict the pr performance loss as a function of @xmath146 and thus can not deploy any opportunistic transmission ; as a result , the cr has to transmit constantly with a very low power and thus results in low spectral efficiency .",
    "in contrast , with the new proposed design , the cr can always predict its maximum transmit power given the pr transmission margin and decide its transmit rate accordingly . on the other hand , for the case of `` perfect feedback '' , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr cp](b ) , for a given pr rate penalty value , the cr with the perfect channel knowledge can transmit with a larger power than the proposed design with active learning based channel estimation , and thus the maximum achievable rate for the cr also becomes larger ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pr cp](b ) & [ fig : pr cp](c ) ) .",
    "next , consider case ii , where the pr transmits with a constant rate or equivalently maintains a constant receiver snr , @xmath182 .",
    "thus , the tci power control given in ( [ eq : tci ] ) is used by the pr with @xmath183 .",
    "in this case , we are interested in investigating the effects of a finite number of observation samples and receiver noise at cr - tx for estimating the received pr signal powers on the performances of cr active learning and supervised transmission . from ( [ eq : channel gain estimate new ub ] ) and ( [ eq : channel gain estimate new lb ] ) , it follows that the upper and lower bounds on @xmath2 in the case of a finite number of observed pr signal samples are obtained as @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 denote the observed powers at cr - tx in the sensing and re - sensing stages , respectively . in order to keep the estimated @xmath2 within the above range with a probability guarantee of @xmath187 , we choose @xmath188 since @xmath189 .",

    "similar to our previous observations for fig .",
    "[ fig : pr cp](a ) , it is observed that the cr probing power @xmath9 needs to be sufficiently large in order to make a reasonably good estimate on @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr tci](b ) and [ fig : pr tci](c ) , we show the pr power penalty and cr achievable rate , respectively , vs. cr transmit power @xmath146 for cr supervised data transmission .",

    "this is because for fig .",
    "[ fig : pr tci](c ) , the pr employs tci power control instead of cp as for fig .",
