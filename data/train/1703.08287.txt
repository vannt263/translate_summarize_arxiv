    "understanding the transport properties of bismuth(bi ) has long been a major aim in the field of condensed matter physics .",
    "the anomalous transport properties occur in this material , originating from its semimetallic electronic structures@xcite , in which electron and hole carriers coexist .",
    "in addition , the bi atom has a strong spin - orbit interaction(soi ) originating from its high atomic number(83 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that various relativistic effects apply , such as the rashba effect@xcite , the quantum spin hall effect@xcite , and conversion between the spin and charge currents@xcite .",
    "bi films are expected to be suitable for device application@xcite as it has been shown that flat thin films can be grown on a si ( 111 ) surface . in this case , the surface state differs strongly from the bulk state ; that is the surface density of states is significantly larger than that of the bulk states@xcite . as a result of the strong soi within the electronic structures ,",
    "spintronic applications are expected .",
    "recent angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite have revealed the novel spin textures of the surface states of bi thin films .",
    "the conventional rashba ( in - plane ) spin texture and a giant out - of - spin component are detected .",
    "the spin texture has been analyzed using the tight - binding model@xcite ; quantitative analysis of the spin textures based on the first - principles calculations has not been conducted .    in this paper , we conduct a theoretical quantitative investigation of the surface states of bi ( 111 ) multi - layer nanofilm based on the fermi lines . using fully relativistic first - principles density functional calculations , we perform quantitative analysis for the surface localized spin vortexes on the fermi lines of the bi thin film .",
    "our calculation supports the experimentally observed large out - of - plane spin component .",
    "further , we find that the rashba parameter @xmath2 of these bands is large ( approximately 1.9 @xmath3 0.1 ev ) . +",
    "using the openmx code@xcite , we perform fully relativistic first - principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite . in our study , wavefunctions are expressed as a linear combination of multiple pseudo atomic orbitals ( lcpao ) generated by a confinement scheme@xcite .",
    "we deduce the spin polarization in the reciprocal lattice vector * k * from the spin density matrix .",
    "the spin density matrices @xmath4 are calculated using the spinor bloch wavefunction , the component of which is given by @xmath5 , which is obtained from the openmx calculations , where @xmath6 is the spin index ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the band index .",

    "further , each bilayer forms a honeycomb lattice and has 1.6  - buckling .",
    "we confirm that the fermi lines are insensitive to the thickness when more than 13 bilayer films are used .",
    "+ in the 20-bilayer slab calculation , the interaction between the two surfaces is expected to be very weak and can be neglected .",
    "as the slab has inversion symmetry , the kramers degenerate bands appear . because of the weak interaction between two surfaces , unitary transformation of the two bands generates to wavefunctions that are localized at each surface . by analyzing the wavefunctions ,",
    "we can obtain information on the surface states .",

    "the surface localization ratio is represented by the circle radius proportional to the number of electrons within the surface-1bilayer . near the fermi level @xmath21 along the @xmath22-@xmath23 line ,",
    "two surface - localized bands appear .",
    "the surface bands are connected to the bulk - like bands around the @xmath23 point near the @xmath21 , at which states the bands have small amplitude on the surface layer .",
    "the bulk - like bands originate from the hole pocket at the @xmath24 point in the bulk structure bi on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) , the surface localized states at the @xmath23 point are buried in the bulk - like state in the region of @xmath25  -  @xmath21= -0.32 ev , where @xmath25 is band energy .",
    "more than 50% of these states are localized in the surface 1-bilayer .",
    "these bands cross at the @xmath23 point , and the energy contours form circular shape . in addition , the spin texture indicated by these bands corresponds to a typical in - plane spin vortex .",
    "these features appear to conform to a typical rashba band .",
    "we estimate the rashba parameter @xmath2 from the gradient of these bands .",
    "the estimated @xmath2 is 1.9 @xmath3 0.1 ev@xmath26 , which is very large and is of the same order as the value obtained for other bismuth compounds ( e.g. , bitei has @xmath2 = 3.8ev@xmath26  @xcite ) .",
