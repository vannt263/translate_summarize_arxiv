    "the drawdown of a given process is the distance of the current value away from the maximum value it has attained to date .",
    "similarly , the drawup of a given process is defined as the current rise of the present value over the running minimum .",
    "both of them have been customarily used as dynamic risk measures .",
    "in fact , drawdown process does not only provide dynamic measures of risk , but can also be viewed as measures of relative regret .",
    "similarly drawup process can be viewed as measures of relative satisfaction .",
    "thus , a drawdown or a drawup of a certain number may signal the time when investor may choose to change his / her investment position , which depends on his / her perception of future moves of the market and his / her risk aversion .",
    "the interest in drawdown asset has been strongly raised by recent financial crisis .",
    "large market drawdown may bring portfolio losses , liquidity shocks and even future recessions .",
    "therefore risk management of drawdown has become so important among practitioners ; see e.g. @xcite for portfolio optimization under constraints on the drawdown process , @xcite for the distribution of the maximum drawdown of drifted brownian motion and time - adjusted measure of performance known as the calmar ratio and @xcite for drawdown process as dynamic measure of risk . for an overview of the existing techniques for analysis of market crashes as well as a collection of empirical studies of the drawdown process and the maximum drawdown process",
    ", please refer to sornette @xcite .",
    "it is then natural that fund managers have strong incentive to seek insurance against drawdown .",
    "in fact , as works of @xcite argue , some market - traded contracts , such as vanilla and look - back puts , have only limited ability to insure the market drawdown",
    ". therefore the drawdown protection can be useful also for individual investors .    in this paper",
    "we follow zhang et al . @xcite pricing some insurance contracts against drawdown ( and drawup ) events of log - returns of stock price modeled by exponential lvy process and identifying the optimal stopping rules .",
    "we also identify for these contracts so - called fair premium rates for which contracts prices equal zero .",
    "in its simplest form , the first drawdown insurance contract involves a continuous premium payment by the investor ( protection buyer ) to insure a drawdown of log - returns of the underlying asset over a pre - specified level . possible buyer of this insurance contract might think that it is unlikely to get large drawdown and he / she might want to stop paying the premium . therefore we expand the simplest contract by adding cancellable feature . in this case , the investor receives right to terminate the contract earlier and in this case he / she pay penalty for doing so .",
    "we show that the investor s optimal cancellable time is based on the first passage time of the drawdown of log - return process .",
    "moreover , we also consider a related insurance contract that protects the investor from a drawdown of log - return of the asset price preceding a drawup related with it .",
    "in other words , the insurance contract expires early if a drawup event occurs prior to a drawdown . from the investors perspective , when a drawup is realized , there is little need to insure against a drawdown .",
    "therefore , this drawup contingency automatically stops the premium payment and it is an attractive feature that could potentially reduce the cost of the drawdown insurance .",
    "finally , we also added cancellable feature to this contract .",
    "zhang et al . @xcite considered only a risky asset modeled by the geometric brownian motion . however , in recent years , empirical study of financial data reveals the fact that the distribution of the log - return of stock price exhibits features which can not be captured by the normal distribution such as heavy tails and asymmetry . for the purpose of replicating more effectively these features and for reproducing a wide variety of implied volatility skews and smiles ,",
    "there has been a general shift in the literature to modeling a risky asset with an exponential lvy process as an alternative to exponential of a linear brownian motion ; see kyprianou @xcite and ksendal and sulem @xcite for overviews",
    ". therefore looking for a better fitting of the evolution of the stock price process to the real data , in this paper we price derivative securities in market by a general geometric spectrally negative lvy process .",
    "that is , logarithm of a risky asset in our case will be a process with stationary and independent increments with no positive jumps .",
    "the last contract analyzed in this paper taking into account drawdown and drawup with cancellable feature is considered for the first time in literature . at the same , although it is the most complex one , it produces very interesting and surprising results .",
    "in particular , we discover new phenomenon for optimal stopping contract rule in this contract . in the phenomenon , the investor s stopping rule is also at a first passage time of the drawdown of log - returns process , similarly like it is for the second contract without drawup contingency .",
    "still , the level of termination is different taking into account drawup event .",
    "our approach is based on the classical fluctuation theory for the spectrally negative lvy processes ( related with so - called scale functions ) and some new exit identities for reflected lvy processes .",
    "the latter ones identify two - sided exit problems for drawup and drawdown first passage times .",
    "a key element of our approach is path analysis and using some results of mijatovi and pistorius @xcite .",
    "we also heavily use optimal stopping theory . in a market where the underlying dynamics for the stock price process is driven by the exponential of a linear brownian motion the valuation is transformed into a free boundary problem .",
    "however , by allowing jumps to appear in the sample paths of the underlying dynamics of the stock price process , this idea breaks down . to tackle these infinite horizon problem we use the so - called , , guess and verify  method .",
    "for this method , one guesses what the optimal value function and optimal stopping should be and then tries to verify that this candidate solution is indeed the optimal one by putting it through a verification theorem .",
    "what is meant by the latter is that the value function identified by guessed stopping rule applied to the log - return price process constructs a smallest , in some sense , discounted supermartingale .    in this paper",
    "we also analyze many particular examples and give extensive numerical analysis showing the dependence of the contract and stopping time on the model s parameters .",
    "we focus mainly on the case when logarithm of the asset price is a linear brownian motion or drift minus compound poisson process ( so - called cramr - lundberg risk process ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : prel ] we introduce main definitions , notations and main fluctuation identities .",
    "we analyze insurance contracts based on drawdown and additional drawup in sections [ sec : drawdown ] and [ sec : drawup ] , respectively .",
    "we finish our paper by the numerical analysis performed in section [ sec : examples ] and conclusions in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "we work on complete filtered probability space @xmath2 satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "we model a logarithm of the underlying risky asset price @xmath3 by a spectrally negative lvy process @xmath4 , that is @xmath5 is a geometric lvy process .",
    "this means that @xmath4 is a stationary stochastic process with independent increments , right - continuous paths with left limits and has only negative jumps .",
    "many identities will be given in terms of so - called scale functions which are defined in following way .",
    "we start from defining so - called laplace exponent of @xmath4 : @xmath6\\ ] ] which is well defined for @xmath7 due to the absence of positive jumps .",
    "recall that by lvy - khintchine theorem : @xmath8 which is analytic for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real and @xmath12 is so - called lvy measure .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath13 is zero at the origin , tends to infinity at infinity and is strictly convex .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the right continuous inverse of @xmath13 so that it satisfies the following : @xmath15 for @xmath16 we define a continuous and strictly increasing function @xmath17 on @xmath18 with the laplace transform given by : @xmath19 where @xmath13 is a laplace exponent of @xmath4 given in .",
    "it is so - called the first scale function .",

    "this assumption is satisfied when the process @xmath4 has non - trivial gaussian component or it is of unbounded variation or the jumps have the density ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the drawdown is the difference between running maximum of the underlying process and its current value and the drawup is difference between process current value and its running minimum . here , we additionally assume that the drawdown and drawup processes start from some points @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath32 above the values @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be interpreted as historical maximum and historical minimum of process @xmath35 .",
