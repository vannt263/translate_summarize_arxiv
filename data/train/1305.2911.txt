    "the study of heat conduction in low dimensional systems has concentrated on one - dimensional lattices @xcite and simplified hamiltonian models that are amenable to solution @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian models often consist of energy storage devices which couple to each other through the motion of tracer particles that carry the energy .",
    "exceptions to this have been rare , but one of these is the study of particle based systems using hard disks by deutsch and narayan @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "the other common feature of these model systems is that the thermal reservoirs are stochastic and are thus sources of particles with velocities chosen from some distribution and the reservoir is not mechanically coupled to the system .",
    "this element of randomness has limited the approaches that could be used to study heat conduction as a dynamical system @xcite .    in 2007 a new deterministic thermal reservoir was introduced that coupled the quasi - one - dimensional system of hard disks to temperature reservoirs by changing the collision rule at the reservoir boundary @xcite . for a collision with a reservoir boundary the tangential @xmath0-component of momentum is unchanged but the normal @xmath1-component after collision becomes @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a reservoir momentum related to the reservoir temperature by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a reservoir coupling parameter . as @xmath6 the system decouples from the reservoir and the boundary becomes a hard wall , and as @xmath7 the incoming momentum is replaced by the reservoir momentum .",
    "a recent study of this system in contact with two reservoirs of the same temperature @xcite has shown that the active mechanical coupling leads to entropy production near each reservoir which then flows into the reservoir .",
    "these effects are local and involve a limited number of boundary layer particles regardless of the system size .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have proved a very effective means of testing theoretical approaches to the study of fluids both in equilibrium , and nonequilibrium steady states @xcite . given a particular atomic pair interaction ,",
    "the results are free of approximations , with an accuracy limited only by statistical considerations .",
    "it is usual to use the equipartition theorem to define the _ kinetic temperature _ , so in a system of @xmath8 particles in @xmath9 spatial dimensions the translational kinetic energy is @xmath10 per degree of freedom .",
    "we define instantaneous local temperatures for each particle so that in two spatial dimensions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and then the instantaneous system temperature is @xmath13 in the absence of a temperature gradient the average @xmath14 gives the system temperature , but when there is a temperature gradient the local time averages @xmath15 and @xmath16 give the local temperatures which will be used to determine the temperature profile inside the system .",
    "the difference between the local components of the local temperature can be used to give a measure of the deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we use @xmath17 and @xmath18 to define a local _ operational _ temperature for a nonequilibrium system , but it is more usual to attempt to connect the average _ local _ kinetic temperature and the _ local _ thermodynamic temperature . the relationship between this _ kinetic _ and _ thermodynamic _ temperature is only beginning to be explored @xcite .    for a qod system",
    "we can extended the idea of a kinetic temperature for a single atom to define the _ local kinetic temperature _ in the average volume element occupied by the particle , as the order of the particles is fixed .",
    "then we extend this idea to define other local thermodynamic properties using the properties of the particle that occupies the volume element .",
    "in particular the velocity distribution of the particle can be used to define the velocity distribution of the volume element and then the thermodynamic properties that are derived from it .    for equilibrium systems we expect a well - defined thermodynamic limit so that average properties converge with the inverse of the system size .",
    "however , for nonequilibrium systems a thermodynamic limit is not useful .",
    "if the temperature of the two reservoirs are fixed and the system size increased then the temperature gradient goes to zero .",
    "if the gradient is fixed then it is usual to observe a hydrodynamic instability at some threshold system size where the system behaviour abruptly changes . given this difficultly we consider sequences of _ equivalent _ nonequilibrium systems of different sizes or different gradients to obtain scaling relations which remain correct in the regime before the onset of hydrodynamic instability .",
    "in this section we introduce the simple deterministic microscopic model for thermal coupling of a system of hard disks to a reservoir which can be used with either , an equilibrium system or nonequilibrium steady state , to supply or remove heat . as this microscopic model couples mechanically and deterministically to the system",
    "it may be probed as would a standard dynamical system and energy and kinetic entropy flows calculated numerically without approximations .",
    "the mechanism has been introduced previously @xcite , and studied by computer simulation and kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional ( qod ) system introduced by @xcite can be modified to interact with an idealized _ heat reservoir _ in a deterministic and reversible way , to study both heat conduction in low dimensional systems @xcite , and the lyapunov spectra and mode structure .",
    "the deterministic reservoir allows the calculation of the usual dynamical systems properties as well the thermodynamic properties .",
    "this system contains hard disks of diameter @xmath19 ( which we set equal to 1 ) in a narrow channel that does not allow the disks to change their positional order , see figure ( [ fig : qds ] ) .",
    "therefore any property of particle @xmath20 can be associated with the same _ local _ property in the volume element @xmath21 , centred at the average position of particle @xmath20 , @xmath22 , thus for example , the local density is the inverse of the average volume occupied by the particle @xmath23 .",
    "hard - disk quasi - one - dimensional ( qod ) system .",
    "the height @xmath24 is sufficiently small that the disks can not pass one another .",
    "we choose the coordinate origin to be located at the bottom left corner of the system , and the periodic upper and lower system boundaries at @xmath25 are denoted by dashed lines .",
    "the boundaries at @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the hard walls of the reservoirs so this is a ( h , p ) qod system . ]",
    "the equations of motion connecting the qod system to the two reservoirs , one on the left - hand ( lh ) side at @xmath26 and the other on the right - hand ( rh ) side at @xmath28 define the _ thermal contact _",
    "so when a particle collides with a reservoir wall the normal component of the momentum of the particle @xmath29 is changed as given in eq .",
    "( [ wallcoll ] ) . for the lh reservoir @xmath30",
    "is the fixed value of the reservoir momentum and for the rh reservoir @xmath31 ( note that the reservoir momentum is always directed into the system ) .",
    "the reservoir coupling parameter @xmath5 represents the strength of the coupling of the reservoir to the system . if @xmath32 there is no interaction with the reservoir , and if @xmath33 the incoming momentum is completely replaced by the reservoir momentum .",
    "here we use an intermediate value of @xmath34 which provides an effective mix of the incoming momentum with the reservoir momentum .",
    "the system has a volume @xmath35 with a fixed width of @xmath36 , and then @xmath37 varies with the number of particles @xmath8 to give the desired density @xmath38 . as the qod system is narrow enough to prevent particles interchanging their positions",
    "@xmath39 , the order of the particles remains fixed ( both @xmath19 and the mass @xmath40 are set to one ) .",
    "the temperature profile is determined from the average components of the kinetic temperature of each particle ( the average of eq .",
    "[ kintemp ] ) .    to produce a nonequilibrium steady state it is sufficient to have reservoirs of different temperature on each side of the qod system .",
    "the energy entering the system from a boundary with reservoir momentum @xmath3 during a collision with a particle of incoming momentum @xmath29 is given by @xmath41.\\ ] ] the time average of this quantity gives the flux of energy _ into _ the system so for a total system energy balance @xmath42 must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to @xmath43 .",
    "the energy flux is controlled by both @xmath3 and the value of @xmath5 , going to zero as @xmath6 and the reservoirs become disconnected from the system .",
    "we choose the temperatures of the two reservoirs independently , so the temperature of the left - hand side reservoir is @xmath44 and varies , and the temperature of the right - hand side reservoir is kept constant at @xmath45 .",
    "this produces a temperature gradient of @xmath46 so heat will flow from the left - hand reservoir to the right - hand reservoir .",
    "an overview of simulation state points is given in table .",
    "( [ statepoints ] ) .",
    ".the simulation state points . for each density",
    "@xmath47 there is a small and large temperature gradient considered .",
    "generally , @xmath45 and groups of simulations are carried out with either @xmath48 fixed varying @xmath8 ( or equivalently @xmath47 ) or @xmath8 fixed varying @xmath48 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ slopes ]    the graphs of the entropy production @xmath19 as functions of @xmath8 and @xmath49 are also very similar but as they are not linear we can not repeat the analysis above . however , we can deduce from table ( [ slopes ] ) that at @xmath50 the functional form of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath49 can be obtained from the functional form as a function of @xmath8 by replacing @xmath8 by @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , the functional form of @xmath53 gives the functional form as a function of @xmath49 by replacing @xmath8 by @xmath54 .",
    "these results are qualitatively the same for the low density @xmath55 with only small changes in numerical factors .       for qod systems at a density of @xmath50 and temperature gradient of @xmath56 for a large range of system sizes .",
    "the right - hand reservoir temperature is fixed at @xmath45 and @xmath57 varies such that @xmath48 remains fixed .",
    "the filled red circles are values of the heat flux into the system through the left - hand boundary @xmath58 , the filled blue circles are the values of the heat flux out of the system through the right - hand boundary @xmath59 , and the filled green circles are the values calculated from the heat flux vector @xmath60 ( [ jql ] ) .",
    "the line corresponds to @xmath61 . ]",
    "lower dimensional systems have long been shown to exhibit anomalous thermal conductivity with typically a power law divergence of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the qod system is a restricted two - dimensional system where the average momentum is equal to zero , so we might expect two - dimensional behavior or perhaps marginally below two - dimensional . in fig .",
    "( [ cond ] ) we have a result that suggests that @xmath64 although extrapolation to large @xmath8 is always problematic .",
    "the numerical convergence of this system at fixed @xmath8 suggests that the initial value of the heat flux is high and then this converges slowly to a smaller value .",
    "ideally , we may try to have the number of collisions per particle fixed for each system size but this is difficult for larger systems as the total run time increases at least as fast as @xmath65 .",
    "therefore the accuracy of the results decreases quickly for large system sizes .",
    "the consistency of the different routes to the heat flux gives a good indication of the convergence of the result , so the result for @xmath66 is the least reliable of those reported in fig .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the consequences of a particular model microscopic coupling of a system to a reservoir .",
    "the advantages of the model include its relative simplicity and the fact that it is deterministic which allows straightforward application of dynamical systems techniques .",
    "clearly the fact that the particles remain ordered from left to right , and this allows us to connect the properties of a volume element with the properties of a single particle , is a virtue of the quasi - one - dimensional system . in more realistic systems this is not possible as particles enter and leave eulerian volume elements , but the generalisation is a technical rather than conceptual difficulty .",
    "the microscopic expression for the local heat flux vector derived here has been shown to satisfy the expected continuity equation for heat flow at both low density , where kinetic contributions dominate , and at high density where potential contributions dominate .",
    "the heat flux vector also agrees very well with the amount of energy entering the system from the left - hand reservoir and the amount of energy leaving via the right - hand reservoir .",
    "strong scaling relations were obtained for the temperature profile as a function of particle number and for local temperature differences .",
    "these results suggest that the system behaves more simply than expected with regard to changes in density and temperature gradient .",
    "the entropy terms calculated here are all kinetic contributions and would not be expected to match at high densities although the kinetic contributions to the heat flux vector match the temperature times the kinetic contribution to the entropy flux . as potential contributions to the heat flux vector are large at high densities we would expect large potential contributions to the various entropy terms , including its production and flux , to be present .",
