    "the reaction mechanism leading to the knockout of a single proton by a real photon has been the subject of some debate recently .",
    "some nonrelativistic analyses @xcite suggest that the direct knockout ( dko ) contribution may be very small compared to the data .",

    "the above statements illustrate the existing difficulty of arriving at a consensus within the nonrelativistic framework as to the extent of contributions from processes beyond simple direct knockout to ground state transitions in @xmath7 reactions .",
    "although the differing views stated above appear to be somewhat dependent on the nuclear models used in the nonrelativistic calculations , they are , however , symptomatic of our incomplete understanding of the nature of the reaction mechanism for photonuclear reactions .",

    "the @xmath29pb data are not suitable for analysis using this model because of the lack of coulomb distortions for the incident and final electrons .",

    "the data at @xmath6 = 73.5 mev from rauf @xcite were also obtained at the max - lab .",
    "these data were normalized to previous measurements including those of mathews",
    "_ @xcite .    the most obvious feature apparent in fig .",
    "1 is that the calculations tend to form a narrow band lying above the data .",
    "note that there is not much sensitivity to reasonable variation of the ingredients of the model .",
    "the light dot - dashed curve in all the figures shows the solid curve divided by a factor of 2 , and this brings the curve close to the data in all cases .",
    "the calculated curves have the correct shapes and the variation of magnitude with incident photon energy also seems to be correct , but the curves lie consistently above the data by a factor of 2 .",

    "again the calculated curves lie above the data by close to a factor of 2 .",
    "we see that for photon energies above 40 mev the energy and angular dependence are quite well reproduced by our model , but results lie above the data by a factor of 2 .    in an attempt to compare to other data as well",
    ", we consider two experiments in which the first excited state of @xmath31b at 2.12 mev ( 1/2@xmath32 ) could not be resolved from the ground state .",
    "the experiment of mori _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was performed at the laboratory of nuclear science at tohoku university .",
    "the experiment of harty _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was performed at mainz .",
    "the differential cross sections of both experiments were normalized without reference to any other experimental results and found to be consistent with other data . in order to compare to some data which do not contain the first excited state , ground state data from other sources",
    "were multiplied by a factor of 1.27 by both groups .",
    "this factor is assumed to account for population of the first excited state in @xmath31b being @xmath3327% as probable as population of the ground state over the range of energies considered in both experiments .",
    "we adopt this factor in what follows .    in the left - hand column of fig .",
    "3 we show the measured energy distributions of mori _ et al . _ @xcite as the circular data points .",
    "the triangular points are taken from the data of harty _ et al .",
    "the angles at which these data were taken do not coincide with the angles of the experiment by mori _",
    "et al._. for this reason the triangles shown at 66.0@xmath34 represent cross sections which have been averaged for proton angles of 63.3@xmath34 and 68.4@xmath34 , while on the graph labeled 91.1@xmath34 we show data averaged for 88.5@xmath34 and 93.5@xmath34 . note",
    "that the 88 mev data point of harty _ et al .",
    "_ lies almost on top of the 87.8 mev data point of mori _ et al . _",
    "showing the consistency between the two data sets .",
    "the curves are calculated assuming that the recoil nucleus is left in its ground state , and then multiplied by 1.27 .",
    "the curves again lie above the data by a factor of 2 at low photon energies , but at the higher energies of the mainz experiment the calculations seem to move closer to the data .    the right - hand column of fig .",
    "3 shows the angular distributions obtained by harty",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite compared to calculations as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "as the energy of the incident photons increases , the calculations seem to move from lying above the data by about a factor of 2 , to falling within the error bars for the data at the highest energy .",
    "of course , because of the large error bars at larger proton angles the trend is not definitive , but it is suggestive .",
    "the picture that is emerging for the status of the comparisons for the @xmath3c case can be further clarified by looking at the data available for @xmath35 reactions on this nucleus as well as those leading to its formation as a residual nucleus .",
    "the data are those obtained recently by bright _",
    "@xcite at uppsala .",
    "figure 4 shows comparisons to the data at proton energies of 98 and 176 mev for ground state transitions to @xmath3c and @xmath36n residual nuclei .",
    "the former reaction is the inverse of the @xmath5 reactions discussed above .",
    "the comparisons for the @xmath3c residual nucleus are shown on the right hand side of the figure . using the same wave functions and spectroscopic factors as in fig . 1",
    ", we find that the calculations for @xmath37 = 98 mev lie slightly above the data at all angles except for the last point at @xmath38140@xmath34 . at 176 mev",
    "the calculations are closer to the data except for the large angles .",
    "thus the data for the inverse reaction confirm the behavior alluded to above ; at lower energies the calculations seem to overestimate the cross sections .    the comparisons on the left - hand side of fig . 4 present a somewhat different picture .",
    "using the maximum value for the spectroscopic factor , the relativistic calculations for radiative capture on @xmath3c are close to or below the data . with a more realistic value of the spectroscopic factor",
    "the calculations will be further reduced in magnitude .",
    "this situation is in clear contrast to the cases discussed above .",
    "it should be noted , however , that with a spectroscopic factor in the range 0.51.0 ( the maximum possible value is 1.0 in this case ) , the contributions of the knockout mechanism to the reaction are substantial in the region of lower missing momenta .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out here that there are also unresolved difficulties for the @xmath3c target in the @xmath0 reaction , in addition to the difficulties discussed in the current work .",
    "the data from nikhef @xcite are for kinematics with a fixed final proton kinetic energy of @xmath37 = 70 mev and nonrelativistic calculations shown in that paper can not reproduce the shape of the distribution in missing momentum . in particular",
    "when the calculations are scaled to fit the peak for positive missing momenta , the calculations fall below the data for negative missing momenta .",
    "our relativistic calculations show exactly this behaviour and the spectroscopic factor that we have used in this work is obtained by matching to the positive missing momentum peak .",
    "a proposed solution to this problem was to adjust the ratio of transverse to longitudinal response functions , and when this ratio was adjusted to @xmath11.3 @xcite the shape of the missing momentum distribution was reproduced .",
    "this problem was considered further by van der steenhoven @xcite who found no justification for this enhancement factor .",
    "the newer data from mainz on this nucleus , reported by blomqvist _",
    "_ @xcite have a higher final proton kinetic energy of @xmath39 90 mev . in this case , with the increase in normalization of the data by a factor of 1.19 @xcite , both nonrelativistic and our relativistic calculations can describe the shape of the measured missing momentum distribution using the spectroscopic factor as obtained from matching to the positive missing momentum peak of the nikhef data .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the current results for the @xmath5 reaction on this nucleus : at low final proton energies model calculations differ from the data and as the final proton energy increases the calculations move closer to experimental results .",
    "the data for proton knockout from the @xmath40 orbital in @xmath3c seem to indicate that at low energies a simple shell model description is not adequate to explain the data .",
    "a more complete description might possibly involve inclusion of the deformed nature of the ground state wave function through a configuration mixing picture .",
    "data for both the @xmath41 and @xmath5 reactions has been obtained for a @xmath27b target by de bever @xcite at two different energies .",
    "the data for knockout of a @xmath40 proton leading to the ground state of @xmath42be are shown in fig .",
    "spectroscopic factors were obtained by scaling the model calculations to the @xmath41 momentum distribution ( or reduced cross section ) data for the @xmath37 = 70 mev case .",
    "the other @xmath41 and @xmath5 curves were then calculated without any adjustment of the parameters .",
    "it should be noted that the optical potentials used here are parameterized using proton elastic scattering data on targets from @xmath3c to @xmath29pb . as a result of a lack of proton elastic scattering data on @xmath27b",
    ", we simply extrapolate the ( e+a)-dependent potentials for use with a target lighter than @xmath3c .",
    "the @xmath5 calculations for this nucleus are quite sensitive to changes in the potentials used to generate the nuclear wave functions . in spite of this , and the fact that @xmath27b is not a closed shell nucleus , the dko clearly produces results in the neighbourhood of the data .      figure 6 shows the differential cross section as a function of proton angle for knockout of a valence proton from an @xmath28o target , leading to the ground state of @xmath43n .",
    "the photon energy range is the largest available , with eight energies in the range 60 mev @xmath44 361 mev .",
    "the data come from three sources : miller _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite provide data points at energies of 60 an 72 mev , while data shown at 60 , 80 and 100 mev are from findlay and owens @xcite .",
    "the high energy data for photons in the range 196 mev @xmath44 361 mev are from adams _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . at low energies",
    "the calculated curves are generally close to the data , reproducing the magnitude and shapes quite well . for the higher energy data of adams",
    "_ et al . _",
    "the calculations tend to be close to the data points at small angles while falling below the data as the proton angle increases .",
    "this is the behavior one expects if meson exchange processes are going to become important as the missing momentum increases .    in order to remove some of the kinematic dependence from these curves",
    "we have calculated a _ reduced cross section _ by dividing the differential cross section of eq .",
    "( [ gp_cross ] ) by a kinematic factor @xcite : @xmath45    .",
    "\\label{reduce}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    figure 7 shows the reduced cross section as a function of missing momentum for all the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "6 , as well as additional data provided by leitch _",
    "the curves are generated using the same ingredients as the solid curves of fig .",
    "6 but restricted to the kinematic range covered by the data .",
    "an interesting observation here is that the model results are close to the data for missing momentum less than about 500 mev/@xmath2 .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the momentum of a free proton with kinetic energy equal to the charged pion mass .",
    "the calculations start to fall below the data in this kinematic region , which seems to be a good indication that we are seeing the need for inclusion of pion exchange diagrams to the reaction mechanism , and provides some idea of where these diagrams become important .",
    "figure 8 shows results for proton removal from @xmath29pb , leading to two doublets and one resolved state in @xmath46tl , for two relatively low photon energies : 45 mev and 54 mev .",
    "the data are from bobeldijk _ et al .",
    "these authors performed a nonrelativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) analysis of the data and found that the dko contribution tends to lie up to a factor of 10 below the data .",
    "revised recent analyses @xcite indicate that this factor may have been unrealistic .",
    "our present analysis , on the other hand , shows that the relativistic calculations do come close to predicting the correct magnitudes of the observed cross sections . within the parameter uncertainties ,",
    "it is evident that the dko mechanism is the leading contributor to the reaction at these energies .",
    "in this paper we have presented relativistic calculations for the @xmath5 reaction and its inverse for a number of target nuclei .",
    "the results for the light targets cover a wide energy range , while the results for the lead target are at low energy but for a variety of final nuclear states .",
    "the analysis was done in a consistent manner with no free parameters . in all cases but one , @xmath3c@xmath35",
    ", the spectroscopic factor is obtained from a parallel analysis of the corresponding @xmath47 data .    in cases of transitions with simple nuclear structure ,",
    "relativistic calculations indicate that the dko mechanism is the main contributor to the cross section for lower missing momenta . for larger",
    "missing momenta one finds clear deviations indicating an increased role for higher order processes such as meson exchange and @xmath9isobar contributions .",
    "nonrelativistic analyses often indicate that the contributions from the dko mechanism are small and that meson exchange effects are sometimes dominant even at lower energies .",
    "in contrast , the present relativistic analysis suggests substantial contributions from the dko mechanism to the cross sections over a wide range of energies .",
    "the analysis also points out that meson exchange effects are required at higher missing momenta .",
    "in the course of this analysis we have found that in the case of the @xmath3c target for photon energies below 80 mev , the relativistic calculations appear to overestimate the cross section data by close to a factor of 2 .",
    "this situation is puzzling and may indicate either some complications due to the structure of the @xmath3c nucleus itself or to some subtleties in the combined analysis of @xmath47 and @xmath5 for this target .",
    "it must also be noted that these difficulties do not occur for the spherical nuclei @xmath28o or @xmath29pb , which are also considered in the present work .",
    "it is our feeling that the differences between theory and experiment at the lower proton energies for the @xmath3c target reflect the need for a proper description of the structure of this nucleus to include the intrinsic ground state deformation .",
    "the consistent approach based on a combined analysis of these two reactions @xcite leads , in our view , to the conclusion that the @xmath3c ground state can not be adequately described by simple single particle configurations .    in the case of transitions with simple structure ( mainly single particle ) our calculations indicate that meson exchange effects will not be important until one reaches missing momentum near 500 mev/@xmath2 . with the effort to push @xmath47 reactions towards this region of missing momentum",
    "it would be interesting to see how important mec effects will turn out to be in the relativistic model .",
    "van der sluys _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have considered this question in a nonrelativistic random phase approximation ( rpa ) framework and found large contributions from mec s for larger missing momenta .",
    "one point of interest is that the reactions discussed , @xmath41 and @xmath5 , show different sensitivities to the description of the bound state .",
    "this is probably due to the different range of missing momenta sampled by the two reactions .",
    "the @xmath41 reaction has been primarily concerned with low missing momenta where the bound wave function is constrained by properties such as binding energy and rms radius .",
    "the bound state wave functions that we use show little difference in momentum space for small momenta , and so it is not surprising that the @xmath41 results are very similar in this region .",
    "differences between the bound state wave functions do arise , however , for larger missing momenta in @xmath41 and for the inherently large missing momentum reaction @xmath5 .",
    "this is not a surprise because this is where the nuclear wave function is poorly constrained and the region where we see differences between these bound state wave functions in momentum space .",
    "a common criticism of the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) approach , both relativistic and nonrelativistic , is the lack of orthogonality of the bound and continuum wave functions .",
    "it is argued that this lack of orthogonality could invoke spurious contributions to the cross sections .",
    "the distorted continuum wave function is an approximation to the many - body wave function of the nuclear system with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this approximation derives its support from the fact that the wave function is constrained by proton - nucleus elastic scattering data .",
    "nonrelativistic rpa calculations do not suffer from this lack of orthogonality , but the wave functions are not able to account for the elastic scattering data . a simple method for restoring orthogonality",
    "has been suggested by boffi _",
    "_ @xcite and ciofi degli atti _",
    "these authors find the orthogonality effects to be relevant mainly at large angles .",
    "it is likely that this feature will carry over into the relativistic calculations and hence would not substantially change the main characteristics of the present calculations .",
    "the present results pose certain challenges for the relativistic approach .",
    "if the dko contributions are large then the data would suggest that the mec effects are suppressed in the relativistic models , at least at the lower energies .",
    "relativistic models must explain this suppression and in the meantime face the challenge of accounting for the observed relatively large photoneutron cross sections .",
    "spin - dependent observables are likely to play an important role in clarifying the reaction mechanisms . it should be noted here that the cross section angular distributions for @xmath5 reactions do not have much structure in most cases .",
    "the differences between competing models are then mainly differences in magnitudes , and hence may be related to normalization uncertainties in the models .",
    "when we discuss spin - dependent observables these normalization uncertainties cancel out and hence a better test of the model is likely to result .",

    "<S> results of relativistic calculations of the direct knockout ( dko ) mechanism for the photon induced removal of a proton from a target nucleus over a wide range of energies and nuclei are presented . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic factors used in the calculations are fixed from consistent analyses of the quasifree electron scattering process @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that within the uncertainties of the model , the knockout contributions are generally close to the experimental data for missing momenta below @xmath1 500 mev/@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in disagreement with nonrelativistic analyses which often find that the direct knockout contribution can be quite small compared to the data and that meson exchange corrections can be important . </S>",
    "<S> the present study suggests that meson exchange current contributions may not be as large when treated in a relativistic framework . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out some difficulties we encountered in analyzing the data for a @xmath3c target at photon energies below 80 mev . </S>"
