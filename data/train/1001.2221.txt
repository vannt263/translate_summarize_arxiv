    "typically in quintessence theories with an asymptotically vanishing effective cosmological constant , the energy contrast in dark energy @xmath3 rises from near zero for redshifts @xmath4 to near one for @xmath5 , mimicking a true cosmological constant . at late times",
    "the quintessence field may begin to oscillate about its minimum , behaving like nonrelativistic matter , or the quintessence field may evolve toward infinity  in both cases with vanishing vacuum energy . in such theories , there is a period between roughly 3.5 gyr and 20 gyr after the big bang when @xmath0 .",
    "however if the universe continues to expand forever , or even if positive curvature begins to dominate at late times ( after the quintessence field has evolved to its minimum ) and the universe enters a contracting stage , this period when the energy densities of dark energy and matter are comparable is a small or vanishing fraction of the total lifetime of the universe .",
    "this is called the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "however in axion quintessence ( as in other unstable de sitter quintessence models ) , the cosmological era with @xmath6 may represent a significant fraction of the universe s lifetime if the minimum of the axion potential is negative ( unstable [ de sitter ] axion quintessence ) , thus resolving  @xcite the cosmic coincidence problem .",

    "vilenkin  @xcite summarizes the currently predominant view that the dark energy is a cosmological constant , and points out the major weaknesses of most quintessence models : ( i ) most quintessence models assume that @xmath9 as the quintessence field @xmath10 evolves toward its minimum ( which may be at @xmath11 ) , conflicting with the expectation that @xmath8 ought to evolve to a nonzero vacuum energy density ; ( ii ) most quintessence models do not solve the coincidence problem that @xmath12 ( the subscript `` 0 '' will denote present values ) ; and ( iii ) since the present dark energy average equation of state parameter @xmath13 , perhaps @xmath14 and quintessence models are irrelevant .    the unstable axion quintessence potential @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and the planck mass @xmath17 gev , addresses all of these issues , since the facts that the minimum of the potential is at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 but @xmath21 are interrelated aspects of the model , and occur for an appreciable range of initial values for @xmath10 .",

    "the basic cosmological equations are presented for the evolution of the scalar field , the scale factor , and the hubble parameter , and cast in the form of a scaled , dimensionless system of first - order equations in the conformal time , appropriate for a contracting ( or expanding ) universe .",

    "the quintessence axion is an ultra - light scalar field with @xmath137 , so @xmath10 `` sits and waits '' during the early evolution of the universe , and only starts to move when @xmath138 ( figs .",

    ", @xmath10 has yet to reach the minimum of the potential energy ( see fig .",

    "[ fig - ah ] , [ fig - phi ] , and  [ fig - psi ] indicate that @xmath75 , @xmath10 , and @xmath147 are approaching a singularity near @xmath131 . in fact , in an era of kination during contraction during which @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , while @xmath151 ( see fig .",

    "( the monotonically increasing field @xmath10 in a periodic potential can be interpreted as an oscillating field . ) at the very least , there should be gravitational production of particles by @xmath10 during contraction .",
    "figures  [ fig - w ] and  [ fig - w - o ] follow the contracting stage further , illustrating that although @xmath153 twice just after @xmath101 , the universe ultimately enters a stage of kination in which @xmath146 near @xmath131 .",
    "note that @xmath154 until well after @xmath130 .",
    "after matter - quintessence equality at @xmath155 , the scalar field energy density always dominates over the matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "there is a period from @xmath156 until @xmath157 when the scalar field potential energy is comparable to its kinetic energy , and then the kinetic energy ( which scales as @xmath158 ) predominates during the rapid contraction to a big crunch ( see fig .  [ fig - ke - v ] ) .",
    "as the universe contracts , density inhomogeneities are amplified and presumably black holes are formed , similarly to the contracting stage of the ekpyrotic universe  @xcite with @xmath159 . depending on the strength of the coupling ( which we have neglected here ) between the quintessence axion and other particles , @xmath10 may decay and produce radiation and matter .",
    "there should at least be gravitational production of particles by @xmath10 during contraction . as the universe reheats during contraction , broken symmetries are restored .",
    "it is possible that inflating patches may be generated , spawning new universes from the old .",
    "these issues are currently under investigation .    in summary",
    ", the unstable axion quintessence potential resolves the issues concerning quintessence raised by vilenkin : the minimum of the potential is not at zero , but at a negative value @xmath160 , @xmath19 with only a single fine tuning ( in the anthropic range ) , and @xmath132 naturally satisfies @xmath161 , for an appreciable 23% range of possible initial values for the quintessence field . and for a universe like ours , the coincidence time when the energy densities of dark energy and matter are comparable varies ( as long as @xmath162 is not too small  say , @xmath163 0.05 ) from 25%50% of the lifetime of the universe .",
