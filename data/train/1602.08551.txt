    "it is widely believed that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the predominant source of galactic cosmic - rays ( crs ) with energies up to @xmath03pev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "rcw86 , probably the remnant of sn185 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is thought to be an efficient cr accelerator , based on the detection of nonthermal x - rays @xcite and @xmath5-rays @xcite .",
    "the large amount ( @xmath01@xmath6 ) of fe ejecta in a low ionization state @xcite and balmer - dominated shocks @xcite observed in rcw86 suggest a type ia supernova origin .",
    "the remnant is likely to have evolved in a wind - blown cavity formed by the progenitor binary system @xcite , maintaining a high enough shock velocity to accelerate cr particles over the entire lifetime of the remnant .",
    "in particular , its northeast ( ne ) rim is still expanding within the low - density cavity or has encountered the cavity wall very recently , so its current shock speed is the highest within the entire remnant @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the ne rim of rcw86 has been frequently studied to understand the details of the cr acceleration mechanism .    a velocity of the snr shock wave in combination with the physical condition of the postshock plasma offers a key for constraining the cr acceleration efficiency .",
    "the most direct way to determine the shock velocity is to measure the proper motion of the shock front . using two _ chandra _ observations of the rcw86 ne",
    "rim taken in 2004 and 2007 , @xcite ( hereafter h09 ) obtained the proper motion of the nonthermal x - ray filaments over a three - year baseline to be @xmath7 .",
    "this proper motion corresponds to a shock velocity of @xmath8kms@xmath1 at the well - agreed distance of 2.5kpc @xcite .",
    "h09 also analyzed an h@xmath3  spectrum from the same region and derived a postshock proton temperature of @xmath9kev based on the width of the emission lines .",
    "this was unexpected because the theoretical relationship between the postshock temperature and shock velocity , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean particle mass and the proton mass ) , predicts a much higher postshock temperature ( @xmath13 = 4270kev depending on the degree of thermal equilibration ) for @xmath14 = 6000kms@xmath1 .",
    "h09 attributed this discrepancy to the efficiency of the cr acceleration : a substantial fraction of the kinetic energy is being transferred into nonthermal energy .",
    "they concluded that @xmath1550% of the postshock pressure is produced by the cr protons .    in their follow - up h@xmath3  observation , however , the mean proper motion of the forward shock filaments was inferred to be @xmath16yr@xmath1 , corresponding to a velocity of only @xmath17kms@xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h13 ) .",
    "this velocity is far lower than their previous x - ray measurement , and consistent with the measured proton temperature ( @xmath02kev ) with no energy injection to cr acceleration .",
    "h13 suggested that the h@xmath3-bright filaments are biased toward denser regions with decelerated shock velocities , while the x - ray - emitting filaments represent the relatively undecelerated regions of the shock .",
    "this scenario seems reasonable , given the fact that the forward shock of the snr is interacting with an inhomogeneous medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , h13 found substantial variation in the velocity of the h@xmath3  filaments ( ranging from 300 to 3000kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "we note , however , that there is also a substantial uncertainty in the x - ray velocity measurement of h09 , due to the small separation in time ( only 3yrs ) between the two _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the positional shift they obtained ( @xmath7 ) corresponds to only 3 @xmath18 1  pixels of the _ chandra_/acis detector .",
    "an additional x - ray observation using a much longer baseline is therefore crucial for determining the precise shock velocity .    here",
    "we present the latest _",
    "observation of the rcw86 ne rim obtained in 2015 , which is 11 years after the first observation .",
    "it reveals a much slower velocity of the nonthermal x - ray filaments than measured by h09 . in  2 , we describe the observations and data analysis .",
    "we discuss the results in  3 , and present our conclusions in  4 . since the aim of the present work is to report the accurate velocity of the forward shock , we focus exclusively on the imaging analysis in this _",
    "letter_. detailed spectroscopy and further studies will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in the text and the error bars in the figures represent the 1@xmath19 confidence level , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we observed the ne rim of rcw86 on 2015 june 26 using the _ chandra_/acis - s chips .",
    "as summarized in table[table ] , the aim point and roll angle were set almost identical to those in the first observation of this region in 2004 @xcite , so that we can measure the proper motion as accurately as possible .",
    "we used ciao version 4.8 and the latest calibration database ( caldb ) for the data analysis .",
    "examination of the light curves revealed no significant background flares .",
    "the net exposure we obtained was 67ks .",
    ".summary of the observations .",
    "[ table ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     , width=309 ]        figure[image ] shows the exposure - corrected acis image of the 0.51.0kev ( red ) , 1.02.0kev ( green ) , and 2.05.0kev ( blue ) bands , indicating that the dominant x - ray emission component changes from thermal ( red ) to nonthermal ( blue ) along the filaments from the south to the north .",
    "the previous work has suggested that the southern part has already encountered the dense wall of the wind - blown cavity , whereas the northern part is still in the low - density cavity and thus maintains a high cr acceleration efficiency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we confirm below . for accurate determination of the x - ray proper motion , we compared the images from the 2004 and 2015 observations , and aligned the coordinates using the relative positions of the four background point sources indicated in figure[image ] .",
    "the details of the alignment procedure are described in @xcite .",
    "the rms of the residuals for the source positions between the two epochs is only @xmath20 , which we take as a systematic uncertainty in our proper motions measurements described below .",
    "we extract projection profiles of the nonthermal filaments from the yellow and magenta rectangles in figure[image ] ( hereafter `` ne@xmath21 '' and `` ne@xmath22 '' , respectively ) .",
    "the latter ( fainter filament ) is exactly where h09 measured the shock velocity .",
    "figure[profile ] ( _ left _ and _ middle _ ) shows the profiles from both the 2004 ( black ) and 2015 ( red ) observations , using data in the 0.55.0kev band .",
    "the shock front has clearly shifted over the 11 years in both filaments . using the method established by @xcite , we determine the proper motions of the ne@xmath21 and ne@xmath22 filaments to be @xmath23yr@xmath1 and @xmath24yr@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding velocity is @xmath25kms@xmath1 for the ne@xmath21 and @xmath2kms@xmath1 for the ne@xmath22 ( at the distance of 2.5kpc ) , significantly less than the measurement by h09 . for comparison , figure[profile ] ( _ left _ and _ middle _ ) also shows the `` expected '' profiles ( blue solid lines ) for the case of @xmath14 = 6000kms@xmath1 ( h09 ) .",
    "an uncertainty in the distance to the snr , @xmath26kpc @xcite , corresponds to that in the shock velocity of @xmath27kms@xmath1 for the ne@xmath22 filament ( @xmath28% of the mean value ) .",
    "in addition , there is a systematic uncertainty of @xmath0260kms@xmath1 inferred from the astrometric accuracy ( @xmath20 between the two epoch ) .",
    "we also estimate another systematic uncertainty in our measurements by slightly changing the angle of the profile extraction regions , and obtain differences only within @xmath29yr@xmath1 or @xmath30kms@xmath1 .",
    "to summarize , the velocity of the ne@xmath22 filament never exceeds 4500kms@xmath1 even with the multiple uncertainty components , and that of the ne@xmath21 filament must be even lower .",
    "the large time separation between the two observations also allows us to examine if the thermal - dominated filaments have indeed decelerated due to the collision with the dense material .",
    "the right panels of figure[profile ] show the profiles extracted from the white rectangle in figure[image ] ( hereafter `` east '' ) . unlike the ne filaments , we see only a little shift of the shock front . the proper motion of this region is measured to be @xmath31yr@xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath4kms@xmath1 .",
    "we establish that the east rim has a lower velocity .",
    "the value is comparable to the h@xmath3-measured forward shock velocity at the southwest rim of this snr where the shock front is also interacting with dense material ( @xmath0800kms@xmath1 : * ? ? ?",
    "our new observation of rcw86 has revealed that the actual proper motions of the nonthermal filaments ( ne@xmath21 and ne@xmath22 ) are significantly slower than previously measured by h09 .",
    "however , the updated shock velocities are still inconsistent with the mean velocity derived from the h@xmath3  proper motion in this region ( @xmath01200kms@xmath1 : h13 ) .",
    "this implies that the ne rim of rcw86 has a range of shock velocities due to a small - scale density inhomogeneity , and the h@xmath3-bright filaments are indeed biased toward the denser regions as suggested by h13 .",
    "in fact , we have revealed the significant difference between the velocities of the ne@xmath21 and ne@xmath22 filaments in our analysis . in the thermal - dominated ( east ) region , on the other hand , the x - ray and h@xmath3  velocities are consistent with each other , indicating the presence of dense material with a larger spatial scale , probably a wall formed by the progenitor wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , that had decelerated the overall shock propagation .",
    "assuming pressure equilibrium and thus constant @xmath32 along the shell ( where @xmath33 is an ambient density ) , we roughly estimate the density ratio between the east and ne@xmath22 regions to be @xmath34 .",
    "ours is not the first result casting doubt upon the extremely high velocity ( @xmath06000kms@xmath1 ) claimed by h09 .",
    "@xcite compared some observed characteristics of rcw86 with their hydrodynamical simulations of a type ia snr evolving in a wind - blown bubble .",
    "although most of the characteristics were successfully reproduced with reasonable initial conditions , only the high shock velocity at the ne rim required more complex conditions , i.e. , a significant offset between the explosion center and the snr geometrical center .",
    "recent _ fermi _ observations of rcw86 disfavor a hadronic origin for the @xmath5-ray emission , where the inferred cr pressure is much lower than the estimate by h09 @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies have likely been resolved by our result .",
    "notably , the refined velocity of the nonthermal x - ray filaments ( 18003000kms@xmath1 ) is consistent with an older estimate from the typical photon energy of the synchrotron x - rays , under the assumption that the acceleration and loss timescales for the relativistic electrons are the same @xcite ( see also @xcite for other regions of this snr ) .",
    "this implies that the electrons responsible for the observed synchrotron x - rays have achieved their maximum energy at the ne region of rcw86 .    from the relationship of @xmath10 , a postshock proton temperature at the ne@xmath22 region",
    "is derived to be @xmath011kev , assuming thermal equilibrium ( or higher if the equilibrium has not been achieved ) . despite the substantial drop from the h09 value ( i.e. , @xmath13 = 4270kev )",
    ", this temperature is still higher than that directly measured from the h@xmath3  spectrum ( @xmath02.3kev : h13 ) .",
    "one might , therefore , consider that a significant amount of the shock energy is injected into cr acceleration .",
    "however , since the h@xmath3  emission is likely to be enhanced at denser regions where the shock velocity is lower , it could be inappropriate to combine the h@xmath3  and _ nonthermal _ x - ray measurements for studies of shock waves interacting with highly inhomogeneous environment , like the ne rim of rcw86 .",
    "we should also note that a substantial fraction of the upstream kinetic energy can be transferred into downstream turbulence , and thus the cr pressure estimated by the postshock temperature could be overestimated when naively compared with the shock velocity @xcite .",
    "one open question is if _ thermal _ x - ray emission from the swept - up ambient medium coincides with the h@xmath3-bright filaments in terms of both kinematics and plasma properties .",
    "since h@xmath3  and thermal x - ray spectra constrain postshock proton and electron temperatures , respectively , they have often been combined to determine the efficiency of collisionless thermal equilibration between the protons and electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the proper motion measurements on the rcw86 east ( this work ) as well as the northwestern rim of sn1006 @xcite suggest a good coincidence between the thermal x - ray and h@xmath3  filaments , this should be verified with adiditional observations of h@xmath3-bright forward shocks in other snrs , like kepler s snr @xcite and the cygnus loop @xcite . future observations with _ hitomi ( astro - h ) _ will allow us to determine the ion temperature of the swept - up medium . comparison between it and the h@xmath3-measured proton temperature will also be useful for understanding the relationship between the thermal x - ray and h@xmath3  observables .",
    "we have presented new , improved measurements of the x - ray proper motion in the rcw86 northeastern rim using _",
    "chandra _ data taken in 2004 and 2015 ( with an 11-year separation ) .",
    "the velocity of the nonthermal filaments is derived to be 18003000kms@xmath1 ( at the distance of 2.5kpc ) , which is much lower than the previous measurement by h09 , but still significantly higher than the velocity inferred from the h@xmath3  proper motion ( h13 ) .",
    "this implies different origins of the filaments bright in nonthermal x - rays and h@xmath3  emission , with the former having a higher velocity .",
    "caution should be exercised before combining nonthermal x - ray kinematics and h@xmath3  spectroscopy to study shock physics , at least in a complex environment such as this .",
    "we have also shown that the thermal filament immediately to the south of the nonthermal filament has a velocity of @xmath4kms@xmath1 , significantly slower than the nonthermal filament .",
    "the consistency between the velocities measured with the thermal x - ray and h@xmath3  emission suggests a common origin , but this should be verified with more observational work ."
