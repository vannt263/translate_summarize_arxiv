    "according to their timing properties and shapes of x - ray color - color diagrams ( cds ) or hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ) , low mass neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) can be divided into two classes : z sources and atoll sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "six galactic nsxbs have been classified as z sources : sco  x-1 , gx  17 + 2 , gx  349 + 2 , gx  5@xmath11 , gx  340 + 0 , and cyg  x-2 . as shown in figure 1a of the paper of hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) , the tracks in the cds of cyg  x-2 ,",
    "gx  5@xmath11 , and gx  340 + 0 ( the so - called cyg - like z sources ) resemble the letter `` z '' .",
    "however , the tracks in the cds of sco  x-1 , gx  17 + 2 , and gx  349 + 2 ( the so - called sco - like z sources ) constitute a pattern looking like the greek letter `` @xmath0 '' . from top to bottom , the tracks in the cds of z sources are divided into three branches which are called horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) , and flaring branch ( fb ) .",
    "the cds of atoll sources are different from those of z sources . generally , a complete cd of an atoll source consists of three parts which are called island state ( is ) , lower banana ( lb ) , and upper banana ( ub ) , respectively",
    ". however , an additional part , i.e. , an extreme island state ( eis ) is present in some cases ( homan et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "in addition to the six z sources , other two nsxbs also show the characteristics of z sources in most cases .",
    "one is circinus  x-1 ( cir x-1 ) .",
    "shirey , bradt , & levine ( 1999 ) studied the timing and spectral behaviors of cir x-1 and considered this source as a z source .",
    "ding , qu , & li ( 2003 ) investigated the evolution of the hard x - ray spectra along the `` z '' track of cir  x-1 and found that the evolution behaviors are similar to those of other z sources .",
    "however , it was reported that cir  x-1 also exhibited the behaviors of atoll sources at lower intensity ( oosterbroek et al .",
    "the other is xte  j1701@xmath1462 , the first new z source in nearly 35 years , which was first detected with the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on january 18 , 2006 ( remillard & lin 2006 ) .",
    "homan et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2006b , 2007a ) suggested that xte  j1701@xmath1462 was a z source , because it exhibited typical cds of z sources , and its timing properties were also consistent with those of z sources .",
    "however , it was also reported that xte  j1701@xmath1462 evolved into an atoll source at the end of its outburst ( homan et al .",
    "2007b ) . as shown in figure 4 in the paper of homan et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , xte  j1701@xmath1462 showed two types of tracks on the cds : the `` z '' tracks and the `` @xmath0 '' tracks during the z - source stages .",
    "lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) analyzed the rxte observations of xte  j1701@xmath1462 during the 2006 - 2007 outburst and concluded that during the atoll - source stage the disk or neutron star ( ns ) evolved roughly along the @xmath6 track , both the inner disk radius and blackbody radius of the ns remained constant , and the inner disk radius , comparable with the ns radius , was set by the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "however , during the z - source stages the disk or ns departed from the @xmath6 track and the inner disk radius increased with the source intensity , which could be a signature of the local eddington limit in the disk .",
    "these results lead us to the thought that the magnetosphere of the ns could play a crucial role in the evolution of inner disk radius and disk structure .",
    "it is plausible that the inner edge of the disk can not go across the the isco or magnetospheric radius . during the atoll - source stage",
    ", the gas pressure from the disk pushes the magnetosphere to near the isco , so the inner disk radius is set by the isco .",
    "however , during the z - source stages , because the disk is thickened by the radiation pressure , the gas pressure from the disk decreases , magnetosphere expands , and then the inner disk radius increases .",
    "therefore , during the z - source stages the inner disk radius could be set by the magnetospheric radius and it should vary with the mass accretion rate ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) considered two scenarios for the relation between z and atoll sources : ( i ) the two types of sources are similar and their differences are due to the difference of their @xmath7 ; ( ii ) their differences are resulted from some additional parameters such as neutron star surface magnetic field strength , disk inclination , etc .",
    ", rather than @xmath7 .",
    "they argued that under scenario ( i ) , one could expect that in the cd the atoll and z patterns would evolve into each other in the sources with a large range in @xmath7 and these sources then switch between z and atoll behaviors . because this kind of evolution had never been observed , they excluded this scenario . therefore , they proposed scenario ( ii ) is responsible for the difference between atoll sources and z sources and suggested that both the mass accretion rate and neutron star surface magnetic field strength might be larger in z sources than in atoll sources , which might be due to different evolutionary history .",
    "however , it was observed that during the 2006 - 2007 outburst of xte  j1701@xmath1462 , the track in cd evolved from the `` z '' track , via the `` @xmath0 '' track , and finally to the atoll pattern ( lin , remillard , & homan 2009b ; homan et al .",
    "this finding thus strongly supports the first scenario considered by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) .",
    "xte  j1701@xmath1462 thus plays a role in linking between z and atoll sources ( lin , remillard , & homan 2009b ) . in order to understand this critical source more clearly and",
    "know how a z source evolves into an atoll source , its characteristics , including its mass accretion rate , the structure and evolution of the accretion disk , ns magnetic field , and hard x - ray emission are needed to be studied .",
    "the normal z sources exhibit complicated behaviors of hard tail ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2006 ; ding et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; iaria et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) , but so far the hard tail behaviors of xte  j1701@xmath1462 are unclear so far . the ns surface magnetic field strength is believed to be higher in z sources than in atoll sources ( focke 1996 ; zhang , yu , & zhang 1998 ) , whereas it is still unknown in xte  j1701@xmath1462 . during the 2006 - 2007 outburst of xte  j1701@xmath1462 , with dramatic change of its intensity ,",
    "it evolved from a cyg - like z source , via a sco - like z source , to an atoll source , so the evolution was likely linked to its mass accretion rate , rather than its magnetic field strength , because it was unlikely that its magnetic field strength varied in such a short term .",
    "since this transient z source evolves into an atoll source at low luminosity , it is natural to speculate that its magnetic field strength keeps unvaried during its evolution and it may be between the two types of nsxbs , although there is no obvious dichotomy between the magnetic field strengths in atoll and z sources , as implied by the scenario ( i ) of hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) .",
    "it is then understandable that at low or high accretion rates the source should appear as an atoll or a z source , if the above speculation is true .    in this work , using the data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) on board rxte satellite , we investigate the spectral evolution along a `` z '' track and a `` @xmath0 '' track on its hids of the first transient z source xte  j1701@xmath1462 , study its accretion disk structure and evolution , infer its ns surface magnetic field strength , and detect the anticipated hard tail .",
    "we describe our data analyses in  2 , represent the methods for us to estimate the ns magnetic field strength and mass accretion rates in  3 , discuss our results in  4 , and present our conclusions in  5 .",
    "we select two groups of observations for xte  j1701@xmath1462 to perform our analyses .",
    "the observations of the first group were made between 2006 january 21 and january 31 ( mjd 53,75653,766 ) and those of the second group were made between 2006 march 2 and march 7 ( mjd 53,79653,801 ) .",
    "the selected observations are listed in tables 1 and 2 . in order to produce cds and hids , following homan et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , we define the soft color as the ratio of count rates between the [ 4.07.3  kev ( channels 714 ) ] and [ 2.44.0  kev ( channels 36 ) ] energy bands , and the hard color as that between the [ 9.818.2  kev ( channels 2140 ) ] and [ 7.39.8  kev ( channels 1520 ) ] energy bands , and intensity as the count rate covering the energy range @xmath42.418.2  kev ( channels 340 ) . the colors and intensity are produced from the background - subtracted light curves with a time resolution of 16  s , which are produced from the `` standard 2 '' mode data from proportional counter unit ( pcu ) number 2 ( the most reliable of the five pcus ) .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the track in cd1 , produced from the first group observations , is divided into five branches which are , respectively , called as upturn hb ( uhb ) , hb , nb , fb , and low fb ( lfb ) .",
    "however , cd2 , produced from the second group observations , is only split into three branches , i.e. , hb , nb , and fb . these branches are converted into the corresponding branches in hid1 and hid2 , which are shown in figure 2 . as shown in figure 2 ,",
    "the tracks in hid1 and hid2 are , respectively , divided into eighteen regions and eleven regions , in order to minimize count rate variations within each of the 29 regions and produce the pca and hexte spectra of each region . in hid1 , uhb , hb , nb , fb , and lfb",
    "are composed of regions 13 , regions 49 , regions 1014 , regions 1516 , and regions 1718 , respectively ; in hid2 , regions 12 , regions 34 , and 511 separately belong to hb , nb , and fb .      the `` standard 2 '' mode data from pcu2 are used to extract the pca spectra .",
    "we use the `` standard '' mode hexte data to produce the hexte spectra .",
    "hexte comprises two clusters , cluster a and cluster b , each of which is composed of four detectors .",
    "generally , we use the data from cluster a to produce the hexte spectra , because detector 2 of cluster b loses its spectral capability and automatic gain control .",
    "however , in some cases , the background files can not be produced from the data of cluster a , so we have to use the data from cluster b to produce the hexte spectra , and in these cases , we discard the data from detector 2 of this cluster . in order to have sufficient statistics for the spectra , especially for the hexte spectra , all observation data within a region in the hids are combined together . in order to improve the quality of the hexte spectra , the hexte spectra are rebinned with the criterion : the minimum signal - noise ratio ( snr ) of per new bin is 2.5 .",
    "following the recipes for rxte data analysis , the pca and hexte background spectra are respectively produced , and then we get the background - subtracted pca+hexte spectrum of each of the 29 hid regions .",
    "using rxte observations for atoll source aql  x-1 and 4u  1608 - 52 , lin , remillard , & homan ( 2007b ) tested some commonly used nsxb spectral models such as bpl+mcd ( bpl : broken power law , bknpower in xspec ; mcd : multicolor disk , diskbb in xspec ) , comptt+mcd ( comptt : thermal comptonization , comptt in xspec ) , comptt+bb ( bb : single - temperature blackbody , bbodyrad in xspec ) , etc . , and evaluated their performance against desirability criteria , including @xmath6 for both the mcd and bb included in these models .",
    "they found that none of the classical models for thermal emission plus comptonization performed well in the soft state ( ss ) .",
    "instead , they devised a hybrid model : bb+bpl for the hard state ( hs ) and mcd+bb+cbpl ( cbpl : constrained bpl ) for the ss and found that in this model both mcd and bb produced @xmath6 tracks well and the bb emission area was roughly constant over a wide range of @xmath8 . in this model",
    ", the mcd is interpreted as the emission from the accretion disk and it provides the inner disk radius @xmath9 and the temperature at the inner disk radius @xmath10 ; the bb is used to describe the emission from the ns surface or the boundary layer between the inner disk and the ns , and it provides the bb temperature @xmath11 and bb radius @xmath12 .",
    "the bpl in the hs model represents the strong comptonization emission from a heavily comptonized disk , whereas the cbpl in the soft state model accounts for the weak comptonization emission from a very weakly comptonized disk .    applying their hybrid model developed for observations of atoll sources , lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) analyzed all the spectra of 866 observations during 2006 - 2007 outburst of xte  j1701@xmath1462 and investigated how this source evolved from a cyg - like z source , via a sco - like z source , and then to an atoll source .",
    "they divided the outburst into five stages . in stage",
    "iv , the source showed the characteristics of cyg - like and sco - like z sources , respectively , whereas it showed characteristics of an atoll source in stage v which included the ss and hs .",
    "their analyses suggested that during the z - source stages ( stages i  iv ) , the cbpl component contributed significantly when the source entered the uhb or hb , and the inclusion of such a component could not improve the fitting significantly for the spectra of the hb / nb vertex , nb , nb / fb vertex , and fb . in our analyses ,",
    "the observations of the first and second groups are within stage i ( the cyg - like z stage ) and stage ii ( a sco - like z stage ) , respectively . following the models used for the z - source stages ,",
    "which are showed in figure 13 in the paper of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) , we use the mcd+bb+cbpl ( cbpl : @xmath13  kev , @xmath14 ) model to fit the spectra of regions 19 in hid1 ( i.e. , the uhb and hb spectra in hid1 ) and the spectra of regions 12 in hid2 ( i.e. , the hb spectra in hid2 ) , with the cbpl component in this model to account for the hard tail .",
    "nevertheless , we use the mcd+bb model to fit the spectra of other regions .",
    "farinelli , titarchuk , & frontera ( 2007 ) proposed that weakening ( or disappearance ) of the hard x - ray tail could be explained by the increasing radiation pressure originated at the surface of the ns and used a model consisting of a bulk - motion comptonization ( bmc ) plus a comptt to fit the broadband spectra of gx  17 + 2 . in order to trace the origin of the hard x - ray emission in xte  j1701@xmath1462",
    ", we also use this model to fit the spectra of regions 19 in hid1 and the spectra of regions 12 in hid2 .",
    "we use xspec 12.5 to jointly fit the pca and hexte spectra of each of the 29 regions . due to the calibration uncertainties , a systematic error of 1%",
    "is added to the pca spectra , but not to the hexte spectra .",
    "the pca spectra are taken in 321 kev . in order to improve the snrs of the hexte channels , we rebin the 64 original hexte channels and then take the new bins which have snrs larger than 2.5 and ignore those bins with snrs smaller than 2.5 .",
    "the pca and hexte response matrices provided by rxte team are applied . a multiplicative constant representing the relative normalization between the instruments",
    "is added to the spectral model , for taking into account the uncertainties in the pca - hexte cross calibration .    a gaussian component , accounting for an iron emission line",
    ", is also included in our spectral models and the interstellar absorption is taken into account . following lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) ,",
    "the gaussian width @xmath15 of the line component and hydrogen column density @xmath16 of the interstellar absorption are fixed at 0.3 kev and @xmath17  @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) estimated that the orbital inclination is neither very high ( @xmath19 ) , due to absence of eclipses or absorption dips , nor very low because of the observed narrow equivalent width ( @xmath20  50 ev ) of the iron line .",
    "they thus assumed a binary inclination of @xmath21 of xte  j1701@xmath1462 . in our analyses , we also take the inclination angle to be @xmath21 . from the observed photospheric radius expansion , lin et al ( 2007a , 2009a ) estimated the distance to the source to be 8.8 kpc , which is also used in our analyses .",
    "the fitting results are listed in tables 3 and 4 , and some unfolded spectra are shown in figures 35 .",
    "figures 6 and 7 demonstrate some folded spectra and the corresponding residual distribution .",
    "figure 8 shows the evolution of the parameters along the `` z '' and `` @xmath0 '' tracks .",
    "we calculate the ratio of the cbpl flux to the total flux , and the fraction of cbpl is exhibited by figure 9 . in figure 10 , the luminosities of thermal components ( mcd / bb ) vs. their characteristic temperatures as well as the pca intensity are demonstrated , and the characteristic emission sizes of the thermal components vs. the pca intensity are also demonstrated .",
    "figure 11 shows how the source evolves along the `` z '' and `` @xmath0 '' tracks in the maps of the individual luminosity vs. total luminosity .",
    "lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) have shown that when the source is in the z - source stages , @xmath22 starts to increase with the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "they interpreted this as due to the local eddington luminosity of the disk emission is reached , i.e. , @xmath22 is determined by the local eddington luminosity ; this model would naturally predict @xmath23 .",
    "however , as shown in figure 19 of the paper of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) , @xmath22 increased only by a factor of 1.5 when @xmath24 increased from 0.4 to 0.9 , clearly deviating @xmath23 .",
    "this is understandable because the ns surface magnetic field strength and mass accretion rate ( @xmath7 ) are two important parameters of an accreting ns binary system ; however the model of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) did not take into account the interaction of the ns s magnetosphere with the accretion disk .    in this work",
    "we attempt to derive the surface magnetic field strength of the ns from the interaction between the magnetosphere and the accretion disk .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the inner edge of the accretion disk can not go across the surface of the magnetosphere or the isco .",
    "the magnetosphere will normally expand when @xmath7 decreases , for a given accretion disk structure . when the magnetospheric radius ( @xmath25 ) is greater than the isco ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ns mass ) , the inner disk radius ( @xmath22 ) is equal to the magnetospheric radius , i.e. , @xmath28 ( zhang , yu , & zhang 1998 ) .",
    "this scenario is shown in figure 12 . combining the equation ( 2 ) of cui ( 1997 ) and equation ( 18 ) of lamb , pethick , & pines ( 1973 ) , we get @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the surface magnetic field strength of the ns , @xmath32 is the thickness of the disk at @xmath22 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the radial and free - fall velocities at @xmath22 , respectively , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are separately the eddington accretion rate of xte  j1701@xmath1462 and the radius of the ns .",
    "the inner disk radius @xmath22 and disk mass accretion rate @xmath3 can be inferred from the mcd+bb+cbpl+line or mcd+bb+line model , with the known ns mass and radius ( @xmath37 ) , so the ns magnetic field strength can be estimated from above equation . because @xmath38 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 all depend upon the structure of the disk , so only @xmath39 can be inferred directly from observations , without knowing the details of the disk structure _ a prior_. for convenience , we call @xmath39 the apparent magnetic field strength of the ns .    in a keplerian disk , 50% of the available gravitational potential energy is converted into radiation at the inner disk boundary , thus the disk mass accretion rate is computed by the following equation , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath22 can be determined from @xmath42 and inner disk temperature @xmath43 by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the stefan s constant and @xmath46 is the color correction factor ( zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ) . combining the above two equations , we can then have , @xmath47 with the above equation , the best fitting value and the error of @xmath3 can be calculated directly from fitted parameters in the spectral model .    similarly , because almost all gravitational energy is converted into radiation at the surface of the ns , we can compute the mass accretion rate onto the ns using equation , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bb luminosity derived from the spectral models , @xmath50 , which is related to the ns equation of state .",
    "recent measurements of the masses and radii of several nss gave @xmath510.81.2 ( zel 2006 ; zel et al .",
    "2009 ; gver et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "we therefore take @xmath52  @xmath53 and @xmath54  cm throughout this paper , unless specified otherwise ; this gives @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath42 and @xmath49 are computed , a distance of 8.8  kpc to the source is taken ( lin et al .",
    "2007a , 2009a ) and the fluxes in the whole energy band are used .",
    "the fluxes below @xmath42 kev can not be estimated from the pca response matrix",
    ". however , the disk or ns flux below @xmath42 kev contributes a considerable portion in the whole energy band , because the inner disk temperature ( @xmath56 ) or bb temperature ( @xmath57 ) is lower than several kev .",
    "we therefore use the xspec command `` dummyrsp '' to create a dummy response matrix below @xmath42 kev and thus estimate the fluxes in the whole energy range .    in equation",
    "( 5 ) , if the luminosity is normalized to the eddington luminosity ( @xmath58 ) , the accretion rate will be normalized to the corresponding eddington accretion rate ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "lin et al . ( 2007a , 2009a ) reported that xte  j1701@xmath1462 revealed clear photospheric radius expansion during its second and third type - i x - ray bursts .",
    "the empirically determined eddington luminosity for radius expansion for a helium burst should be @xmath59  ergs  s@xmath60 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is regarded as the eddington luminosity of xte  j1701@xmath1462 ( @xmath58 ) and the corresponding @xmath35 of xte  j1701@xmath1462 should be @xmath61  @xmath62  yr@xmath60 .    in a radiation pressure dominated disk , the vertical gravity is balanced by radiation , as shown in figure 12 .",
    "then the thickness of the inner disk @xmath63 , and thus the density @xmath64 in the inner disk region is roughly independent of @xmath3 ( shakura & syunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that even for very high accretion rates , e.g. , @xmath65 , the vertical thickness of the inflowing part of the inner disk only reaches asymptotically to about the diameter of the ns , due to the increasing outflow as the total accretion rate increases ( ohsuga 2007 ) . therefore",
    ", for a constant @xmath64 and constant vertical thickness of the inflow , @xmath66 ( note @xmath3 throughout this paper describes only the inflow rate , not the total accretion rate that includes also the unseen outflow rate ) . we therefore have @xmath67 substitute equation ( 6 ) into equation ( 1 ) , we get , @xmath68 for a radiation pressure dominated disk interacting with a ns s magnetosphere .",
    "the bb component in the spectral models is interpreted as the emission from the ns surface , so the ns radius can also be derived from the bb temperature and bb luminosity and the derived ns radius should not be correlated with any parameter such as the disk accretion rate . due to the electron scattering on the ns surface",
    ", the observed x - ray spectrum at infinity has a higher temperature than the effective temperature , i.e. , a color correction must be taken .",
    "theoretical calculations have shown that the color correction factor is between 1.33 to 1.84 ( madej , joss , & raska 2004 ) . here",
    "we take the value of color correction factor as @xmath41.6 , since it results in an average value of around 10  km for the ns radius ( a slightly different choice of the color correction factor will not change any of our conclusions , since we are not interested in the precise value of the ns radius in this work ) .",
    "the inferred ns apparent magnetic field strength ( @xmath39 ) , accretion rates in the disk and onto the ns ( @xmath3 and @xmath69 ) , and the ns radius ( @xmath36 ) are listed in table 5 .",
    "figure 13 shows the correlations between @xmath3 and other inferred parameters , i.e. , @xmath22 , @xmath39 , @xmath69 , and @xmath36 . significance and implications of these quantities and their evolution will be discussed in the discussion section .",
    "figure 8 shows the evolution of the fitting parameters and mass accretion rates along the `` z '' track and `` @xmath0 '' track .",
    "looking at figure 8 , one can see that there is a transition region ( the green region ) along each of the two tracks and the fitting parameters or accretion rates evolve differently across the transition region .",
    "the transition regions of the `` z '' track and `` @xmath0 '' track are the nb region and the beginning section of the fb , respectively .",
    "this behavior may indicate that the disk structure is different before and after the transition regions , while the transition regions connect two different disk states .    as shown by panels",
    "c , d , e , and f in figure 8 , along the `` z '' or `` @xmath0 '' track , both the bb flux and bb radius basically remain stable before the transition region , but they begin to decrease in the transition regions , and continuously decrease after the transition regions . both the bb flux and bb radius are much smaller in fb than in hb , in other words , along the `` z '' or `` @xmath0 '' track the bb component contributes obviously less when the source ascends the fb .",
    "our results are consistent with those of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) . from the bb luminosity , interpreted as the emission from the ns ,",
    "we infer the mass accretion rate onto the ns .",
    "as shown by panels g and h in figure 8 , the mass accretion rate onto the ns is approximately a constant before the transition regions , but it begins to decrease in the transition regions .",
    "moreover , it is always less than the mass accretion rate through the inner accretion disk .",
    "there are two possibilities for the obviously small ns mass accretion rate .",
    "the first is that the ns is partially obscured by the accretion disk , so that only part of the ns surface is visible to the observer ; this is very likely unless the accretion disk is oriented close to face - on .",
    "furthermore , as will be discussed in the next subsection , the disk structure evolves substantially over these observations and thus the obscuration to the ns surface also changes accordingly , producing the observed variations of the inferred ns radius ; this is consistent with the suggestion of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2007b , 2009b ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the frequently observed dipping or flaring during the lfb and fb phase ( homan et al . 2007a ; shirey , bradt , & levine 1999 ; lin , remillard , & homan 2009b ) .",
    "as shown by panels a and b of figure 8 , along the `` z '' or `` @xmath0 '' track , both @xmath56 and @xmath57 do not change remarkably before the transition regions , and however , they evolve after the transition regions .",
    "the disk flux or total flux increases along each track before the transition regions , and after the transition regions , it decreases along the `` z '' track but increases slightly along the `` @xmath0 '' track , as demonstrated in panels c and d of figure 8 .",
    "we investigate the correlations between the luminosities of the thermal components and their characteristic temperatures , which are shown in the left panels of figure 10 .",
    "as shown in these panels , both the disk and ns do not follow the @xmath6 relationship .",
    "it is reasonable , because both the inner disk radius and bb radius evolve .",
    "as shown by the top panel of the right column of figure 10 , both @xmath22 and @xmath70 increase with the pca intensity in the hb .",
    "the increase of the inner disk radius indicates that during the z - source stages the boundary layer expands when the source intensity increases .",
    "however , during the atoll - source stages , both the disk and ns evolve roughly along the @xmath6 track and both @xmath22 and @xmath70 nearly remain constant ( lin , remillard , & homan 2009b ) .",

    "applying the model of van der klis ( 2001 ) to xte  j1701@xmath1462 , homan et al .",
    "( 2007a ) suggested that the position of the `` z '' track is determined by the ratio @xmath3/@xmath71 and the cd shape evolves as a function of decreasing @xmath7 . in this paper , we investigate the evolution of mass accretion rate along the `` z '' and `` @xmath0 '' tracks .",
    "as shown by panels g and h in figure 8 , along the `` z '' or `` @xmath0 '' track , the disk accretion rate increases before the transition region , but decreases after the transition region ; the ns accretion rate roughly keeps unvaried before the transition region , and like the disk accretion rate , it decreases after the transition region .",
    "the average disk and ns mass accretion rates of the `` z '' track are 7.50  @xmath35 and 0.11  @xmath35 , respectively , and those of the `` @xmath0 '' track are 2.09  @xmath35 and 0.01  @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "our results suggest that the mass accretion rates do not monotonically evolve along the `` z '' track or `` @xmath0 '' track in xte  j1701@xmath1462 and the source switches from the `` z '' track to the `` @xmath0 '' track when the mass accretion rates decrease , in agreement with the results of homan et al . (",
    "2010 ) .    finally , we point out that none of the fitting parameters monotonically evolves along the `` z '' or `` @xmath0 '' track , indicating that the hid tracks are not uniquely determined by only a single fitting parameter .      in this work ,",
    "we use the hybrid model of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2007b ) to fit the spectra of xte  j1701@xmath1462 during a cyg - like z episode ( the `` z '' track ) and a sco - like z episode ( the `` @xmath0 '' track ) . comparing the unfolded spectra shown in figures 3 and 4 with those shown in figure 13 in the paper of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b )",

    "in this figure , they showed the luminosities of thermal components ( mcd / bb ) vs. their characteristic temperatures as well as the pca intensity , also showed the emission sizes of the thermal component vs. the pca intensity .",
    "we show our results in figure 10 . comparing the two figures",
    ", we find that our results are in agreement with theirs in many aspects , for example , ( 1 ) @xmath72 vs. @xmath73 relations deviate from the @xmath74 track ; ( 2 ) in hb , both the mcd luminosity and bb luminosity increase with the pca intensity and both @xmath22 and @xmath70 also increase with the pca intensity ; ( 3 ) both the bb flux and bb radius decrease dramatically in fb .",
    "lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) found that in the fb during the sco - like z stages the disk evolved by closely following the @xmath75 track ( see section 4.3.2 and figure 15 of their paper ) , which they interpreted as a sign that the inner disk radius is varying under the condition of a constant @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the same issue .",
    "we fit the results of the fb of the `` @xmath0 '' track by using the least square method .",
    "contrary to what was found by them , we find that the disk evolves following the @xmath76 track in the fb during the sco - like z stage , which is demonstrated by the solid line in the bottom panel of the left column of figure 10 ( see the triangles around the solid line ) .",
    "the difference between ours and theirs may be due to that in our analyses we estimate the fluxes in the energy bands lower than the low limit of pca response matrix and use the disk luminosity in the whole energy band to calculate @xmath3 .",
    "the luminosity in the whole energy band is crucial for inferring @xmath7 , especially for deriving @xmath3 , because the temperature is below several kev .",
    "moreover , as shown by panel f in figure 8 , within the fb of the `` @xmath0 '' track the inner disk radius is variable , but the disk accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) is not a constant , as shown by panel h in figure 8 .",
    "figure 11 shows the correlations between the total luminosity and the luminosities of the thermal components as well as the disk mass accretion rate .",
    "baluciska - church et al . (",
    "2010 ) analyzed the spectra along a `` z '' track of cyg x-2 and investigated the same correlations .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results from the `` z '' track with those of theirs . as shown in the top panel of figure 4 in their paper , in the total luminosity vs. bb luminosity map , the results from the hb form a horizontal line , and in the corresponding map ( panel a in figure 11 )",
    ", the results from the uhb and hb also constitute a horizontal line approximately . from nb to fb , the bb luminosity continuously increases in cyg x-2 , whereas it continuously decreases from nb , via fb , to lfb in xte  j1701@xmath1462 .",
    "this comparison shows that the mechanism for producing the bb component is similar in the hbs in the two sources , but different in the nbs or fbs . as shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 in their paper and panel c in figure 11 here , in the the total luminosity vs. disk luminosity maps the two sources move along two similar tracks .",
    "however , it is interesting that on the tracks the two sources go along opposite directions . assuming the hb ( or uhb ) to be the beginnings of the tracks",
    ", one can see that cyg x-2 goes in the clockwise direction , while xte  j1701@xmath1462 moves counterclockwise .",
    "the similar shapes of the tracks may be due to that the longitudinal coordinates of the two panels all represent the disk emission .",
    "on the other hand , the contrary evolution directions might be contributed to the diversity of the mechanism for producing the disk emission . here",
    ", the disk emission of xte  j1701@xmath1462 is interpreted as the model of the multicolor disk blackbody , while the disk emission of cyg x-2 was explained by using the extended accretion disk corona ( adc ) model ( church & baluciska - church 2004 ; baluciska - church et al .",
    "2010 )      figure 13 shows the correlations between @xmath3 and several parameters of the accretion disk and ns , i.e. , the inner disk radius ( @xmath22 in panel a ) , the ns apparent magnetic field strength ( @xmath39 in panel b ) , the ns accretion rate ( panel c ) , and ns radius ( @xmath36 in panel d ) , respectively .",
    "panels a and b show that both @xmath22 and @xmath39 increase with @xmath3 .",
    "the dashed lines in panels b and a of figure 13 are @xmath77 and @xmath2 given in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , respectively ; clearly the model predictions agree with data well .",
    "therefore our results presented here support that the accretion disk is radiation pressure dominated and @xmath78 increases generally with @xmath3 .",
    "considering that the correlations in panels a and b of figure 13 hold across a range of @xmath3 by a factor of about ten , we therefore infer that the smallest values of @xmath38 @xmath79 are equal to or smaller than 0.1 ( because the largest value can not exceed unity ) , which roughly correspond to the thin disk model ( shakura & syunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the disk evolves from a thin disk at the lowest @xmath3 to a slim disk at the highest @xmath3 .",
    "our conclusion is qualitatively in agreement with the conclusion of lin , remillard , & homan ( 2009b ) , in which the local eddington luminosity determines the vertical structure of the disk .",
    "panels c and d in figure 13 show that for @xmath3 there are obviously two branches , i.e. , the upper and lower branches .",
    "the upper branch corresponds to the uhb and hb with a constant ns radius and slow increase of @xmath80 as @xmath81 increases from about 2 to about 10 . a rough fitting gives @xmath82 , indicating that a significant amount of inflowing matter in the inner disk does not reach the ns and",
    "thus must be ejected from the inner disk region as outflow .",
    "the lower branch corresponds to the lfb and fb , and the latter is connected to the hb by the nb .",
    "the much smaller @xmath80 and inferred ns radius suggest that very small amount of inflow matter can reach the ns and we only observe a small fraction of the ns surface .",
    "this suggests a much stronger outflow from the inner disk area and the outflow also blocks a significant fraction of the ns surface .",
    "inspecting panels a and b in figure 8 , we can see that @xmath57 also increases dramatically in fb and lfb , indicating that we are actually seeing the polar region of the ns , where the accretion column channeled by the dipole magnetic field causes a hotter radiation area .",
    "this picture is consistent with the frequently observed dipping or flaring phenomenon during the lfb and fb ( homan et al .",
    "2007a ; shirey , bradt , & levine 1999 ; lin , remillard , & homan 2009b ) .",
    "the ns surface magnetic field strength ( @xmath31 ) is a critical parameter for understanding the properties of different kinds of nss . in panel",
    "b of figure 13 , the largest value of @xmath39 is about @xmath83 g. because @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we obtain the lower limit to the surface magnetic field of the ns as @xmath86 g. considering uncertainties in both the data and model , we take @xmath87 g.    as discussed above , at high @xmath3 , significant outflow is produced , reducing significantly @xmath69 .",
    "shakura & syunyaev ( 1973 ) suggested that during the critical and super - eddington accretion state , the radiation pressure will make the inner disk region spherized and outflow is thus produced .",
    "the spherization radius is given by , @xmath88 where @xmath81 is the disk accretion rate , in unit of eddington accretion rate and @xmath89 is the mass of the compact object , in unit of solar mass @xmath90 . applying equation ( 8) to a nsxb and taking 1.4  @xmath91 as the ns mass",
    ", we get , @xmath92 clearly @xmath93 increases faster with @xmath3 than @xmath22 does ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this implies that at the lowest @xmath3 , the disk is terminated by the magnetic pressure of the ns ; however at the highest @xmath3 , the disk would be terminated ( spherized ) by the radiation pressure , if @xmath95 . because the highest @xmath96 for the `` z '' track of hid1 is above the eddington rate and @xmath97 km",

    "finally we get the upper limit to @xmath31 as @xmath105  g. considering uncertainties in both the data and model , we take @xmath106 g. we therefore get @xmath107  g , which is much higher than the reported @xmath31@xmath4(0.31)@xmath108  g of the atoll source aql  x-1 ( zhang , yu , & zhang 1998 ; campana 2000 ) , but very close to or just slightly lower than the reported @xmath109  g of the z source cyg  x-2 ( focke 1996 ) .",

    "the accretion disk was assumed to be geometrically thin .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the disk at such a low accretion accretion is an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) and is thus geometrically thick ( zhang , yu , & zhang 1998 ; menou et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case",
    ", less magnetic pressure is needed to cause the assumed `` propeller '' effect for the same accretion rate .",
    "therefore the reported @xmath31 of aql  x-1 is only an upper limit , i.e. , @xmath110(0.31)@xmath108  g for the atoll source aql  x-1 .",
    "the reported @xmath31 of cyg  x-2 ( focke 1996 ) was based on interpreting the observed horizontal - branch oscillations ( hbos ) with the beat frequency model of a spherical accretion ( van der klis et al .",
    "1985 ) ; the spherical accretion assumption tends to under - estimate @xmath31 , because more magnetic pressure is required to balance the gas pressure of a non - spherical accretion of the same accretion rate , i.e. , @xmath111  g for the z source cyg  x-2 .",
    "the above values of @xmath31 also agree with the theoretical modeling of the evolution of ns s surface magnetic field strength due to accretion , resulting in @xmath4@xmath112  g and @xmath4@xmath113  g for atoll and z sources , respectively ( zhang & kojima 2006 ; zhang 2007 ) . however , titarchuk , bradshaw & wood ( 2001 ) reported that three nss , namely , 4u  1728@xmath142 ( atoll source ) , gx",
    "340 + 0 ( z - source ) , and sco  x@xmath11 ( z - source ) , have similar , and very low surface magnetic field strengths of around @xmath114  g , based on their magneto - acoustic wave model for the observed kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) from nss .",
    "nevertheless it is possible that the ns surface magnetic field strength in xte  j1701@xmath1462 is between normal atoll and z sources , although the surface magnetic field has not been determined reliably for most atoll and z sources .",

    "in addition to this explanation , some other interpretations have been proposed , such as due to synchrotron emission ( damico et al .",
