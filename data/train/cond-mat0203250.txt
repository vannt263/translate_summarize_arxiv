    "the generalization of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) to slowly relaxing systems , such as glasses , is an issue of foremost importance for understanding non - equilibrium processes .",
    "ordinary fdt relates the autocorrelation @xmath1 and the integrated response @xmath4 functions , which both depend in equilibrium on the time difference @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the time elapsed after the sample preparation .",
    "a general feature of slow kinetics , instead , is the aging property , namely the dependence of the time - scale of relaxation on the time @xmath6 .",
    "this feature generally shows up both in @xmath1 and @xmath4 . in the context of mean - field models for spin glasses",
    "it was shown  @xcite that , for large @xmath6 , @xmath0 depends on the two times through the autocorrelation function alone ( t , t_w)=. [ cug ] this property holds quite generally in a wide class of aging systems where deviations from the ordinary equilibrium fdt , namely @xmath7 , result in a nontrivial fluctuation dissipation ratio @xmath8 .",
    "recently , a theorem has been proven  @xcite linking @xmath9 to static properties .|_c = q = p(q ) [ statdin ] where @xmath10 is the equilibrium probability distribution of the overlaps .",
    "this opens the way to a classification of aging systems according to the structure of their equilibrium states  @xcite and to the recognition that the properties of the response to a perturbation are universal in systems sharing the same overlap distribution .",
    "the ordering process of ferromagnetic systems provides a simplified framework for the study of the off - equilibrium fdt because the main features of slow relaxation are fully exhibited but the structure of their equilibrium state is simple and exactly known .",
    "while  ( [ cug ] ) is generally obeyed  @xcite , the validity of  ( [ statdin ] ) in this case depends on dimensionality . for @xmath11 , ( [ statdin ] ) holds asymptotically , implying the same fluctuation dissipation ratio , and hence of @xmath2 , for all these systems  @xcite .",
    "this applies , in particular , to different dynamical realizations of the same hamiltonian model such as ferromagnets with non - conserved ( ncop ) or conserved ( cop ) order parameter  @xcite .",
    "however the picture is totally different in the case of the ising chain .",
    "with ncop ,  ( [ statdin ] ) is not obeyed  @xcite and , instead , a non trivial @xmath9 is found  @xcite that can not be connected to static properties .",
    "these results suggest that the nature of @xmath9 is essentially dynamical in this case .",
    "a natural question , then , is about which properties of the kinetics are reflected by @xmath2 . in order to address this point",
    ", we study in this paper the response of the one - dimensional ising model with kawasaki spin - exchange dynamics quenched to a low temperature , in the scaling regime preceding equilibration . in this case",
    "the order parameter is conserved and the microscopic mechanism whereby coarsening of domains is produced differs completely from the dynamics with single spin flip . with ncop interfaces are independent brownian walkers whose density is progressively reduced due to annihilation events . with cop , instead , the motion of interfaces is mediated by evaporation , diffusion and recondensation of single monomers . despite this completely different character of the dynamics ,",
    "we show that @xmath2 is the same for cop and ncop . due to the violation of the hypotheses of theorem  ( [ statdin ] ) this universal character can not be traced back to statics but it is more likely to have a common dynamical origin . since the basic coarsening mechanisms with cop or ncop are profoundly different , other kinetic properties , of a more general and fundamental nature , determine @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis carried out in this article shows that the total response can be viewed as due to the elementary contributions given by single domains . in the kinetic process",
    "domains coarsen and translate and the complex interplay between these two mechanisms produces the response .",
    "starting from this idea we introduce simple models where a single domain is allowed to diffuse in a random environment . in this framework , the elementary response generated by the domain can be studied and from its knowledge the behavior of the original ising chain is inferred by means of scaling arguments .",
    "the details of the rules for the motion do not change the overall behavior of the response .",
    "this approach provides a clear physical interpretation of how the response is produced in the ising model .",
    "these considerations are of a general nature and apply , in principle , to any dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "the occurrence in @xmath12 of an off - equilibrium response which never vanishes , as opposed to the cases with @xmath11 , is due to the special character of domain walls motion in one dimension .",
    "actually , in @xmath11 the evolution of a domain is the result of two competing drives .",
    "the first is the tendency to lower surface tension by making interfaces straight .",
    "the second is the drift towards regions where the random field is favorable . for long times the first mechanism always prevails , and",
    "the response generated by the drift of domains is negligible  @xcite . in @xmath12 ,",
    "instead , domain walls are point - like and surface tension does not play any role ; moreover the drift mechanism is so efficient as to generate a non - vanishing response even in the limit of large times , when the interface density decreases to zero .",
    "this paper is organized in six sections .",
    "section  [ unpe ] is devoted to a description of the cop dynamics of the unperturbed ising chain . in section  [ pert ]",
    "the effects of a perturbation are discussed and the response function is introduced , showing the analogy with the ncop dynamics and the universality of @xmath2 .",
    "models for a single diffusing domain are discussed in sections  [ onerigid ] and  [ twokawa ] , where scaling arguments are presented to illustrate the common origin of the response within the two types of dynamics . in section  [ conclu ]",
    "we discuss the relevance of our results for different systems and draw some conclusions .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional ising model with ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor coupling constant , whose hamiltonian is _ 0(\\{s_i } ) = -j_i=1 ^n s_i s_i+1 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the system is quenched from an uncorrelated high temperature equilibrium state to the final temperature @xmath14 .",
    "evolution takes place through kawasaki spin - exchange dynamics , i.e. swaps between antiparallel nearest - neighbor spins . in this way",
    "magnetization is a conserved quantity .",
    "the model describes lattice gases or binary alloys .",
    "the probability of exchanging @xmath15,@xmath16 is assumed to be p_t=[flipprob ] where @xmath14 is measured in units of the boltzmann constant and @xmath17 is the energy change .",
    "the basic features of the dynamics following an instantaneous quench are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "depending on the energy change elementary moves can be distinguished into three classes with @xmath18 .",
    "the first kind of process is evaporation , namely the separation of a spin from the boundary of a domain .",
    "processes with @xmath19 are the diffusion of a single spin ( monomer ) in the bulk of a domain of the other phase .",
    "when a diffusing monomer reaches an interface a condensation event occurs : the spin joins a domain .",
    "this process implies an energy change @xmath20 .",
    "evaporation is an activated process occurring over a characteristic time @xmath21 . for low temperatures",
    "@xmath22 is large and one observes a long interval @xmath23 during which evaporation practically does not happen .",
    "in this regime a reduction of the kink density @xmath24 can be obtained only by the diffusion and condensation of the monomers present in the initial state . in order to do this",
    "single spins move a distance of the order of the initial coherence length @xmath25 in a typical time @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to a decay  @xcite of the density of diffusing single spins over a characteristic time @xmath27 .",
    "in the case we are concerned with , a quench from very high temperature , @xmath28 is of order unity and one observes a fast decay to a plateau on short time - scales ( fig .  [ rho ] ) . in the regime",
    "@xmath29 no diffusing spins are left and @xmath30 remains constant . at times of order @xmath22",
    "evaporation events begin to occur and the dynamics _ restarts _ ( fig .",
    "[ rho ] ) . evaporated spins diffuse and they may recondense on a kink different from the one where they were emitted .",
    "this is the well known mechanism leading to the decay @xmath31@xcite : in this regime , dynamic scaling is obeyed .",
    "this behavior lasts until @xmath32 such that @xmath33 , the equilibrium kink density . at this time domains reach a size such that a second monomer is emitted when the first one is still diffusing .",
    "when they meet they form a stable dimer and this process exactly balances the domain annihilation due to the evaporation - condensation mechanism , so that @xmath34 keeps its equilibrium value . regarding the data presented in fig",

    "actually , the value @xmath58 may indicate that the value @xmath59 could be asymptotically correct . in order to check this point lower temperatures and larger waiting times should be considered . by plotting @xmath1 against @xmath60",
    "we have checked that also the curve with @xmath61 gives the same exponent @xmath62 , whereas the smaller exponent observed in fig .",

    "a second important observation , regarding figure  [ auto ] , is the convergence of @xmath1 towards the scaling behavior @xmath65 , as expected quite generally for slow relaxation  @xcite and in particular for coarsening systems  @xcite .",

    "we consider the integrated response function ( t , t_w)= _ 0 _ i=1^n , [ resp ] where @xmath75 denotes average in presence of the external field . before discussing the response of the model with cop , let us briefly recall the behavior with ncop . in this case equilibrium",
    "is reached because spins are flipped spontaneously in the bulk of ordered domains ; the characteristic time for this process is @xmath76 .",
    "the asymptotic value of the response function is the equilibrium susceptibility _ eq=1/t , [ equi ] namely @xmath77 . in equilibrium",
    "the bulk of domains is responsible for the response because spins anti - aligned with the random field are more likely to be reversed by thermal excitations .",
    "however , for times @xmath78 spins in the bulk do not flip ; the response observed in this regime is then of non - equilibrium nature .",
    "since the bulk is frozen , @xmath0 must be provided by interfaces .",
    "specifically the motion of kinks is such as to optimize the position of domains with respect to the random field , building up a finite response  @xcite .",
    "the range of times over which the non - equilibrium pattern is observed can be expanded by letting @xmath79 ( keeping @xmath69 small , for linear response theory to hold ) , or @xmath80 .",

    "the exponent @xmath64 differs from the value  @xcite @xmath99 for glauber dynamics .",

    "[ fdtncop ] and  [ fdtcop ] . comparing the two figures",

    "then , on the basis of what is known with ncop , we expect in the zero temperature limit the master - curve to be followed down to @xmath102 .",
    "let us stress that the correlation and the response functions _ are different _ for the two dynamics .",
    "only when the response @xmath4 is expressed as a function of the correlation @xmath1 one obtains _ the same _ fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath3 .",
    "the universality of the non - equilibrium response with respect to the type of dynamics naturally raises the question of a possible common fundamental origin .",
    "as proposed in section  [ intro ] , this must be of a dynamical character , since the connection  ( [ statdin ] ) between statics and @xmath3 can not be invoked in @xmath12 .",
    "the main dynamical feature of phase - ordering is the presence of a coarsening structure with many competing domains .",
    "this suggests to look for the underlying universality in the response of a single domain to the perturbation .",
    "in order to test this idea , in the following sections we investigate simplified models for the motion of a single domain . underlying this approach is the assumption that @xmath0 of the whole system can be seen as the sum of the response of single domains considered independent .",
    "correlations between domains are only responsible for the growth of their typical size . in this way we are able to identify the diffusive wandering of domains as the origin of the non - equilibrium response , both for ncop and cop dynamics .",

    "the weakening of the drift of domains limits their motion so that @xmath114 grows more slowly than @xmath130 . as a result @xmath154 and",
    "the response produced in this way , from  ( [ chising ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , vanishes .",

    "we have obtained the formula  ( [ chising ] ) for the response .",
    "the connection with the ising model was then made possible by scaling arguments where @xmath155 and @xmath130 were assumed _ a priori _ to behave as in the ncop or cop ising model .",
    "the dynamics of the rod however is quite different from the actual behavior of the ising model , where generally domains do not move as a whole .",
    "furthermore , while diffusion is the mechanism whereby interfaces move in the ising model with ncop , as stated by  ( [ deltancop ] ) , with cop the law  ( [ deltacop ] ) is obeyed , showing a non brownian character . despite these shortcomings of the model , we have obtained a good description of the ising chain and this suggests that the actual details of the dynamics are irrelevant .",
    "in this section we introduce an improved single - domain model which takes into account the different kinetics for ncop and cop .",
    "in particular , for cop , the evaporation - condensation mechanism which rules the evolution is taken into account .",
    "we study an ising chain of size @xmath156 with periodic boundary conditions and two interfaces initially located in @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "we consider both spin - flip and spin - exchange dynamics , and require the initial structure with only two domains of opposite sign to be preserved at all times .",
    "this condition is guaranteed if the temperature is low enough .",
    "however simulations at very low @xmath14 would be numerically too demanding , in particular for cop . for this reason we implement the aforementioned condition in a different way : with ncop we let @xmath96 by forbidding flips in the bulk . for cop we use a modified dynamics where new dimers are not allowed to form .",
    "specifically , when two monomers meet , one of the two particles is removed and attached randomly to another kink . with these rules",
    "a configuration with only two domains persists .",
    "let us focus on one of the two domains , indicated with @xmath159 , with the center located in @xmath160 . with cop",
    "the system evolves via exchanges of monomers between the two boundaries of @xmath159 . since at low @xmath14 at most",
    "one monomer is present the size @xmath161 of @xmath159 is practically conserved . with ncop , on the other hand , interfaces diffuse independently and the size changes .",

    "let us comment on the relationship between this approach and the one presented in the previous section .",
    "an obvious difference is the presence of two domains instead of one .",

    "this is what happens if interfacial spins simply _",
    "polarize _ according to the random field on a microscopic time - scale . on the other hand , from the knowledge of the behavior of the one - dimensional case , we know that the wandering of interfaces gives rise to a single - interface response growing as @xmath191 .",
    "therefore a natural interpretation is the following : curvature , which is absent in @xmath12 becomes progressively more important as @xmath192 increases , due to the coordination number .",
    "the attempt to lower surface tension weakens the drift of domain walls and inhibits the response mechanism associated with it .",
    "this progressively increases the value of @xmath188 with respect to @xmath12 as dimensionality is increased .",
    "then , for @xmath190 the motion of domain walls is fully governed by curvature whereas , for @xmath193 the drift mechanism partly compensate the decrease of @xmath30 , resulting in a smaller exponent @xmath188 . only at the lower critical dimension @xmath12 , however , this mechanism is so efficient as to balance exactly the loss of interfaces yielding @xmath194 and an asymptotic finite limit @xmath90 .",

    "the possible universality of the out of equilibrium response in higher dimensionality and the generality of the scaling form  ( [ scalci ] ) are interesting issues which deserve to be investigated in the future .    as a final comment",

    "spins basically rotate rather than flip and this is totally different with respect to scalar systems .",
    "the absence of bulk and interfaces prevents a straightforward extension of the concepts developed in this paper and the mechanisms by which the response is built up in the vectorial case is complex and still not well understood .",
    "however , the exact computation of the response function in the solvable large-@xmath156 model  @xcite has recently shown a pattern which resembles the behavior of scalar systems .",

    "this close analogy with the scalar case shows that , although the microscopic dynamics is different , the same competition between two mechanisms for the development of the response exists probably for every value of @xmath156 and that the same scaling relation  ( [ scalci ] ) holds .",
