    "the paramagnetic , as well as the antiferromagnetic phase ( and the corresponding quantum phase transition ) , were detected by measuring the probability to have an odd occupation of sites , while the formation of magnetic domains was observed using in - situ site - resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements  @xcite .",

    ", the numerical determination of the superfluid to charge - density - wave and superfluid to mott - insulator phase transitions ( respectively corresponding , in the effective xxz chain , to @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) well agrees with the analytical results for the xxz chain . using our approach",
    ", we are able not only to provide analytical expressions for the 1d bh correlation functions , but also to show that the bh chain at half - integer filling provides a reliable quantum simulator of the xxz chain .    in the following we derive an effective spin-1/2 hamiltonian for the bh chain at half - integer filling as a power series of @xmath37",

    "let us start by reviewing the basic properties of the bh and of the spin-1/2 xxz hamiltonians , in particular focusing on known analytical results about the real - space spin correlations in the xxz chain .",
    "the low - energy properties of interacting bosons in a one - dimensional deep optical lattice are in general well described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  ( [ ham_gen ] ) , which , in 1d and with open boundaries , reads : @xmath46 we denote with @xmath47 the total number of particles in the @xmath1-site chain , so that the filling @xmath23 , that is , the average number of particles per site , is given by @xmath48 .",
    "for alkali atoms usually @xmath49 , but with dipolar gases ( or polar molecules ) @xmath12 could be comparable with @xmath0 : experiments with dipolar gases  @xcite and long - lived ground - state polar molecules  @xcite in optical lattices have been already performed ( see also the review in ref .  ) .",
    "a large amount of experiments investigated the properties of the bh model : the main reason for this interest lies on the fact that this model exhibits a quantum phase transition between a superfluid phase ( for @xmath50 ) and a mott insulator ( for @xmath13 )  @xcite .",
    "a finite @xmath12 generally favours charge - density - wave phases : e.g. , for half - integer filling @xmath51 , a large @xmath52 will result in a ground - state of the type @xmath53 ( where in general @xmath54 is an eigenfunction of @xmath39 with @xmath40 ) .",
    "the ground - state of the bh model has been studied in the seminal paper in ref .   using the grand - canonical ensemble , where the chemical potential @xmath55 is introduced to enforce the constraint on the number of particles .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath56 plane shows the characteristic lobes : for a pertinently fixed value of @xmath55 , the half - integer fillings correspond to the `` basis '' of the lobes ( i.e. where the lobes touch ) and , for @xmath57 , one has a superfluid for each finite value of @xmath11 , while a finite and positive value of @xmath12 gives rise to a charge - density - wave region among the mott lobes .",
    "the mott - insulator / superfluid transition was first observed in 3d  @xcite and subsequently in 1d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite .",
    "the effect of a superimposed external potential ( typically a parabolic one ) has been also considered : the so - called wedding - cake - like density has been studied both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the coherence properties of ultracold bosons in optical lattices have been studied , as well , showing that phase coherence on short length scales still persists deep in the insulating phase  @xcite . the bh model in a 1d geometry",
    "can be obtained either by tightly confining the bosonic cloud in two radial directions in presence of a periodic potential in the transverse direction , or by creating many ( eventually uncoupled ) tubes with a 2d optical lattice .",
    "the properties of strongly correlated phases across the superfluid to mott - insulator phase transition have been analyzed in 1d by means of bragg spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the excitation spectrum in the strongly interacting regime has been also studied in presence of a tunable disorder , created by a bichromatic optical lattice , showing a broadening of the mott - insulator resonances  @xcite .",
    "the finite-@xmath12 1d bh model has been studied with a number of analytical and numerical techniques : in particular in ref .",
    "the phase boundaries of the mott insulators and charge - density - wave phases were determined by dmrg . the zero - temperature phase diagram",
    "both of the bh model and of a spin - s heisenberg model was constructed and their relation investigated  @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath12 in inducing supersolid phases in the bh chain was also studied  @xcite .",
    "bosonization techniques have been applied as well to bh chains , providing a very effective way to compute the correlation functions and their decay at large distance  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we mention that the effect of intersite interactions was considered since the 90 s in the related quantum phase model , describing josephson junction arrays  @xcite : this can be obtained from the bh model for large filling per site when the number fluctuations are negligible in the kinetic term .",
    "the chemical potential term in the bh model corresponds to the so - called `` offset charge '' @xmath58 , which are external charges present in the superconducting network  @xcite : the lobes in the quantum phase model are equal , since there is an invariance for @xmath59 ( @xmath60 being the charge of the cooper pairs ) , and an half - integer value of the filling @xmath23 corresponds to half - integer values of the offset charges @xmath61 .",
    "the study of intersite interactions is relevant in josephson junction arrays since the interaction term depends on the capacitance matrix @xmath62 , which is in general not diagonal , resulting in terms of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 : as a mean - field analysis shows  @xcite , for a diagonal capacitance matrix one has that at @xmath65 the superconducting phase is obtained for each value of the josephson energy @xmath66 ( @xmath67 in the mapping ) and that at @xmath68 one has a finite critical temperature for the mott - insulator / superfluid transition for each finite value of @xmath66 ( unlike @xmath69 , where a critical value of @xmath66 is required ) .",
    "non - diagonal terms of the capacitance matrix favour charge density waves  @xcite : the role of the intersite terms was considered for superconducting chains and the corresponding phase diagram investigated  @xcite , revealing that in 1d a ( superconducting ) repulsive luttinger liquid phase exists .",
    "the opening of luttinger liquid phases with tunable parameters also allows for designing josephson junction networks supporting emerging two - level quantum systems with a high level of quantum coherence @xcite .    to conclude this section",
    "let us mention that , in the rest of the paper , we will mostly deal with half - integer fillings , @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "the reason for such a choice is that in this case the relevant states for the description of system for @xmath22 are just @xmath26 and @xmath72 .",
    "simple arguments , reviewed in sec .",
    "[ xxzmodel_0 ] , then show that , to first order in @xmath37 , the bh hamiltonian is mapped into an xxz spin-1/2 hamiltonian which is integrable in 1d . within the xxz - model framework ,",
    "it is also possible to consider small deviations from the half - filled regime , which mainly give rise to a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath73-direction .",
    "even though we will not consider large fluctuations in @xmath23 ( of order 1 ) , it is possible to take them into account , by keeping , as relevant states for @xmath22 , @xmath26 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 . in this case , an effective spin-1 xxz effective model ( in general not integrable ) is expected  @xcite .",

    "since we are rather interested to the bh at half - integer filling , i.e. , in the region of the phase diagram where the lobes touch and the superfluid phase persists also at very small @xmath0 ( with @xmath57 ) , we found it convenient to use an approach based on continuous unitary transformations  @xcite .",
