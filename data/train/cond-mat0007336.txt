    "one dimensional systems are one of",
    "the few known example of non - fermi liquid behavior@xcite .",
    "it is thus of utmost theoretical importance to understand how one can go from a one dimensional situation to a more conventional high ( typically three ) dimensional one by coupling one dimensional systems , allowing particles to jump from chain to chain .",
    "this question is far from being elucidated despite several theoretical attempts . for commensurate one dimensional system",
    "another phenomenon appears : such systems are mott insulators .",
    "this leads to a direct competition between interactions and hopping .",
    "the insulating behavior of the one dimensional system tends to kill the interchain hopping and thus to confine the electrons on individual chains .",
    "conversely , a large interchain hopping destroys the one - dimensional character and thus weakens the mott transition considerably , turning the system into a metal .",
    "this competition between the mott transition and interchain hopping has in addition to its theoretical importance , implications for organic compounds @xcite that are three dimensional stacks of quarter filled chains@xcite .    unfortunately studying an infinite number of coupled chains is extremely difficult , so to understand such phenomenon it is interesting to investigate simpler systems with a finite number of coupled chains .",
    "such systems are the so - called ladders@xcite .",
    "they present the advantage to allow a careful study of the effects of hopping by being tractable by powerful analytical and numerical techniques . for commensurate ladders with spin ,",
    "the relevance of interchain hopping was studied by renormalization group techniques @xcite .",
    "depending on the ratio between the single chain mott gap and the interchain hopping ( suitably renormalized by the interactions ) a very different flow of the single particle hopping was observed , reminiscent of the confinement - deconfinement transition expected for the infinite number of chains , even if in the ladder there is no real transition but a simple crossover @xcite .",
    "in addition , interchain hopping was shown to drastically modify the critical properties of the mott transition @xcite compared to the one of a single chain . despite these studies on commensurate ladders a detailed description of the phase diagram and of the nature of the mott transition is still lacking .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate these issues on a ladder of spinless fermions .",
    "spinless fermions exhibit extremely interesting behavior since a single chain needs a finite repulsive interaction before turning into a mott insulator , contrarily to the spinful chain for which any repulsive interaction freezes the charge leaving only the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "one could thus naively think to be able to go from an insulating phase , dominated by the single chain gap , to a metallic phase even for repulsive interactions .",
    "in fact , quite interestingly , for the spinless ladder the mott transition is pushed in the vicinity of the non - interacting point , invalidating this naive picture .",
    "quite fortunately the fact that the mott transition is now in the vicinity of the non interacting point allows to study it using standard renormalization group technique , and extract the complete properties of the transition .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model for the two leg spinless ladder . in section  [ sec : rg ] we study this model using the renormalization group technique .",
    "we show that the mott transition occurs now for arbitrary repulsive interactions and compute the various physical parameters ( charge gap , luttinger liquid parameters ) both analytically and by a numerical integration of the rg equations .",
    "we analyse the phase diagram in section  [ sec : phasediag ] .",
    "we show that in the ladder the confinement - deconfinement is in fact a crossover .",
    "we also investigate the properties of the slightly doped ladder and point out the differences that exist compared to a doped single chain .",
    "conclusions can be found in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . finally some technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "we start from spinless electrons on a two leg ladder , described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the chain index . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the intra and interchain hopping , and @xmath6 the repulsion between nearest neighbors particles .    to analyze the long distance properties of this model",
    "it is convenient to use the boson representation of fermions operators @xcite , valid in one dimension .",
    "two basis are possible : ( i ) one can start in the original chain basis and bosonize each chain ; ( ii ) one can use the bonding and antibonding basis .",
    "each basis has advantages and drawbacks and we will need both to tackle the mott transition in the ladder , so we give both boson representations below .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature for the boson mapping and recall here only the main steps to fix the notations . taking a linearized energy dispersion at the fermi level , we use the following expressions for right and left moving fermions @xcite",
    ". @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 are canonically conjugate operators and @xmath10 . @xmath11 and @xmath12 give respectively the long wavelength fluctuations of the density and current .",
    "we note @xmath13 klein factors which one must introduce to reproduce the anticommutation properties of several fermion species@xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is a short distance cutoff of the order of the lattice spacing . with these operators",
    "the single chain hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "h_{int } & = & g \\int dx ( \\partial_{x } \\phi)^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ h_u&=&-2g_{u}\\int\\frac{dx}{(2\\pi a)^2 } \\cos(4\\phi ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the bare fermi velocity and the interaction .",
    "they are given by @xmath18 the umklapp part , @xmath19 , only appears in this form at half - filling @xcite(i.e . when @xmath20 ) and is responsible for the mott transition of a single chain .",
    "the interaction @xmath17 can be absorbed in the quadratic part to give the luttinger hamiltonian @xmath21\\ ] ] the parameters of the hamiltonian are the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath22 , the luttinger @xmath23 parameter and the non - universal umklapp coupling constant . for small @xmath6",
    "these parameters can be perturbatively computed : @xmath24 however the description ( [ limcontinue ] ) is much more general and is valid even at large coupling provided the proper renormalized coupling constant are used .",
    "in fact in the following we will not assume such relations for the coupling constants and take @xmath25 as a free parameter ( the parameters may be tuned at will with for example a second nearest - neighbor interaction ) .    using the bosonized expression ( [ limcontinue ] ) for the single chain",
    ", we can write the two uncoupled chains in ( [ teve ] ) as @xmath26 where we define @xmath27    the interchain hopping in ( [ teve ] ) reads in this basis @xmath28    this basis has the advantage to treat very simply the umklapp term , but has the drawback not to reproduce easily the band picture of free fermions .",
    "another basis is the bonding - antibonding band basis .",
    "we first diagonalize the kinetic energy in ( [ teve ] ) with @xmath29 and the corresponding boson fields . in this basis",
    "the interchain hopping is diagonal : @xmath30 however the interaction term is less simple to formulate . rather than to use the bonding and antibonding boson fields it is again convenient to introduce the symmetric and antisymmetric combination that we denote now @xmath31 and @xmath32 to distinguish them from the ones in the chain basis .",
    "this leads to the simple bosonized expression : @xmath33 the change of basis for the interaction term can be most easily performed using the transformation formulas for the total charge current .",
    "@xmath34    since",
    "the interaction terms are quadratic in currents we also need an operator product expansion to extract the most relevant operators .",
    "@xmath35 the expression for the anti - symmetric current is however misleading since it does not include klein factors required to identify bosonic exponents to anticommuting fermions@xcite . to obtain the exponential terms",
    "it is necessary to read the bosonized expression on the transformed four fermion operators@xcite . with these boson operators",
    "the interaction term takes the following form@xcite : @xmath36 and the umklapp term is @xmath37 we now define the coupling constant @xmath38 associated with the operator @xmath39 .",
    "let us now analyse the mott transition .",
    "the single chain needs a finite strength interaction in order to become an insulator .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from ( [ limcontinue ] ) , for a single chain the umklapp term has a dimension @xmath41 .",
    "it thus opens a gap in the charge sector and leads to a mott insulating phase for @xmath42 and a metallic ( luttinger liquid ) phase for @xmath43 . for the t - v model this corresponds to @xmath44 . in the ladder",
    "the presence of interchain hopping dramatically modifies this .",
    "as we will show , the ladder is an insulator for infinitesimal repulsive interactions .",
    "this can be easily seen by looking in the chain basis at the operators generated by @xmath5 .",
    "obviously @xmath5 will generate terms such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "note that these terms only contain the antisymmetric field .",
    "however when combined with the umklapp ( [ eq : hint ] ) the @xmath45 will generate a @xmath47 .",
    "this term has the dimension @xmath48 , and in contrast with the single chain umklapp , is relevant for @xmath49 leading to a gap in the symmetric sector and hence to a mott insulating phase .",
    "the perpendicular hopping thus reinforces the insulating character of the system .    to go beyond this simple argument",
    "let us now investigate the full rg flow using a two scale analysis of the relevant operators in the hamiltonian .",
    "let us first focus for values of @xmath23 for which the single chain would be metallic",
    ". in that case single chain umklapp operator ( [ limcontinue ] ) is irrelevant .",
    "the gap in this regime thus results from the competition of the initial decrease of the umklapp constant in the flow and its subsequent growth after @xmath5 has blocked the transverse fluctuations .    to investigate the gap",
    "let us write the full rg equations , which include the umklapp term .",
    "near the non - interacting point , if @xmath5 is small the flow is given by @xmath51 where we have set @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) to keep the notations simple .",
    "for @xmath54 these equations reduce to the ones obtained in ref .  .",
    "we have introduced couplings which are generated during the flow , though they are not present in the bare hamiltonian : @xmath55 these new couplings are @xmath56 which is a density - density interaction between the two chains and @xmath57 which is the umklapp part of this interaction .",
    "the coupling @xmath58 transfers a pair of fermion from one chain to the other and corresponds to a josephson coupling between the two chains .    for a finite value of the renormalised @xmath5 that depends on the initial fermi velocity and interactions , one can neglect the interaction terms that couple the two bands in a non - resonant way . hence we can use the above flow equations up to a lengthscale @xmath59 where @xmath5 reaches this finite value , @xmath60 . above the scale @xmath59 , it is more convenient to switch to the two band basis in order to study the flow . by definition of @xmath59",
    "we discard any term that contains @xmath61 , since such terms transfer momentum among the bands .",
    "above @xmath59 the flow becomes @xmath62 in the @xmath63sector the remaining @xmath64 term opens a gap .",
    "we note @xmath65 the scale when the coupling term @xmath64 has flowed to a value of order one , and the gap amplitude is evaluated as @xmath66 . above the scale @xmath65",
    "the umklapp operator becomes relevant since it is reduced to a simple @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 these equations describe completely the mott transition in the ladder system .",
    "an analytical solution can be given both in the limit of very small interchain hopping and for large interachain hopping but in the limit of very small interactions .",
    "a numerical integration of the equations allows to obtain the gap for arbitrary initial parameters .      since the umklapp is irrelevant for a single chain",
    ", one can replace the flow , when @xmath5 is the smallest scale in the problem , by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the renormalized luttinger parameter for a single chain . for the @xmath72 model @xmath71",
    "can be obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "when @xmath73 we switch to the second set of flow equations ( [ eq : flowlarge ] ) .",
    "we do not know the precise renormalization of the umklapp constant between @xmath59 and @xmath65 .",
    "but since @xmath74 does not depend on @xmath5 , this gives a simple multiplicative constant .",
    "above @xmath65 we use ( [ eq : flowult ] ) .",
    "integration of the rg equations yields : @xmath75 we have used @xmath76 as a constant that takes into account the variation of @xmath77 between @xmath59 and @xmath65 as it flows to zero .",
    "this does not change the @xmath5 dependence . collecting the intermediate results",
    ", we can give an asymptotic dependence of the total charge gap on @xmath5 : @xmath78 while deriving this result we have neglected terms generated to second order by @xmath5 , such as @xmath56,@xmath58 and @xmath57 . in the appendix [ ap : alternative ] we show that including those terms do not affect the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath5 .",
    "another interesting limit is when @xmath5 is comparable to @xmath4 .",
    "note that we always remain in the limit where @xmath81 in order to keep four points at the fermi level , otherwise the problem would be the trivial one of a single filled band of fermions . in that case",
    "the initial flow does not exist and we start directly with ( [ eq : flowlarge ] ) .",
    "the umklapp operator has an initial dimension of @xmath41 and thus initially decreases in the flow .",
    "however combined with the operator @xmath82 it generates from second order in the interaction expansion a term of the form @xmath83 .",
    "this new operator is relevant , its scaling dimension being @xmath84 .",
    "the flow equation of this operator reads : @xmath85 using the flow equations at large @xmath5 ( [ eq : flowlarge ] ) , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , these expressions are valid at the beginning of the flow and we have taken into account only the leading dependence on v. this leads to an approximate expression for @xmath88 , using the fact that for small interactions @xmath89 : @xmath90 the coupling @xmath88 starts at zero and is driven by @xmath25 which is decreasing rapidly .",
    "we may now determine the scale @xmath91 where @xmath88 becomes larger than @xmath25 . using ( [ eq : grho ] ) one gets : @xmath92 which yields @xmath93 .",
    "we note that at this scale @xmath38 has hardly changed at all , which validates the expression for @xmath88 .",
    "indeed @xmath38 reaches a value of order one at @xmath94 which for asymptotically small interactions is much larger than @xmath91 .",
    "the charge gap is dominated by @xmath88 and we may safely drop the original umklapp operator which gives only subdominant contributions .",
    "the gap in the total charge sector is given by the scale where @xmath88 reaches a value of order one .",
    "this gives a gap @xmath95 we note that the gap in the charge sector decreases faster than the gap in @xmath63sector , where @xmath96 .",
    "these asymptotic behaviors and the phase diagram are shown in figure  [ fig : phasediag ] .     phase diagram as a function of interaction and interchain hopping ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the ladder is an insulator for any repulsive interaction ( @xmath97 ) , while the single chain is insulating for @xmath98 .",
    "the dashes represent a cross - over between a region where @xmath5 is relevant in the rg sense and a region where it is irrelevant ( @xmath99 is the gap on a single chain ) . for @xmath100",
    "the charge gap , @xmath79 , vanishes as a power law of @xmath5 for small @xmath5 and as @xmath101 for small interaction ( see text).,width=340 ]    to go beyond the asymptotics either at small @xmath5 or at the transition @xmath80 , one needs to numerically integrate the flow ( [ eq : flow2chain],[eq : flowlarge],[eq : flowult ] ) .",
    "one example of such a flow is shown on figure  [ fig : rgflow1 ] .",
    "one clearly sees the initial decrease of the umklapp in the initial phases of the flow , followed by its subsequent increase when @xmath102 .",
    "the charge gap is given in figure  [ fig : chargegaptperp ] .",
    "the picture is quite different in this case since without interchain hopping a gap would be present on each chain . for small @xmath5 the model",
    "is conveniently studied in the chain basis , using the flow ( [ eq : flow2chain ] ) . because the field @xmath103 orders , the single particle hopping between the chains is irrelevant ( for small @xmath5 ) .",
    "the only remaining relevant coupling is thus the generated interchain density - density interaction @xmath56 .",
    "this coupling opens a gap in the antisymmetric sector and orders @xmath104 .",
    "the physics is quite clear : in the absence of interchain coupling each chain has a charge density wave ground state that is double degenerate . in the presence of @xmath5",
    ", particles still can not hop from chain to chain because of the mott gap in each chain , but the virtual hops tend to lock the two cdw relative to each other .",
    "this is shown on figure  [ fig : cdwlock ] .",
    "the mott gap is thus essentially here the single chain gap .",
    "the gap as a function of @xmath23 obtained by numerical integration of the flow is shown in figure  [ fig : fullgap ] .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : rg ] allow to draw the phase diagram of the commensurate ladder , as shown on figure  [ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "the very existence of an insulating phase in the ladder for @xmath50 prompts for several questions .",
    "apparently we have to face two very different behaviors depending on the strength of @xmath5 . for @xmath42 and small @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath5 renormalizes to zero as was shown in section  [ sec : confined ] , whereas for large @xmath5 ( or for @xmath50 where the single chain gap is absent ) @xmath5 renormalizes to large values .",
    "one thus seems to have a confinement - deconfinement transition , similar to the one expected for an infinite number of chains , induced by the competition between @xmath5 and the single chain mott gap @xmath105 .",
    "the change of behavior occurs when@xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the renormalized interchain hopping .",
    "we thus have to determine here whether we have two different insulating phases .",
    "this can be done by looking at the fields that order in each case . in the `` confined '' phase we showed in section  [ sec : confined ] that both @xmath108 and @xmath104 acquire mean values . in the `` deconfined '' phase , as was shown in section  [ sec : deconfined ] , @xmath109 and @xmath110 orders .",
    "the physical observable corresponding to an out of phase charge density wave takes the following form with the two different set of boson operators : @xmath111 it is easy to see from ( [ jztranslation ] ) that the conditions @xmath112 , @xmath113 on the one hand and @xmath114 , @xmath115 on the other both give a non zero value to @xmath116 .",
    "thus the two `` phases '' have the same ordered fields ( written in a different basis ) and there is no transition but a simple crossover . the out of phase charge density waves ground state that arises naturally from the @xmath42 picture and is shown in figure  [ fig : cdwlock ] stays valid even in the other limit .",
    "let us now determine the phase diagram of the ladder system away from half filling .",
    "introducing a chemical potential would change the hamiltonian into @xmath117 as we have seen that the operator opening the charge gap is always @xmath118 instead of @xmath119 for the single chain . using the known generic solution of such mott systems",
    "@xcite we can see that in the ladder the doping will destroy the mott phase when @xmath120 .",
    "the properties at the transition are the generic properties of the mott transition in one dimension when varying the doping ( mott-@xmath121 ) , namely : ( i ) a dynamical exponent @xmath122 ; ( ii ) a divergent compressibility on the metallic side .",
    "the luttinger liquid exponent is universal and is @xmath123 .",
    "this values is quite different from the one of a single chain .",
    "the differences are recalled in table  [ ta : luttinger ] .",
    ".[ta : luttinger ] luttinger liquid parameters at the mott transition , when varying the strength of the interaction ( mott - u ) and when varying the doping ( mott-@xmath121 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the difference in @xmath71 should be observable in numerical calculations such as exact diagonalization and dmrg",
    ". it might be a more clear signature of the difference between the ladder and the single chain that the gap itself specially for @xmath42 .",
    "these different values of @xmath71 correspond to two different kinds of elementary excitations .",
    "for the gapped single spinless chain the elementary excitations are domain walls separating charge density waves with a different phase , the equivalent of the excitations called spinons in the spin@xmath124 heisenberg model . in a path - integral picture",
    "these corresponds to configurations where the field @xmath8 is step - like with for instance @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "however such a configuration on one chain with a nearly constant configuration on the second chain has an infinite cost when there is a @xmath127 term in the model , no matter how small the coupling constant",
    ". therefore the low - energy excitations allowed for two coupled chains are kinks ( two domain walls confined in the same region ) .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the double - sine - gordon model that appears for a spontaneously dimerized frustrated spin@xmath124 chain ( next - nearest - neighbor exchange ) with an infinitesimal bond alternation perturbation @xcite .",
    "a summary of the phase diagram is shown on figure  [ fig : summary ] .",
    "we have investigated in this paper commensurate ladders of spinless fermions .",
    "we have shown that contrarily to the single chain , that needs a finite repulsion to become a mott insulator , a two leg ladder turns insulating for arbitrary small repulsion between the fermions .",
    "the interchain hopping thus paradoxically reinforces the insulating behavior of the system .",
    "we have computed the charge gap as a function of the luttinger exponent @xmath23 of a single chain . for values of @xmath23",
    "for which the single chain system would be metallic ( @xmath50 ) the charge gap vanishes as a power law of the interchain hopping @xmath5 for small @xmath5 , and faster than the standard bkt behavior , usually characterizing metal insulator transitions in one dimension , when the interactions tend to zero .",
    "the interchain hopping also affects the universal properties of the transition that occur upon doping the system .",
    "indeed for very small doping the luttinger liquid parameter takes the universal value @xmath128 instead of @xmath129 for a single chain ( when a mott gap is present ) .",
    "this difference in luttinger liquid parameters should be accessible in numerical simulations such as exact - diagonalization or dmrg .",
    "given the fact that when a mott gap is well established in a single chain the interchain hopping scales to zero , whereas it scales to large values otherwise , it was important to know whether there was a confinement - deconfinement transition .",
    "we have shown that there is in the spinless ladder only a crossover and that the two seemingly different insulating phases ( large mott gap on a single chain and small @xmath5 and large @xmath5 and small ( or zero ) single chain mott gap ) are in fact of the same nature .",
    "this leaves open how this cross - over should evolve for an increasing number of coupled chains to give back the confinement - deconfinement transition expected for an infinite number of chains .",
    "t.g . and p.d .",
    "would like to thank d. poilblanc and s. capponi for interesting discussions in the early stages of this work .",
    "one of the author ( y.s . ) is indebted to the financial support from universit paris  sud .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , science , sports and culture ( grant no.09640429 ) , japan .",
    "the rg equations ( [ eq : flow2chain ] ) show that during the first part of the flow up to @xmath59 , @xmath5 generates to second order the term @xmath130 .",
    "contracting @xmath56 with @xmath25 gives a contribution to the renormalization of the term @xmath131 ( noticing that @xmath132 , we switch to the notation @xmath88 instead of @xmath57 ) .",
    "this term is initially not present in the hamiltonian .",
    "however it is generated and relevant for any repulsive interaction .",
    "one must thus make sure that this term does not grow so fast as to open the gap before the original umklapp term . if it were the case this would change the expression for the charge gap compared to the one given in the text .    to determine the growth of this coupling",
    ", we have to determine @xmath133 .",
    "naively the scaling dimension of @xmath56 is @xmath134 , however it is generated by @xmath135 , term of dimension @xmath136 . comparing the two rates",
    "shows that the source term dominates .",
    "integration then shows that @xmath137 .",
    "we may now repeat the same analysis for @xmath88 , indeed its scaling dimension is @xmath134 but it is actually driven by @xmath138 , term of dimension @xmath139 , dominant in the regime considered here ( @xmath43 ) . consequently one has @xmath140 .",
    "thus at the scale @xmath59 , where @xmath5 is of order one , one has @xmath141 .    to complete the argument we note that the couplings @xmath142 and @xmath143 are above @xmath59 basically the same operator .",
    "indeed in the @xmath63sector @xmath38 has flowed to strong coupling above @xmath65 , @xmath144 .",
    "recalling that the flow between @xmath59 and @xmath65 does not change the asymptotic dependence on @xmath5 and that @xmath145 and @xmath146 are proportional we recover by following the flow of the coupling @xmath88 the behavior explained in the text ."
