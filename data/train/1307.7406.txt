    "<S> the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ( lbne ) is proposed to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and measure the cp phase @xmath0 in the leptonic sector . the current design of lbne phase i consists of a 10 kt liquid argon time projection chamber ( lbne10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry in the electron - neutrino appearance probability has contributions from both the cp phase and the matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , experimental sensitivity to the mass hierarchy depends both on the true value of the cp phase and the true mass hierarchy ; lbne10 will determine the mass hierarchy at high levels of significance for half of @xmath0 phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we propose placing a second detector at an off - axis location . </S>",
    "<S> such a detector will share the same beamline as the primary lbne detector . </S>",
    "<S> the detector location is chosen such that this detector focuses on a measurement of electron ( anti-)neutrino appearance at the second oscillation maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this configuration will enhance the ability of lbne to determine the mass hierarchy and to discover cp violation in the leptonic sector .    the recent discovery of sizable @xmath1 with reactor electron anti - neutrino disappearance measurements  @xcite and electron ( anti-)neutrino appearance measurements  @xcite opens door to the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy ( mh ) and the cp phase @xmath0 in the leptonic sector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino mass hierarchy problem is to determine whether the third generation of neutrino is heavier ( normal hierarchy / nh ) or lighter ( inverted hierarchy / ih ) than the first two generations of neutrinos . together with the next generation </S>",
    "<S> neutrinoless double beta decay experiments , the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy may hold the key to the nature of neutrinos ( dirac or majorana particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> a value of the cp phase not equal to zero or @xmath2 may produce the cp - violation that is required for leptogenesis  @xcite , which is a potential explanation for the apparent matter - anti - matter asymmetry in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of mh and the cp phase @xmath0 will have profound significance not only within the neutrino physics , but in the larger field of high - energy physics .     </S>",

    "<S> width=604 ]    the long - baseline neutrino experiment ( lbne )  @xcite is designed to determine the mh and @xmath0 simultaneously . by placing an on - axis detector at a baseline of 1300 km </S>",
    "<S> , lbne will measure the ( anti-)@xmath5 to ( anti-)@xmath3 oscillation . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : osc ] , the @xmath5 to @xmath3 oscillation probabilities are sensitive to both the mh ( through the matter effect ) and the value of @xmath0 . commonly , the peaks around 2.5 gev and 0.8 gev are referred to as the first and the second oscillation maximum , respectively . for the first oscillation maximum , </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino appearance probability is higher in the case of the normal hierarchy than in the case of the inverted hierarchy , regardless of the value of @xmath0 . with a wide - band ( large energy coverage ) </S>",
    "<S> beam , the lbne on - axis detector will cover both the first and the second oscillation maximum ( shown in fig .  [ fig : lbne ] ) with the emphasis on the first oscillation maximum .     </S>",
    "<S> appearance probability for two cases : i ) normal hierarchy with @xmath6 and ii ) inverted hierarchy with @xmath7 are shown . while the cancellation happens at the first oscillation maximum , the matter effect and the effect of @xmath0 will result in a distinctive feature at the second maximum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at second oscillation maximum , the off - axis beam provides a much higher flux than the on - axis beam . , width=453 ]    due to the potential cancellation between the matter effect and the effect of @xmath0 at the first oscillation maximum , the discovery potential of the mh strongly depends on the true value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mary ] , at the first oscillation maximum , the asymmetry in the neutrino - antineutrino appearance probability for @xmath8 with the normal hierarchy is close to that for @xmath9 with the inverted hierarchy . on the other hand , for the second oscillation maximum </S>",
    "<S> , the size of the cp asymmetry is larger and the size of the matter effect is smaller , so the degeneracy between the two solutions is broken . therefore , coverage of the second oscillation maximum is important for lbne and an improved measurement of electron ( anti-)neutrino appearance at the second oscillation maximum will enhance sensitivities to the mh and cp violation .     and anti-@xmath10 appearance at first and second oscillation maxima for both the normal and the inverted mass hierarchy . </S>",

    "<S> a 10 kt liquid argon time projection chamber is assumed to be the on - axis detector . </S>",
    "<S> a 10 kt water cerenkov detector is assumed to be the off - axis detector . </S>",
    "<S> the signal - to - noise ratio at the first ( second ) oscillation is excellent for the on - axis ( off - axis ) detector . </S>",
    "<S> , width=604 ]    in this whitepaper , _ we propose a second detector , a 10 kt water cerenkov detector , at an off - axis location dedicated to the second oscillation maximum to enhance the mh discovery potential and the overall performance of the lbne program . _    due to the two - body kinematics of the pion decay , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite at 27 mrad off - axis . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the off - axis neutrino beam approximately matches the location of the second oscillation maximum . </S>",
    "<S> comparing to the on - axis neutrino beam , the off - axis beam flux is much higher at the second oscillation maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow - band beam also provides advantages in reducing backgrounds , which are generated by high - energy neutrinos , but misidentified as being low - energy neutrinos due to imperfect reconstructions . </S>",
    "<S> these include neutral - current background and @xmath13-neutrino ( oscillated from the @xmath14-neutrino ) appearance background . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : sob ] shows the expected signal - to - background ratio for the ( anti-)@xmath5 running ( nh and @xmath0=0 ) with a 10 kt off - axis water cerenkov ( wc ) detector in which the performance is assumed to be the same as super - kamiokande ( sk2 performance  @xcite assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expected signal - to - background ratios for the 10 kt lbne on - axis liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar tpc ) are also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sob ] for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the signal - to - background ratio is excellent at the first oscillation maximum for the on - axis lar tpc detector , while the off - axis wc detector provides a cleaner signal at the second oscillation maximum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that such a detector can work on surface to reduce cost with sufficient shielding .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics sensitivities to the determination of the mass hierarchy and the discovery of cp violation with the additional 10-kt , off - axis water cerenkov detector , are calculated in globes  @xcite using the 2010 lbne beam design ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the input oscillation parameters to generate expected spectra are taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical interpretation of mh sensitivity is explained in detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the off - axis detector will considerably improve the combined sensitivity of lbne10 and t2k  @xcite in mh , with slight improvement in sensitivity to the cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> at the worst possible @xmath0 values , the increment in the mh sensitivity ( @xmath15 ) with the second 10 kt off - axis wc detector is equivalent to that of an additional 10 kt on - axis lar tpc . since the wc detector is much cheaper than the lar tpc with the same target mass , adding the second off - axis wc detector is a more efficient way to enhance mh sensitivity at the bad half of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the mh sensitivity can be further enhanced with a narrower off - axis neutrino beam  @xcite without increasing the total flux intensity or a larger target mass  .    , is not zero or @xmath2 ( left ) and to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy ( right ) are shown . </S>",
    "<S> three cases are compared : i ) lbne10 with only the on - axis 10 kt lar tpc , ii ) combining the results of lbne10 with those from the t2k experiment , and iii ) combining the results of lbne10 with t2k and a 10-kt water cerenkov detector at a location 27-mrad off - axis from the lbne beam line . </S>",
    "<S> the mass hierarchy sensitivity in the bad half of @xmath0 is significantly improved with the second off - axis detector . </S>",
    "<S> , width=604 ]    in summary , a second detector at an off - axis location focusing on the second oscillation maximum can enhance the ability of lbne10 to determine the mass hierarchy and strengthen its potential to discover cp violation in the leptonic sector . </S>"
