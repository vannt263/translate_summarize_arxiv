    "the quantum correlation for a quantum state contains entanglement and the other type of nonclassical correlations@xcite .",
    "thus , quantum correlations become the subject of intense studies in the last two decades @xcite . among the various researches ,",
    "it is of great significance to measure the quantum correlations quantitatively .",
    "there are much attention put on the quantification of bipartite quantum correlations , including quantum discord @xcite , geometric discord @xcite , quantum deficit @xcite , measurement - induced disturbance @xcite , etc , and each of these measures are useful in particular physical contexts .",
    "recently , lqu for bipartite quantum systems , as an another measure for quantum correlations , has been proposed by girolami @xcite .",
    "the lqu quantifies the uncertainty in a quantum state due to measurement of a local observable .",
    "nevertheless , such quantifier has strong reasons to be considered as a faithful measure of quantumness in quantum states .",
    "but due to inherent optimization , finding closed formula is a difficult problem for most of the correlations measures .",
    "for instance , there is no analytical formulae of quantum discord even for two - qubit quantum systems and in bipartite systems with higher dimension , the results are known for only some certain states @xcite .",
    "it is possible to derive closed formula geometric discord and also for quantum discord for werner and isotropic classes of states due to their highly inherent symmetry in the structures .",
    "however , lqu has derived for a large class of arbitrary - dimensional bipartite quantum states @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been studied that mixed states being invariant under certain joint symmetry operations of the bipartite system .",
    "we consider a slightly more general class of states , rotationally symmetric states , also known as the @xmath0-invariant states .",
    "these states are invariant under the global rotations of both subsystems and their density matrices arise from thermal equilibrium states of low - dimensional spin systems with a rotationally invariant hamiltonian by tracing out all degrees of freedom except those two spins .",
    "@xmath0-invariant density matrices of two spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 are defined to be invariant under @xmath5 , and we have @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the usual rotation operator representation of @xmath0 with real parameter @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for @xmath0 invariant",
    "quantum spin systems , negativity is shown to be necessary and sufficient for separability @xcite , and the relative entropy of entanglement has been analytically calculated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement of formation ( eof ) , i - concurrence , i - tangle and convex - roof - extended negativity of the @xmath0-invariant states of a spin-@xmath11 and spin-1/2 @xcite have been analytically calculated by using the approach in @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum discord for @xmath0-invariant states composed of spin-@xmath11 and spin-1/2 systems has been analytically calculated in @xcite .",
    "also , the one - way deficit has been calculated for @xmath0-invariant states and show that the one - way deficit is equal to the quantum discord for half - integer @xmath11 , and is larger than the quantum discord for integer @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "abundance of @xmath0 invariant states in real physical systems , make them a good candidate for utilization in quantum computing protocols .    in the present work the behavior of lqu of @xmath0-invariant states",
    "is studied and the paper consist of the following sections : in section ii we review the definition of lqu for bipartite systems and in section iii we show the definition of @xmath0 invariant states . finally , in section iv we have calculated the lqu of a spin-1/2 particle and arbitrary spin-@xmath11 particle or of a spin-1 particle and a spin-@xmath11 particle with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the paper is ended with a brief conclusion .",
    "classically , it is possible to measure any two observables with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "however , such measurement is not always possible in quantum systems .",
    "uncertainty relation gives the statistical nature of errors in these kinds of measurement .",
    "measurement of single observable can also help to detect uncertainty of a quantum observable . for a quantum state @xmath12 , an observable",
    "is called quantum certain , if the error in measurement of the observable is due to only the ignorance about the classical mixing in @xmath12 .",
    "a good quantifier of this uncertainty to an observable is the skew information , defined by wigner and yanase @xcite as @xmath13^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a bipartite quantum state @xmath14 , girolami et.al .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of local quantum uncertainty ( lqu ) defined as @xmath15 the minimization is performed over all local maximally informative observable ( or non - degenerate ) @xmath16 .",
    "this quantity quantifies the minimum amount of uncertainty in a quantum state .",
    "the closed form of the lqu for @xmath17 quantum systems as introduced by girolami @xcite is @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the maximum eigenvalue of the @xmath20 matrix w with the elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the pauli matrices .",
    "considering two particles , one with spin @xmath24 and the other @xmath25 , and the states that are symmetric under global rotations .",
    "the symmetry group is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and j is the angular - momentum vector .",
    "the twirling operator can be shown @xmath28 where , @xmath29 is the group - invariant measure for the rotation group .",
    "the states that are invariant under the twirling operation are those that are convex combinations of the states associated with the projectors onto the irreducible subspaces of total angular momentum .",
    "these projectors are @xmath30 thus the @xmath31-invariant states are @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "an su(2)-invariant state @xmath12 of a bipartite system that composed of a spin-@xmath11 and a spin-1/2 subsystems are parameterized by a single parameter which will be denoted by @xmath35 throughout this paper and can be written in total spin basis as @xcite    @xmath36    the eigenstates of total angular momentum are well known , given by the clebsch - gordon coefficients and can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . by substitution the clebsch - gordon coefficients in eq.4 ,",
    "we can write the density matrix in product basis as    @xmath40    where @xmath41    it is straightforward to calculate the @xmath42 and to evaluate the lqu of @xmath43 , let @xmath44 denote a local observable , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath22 , @xmath47=(1 , 2 , 3 ) represent the pauli matrices , which are the generators of @xmath0 . since making the measurements on spin-@xmath11 subsystem will make the minimization procedure even harder , thus local observables are made on the spin-1/2 subsystem or @xmath48 subsystems .",
    "after calculations , we find that lqu do not depend on the measurement parameters , therefore , our calculation do not require any minimization over the projective measurements .",
    "then for integer and half - integer @xmath11 , we have    @xmath49    fig.1 and fig.2 shows the lqu of spin-@xmath11 and spin-1/2 system for some half - integer and integer @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that as @xmath35=@xmath11/(2@xmath11 + 1 ) the lqu is exactly zero and as we can see , for high dimensional systems ( large j ) , the lqu becomes symmetric around the point @xmath35=1/2 where lqu vanishes . also , as we can see in fig.1 , when @xmath11=1/2 , the state becomes the @xmath50 werner state , and the lqu is equal to 1 at @xmath35=1 .",
    "an su(2)-invariant state @xmath12 of a bipartite system that is composed of a spin-@xmath11 and a spin-1 subsystems are parameterized by parameters denoted by @xmath35 and @xmath51 is @xcite    @xmath52    the eigenstates of total angular momentum are well known , given by the clebsch - gordon coefficients and can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 by using the clebsch - gordon coefficients , density matrix in product basis can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 now , let @xmath44 denote a local observable , with @xmath57 and @xmath46 , where @xmath58 , with @xmath47=(1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8) represent the generators of @xmath59 . since the lqu definition requires a minimization over the local observable , then we need to optimize the lqu value over the local observable .",
    "the procedure of our approach is straightforward , we used the method of lagrange multipliers finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraint .",
    "firstly , we find the optimum value of the lqu is achieved when @xmath60 .",
    "this shows that if the local measurements are performed by them , then the related lqu are obtained as : @xmath61 .",
    "the other optimum value of lqu is achieved when @xmath62 , yielding the lqu as : @xmath63 .",
    "now , we have ; @xmath64 in fig.3 , fig.4 and fig.5 we show the lqu of spin-@xmath11 and spin-1 system that is a function of @xmath35 and @xmath51 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "recently , some measures such as the entanglement of formation ( eof ) , i - concurrence , i - tangle , convex - roof - extended negativity and quantum discord of the @xmath0-invariant states of a spin-@xmath11 and spin-1/2 particles have been analytically calculated . in this paper",
    "we have studied a wider range of @xmath0 invariant states that consisting of a spin-@xmath11 and a spin-1/2 subsystems and also a spin-@xmath11 and a spin-1 subsystems by the lqu and we have derived analytical expression for them .",
    "however , we suggest that the lqu for other states ( or states being invariant under other transformation groups ) can be studied in the future investigation ."
