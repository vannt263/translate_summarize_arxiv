    "a wealth of observations over the past decade have collectively converged on the @xmath1cdm  concordance \" cosmology , including results from high-@xmath2 supernovae @xcite , the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , sdss @xcite , wmap @xcite , and weak lensing @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even given the precision of these measurements and the agreement between such a wide variety of independent observations , the formation of structure on galaxy - size scales remains a challenge for cosmological models . in particular , the formation and evolution of the first massive galaxies is still poorly understood .",
    "this is distressing given that more than half of all luminous matter in the local universe is contained within massive elliptical galaxies built up at earlier times @xcite .",
    "simple semi - analytic models ( sams ) based on the standard cosmological paradigm predict that massive galaxies form rather late in the history of the universe ( @xmath3 ) from successive mergers of smaller galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models , however , have traditionally suffered from an overprediction of the number density of both low and high luminosity galaxies , as well as an inverted color - magnitude relation ( i.e. , luminous blue galaxies ) , and an inability to reproduce the observed color bi - modality in galaxy distributions .",
    "feedback from sources such as star formation and agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) seems necessary in order to reconcile these models with observations .",
    "results from the latest sams predict that , while the _ stars _ in massive elliptical galaxies formed quickly and early on , their _ assembly _ into the most massive galaxies is characterized by a late , hierarchical build - up @xcite .",
    "the predictions of hierarchical assembly can be explored through high resolution morphological studies of massive galaxies comprising old stellar populations at high redshift .",
    "examples of such galaxies have become increasingly abundant in the literature @xcite ; however morphological information has still been relatively sparse .",
    "it is commonly assumed that spheroids should dominate evolved galaxies at high redshift as they do in the local universe .",
    "however , some recent studies have found evidence for s0-type galaxies as well as exponential disks among these evolved galaxies at high @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we present a sample of seven @xmath0 `` old galaxies '' ( ogs , by which we refer to the age of the dominant stellar population and not necessarily the age given by the time elapsed since galaxy assembly ) selected to have both @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "we have obtained high - resolution morphological data for these objects from hst acs and nicmos imaging .",
    "we discuss the range in morphological classes among ogs in our sample at @xmath0 and the implications for galaxy formation scenarios . throughout this paper",

    "the nicmos images , however , required a more careful processing .",
    "we first checked to make sure the observations were taken long enough after saa passage ( @xmath12 min . ) so that they did not suffer from cosmic ray persistence .",

    "we therefore can not say whether a merger between these two sources is occurring , however , we note that the @xmath24-band flux ratios of the galaxies implies that any merger would be minor and would not significantly disrupt the structure of the primary galaxy .",
    "er2 , the second old galaxy found in the field of txs0145 + 386 , was unresolved from ground - based , non - ao imaging . from the hst imaging it is clear that er2 is in fact an interacting galaxy pair .",

    "modeling of the galaxy pair in er2 is a bit more uncertain than modeling a single galaxy due to the increased degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the compact galaxy in this pair is well modeled by a srsic profile with a high index ( @xmath25 ) and a small effective radius .",
    "we constrained our fit to the @xmath26 case , and only allowed galfit to model the second , more extended galaxy .",
    "this second galaxy is well represented by a profile that has a srsic index intermediate between a classical elliptical and a classical disk , although closer to a disk .",
    "the best - fit srsic index gives @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ t0145er2morph ] ) .",
    "the acs image for this galaxy shows a highly irregular structure , and can only be modeled with a relatively broad and flat profile , similar to that of a low surface brightness disk .",
    "j094258 + 4659 ero is visibly elongated in both the acs and nicmos images , and appears to be either an edge - on disk or s0 galaxy with a small central bulge .",
    "comparison of the nicmos and acs images shows that the stars in the bulge appear to be somewhat redder than stars in the disk , as expected for typical disk or s0 galaxies .",
    "it is likely that the bulge component formed first , with the disk completing its star formation only slightly later .",
    "the dominant stellar population , however , appears to be @xmath28 gyr old ( iye et al .",

    "@xcite noted from their subaru imaging that j094258 + 4659 ero appeared to be an s0-type galaxy with approximately 30% of the total light being contributed from a central bulge component .",
    "the nicmos imaging confirms this result and the best fit galfit model is an exponential disk with a 32% bulge component ( fig .",
    "[ j094258morph ] ) . the acs image , while noisier in the outer regions , also appears to favor a disk - dominated galaxy with 25% of the total light contributed by a central bulge .      inspection of the hst images for b2 1018 + 34 er2 reveals a striking grand design spiral arm structure .",
    "the arms are clearly bluer than the central region , especially a few noticeable knots of star formation in the acs image .",
    "some of these knots are also visible in the nicmos image , notably the knots that appear to be on the ends of a possible bar , or the innermost region of the spiral arms .",

    "if there was a major merging event in the past , it could not have produced much star formation since the age of the dominant stellar population , as shown by both broad - band photometry and medium - resolution spectra ( paper i ) , is extremely old ( @xmath30 gyr ) , with little evidence for any admixture from a younger , uv - dominated population .",
    "the acs profile is in agreement with the nicmos profile , also favoring a classical de  vaucouleurs elliptical galaxy .",

    "elliptical galaxies in the local universe exhibit color gradients , with the inner regions being redder than the outermost regions @xcite .",

    "these models predict that elliptical galaxies consist of several distinct stellar populations , with mergers driving gas and dust into the central regions promoting mixing and fueling star formation which in turn dilutes color gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ) , possibly even leading to inverted color gradients ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at high @xmath2",

    "we used the same psfs that were generated for the morphological modeling with the exception that the psfs were resampled to the proper pixel scale before convolution .",

    "we then rotated the images using header keywords that defined the telescope roll angle for each observation , and shifted them using the galaxy centroids as a primary alignment . when possible , other stars in the field were used to double check the rotation and offsets in order to ensure that differences in galaxy centroids between the blue and red components did not affect the alignment .",

    "these color maps are shown in figure [ color_fig ] .",
    "the two galaxies that clearly follow r@xmath21-law profiles , txs 0145 + 386 er1 and txs 1211 + 334 er1 , have relatively flat colors , consistent with little or no color gradients . these galaxies are uniformly red at least to @xmath40 , where the s / n becomes too low to precisely determine any further color variation .",
    "there is no evidence for any inverted color gradient , such as that seen in roughly 50% of the hubble deep field galaxies @xcite , which implies that these galaxies most likely have not suffered any recent star forming events .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by the individual acs and nicmos images , which show extremely relaxed systems with similar morphologies both short - ward and long - ward of the 4000 - break .",
    "however , the flatness of the color gradients in these two elliptical galaxies is quite different from what we observe in massive ellipticals in the local universe .",
    "it is possible that some amount of dry merging has already occurred in these galaxies , diluting any initial metallicity gradients present from formation .",
    "it is interesting to note that a `` companion '' galaxy to the east of txs 0145 + 386 er1 has the same color as that of er1 .",
    "this companion could be indicative of a possible future minor merger event .",

    "the bulge is clearly red , and its stars are most likely slightly older than those in the disk .",
    "if we take the color difference between the nw and se sides of the disk and assume the difference arises solely from reddening effects , the extinction we infer based on the standard galactic extinction curve ( @xmath42 ) is consistent with the globally averaged extinction derived from the sed fitting @xcite .",

    "the observed color gradient in this galaxy , however , is reminiscent of that found in local giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "this gradient is almost certainly due to a metallicity gradient , rather than an age gradient , given the fact that something very close to a single instantaneous burst of star formation appears to be required in order to fit the photometry .",
    "there is little evidence from either the photometry or the spectroscopic data for any recent star formation occurring in this galaxy .",
    "all signs indicate that this is an extremely relaxed , massive disk of old stars that must somehow evolve into something resembling a massive elliptical galaxy by the present day .",
    "morphological classes for eros at high @xmath2 have largely been assumed to be correlated with their spectral type .",
    "that is , dusty starbursts are generally assumed to be disk - dominated , while galaxies with evolved stellar populations are assumed to be bulge - dominated .",
    "we have found three cases , however , or roughly half of our sample , that exhibit exponential ( or nearly exponential ) profiles and are dominated by extremely old stars , plus a fourth galaxy with an exponential profile and somewhat younger stars .",
    "@xcite find a similar result for their sample of eros at @xmath43 , with a little over half ( 7/12 ) of their absorption - line - only systems being disk - dominated ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , even among their galaxies that show small amounts of [ ] emission , they note that the underlying stellar populations often appear to be quite old . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite find that nearly all of their spectroscopically quiescent systems in the gemini deep deep survey are bulges , and on the basis of this conclude that morphology is a reasonable indicator of spectral activity .",
    "their approach to morphological classification , however , is quite different from that of @xcite or from our own approach .",
    "they use a technique based on an asymmetry index and a gini index , which can be thought of as a generalized concentration index @xcite .",
    "the requirement for a galaxy to be classified as bulge - dominated under this system is a low asymmetry ( @xmath44 ) and a high gini index ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this assumes that disk galaxies will be more asymmetric due to spiral arms and knots of star formation , and less centrally concentrated than their elliptical counterparts .",
    "however , a disk of old stars can be quite symmetric , so there is reason to be cautious when using this classification system .",
    "furthermore , it is well known , as @xcite  point out , that the asymmetry - gini ( ag ) classification can not distinguish between e and s0 galaxies",
    ".    in fact , we have found that the inability of the ag method to distinguish between morphological classes appears to extend to galaxies of all types that are dominated by old stars .",
    "j094258 + 46592 ero , 4c15.55 er2 , and txs1812 + 412 er2 , which appear to be dominated by disks of old stars from our nicmos surface brightness profile fitting , all have asymmetry indices near 0.05 and gini indices near 0.50 ( two of them having a gini index slightly greater than 0.50 and one being slightly less than 0.50 ) , as determined by the morpheusabraham / morpheus/ ] code @xcite .",
    "these values would place them into the @xcite  `` early type '' category , which is clearly a misclassification in terms of morphology .",
    "we therefore have based our morphologies on radial surface brightness profiles , since this method does not assume anything about the distribution of starlight in the galaxies we are measuring , and appears to give the most robust results , especially when dealing with evolved stellar populations .",
    "for the four galaxies in our sample that were determined to have strong exponential components to their radial light profiles , we examined their sizes and compare them to those of present - day disk galaxies .",
    "j094258 + 4659 ero and b2 1018 + 34 er2 have effective radii of 7.3 and 6.0 kpc , respectively , which correspond to disk scale lengths of 4.4 and 3.6 kpc .",
    "this is roughly consistent with average disks in the local universe @xcite which have scale lengths of 5.5@xmath462.7 kpc , and is comparable to the massive disks found by @xcite at @xmath47",
    ". these galaxies could well be the passively evolved descendants of such a population .",
    "the effective radius for 4c 15.55 er2 , on the other hand , is only 3.2 kpc , corresponding to a scale length of 1.9 kpc , and the effective radius of txs1812 + 412 er2 is 3.6 kpc , corresponding to a scale length of 2.1 kpc .",
    "while the number statistics are low , taken together there is a general trend that these old disk galaxies at @xmath481.5 are 45% smaller than present - day disks .",
    "this is in line with recent work on the size evolution predicted by cdm dark matter halo growth @xcite .",
    "while their size may be well explained under standard cdm predictions , the three oldest disk galaxies , j094258 + 46592 , 4c15.55 er2 , and txs1812 + 412 er2 , pose an interesting problem for hierarchical formation scenarios nonetheless .",
    "4c15.55 er2 , in particular , is difficult to explain since it appears to be a nearly pure disk of 2@xmath49 that completed star formation by @xmath50 .",
    "any mergers that may have occurred between @xmath51 would have to have been minor mergers of gas poor systems in order to preserve both the disk structure and the age of the stellar population .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that mergers could be the dominant formation mechanism for such a galaxy .",
    "instead , something more similar to monolithic collapse , where star - formation proceeds rapidly and efficiently in a single burst spread more - or - less evenly across the disk , seems much more reasonable .",
    "the selection of our sources near radio - loud quasars likely places them in more overdense regions that will eventually form present - day clusters . as such",
    ", they are unlikely to be representative of all quiescent galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "however , the galaxies were chosen purely by photometric criteria , and there is no reason to believe that disks would be preferentially selected . an equivalent selection in the local universe would result almost exclusively in elliptical and s0 ( i.e. , bulge - dominated ) galaxies . therefore , while not necessarily representative of all quiescent galaxies at high redshift , it is clear that at least some massive galaxies are unlikely to have assembled the bulk of their stars through mergers .      a number of recent studies have found evidence for highly compact , massive galaxies at @xmath52 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the majority of our sources are not especially compact when compared with local galaxies of similar mass .",
    "the typical effective radius of a @xmath53 galaxy in the sdss is 6 kpc at rest - frame i - band @xcite .",
    "the galaxies presented here are typically @xmath146 kpc at rest - frame r - band .",
    "three galaxies ( txs1211 + 334 er1 , 4c15.55 er2 , and txs1812 + 412 er2 ) are more compact than this by a factor of @xmath142 . note , however , that we use the @xcite imf which results in mass estimates that are a factor of 1.5 times smaller than masses calculated using the @xcite imf as in the sdss @xcite .",
    "if we apply this correction factor to our mass estimates , then the typical size for galaxies of similar mass in the sdss would be 7.0 kpc , and our galaxies would generally be 15 % smaller than this , with three more than 50% smaller than this . there is a slight tendency toward smaller effective radii at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , our rest - frame @xmath54-band vs. rest - frame @xmath55-band data ) , which could increase the discrepancy further if we had morphological information at rest - frame @xmath56-band to compare with the sdss .",
    "however , in most cases size appears to be roughly independent of observed wavelength , as evidenced by the approximately flat color gradients seen in many of these galaxies .",
    "none of our galaxies are as compact as the @xmath57kpc galaxies found at @xmath47 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our three smallest galaxies are consistent with galaxies at @xmath58 in the @xcite sample , while the rest are significantly larger .",
    "it is interesting to note that the galaxies with the lowest dust content ( @xmath59 ) from the photometric sed fitting ( with the exception of txs0145 + 386 er2 , which appears to be undergoing a dry merger ) , also appear to be the most compact , regardless of the disk or bulge - like nature of their morphology .",
    "this may be a further manifestation of the relationship between star - formation and size at @xmath60 found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of our galaxies are best fit by single , instantaneous bursts of star formation at high redshift rather than constant star formation models and would therefore all fall under the `` quiescent '' category of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the evidence for dust in galaxies with larger effective radii ( and likewise , the lack of dust in the most compact sources ) may point to a relationship between star - formation _ history _ and size . in this",
    "scenario galaxies that form rapidly and undergo intense , highly efficient star formation early - on end up as compact objects , either disks or bulges , while galaxies where star formation is slightly less efficient may leave behind more dust and may form more gradually , leading to extended morphologies . while the number statistics are low , this idea would appear to be supported by the fact that galaxies with similarly aged stellar populations at higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) tend to have even more compact morphologies .",
    "these @xmath47 galaxies must have formed over even shorter time periods than the galaxies in the present @xmath0 sample .",
    "regardless of how these galaxies formed originally , it is clear that given the age of the universe , over the remaining @xmath1412 billion years from the end of star formation until the present day , it is likely that they will undergo a number of subsequent mergers .",
    "this is even more evident for the disks of old stars that we see at @xmath0 , since we do not find any comparable galaxies in the local universe .",
    "some mechanism must be responsible for converting them into objects that more closely resemble either s0 or giant elliptical galaxies in the present - day .",
    "furthermore , the lack of luminous blue galaxies in the local universe requires that this mechanism must not destroy or dilute the old stellar populations present in these galaxies .",
    "there has been much discussion recently about ",
    "dry mergers \" , in which little or no cold gas is available to form new stars , as an important mechanism for preserving old stellar populations and generating the massive spheroids we see in the local universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the rest - frame b - band luminosity density of red galaxies evolves only mildly between @xmath61 .",
    "this requires at least a factor of two increase by @xmath62 in the stellar mass density present on the red sequence in order to compensate for dimming due to continued passive evolution of the stellar populations .",
    "@xcite attribute this evolution to both gas poor mergers and to truncation of star formation in blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite also studied the dry merger fraction among galaxies in the gems survey and found that luminous early - type galaxies on the red sequence will undergo on average @xmath141 major dry merger between @xmath63 and the present day .",
    "@xcite finds a similar result , with @xmath1470% of bulge - dominated galaxies experiencing a dry merger with a median mass ratio @xmath64 in the recent past ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "he derives a current mass accretion rate of roughly 10% gyr@xmath7 , which again implies about a factor of 2 increase in stellar mass density in luminous red galaxies between @xmath66 .",
    "txs 0145 + 386 er2 may be an example of this dry merging process in action .",
    "the colors of the galaxies in this merging pair are consistent with that of old stellar populations rather than dusty starbursts ( paper i ) , and there is no evidence for any significant amount of recent star formation . recall that the compact , northwest galaxy in this pair was best fit by a very small effective radius , while the second , more extended galaxy to the southeast appeared to be best fit by something similar to an exponential disk , especially at rest - frame u - band .",
    "in addition , the color map for this galaxy showed evidence for some possibly younger ( although still relatively old ) stars fanning out from the compact nw galaxy , which may imply that this spheroid is the central bulge of a disk galaxy being torn apart by the interaction .",
    "if these scenarios are correct , this could imply a dry merger between two old disk galaxies , which would provide the much needed link between these oddities at @xmath10 and present - day massive ellipticals .",
    "another of our galaxies , txs1211 + 334 er1 , was best fit by an r@xmath21-law , but residuals along the axis of elongation suggest a more complex formation history .",
    "it is possible that this galaxy suffered a merger in its recent past .",
    "however , given that no signatures of star formation are visible in the rest - frame uv spectrum of the source and that the sed favors a stellar population that is at least 1.4 gyr old ( paper i ) with a current star formation rate of @xmath67 m@xmath17 yr@xmath7 ( table [ tab - comp ] ) , any merging event must have been gas poor . taken together , txs0145 + 386 er2 and txs1211 + 334 er1 may represent different stages of a similar process .",
    "we have studied a sample of seven evolved galaxies at @xmath0 with high resolution imaging from hst . these are summarized below .    1 .   _",
    "txs0145 + 386 er1 _ is a relaxed elliptical galaxy at @xmath68 with a dominant stellar population that is @xmath141 gyr old ( paper i ) .",
    "there is no evidence for any color gradient across the galaxy , implying the stars are uniformly old , yet may have been mixed through dry merging events in the past .",
    "a `` companion '' galaxy 2@xmath69 to the east has the same color as er1 and may indicate a current or future minor merging event .",
    "there are no visible signs of interaction between these two galaxies , but these features may be too faint to observe at this redshift , especially if they are dominated by old stars .",
    "txs0145 + 386 er2 _ is a pair of merging galaxies at @xmath70 .",
    "one galaxy is extremely compact , while the other is much more extended and redder in color .",
    "their combined flux gives an sed of an extremely old stellar population ( 2.5 gyr ) with no dust ( paper i ) .",
    "this result implies that no recent star formation is occurring and that they are undergoing a dry merger . the acs image of this pair shows some irregular structure in the extended galaxy which",
    ", if due to small amounts of star formation and/ or dust , implies even older ages for the majority of the stars in order to produce an average age of 2.5 gyr .",
    "there is some evidence from the color map , as well as a visible elongation in the acs image , for bluer stars in a tail outward from the compact galaxy to the northwest ; however the s / n is low in this outermost region .",
    "j094258 + 4659.2 ero _ is a disk - dominated galaxy at @xmath71 with a bulge that contributes roughly 30% of the total light .",
    "the dominant stellar population is on average 1 gyr old @xcite .",
    "a color gradient is present , with the central bulge being redder than the disk , and the disk is noticeably bluer on the northwest side and redder on the southeast side .",
    "this is most likely due to slightly different stellar populations in the bulge and disk , as well as dust obscuration along the southeast side of the disk .",
    "b21018 + 34 er2 _ is a grand design spiral galaxy at @xmath72 with a stellar population that is on average 0.64 gyr old ( paper i ) , although it is likely that the majority of the stars are much older ( @xmath73 gyr , table [ tab - comp ] ) with a small contribution by mass from younger stars .",
    "spiral arms are most clearly visible in the acs image , while the nicmos image has a smoother profile .",
    "a color map of the galaxy shows that a dust lane runs from the southeast to the northwest in front of the bulge .",
    "txs1211 + 334 er1 _ appears to be a classic elliptical galaxy at @xmath74 with an age of 1.4 gyr ( paper i ) .",
    "residuals from subtracting an r@xmath21-law profile from the nicmos image indicate that the galaxy may have suffered a merging event in the past and may still be in the process of relaxing .",
    "there is no evidence for any significant color gradient across the galaxy , which may be due to population mixing from prior merging events .",
    "4c15.55 er2 _ is essentially a pure disk of old ( 1.8 gyr , paper i ) stars at @xmath75 .",
    "a moderate color gradient is visible in this galaxy , with the central regions slightly redder than the outermost regions , which could indicate a metallicity gradient .",
    "it is important to note that there does not appear to be a significant bulge component to this galaxy ( @xmath76% of the total light ) , so this color gradient can not be explained by a difference in stellar populations between a bulge and disk component .",
    "txs1812 + 412 er2 _ appears to be another disk - dominated galaxy at @xmath77 with an age of 1.4 gyr ( paper i ) .",
    "the best - fit profile for this source requires a @xmath78% contribution from a compact core .",
    "there is a mild color gradient visible for this source , with the central regions being slightly redder than the outer regions .    from the morphologies of these galaxies",
    "it is clear that age , or spectroscopic activity is not necessarily a surrogate for morphological class , and vice versa .",
    "three of these galaxies ( j094258 + 4659.2 , 4c15.55 er2 , and txs1812 + 412 er2 ) have strong exponential components to their radial light distributions , and both their broad - band seds and rest - frame uv continua point to evolved stellar populations ( @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "the existence of massive evolved disks at high redshift is a challenge for current semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , since it implies that they have not undergone a single major merging event since their formation more than 1 gyr earlier .",
    "instead , they appear to have formed by a mechanism more similar to monolithic collapse . furthermore , their existence is problematic for new theories that rely on agn feedback in galaxy formation in order to reproduce the observed large scale properties of galaxies , since powerful agns are likely triggered by major mergers and preferentially exist in luminous spheroids .",
    "it would seem that another mechanism must be responsible either for triggering the agn feedback or for terminating star formation in these disk galaxies at early times , possibly by the rapid formation and efficient processing of all available gas into stars in a single burst of activity .",
    "dry mergers may be the important link between these old galaxies and present - day massive ellipticals .",
    "we have found at least one example of this process in action .",
    "dry mergers appear to be an important evolutionary phase in most luminous red galaxies at @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "however , massive disks of old stars that have not suffered a single major merger are present at early times , implying that multiple formation mechanisms may be required to explain how the earliest massive galaxies formed",
