    "heiles ( 1984 ) has identified atomic hydrogen ( hi ) gas filaments `` crawling '' away from the plane of the inner galaxy .",
    "these so - called `` worms '' were proposed to be parts of larger hi shells blown by the energetic stellar winds or supernovae in stellar associations .",
    "such open , or blown out , shells would serve as conduits for hot gas and radiation to escape into the galactic halo , as recently observed in the superbubble / chimney reported by normandeau et  al .",
    "koo et al . (",
    "1992 ) later produced a catalogue of 118 galactic worm candidates , defining as a worm any dusty , h  i structure perpendicular to the galactic plane .    the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) is currently mapping a 70 degree longitude segment of the northern galaxy at high resolution in hi ( taylor et al . 1999 ) .",
    "one galactic worm candidate , gw 123.4 - 1.5 , is within the early regions surveyed .",
    "these observations reveal that gw 123 - 1.5 is an unusual , mushroom - shaped cloud , hundreds of pc in size , apparently unrelated to a conventional shell or chimney structure . in this paper",
    "we present the observations , derive the observed properties of the mushroom cloud , and discuss possible scenarios for its origin .",
    "the hi emission from gw 123.4 - 1.5 was observed using the synthesis telescope of the dominion radio astrophysical observatory .",
    "a complete synthesis of the field of view ( 2.5@xmath3 at @xmath421 cm ) was combined with short spacing information from the drao 26-m telescope ( higgs 1999 ) so that there are no gaps in the uv plane and all spatial scales are detected to a limiting resolution of @xmath5 ( ra @xmath6 dec ) .",
    "data cubes obtained for each of 10 fields were mosaiced together .",
    "five northern fields within the mosaic , observed between 1995 and 1997 , are part of the on - going cgps and five southern fields were observed in june 1997 and july 1998 with identical parameters by extending the cgps grid to more negative galactic latitude .    the complex gain calibration was applied from observations of strong unresolved sources before and after each 12-hour synthesis .",
    "the s7 region , with an adopted brightness temperature of 100 k , was used as the flux calibrator for the 26-m observations .",
    "each cube contained 256 velocity channels with a channel spacing of 0.824 km  s@xmath7 and an lsr velocity range of @xmath8 to 58 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "each field was then corrected for primary beam attenuation , resulting in a non - uniform noise distribution in the mosaiced images .",
    "the mosaic s r.m.s .",
    "noise per channel ranges from a minimum of 2.9  k ( at the field center locations ) to 4.6  k.    a map of hi emission integrated over the lsr velocity range @xmath9 @xmath0 to @xmath10 @xmath0 , is shown in figure 1a .",
    "the image shows the mushroom cloud extending vertically out of the galactic plane toward negative galactic latitudes .",
    "the `` stem '' of the mushroom extends about 3@xmath3 out of the plane into a mushroom `` cap '' that is about 2.5@xmath3 wide . at the bottom",
    "outside edges of the cap , two `` lobes '' extend back toward the plane on either side of the stem . at the top of the cap ,",
    "wispy filaments reach toward larger latitudes .",
    "we have not assumed apparently independent h  i features are part of the cloud .",
    "for example , the ring at @xmath11 is atomic gas surrounding the hii region s184 , which is at a distance of 2.2 @xmath12 0.7 kpc ( fich , private communication ) , and it would be speculative to assume this region is a component of the mushroom cloud .",
    "the velocity - latitude diagram in figure 1b , taken along longitude , -123.6@xmath3 which cuts through the stem and central cap ( see slice in figure 1a ) , shows that the stem emerges from the ambient hi in the mid - plane at a velocity of about @xmath13 @xmath0 . using the galactic rotation model of brand & blitz ( 1993 and presented in burton 1988 ) ,",
    "the kinematic distance is 3.8 @xmath12 1.2 kpc , placing the cloud in the inner edge of the perseus arm . at this distance",
    ", the mushroom cloud extends from @xmath14 pc ( where it becomes distinct from the disk emission ) to 420 pc , for a total projected length perpendicular to the plane of 350 pc , about three times larger than the estimate of koo  et  al.(1992 ) .",
    "the velocities along the stem become less negative as @xmath15 increases ( figure 1b ; clearer when stepping through the cube ) .",
    "the stem overlaps with the cap starting at about @xmath16 pc and @xmath17 @xmath0 , then extends an additional @xmath1880  pc into the cap .",
    "the stem is typically 35 - 40 pc wide and appears to have a cavity as well as a velocity signature indicating either expansion , contraction or helical motion .",
    "the central portion of the cap has little or no velocity gradient with respect to @xmath15 ( figure 1b ) or longitude ( figure 1d ) .",
    "however , figure 1c shows that the two lobes of the cap that extend back toward the plane are blueshifted with respect to the central cap region by 5 @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the wispy diffuse southeast parts of the cap are redshifted with respect to the main body of the cap .",
    "the velocity characteristics , presented in table  [ tablepar ] , were measured for the stem component , the cap subcomponents ( lobes , central region and wisps ) , and the entire mushroom cloud .",
    "velocity characteristics were obtained from brightness temperature ( @xmath19 ) versus velocity profiles averaged over visually selected regions of each component .",
    "the errors reflect the values measured for different baseline estimates and different box sizes surrounding the emission regions .",
    "the mass estimates in table 1 were obtained from column densities , integrated over the total velocity range for that component and averaged over the component spatially .",
    "these were also corrected for an average `` background '' column density .",
    "the mean excess column density of the mushroom above the background , over the velocity range of the entire structure , is @xmath20 @xmath21 , roughly equal to the average background over the same velocity range .",
    "the total hydrogen mass of the cap is then @xmath1 , and the average density of hydrogen atoms within the cap is @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the density in the ambient medium surrounding the mushroom is less well determined , since the distance of the column over the same velocity interval is not known .",
    "however the column is not likely to exceed about 1 kpc ( compared to about 200 pc for the mushroom ) , so the over - density between the mushroom and surrounding gas is not likely to exceed a factor of 5 .    using half the visually determined velocity range as an estimate of the average internal motion of each component , the internal kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas in the cap is @xmath24 ergs ( note : the velocity dispersion determined from the @xmath19 profile gives an energy estimate of a couple @xmath25 ergs ) .",
    "the radial velocity difference between the base of the stem and the mid - region of the cap is about 7 @xmath0 and the bulk kinetic energy of the cloud may be larger than the internal energy .",
    "nevertheless , the internal kinetic energy represents a minimum value for the energy of the event that gave rise to the the mushroom cloud .",
    "the velocity gradient within the stem of the mushroom cloud could be produced by accelerated streaming motion along the stem if the stem is tilted at at constant angle along its length with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the same effect could be produced without acceleration if the stem is the result of an ejection of material with a velocity range of order 10 @xmath0  ( higher velocity gas would appear furthest from the base ) .",
    "also , a gradient can be produced by a constant velocity flow with a monotonically changing inclination angle along the length of the stem .",
    "the data at hand may not allow us to resolve this ambiguity .",
    "preliminary analysis of hi absorption from background continuum sources through the cap indicate hydrogen spin temperatures of 50 to 100 k. the cap contains dust emission which is visible in all 4 iras passbands , becoming more apparent with increasing wavelength .",
    "there is no obvious diffuse soft x - ray emission in the energy range 0.1 - 2.0 kev , associated with any component of the cloud ( s. snowden , private communication ) .",
    "x - ray emission from hot gas that may be interior to the mushroom would be attenuated via absorption by the neutral gas along the line of sight . using the interstellar photoelectric absorption cross - section of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) and",
    "a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath26 @xmath21 , x - ray emission from gas with a temperature less than @xmath27 k will be absorbed .",
    "thus the lack of observed x - rays appears to rule out the existence of interior gas hotter than this .",
    "the mushroom cloud shape and mass distribution of gw123.4 - 1.5 pose a challenge to conventional superbubble scenarios . in these models ( e.g. , see mac low , mccray , & norman 1989 ; tenorio - tagle , rozyczka , & bodenheimer 1990 ) the lower part ( the stem ) retains the bulk of the mass , even though the upper part of the bubble ( the cap ) may expand to a large radius .",
    "this is not the case with gw123.4 - 1.5 , where we estimate that the cap contains about four times the mass in the stem .",
    "additionally the greatest cap to stem width ratio in the superbubble models is about 3:1 ( tenorio - tagle , rozyczka , & bodenheimer 1990 ) while the mushroom cloud s ratio is 6:1 .",
    "furthermore , the radius of the _ model _ stem is typically equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the exponential scale length of the local gaussian density distribution ; the stem is the cavity created by a blowout from a stratified atmosphere into a uniform low - density halo ( at @xmath18500 pc ) .",
    "if the local scale length were equal to the global average of the hi disk @xmath30 pc ( dickey & lockman  1990 ) , then the width of the mushroom s stem would be 500 pc rather than the @xmath18 40 pc observed .",
    "the above discrepancies lead us to consider alternate scenarios in which a stem plus cap morphology can be realized .",
    "for example , an h  i jet could be ejected from the disk and a wide lobe could be created where it has stalled , possibly falling back to the disk in a fountain - like manner . one possible origin for such an event is the passage of a high velocity cloud through the galactic disk and the subsequent emergence of gas on the other side ( tenorio - tagle et  al .",
    "however , here we consider the rise of buoyant gas . a rising fireball after a terrestrial nuclear explosion creates a structure strikingly similar to that of gw123.4 - 1.5 . in the interstellar context , mushroom - shaped clouds can arise from the interaction between different components in a multiphase medium ( e.g. rosen & bregman 1995 , avillez 1999 ) , including a cloud - cloud collision ( miniati et al .",
    "1997 ) . for our model , we focus on the rise of buoyant hot gas resulting from a single supernova event . jones ( 1973 ) has investigated the early evolution of a supernova remnant and found signs of buoyant rise . here",
    ", we follow to late times the evolution of a remnant which does not have enough energy to blow out of the disk atmosphere .",
    "the initially pressure driven hot bubble stalls at radius smaller than the scale height of the medium .",
    "buoyancy forces lift the low density bubble out of the galactic plane and through the stratified atmosphere . in analogy with the nuclear fireball ,",
    "the quasi - vacuum produced under the rising cap may pull in surrounding material , entraining it to form the stem . in this case",
    ", the stem width is not determined by the scale height of the medium and can be quite narrow .",
    "however the existence of cold neutral material in the cap must still be explained since the rise of a buoyant plume in pressure equilibrium does not physically move much material from the galactic disk to high latitudes .    to examine the plausibility of the buoyant bubble scenario we have begun modeling a single 10@xmath31 ergs explosion at 60 pc above the midplane using a modified zeus 2-d code ( e.g. stone & norman  1992 ) .",
    "our simulations include the effects of radiative cooling , heat conduction , and the vertical gravitational field .",
    "we also use artificially low quiescent gas density to reduce the influence of  numerical diffusion \" , a computational artifact resulting from steep gradients .",
    "for example , we use a scale height 60 pc , is more likely to exist if the z - distribution of the ambient gas is @xmath32 pc . ] and a midplane number density of @xmath33 to create an ambient medium distribution which allows bubbles to form and evolve .",
    "our preliminary low - resolution models are intentionally generic and detailed comparisons with gw123.4 - 1.5 will be left to a later paper . in both gaussian and exponential atmospheres ,",
    "a bubble forms interior to the blastwave and , rather than elongating vertically as in a conventional superbubble , the bubble rises buoyantly .",
    "since the rise is supersonic relative to the cooled gas above ( interior to the blastwave ) , the bubble accumulates cold ambient gas in a snow - plow mode along its shock front .",
    "gas also flows upwards in a column following the bubble , contributing to its evolution into a mushroom - shaped cloud . by 8 myr",
    "the interior bubble has the kinetic temperature distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ figmodel]a .",
    "the models show a cold gas stem which is narrower than the primary bubble ( stem ) in conventional superbubble scenarios in which the stem width is dictated by the gas scale height .",
    "our modeled stem is expected to become narrower and more obvious than shown here when a higher ambient density is used and cooling becomes more efficient .",
    "the coolest temperatures trace a curlyqued cap structure like that observed in gw 123.5 - 1.5 .",
    "these structures are also evident in the column density map , plotted for gas @xmath347500 k , in fig .",
    "[ figmodel]b .",
    "similar to some models of supernova evolution ( slavin & cox  1992 ) the hottest gas in our simulation decreases to fill a small volume which eventually collapses .",
    "residing just inside the skin of the lobes are remnants of a warm gas envelope , formed by heat conduction , which had been pushed away from the bubble by the upward flow of cold , dense gas from the stem .",
    "their temperature of a few @xmath35 k is consistent with the lack of soft x - ray emission .",
    "the cool , h  i by - product of the buoyant bubble should be observable for substantially longer than the cooling time ( @xmath36  yr ) of this hot gas .",
    "we have carried out a preliminary search in other wavebands for evidence of a possible energy source , but no obvious candidates can be identified .",
    "for example , there are no iras sources near the base with co emission in the fcrao database ( between the midplane and - 3@xmath37 galactic latitude ) within the fwhm velocity range of the stem",
    ". the projected position of the h  ii emitting reflection nebula sharpless  185 lies near the base of the stem .",
    "however , it is associated with the be x - ray emitting star @xmath38 cass at a distance of only about two hundred pc ( see blouin et  al .",
    "1997 ) .",
