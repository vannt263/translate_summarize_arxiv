    "gradients in a gravitational field may cause the production of particles out of the vacuum ; this is similar to the situation in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in the latter case a virtual pair of particles is ripped apart by the electric field .",
    "in contrast to qed , the gravitational ` charge'the mass  is always positive ; in this case , the tidal forces are thus responsible for the separation of the particle pair .",
    "but there is also another difference .",
    "the energy that is needed for the production of particles in a charged vacuum is taken out of the field energy .",
    "since the energy of the gravitational field can not be localised , the energy gain must be explained otherwise .",
    "one possibility is the existence of a horizon .",
    "another possibility is the time dependence of the gravitational field .",
    "we compute the particle production in a time - dependent gravitational field induced by an expanding mass shell .",
    "this is done at a semiclassical level .",
    "the gravitational field , which acts through curvature of space - time , is treated as a classical background field in which a quantum field propagates .",
    "we consider a massless scalar field .",
    "so it is quantum field theory in curved space that we need to apply .",
    "perhaps the best known result in this field is the thermal radiation emitted by a black hole .",
    "this effect , discovered by hawking @xcite , shows a deep connection between gravity , thermodynamics and quantum physics . hawking s result",
    "was reproduced in several ways , but also other problems such as unruh s accelerated observer @xcite or the gravitational analogue to the casimir effect @xcite were studied .    in cosmological models ,",
    "the production of particles plays a central role in explaining the origin of the structures observed in the universe . during an epoch of cosmological inflation , quantum fluctuations of space - time and",
    "matter are amplified by the accelerated expansion of the universe to become the seeds of large - scale structures @xcite .",
    "all mentioned examples involve either a horizon , a boundary , or a singularity . to our knowledge",
    ", there exists no example in which particle production in an infinite space - time without horizon and without singularity has been calculated .",
    "the situation of an expanding mass shell represents such an example .",
    "we do not expect this work to have a direct astrophysical application , but the situation under study might be of interest when black holes evaporate .",
    "one could imagine that hawking radiation is emitted from an evaporating black hole in a final burst , which we could then describe as a thin shell , carrying a mass somewhat larger than the planck mass .",
    "if the emitted radiation consists of massive particles , this mass shell moves at a speed slightly below the speed of light and our calculation might be applicable .",
    "since the expanding mass shell itself leads to gravitational particle production , this work might be useful for an estimate of backreaction effects in the final stages of black hole evaporation .",
    "we will not study this aspect here , the purpose of this paper being just to calculate the energy spectrum of the particles produced by an expanding mass shell .",
    "there are three main procedures that are used to deal with quantum fields in curved space - time : hawking s classical ray - tracing @xcite , renormalization of the energy - momentum tensor ( e.g.  by point - splitting ) @xcite , particle production in the reference frame of a uniformly accelerated observer @xcite , from which we will choose the first one .",
    "a useful overview on computational matters can be found in @xcite .",
    "the procedure of ray - tracing in a semiclassical limit is appropriate if the energy carried by the quantum field is small with respect to the energy of the source of the gravitational field .",
    "furthermore we have to stay on scales on which possible effects of quantum gravity do not occur . as wheeler showed in @xcite the characteristic length for this to happen",
    "is the planck length @xmath0 cm .",
    "so we have to restrict our results to cases in which the effects of interest take place on scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , it seems that there is no reason to restrict the calculation to masses @xmath3 , as long as the mass shell starts to expand at a radius @xmath1 .",
    "we set @xmath4 in the following .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we will need to find an observable of particle density in curved space , which will be done in section 2 .",
    "after this we will introduce our model of the expanding mass shell and discuss its properties .",
    "the computation of the number density operator is presented in section 4 .",
    "the results are discussed in section 5 , which contains plots of the spectral energy flux and total energy flux through a 2-dimensional surface .",
    "we conclude with a short summary .",
    "let us first recall some of the basics of quantum field theory in curved space - time @xcite .",
    "physics in flat space - time is invariant under poincar transformations .",
    "this singles out a set of ( fourier ) modes and a vacuum state , which are invariant under poincar transformations . in curved space - time",
    "there is no global poincar symmetry .    in the following we consider a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "its fourier modes in flat space are attached to the energy @xmath6 by @xmath7 this uniqueness is lost when the coordiates are chosen arbitrarily . in curved space - time",
    "we have no distinguished time coordinate , thus no distinguished energy belonging to it , and no distinguished set of modes that can be related to the notion of particles . in general",
    "we have to deal with an arbitrary set of modes @xmath8 and ask for its relation to a different set @xmath9 .",
    "the quantum field @xmath10 can then be expanded in both sets : @xmath11 the relations between these sets are given by the so - called bogoliubov transformations @xcite and have the form : @xmath12 with @xmath13 and the scalar product given by @xmath14              \\sqrt{-g_\\sigma}\\ ; \\mathrm{d}\\sigma^{\\mu}\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath15 is a space - like hypersurface with volume element @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a normal vector of @xmath15 with norm @xmath19 .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators ( [ phiua ] ) depend on the modes , and so does the vacuum state defined with respect to them .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath20 belongs to @xmath21 and is defined by @xmath22 . in general , @xmath20 is not identical with @xmath23 , for which we have @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that the vacuum expectation value of the number density operator @xmath25 must not necessarily vanish when applied to the vacuum @xmath20 , @xmath26 this operator has a well defined meaning as the number ( mode ) density operator only if the modes used for the expansion can be put in a suitable relation to the known modes of minkowski space - time to render an interpretation possible .",
    "this is possible if we are interested in the change of vacuum between two asymptotically flat regions of space - time .",
    "if the eigenvalues are not discrete @xmath27 , we have to deal with an integral that may have divergences .",
    "these divergences caused by the limit from periodic boundary conditions with discrete spectrum to an infinite volume @xmath28 can be cured by normalization .",
    "this may be accomplished by dividing through the same divergence : @xmath29 if @xmath30 has the form @xmath31 , one finds @xmath32 which will be useful later on .",
    "now @xmath33 is the well defined spectral number ( mode ) density .",
    "we consider a spherical shell of mass @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 . outside of the shell , space - time",
    "is described by the schwarzschild metric ; inside it space - time is flat .",
    "we assume that the thickness of the shell in negligible with respect to its radius ( thin shell ) . originally the shell s radius is constant , @xmath36 .",
    "the shell is ` ignited ' at some time @xmath37 ( as measured in the rest frame of the total mass inside the shell ) .",
    "afterwards the shell expands as @xmath38 .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the non - equilibrium situation more hard particles and less soft particles are produced at a fixed value of @xmath139 .    in fig .",
    "[ erg2 ] we see , as expected , that an increase in @xmath196 causes a shift of the maximum towards smaller frequencies .",
    "furthermore the whole curve flattens quickly for increasing @xmath196 .",
    "remember that , according to the considerations presented in the last section , an increasing radius ( which changes @xmath139 and @xmath141 ) dominates the evolution of the spectral energy flux during the expansion .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ erg4 ] .",
    "finally we come to the emitted energy flux through a 2-dimensional surface , @xmath201 .    in fig .",
    "[ gesamten ] we see the energy flux as a function of radius for different values of @xmath64 . at large values of @xmath202",
    "no particles are produced , since the mass shell moves inertially ( the tidal forces go to zero ) .",
    "however , more interesting is the maximum of the curve that appears for ultra - relativistic velocities @xmath64 .",
    "this reflects the fact that two effects are working against each other during the expansion .",
    "the probability of particle production depends on the strength of the tidal forces acting on the vacuum locally .",
    "the tidal forces decrease monotonically as the mass shell expands .",
    "once particles have been created , they have to climb out of the gravitational potential well of the mass shell itself ( gravitational redshift ) .",
    "this effect reduces the energy of the produced particles . at the schwarzschild radius",
    "the energy would be reduced to zero . for an ultrarelativistic mass shell the tidal forces change very quickly and thus",
    "the particle production is large .",
    "close to the schwarzschild radius however , this is counteracted by the gravitational redshift , giving rise to a maximum slightly away from @xmath203 .",
    "we computed the spectrum of particles produced by the time - dependent gravitational field of an expanding mass shell .",
    "this system is  as long as no horizon forms  invariant under time - reversal , so that we can describe an expanding shell as well as a collapsing shell before the formation of a horizon .",
    "if the horizon is formed , the system gets quasi - static for the asymptotic observer and the effect is `` frozen '' . in this way",
    "we can reproduce the result of hawking radiation .",
    "in the situation of an expanding mass shell the spectrum is non - thermal .",
    "our result might be of relevance for the discussion of evaporating black holes .",
    "in the situation of a collapsing mass shell , we obtain the deviations from the planck spectrum of hawking radiation , which is produced just before the horizon forms .",
    "djs thanks the austrian academy of sciences for financial support .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    to show that @xmath204   \\mbox{d}\\omega_+\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is finite ( for @xmath205 ) , it is sufficient to show that @xmath206 which means that it has an upper bound for @xmath207 since the second term in ( [ beid ] ) does not depend on @xmath153 anyhow . we are then left with an integral over @xmath208 that is finite .",
    "if we succeed in showing that ( [ zeig ] ) is true , we know that the first term does not increase faster for large @xmath153 and therefore is finite too .",
    "it is @xmath209 @xmath210 being the path of integration in the upper right quadrant of the complex plane and therefore is @xmath211 $ ] on @xmath210 .",
    "this yields @xmath212 putting this together we have @xmath213 which shows that ( [ beid ] ) is finite , as claimed .",
