    "the most spectacular phenomenon associated with granular matter is certainly the phase segregation that one observes when a granular mixture is shaked , poured or rotated @xcite . respectively ,",
    "stripe @xcite , axial @xcite and radial @xcite segregation patterns have been reported .",
    "recent experiments @xcite and theoretical models @xcite have been extensively performed in the particular case of stripe segregation .    however , the least studied type of segregation is the case of the axial segregation in the so - called oyama s drum @xcite .",
    "the experiment consists in rotating a tube which is half filled with a sand mixture .",
    "the mixture is composed by 2 granular species differing in size and having different angles of repose . due to the rotation , avalanches occur in the tube .",
    "bands of the different granular species appear after a few minutes . a sketch and a picture of the axial segregation",
    "are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "it has been reported @xcite that the bands merge and only three stripes remain after very long times .",
    "one should also remark that magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) experiments have shown that a radial segregation is also present in the center of the tube @xcite .",
    "small grains being located in the center of the tube .",
    "0.3 cm    on the theoretical side , it has been proposed @xcite that the axial segregation is similar to a spinodal decomposition . a simple and elegant model for diffusion of the different sand species along the tube axis has also been proposed by savage @xcite .",
    "this model considers the difference @xmath0 of dynamical angles for both species as a relevant parameter .",
    "if @xmath1 is the density of one species along the tube axis @xmath2 , the different slopes involve a segregation flux @xmath3 for that species .",
    "the positive coefficient @xmath4 is a function of the slope difference @xmath0 and the rotation speed @xmath5 of the tube . in addition , a fickian diffusion @xmath6 is taken into account .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath7 is a function of the rotation speed @xmath5 . summing both fluxes and taking into account the continuity equation for @xmath8 ,",
    "one @xcite obtains the classical diffusion equation @xmath9 with an effective diffusion constant @xmath10 which could be negative for defined @xmath0 and @xmath5 values .",
    "a negative coefficient explains the formation of bands because any inhomogeneity in @xmath11 is then amplified towards full segregation .",
    "the savage s model is a first step in the understanding of the phenomenon .",
    "the most elaborated model remains the one proposed by zik and coworkers @xcite . in the zik s model",
    ", @xmath4 scales as @xmath12 and the occurence of bands is attributed to a spinodal decomposition instead of a simple diffusion .",
    "more recently , molecular dynamics simulations have also been performed @xcite in order to study the effect of friction .",
    "axial segregation can be simulated with thousand of virtual grains .",
    "we have performed new experiments in the oyama s drum .",
    "we have produced axial segregation patterns and studied the phenomenon during several hours / days . in some experiments",
    ", we have obtained spectacular patterns that we call _ instabilities_. the present paper deals with such unusual patterns .",
    "they are discussed in the light of previous theoretical arguments and earlier experiments .",
    "mechanisms for instabilities appearance are proposed .",
    "our experimental setup is the following . a glass tube ( diameter @xmath13 mm , length @xmath14 mm ) is half filled with a binary sand mixture .",
    "the tube is rotated at a constant angular frequency @xmath5 which can be controlled .",
    "the rotation speed can range from 20 rotations per minute ( rpm ) to 40 rpm .",
    "the tube in rotation is perfectly horizontal .",
    "two different sands have been selected for our study . for each type of sand ,",
    "the granulometry has been selected by sifting .",
    "white grains have a mean diameter around @xmath15 mm .",
    "black grains have a mean diameter around @xmath16 mm .",
    "the angle of repose for dark grains is @xmath17 .",
    "the angle of repose for the white grains is @xmath18 .",
    "repose angles of different species have been measured by averaging the slope of a stable pile of the considered species along its surface .",
    "a ccd camera captures the pattern along the tube axis every minute .",
    "a computer collects the successive pictures .",
    "each picture of the glass tube is rescaled into a line of pixels .",
    "this line represents the average density of the sand species along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the successive lines of pixels are numerically glued together in order to form a space - time diagram of the evolving segregation pattern .",
    "figure 2 presents a typical spatio - temporal graph built with 3840 images of the pattern , for a total period of 64 hours . in the picture",
    ", time goes down .",
    "the segregation pattern emerges within a few minutes . after a long time",
    "( several hours ) , the bands begin to merge .",
    "the merging of adjacent bands is rare .",
    "however , such an event is a rapid process ( typically less than one minute ) since the end part of a vanishing band is always abrupt .",
    "see three vanishing bands in the top of figure 2 .",
    "the number @xmath19 of bands seems to decrease exponentially with time .",
    "figure 3 emphasizes such a decay for the particular data of figure 2 .",
    "we have fitted those data with the stretched exponential @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the initial number of bands and @xmath22 being a characteristic time for the decay .",
    "the data for others space - time graphs obtained with our setup are also well fitted with this empirical law .",
    "a systematic study of that particular dynamics is under way and will be published elsewhere @xcite . before looking at the details , we can make 3 general observations :    \\(1 ) the segregation begins first at the extremities of the tube and then nucleates randomly in the tube .",
    "the spreading pattern formation is emphasized in figure 4 .",
    "the presence of tube ends ( walls ) affects locally the friction and induces the formation of bands at the extremities .",
    "we have noticed that at low rotation speeds ( @xmath23 rpm ) , bands appear only at the extremities while the middle part of the tube is still mixed , even for very long times .",
    "\\(2 ) the topography of the granular surface is deeply affected by the segregation pattern",
    ". a close look at the surface reveals different slopes for the different sand species ( see the top picture of figure 1 ) .",
    "those slopes correspond to the dynamical angles of the species , which are @xmath24 larger than the repose angles .",
    "this is the main ingredient of both savage @xcite and zik @xcite models .",
    "\\(3 ) for very long times , the pattern tends to a complete segregation of both granular species .",
    "only two bands are observed . this complete segregation",
    "is clearly observed at the end of figure 2 .",
    "one should remark that frette and stavans @xcite did not always obtain a complete segregation pattern even after having performed very long experiences ( but at a lower speed than in our cases ) .    in the great majority of our experiments , the successive merging of bands towards a full segregation of both granular species have been observed . however , looking at the details of figure 2 , one observes a turbulent - like pattern at the interface between white and dark bands .",
    "this particular event occured after 18 hours of rotation .",
    "the turbulent pattern is emphasized in figure 5 .",
    "the duration of that event lasted about 5 hours .",
    "the instability of white / dark interfaces began when a new dark band nucleated in the middle part of a white band .",
    "this nucleation process involved the development of secondary bands in the neighborhood .",
    "extremely slow undulations of the borders are also seen in the bottom of figure 2 , a long time after the ` turbulent ' event emphasized in figure 5 .",
    "the occurrence of such behavior is still mysterious .",
    "we did not discover the precise conditions on which they appear and disappear .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the occurence of such patterns is not an artefact .",
    "indeed , they appeared in different experiments under various conditions , i.e. at various rotation speeds .",
    "moreover , initial mixtures were premixed as homogeneously as possible .",
    "figures 6 and 7 present additional patterns that we have also obtained . in those examples ,",
    "the instability does not affect the total number of bands along the tube axis . in figure 5",
    ", one observes undulations of the borders of white bands .",
    "in fact , thin dark bands nucleate periodically in the center of white bands before being expelled . in figure 6 , the situation is slightly different : two small bands are seen to detach from a white band and to travel from that band towards the next one .",
    "some instabilities are provoked by the nucleation of thin dark bands ( see figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "others appear at the border of apparently stable white bands ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "we will discuss the occurence of that phenomena in the next section .",
    "it should be noted that an earlier experimental work @xcite put into evidence some travelling waves in the tube .",
    "this behavior was present for higher filling fraction of the tube ( @xmath25% ) than in our experiments .",
    "such travelling waves were associated with the early stages of the segregation ( about 20 minutes ) , when inhomogeneities of the initial mixture provoke the nucleation and the motion of bands . herein , the instabilities are seen to occur after very long times and last several hours .",
    "the nature of the instabilities could be quite different from those reported in @xcite .",
    "as mentionned at the beginning of this paper , mri experiments @xcite have put into evidence that radial segregation is always present .",
    "small grains ( the dark species herein ) tend to segregate in the bulk .",
    "this implies that in our experiments , the white bands may have a dark core .",
    "we assist thus at the competition between axial and radial segregation in that regions .",
    "any fluctuation of the radial pattern may provoke the nucleation of a thin dark band .",
    "thereafter , this thin band travels slowly towards one border to be expelled .",
    "this coupling between surface and volume compositions could explain the instabilities .",
    "surface and bulk processes are characterized by different time scales .",
    "axial segregation has a larger characteristic time scale than radial segregation .",
    "this rate difference could also explain why our instabilities last several hours : the phenomenon comes from bulk fluctuations .",
    "mri experiments could corroborate those mechanisms .",
    "consider the fraction of dark species @xmath2 observed along the tube , measured by image analysis .",
    "figure 8 presents the time evolution of the ratio @xmath26 in the long experiment of figure 5 .",
    "the ratio @xmath27 emphasizes the surface ` equilibrium ' between both species along the tube . during the whole process",
    ", the ratio fluctuates around a linear trend close to @xmath28 .",
    "however , during a period of instability , we observe giant fluctuations of @xmath27 up to @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the compositions of both bulk and surface deviate strongly from equilibrium composition .",
    "bulk segregation should be taken into account when axial patterns are discussed .",
    "oyama s drum experiment is an example of 3-dimensional segregation .",
    "this has been already suggested by hill et al @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have reported hereabove additional effects such as long lasting instabilities which arise from bulk processes .",
    "the dynamics of those patterns are extremely slow with respect to the formation / vanishing of the bands .",
    "we stress that those instabilities originate from the competition between _ axial _ and _ radial _ segregations . as a consequence ,",
    "the savage model , which considers only surface effects should be extended to take into account the bulk distribution of granular species .",
    "the physical conditions , such as rotation speed and granulometry , which imply the formation of instabilities , are still unclear .",
    "this point needs a systematic experimental study .",
    "this represents a huge amount of work since each experiment lasts several hours .",
    "hc is financially supported by the fria ( brussels , belgium ) .",
    "this work is also suppported through the arc contract n@xmath3002/07 - 293 .",
    "the authors would also like to thank m. ausloos for fruitful discussions ."
