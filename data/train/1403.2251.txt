    "devices based on conventional lenses can not offer resolution better than half of the operating wavelength due to diffraction limit as well as rayleigh criterion of half of the operating wavelength @xcite .",
    "imaging below the half wavelength resolution ( @xmath0 ) or in subwavelength scale requires capturing evanescent waves which vanishes exponentially as it travels away from the source and requires time - consuming point - by - point scanning by near - field scanning microscopy @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to overcome these restrictions , several imaging techniques were proposed in last decades including perfect lens , silver super - lens , hyper - lens , stimulated emission depletion ( sted ) fluorescence microscope etc . @xcite . besides these , metallic wire media as subwavelength imaging system was also proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , a complete procedure to model such a metallic nanowire based lens for imaging in the visible range was discussed in @xcite . + in the case of subwavelength imaging at optical frequency , the main focus was on manipulating the length of nanowire array ( @xmath1 ) to improve resolution of the image @xcite . even though , the concept of finding optimal parameters to achieve sub - wavelength imaging was investigated by optimizing the length of the rod array @xcite .",
    "kosulnikov _ et . al .",
    "_ drew attention to the effect of filling factors ( defined as @xmath2 , where,`@xmath3 ' is the radius of the nanorods and ` @xmath4 ' is the lattice constant ) at infrared range @xcite .",
    "these types of investigations are even more necessary in the optical range since it is very difficult to maintain accurate dimensions of nanowire array as the radius of the wire medium is much smaller than the skin depth ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus in the context of practical realization , where the unit is counted in nanometer , the values of optimal length and radius ensure the ultimate limit of error in the manufacturing process . in this paper , we have calculated the optimal filling ratios ( ratio of the rod cross - sectional area with the lattice cross - sectional area ) and hence the range of radius allowed to achieve imaging . through full wave electromagnetic simulations",
    "we have established our findings using infinitesimal silver nanorod array in equilateral triangular or , hexagonal lattice arrangement with two different cross - sectional geometries .",
    "nanorod array with cylindrical @xcite , triangular @xcite and square @xcite porous matrices for fabrication was realized using different substrate material as shown in fig .",

    "-[],width=328 ]    in our analysis , we have considered filling ratio , @xmath6 for cylindrical shaped wire array and @xmath7 for triangular shaped wire array . here",
    "the parameter ` @xmath4 ' is known as periodicity or lattice constant of the array and ` @xmath3 ' is the radius of circular cross - section of cylindrical shape fig.[fig:2](d ) and also represents the distance of the polished edged equilateral triangular cross - section fig.[fig:2](e ) . in this manner",
    "we compute the allowable filling ratios or radius for both cross - sectional geometries and found triangular rod array offers higher filling ratio tolerances than the cylindrical one while other parameters like periodicity ` @xmath4 ' and length ` @xmath1 ' were kept unchanged .",
    "the schematic view of the unit cell and silver nanorod array with triangular lattice arrangement are shown in fig . [ fig:2 ] which has been numerically modeled using commercial full - wave electromagnetic simulator cst^tm^ studio suite @xcite .",
    "the rod length is set to be 80 nm for both the geometries with the same periodicity of 40 nm .",
    "we have used drude dispersion model for the permittivity of _ ag _ which was defined as @xmath8 where , @xmath9 = 4.9638 , @xmath10 rad / s and @xmath11/s @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the imaging capabilities of this device with discrete coherent source which were formed by six in - phase point sources polarized along the rod length ( @xmath12-axis ) and placed on the rod axis forming a hexagon , as shown in fig .",

    "hexagonal point source ( b ) source plane and ( c - k ) image plane for @xmath3=6 - 14 nm respectively.,width=328 ]    in order to show the impact of filling ratio , we have examined the @xmath14-field distributions calculated at the image plane ( 10 nm away from the back interface ) at 614thz for a range of filling ratios ( @xmath15 or , @xmath16 ) as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:3 ] the radii , _ r _ = 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 nm , the image plane field distributions matches with the one obtained in the source plane .",
    "however for other values of ` @xmath3 ' field distributions at the image plane gives us misleading views of the source plane .",
    "it is evident from the figure that for a rod radius larger than 12 nm the image plane field distribution gives an impression of single point source located at the center of the hexagon , whereas for a rod radius smaller than 9 nm extremely inconsistent images are produced .",
    "in order to validate the results obtained in the previous section we have calculated the transmission coefficients of such an array applying transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization . the architecture of the unit cell",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) for radii ( filling ratio ) between @xmath17 .",

    "@xcite because they successfully proved that the best image is achieved at 614thz corresponds to the aforementioned rod length .",
    "the periodicity ` @xmath4 ' of the nanorod array has been set to a constant value of 40 nm as in @xcite .",
    "transmission and reflection coefficients for various filling ratio , ` @xmath20 ' have been calculated by changing the radius from 6 nm to 15 nm with an increment of 1 nm . + the transmission coefficients calculated as a function of @xmath21 ( transverse wave vector along @xmath19-axis ) for various radii of the nanorod are plotted in fig .",

    "@xcite that a good imaging capability requires a constant transmission phase in addition to a flat transmission coefficient magnitude over the range of transverse wave vector corresponding to the evanescent wave region . +     while the radius varied from 6 nm to 14 nm with 1 nm resolution ( a - i).,width=328 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the reflection and transmission phase for different radii varying from 7 to 14 nm .",
    "it is evident that rod radii from 9 to 12 nm produce constant phase while the rest demonstrates significant variations over the ranges of evanescent harmonics .",
    "a constant transmission phase ensures that all evanescent harmonics propagate through the rod array and reach the image plane simultaneously .",
    "any variation appearing in the transmission phase leads to distortion and hence a misleading image of the source . +        from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we see that for the rod radius of 7 , 8 , 13 and 14 nm the phases of the transmission coefficients exhibit considerable variations and thus prevents the formation of an @xmath14-field distributions at the image plane which matches with that of the source plane .",
    "note that in contrast to the phases of transmission coefficients , the reflection coefficient phases exhibits sudden jumps in the evanescent wave region .",
    "+            from fig . [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] we can see that for 9 - 12 nm rod radius we get identifiable images .",
    "however it is observed beyond this range @xmath14-field distributions of image plane does not match with that of the source plane .",
    "the radii that failed to produce a recognizable image at 614thz have been found to work well at other frequencies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] . for a rod radius of 8 nm ,",
    "the lens works best at 550 thz ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) , whereas , for the radius of 13 nm the best image was observed at around 600thz ( fig . [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "finally we calculated the corresponding operational bandwidth for 8 nm ( @xmath22 ) and 13 nm ( @xmath23 ) which is 16.82% and 12.39% respectively .",
    "in this section , we have made an effort to change the cross - sectional geometry of the cylindrical nanowire and observed its impact on the imaging capability of the lens .",
    "we have employed nanorod having triangular cross - section ( with polished edge ) and examined its performance .",
    "the @xmath14-field distributions , taken at the source and the image plane in 614thz demonstrate that the nano - lens offers good fidelity for the rod radii of 10 nm and 13 nm shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "thus it is understandable that for any radius between 10 - 13 nm inclusive ( filling ratio : @xmath24 ) , the device would be operated satisfactorily .",

    "the magnitudes of transmission coefficients plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows reasonably acceptable behavior for the radii of 8 , 10 , 13 and 15 nm .",
    "the phases , however , exhibit superior behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , only for 10 and 13 nm radii .",
    "they demonstrate non - varying characteristics that actually enable the device to function properly .",
    "the improper images of the source obtained at image planes for 8 and 15 nm are attributed to the varying nature of the phases that dilute the image quality and preclude the device from functioning properly .",
    "note that the @xmath14-field distribution at the image plane obtained with 15 nm radius is associated with undesired fields and thus resulting in a very noisy image that is hardly recognizable , whereas , for the radius of 8 nm the image is characterized by uneven field intensity for the point sources thus giving a different definition of the source than the actual one .",
    "+                similar to the circular cross - section , we have also noticed for triangular cross - section that the filling ratios those failed to produce any image at 614thz have been found to work at other frequencies as demonstrated in fig .",

    "we have summarized our studies in table [ table1 ] that contains information about the operating band for different radii and hence the filling ratios .",
    "note that the quality of the image becomes poor at higher filling ratio for both the circular and triangular geometries and may be attributed to the increased coupling between surface plasmons of adjacent rods .",
    "the idiosyncratic shift of operating frequency range with the change in filling ratio can also be due to the varying degree of coupling with the changing radius .",
    "thus the behavior of nanolens in the visible domain is much more complex than it is in the microwave regime .",
