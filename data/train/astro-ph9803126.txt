    "elliptical galaxies do not show the presence of hii regions and it is not possible to resolve single stars in them in order to measure photospheric abundances .",
    "therefore , most of the information on these objects is obtained from their integrated properties : abundances are derived either through colors or integrated spectra and in both cases the derived information is a complicated measure of metallicity and age ( the well known age - metallicity degeneracy ) .",
    "the most common metallicity indicators are @xmath2 and @xmath1 , as originally defined in faber et al .",
    "( 1977 ; 1985 ) .",
    "population synthesis techniques are adopted to analyze the integrated properties of ellipticals and to derive an estimate of their real abundances .",
    "unfortunately , they contain several uncertainties residing either in incomplete knowledge of stellar evolution or in deficiencies in stellar libraries , as discussed in charlot et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in recent years",
    "more and more population synthesis models ( bruzual and charlot , 1993 ; buzzoni et al . , 1992 ; bressan et al . , 1994 ;",
    "gibson , 1997 ; bressan et al .",
    ", 1996 ; gibson and matteucci , 1997 ; tantalo et al . , 1998 ) have appeared but the basic uncertainties still remain . in this paper",
    "we want to focus our attention about the comparison between theoretical model results and metallicity indicators . in this framework",
    "we will analyze the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 and its implications for the mechanism of galaxy formation .    several authors ( faber et al . 1992 ; worthey et al . 1992 ; carollo et al . 1993 ; davies et al .",
    "1993 ; carollo and danziger 1994 ) , from comparison of the observed indices with synthetic indices , concluded that the average @xmath3_{*}$ ] in giant ellipticals must be larger than the solar value .",
    "this result was also confirmed by the analysis of weiss et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who made use , for the first time , of stellar evolutionary tracks calculated under the assumption of non - solar ratios.the same authors found that the @xmath1 versus @xmath2 relation among nuclei of giant ellipticals is rather flat and flatter than within galaxies . from the flat behavior of @xmath1 vs. @xmath0",
    "the same authors inferred that the abundance of mg should increase faster than the abundance of fe among nuclei of giant ellipticals .",
    "this conclusion is at variance with the predictions of supernova - driven wind models of ellipticals ( arimoto and yoshii , 1987 ; matteucci and tornamb 1987 ) .",
    "in fact , matteucci and tornamb ( 1987 ) showed that , in the framework of the classic wind model for ellipticals , the [ mg / fe ] ratio is a decreasing function of the galactic mass and luminosity .",
    "the reason for this behavior is clear : if fe is mostly produced by the supernovae of type ia , as it seems to be the case in our galaxy ( greggio and renzini 1983a ; matteucci and greggio 1986 ) , whereas mg is mostly originating from supernovae of type ii , then the iron production is delayed relative to that of mg and its abundance should be larger in more massive galaxies which develop a wind later than the less massive ones .",
    "all of this is valid under the assumption that after the onset of a galactic wind star formation should stop or should be negligible , which is a reasonable assumption for elliptical galaxies .",
    "faber et al .",
    "( 1992 ) proposed alternative scenarios to the classic supernova driven wind model , as originally proposed by larson ( 1974 ) .",
    "they suggested three different scenarios all based on the assumption that mg is produced by type ii supernovae and fe is mostly produced by type ia supernovae : i ) a selective loss of metals , ii ) a variable initial mass function ( imf ) and iii ) different timescales for star formation .",
    "these hypotheses were discussed by matteucci ( 1994 ) , who tested them in the context of chemical evolution models . in the hypothesis of the different timescales for star formation matteucci ( 1994 ) suggested that the more massive ellipticals might experience a much stronger and faster star formation than less massive ellipticals leading to a situation where the most massive objects are able to develop galactic winds before the less massive ones .",
    "she called this case `` inverse wind model '' . on the other hand , in the classic wind model of larson ( 1974 )",
    "the efficiency of star formation was the same for all galaxies thus leading to the fact that the galactic wind in more massive systems occurs later than in less massive ones , due to their deeper potential well .",
    "in the models of arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) and matteucci and tornamb ( 1987 ) the efficiency of star formation was a decreasing function of galactic mass , based on the assumption that the timescale for star formation is proportional to the cloud - cloud collision timescale which , in turn , is proportional to the gas density .",
    "therefore , since in this monolithic collapse picture the gas density decreases with the galactic mass , the galactic wind was even more delayed for the most massive systems .",
    "matteucci ( 1994 ) proposed , as an alternative , a star formation efficiency increasing with the galactic mass and she justified this assumption by imagining that giant elliptical galaxies , instead of forming through a monolithic collapse of a gas cloud , form by merging of gaseous protoclouds .",
    "the merging process can , in fact , produce higher densities for increasing galactic mass and/or higher cloud - cloud collision velocities resulting in a faster star formation process .",
    "in such a model the galactic wind occurs earlier in massive than in smaller ellipticals thus producing the expected trend of an increasing [ mg / fe ] as a function of galactic mass .",
    "matteucci ( 1994 ) also showed that a variable imf with the slope decreasing with increasing galactic mass and luminosity can produce the same effect without an inverse wind situation .",
    "the reason for that resides in the fact that a flatter imf slope favors massive stars relative to low and intermediate masses , thus favoring mg production over fe production .",
    "however , matteucci ( 1994 ) could not translate the predicted abundances into @xmath0 and @xmath1 since there were no available calibrations for [ fe / h ] versus @xmath1 but only calibrations for @xmath4 $ ] vs. @xmath0 .",
    "therefore she did not compare the predicted abundances with observations .",
    "recently , calibrations for the iron index have become available ( borges et al .",
    ", 1995 ; tantalo et al . ,",
    "1998 ) and therefore in this paper we revisit the whole problem of inferring trends on the real abundances by metallicity indices and we discuss the influence of the calibration relationships , which allow us to pass from indices to abundances , and we show that the inferred trend of mg / fe with galactic mass is not so clear when interpreted in terms of real abundances , thus warning us from drawing any firm conclusion on galaxy formation processes just on the basis of the observed behavior of @xmath1 versus @xmath2 . indices .",
    "the reason for that resides partly in the large spread present in the observational data and partly in the fact that metallicity indices depend not only on the abundances of single elements but also on the ages and on the metallicity distribution ( tantalo et al .",
    "1998 ) of the different stellar populations present in elliptical galaxies .",
    "in section 2 we will discuss the chemical evolution model , in section 3 we will define the average abundances of a composite stellar population , in section 4 we will describe the model results and transform the predicted abundances into indices by means of the most recent metallicity calibrations . finally in section 5",
    "some conclusions will be drawn .",
    "the adopted model of galactic evolution is that outlined by matteucci and gibson ( 1995)(hereafter mg95 ) , where extensive descriptions and references can be found . the evolution of the abundances of several chemical species ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si and fe ) in the gas is followed , taking into account detailed nucleosynthesis from stars of all masses and sne of types ia , ib , and ii .",
    "we assume that ellipticals can be considered initially as homogeneous spheres of gas with luminous mass in the range @xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "a single zone interstellar medium ( ism ) with instantaneous mixing of gas is assumed throughout .",
    "the adopted age for all galaxy models is @xmath7 gyr .",
    "the fundamental equations can be written @xmath8{\\rm d}m } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( 1-a)\\int_{m_{\\rm bm}}^{m_{\\rm bm}}{\\psi(t-\\tau_{m})q_{mi}(t-\\tau_m)\\phi(m ) { \\rm d}m } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_{m_{\\rm bm}}^{m_{\\rm u}}{\\psi(t-\\tau_m)q_{mi}(t- \\tau_m)\\phi(m){\\rm d}m } , \\label{eq : evolution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the volume gas density in the form of an element _ i _ normalized to the initial total volume gas density .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 represents the abundance by mass of an element _ i _ and by definition the summation over all the elements present in the gas mixture is equal to unity .",
    "the various integrals in equation ( 1 ) represent the rates at which sne ( i and ii ) as well as single low and intermediate mass stars and single massive stars restore their processed and unprocessed material into the ism ( for a detailed description of the integrals see mg95 ; matteucci and greggio 1986 ) .",
    "we only remind here that the quantity @xmath11 represents the fraction of a star of mass @xmath12 which is restored in to the ism in the form of an element @xmath13 and therefore contains the nucleosynthesis prescriptions that we assume to be the same as in mg95 .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath14 is given by :    @xmath15    normalized to the initial total volume density .",
    "@xmath14 is assumed to drop to zero at the onset of the galactic wind .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is expressed in units of gyr@xmath17 and represents the efficiency of star formation , namely the inverse of the time scale of star formation .",
    "the values adopted here for @xmath18 are the same as in matteucci ( 1992 ) and arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) . in one case",
    "we have adopted the prescription for the * inverse wind model * of matteucci ( 1994 ) .",
    "the difference between the two cases is that in matteucci ( 1994 ) the * classic wind model * assumes that the efficiency of star formation decreases with increasing total galactic mass , as in arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) , whereas in the inverse wind model the efficiency of star formation increases as the total galactic mass increases ( similar in spirit to the sfr efficiency parametrization of tinsley and larson 1979 ) leading to a situation in which more massive galaxies experience a galactic wind before the less massive ones .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 represents the lifetime of a star of mass @xmath12 , and is taken from padovani and matteucci ( 1993 ) .      for gas to be expelled from a galaxy",
    "the following condition should be satisfied : the thermal energy of the gas heated by sn explosions should exceed the binding energy of the gas ( larson 1974 ) . at this point the gas present in the galaxy is swept away and the subsequent evolution is determined only by the amount of matter and energy which is restored to the ism by the dying stellar generations . in particular , only low mass stars contribute to this evolutionary phase and , among the sne , only sne of type ia ( those sne events whose progenitors have the longest lifetimes ) .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate the time for the onset of a galactic wind we need to know the energy input from sne and the binding energy of the gas as a function of time .",
    "the total thermal energy of the gas at time t , @xmath20 , and the binding energy of the gas in presence of a diffuse halo of dark matter are calculated as described in matteucci ( 1992 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath21 is calculated by assuming that @xmath22 of the initial blast wave energy is transferred into the ism as thermal energy by a sn remnant , if the time elapsed from the sn explosion is shorter than a sn remnant cooling time ( cox 1972 ) .",
    "the percentage of transferred energy then decreases as a power law in time @xmath23 for times larger than the cooling time .",
    "this is the same formulation used by arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) , matteucci and tornamb ( 1987 ) and mg95 with the exception that we consider a more realistic cooling time ( expressed in years ) which takes into account that the gas density is changing with time and that part of the interstellar gas is in the form of he : @xmath24^{-0.53}\\,\\ , years .",
    "\\label{eq : tc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    other formulations of the energy input from sne can be found in gibson ( 1997 ) and gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) .",
    "the energetic input from stellar winds in massive stars is ignored , since for normal ellipticals it is negligible compared to the sn thermal energy contribution , as shown by gibson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the galactic wind may last only for few @xmath25 years or continue until the present time depending crucially on the assumptions about the thermal energy of the gas and the potential energy of the gas .",
    "unfortunately , none of these quantities is well known .",
    "the time for the occurrence of the galactic wind , @xmath26 , either increases with the galactic mass as a consequence of the potential well incresing with galactic mass together with the efficiency of star formation decreasing with galactic mass ( classic wind model ) , or decreases with the galactic mass if the efficiency of star formation is strongly increasing with galactic mass ( inverse wind model ) , as can be seen in table 3 , as will be discussed in section 4 .",

    "1a represent the predictions of model i obtained by means of the calibrations described before and adopting the same [ mg / fe ] ratio as predicted by the models , as one can see in table 7 .",
    "the agreement with the observed trend is not so good , showing that the slope of the predicted relation is steeper than that shown by the data and that the predicted @xmath0 values do not cover the entire range in @xmath0 .",
    "this is mostly due to the assumed imf since model ii , which assumes a flatter imf , predicts values for @xmath0 which cover the whole range ( see fig .",
    "2a ) .    in fig .",
    "1b we show the predicted and observed mass - metallicity ( @xmath0 ) relationship .",
    "the data are from carollo et al .",
    "the best - fit to these data indicate @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the total galactic mass ( dark+luminous ) .",
    "the classic wind model recovers the slope of the @xmath0  mass relation , but with a zeropoint offset of @xmath109 with respect to the observed distribution .    on the other hand , the classic wind model with the arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) imf ( model",
    "ii ) , as shown in fig.2b , predicts a slope much steeper than the observed one , although it agrees better than model i with the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 relation shown in fig .",
    "it is worth noting that the arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) imf well reproduces the abundances in the intergalactic medium ( mg95 ; gibson 1997 ; gibson and matteucci 1997 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in figures 1a and 2a and in all the others we show also the relation between real abundances predicted by our models .",
    "the relation between @xmath70_{*}$ ] and @xmath69_{*}$ ] , arbitrarily translated in the plot of @xmath1 versus @xmath0 , is indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "this is done only with the purpose of comparing the slope of the relation between real abundances with that of the relation between indices and they are very similar , indicating that the adopted calibration does not modify the predicted relation between mg and fe abundances .",
    "one of the main reasons for that is the adopted calibration which accounts for the right @xmath3_{*}$ ] ratio for each galaxy .    in fig.3a",
    ", b we show the predictions of the inverse wind model of matteucci ( 1994 ) which predicts a stellar @xmath3_{*}$ ] increasing with galactic mass .",
    "the slope of the @xmath1 versus @xmath0 relation is in better agreement than in the previous models , and the slope of the @xmath0 vs. mass relation is also acceptable although the absolute values of the indices are too high .    in fig.4a , b we show the results of model iv with a variable imf from galaxy to galaxy , which also predicts increasing @xmath3_{*}$ ] ratios with galactic mass .",
    "the agreement with the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 data is marginally acceptable , but the slope of the mass - metallicity relation is too steep and the predicted absolute values of @xmath0 are too low .",
    "the low absolute values of @xmath0 are due to the fact that we used slopes steeper than the salpeter ( 1955 ) one for the less massive galaxies and such slopes are not suitable for elliptical galaxies ( see mg95 ) since they predict too low metallicities .",
    "however , other numerical experiments , where we used a variable imf but with flatter slopes for each galactic mass ( from x=1.4 in low mass galaxies to x=0.8 in high mass galaxies ) , have shown that there is a negligible difference in the predicted @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 relation while the mass - metallicity relation gets worse .    in fig.5a , b we show the predictions of model v calculated with the time - variable imf as suggested by padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and adapted to elliptical galaxies .",
    "the slope of this imf is decreasing with time thus favoring massive stars at early epochs . a similar although more complex formulation of the padoan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) imf has been recently adopted by chiosi et al .",
    "the model behaves like a classic wind model , in the sense that the galactic wind occurs first in small galaxies and later in the more massive ones .",
    "concerning the predicted indices , fig.5a shows that the @xmath0 decreases for massive objects , due to the fact that the imf in these galaxies is less biased towards massive stars than in smaller systems .",
    "this is , in turn , due to the fact that the slope of the imf is inversely proportional to the gas density which is lower in more massive objects .",
    "this model predicts a sort of bimodal behavior for the @xmath0 vs. mass relation and it does not fit the data better than the other models .    finally , in fig.6a , b the predictions of model vi are shown .",
    "at variance with all the previous models , model vi seems to reproduce well the observed slope of the @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 relation as well as the @xmath0- mass relation .",
    "the main problem with this model is the fact that the predicted ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are too narrow compared to the observations , especially the range of @xmath1 .",
    "another potential problem of this model is the predicted @xmath74 ratio which is @xmath110 for each galaxy mass .",
    "this is a high value for ellipticals unless one believes in a hubble constant @xmath111 , as discussed in padovani and matteucci ( 1993 ) .    in figs .",
    "7 and 8 we show the plot of the mass - metallicity ( @xmath0 ) relation as predicted by model i and model ii , obtained under different assumptions about the calibrating formula .",
    "as one can see , some of the calibrations give similar results such as those of worthey et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , casuso et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and buzzoni et al .",
    "these calibrations have in common the use of a solar ratio for [ mg / fe ] ( [ mg / fe]=0 ) . on the other hand , the values of the indices obtained by using the calibrations of barbuy ( 1994 ) and tantalo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which adopt non - solar ratios , differ from the others and between themselves .",
    "it is worth noting that the use of different calibrations may lead even to different slopes for the @xmath0-@xmath112 relationship .",
    "one criticism that could in principle be moved to the results discussed before is that we adopted mass - averaged metallicities and not luminosity - averaged metallicities , as it should be the case . in fig .",
    "9 we show the indices obtained by the luminosity- and mass - averaged metallicities calculated for the results of model ii , when the calibration of tantalo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is applied .",
    "the luminosity - averaged metallicities , computed with the photometric model of gibson ( 1997 ) , are systematically slightly lower than the others and the difference is larger for smaller galaxies , as expected",
    ". however , the slope is the same in the two cases , showing that the use of mass - averaged metallicity for this kind of analysis is quite justified .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the relation between metallicity indices , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and total mass in nuclei of ellipticals and its implications in terms of models of formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies .    in order to do that we have transformed the average abundance of fe in the composite stellar population of the galaxy , as predicted by different models of chemical evolution , into @xmath0 and @xmath1 indices by means of the available calibrations .",
    "we have shown the results of classic wind models for ellipticals , such as those discussed by arimoto and yoshii ( 1987 ) and matteucci and tornamb ( 1987 ) , as well as the results of models with variable imf from galaxy to galaxy and with galactic winds occurring first in the more massive systems , implying that these systems are older than the less massive ones .",
    "we have found that it is not possible to establish clearly which kind of model should be preferred , first of all because of the large spread present in the data .",
    "moreover , little difference is found in the predicted indices of models which predict a @xmath3_{*}$ ] either increasing or decreasing with galactic mass , although the data seem to suggest an increase of this ratio with galactic mass larger than predicted by any of the models .    on this basis",
    ", the classic wind model can not be considered worse than the other models .",
    "actually , the classic wind model with a flat constant imf seems to be the only one which can reproduce the whole range of the observed indices .",
    "however , if we isolate the data from gonzalez ( 1993 ) and do not consider the others , then in order to reproduce the flat slope of the @xmath1 versus @xmath0 relation , as given by the best - fit of the data , one should assume that fe among the nuclei of ellipticals is almost constant whereas mg increases from less massive to more massive nuclei .",
    "this is not achieved by any of the models presented here since it would require quite `` ad hoc '' assumptions especially concerning the type ia sne .    from the numerical experiments performed in this paper",
    "we can say that a model which explains at the same time the mass - metallicity and the iron - magnesium relation requires an inverse wind situation , with a strong increase of the star formation efficiency with galactic mass ( i.e. model vi ) , rather than a variable imf from galaxy to galaxy , and an imf with a slope @xmath113 . however , a model of this type is not able to reproduce the observed ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we have also calculated models where amount and concentration of dark matter increases , compatibly with the formulation of the potential energy of the gas , with decreasing galactic luminous mass ( see persic et al .",
    "1996 ) , with the net result of obtaining an `` inverse wind '' situation .",
    "the results are very similar to those of model iii .",
    "therefore , to obtain a better agreement with observations one should invoke also in this case an increase of the star formation efficiency with galactic mass .",
    "this would certainly flatten the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 relation but it would further shrink the ranges of the predicted indices .",
    "in fact , both an increasing star formation efficiency and a decreasing importance of dark matter with increasing luminous galactic mass can be viable solutions to achieve the situation of more massive ellipticals being older than less massive ones .    in conclusion",
    ", it is quite important to establish the value of [ mg / fe ] from the observational point of view since abundance ratios , such as [ mg / fe ] , represent an important diagnostic to infer ages in galaxies , due to the different timescales for the mg and fe production .",
    "generally , a high [ mg / fe ] is interpreted as a young age and the upper limit for the age is given by the time at which the chemical enrichment from type ia sne starts to become important .",
    "this timescale depends not only on the assumed progenitors of type ia sne but also on the star formation history of the galaxy considered ( see matteucci 1997 ) and for giant elliptical galaxies this timescale is of the order of @xmath114 years and in any case it can not be larger than 1 gyr also for smaller systems .",
    "this is at variance with what stated by kodama and arimoto ( 1997 ) who claim , on the basis of results concerning our galaxy ( yoshii et al .",
    "1996 ) , that this timescale is of the order of 1.5 - 2.5 gyr .",
    "this is indeed true for our galaxy where the star formation history has been quite different than in ellipticals and it had been already pointed out in greggio and renzini ( 1983b ) and in matteucci and greggio ( 1986 ) .",
    "this is a quite important point , both for the galactic chemical enrichment and for the predictions about sn rates at high redshift .",
    "therefore , an enhanced [ mg / fe ] indicates that the process of galaxy formation must have been very fast thus favoring a monolithic collapse scenario rather than a merging scenario . in this framework",
    ", a [ mg / fe ] ratio higher in more massive ellipticals than in less massive ones could be interpreted as due to their faster formation and evolution ( see matteucci 1994 ; bressan et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "an independent way of estimating the ages of ellipticals , where for ages we intend the time elapsed from the last star formation event , is to study the @xmath115 index .",
    "this index is , in fact , related to the age of the dominant stellar population , since it gives a measure of the turn - off color and metallicity .",
    "it can therefore be used to solve the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "bressan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , by analyzing the @xmath115 and other physical parameters in the sample of ellipticals observed by gonzalez ( 1993 ) , concluded that massive galaxies should have stopped forming stars before less massive ones , in agreement with the results of the inverse wind model discussed here .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that both models with a salpeter imf and a variable imf have a potential problem in reproducing high [ @xmath116/fe ] ratios in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , as shown by their low average @xmath117_*$ ] ratios ( see tables 7 - 12 ) .",
    "therefore , in agreement with mg95 and gibson and matteucci ( 1997 ) we conclude that a flat imf is required to explain the high [ @xmath116/fe ] ratios , as found by asca observations ( mushotzsky 1994 ) .",
