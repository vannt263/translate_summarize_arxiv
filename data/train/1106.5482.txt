    "a wide range of cosmological observations indicate that the universe has entered a phase of accelerating expansion , which becomes one of the important puzzles of the contemporary physics .",
    "those observations include the type ia supernovae ( snia ) standard candles @xcite , @xcite , the angular location of the first peak in the cmb power spectrum @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations of the matter density power spectrum @xcite .",
    "these evidences represent a great stimulus for theoretical work and originated the concept of dark energy .",
    "the dark energy ( de ) models attribute the observed accelerating expansion to an unknown energy component with negative pressure , which dominates the universe at recent cosmological times .",
    "the data can be accommodated with a high degree of accuracy , in the @xmath0cdm model which combines the baryons with conventional cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates and the cosmological constant @xmath0 , which accounts for the dark energy .",
    "however a non zero cosmological constant raises the coincidence problem ( why the dm and de are comparable today ) , and is plagued by fine tuning problems @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "alternatively , dark energy may be described by different dynamical scalar field models with time - dependent equation of state , like quintessence @xcite , @xcite ; string theory fundamental scalar known as tachyon @xcite ; k - essence models involving a generalized form of the kinetic energy @xcite,@xcite ; scalar field with negative kinetic term , which provides a solution known as phantom dark energy @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "an alternative description of de may be given by perfect fluids with adequate equation of state , like chaplygin gas @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned scalar field models assume that the dm and de are of different nature , while in the chaplygin gas the dm and de appear as manifestations of the same single fluid at different cosmological epochs , showing a dust - like matter behavior at early times and behaving as cosmological constant at late times @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ another description of de is provided by the scalar - tensor theories which contain a direct coupling of the scalar field to the curvature , with the advantage of giving a mechanism to evade the coincidence problem , and naturally allowing ( in some cases ) the crossing of the phantom barrier @xcite . these theories with different couplings to the curvature appear as low energy limit of several higher dimensional theories , and provide a possible approach to quantum gravity from a perturbative point of view @xcite .",
    "a coupling between curvature and kinetic terms appears as part of the weyl anomaly in @xmath1 conformal supergravity @xcite . a model with non - minimal derivative couplings",
    "was proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the context of inflationary cosmology , and recently , non - minimal derivative coupling of the higgs field was considered in @xcite , also as inflationary model . in @xcite a derivative coupling to ricci tensor has been considered to study cosmological restrictions on the coupling parameter , and the role of this coupling during inflation .",
    "some asymptotical solutions for a non - minimal kinetic coupling to scalar and ricci curvatures were found in @xcite , and quintessence and phantom cosmological scenarios with non - minimal derivative coupling have been studied in @xcite . a scalar field with kinetic term coupled to a product of einstein tensors has been considered in @xcite .",
    "non - minimal coupling of scalar fields ( including kinetic terms ) with modified @xmath2 theories have been also considered to solve the de problem in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we consider an explicit coupling between the scalar field the kinetic term and the curvature @xcite , as the source of de and will establish the connection with the chaplygin gas , by obtaining the solution of the field equations that reproduce the cosmological evolution as given by the perfect fluid obeying the equation of state of the chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas has attracted much attention in cosmology , as it allows to interpolate between a dust dominated phase of the evolution of the universe in the past , and an accelerated one at recent time .",
    "on the other hand , as in the case of the chaplygin gas , the scalar field with the non - minimal kinetic coupling to the curvature , has been shown to be successful in the description of the dm and de without introducing separately the dm term ( see @xcite ) , i.e. it describes the dm and de as manifestations of a common scalar field at different epochs .",
    "for this reason , it would be interesting to analyze the connection of the scalar field with non - minimal kinetic couplings with chaplygin gas , which will be the subject of study in the present paper .",
    "a potential and coupling function that may give a dynamical description to the chaplygin gas , have been found . the generalized and modified version of the chaplygin gas",
    "have been also considered .",
    "the scalar field with kinetic couplings to curvature is given by @xcite : [ eq1 ]    s=&d^4x .",

    ", the derived expressions for the density and pressure for the scalar field can be regarded as effective ones . from now on , and in order to simplify the equations ( the field equations will contain only second order derivatives ) we will use the restriction @xmath13 , which is equivalent to a coupling of the kinetic term to the einstein tensor @xmath14 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . evaluating the @xmath15 and @xmath16 components of the eq .",
