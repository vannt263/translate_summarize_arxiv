    "the idea of circular accretion , offering a potentially extremely efficient radiation source , became ubiquitous with the successful application of the @xcite model to active galactic nuclei and binary stellar systems .",
    "tdes have also been traditionally envisioned as involving circular accretion .",
    "however , recent tde candidate observations very rarely reproduce these high efficiencies , and recent detailed hydrodynamical studies of tdes have indicated that most of their matter may stay on highly eccentric orbits for longer than previously thought .",
    "these developments suggest the time has come to challenge circular accretion and examine alternative accretion pathways .",
    "the classical description of a tde was outlined by @xcite and @xcite . in this picture , immediately after the disruption half of the disrupted stellar debris remains bound and orbits the bh in highly eccentric streams . on their first return to the pericenter region , their orbits are quickly circularized by shocks due to relativistic apsidal precession .",
    "the mass fall - back rate @xmath5 translates into a similar lightcurve because the inflow time from the pericenter is short compared to the debris streams orbital period .",
    "based on this picture , a soft x - ray light curve comprising a bright peak followed by a @xmath3 decay has long been taken to be the hallmark of a tde , and a number of candidates have been found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following the identification of a considerably fainter , yet convincing , tde candidate in the optical and uv bands @xcite , optical observing campaigns have now detected significantly more tde candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than have been found in soft x - rays .    however , most properties of these tde candidates are difficult to explain within the classical picture .",
    "the observed luminosity and temperature are much lower and the emission radius is much larger than expected .",
    "additionally , a major difficulty is that the observed energy is significantly lower than the potential supply from accretion of a solar mass onto a smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , for typical parameters , for which the pericenter @xmath6 of the tidally disrupted star is @xmath7@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , even the energy needed to be dissipated to form a circular accretion disk at @xmath6 is much larger than observed .",
    "possible resolutions to this problem discussed in the literature include photon trapping @xcite , a kinetic outflow carrying away orbital energy @xcite , a low - mass outflow regulating the accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and radiation in an unobserved band such as the euv .",
    "however , whether by capturing the photons or limiting the accretion rate onto the bh , most of these models decouple the time - dependence of the luminosity from the fallback rate , and therefore lead to lightcurves different from the @xmath3 power - law to which the data are often fitted .    an additional problem has arisen from numerical hydrodynamics simulations of the mass return . even within the first half an orbit of the most tightly - bound material , shocks near the orbits apocenters begin to deflect the gas @xcite . following the flow for @xmath10 orbits of the most tightly - bound material , @xcite ( hereafter skcpn15 ) showed that , contrary to the expectation underlying the classical model , the returning matter does not quickly form an accretion disk around @xmath6 .",
    "the gas does shock when it returns to the pericenter region , but , as predicted @xcite , this shock is weak ; moreover , it lasts as a shock for only a few orbital periods of the most tightly - bound tidal debris .",
    "consequently , after passing through the near - pericenter region , the matter continues to follow a highly - eccentric orbit and returns to an apocenter similar to the original orbit s .",
    "freshly infalling matter collides with this returning matter and forms additional shocks near the apocenter .",
    "motivated by these findings , @xcite suggested that these outer shocks , rather than accretion onto the smbh , power the light output of tdes . in their model",
    ", the post - peak luminosity naturally decays @xmath5 because it is directly associated with mass fall - back , and the emerging radiation has the observed low luminosity , low temperature , and large radial scale .",
    "this model raises the question of the eventual fate of the matter .",
    "if it does eventually fall onto the smbh , why does it not radiate a large amount of energy ? here",
    ", we propose a new accretion model , in which a standard accretion disk never forms .",
    "instead , we analyze the dynamics of an intrinsically non - steady highly eccentric accretion flow .",
    "depending on the relative rates of energy and angular momentum loss , fluid on an elliptical trajectory may either circularize and form a standard accretion disk , or may enhance its eccentricity . in the latter case , upon losing sufficient angular momentum , fluid can cross the bh s effective potential barrier and plunge into the bh . in this case the orbital energy loss en route to the bh can be considerably smaller than the one associated with standard disk accretion .",
    "we show that under reasonable assumptions this scenario is likely , and it may explain why tde candidates are fainter than expected .",
    "the feasibility of stable elliptical accretion disks with constant or rising eccentricity following a tde was first discussed by @xcite , who suggested that elliptical disks may produce fainter tdes due to longer accretion time - scales .",
    "in contrast , we suggest here that tdes are fainter because matter falls with _ less _ , rather than _ slower _ , orbital energy loss .",
    "the result of a tidal disruption is to settle most of the matter bound to the bh into an eccentric flow whose mean eccentricity is somewhat smaller than the initial mean eccentricity of the tidal debris ( skcpn15 ) . in the simulation reported in that paper , the disk s mean eccentricity was @xmath11 , but it may often be larger because the initial eccentricity of the tidal debris scales with the ratio of bh mass to star mass , @xmath12 ; this ratio was only 500 in their simulation , whereas it is expected to be @xmath13 in typical tdes . to be precise , the mass - weighted eccentricity of the tidal streams should be @xmath14/[(m_{_{\\rm bh}}/m_*)^{1/3}+1]$ ] , which approaches unity as the mass ratio grows .",
    "the disk formed from the tidal debris therefore has approximately the same specific angular momentum as a circular disk at @xmath6 , but much higher energy .    in order to form a circular disk at @xmath6",
    ", the orbiting gas must lose @xmath15 .",
    "this energy alone is already an order of magnitude above that observed .",
    "if the debris are to reach the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) by following a succession of nearly circular orbits and fall onto the bh , their energy must drop further .",
    "however , circular accretion down to the isco is not an absolute requirement for matter to pass through the isco and on to the the event horizon : even unbound particles can pass through the event horizon if their trajectories are inward and have sufficiently small angular momentum ( see fig [ fig : accretion ] ) . in the context of an eccentric accretion disk , it is therefore of considerable interest to examine carefully whether gas streams reach such low angular momentum before or after their binding energies become comparable to the isco binding energy .     associated with",
    "the schwarzschild effective potential for three values of specific angular momentum .",
    "dashed lines with arrows indicate bounded orbital motions , solid lines indicate direct infall onto the black hole .",
    "the blue fluid element is on an elliptical trajectory and upon losing a small amount of angular momentum and almost no energy , it plunges into the black hole ( black solid line ) .",
    "the green fluid elements on circular orbits are trapped by the potential and can fall into the bh only after losing a significant amount of energy .",
    "the dotted line depicts their motion from one circular orbit to the other in a  standard \" circular accretion . ]    for a particle on a parabolic trajectory , i.e. , with a specific energy @xmath16 , the criterion for falling all the way to a schwarzschild black hole is @xmath17 ( see fig [ fig : accretion ] ) .",
    "quantitatively , a parabolic orbit with pericenter @xmath6 has a specific angular momentum @xmath18 substituting a fiducial @xmath19 , as expected in a tde of @xmath20 ( e.g. piran et al .",
    "2015 ) , yields @xmath21 .",
    "thus , such a fluid element must lose only @xmath22 of its angular momentum in order to cross the potential barrier of a nearly parabolic orbit .",
    "we now examine the possibility that the loss of @xmath22 of the angular momentum is accompanied by an orbital energy loss much smaller than the @xmath23 of rest - mass energy associated with circular accretion onto a schwarzschild bh .    as the tidal debris travels along its highly elliptical orbits",
    ", one might reasonably expect the now - familiar exponential growth of the magneto - rotational instability @xcite and its nonlinear development into anisotropic mhd turbulence . because the fastest - growing modes of the instability grow at a rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the _ local _ orbital shear @xcite",
    ", this growth might be rather different when both the orbital frequency and the shear vary drastically around the orbit , as they do in an eccentric disk , rather than remaining constant as in a conventional circular disk .",
    "we set aside this question to be answered later by numerical simulations . for the time being , we assume that the mhd turbulence does reach rapidly saturation with more or less the usual ratio of magnetic pressure to the local thermal pressure @xcite",
    ".    the rate at which a fluid element s angular momentum changes is given by the divergence of the angular momentum flux through that fluid element . in steady - state accretion disks , it is simplest to analyse the flow from an eulerian point of view , in which angular momentum and energy flow radially through the disk . thus , any divergence in flux is due entirely to radial gradients , and these apply to fluxes associated with both magnetic stresses and mass flow . in the case of eccentric accretion flows ,",
    "it is more convenient to think instead in terms of a lagrangian picture , following the orbital evolution of an individual fluid element .    in a circular accretion disk ,",
    "the dominant off - diagonal element of the maxwell stress tensor is the @xmath26-@xmath27 element , associated with conveying angular momentum in the radial direction .",
    "this is the only element with a non - zero long - term mean value ; both of the other two elements fluctuate symmetrically in sign . by contrast , in an eccentric disk the orbital velocity has both radial and azimuthal components and varies in a direction @xmath28 perpendicular to the local orbital tangent @xmath29 .",
    "we will therefore assume that the local maxwell stress tensor follows suit : its only interesting off - diagonal element is the @xmath28-@xmath29 element . to evaluate its magnitude",
    ", we will make two further assumptions : that @xmath30 is the usual @xmath11 @xcite ; and that the scale of the gradient in the @xmath28 direction is @xmath31 .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the rate of specific angular momentum loss is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface density .",
    "the factor @xmath34 is necessary to convert momentum in the @xmath29 direction into angular momentum . for most angles",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "however , for directions toward the apocenter it is generally @xmath37 because the orbital tangent at large distances is almost radial except for a very short stretch at the apocenter itself .",
    "the rate at which internal stresses turn orbital energy into heat is the rate of dissipation associated with the turbulence . in a time - steady circular disk",
    ", this rate is the rate of shear times the stress across the shear , i.e. , @xmath38 . in a non - steady elliptical flow ,",
    "this relation is unlikely to apply exactly , but we will adopt it as an order of magnitude estimate , i.e. , the heating rate per unit mass is @xmath39 with the important distinction that @xmath40 is the _ local _ orbital frequency , _ not _ @xmath41 the inverse of the orbital period .",
    "note that it does not matter whether the work takes the form of a torque changing rotational kinetic energy or a force changing translational kinetic energy , so the geometric factor @xmath42 is unnecessary .",
    "note , too , that dissipation of orbital energy into heat is not in itself a loss of energy ; energy is removed from the flow only when it actually leaves , whether in the form of escaping photons or escaping matter .",
    "if we freeze the torque at the value pertaining to a particular location @xmath43 in the orbit , the time required to reduce the initial angular momentum to its critical value , @xmath44 , is @xmath45(v_{\\rm circ}^2/v_a^2)(r / r_g)}{\\alpha_{\\rm mag}|\\hat r\\times\\hat t| } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath46 the circular orbital speed at radius @xmath47 and @xmath48 the local alfven speed .",
    "the factor @xmath49 should be interpreted as @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 for non - spinning bhs ; it is somewhat less for larger spin parameters .",
    "writing @xmath52 and approximating @xmath53 , the preceding expression can be rewritten as @xmath54(r_p / r_g)^{1/2}(r / r_g)r_g / c}{\\alpha_{\\rm mag}(v_a^2/v_{\\rm circ}^2)|\\hat r\\times\\hat t|},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the time associated with reducing the initial specific orbital energy to @xmath55 , the energy of a circular orbit at radius @xmath6 is @xmath56    skcpn15 found that the disk aspect ratio @xmath57 varies slowly as a function of radius because adiabatic compression of fluid elements as they move inward raises their temperature .",
    "the same compression also increases the flow s optical depth and lengthens its cooling time , enforcing adiabatic behavior .",
    "when @xmath57 is nearly constant , and the usual relations between magnetic intensity and internal pressure hold , @xmath58 should likewise change only weakly with radius .",
    "thus , both characteristic timescales are shortest near pericenter .    at any particular radius ,",
    "the ratio between these two times is @xmath59(r_p / r)^2 } { |\\hat r\\times\\hat t| } \\ .\\ ] ] the factor within square brackets is always order unity ; the geometric factor is @xmath60 near pericenter , but grows to @xmath61 toward apocenter .",
    "however , the final factor falls to @xmath62 near apocenter .",
    "consequently , the overall product is comparable to unity near pericenter , but decreases drastically at larger distance from the bh .",
    "thus , throughout the orbit , progress toward reaching the critical angular momentum is at least as fast as the effective rate of progress toward the circular - orbit binding energy and can be considerably faster .    to estimate how many orbits are required to reach either goal ,",
    "consider the product of @xmath63 or @xmath64 with @xmath65 : @xmath66 and @xmath67 the ratio between the angular momentum that is removed while traversing a radian of azimuthal angle and the angular momentum that must be lost in order to plunge to the bh is : @xmath68(j / r_gc)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the fraction of the binding energy for a circular orbit at @xmath6 that is added while traversing a radian is @xmath69    these two expressions may be approximately integrated over the entire orbit using @xmath70 and dividing the full range of azimuthal angle into three segments . for the roughly half of azimuthal angle near pericenter , @xmath71 to within a factor of 2 ; for angles within a radian of apocenter but not extremely close to the apocenter , @xmath72 ; for angles so close to apocenter that @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the total angular momentum loss over an orbit is dominated by the region very close to the apocenter , and its ratio to the amount necessary to fall into the bh is @xmath75(j / r_gc)(1-e)^{1/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the analogous fractional energy loss per orbit is dominated by radii near the pericenter : @xmath76    mhd simulations of fully - developed mri - driven turbulence find @xmath77 , while @xmath780.1 .",
    "the factor @xmath79 is typically several .",
    "combining these factors with @xmath80 , we expect that an order ten orbits are necessary to remove so much angular momentum that a stream can fall directly into the bh .",
    "the expression for the energy loss is very similar to that for angular momentum loss , except for @xmath81 which is balanced by @xmath82 $ ] , and @xmath83 which is not balanced .",
    "thus , the rate of progress toward losing enough angular momentum to be accreted is likely to be ten times faster than the rate at which the orbits evolve toward a semi - major axis @xmath84 .",
    "thus , much of the matter may reach the bh at a time when its orbital energy has been reduced by only a fraction of the binding energy at @xmath6 , which is in turn , for our fiducial @xmath85 , three times smaller than the binding energy of an orbit near the isco , amounting to an efficiency @xmath4 of the classical one .",
    "this efficiency also holds for non - fiducial cases : if @xmath86 , e.g. for @xmath87 , the lower @xmath88 is balanced by @xmath89\\rightarrow0 $ ] . for @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath89\\rightarrow1 $ ] is balanced by a higher @xmath88 .",
    "our estimate also applies to kerr bh , since even an atypical equatorial plane tde by an @xmath91 kerr bh , implying @xmath82\\rightarrow1 $ ] , changes our estimate by at most a factor @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , the cooling time near the pericenter , where the material is hottest , is so long compared to the time spent there that loss of the dissipated heat before the fluid falls into the bh is further suppressed .",
    "this is because the laminar orbital flow in a highly eccentric disk with constant @xmath57 causes the density to scale @xmath93 so that @xmath94 , while , as shown by @xcite , the cooling time is comparable to the orbital frequency at the apocenter .",
    "there are , however , two assumptions in this argument that might be questioned .",
    "the first is that @xmath95 remains approximately constant around the orbit , i.e. that @xmath48 falls with radius @xmath96 .",
    "if it were to fall with radius at least as rapidly as @xmath97 , angular momentum loss would be dominated by the pericenter rather than the apocenter region ; energy loss would remain dominated by the pericenter . in this case , the efficiency of accretion from a highly eccentric stream is limited to @xmath98 , which is always less than the classical radiative efficiency of time - steady nearly - circular flow through the isco . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath48 were to fall with radius more slowly than @xmath96 , angular momentum loss would become even more dominated by the apocenter region , but provided @xmath99 with @xmath100 , energy loss would continue to be primarily near the pericenter . in this case",
    ", the rate of angular momentum loss would remain much higher than the rate of energy loss .",
    "the other assumption requiring closer examination is that the dissipation rate by the pericenter  nozzle shock \" is , at most , comparable to the dissipation rate in the outer shocks , as shown by skcpn15 . at larger mass ratios than that treated by skcpn15 ( they took @xmath101 ;",
    "in typical tdes , this ratio may be @xmath13 or more ) , the ratio of the potential depth at the nozzle shock to that in the outer shock region increases @xmath102 , perhaps leading to greater dissipation in the inner shock .",
    "however , skcpn15 also found that the mach number of the nozzle shock is never very large , and the convergence angle of the streams at the nozzle becomes even shallower with larger mass ratios , potentially weakening or even eliminating the nozzle shock .",
    "thus , the question of how the nozzle shock s dissipation rate scales with mass ratio will also require additional simulations to settle .",
    "if hydrodynamical shocks fail to promptly circularize the bound debris streams that result from a tde by a smbh , as suggested by skcpn15 , then the debris flow evolution is controlled by some combination of magnetic stress and shocks in the apocenter region .",
    "we have shown that reasonable estimates of the rates of angular momentum loss and energy loss due to mhd effects lead to the conclusion that angular momentum is lost sufficiently rapidly to cause streams to plunge into the smbh directly from a highly eccentric orbit , losing only a small fraction of their orbital energy .",
    "the actual energy dissipated , of which only a part may be radiated , is typically equivalent to @xmath4 of the expected loss in a classical black hole accretion disk , @xmath103 . in view of the various approximations taken , in both the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics , reducing the quantitative uncertainty involved in these estimates",
    "will require considerably more detailed analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "the low efficiency of highly - eccentric accretion offers a natural explanation for the comparatively small radiation fluence observed from most tde candidates .",
    "although these estimates were motivated by tdes , this result may also be applicable to other systems whenever highly eccentric flows arise ."
