    "the space / time noncommutativity that arises on d - branes in the presence of a near critical ` electric ' neveu - schwarz potential has produced some interesting surprises .",
    "in particular on a d3 brane after taking a certain limit , one is left with a new noncommutative open string theory ( ncos ) that is decoupled from closed strings @xcite .",
    "one natural question is to determine the m  theory origin of these ncos .",
    "the five  brane plays the role of the d - brane and the open membrane plays the role of the string .",
    "the background three form @xmath0 then plays the role of the ns two form .",
    "this has motivated the investigation of the five  brane theory in the background of a non trivial @xmath0 field @xcite .",
    "a decoupling limit for the five  brane that is the m  theory origin of the ncos limit was given in @xcite .",
    "this theory has near critical field strength and is believed to be associated with an open membrane theory in six dimensions .",
    "previously , the dual supergravity descriptions of different brane theories have been investigated in several contexts , for a review see @xcite .",
    "in particular the soliton that interpolates between two different susy vacua has been interpreted as providing a description of the the flow between the corresponding decoupled brane theories @xcite .",
    "this has recently been discussed for the ncos in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will examine some aspects of the supergravity dual of the five  brane theory .",
    "in particular we identify the solution to eleven dimensional supergravity that is dual to the five  brane theory at critical field strength and also describes the flow from the conformal ( 2,0 ) theory to the noncommutative five brane ( om ) theory .",
    "this solution has been analysed previously in @xcite .",
    "we will also describe the appropriate critical decoupling limit for the noncommutative five  brane ( om ) theory from the supergravity point of view as an asymptotic flow .",
    "there is one important consideration that need to be adressed when determing the limits that one may take on the five  brane .",
    "the adapted field strength @xmath1 must obey the following nonlinear self  duality constraint @xcite ,    _",
    "h _  , [ nlsd ]    where g is the determinant of the induced spacetime metric @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the scalar @xmath4 and the tensor @xmath5 are given by    @xmath6    this presents a small puzzle ; why should the bulk supergravity three form potential obey such a self  duality constraint ? here",
    "we will analyse the five  brane supergravity solution described in @xcite and demonstrate how this solution leads to the non  linear self  duality of @xmath0 pulled back to the five  brane and also how one may describe the critical field limit , crucial to the ncos construction , from the point of view of the five  brane sugra solution .",
    "we will also examine the five  brane directly in six dimensions from the open membrane point of view .",
    "a solution to the open membrane equations of motion in the background of near critical field strength is presented that is the natural lift of the string solution given in @xcite .",
    "the properties of this solution are in accordance with the physical picture of the critical field limit where the tension of the membrane cancels the force excerted due to the charged membrane boundary .",
    "this solution describes how the membrane becomes absorbed into the five  brane worldvolume which is also in agreement with the dual supergravity solution .",
    "related ideas concerning the noncommutaive five  brane ( om ) theory and ncos can be found in @xcite .",

    "this metric ( [ am ] ) had also been investigated in the context of seven dimensional domain wall supergravity with 16 unbroken supersymmetries @xcite . the fact it is the smeared membrane metric that appears in the world volume of the five ",
    "brane is consistent with the om interpretation of the critical field limit @xcite , see the discussion below .",
    "we next determine the three form potential that is induced on the five  brane worldvolume .",

    "thus the vacuum at @xmath22 has a non  trivial three ",

    "we see this occurs in the asymptotic region when @xmath42 .",
    "hence this justifies our identification of the @xmath23 case with the critical field strength limit .",
    "it is important notice that the non  linear nature of the five  brane self ",
    "duality is crucial for the critical limit .",
    "( linear self  duality would not allow a critical limit . )",
    "we now wish to describe a decoupling limit , i.e. a limit whereby @xmath43 , which has an asymptotic region with five  brane metric and field strength scaling as described in @xcite .",
    "the decoupling limit must obey the criteria that the line element @xmath44 and the four  form field strength @xmath45 are held fixed ( such that the supergravity action is finite for this background ; by making @xmath21 large the curvature becomes small and the supergravity approximation makes sense ) .",

    "the five  brane with non - trivial c in a decoupling limit has also been considered in @xcite and indeed the line element ( [ dsf ] ) was found .",

    "^-1 , _ a b c ^0 , g_^0 , g_ab ^1 .",
    "one important property of this limit is that the open membrane metric described in @xcite is fixed in units of @xmath52 .    in summary",
    ", the solution ( [ ds2])-([vol ] ) interpolates between a stack of five  branes at @xmath53 with zero field strength and a stack of five  branes at @xmath22 with non  vanishing field strength @xmath54 given by ( [ fs ] ) .",
    "the solution is fixed in the limit given by @xmath55 and ( [ tilde ] ) , which flows to a decoupled six  dimensional noncommutative five  brane ( om ) theory .",
    "it is worth remarking that such a limit is only possible at critical field strength . in the non - critical case , @xmath56",
    ", one can not obtain a brane decoupled from the bulk theory .",
    "this is consistent with how the ncos limit requires critical field strength to decouple the bulk modes .",
    "we may interpret the source of the constant field strength at @xmath22 as an array of self  dual strings stretched along the boundary of the space in the @xmath25 direction and smeared homogeneously in the @xmath26directions .",
    "these self  dual strings are boundaries of open membranes . in the critical limit , given by @xmath57 ,",
    "the open membranes become dissolved into the five  brane .",
    "this is exactly analogous to how open strings behave in d3 brane with the critical field strength @xcite .",
    "we will now illustrate this by analysing the solutions of the membrane field equations in the background provided by a five  brane with critical field strength .",
    "the membrane is described by the following equations of motion , constraints and boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "we shall choose the normal derivative at the boundary to be given by @xmath63 .    in order to find a solution we make an ansatz where the open membrane is infinitely stretched in the @xmath64 direction as follows    x^0=x^0 ( , )  , x^1=x^1 ( , )  , x^2=_p  , x^=constant  , = 3, ... ,9,11  .",
    "this results in the equations :    ^-x^=0  , ( ^0)^2+(x^0)^2 & = & ( ^1)^2+(x^1)^2  , + ^0x^0=^1 x^1  , x^=h^  , h  .    these equations are equivalent to the equations of an open string in an electric field @xmath65 .    in case @xmath66 the general solution",
    "is given by    x^0=x^1= a_g(h )  ,    where @xmath48 is a fixed length and @xmath67 a real constant . in the case",
    "@xmath68 , however , there are new critical solutions appearing .",
    "the solution for @xmath68 is given by    x^0=_g(a+b )  , x^1=_g(b+a )  .",
    "thus we have a static , non - degenerate open membrane solution given by    x^0=_g , x^1=_g  , x^2=_g  , x^=constant  , = 3, ... ,9,11  .",
    "notice that in the limit @xmath55 we have carried out a reparametrisation of @xmath69 .",
    "clearly this does not affect the geometry of the solution .",
    "the length scale @xmath48 for this solution is the scale introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is the effective tension of the open membrane inside the five  brane and is related to the five  brane field strength by @xmath70 .",
    "thus the solution describes a membrane stretched out inside the five  brane in the @xmath71 directions .",
    "this is what one expects from the dissolved membrane interpretation of the five  brane supergravity solution given by ( [ am ] ) .",
    "physically , one sees that the membrane tension ( which is scaled to @xmath72 ) is cancelled by the scaling of the electric field so that the membrane retains a finite length scale .",
    "this is reminiscent of the zero force condition experienced by bps solutions",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the cancellation properties persist ( as they do for bps solutions ) beyond the classical level .",
    "an obvious application would be to investigate the thermal properties of the noncommutative ( om ) theory by analysing the non extremal version of the smeared membrane metric ( [ am ] ) .",
