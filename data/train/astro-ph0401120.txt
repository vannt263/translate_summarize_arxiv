    "the periods of all known @xmath1-ray pulsars were originally discovered at lower energy wavelengths .",
    "although it has been shown that pulsations could have been discovered from the crab , vela , and geminga pulsars from just the @xmath0 data without a priori knowledge of their pulse periods ( jones 1999 ) , all detections of @xmath1-ray pulsations were achieved by folding the data given an x - ray or radio ephemeris . while there is the hope that blind searches of @xmath2 and @xmath3 data may result in some pulsar detections , the tendency of energetic young pulsars to glitch and have timing noise and the planned default scanning mode of the @xmath3 mission will greatly complicate such searches .",
    "current radio or x - ray ephemerides and precise positions allow any amount of data to be folded coherently without having to search through @xmath4 space .",
    "they also make unnecessary the restriction of searches to observations of a few months or less due to the large effective @xmath5 from timing noise and worries about glitches .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to detect potential @xmath1-ray pulsars before the next generation of high energy @xmath1-ray missions are launched .",
    "the @xmath0 mission has left us a legacy of unidentified galactic @xmath1-ray sources at low and mid - galactic latitudes , many of which will undoubtably turn out to be pulsars . in recent years , several new young pulsars have been found coincident with unidentified @xmath0 sources . some of these , such as the 69  ms psr j1420@xmath66048 in the kookaburra ( damico et al .",
    "2001 ) , were discovered in the parkes multibeam survey ( kramer et al .",
    ". however , many young radio pulsars are too faint to be detected in general surveys .",
    "fortunately , young pulsars often reveal themselves as x - ray point sources or through the x - ray or radio emission of an associated wind nebula .",
    "in fact , about a third of the known pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) are associated with known @xmath1-ray pulsars or are coincident with unidentified @xmath0 sources .",
    "an unidentified @xmath1-ray source can serve as a guide to lower energy searches , with the classic case being the discovery of the geminga pulsar through its x - ray emission ( halpern and holt , 1992 ) .",
    "in general , a strategy of hard ( @xmath7 kev ) x - ray imaging of a @xmath1-ray error box followed by radio imaging and deep radio pulse searches has proven successful . this method has resulted in the discovery of at least six pulsar wind nebula , three of which contain radio pulsars which were discovered subsequently ( halpern et al .",
    "2001 , roberts et al . 1999 ,",
    "roberts et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the case of psr j2021 + 3651 is an illustrative example .",
    "cos b first detected a high - energy @xmath1-ray source in this part of the cygnus region .",
    "shallow radio pulse searches ( nice and sayer 1997 ) , soft x - ray imaging and hard x - ray imaging using an early @xmath0 position failed to discover any sources of note ( mukherjee et al .",
    "2000 ) . a 2 - 10 kev @xmath8 image based on a revised position derived from @xmath9 gev @xmath0 data discovered the compact hard x - ray source ax j2021 + 3651 .",
    "the x - ray localization allowed a deep search for radio pulsations using the arecibo telescope , resulting in the discovery of the young , energetic ( but radio faint @xmath10  mjy ) 104  ms pulsar psr j2021 + 3651 ( roberts et al .",
    "a follow up chandra observation showed this to be embedded in a compact x - ray pulsar wind nebula with the standard torus and jet morphology ( hessels et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "imaging of these type of nebulae may be important for constraining models of high - energy emission .",
    "the orientation of the x - ray jets , presumably aligned with the pulsar s spin axis , and that of the torus , presumably aligned with the equator , tell us the viewing angle ( ng and romani 2003 ) .",
    "combined with the polarization sweep ( radhakrishnan and cooke 1969 ) and possibly the pulse morphhology , the magnetic inclination angle can also be strongly constrained . since models of high - energy pulsed emission generally depend on only the spin rate , magnetic field , and pulsar geometry , these observations should allow theorists to predict what @xmath2 and @xmath3 should see from these newly discovered pulsars .",
    "* energetic pulsars recently discovered in @xmath0 error boxes *    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "both large scale radio surveys and deep radio searches targeting x - ray sources have resulted in the discovery of interesting new pulsars coincident with unidentified @xmath0 sources .",
    "x - ray and radio imaging of @xmath0 error boxes has also revealed the presence of energetic new pulsars through the emission of associated wind nebulae .",
    "radio pulse searches of other x - ray sources and ultra - deep observations of the currently known pwn are planned or underway .",
    "we have also begun a northern extension of our mid - latitude survey using the gmrt .",
    "the goal is to discover and start timing as many potential @xmath1-ray pulsars as possible before the launch of @xmath2 .",
    "we also hope to obtain deep , high resolution images of pwn to determine accurate morphologies which can constrain pulsar geometry allowing case by case predictions of what will be seen with the next generation of @xmath1-ray satellites .",
    "besides detecting pulsations , goals for @xmath2 include confirming @xmath1-ray variability and possibly correlating it with x - ray variations .",
    "in addition , every effort should be made to constrain the mid - latitude source error boxes to be within the field of view of imaging x - ray satellites .",
    "this will allow counterpart searches to commence before or concurrent with the launch of @xmath3 ."
