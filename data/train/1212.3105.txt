    "the processes is interesting from an educational point of view , since the calculation of the cross section and the width involves only loops and does not contain diagrams of the tree - level and bremsstrahlung , and also exploits the multi - channel approach . the work is done in the framework of the 4-bosons processes sector extension in the sanc system  @xcite .    in section [ sec2 ]",

    "in the sanc system the basic concept of the analytical calculations is precomputation of vacuum building blocks , namely diagrams , in which all external particles are considered to be incoming and not lying on the mass shell .",
