    "since the discovery of the higgs boson was announced in the summer of 2012 , the lhc measurements of its properties have so far been supporting the standard model ( sm ) predictions  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the sm respects the charge - conjugation and parity ( cp ) symmetry and the higgs boson should be cp even .",
    "therefore if an admixture of the cp odd component is observed , it will be a direct evidence of cp violation in the higgs sector and thus physics beyond the sm .",
    "+ from the analyses on the tree level matrix elements , it has been shown that the azimuthal angle difference between the two partons ( gluon , quarks or antiquarks ) produced in association with the higgs boson produced by gluon fusion is very sensitive to the cp property of the higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "several analyses including effects of higher order corrections show that the correlation between the two partons found at the tree level matrix elements can be observed as a correlation between the two hardest _ jets _ despite smearing , see e.g. refs .",
    "however the attempts to observe the cp odd admixture precisely in this approach are expected to be difficult due to large theoretical uncertainties in monte carlo event simulation , particularly in our use of a parton shower generator which can simulate the qcd radiation only in the soft and/or collinear limit .",
    "+ it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the two partons produced in association with a top quark pair has a large azimuthal angle correlation near the threshold @xmath3 and the correlation is similar to that of the two partons produced together with the cp odd higgs boson via gluon fusion .",
    "the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite is that experimental techniques to measure such an angular correlation between jets can be established first by using these sm processes which have large cross sections .",
    "more precisely , we measure the azimuthal angle difference between two jets produced in association with a top quark pair and tune a monte carlo event generator to reproduce the data quantitatively . if an event generator tuned in this way is used , the theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the azimuthal angle correlation between two jets produced in association with the higgs boson can be reduced significantly .",
    "this will help achieve accurate measurements of the cp property of the higgs boson .",
    "+ in the present paper we attempt to create a bridge between the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite and actual experimental measurements , by studying our present capability and limitation of simulating the top quark pair plus multi - jet production process , so that experimentalists can use the real data to improve our simulation tools to be used to probe more fundamental physics such as the cp property of the higgs boson .",
    "the simplest method to include leading higher order corrections to the top quark pair production is to apply a parton shower generator to the exclusive top quark pair events , where the parton shower scale evolution of the top quark pair events produces the top quark pair plus multi - jet events at a hadronization scale .",
    "the event samples generated in this way are expected to reproduce qualitatively the multi - jet event rates and the jet @xmath4 and rapidity distribution , since the successive emission of parton showers follows the qcd prediction in the soft and/or collinear region and the overall jet rates have been fitted to the data in @xmath5 and hadronic collisions .",
    "those events , however , do not have correct correlations among jets since a parton shower generator emits azimuthally symmetric radiation about a parent momentum direction . to reproduce azimuthal angle correlations between two jets , at least the @xmath1 partons matrix elements have to be embedded . in order to consistently combine the event samples for different parton multiplicity generated by tree level matrix elements with parton showers ,",
    "a tree level merging algorithm is required .",
    "there exists several tree level merging algorithms proposed in literatures , including the ckkw  @xcite , the ckkw - l  @xcite , the gks  @xcite , the mlm  @xcite , the pseudo shower  @xcite and the shower @xmath6  @xcite algorithms .",
    "comparisons between these different algorithms have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "our objective in the present paper is to implement tree level merging algorithms and study theoretical issues on predicting the azimuthal angle correlation between the two hardest jets .",
    "+ we generate the event samples for the top quark pair production at the 14 tev lhc , by merging the tree level matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 2 or 3 partons with the parton shower model in pythia8 . by using the generated event samples ,",
    "the azimuthal angle difference between the two hardest jets ( i.e. the two highest transverse momentum jets ) , @xmath7 , is studied . + as tree level merging algorithms , the ckkw - l merging algorithm  @xcite and a new tree level merging algorithm are implemented .",
    "our new algorithm differs from the ckkw - l algorithm in the strategy for phase space separation .",
    "it is designed so that the contribution from the @xmath8 parton matrix elements to the event samples with two or more jets , which we call the contamination , can be more suppressed above the merging scale .",
    "therefore , more accurate predictions on correlations between two jets are expected .",
    "we confirm this by numerically comparing the two algorithms .",
    "the contamination is studied by varying a relation between the merging scale and the scale of a jet definition .",
    "we find that the contamination is not negligible when the merging scale is set equal to or slightly smaller than the scale of the anti-@xmath9 jet definition .",
    "+ we produce the @xmath10 distribution by using the generated event samples .",
    "the distribution shows a strong correlation in @xmath10 , as predicted in the previous analysis  @xcite based on the @xmath1 partons tree level matrix elements .",
    "this observation confirms that the correlation found in the @xmath1 partons tree level matrix elements  @xcite is still visible after including the dominant qcd higher order corrections and thus can be observed in the experiments .",
    "+ we observe a clear difference in the @xmath10 distribution between the event samples generated by merging the matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 2 partons and those generated by merging the matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 3 partons .",
    "furthermore , the difference is found slightly larger , when the rapidity range for jets is more restricted .",
    "we study the effects of the @xmath2 partons matrix elements on the correlation in detail and find out the origins of the difference .",
    "we show that the @xmath2 partons matrix elements play important roles in predicting @xmath10 accurately .",
    "+ we present a method for merging the matrix element event samples which include a @xmath0 decay as a part of the hard process with the parton shower . in this method ,",

    "+ we find a clear difference in the @xmath10 distribution between the event samples generated by merging the tree level matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 2 partons and those generated by merging the tree level matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 3 partons .",
    "furthermore , the difference is found slightly larger , when the rapidity range for jets is more restricted .",
    "we have studied the origins of the difference , or in other words the effects of the @xmath2 partons matrix elements on @xmath10 . when the matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 2 partons are merged , a non - negligible fraction ( @xmath287 ) of the correlation between the two hardest jets",
    "can be lost because a jet originating from hard parton showers can have a higher @xmath4 than one of the two jets originating from the two hard partons of the @xmath1 partons matrix elements . when the rapidity range for jets is more restricted , a further loss of the correlation arises because one of the two hard jets can be removed by the rapidity cut .",
    "when the matrix elements for the @xmath0 plus up to 3 partons are merged , the loss of the correlation due to the above two reasons can be avoided as follows . at first , jets originating from hard parton showers can not have higher @xmath4 than two of the three jets originating from the three hard partons of the @xmath2 partons matrix elements .",
    "second , even though one of the three hard jets is removed by the rapidity cut , there are still two jets which correctly predict the correlation .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that , the @xmath2 partons matrix elements play important roles in predicting @xmath10 accurately , since they effectively reduce the loss of the correlation .",
    "they can be more important as the rapidity cut on jets is set more stringent .",
    "+ we present a method for merging the matrix element event samples which include a @xmath0 decay as a part of the hard process with the parton shower .",
    "the effect of the @xmath0 dilepton decay on @xmath10 is studied .",
    "we have shown that the effect is small when the two hardest jets for @xmath10 are picked up from all jets not including the two hardest b jets .",
    "+ we note that our findings should be applicable equally to other heavy particle production processes by gluon fusion .",
    "we hope that our findings help experimentalists perform the proposal of ref .",
