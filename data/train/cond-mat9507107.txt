    "the question of interacting particles in a random potential has recently got a great deal of attention ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "indeed this problem is important for the understanding of conduction of electrons in metals and disordered systems .",
    "it is also very interesting from the theoretical view point since it allows to understand the effects of interaction on anderson localization .",
    "it is a common belief that in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems near the ground state , a repulsive interaction between particles leads to a stronger localization if compared with non interacting case @xcite .",
    "even if more complicate , the 2dimensional ( 2d ) problem is assumed to be localized , while in the 3dimensional ( 3d ) case delocalization can take place in the presence of interaction @xcite .",
    "however this problem is rather difficult for analytical , experimental and numerical investigations and therefore it is quite far from its final resolution .",
    "the complicated nature of the above problem can be illustrated by the example of only two interacting particles ( tip ) in a random potential .",
    "indeed in this case , contrary to the common lore , even repulsive particles can create an effective pair which is able to propagate on a distance @xmath2 much larger than its own size of the order of one particle localization length @xmath3 @xcite . from one side interference effects for non ",
    "interacting particles force the particles to stay together at a distance @xmath4 even in the repulsive case .",
    "but the relative motion between the two particles leads to the destruction of such interference and allows their coherent propagation on a distance @xmath5 .",
    "more explicitly , according to @xcite , in the quasi 1d case with @xmath6 transverse channels one has @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the strength of on site interaction and @xmath9 is the one particle hopping matrix element . here",
    "the inter - site distance is @xmath10 and the wave vector @xmath11 . since @xmath12 , then @xmath13 . in 2d",
    "the effective number of channels due to 2d localization is @xmath14 so that @xmath15 and localization is preserved ( here and everywhere @xmath3 represents the one  particle localization length in any dimension ) .",
    "the sharp increase of @xmath2 with the number of transverse channels @xmath6 leads to a straightforward possibility of delocalization for a pair of particles in 3d while one particle remains localized @xcite . in this sense",
    "the 3d case is much more interesting due to the possibility of delocalization and we qualitatively discuss it below .",
    "one of the interesting features of pair delocalization in 3d is that it is not due to a simple shift of the mobility edge produced by the interaction ( such possibility is indeed not so interesting ) .",
    "in fact , it is possible to consider a system in which _ all _ one - particle eigenstates are localized for _ all _ energies .",
    "this can be for example the 3d lloyd model with diagonal disorder @xmath16 and hopping @xmath9 on a cubic lattice , where @xmath17 are random phases homogeneously distributed in the interval @xmath18 $ ] . in this model _ all _ one - particle eigenstates are localized for @xmath19 .",
    "however , two repulsive particles with on - site interaction @xmath8 can create a coupled state which is delocalized and propagates through the lattice .",
    "indeed , a pair `` feels '' only smoothed potential @xcite that corresponds to an effective renormalization of the hopping matrix element @xmath20 which is strongly enhanced due to interaction and becomes larger than @xmath21 .",
    "of course , the enhancement takes place only for sufficiently large one - particle localization length @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the hopping @xmath23 should be not far from @xmath21 although there is , a priori , no requirement for @xmath9 to be very close ( parametrically ) to @xmath21 .",
    "the two particles delocalization due to interaction takes place only for states in which particles are on a distance @xmath24 from each other while for @xmath25 eigenstates are localized .",
    "such kind of situation is quite unusual since it means that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the schrdinger operator , corresponding to the delocalized pair , is _ embedded _ into the pure point spectrum of localized almost noninteracting particles states . for @xmath25",
    "the interaction between the two particles is exponentially small and this implies a very small coupling between the states corresponding to these two kinds of spectra .",
    "however , due to the quasi degeneracy of levels , even a small coupling can lead to important modifications of the above picture as it was discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , a direct numerical investigation of interaction - assisted delocalization in 3d is highly desirable .",
    "while the recent theoretical arguments and numerical simulations in quasi1d case @xcite - @xcite definitly demostrate the existence of enhancement for @xmath2 no numerical simulations have been done in 3d case .",
    "indeed , in 3d basis grows as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of 1d unperturbed one - particle states , and that leads to heavy numerical problems .    a similar type of interaction - assisted delocalization can be also realized in the kicked rotator model ( krm ) @xcite in 3d . in this case",
    "the unitary evolution operator takes the place of schrdinger operator and eigenenergies are replaced by quasi - energies .",
    "the advantage of such models is due to the independence of localization length on quasi - energy so that all one - particle states in 3d are localized for @xmath23 and delocalized for @xmath28 .",
    "even if very efficient , numerical simulations for krm in 3d become very difficult ; for two particles situation becomes even worse due to @xmath26 basis growth .",
    "one of the ways to overcome these numerical difficulties is the following . for 1d krm the number of dimensions can be effectively modelled by introducing a frequency modulation of the perturbation parameter @xcite .",
    "the case with @xmath29 incommensurate frequencies in the kick modulation corresponds to an effective solid state model with dimension @xmath30 . for @xmath31 , the effective dimension @xmath32 and anderson transition",
    "can be efficiently investigated @xcite .",
    "a similar approach can be done for two interacting particles and it allows to gain a factor @xmath33 in numerical simulations .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the model of two interacting kicked rotators ( kr ) studied in @xcite , @xcite with frequency modulation and @xmath34 .",
    "the quantum dynamics is described by the evolution operator  : @xmath35 \\ } \\\\",
    "\\times \\exp \\{-i [ v(\\theta , t ) + v(\\theta',t ) ] \\ } \\end{array } \\label{qmap}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is a random function of @xmath38 in the interval @xmath39 $ ] and it describes the unperturbed spectrum of rotational phases .",
    "the perturbation @xmath9 gives the coupling between the unperturbed levels and has the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in the case of two modulational frequencies ( @xmath42 ) , as in @xcite , we choose frequencies @xmath43 to be incommensurate with each other and with the frequency @xmath44 of the kicks .",
    "following @xcite we take @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 the real root of the cubic equation @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 we used the same @xmath43 and @xmath50 .",
    "we also studied another case of functional dependence of @xmath51 analogous to @xcite and corresponding to the lloyd model .",
    "all computations have been done for symmetric configurations . according to the theoretical arguments @xcite and numerical simulations",
    "@xcite the antisymmetric configurations corresponding to fermions with nearby site interaction should show a similar type of behaviour .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the model and present the main results for @xmath31 .",
    "the case of @xmath49 is discussed in section iii .",
    "the kicked rotator model corresponding to the 3d lloyd model is studied in section iv .",
    "conclusions and discussions of results are presented in section v.",
    "before to discuss the effects of interaction let us first discuss the noninteracting case @xmath52 . here",
    "the evolution operator can be presented as a product of two operators @xmath53 describing the independent propagation of each particle : @xmath54 since @xmath9 depends on time in a quasiperiodic way with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , one can go to the extended phase space @xcite , @xcite with effective dimension @xmath32 . in this space",
    "the operator is independent on time and has the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 . due to linearity in @xmath59",
    "the transformation from ( [ qmap1 ] ) to ( [ exsp1 ] ) is exact .",
    "however , the numerical simulations of ( [ qmap1 ] ) are @xmath60 times more effective than for ( [ exsp1 ] ) .",
    "the system ( [ exsp1 ] ) corresponds to an effective 3d model .",
    "numerical simulations in @xcite showed that the variation of coupling amplitude @xmath9 gives the transition from localized to diffusive regime as in usual anderson transition in @xmath61 . in @xcite the form of the kick @xmath9 had been chosen as @xmath62 \\end{array } \\label{ll}\\ ] ] in this case after a mapping similar to the one used in @xcite the equation for eigenfunction with a quasi - energy @xmath63 can be presented in a usual solid - state form : @xmath64 where the sum is taken only over nearby sites and @xmath65 , @xmath66 . for random phases under tangent",
    "the diagonal disorder is distributed in lorentzian way and the model becomes equivalent to the 3d lloyd model . while we also investigated the kick form ( [ ll ] ) ( see section iv ) our main results have been obtained for @xmath67 in the case of two frequencies @xmath31 . according to @xcite in this case",
    "the equation for eigenfunctions can be also reduced to an effective solid - state hamiltonian which , however , has a bit more complicated form than ( [ tt ] ) .",
    "we choose ( [ vkr ] ) since it was numerically more efficient than ( [ ll ] ) . to decrease the number of parameters we always kept @xmath68 .",
    "the one - particle transition as a function of coupling ( hopping ) parameter @xmath69 in ( [ vkr ] ) is presented in fig.1 .",
    "similar to @xcite the localization length @xmath3 is determined from the stationary probability distribution over unperturbed levels @xmath70 while the diffusion rate is extracted from the gaussian form of the probability distribution @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "according to fig.1 the transition takes place at the critical hopping value @xmath73 .",
    "below @xmath74 all quasi - energy states are localized .",
    "the independence of transition point from quasi - energy is one of useful properties of kr models .",
    "our main aim was the investigation of tip effects well below the transition point @xmath74 .",
    "as in @xcite we characterized the dymamics ( [ qmap ] ) by the second moments along the diagonal line @xmath75  : @xmath76 and across it @xmath77 .",
    "we also computed the total probability distribution along and across this diagonal @xcite : @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "the typical case is presented in figs .",
    "these pictures definitely show the appearence of pair propagation even if the interaction is neither attractive nor repulsive .",
    "indeed , the pair size is much less than the distance on which two particles are propagating together .",
    "if we fit the probability distibution in fig.3 as @xmath80 then we can see that the ratio @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is quite large .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath83 at different moments of time is closer to an exponential ( @xmath84 ) than to a gaussian ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the spreading along the lattice leads only to growth of @xmath86 with time but the shape of distribution does not corresponds to a diffusive process .",
    "another interesting feature of fig.2 is the slow decrease of the rate of @xmath87 growth and the slow growth of @xmath88 . to check",
    "if the growth of @xmath87 is completely suppressed with time we analysed its dependence on @xmath89 for different values of interaction @xmath8 ( fig.4 , probability distribution is shown in fig.5 ) .",
    "for @xmath90 the growth of @xmath87 is completely suppressed while for @xmath91 the complete suppression is a bit less evident . to understand in a better way the case @xmath91",
    "we can look on the dependence of the number of effectively excited levels @xmath92 on time . to estimate @xmath92 we should rewrite ( [ qmap ] ) in the extended basis where the evolution operator has the form : @xmath93 ) \\exp ( -i [ v(\\theta,\\theta_1,\\theta_2)+v(\\theta',\\theta_1,\\theta_2 ) ] ) \\end{array } \\label{exsp2}\\ ] ] since @xmath94 the number of excited levels can be estimated as @xmath95 . following the standard estimate based on the uncertainty relation @xcite",
    "a delocalization can take place only if @xmath92 grows faster than the first power of @xmath89 . as our numerical data show ( see fig .",
    "6 ) the ratio @xmath96 remains approximately constant or is even slightly decreasing in time .",
    "this indicates that our case is similar to localization in @xmath97 where this ratio also remains constant for very long time .",
    "the reason why below @xmath74 the situation is similar to @xmath97 can be understand in the following way . according to ( [ exsp2 ] )",
    "the total dimension is 4 and we have there 2 particles .",
    "therefore , we can argue that the dimension per particle is 2 and that below the 3d delocalization border @xmath74 our system effectively represents two particles in an effective dimension @xmath98 . however , two particles in 2d are always localized but the localization length can be exponentially large .",
    "the dependence of @xmath87 at fixed moment of time on @xmath69 is presented in fig.7 and indeed , it demonstrates a sharp increase of @xmath87 with @xmath3 approaching @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for @xmath99 our model effectively represents tip in 2d . below @xmath74",
    "the pair created by interaction remains localized but the localization length @xmath2 grows exponentially with @xmath3 . to see effects of interaction in @xmath100 we should study the system with three modulational frequencies @xmath49 . but",
    "before to analyse the case @xmath49 we would like to discuss the behaviour of @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , figs .",
    "2,4 clearly demonstrate a slow growth of @xmath88 with time which means the increase of the size of the pair @xmath101 .",
    "the results presented in fig.8 show that @xmath102 grows logarithmically with time as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is some time independent factor being @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "of course , this logarithmic growth should terminate after the complete localization in @xmath87 but this time scale @xmath107 is very large and for @xmath108 we have clear logarithmic growth of @xmath101 . as discussed in @xcite",
    "we attribute this growth to the fact that propagating in a random potential the pair is affected by some effective noise which leads to a slow separation of two particles . indeed , the matrix elements of interaction @xmath109 decay exponentially fast with the growth of the pair size @xmath110 according to a rough estimate @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "these small but finite matrix elements lead to the growth of the pair size @xmath101 with slow diffusion rate @xmath113 . according to the relation @xmath114 the pair size grows as @xmath115 @xcite which is in agreement with data of fig.7 .",
    "more detailed numerical simulations are required to verify the dependence @xmath116 .",
    "according to the above discussion the suppression of diffusive growth of @xmath87 can be explained by two factors .",
    "the first one is that the effective dimension is @xmath98 and localization always takes place in 2d .",
    "another reason is the slow logarithmic growth of pair size . to separate these two effects we investigated the dynamics of tip in the krm with three modulational frequencies @xmath49 . in the extended phase space",
    "the evolution operator has the form @xmath117 ) \\\\",
    "\\exp ( -i [ v(\\theta,\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\theta_3)+ v(\\theta',\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\theta_3 ) ] ) \\end{array } \\label{exsp3}\\ ] ] with @xmath118 for @xmath52 we have one particle in 4d and transition to delocalization takes place above a critical value of perturbation parameter @xmath74 . according to our numerical data @xmath119 for @xmath120 ( fig.9 ) . below @xmath74",
    "all eigenstates are exponentially localized . for @xmath121",
    "the total dimension in ( [ exsp3 ] ) is 5 and since we have 2 particles the effective dimension per particle is @xmath122 . since @xmath100",
    "the first argument given above becomes not relevant and we expect tip delocalization below @xmath74 .",
    "let us to note that above @xmath74 the above tip problem becomes not interesting since even without interaction the particles spread along the lattice and the interaction between them does not affect significantly their dynamics .",
    "the numerical simulations of tip for ( [ exsp3 ] ) - ( [ vkr3 ] ) in one - particle localized phase @xmath123 demonstrate strong enhancement of two particles propagation .",
    "a typical case is presented in figs . 10,11 . according to these data",
    "the growth of @xmath87 is unlimited and tip delocalization takes place below @xmath74 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath124 shows that pair size @xmath102 grows logarithmically with time similar to the case with @xmath31 .",
    "we think that this slow growth of @xmath101 is responsable for a slow decrease of the pair diffusion rate @xmath125 with time .",
    "due to the increase of @xmath101 the probability to have a distance between particles of the order of @xmath3 decreases as @xmath126 and therefore , we expect that the diffusion rate of the pair will decrease with time as @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 and @xmath129 is some effective `` subdiffusion '' rate .",
    "while the above probability argument gives @xmath128 it is quite possible that sticking in the region with @xmath130 will give a faster decrease of @xmath131 with a higher value of @xmath63 .",
    "as it was discussed in @xcite the growth of pair size should also give logarithmic corrections to the coherent localization length in the quasi-1d case ( [ est ] ) ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "another confirmation for the delocalization transition below one  particle threshold is given by the analysis of the number of effectively excited states . indeed for @xmath49 one has @xmath133 .",
    "according to our data , for sufficiently strong interaction @xmath8 the quantity @xmath134 grows approximately linearly with time ( see fig . 12 ) while for small @xmath8 values @xmath135 decreases with time .",
    "contrary to the case @xmath31 this indicates that tip delocalization takes place for @xmath8 values bigger than a critical @xmath136 . above this critical value",
    "the number of excited states at a given time grows when @xmath69 approaches to one  particle delocalization border @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "we also studied the model ( [ qmap ] ) with the kick perturbation given by ( [ ll ] ) . in this case , the non interacting problem can be reduced to the lloyd model with pseudo  random sites energies @xcite . for @xmath31 and @xmath137 the one particle delocalization border is @xmath138 @xcite . for tip problem",
    "the behaviour of this model is similar to that of section ii .",
    "the strong enhancement of propagation is demonstrated in fig . 14 . even if the investigation of this model is more difficult for the numerical simulations ,",
    "our data indicate , as it was in section ii , that for @xmath31 the suppression of @xmath87 is always present . in the same way we attribute this behaviour to the effective two dimensionality of the model @xmath139 .",
    "we also analyzed the tangent model ( [ qmap ] ) , ( [ ll ] ) for the case of three frequencies @xmath49 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "this case is similar to that discussed in section iii .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath141 is presented in fig .",
    "15 and indicates the existence of delocalization transition for tip below one particle delocalization border with @xmath142 .",
    "our numerical investigations definitely demonstrate the effect of enhancement of the localization length for tip in a random potential .",
    "these results were obtained for kicked rotators models with frequency modulation .",
    "such approach allows to model efficiently tip problem in an effective dimension @xmath143 .",
    "numerical data for these models confirm the theoretical expectations @xcite that tip delocalization in @xmath0 is possible below one  particle delocalization border . in agreement with @xcite",
    "we found tip pair delocalization and , at the same time , a logarithmic growth of the pair size .",
    "we attribute this growth to the noise produced by the random potential . indeed a pair propagating in a random",
    "potential sees different realizations of disorder which act like some effective noise .",
    "such noise originates transitions which increase the distance between the two particles .",
    "even if the amplitude of these transitions is exponentially decreasing with the two  particle distance , it gives rise to logarithmic growth of pair size with time .",
    "this in turn produces a subdiffusive pair propagation @xmath144 .",
    "we give arguments for @xmath128 , but it is possible that due to sticking in the region with large distance between particles one can have @xmath145 .",
    "further investigations should be done in order to determine the exact value of @xmath63 .",
    "another qualitative argument for the subdiffusive propagation is the tunneling between states in which the two particles are far from each other ( at a distance @xmath25 ) and states in which particles stay within @xmath3 ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "these states are quasi - degenerate since the spectrum of delocalized states is embedded in the spectrum of localized ones . in this situation",
    "even an exponentially small overlapping between these two kinds of states becomes important and it can lead to a subdiffusive pair propagation . further work should be done for a better understanding of the final spectrum structure and the eigenfunctions properties for tip in 3d .",
