    "the nature of halo gas ( a.k.a .",
    "circumgalactic medium ; cgm hereafter ) , on galactocentric distances of @xmath1 kpc , is a problem of significant ongoing interest in galaxy formation .",
    "halo gas links galaxies from the intergalactic medium and is the conduit for exchange of matter energy density , momentum , angular momentum and metals between star formation and active galactic nucleus induced outflow and gravitational inflow of gas .",
    "thus , understanding halo gas is imperative before a satisfactory theory of galaxy formation and evolution may be constructed .",
    "there has been recent rapid advances on the observational front to address this important issue , made possible primarily by hst observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in @xcite we investigate the overall gas composition with respect to the density , temperature and metallicity and find that , on average , for @xmath2 ( red , blue ) galaxies cold ( @xmath3k ) gas is the primary component in the inner regions , with its mass comprising 50% of all gas within @xmath4 kpc . at @xmath5 kpc for ( red , blue ) galaxies ,",
    "the hot ( @xmath6k ) component becomes the majority component .",
    "the warm ( @xmath7k ) component is , on average , a perpetual minority in both red and blue galaxies , with its contribution peaking at @xmath8 at @xmath9 kpc in blue galaxies and never exceeding 5% in red galaxies .",
    "these findings are in agreement with recent observations in many aspects , in particular with respect to the amount of warm gas in star forming galaxies and the amount of cold gas in early type galaxies at low redshift , both of which are physically intriguing and at first instant less than intuitive .    in light of a new observational development with respect to the nv to ovi absorption line ratio and in particular the apparent need of seemingly complicated , perhaps contrived , models to explain the data",
    ", we here perform a detailed analysis of our high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to assess whether _ ab initio _ cosmological simulations are capable of accounting for this particular observation , in the larger context of the success of the model able to match the overall composition of halo gas , among others .",
    "it is particularly relevant to note that the good agreement between our simulations and observations with respect ovi @xmath101032 , 1038 absorption lines , presented earlier in @xcite , suggests that the statistical description of the properties of the warm component in the simulations - mass , spatial distribution , density , temperature , metallicity , and their environmental dependences - has now been firmly validated and provides a critical anchor point for our model .",
    "consequently , this additional , independent analysis with respect to nv / ovi ratio and other ratios becomes very powerful to further strengthen or falsify our model or our simulations .",
    "our findings here are both encouraging and intriguing .",
    "if one uses a fixed , solar n / o ratio regardless of the o / h ratio , our model is acceptable , with all 4 ks ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) test p - values greater than 0.28 for either haardt - madau ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hm hereafter ) or hm+local radiation field , where the local radiation field is due to hot gas in the host galaxy .",
    "if one allows for a dependence of the n / o ratio on the o / h ratio , both measured by independent observations and motivated by theoretical considerations of two different sources of n , then our model is able to account for the observations highly successfully , with all ks test p - values exceeding 0.9 .",
    "we additionally examine the following absorption line column density ratios where comparisons to observations may be made in a reasonable statistical fashion , siiv / ovi , nii / ovi and niii / ovi , and find that the ratios from our simulations are fully consistent with observations .",
    "we also investigate the model where uv radiation from local shock heated gas in concerned galaxies are added to the hm background , which is found to also agree with observations with comparable p - values for all line ratios examined .",
    "however , these good agreements come about because observational data points are dominated by upper and lower limits instead of actual detections .",
    "we discuss how some moderate improvment in observational sensitivity may provide much stronger tests of models .",
    "we perform cosmological simulations with the amr eulerian hydro code , enzo @xcite .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite lcdm model : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these parameters are also consistent with the latest planck results @xcite , if one adopts the hubble constant that is the average between planck value and those derived based on sne ia and hst key program @xcite .",
    "we use the power spectrum transfer functions for cold dark matter particles and baryons using fitting formulae from @xcite .",
    "we use the enzo inits program to generate initial conditions .",
    "first we ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath17mpc on a side .",
    "we identified two regions separately , one centered on a cluster of mass of @xmath18 and the other centered on a void region at @xmath19 .",
    "we then re - simulate each of the two regions separately with high resolution , but embedded in the outer @xmath17mpc box to properly take into account large - scale tidal field and appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the refined region .",
    "we name the simulation centered on the cluster ",
    "c \" run and the one centered on the void  v \" run .",
    "the refined region for  c \" run has a size of @xmath20mpc@xmath21 and that for  v \" run is @xmath22mpc@xmath21 . at their respective volumes , they represent @xmath23 and @xmath24 fluctuations .",
    "the root grid has a size of @xmath25 with @xmath25 dark matter particles .",
    "the initial static grids in the two refined boxes correspond to a @xmath26 grid on the outer box . the initial number of dark matter particles in the two refined boxes correspond to @xmath26 particles on the outer box .",
    "this translates to initial condition in the refined region having a mean interparticle - separation of @xmath27 kpc comoving and dark matter particle mass of @xmath28 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by two layers ( each of @xmath29mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath30 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath31 times that in the refined region .",
    "the initial density fluctuations are included up to the nyquist frequency in the refined region .",
    "the surrounding volume outside the refined region is also followed hydrodynamically , which is important in order to properly capture matter and energy exchanges at the boundaries of the refined region . because we still can not run a very large volume simulation with adequate resolution and physics , we choose these two runs of moderate volumes to represent two opposite environments that possibly bracket the universal average .",
    "we choose a varying mesh refinement criterion scheme such that the resolution is always better than @xmath32/h proper parsecs within the refined region , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath33 above @xmath34 , of @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background @xcite , and a model for shielding of uv radiation @xcite .",
    "the simulations also include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling and heating @xcite .",
    "the enzo version used includes metallicity - dependent radiative cooling extended down to @xmath35k , molecular formation on dust grains , photoelectric heating and other features that are different from or not in the public version of enzo code .",
    "we clarify that our group has included metal cooling and metal heating ( due to photoionization of metals ) in all our studies since @xcite for the avoidance of doubt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "each star particle is tagged with its initial mass , creation time , and metallicity ; star particles typically have masses of @xmath39@xmath40 .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell ( i.e. , weighting is equal to the inverse of density ) , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "we allow the whole feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating , as in nature .",
    "the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported into right directions in a physically sound ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) way , at least in a statistical sense . in our simulations metals",
    "are followed hydrodynamically by solving the metal density continuity equation with sources ( from star formation feedback ) and sinks ( due to subsequent star formation ) .",
    "thus , metal mixing and diffusion through advection , turbulence and other hydrodynamic processes are properly treated in our simulations .",
    "the primary advantages of this supernova energy based feedback mechanism are three - fold .",
    "first , nature does drive winds in this way and energy input is realistic .",
    "second , it has only one free parameter @xmath41 , namely , the fraction of the rest mass energy of stars formed that is deposited as thermal energy on the cell scale at the location of supernovae .",
    "third , the processes are treated physically , obeying their respective conservation laws ( where they apply ) , allowing transport of metals , mass , energy and momentum to be treated self - consistently and taking into account relevant heating / cooling processes at all times .",
    "we use @xmath42 in these simulations .",
    "the total amount of explosion kinetic energy from type ii supernovae with a chabrier imf translates to @xmath43 .",
    "observations of local starburst galaxies indicate that nearly all of the star formation produced kinetic energy ( due to type ii supernovae ) is used to power galactic superwinds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the uncertainties on the evolution of imf with redshift ( i.e. , possibly more top heavy at higher redshift ) and the fact that newly discovered prompt type i supernovae contribute a comparable amount of energy compared to type ii supernovae , it seems that our adopted value for @xmath41 is consistent with observations and physically realistic .",
    "the validity of this thermal energy - based feedback approach comes empirically . in @xcite the metal distribution in and around galaxies over a wide range of redshift ( @xmath44 )",
    "is shown to be in excellent agreement with respect to the properties of observed damped @xmath45 systems @xcite , whereas in @xcite we further show that the properties of ovi absorption lines at low redshift , including their abundance , doppler - column density distribution , temperature range , metallicity and coincidence between ovii and ovi lines , are all in good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "this is non - trivial by any means , because they require that the transport of metals and energy from galaxies to star formation sites to megaparsec scale be correctly modeled as a function of distance over the entire cosmic timeline , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "we identify galaxies at each redshift in the simulations using the hop algorithm @xcite operating on the stellar particles , which is tested to be robust and insensitive to specific choices of concerned parameters within reasonable ranges .",
    "satellites within a galaxy down to mass of @xmath46 are clearly identified separately in most cases .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle in each of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) five bands is computed using the gissel stellar synthesis code @xcite , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , sfr , luminosities in five sdss bands ( and various colors ) and others .",
    "we show , among others , that the simulated luminosity functions of galaxies at @xmath19 are reasonably matched to observations @xcite .",
    "in the analysis presented here we choose randomly ten galaxies from our simulation that have properties that are similar to observed galaxies in the cos - halo program @xcite with respect to the star formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass .",
    "some relevant properties of the ten simulated galaxies are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "a central galaxy is defined to be one that is not within the virial radius of a larger ( halo - mass - wise ) galaxy .",
    ".properties of 10 simulated galaxies used in this study . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : ks ]    to gain a more quantitative statistical test between simulations and observations , we perform two - sample ks tests between simulated and observed column density ratios for four pairs of lines , nv / ovi , nii / nv , niii / ovi and siiv / ovi .",
    "since most of the observational data are upper and lower limits , instead of actual detections , our analysis is performed as follows . for the case where the numerator line is an upper limit and",
    "the denominator line is a detection , we allow the ratio to be drawn from the simulation distribution with value upper - bounded by the upper limit . the same is done for the case where the numerator line is an upper limit and the denominator line is a lower limit .",
    "then , in conjunction with detections , where both lines are detected , we perform a two - sample ks test for each of the four line pairs , nv / ovi , nii / nv , niii / ovi and siiv / ovi , between simulations and observations . needless to say , our presently adopted procedure to treat the upper and lower limits cases favors agreement with observations and simulations . nevertheless , the procedure is consistent with the current data .",
    "the results are tabulated in table [ table : ks ] . clearly , no major disagreements can be claimed as to reject the simulation results in all four cases , ( constant n / o , varying",
    "n / o ) times ( hm , hm+local )",
    ". however , there are hints , at face value , that the constant n / o cases are less preferred than the varying n / o cases .",
    "nonetheless , it is premature to make any firm statistical conclusion on that at this juncture .",
    "thus , the only robust conclusion we can reach at this time is that our simulation predictions are fully consistent with extant observational data with respect to the four line ratios , nv / ovi , nii / nv , niii / ovi and siiv / ovi .",
    "what would exponentially increase the statistical power of testing the models is to turn these current upper limits into real detections .",
    "we have performed the following exercise to demonstrate this point .",
    "let us assume that all current upper limits of the column density ratios become detections and the detection values are lower than current upper limits uniformly by a factor of @xmath47 dex .",
    "we find that , if @xmath48 , the ks p - values for the nv / ovi line ratio become @xmath49 for the ( hm , hm+local ) cases with constant n / o ; with @xmath50 , the ks p - values for the nv / ovi line ratio become @xmath51 for the ( hm , hm+local ) cases with constant n / o . for the varying n / o cases , the situation is non - monotonic in the following sense : the ks p - values for the nv / ovi line ratio are @xmath52 for the ( hm , hm+local ) with @xmath53 , increasing to a maximum of @xmath54 with @xmath55 , then downturning to @xmath51 with @xmath56 . obviously , a uniform shift is an oversimplification .",
    "nevertheless , this shows clearly an urgent need to increase observational sensitivity in order to place significantly stronger constraints on models than currently possible .",
    "when all line pairs are deployed , the statistical power will be still , likely much , greater .",

    "cm    -0.0 cm -1.0 cm -0.0 cm -0.0 cm -1.0 cm -0.0 cm -0.0 cm    finally , we turn to a closer examination of the physical conditions that give rise to the various absorption lines in our simulations shown above . in figure",
    "[ fig : contour_zn ] we show the number density of lines in the column density - metallicity plane for ovi ( top - left panel ) , nv ( top - right panel ) , niii ( bottom - right panel ) and siiv ( bottom - left panel ) .",
    "overall , while there is a significant span in metallicity , with as low as @xmath57=-3.5 $ ] at the low column density end for ovi , the vast majority of absorbers have metallicities falling into the range @xmath58=-2 $ ] to @xmath59 for ovi , @xmath58=-2 $ ] to @xmath59 for nv , @xmath58=-2 $ ] to @xmath59 for nv and @xmath58=-1 $ ] to @xmath59 for siiv . at the high column density end , we see @xmath58\\sim -0.5 $ ] to @xmath60 for ovi , @xmath58\\sim -0.5 $ ] to @xmath61 for nv , @xmath58\\sim 0 $ ] to @xmath61 for niii and @xmath58\\sim 0 $ ] to @xmath61 for siiv .",
    "these trends and significant disparities between different lines are a results of complex multi - phase cgm with a very inhomogeneous metallicity distribution .",
    "simplistic collisional excitation / ionization models are unlikely to be able to capture all of the key elements of the physical processes involved and may lead to conclusions that are not necessarily conformal to direct analyses of the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : contour_tn ] shows the number density of lines in the column density - temperature plane for ovi ( top - left panel ) , nv ( top - right panel ) , niii ( bottom - right panel ) and siiv ( bottom - left panel ) . to set the context of collisionally dominated ionization processes , we note that , under the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium , as in cloudy , the peak temperature for the element in question with half - width - half - maximum is approximately @xmath62k for ovi , @xmath63k for nv , @xmath64k for niii and @xmath65k for siiv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a one - to - one comparison between each of these four peak temperature ( and its width ) and the contour levels indicates that for ovi and nv lines the collisional ionization dominates the process for creating ovi at @xmath66@xmath67 and nvi at @xmath68@xmath67 , respectively , manifested in the horizontal extension of the contours pointing to the right at the temperature ( with an appropriate width ) in question .",
    "the same can be said about the siiv line at the high column end @xmath69@xmath67 ; however , at lower @xmath70 values ( @xmath71@xmath67 ) , the contours are no longer aligned horizontally , indicative of enhanced contribution of photoionization due to lower ionization potential of siiii ( @xmath72ev ) versus say ov ( @xmath73ev ) .",
    "similar statements about niii lines to those for siiv can be made due to similar reasons .",
    "overall , the similarity between ovi and nv lines suggests that collisional ionization processes are dominant and results with respect to these two lines are relatively immune to uncertainties in the radiation field used .",
    "however , the apparent insensitivity of results on the radiation field with detailed calculation we have performed , in the way of comparing hm and hm+local results , indicates that the net effect due to an increase of radiation field is relatively small due to the large ranges of density and metallicity of gas involved , although the actual situation appears to be more intertwined because of nonlinear relationships between density , metallicity , ionization parameter and column density . as an example ,",
    "as shown earlier in figure  [ fig : cover ] , a stronger radiation field tend to increase the abundance of niii , although the difference between hm and hm+local cases for is apparently minor , seeming to suggest conflictingly that collisional processes are the primary powering source for producing niii",
    ". a more thorough theoretical study and a more detailed comparison to observations will be desirable , when a larger observational sample with more sensitive column density detection limits becomes available .",
    "as we have demonstrated , a fraction of a dex increase in sensitivity may warrant a revisit to a detailed comparison .",
    "in light of a recent conclusion that the observed line ratios of uv absorbers in the cgm may pose a significant challenge for theoretical models @xcite , we study five uv absorption lines , ovi @xmath101032 , 1038 , siiv @xmath101394 , 1402 , nv @xmath101239 , 1243 , niii @xmath74990 , nii @xmath741084 , in the cgm of simulated galaxies , utilizing _ ab initio _ ultra - high resolution ( * laozi * ) hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our simulated galaxies are chosen to have stellar masses and star formation rates similar to their observed counterpart .",
    "we examine uncertainties related to the radiation background by computing separately for two cases of radiation field , one with the hm radiation background and the other with both hm and local radiation due to hot gas in the host galaxy . separately and orthogonally ,",
    "we examine two separate cases of nitrogen to oxygen ratio , in one case with constant n / o and in the other with varying n / o that is theoretically consistent with two different synthetic sources of nitrogen and observationally confirmed by independent observations .",
    "@xcite find constant density photoionization models to be excluded by the data .",
    "they find collisional ( both in and out of equilibrium ) ionization to be only broadly consistent with the data .",
    "they suggest either collisionally - ionized gas cooling behind a fast shock or a highly structured gas photo - ionized by a local high energy source as plausible models to account of the observed ovi column density range and line ratios .",
    "in contrast , we do not find significant difficulty in accounting for the same observational data in our cosmological simulations that capture the complex multi - phase structure of the cgm , as reflected by the acceptable ks test p - values for column density ratios of four pairs of lines nv / ovi , siiv / ovi , niii / ovi and nii / ovi examined .",
    "inter - comparisons between results from different models employing different radiation fields in our simulations and comparisons between properties of the absorbers and expectations of collisional ionization indicate that collisional ionization play a major role in producing all the lines studied in realistic cgm produced in cosmological simulations .",
    "photoionization process plays a significant role as well , to a varying degree , depending on the ion in question , although it seems clear that for nv and ovi lines photoionization effect is relatively minor .",
    "the success of our largely collisional ionization model in all cases is , however , in a significant part , due to very accommodative observational line ratio data points that are dominated , in number , by upper limits rather than actual detections .",
    "we find the apparent satisfactory agreement between simulations and extant observational data can be strongly tested and different cases ( different radiation fields and different n / o ratio assumptions ) differentiated , if most of the current upper limits in the observational data become detections . to demonstrate the power , we show , as an example , that if the upper limits of nv / ovi become detections with values that are lower by a mere @xmath75 dex than their respective current upper limits , the ks p - value for the nv / ovi line ratio becomes @xmath76 for the constant n / o case and @xmath77 for the varying n / o case .",
    "if , on the other hand , the actual detection values turn out to be lower than current upper limits by @xmath78 dex , then the varying n / o case obtains a satisfactory p - value of @xmath54 , whereas the constant n / o case is endowed with a p - value equal to zero .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to increase the observational sensitivity and/or enlarge observational data sample size , in order to have a definitive test .",
