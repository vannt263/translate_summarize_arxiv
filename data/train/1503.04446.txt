    "it is commonly believed that the current baryon number asymmetry was created at the early stage of our universe .",
    "it is however known that the standard model of particle physics is not able to realize it , and cp violation beyond the standard model ( bsm ) is therefore required .",
    "one promising experimental approach to search for the cp violation is the measurement of the _ electric dipole moment _ ( edm ) @xcite .",
    "the edm is an observable very sensitive to it , and has many advantages , such as the accurate measurability in experiments , low cost in the experimental preparation , very small standard model contribution @xcite , etc , and it was so far measured in various systems , such as the neutron @xcite , atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite , and muon @xcite .    among them ,",
    "the nuclear edm is of particular interest @xcite .",
    "recently , the measurement of the edm of light nuclei using storage rings is planned at the brookhaven national laboratory , and the prospective sensitivity is @xmath7 cm @xcite .",
    "the nuclear edm also has its own advantages .",
    "first , the nuclear edm does not suffer from schiff s screening @xcite , since we have no electrons to screen the charged nucleus .",
    "also , the nuclear system may enhance the nucleon level cp violation due to the many - body effect @xcite .",
    "these arguments make the nuclear edm to be a very attractive probe of strong sector cp violation , and theoretical investigations of the deuteron @xcite and three - nucleon systems @xcite were extensively done so far .    as a natural choice of the next target of the discussion",
    ", we have the @xmath0li nucleus , since it is the lightest stable system with non - zero angular momentum which can be found after the three - nucleon systems .",
    "the @xmath0li nucleus is known to have a cluster structure @xcite , so we may expect some enhancement of the nucleon level cp violation , due to the derivative interaction of the cp - odd hamiltonian . in this sense , the analysis of the @xmath0li edm may also be interesting in the point - of - view of the study of the nuclear structure and the cluster dynamics @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we therefore investigate the edm of the @xmath0li nucleus in the cluster approximation , as the @xmath8 three - body system .",
    "we also calculate the edm of the @xmath3be nucleus , which is calculable in the same framework @xcite , and a test of ab initio calculations of the deuteron , the @xmath5he , and @xmath5h nuclei using the argonne @xmath6 interaction @xcite . to solve the many - body schrdinger equation , we use the gaussian expansion method @xcite .",
    "this method was applied in a wide number of subjects , extending from the particle to atomic physics @xcite , and it is also expected to give accurate results in the study of the edm of few - nucleon systems .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give the definition of the edm .",
    "we then briefly review our calculational method .",
    "the result of the edm of the @xmath0li nucleus is then given , together with the edms of @xmath3be , @xmath5he , @xmath5h , and @xmath9h nuclei .",
    "we finally see the prospect for the determination of the new physics bsm and summarize our discussion .",
    "to induce the nuclear edm , the existence of the p , cp - odd nucleon level processes is required .",
    "the nuclear edm has two leading sources : ( 1 ) the intrinsic edm of the constituent nucleons , and ( 2 ) the p , cp - odd @xmath10 interactions ( nuclear force ) to polarize the whole nucleus .",
    "in this work , we neglect the exchange current , since its contribution is expected to be small @xcite .",
    "we first give the contribution of the intrinsic edm of the constituent nucleons to the nuclear edm . as",
    "the nucleon edm is proportional to the nucleon spin , the effect is simply given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the polarized nuclear wave function ( @xmath13 @xmath9h , @xmath5he , @xmath5h , @xmath0li , @xmath3be ) . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the proton and neutron edms , respectively .",
    "these are given parameters which depend on the qcd and elementary level physics .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 are just the spin matrix elements of the nucleus , and depend only on the nuclear structure .",
    "the contribution of the single nucleon edm may be enhanced if the nucleon is relativistic inside the nucleus , as for the atomic systems @xcite . as the nucleons are nonrelativistic in light nuclei",
    ", the linear coefficients of the systems in question will not receive sizable enhancement .",
    "the effect of the nuclear polarization generated by the cp - odd nuclear force may , in contrast , be enhanced even in light nuclear systems .",
    "the polarization contribution of the p , cp - odd nuclear force to the nuclear edm is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the polarized ( in the @xmath20-axis ) nuclear wave function , and @xmath21 is the isospin pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath22 is ( the @xmath20-component of ) the position of the constituent nucleon in the nuclear center of mass frame .",

    "the contribution from the deuteron subsystem to the @xmath0li edm takes a value close to the single deuteron edm ( about 43% of the total @xmath0li edm ) .",
    "this can also be seen by inspecting the @xmath0li edm induced by the isovector exchange of @xmath69 and @xmath63 mesons , which has no contribution to the cp - odd @xmath48 potential .",
    "as the sensitivity to them takes values very close to those of the deuteron edm , we may say that the deuteron cluster is relevant in the @xmath0li edm .",

    "the enhancement of the cp - odd effect in the @xmath0li is more accentuated .",
    "we must however be careful on it , since it may be an overestimation , as the short range part was averaged due to the folding .",
    "the calculated contributions of the isovector cp - odd @xmath69 and @xmath63 exchange potential are reliable since their effects arise only from the deuteron cluster .",
    "we must also note that the isoscalar and isotensor cp - odd potentials do not contribute to the @xmath0li edm , due to the inert @xmath2 cluster and the isospin symmetry .",
    "it is however to be noted that this is not the case if we consider the isospin breaking effect together with the excitation of the @xmath2 cluster , since the spin and isospin structures become active @xcite .",

    "the sensitivity of the @xmath3be on the cp - odd potential is much more important , but this is probably an overestimation , since all those effects arise from the dangerous folding of the heavy meson exchange cp - odd nuclear force . as for the @xmath0li , there are also cp - odd interactions which may contribute with the excitation of the @xmath2 cluster . a more careful inspection of them are therefore needed at a more microscopic level .

    "the difference from the experimental values ( 7.7 mev for @xmath5he and 8.4 mev for @xmath5h ) is understood as the lack of the three - body force contribution @xcite . for the edms of the @xmath5he and @xmath5h ,",
