    "following many years of effort , there is now indisputable experimental evidence for @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing .",
    "the current values ( the hfag ` no cpv - allowed ' fit  @xcite ) of the @xmath0 mixing parameters are @xmath4 these show that ( i ) charm mixing occurs at about the percent level , ( ii ) @xmath5 are comparable in magnitude and ( iii ) the signs of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive ( although a direct measurement of the sign of @xmath6 is yet to be made ) .    while it is quite likely that the observed mixing amplitude is dominated by the standard model contributions , the exact predictions are quite difficult .",
    "there are several reasons for this  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the `` short distance '' approach  @xcite at leading order in the operator product expansion ( ope ) formalism ( operators of dimension @xmath8 ) , the individual diagrams are ckm - suppressed to the level @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the familiar wolfenstein parameter ) , hinting that the observed charm mixing is a simple consequence of ckm structure .",
    "this is , however , not correct because severe cancellations between diagrams ( even through @xmath11 ) greatly reduce the @xmath8 mixing to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "as for higher ( @xmath13 ) orders in ope , it is true that certain enhanced contributions have been identified  @xcite , but a definitive evaluation is lacking due to the large number of @xmath13 operators and the inability to determine their matrix elements . a promising alternative approach which involves a hadron - level description  @xcite may be able to account for the observed magnitude of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , but predicts their relative sign to be opposite .",
    "it is fair to say that this is probably not the final word on the sm analysis .",
    "given the uncertain status of the sm description , it would be tempting but premature  @xcite to attribute the observed @xmath6 to new physics . in this paper .",
    "not only does the sm estimate for @xmath7 work reasonably well when long distance effects are included  @xcite , but it has also been shown that np effects are too small to have any significant impact  @xcite . ] but clearly , the possibility that np makes a significant or even dominant contribution to the observed mixing is open .",
    "a recent comprehensive treatment of np models  @xcite shows that a large number of such models can accommodate a value of @xmath6 at the per cent level .",
    "this encourages us to further explore the np option .",
    "in particular , new physics could affect charm - related processes beyond mixing , such as rare decays  @xcite .",
    "of special interest are the @xmath14 decays . at present , there are only the upper limits  @xcite _ d^0 ^+^- & & 1.310 ^ -6 , _",

    "such branching fractions place bounds on possible np couplings , which can be compared with that obtained from @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing . in this paper",
    "we study the impact of np on the combined system of @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and the rare decays @xmath2 .",
    "it should be stressed that the sm rate for the decay mode , @xmath16 can be estimated fairly reliably even upon accounting for the effect of long distance enhancement  @xcite .",
    "this smallness of the sm signal makes it easier for np contributions to stand out . in this paper , we point out how , in certain np models , the _ same _ couplings occur in the amplitudes for both @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and @xmath2 decay .",
    "if the np effects are significant in mixing , then a correlation will exist between the magnitudes of each .",
    "in fact the correlation can be very simple and striking , with the branching fraction @xmath17 being proportional to the mixing parameter @xmath6 .    for each np model considered in this paper",
    ", we shall make the simplifying assumption that the np dominates @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing and then derive the correlated branching fraction that is then predicted . obviously ,",
    "if np does _ not _ dominate , all our results for the branching fractions become upper bounds .",
    "we shall stress the general issue of which conditions allow for such correlations and give specific examples .",
    "finally , even if the number of parameters in a given np model is too large to give a unique prediction for @xmath17 in terms of @xmath6 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath18 models , _ etc _ ) , we show in sects .",
    "iii  b - d how it is possible to estimate the scale of @xmath17 by using the value of @xmath6 as input .",
    "heavy particles present in np models are not produced in final states of charm quark decays . yet , effects generated by exchanges of these new particles can be accounted for in effective operators built out of the sm degrees of freedom . that is , by integrating out degrees of freedom associated with new interactions at a heavy scale @xmath19 , we obtain an effective hamiltonian written in the form of a series of operators of increasing dimension . here , we restrict our attention to the leading order operators , of dimension @xmath8 . for both @xmath20 mixing and @xmath2 decays , the complete basis of effective operators is known and is expressed most conveniently in terms of chiral quark fields , [ seriesofoperators ] f",
