    "this result , based on the bethe ansatz solution of the one - dimensional fermi - hubbard model , is currently motivating experimentalists to investigate the fermionic mott - insulator phase in optical lattices @xcite . very recently , the mmit has been theoretically investigated for a fermionic system with interactions near the unitary limit @xcite .",
    "the competition between the bcs - superfluid and the insulator phases in strongly interacting fermions systems has also been studied in ref.@xcite .",

    "we observe a parabolic density profile which points out that the whole system is in a metallic phase @xcite . when the chemical potential varies between @xmath103 , the system is characterized by a mott - insulator phase with @xmath104 , localized at the center of the trap and surrounded by two metallic phases . for @xmath105 ,",
    "a localized metallic phase develops in the middle of the mott - insulator phase .",
    "when the chemical potential is greater than @xmath106 , a band - insulator phase with @xmath107 appears at the center of the system : the latter is then characterized by three distinctive insulator phases , which are generally separated and surrounded by metallic phases .",

    "we notice that the variance @xmath74 is non - zero in the metallic region , where @xmath73 is not an integer .",
    "when @xmath108 , the central plateau corresponds to @xmath107 , while two plateaus at @xmath104 remain near the edges ( see fig.[dens ] @xmath111 ) .",
    "the metallic regions , which surround each insulator plateau is characterized by a non - vanishing variance @xmath74 .",
    "+ we also notice that the density vanishes at the edges of the supercell for @xmath112 , according to the fact that the particles concentrate at the center of the harmonic trap .",
    "in fact , as the chemical potential increases , the edges undergo different phases : for @xmath113 the edges are in a metallic phase , for @xmath114 the edges are in a mott - insulator phase with @xmath104 , for @xmath115 the edges are again in a metallic phase , and for @xmath116 the whole system is in a global band - insulator phase with @xmath107 .",
    "as the strength of the harmonic potential @xmath54 increases , the global phase diagram @xmath117 , represented in fig.[two_lobes ] for @xmath80 , varies : the first mott lobe ( @xmath85 ) progressively diminishes and eventually disappears for @xmath118 , while the second insulator region ( @xmath86 ) appears at increasing values of the chemical potential .",

    "fig.[av_dens ] is actually a cut through the @xmath122 phase diagram , at a fixed hopping parameter @xmath100 . in this figure",
    ", one observes that for @xmath123 , the system reaches the two insulator domain as the chemical potential increases .",
    "the mott - insulator and band - insulator phases are characterized by a vanishing average variance @xmath88 . for sufficiently small potential strength",
    ", the function @xmath124 has two plateaus at @xmath85 and @xmath125 . the first plateau progressively diminishes while @xmath54 is increased ( see fig.[av_dens ] @xmath5 , fig.[av_dens ] @xmath126 and fig.[av_dens ] @xmath127 , corresponding to @xmath80 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively ) .",
    "when @xmath130 , the function @xmath124 only reaches one plateau at @xmath131 , for @xmath132 ( see fig.[av_dens ] @xmath133 , fig.[av_dens ] @xmath134 and fig.[av_dens ] @xmath135 , corresponding to @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath101 respectively ) .",
    "+ it is worth noticing that a system with non - vanishing average variance @xmath88 may exhibit local insulator phases inside the trap .",
    "this is the case for the specific situation illustrated in fig.[dens ] @xmath111 which exhibits two plateaus at @xmath104 and @xmath107 , while @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( for @xmath108 ) .",
    "we finally note the interesting fact that if the average variance is vanishing , @xmath87 , then the local density @xmath73 is constant ( @xmath73 gives the integer filling of the whole lattice ) in spite of the inhomogeneous confining potential . we can conclude that a global mott - insulator phase enhances a homogenization of the system .",
    "the mean - field theory developed in the previous section allows one to investigate the metal - insulator phase transition in a wide range of the parameters . besides , one of the great advantages of our theory resides in the fact that we can investigate the mmit when the two - dimensional system rotates .",
    "in particular , the  high magnetic field \" regime @xmath140 , can be considered .",
    "+ the mmit phase diagram , represented in the @xmath79 plane , is affected by the presence of a high  magnetic \" field . in particular , the mott lobe corresponding to @xmath85 extends over greater values of the hopping parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we show this phenomenon in fig.[comp_phi ] , which illustrates the phase diagram for @xmath141 and @xmath142 in terms of the average variance @xmath88 ( the mott lobes are designated by @xmath87 ) . for @xmath141 ,",
    "the mott - lobe extends to the critical value @xmath143 , whereas it reaches the critical value @xmath144 for @xmath142 .",
    "we also note that the band - insulator domain ( @xmath86 ) is modified by the  magnetic \" field : for @xmath145 , one observes a critical value @xmath146 for @xmath141 , whereas one finds @xmath147 for @xmath142 .",
    "finally we point out that the insulator lobes are only modified according to the value of the  magnetic \" flux @xmath148 , and that they are not affected by the supercell length @xmath35 .",
    "a richer representation of this effect is drawn in fig.[hof_bord ] which shows the critical hopping parameter @xmath149 as a function of the flux @xmath33 for a fixed value of the chemical potential ( we set @xmath150 ) . here",
    "we set @xmath151 , so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are mutally primes for all @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "the phase boundary @xmath153 is highly irregular and exhibits pronounced slopes at @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "this figure is symmetric with respect to @xmath157 and is periodic with period @xmath158 .",
    "the general shape of the phase boundary @xmath153 is similar for all the values of the chemical potential : in particular , the mmit which takes place around the band - insulator domain ( @xmath86 ) is also described by such a curve .",
    "+ in fact , this important numerical result reveals that the phase boundary for the mmit is directly related to the edge of the hofstadter butterfly represented in fig.[square_but ] .",
    "the fact that this phase transition is intimately connected to the underlying single - particle physics is not too surprising : in the context of rotating bose gases , it is already known that the phase boundary @xmath153 for the superfluid - mott insulator transition also displays the hofstadter butterfly s edge @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that our numerical results suggest that this fact holds for rotating fermions .",
    "this important result enforces the idea that rotations , or artificial  magnetic \" fields , induces a modification to the mmit in a way which is independent of the particles statistics .",
    "moreover the universal character of this modification is dictated by the hofstadter butterfly . as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it should be noted that most of the atoms are static in the vicinity of the insulator domains .",
    "the gas of mobile particles and holes is thus highly diluted in these regions .",
    "this remark suggests that the system behaves according to single - particle physics around the insulator regions and therefore partially explains why these phase boundaries may be related to the fractal single - particle spectrum .",
    "+ finally , we note that when the system reaches the metallic phase , @xmath159 , local insulator phases may still be present in the system because of the presence of a ",
    "magnetic \" field .",
    "contrary to the effects induced by a trapping potential and described in the previous section , these local mott - insulator phases are generally periodically distributed in space .",
    "in this work , we have studied an important feature of ultracold fermions physics .",
    "we have shown that two - dimensional fermionic optical lattices should exhibit a mott metal - insulator phase transition . in the presence of a trapping potential , we have observed the formation of local mott - insulator phases , generally situated at the center of the trap .",
    "these local mott - insulator phases are characterized by a vanishing variance of the local density . when the system is subjected to an external  magnetic \" field , or",
    "equally when the system rotates , we have put forward the fact that the mott lobes are sensible to the specific value of the effective  magnetic \" flux : for a fixed chemical potential , the critical hopping parameter @xmath153 indeed follows a fractal curve as the  magnetic \" flux is varied . as in the case of the superfluid - insulator transition in 2d rotating bosonic systems ,",
    "this fractal phase boundary is directly related to the single - particle energy spectrum .",
