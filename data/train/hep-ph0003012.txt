    "the most general superpotential respecting the gauge symmetries of the standard model ( sm ) contains bilinear and trilinear terms which are not taken into account in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . restricting to the trilinear part",
    ", these additional terms read as  : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are generation indices , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denote the left - handed leptons ( quarks ) superfields , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are right - handed superfields for charged leptons , down and up - type quarks , respectively . the first two terms in eq.([super ] )",
    "lead to violation of the lepton number ( ) , while the last one implies violation of the baryon number ( ) . since the simultaneous presence of and couplings could lead to a too fast proton decay , a discrete multiplicative symmetry which forbids the above terms in the superpotential has been imposed by hand in the mssm . this symmetry , called r - parity ( @xmath17 ) , is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath20 respectively denote the baryon number , the fermion number and the spin , such that @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) for all supersymmetric ( sm ) particles .",
    "however other solutions can ensure the proton stability , e.g. if @xmath12 only is violated , or if only @xmath23 interactions are allowed and the proton is lighter than the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "moreover , on the theoretical point of view , there is no clear preference , e.g. in models inspired by grand unified or string theories , between and @xmath17 conservation  @xcite .",
    "it is thus mandatory to search for susy in both scenarios .    on the experimental side , the main consequence of lies in the possibility for the lsp to decay into ordinary matter .",
    "this is in contrast to scenarios where @xmath17 is conserved , in which the lsp is stable and escapes detection , leading to the characteristic search for missing energy signals in direct collider searches .",
    "moreover , while in @xmath17 conserved models , the ( susy ) particles must be produced in pairs , allows the single production of superpartners , thus enlarging the mass domain where susy could be discovered .",
    "in particular , couplings offer the opportunity to resonantly produce particles  @xcite.although the coupling constants are severely constrained by the low - energy experimental bounds @xcite , the superpartner resonant production can have significant cross - sections both at leptonic @xcite and hadronic @xcite colliders .",
    "this is this possibility which is exploited throughout this paper .",
    "+ the resonant production of particles is attractive for another reason : since its rate is proportional to a power @xmath24 of the relevant coupling , this reaction would allow an easier determination of the couplings than the pair production .",
    "in fact in the latter case , the sensitivity on the coupling is mainly provided by the displaced vertex analysis for the lsp decay , which is difficult experimentally especially at hadronic colliders .    in this paper , we focus on the resonant susy particle production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) operating at a center of mass energy of @xmath25  tev with special reference to the atlas detector . at the lhc due to the continuous distribution of the centre of mass energy of the colliding partons , a parton - parton resonance can be probed over a wide mass domain .",
    "this is a distinct advantage over the situation at lepton colliders , where the search for narrow resonances requires lengthy scans over the centre of mass energy of the machine .    at hadronic colliders , either a slepton or a squark",
    "can be produced at the resonance through a @xmath26 or a @xmath27 coupling constant , respectively . in the hypothesis of a single dominant coupling constant",
    ", the resonant susy particle could decay through the same coupling as in the production , leading then to a two quarks final state for the hard process @xcite . in the case where both @xmath26 and @xmath28 couplings are non - vanishing , the slepton produced via @xmath26 can decay through @xmath28 giving rise to the same final state as in drell - yan process , namely two leptons @xcite .",
    "however , for most of the values of the coupling constants allowed by present indirect searches , the decays of the resonant susy particle via gauge interactions are dominant if kinematically accessible @xcite . in this favoured situation ,",
    "typically , the produced superpartner initiates a cascade decay ended by the decay of the lsp . in case of a dominant @xmath27 coupling constant , due to the decay of the lsp into quarks ,",
    "this cascade decay leads to multijet final states which have a large qcd background @xcite . only if leptonic decays such as for instance @xmath29 enter the cascade clearer signatures",
    "can be investigated @xcite .",
    "the situation is more favourable in the hypothesis of a single @xmath26 coupling constant , where the lsp can decay into a charged lepton , allowing then multileptonic final states to be easily obtained .",
    "+ we will thus assume a dominant @xmath30 coupling constant",
    ". at hadronic colliders , either a @xmath31 sneutrino or a @xmath32 charged slepton can be produced at the resonance via @xmath30 and the initial states are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the slepton produced at the resonance has two possible gauge decays , either into a chargino or a neutralino .",
    "in both cases particularly clean signatures can be observed .",
    "for example , the production of a neutralino together with a charged lepton resulting from the resonant charged slepton production can lead to the interesting like - sign dilepton topology @xcite since , due to its majorana nature , the neutralino decays via @xmath30 into a lepton as @xmath35 and into an anti - lepton as @xmath36 with the same probability .    in this article",

    "the neutralino then decays via @xmath30 as @xmath44 or as @xmath45 .",
    "we concentrate on the decays of both the chargino and the neutralino into charged leptons , which lead to a three leptons final state .",
    "this signature has a low standard model background , and allows the reconstruction of the whole decay chain , thus providing a measurement of some parameters of the susy model .",

    "finally , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the squark , slepton and sneutrino mass , respectively .",
    "the value of the squark mass enters our study mainly in the determination of the relative branching ratios of the @xmath57 into lepton or neutrino and of the @xmath58 into @xmath57 + quarks or @xmath57 + leptons .",
    "the remaining three parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and the soft - susy breaking bilinear coupling @xmath19 are determined through the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions which are two necessary minimisation conditions of the higgs potential .",
    "we choose to study the case of a single dominant @xmath61 allowing the reactions @xmath62 . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "the analysis will be performed explicitly for the @xmath63 coupling , since it corresponds to the hard subprocess @xmath64 which offers the highest partonic luminosity .",
    "we will take @xmath63=0.09 , the upper value allowed by indirect bound : @xmath65 @xcite for a squark mass of 100  gev . a quantitative discussion will be given below for the general case of a single dominant @xmath61 coupling constant .",
    "we will not treat explicitly the @xmath66 couplings which are associated to the @xmath58-@xmath67 production , since the low - energy bounds on these couplings are rather more stringent than the constraints on @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "however , the three - leptons analysis from sneutrino production should give similar sensitivities on the @xmath66 and @xmath68 couplings since isolation cuts will be included in the selection criteria for the leptons .",
    "we will not perform the analysis of the @xmath69 couplings which correspond to the @xmath58-@xmath70 production .",
    "a technique for mass reconstruction in the atlas detector using the hadronic decays of the @xmath71 has been demonstrated in @xcite . the detailed experimental analysis needed to extract",
    "a signal is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "besides , in this case the sneutrino and chargino mass reconstruction studied in section [ secana ] is spoiled by the neutrinos produced in the @xmath71 decay .      in order to establish the set of models in which the analysis presented below can be performed , we need to study the variations of the single chargino production rate @xmath72 with the mssm parameters .    in figure  [ mssmu ] , we present the cross - sections for the @xmath73-@xmath74 production through several @xmath68 couplings as a function of the @xmath49 parameter for the fixed values : @xmath75=1.5 , @xmath76  gev , and @xmath77  gev . for this choice of parameters and",
    "independently of @xmath49 , the chargino @xmath78 is lighter than the @xmath79 . in this case",
    "the contributions of squark exchange in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels are negligible compared to the resonant process so that the @xmath73-@xmath74 production cross - section does not depend on the squark mass .",
    "the values for the considered coupling constants have been conservatively taken equal to the low - energy limits for a sfermion mass of @xmath80  gev @xcite .",
    "the cross - sections scale as @xmath81 . + we see on this figure that the dependence of the rates on @xmath49 is smooth for @xmath82 .",
    "this is due to the weak dependence of the @xmath73 mass on @xmath49 in this domain .",
    "in contrast , we observe a strong decrease of the rate in the region @xmath83 where the @xmath73 chargino is mainly composed by the higgsino .",
    "most of the small @xmath84 domain ( @xmath85 smaller than @xmath86  gev for @xmath87 and @xmath88  gev ) is however excluded by the present lep limits  @xcite .",
    "+ we also show as a dashed line on the plot the rate for the @xmath89-@xmath74 production through the @xmath90 coupling .",
    "the decrease of the @xmath89 production rate with increasing @xmath85 is due to an increase of the @xmath89 mass .",
    "we will not consider the contribution to the three - leptons final state from the @xmath89 production since the rate becomes important only for a very limited range of small @xmath85 values not yet excluded by lep data .",
    "figure  [ mssmu ] also allows to compare the sensitivities that can be reached on various @xmath91 couplings using the single chargino production .",
    "if we compare for instance the cross - sections of the @xmath73 production via @xmath90 and @xmath92 at @xmath93  gev , we can see that for equal values of the couplings the ratios between the cross - sections associated to @xmath90 and @xmath92 is @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity that can be obtained on @xmath92 is only @xmath95 times weaker than the sensitivity on @xmath90 , for a @xmath96  gev sneutrino .",
    "note that the cross - section ratio , and hence the scaling to be applied , in order to infer from the reach on @xmath97 the sensitivity on another coupling @xmath91 , depends on the sneutrino mass .",
    "the reason is that the evolution of the parton densities with the @xmath98-bjorken variable is different for sea quark and valence quark and for different quark flavours .    in order to study the dependence of the cross - section on the masses of the involved sparticles ,",
    "the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath47 were varied , and the other model parameters affecting the cross - section were fixed at the values : @xmath99 , @xmath93  gev and @xmath100 . the cross - section for @xmath101-@xmath74 production as a function of @xmath102 and @xmath103 is shown in figure  [ mssmxse ] .",
    "since the @xmath101 mass is approximately equal to @xmath47 as long as @xmath104 , and becomes equal to @xmath105 for @xmath106 , we studied @xmath107 masses between 100 and 950 gev , and values of @xmath47 between 100 and 500  gev . for increasing @xmath102 the cross - section decreases due to a reduction of the partonic luminosity .",
    "a decrease of the cross - section is also observed for @xmath103 approaching @xmath102 , since the phase space factor of the decay @xmath108 following the resonant sneutrino production is then suppressed . in the region",
    "@xmath109 , the chargino production still receives contributions from the @xmath110 channel exchange of a virtual sneutrino , as well as from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels squark exchange which in that case also contribute significantly .",
    "however , in this phase space domain where the resonant sneutrino production is not accessible , the cross - section is considerably reduced .",
    "finally , the single chargino production rate depends weakly on the @xmath111 trilinear couplings .",
    "indeed , only the @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels squark exchange , varying with the squark mass which can be influenced by @xmath111 , depends on these couplings .",
    "the dependence of the rate on the @xmath112 parameter is also weak .",
    "we calculate the total three leptons rate by multiplying the single chargino cross - section by the chargino branching ratio , since we neglect the width of the chargino .",
    "the three - leptons final state is generated by the cascade decay @xmath43 , @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath114 , the chargino decays mainly into a real or virtual @xmath115 and a @xmath116 and hence its branching fraction for the decay into leptons ( lepton=@xmath117 ) is @xmath118 . in particular kinematic configurations ,",
    "the modes can compete with the gauge couplings , affecting the @xmath101 branching fractions .",
    "however , this does not happen as long as the chargino is sufficiently heavier than the neutralino , as is the case for example in supergravity inspired models .",
    "when @xmath41 is the lsp , the branching ratio @xmath119 ranges between @xmath120 and @xmath121 . for values of @xmath85",
    "much smaller than @xmath47 the other allowed decay @xmath122 becomes dominant , spoiling the three - leptons signature .",
    "the analysis strategy is based on the exploitation of the decay chain : which presents a sequence of three decays which can be fully reconstructed .",
    "the strong kinematic constraint provided by the masses of the three sparticles in the cascade is sufficient to reduce the contribution of the different background sources well below the signal rate .",
    "the signal events were generated with a version of the susygen montecarlo  @xcite modified to allow the generation of @xmath123 processes .",

    "+ for this set of mssm parameters , the masses of the relevant gauginos are : @xmath132 and the @xmath73 decay into an on shell @xmath115 has a branching ratio of order @xmath133 .",
    "the total cross - section for the resonant sneutrino production @xmath134 is 37  pb . if we include the branching fractions into the three leptons , the cross - section is 3.3  pb , corresponding to @xmath135 events for the standard integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath136 for the first three years of lhc data taking .",
    "the signal is characterised by the presence of three isolated leptons and two jets . for the initial sample selection",

    "the efficiency for these cuts , after the branching fractions have been taken into account , is @xmath147 , where half of the loss comes from requiring three isolated leptons , and the other half is the loss of jets from @xmath116 decay either because they are not reconstructed , or because the two jets from the decay are reconstructed as a single jet .",

    "we show in figure  [ plmass ] the curves of equal mass for @xmath107 and @xmath101 for @xmath186 calculated with the isasusy @xcite package which uses one - loop rge to get the susy spectrum from the msugra parameters .",
    "the signal reach can be easily evaluated from the sparticle mass spectrum and branching fractions by using the parameterization of the analysis efficiency shown in figure  [ pleff ] .      in the case of a well constrained model as msugra",
    ", the susy background can in principle be evaluated in each considered point in the parameter space . for this evaluation the full susy sample",
    "must be generated for each point , requiring the generation of a large number of events .",
    "the sparticle masses for the model studied in detail in section  [ analysis ] uniquely define a model in the msugra framework .",
    "therefore , as a first approach to the problem , a full analysis was performed for this model , corresponding to the parameter values : @xmath187    for this msugra point , the mass scale for squarks / gluinos is in the proximity of 500  gev , and the total cross - section for all the susy particles pair productions is approximately 130  pb , yielding a signal of events for the first three years of data - taking at the lhc . a total of 400k events were generated and analysed .",
    "the number of surviving events after cuts in the three - muons sample was @xmath188 for an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath136 .",
    "all the background events come from direct chargino and neutralino production , as it was the case for the mssm point studied in section  [ seclam ] . as a cross - check",
    ", we generated for the same msugra point only the processes of the type @xmath189 , where @xmath190 denotes either @xmath191 or @xmath192 , and @xmath193 any other susy particle .",
    "the cross - section is in this case , and the number of background events is @xmath194 events , in good agreement with the number evaluated generating all the susy processes .    based on this result , we have performed a scan in the @xmath185 plane the fixed values @xmath186 , @xmath195 . on a grid of points we generated event samples for",
    "the @xmath189 processes with the herwig 6.0 montecarlo  @xcite .",
    "the number of susy events with a @xmath49-jet - jet combination with an invariant mass within 15  gev of the @xmath116 mass is shown in figure  [ plback ] in the @xmath185 plane for an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath136 .",
    "the background is significant for a @xmath101 mass of 175  gev ( @xmath196200  gev ) , and becomes essentially negligible for @xmath101 mass of 260  gev ( @xmath196300  gev ) .",
    "this behaviour is due to the combination of two effects : the @xmath197 production cross - section decreases with increasing @xmath58 mass , and the probability of losing two of the four jets from the decay of the two @xmath116 in the event becomes very small for a @xmath101 mass of @xmath198  gev .",
    "indeed , the suppression of the susy background is mainly due to the jet veto cut .    given the high susy cross - section , and the high lepton multiplicity from @xmath116 decays , a prominent signal should manifest itself through r - conserving sparticle pair production in this scenario .",
    "single resonant sneutrino production will then be used as a way of extracting information on the value of the @xmath17-violating coupling constant , and of precisely measuring the masses of @xmath199 , @xmath101 , @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , thanks to the very high number of produced @xmath116 expected from @xmath200 pair production , the @xmath116 mass will be directly reconstructed from @xmath201 and @xmath202 decays , as shown in @xcite .",
    "so , for the present analysis it can be assumed that the @xmath116 mass is approximately known , and an attempt to reconstruct the @xmath101 peak can be performed even if the @xmath116 reconstruction does not yield a significant peak over the susy+sm background . in order to perform the full reconstruction ,",
    "one just needs to observe a statistically significant excess of events over what is expected from the standard model background in the mass region corresponding to the known @xmath116 mass .",
    "the full kinematic reconstruction described in section  [ secana ] above will then easily allow to separate the process of interest from the susy background .",
    "based on the discussion in the previous section we calculate the signal significance as @xmath203 , where for the signal @xmath20 we only consider the resonant sneutrino production , and for the background @xmath19 we only consider the sm background .",
    "we show in figure  [ plreach ] for @xmath186 and for the two signs of @xmath49 the regions in the @xmath185 plane for which the signal significance exceeds 5@xmath204 and the number of signal events is larger than 10 , for an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath136 .",
    "the reach is shown for three different choices of the @xmath205 parameter : @xmath206 .",
    "even for the lowest considered coupling the signal can be detected in a significant fraction of the parameter space .",
    "the dotted line shows the region below which the @xmath101 decays to the @xmath116 and a virtual @xmath115 , thus making the kinematic reconstruction of the decay chain described in section  [ secana ] impossible .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath116 is however still possible , but the reconstruction efficiency drops rapidly due to the difficulty to separate the two soft jets from the @xmath116 decay .",
    "a detailed study involving careful consideration of jet identification algorithms is needed to assert the lhc reach in that region .    as observed in @xcite ,",
    "the efficiencies quoted for this analysis rely on a branching ratio of @xmath207 for the decay @xmath208 .",
    "this is in general true in sugra models as long as the @xmath209 is heavier than the @xmath101 , corresponding to moderate values for @xmath75 . for high @xmath75 ,",
    "the decay @xmath210 can become kinematically possible , and its branching ratio can dominate the standard @xmath208 .",
    "the stau in turns typically decays as @xmath211 .",
    "the three - leptons signature is in this case even enhanced , due to the higher branching fraction into electrons and muons for the @xmath71 compared to the @xmath115 , at the price of a softer lepton spectrum .",
    "the @xmath116 reconstruction is still possible but the presence of three neutrinos ( two additional neutrinos come from the leptonic @xmath71 decay ) renders the reconstruction of the particles earlier in the decay chain difficult .",
    "the analysis efficiency is essentially unaffected with respect to the low @xmath75 case as long as the mass difference between the @xmath209 and the @xmath116 is larger than @xmath212  gev .",
    "for @xmath209 and @xmath116 masses too much degenerate , the transverse momentum of the charged lepton coming from the @xmath71 decay would often fall below the analysis requirements , leading thus to a reduction of the signal efficiency .",
    "the reach in the @xmath185 plane is shown in figure  [ plreach35 ] for @xmath213 and three different choices of the @xmath90 coupling . the branching fraction for the decay",
    "@xmath210 is higher than 50@xmath148 to the left of the dotted line , and the region for which a reduced signal efficiency is expected is displayed as a grey area .",
    "the reach for @xmath116 detection is similar to the low @xmath75 case , but the region in which the full reconstruction of the sneutrino decay chain is possible is severely restricted .",
    "we have analysed the resonant sneutrino production at lhc in supersymmetric models with r - parity violation .",
    "we have focused on the three - leptons signature which has a small standard model background , and allows a model - independent mass reconstruction of the full sneutrino decay chain .",
    "a detailed study for an example mssm point has shown that the mass reconstruction analysis has an efficiency of a few percent , and that a precise measurement of the masses of @xmath107 , @xmath101 , @xmath116 can be performed .",
    "both the standard model background and the backgrounds from other susy pair productions were studied in detail , and shown to be well below the expected signal for a value of the considered coupling @xmath205 taken at the present low - energy limit .    the trilepton signal from sneutrino production",
    "was then studied as a function of the model parameters under different model assumptions , and sensitivity over a significant part of the parameter space was found . within the mssm",
    ", the production of a 900  gev sneutrino for @xmath2 , and of a 350  gev sneutrino for @xmath3 can be observed in the first three years of lhc running . in the framework of the msugra model ,",
    "the region in the @xmath185 space accessible to the analysis was mapped as a function of the value of the @xmath17-violating coupling for representative values of @xmath75 .",
    "a significant part of the @xmath185 plane will be accessible for @xmath3 .",
    "although the detailed study was focused on the case of a single dominant @xmath205 coupling , we have found that the resonant sneutrino production analysis can bring interesting sensitivities on all the couplings of the type @xmath214 , compared to the low - energy constraints .",
    "the resonant sneutrino production should also allow to test most of the @xmath215 coupling constants .",
    "in conclusion we have demonstrated that if minimal supersymmetry with r - parity violation is realised in nature , the three - leptons signature from sneutrino decay will be a privileged channel for the precision measurement of sparticle masses and for studying the susy parameter space , over a broad spectrum of models .",
    "analyses based on the study of events including three leptons , were often advocated in the literature @xcite-@xcite as a particularly sensitive way of attacking the search for susy at the lhc in the standard r - conserving scenario . the higher lepton multiplicity and the possibility to perform precise measurements of the model parameters make this kind of analyses an even more attractive possibility in the case of r - parity violation with dominant @xmath216 couplings .",
    "this work was initiated during a workshop held in les houches .",
    "we warmly thank patrick aurenche and all of the organising team for the stimulating program , the excellent atmosphere and the outstanding computing facilities .",
