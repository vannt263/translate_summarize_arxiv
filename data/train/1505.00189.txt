    "micro - cantilevers are the most widely deployed micro - mechanical system ( mems ) , initially developed for atomic force microscopy  @xcite , but now serving as ultra - sensitive force transducers for applications ranging from airbag release to motion detection in mobile telephones .",
    "they have enabled nanobiotechnology  @xcite , branching beyond imaging into single - molecule manipulation and force metrology  @xcite , as well as multifunctional lab - on - a - tip  @xcite techniques .",
    "cantilevers are promising for future medical diagnostic devices because they are both sensitive , with unlabeled biomolecules detected down to femtomolar concentrations within minutes  @xcite , and because they can be multiplexed on arrays that allow multiple simultaneous differential measurements@xcite .",
    "the biochemical sensitivity of cantilevers derives from the ability to detect small motions of their untethered ends , usually via the optical beam deflection technique ( obdt )  @xcite implemented extensively for afm - like devices .",
    "while conceptually simple , the need for careful alignment by specialists and a laser spot size small compared to the dimensions of the cantilevers limit general applicability outside of specialized research laboratories as well as the miniaturization needed both for enhanced sensitivity and massive multiplexing .",
    "one reason for the preeminence of obdt is that when the first atomic force microscopes were developed 30 years ago , inexpensive digital imaging ( di ) was unavailable . in this paper , we describe how cheap di enables a much more robust method , namely far field diffractive imaging , for optical readout of cantilever arrays .",
    "the method operates with light beams which can be much larger than individual cantilevers and whose angle of incidence and reflection need not be precisely set and measured , thus removing the obstacles presented by obdt for non - expert use , miniaturization and multiplexing , and thus opening optically read- out cantilever arrays to numerous applications outside specialist research laboratories .",
    "it relies on the interference fringes easily visible for all objects with features on the scale of the wavelength of light , and we illustrate it for ordinary cantilevers , where the fringes are derived from their edges , as well as cantilevers into which we have inserted  using focused ion beam prototyping - periodic arrays of slots to create gratings whose diffraction patterns are very sensitive to bending .",
    "the paper starts with a mathematical description of the interference effects associated with all optical readouts of cantilever bending , and then describe our tests of the diffractive method for unpatterned and patterned cantilevers , first for remote temperature sensing and then for biomedicine , where we examine antibiotic action .    ) ) . *",

    "* f * , the projected profile is symmetric as is therefore also the sensitivity curve .",
    "* c * , non - ideal case , the cantilever edges are illuminated causing * e * , a cross - shaped diffraction patter projected onto the spit photo - detector .",
    "* g * , the projected profile as well as the sensitivity curve are asymmetric.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "optical techniques for mems metrology require the illumination of a region or all of the device probed .",
    "we focus our attention on the details of obdt depicted in figure  [ fig : obdt - diffraction]a , whose operation consists of reflecting a focused or collimated light beam from the free end of a cantilever and measuring the position of the reflection projected onto a segmented photo - diode or similar position - sensitive device .",
    "we model the optical system using the huygens - fresnel principle , where the light re - emitted by the cantilever , both reflected or transmitted , can be understood as the summation of an infinite number of infinitesimal point sources located on the cantilever surface .",
    "a cantilever acts as a rectangular slit source in the plane @xmath0 and under fresnel s approximation the optical wave in the observing plane @xmath1 is given by  @xcite    @xmath2 } d\\xi d\\eta.\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the function defining the amplitude and phase at the re - emitting source , defined by the illuminating profile and the geometry of the device .",
    "the beam projected onto the device is typically assumed to be radially symmetric around its maximum , in our case we assume a 2d gaussian illumination centred in the origin , @xmath4 .      in the ideal case of a",
    "perfectly flat , infinite reflecting surface , the incident beam will be reflected unperturbed into a detector , maintaining the original profile .",
    "we model the finite size of the detector and consider the gaussian beam projected on a photodiode and calculate that the differential signal of the segmented sensor versus beam displacement is ( see supplementary material for derivation of exact solution , approximations , analysis , and figures )    @xmath5\\ ] ]    where the factor @xmath6 is proportional to the laser intensity and the electronic gain , @xmath7 is the distance of the centre of the beam from the centre of the detector , @xmath8 the standard deviation of the gaussian beam at the detector , is the error function , @xmath9 is the length of the photodiode segments and @xmath10 is the distance between these segents ( see figure 1 for graphical definitions of @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "the approximation @xmath12 implies maximum gain and linearity ; and it is valid within 1% only if @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "we observe in equation  ( [ eq : gain ] ) that a smaller spot size @xmath8 appears to increase the gain , as previously reported  @xcite , but it must be noted that this is true only if @xmath11 is much smaller than @xmath8 . because the signal is linear within 1% only for @xmath15 a small spot size will also restrict the dynamic range .    for beams",
    "not collimated but focused at a finite distance , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the detector distance , @xmath19 is the cantilever deflection angle , and @xmath20 the beam divergence ) and therefore the signal @xmath21 is independent of @xmath18 and is maximized by reducing the beam divergence @xmath20 . considering that the minimum beam cross - section diameter is given by , we see that a small beam divergence determines the minimum size of the laser spot and consequently the minimum width of the cantilever , if diffraction is to be avoided , as we will see",
    ".      the infinite plane model could only be valid if the reflected beam cross - section is completely contained in a flat reflecting surface ( figure  [ fig : obdt - diffraction]b ) , otherwise any illuminated edge of the cantilever ( figure  [ fig : obdt - diffraction]c ) will cause a diffraction pattern to appear on the photo - detector .    to model the influence of a finite cantilever we first separate variables using @xmath22 and concentrate attention on the longitudinal axes @xmath23,@xmath24 .",
    "we now introduce an edge at position @xmath25 , and re - define @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the heaviside step function , @xmath28 to obtain :    @xmath29    where @xmath24 is the coordinate along the cantilever , @xmath23 along the detector , @xmath30 is the illumination wavelength , @xmath31 the position of the cantilever edge and @xmath8 the standard deviation of the gaussian beam",
    ".     +    figure  [ fig : obdt - diffraction]d and  [ fig : obdt - diffraction]e shows calculated diffraction patterns caused by a gaussian beam reflected from cantilevers with edges respectively far and close to the beam centre . illuminating the cantilever s edge causes a broad - tailed asymmetric diffraction pattern , significantly different from the typically assumed gaussian intensity distribution .",
    "this diffraction artifact causes an asymmetric dependence of the measured signal on the cantilever deflection , as shown in figure  [ fig : signalcurveandresidue]a .",
    "the artifact is negligible for controlled systems , where a feed - back loop maintains the cantilever bending at a small constant value and the excursions from this value are small during experimentation .",
    "interestingly , the asymmetry of the sensitivity could become relevant for uncontrolled systems , such as bio - markers , and systems where calibration and measurement happens at opposite sides of the deflection curve .",
    "for instance in single - molecule force - spectroscopy experiments where signal versus cantilever bending calibration curves are obtained from upward - bending ( pushing the cantilever into the surface ) long trajectories whereas sample measurements are downward - bending for a pulling experiment.@xcite figure  [ fig : signalcurveandresidue]b shows the normalized difference between considering or neglecting diffraction , implying that bending could be under or overestimated by more than 10% .    we have seen that the ideal case for obdt is the limit when the illuminating beam is much smaller than the cantilever . in practice ,",
    "small numerical aperture systems create focal spots comparable in size to cantilever widths ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "carefully aligning and focusing a small laser spot onto the centre of a cantilever end , to avoid the diffraction caused by the edges , can become a tedious task , if at all possible .",
    "we investigate the opposite limit , when the illuminated area is much bigger than the cantilever , and the diffraction pattern caused by the finite cantilever size contain all the information we need .",
    "now we demonstrate that the shape of the diffraction pattern reveals the details of a surface curvature .",
    "figure  [ fig : method ] shows a cartoon of two operational modes of the new proposed readout method .",
    "a broad laser source illuminates the whole cantilever with close to homogeneous intensity while a ccd or cmos detector captures some of the diffraction fringes created by either reflected or transmitted light  @xcite .",

    "therefore , tracking the changes in position and shape of a diffraction pattern enables to monitor the tilt and curvature of the cantilever independently .",
    "this result holds for different cantilever shapes @xmath47 in reflection mode .    to model the transmission mode",
    ", we took a step back and considered the fresnel approximation not in a plane but from a curved source . according to the huygens - fresnel principle the field intensity is given by  @xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the distance from the virtual source point at @xmath50 and the observation at @xmath51 .",
    "we consider a source curved on @xmath24 , @xmath52 and follow similar procedure as before but with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "we approximate @xmath54 up to second order in the numerator exponent and re - arrange to complete squares    @xmath55    where the zero order term @xmath56 will later cancel with its complex conjugate when calculating the intensity and    @xmath57    to the extent that @xmath58 we can neglect the terms containing @xmath23 in the right hand side and recover a similar result as before , this time only for small changes in cantilever tilt and curvature , implying a pattern shift of @xmath59 , pattern magnification of @xmath60 respectively .",
    "these magnitudes differ from the previous result by a factor of two because , for a given cantilever displacement , light travels the path only once in transmission mode but twice in reflection mode .",

    "an interesting consequence of our analysis is that , where the approximations hold , the principle of diffraction readout applies independent of the form @xmath47 of the cantilever , particularly it applies also to a periodic array of slits .",
    "we performed a second experiment with a cantilever featuring a series of narrow slits created by the focused ion beam technique as shown in figure  [ fig : experiment2]b . here the light transmitted through the array of slits causes an intense series of bragg peaks ( figure  [ fig : experiment2]c , figure  [ fig : exptrans]a ) with spacing reciprocal in relation to the spacing of the slits .",
    "the weaker fraunhofer peaks between the bragg peaks result from the finite number of slits .",
    "more slits will increase the number of fraunhofer fringes and decrease their intensity .",
    "the entire feature - rich pattern is sensitive to the phase differences caused by cantilever deflection and consequently , contrary to other techniques , a patterned cantilever allows the detection of bending across a broad range of detection angles .    to further test the method in challenging conditions of practical interest we reproduce previous results on binding of antibiotics to target peptides.@xcite un - patterned cantilevers were either sensitized or passivated by selectively forming a self - assembled molecular monolayer by incubating them individually in micro - capillary tubes .",
    "passive control cantilevers were coated with polyethylene glycol ( peg ) and target cantilevers were coated with drug - sensitive mucopeptide analogue in a procedure detailed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : vancotrace]a shows bending of cantilevers coated with a bio - mimetic bacterial cell wall target in response to 250@xmath76 m vancomycin detected with both the diffractive method and obdt . upon repetition at different vancomycin concentrations we obtain the saturation curves in figures  [ fig : vancotrace]b - c featuring identical dissociation constants , irrespective of the detection method .",
    "diffraction features generated by a microstructure such as a cantilever are exquisitely sensitive to geometrical details such as curvature , tilt , position of the edges and roughness of the surface.@xcite we have shown that this sensitivity , depending on details , can on one hand yield artefacts that skew assumed calibrations of obdt . on the other hand , they provide alternative means for detecting independently changes of tilt or curvature .",
    "avoiding diffraction from the cantilever surface requires comparatively narrow illuminating beams or broad flat reflection areas .",
    "if it exists at all , the optimum position and focus of the illuminating beam will tend to be narrow , and therefore continuous and tedious re - alignment and re - calibration could be necessary .",
    "another common problem of highly focused laser beams in liquid is that the measured intensity becomes sensitive to transient perturbations caused by aggregates or other impurities crossing the beam at the narrow focus , be they suspended in the liquid or diffusing in the cantilever surface .",
    "there are several advantages to be gained by measuring the details of diffraction patterns , instead of trying to avoid them .",
    "keeping the laser spot larger than the cantilever dimensions makes exact knowledge of the laser spot position@xcite superfluous and therefore alignment becomes a fast , simple and reliable procedure .",
    "a broad illumination beam also minimizes the relative magnitude of perturbations caused by particles crossing the illumination beam and eliminates temperature gradients in the cantilever  @xcite .",
    "the optical diffractive readout does not necessarily rely on having a reflective surface and therefore the choice of surface coatings is widened",
    ". beside the reflection component , cantilevers featuring slit arrays allow high signal - to - noise levels in transmission mode , and more interestingly , the detector can be located off - axis around high order bragg peaks , offering a much broader set of geometrical configurations for the detector .",
    "the relative change in size of the diffraction pattern is of particular interest because it is invariant to lateral translation and rotation and independent of the shift caused by changes in tilt , making the measurement intrinsically robust to small perturbations in the detector and cantilever positions and orientations .",
    "we have provided an exact analytical model for parabolic bending and reflection mode and an approximate analytical solution for transmission mode when @xmath58 .",
    "we have also defined a figure of merit ( fom ) that allows an effective implementation of the detection technique independent of these analytical considerations or other modelling .",
    "the high order bragg fine structure resembles that exploited for oversampled x - ray crystallography@xcite .",
    "we have a visible light analog of the x - ray experiments and here the information from the phase difference created by the cantilever curvature is contained in the details of the intensity between bragg peaks .",
    "measuring the details of a diffraction pattern requires a more complex detection device such as a ccd or cmos sensor array , as opposed to a simpler split photodiode .",
    "this increase in complexity is justified by the increased amount of information available , as tilt and bending could be decoupled .",
    "ccd and cmos sensor also feature reduced bandwidth , but this is not a limitation for probing systems with relevant time scales much longer than the ccd frame acquisition period , such as the ones shown here .",
    "it is also worth noting that the ubiquity of digital imaging today , especially as compared to when obdt was developed in the early 1990s , makes the use of position - sensitive optical detection a very competitive option for modern low - cost instrumentation .",
    "the presented far - field technique distinguishes itself from the related nanobe  @xcite in that it does not demand a lens to maintain the near field condition and allows a transmission mode at wide angles . at the far field ,",
    "if more than one cantilever is illuminated at a time , the observed diffraction pattern will be sensitive to the differential displacement , while in the near field there is negligible overlap from the information from near cantilevers .    in summary , we have analysed mathematically the popular optical beam deflection technique ( obdt ) for measuring cantilever deflection and found that the conditions for maximum gain , linearity and symmetry require illumination spot sizes that are heavily constrained by the geometry of the detector and the cantilever , desired dynamic range and gain , and the divergence of the illuminating beam .",
    "ignoring such constraints can cause detection errors in exceed of 10% .",
    "we propose a diffraction readout method which decouples as independent observables the cantilever tilt and curvature of the cantilevers and does not require precise alignment .",
    "the excellent correlation observed ( figure  [ fig : bending]g ) between the obdt and our proposed diffraction method demonstrates the advantages of replacing obdt with the more robust diffraction method .",
    "we have demonstrated the fundamental principles and practicality of our approach both analytically and experimentally for a clinically relevant application .",
    "[ [ readout ] ] readout + + + + + + +    we used a cantilever array chip ( ibm ) where each cantilever was @xmath77 m long , @xmath78 m wide and @xmath79 m thick , and coated with a layer of 2  nm titanium followed by 20  nm of gold .",
    "the array chip was mounted in an aluminium flow cell with sapphire windows at both sides and a thermoelectric peltier element and thermocouple for temperature control . a broad laser beam ( hene 632.8 nm , 5.0 mw , hrr050 thorlabs ) ) illuminates the surface of a single cantilever to test the diffractive readout method .",
    "simultaneously , a narrowly focused laser beam was used to measure the cantilever bending using obdt as control .",
    "both reflected beams were projected onto ccd sensors ( orca - ag from hamamatsu , pixel size : 6.45 @xmath76 m @xmath80 6.45 @xmath76 m and firewire 400 color industrial camera dfk 31af03 with sensor sony icx204ak , pixel size 4.65 @xmath76 m @xmath80 4.65 @xmath76 m ) mounted on calibrated goniometers ( rotation stage rv160cchl and xyz - stage vp-25x from newport ) to allow recording the intensity at different angles .",
    "ccd sensors were approximately at a distance of 100  mm for reflection mode and 250  mm for transmission mode .",
    "our raw data consist of the diffraction patterns generated by the cantilevers captured as 12bit tiff images .",
    "exposure times on the order of milliseconds were adjusted to avoid saturation and maximize dynamic range .",
    "the expansion of the pattern by approximately 12.5% observed in figure  [ fig : experiment]c corresponds to a change in curvature of @xmath81 and a displacement at the end of the cantilever of @xmath82 .",
