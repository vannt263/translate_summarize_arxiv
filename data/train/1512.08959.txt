    "current observations of the cosmic microwave radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , together with the inflationary paradigm , indicate that at the beginning of cosmic inflation the universe was in a pure state with highly - correlated quantum fluctuations .",
    "these correlated quantum fluctuations are imprinted in the cmb sky and correspond to an _ area law _ @xcite for the entanglement entropy of quantum fields .    in this essay",
    "we explore the behavior of entanglement before the beginning of inflation , that is in the primordial universe . in classical general relativity , the belinsky - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite indicates that the spatial coupling of degrees of freedom is suppressed in the approach to a space - like singularity . in the quantum theory",
    "this phenomenon corresponds to the suppression of correlations at space - like separation , i.e. a suppression of the entanglement entropy .",
    "we consider a class of candidate solutions of the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation that have exactly this behavior : a vanishing entanglement entropy in the limit of small scale factor .",
    "we argue that the dynamics entangles the quantum degrees of freedom of space resulting in a growth of the entanglement entropy with the scale factor : the entanglement entropy grows  following a quantum version of the second law of thermodynamics  until it saturates to an equilibrium state where the area law holds and standard quantum field theory on a classical background geometry applies .",
    "our analysis brings together two independent conceptual insights regarding the nature of time : relational time and the thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "the notion of _ relational time _ is relevant for generally - covariant systems where the parameter time @xmath0 is not an observable @xcite . what a generally - covariant theory predicts and experiments can test is the value of an observable @xmath1 conditioned to having measured the value of another observable @xmath2 . introducing the parameter time @xmath0",
    ", we have the partial observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the prediction @xmath5\\equiv\\mathcal{o}(t(a))$ ] of finding the value @xmath1 given the value @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , we can describe the correlation of the position of a pendulum with the position of a ball rolling down an inclined plane .",
    "this timeless description of the dynamics applies to classical systems as well as to quantum systems as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : time - lessqm ] .",
    "the notion of _ thermodynamic arrow of time _ arises in isolated macroscopic systems where , according to the second law of thermodynamics , the entropy does not decrease in time .",
    "the microscopic foundations of this law rest on boltzmann s statistical explanation of the observed irreversible behavior of macroscopic systems @xcite : the reversible microscopic dynamics of the system typically results in the evolution from low statistical entropy towards the maximum allowed entropy , the equilibrium state .",
    "the argument involves two ingredients : a choice of coarse graining of microscopic degrees of freedom and the preparation of the system in an initial microscopic configuration with low statistical entropy .",
    "for instance , a burning candle is initially in a low - entropy state and the height of the candle can be used to measure a time lapse and its direction . fixing the initial conditions",
    "is what breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it can be argued that to measure the passing of time we need both a pendulum and a candle .",
    "our best clocks have oscillators with all frictions eliminated as far as possible .",
    "a perfect oscillator is one that perfectly conceals the arrow of time , while accurately measuring the length of a given interval of time , proportional to the number of oscillations .",
    "correlations of the position of the pendulum and the height of a burning candle then establish the direction of the flow of time .",
    "both instruments are required if one wants to measure a directed interval of time .",
    "in fact , mechanical watches have this system built in : a good oscillator and an escapement mechanism that is initially in a low - entropy state which introduces a small but necessary dissipation in order to keep track of the number of oscillations , making the hands advance in one direction .",
    "we argue that the primordial universe is no different : the entanglement entropy of a region of space typically grows with the scale factor resulting in an entanglement arrow of time in an isolated and timeless quantum system .    in the next two sections we illustrate the notion of relational time in time - less quantum mechanics ( sec .",

    "[ sec : entanglement-2nd law ] ) .",
    "the application to quantum gravity and its relevance to the description of the pre - inflationary universe is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : wdw ] .",
    "differently from the schrdinger equation , the wheeler - dewitt equation in quantum gravity does not contain a parameter time @xmath0 .",
    "an ordinary quantum mechanical system showing this same behavior is a stationary state , i.e. an eigenstate of the energy @xcite . as an example , consider two uncoupled harmonic oscillators with hamiltonians @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the level of energy @xmath8 of the combined system has finite degeneracy if the frequencies are proportional .",
    "we take @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 a multiple of the integer @xmath12 .",
    "the wdw equation for this simple system reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and the most general solution @xmath15 has the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are eigenstates of each of the two oscillators .",
    "while there is no time in this quantum system , we can still speak about the evolution of the expectation value of an observable conditioned to a value of the other . in the following we discuss the evolution of the expectation value of the position @xmath19 of the second oscillator , conditioned to the value @xmath20 of the position of the first oscillator .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the setting is the standard one of positive - operator valued measures ( povm ) .",

    "the completeness relation reads @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the state of the second oscillator conditioned to the value @xmath25 for the first is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the traces in the hilbert space of each oscillator .",
    "the conditioned value of the position of the second oscillator is @xmath29 .",
    "conditioning the first oscillator to a definite position @xmath20 corresponds to the limit of infinite squeezing of the coherent state @xmath21 , i.e. the limit of a gaussian to a dirac delta function centered at @xmath20 . in this case",
    "we obtain a rather simple formula for the conditioned state : @xmath30 notice that this reduced state is pure : the entanglement between the two oscillators has been exploited in obtaining the conditioned state . the conditioned position @xmath31 of the second oscillator is easily computed .",

    "is compared to its classical counterpart ( dashed line ) .",
    "boltzmann s notion of thermodynamic arrow of time , originally proposed for isolated classical systems , applies to quantum systems in a pure state as well .",
    "the coarse graining of the microscopic degrees of freedom is given by a choice of sub - algebra of observables @xmath33 corresponding to a splitting of the hilbert space of the system in a tensor product @xmath34 .",
    "a pure state @xmath15 restricted to this sub - algebra results in a density matrix @xmath35 that is _ typically _ mixed because of entanglement between @xmath33 and @xmath36 .",
    "the _ entanglement entropy _ is the entropy of measurements of the observables in @xmath33 on the state @xmath15 and is defined as the von neumann entropy of the restricted state @xmath37 . while the schrdinger equation is invariant under time reversal , the evolution of a system initially prepared in a state of low entanglement entropy typically results in an increase of the entanglement entropy towards its value in the equilibrium configuration .",
    "this mechanism provides the foundations of the second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems @xcite and is illustrated below in a toy model .",
    "the toy model consists of a discretized free scalar quantum field .",
    "the system is equivalent to a collection of harmonic oscillators , one at every lattice site and coupled through the discretized laplacian on the lattice .",
    "in particular , the tensor product of the individual oscillator vacua @xmath38 has zero entanglement .",
