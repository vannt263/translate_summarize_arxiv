    "@xcite ) unexpected results can be and indeed are derived .",
    "a recent example is the discovery by one of the authors of the present letter @xcite , that the interaction between a relativistic charge packet and a metal or dielectric surface can become repulsive by simply tuning the packet geometry ; a result that seems to go against common notions established in electrodynamics and should be of importance in the framework of accelerator physics and electron spectroscopy .    in this letter we switch gears and focus on the interaction between a point charge and a uniaxial dielectric within the context of ionic and molecular interactions with macroscopic surfaces .",
    "we assume a description of the surface that approximates the non - isotropic nature of crystalline surfaces and surfaces decorated with adsorbed non - isotropic inclusions .",
    "we present a derivation of the force on the charged particle starting from maxwell s equations in fourier space and then evaluate the force numerically in real space .",
    "we show that the longitudinal component of the force ( parallel to the dielectric surface ) is in general not parallel to the particle velocity anymore and that its direction depends on the particle speed ( energy ) .",
    "we demonstrate two peculiarities of the plasma type response : 1 ) the direction of the longitudinal force depends on the distance of the particle from the surface and 2 ) under specific conditions the particle can be repelled by the surface .",
    "the geometry of the problem is illustrated in fig .",

    "the velocity is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the angle between @xmath0 and the optical axis .",
    "the electromagnetic field due to the moving point charge is calculated from maxwell s equations : @xmath6    the problem is tackled by replacing the fields with the standard scalar and vector potentials defined as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "the longitudinal force @xmath62 can be interpreted in fourier space in a convenient way .",
    "the point particle excites electromagnetic waves in the semiinfinite dielectric and each of these waves carries a momentum proportional to @xmath17 .",

    "the magnitude of the momentum is determined by the boundary conditions and material properties .",
    "the longitudinal force @xmath63 in real space is then obtained by integration over the momenta of all the excited waves .    in the following we treat two examples of dielectric response : a lossless dielectric with no dispersion and a plasma type response .",
    "mathematically both cases can be analyzed using the drude model for the dielectric tensor : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are dielectric constants at high frequencies ( @xmath66 ) , @xmath67 are the plasma frequencies and @xmath68 are the damping coefficients . for a lossless dielectric @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72",

    "the condition of eq .",
    "( [ plasmacondition ] ) therefore reads : @xmath78    in addition to the above , for non - zero losses the plasma model is not applicable near @xmath67 , where the imaginary part of the dielectric function dominates the response .",
    "for a lossless dielectric with no dispersion , i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constants , @xmath81 will be non - zero only if the erenkov condition , either for the ordinary or extraordinary waves ( or both ) , is satisfied .",
    "this occurs when either @xmath48 or @xmath49 becomes imaginary , i.e. the waves become propagating .",
    "if both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real , the waves excited in the solid are evanescent ( they decay exponentially in the solid ) and these do not contribute to @xmath81 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath81 in general decreases the energy of the particle and this can occur only if the charge emits radiation into the dielectric .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath48 becomes imaginary if the particle moves faster than the critical speed : @xmath82 above @xmath83 propagating erenkov waves are emitted into a circular cone defined by : @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the angle between the optical axis and the wave vector @xmath86 k_z)$ ] , and @xmath87 .",
    "the function @xmath88 insures that the energy flow is directed into the dielectric ( propagating waves are actually emitted only into one half of the erenkov cone ) .",
    "the symmetry axis of the ordinary erenkov cone is always parallel to the particle velocity .    for extraordinary waves",
    "the analysis is a bit more cumbersome @xcite .",
    "the critical speed for erenkov emission is : @xmath89 from eq .",
    "( [ cerenkov_ext ] ) it follows that for given @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 there exists a critical angle @xmath93 above which the erenkov condition for extraordinary waves is satisfied : @xmath94    the extraordinary erenkov cone has an elliptical cross section @xcite , which follows from the definition of @xmath49 .",
    "the symmetry axis of the cone lies in the @xmath2 plane and makes an angle @xmath95 with the @xmath3 axis : we write the equation for @xmath49 as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a @xmath100 matrix . in the coordinate system where @xmath99 is diagonal",
    "the equation for @xmath49 defines the extraordinary erenkov cone .",
    "the transformation to this coordinate system involves a rotation by @xmath95 along the @xmath101 axis .",

    "@xmath103    which for @xmath104 and @xmath105 reduces to : @xmath106    for a plasma type dielectric @xmath81 is in general always nonzero , but is appreciable only in a certain frequency range due to condition ( [ plasmacondition ] ) .",
    "this can be seen for the limiting case when @xmath107 and therefore @xmath108 .",
    "if follows that @xmath48 is real for all @xmath54 and there are no ordinary propagating waves . on the other hand @xmath49 is imaginary if the frequency @xmath54 lies between the plasma frequencies @xcite : e.g. , @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",

    "this follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ forcesolution ] ) .",
    "for @xmath93 the waves are emitted only into one direction ( the erenkov cone becomes a line ) ; therefore @xmath122 and @xmath123 are proportional and the ratio @xmath124 is the same as @xmath125 .",
    "the longitudinal force is thus parallel to the symmetry axis of the erenkov cone .",
    "for @xmath126 the direction of @xmath81 departs from that of the cone .",
    "the transverse force @xmath111 is a result of a complex interplay between evanescent and erenkov interactions ( see  @xcite for an explanation of the isotropic case ) ; nevertheless , @xmath111 only slightly varies with @xmath5 ( within 10% in the interval @xmath127 $ ] ) . as in the isotropic case  @xcite",
    ", @xmath111 is always attractive ( negative ) for a point charge ; it can not be made repulsive simply by increasing @xmath92 or changing the dielectric constant .",
    "however , it can become repulsive by replacing the point charge with a transverse line of charge .",
    "for @xmath128 the erenkov condition for extraordinary waves is satisfied for all @xmath5 . for low angles",

    "increasing @xmath5 leads to transition back to the regime @xmath131 .",

    "is split into the erenkov ( dashed ) and evanescent ( dotted ) contributions.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    for higher @xmath92 the erenkov condition for ordinary waves is fulfilled .",
    "these waves contribute to a force in the direction opposite to the particle velocity .",
    "the direction of @xmath81 therefore approaches that of the isotropic case , as demonstrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "we note that for the two extreme points @xmath134 and @xmath135 the longitudinal force always points in the direction opposite to @xmath0 , which follows from the symmetry of the situation .",

    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "for @xmath136 the maximum value of @xmath121 is @xmath137 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath111 ; however , the components become comparable at @xmath138 .    for the reversed situation , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ,",
    "the anisotropy is much less pronounced since with increasing @xmath92 ordinary erenkov waves are excited first and these contribute to a force in the direction opposite to @xmath0 . the effect ( not shown here )",

    "although the conditions for a plasma type dielectric are violated at @xmath143 and near @xmath67 , insuring that @xmath144 and putting the plasma frequencies `` far '' apart ( e.g. , @xmath145 ) , the contribution to the integral around these points is small ( the numerical results are nevertheless exact because we are using the drude model for integration ) .",
    "figure  [ fig.4 ] demonstrates that the force direction as well as the magnitude change with @xmath146 . depending on @xmath146 the angle @xmath141 or @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath146 depends on the particle speed @xmath147 and the distance @xmath1 from the dielectric , the force magnitude as well as the force direction also depend on @xmath147 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the case of a dielectric with no losses and no dispersion , where the force direction is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "interesting behavior is observed when @xmath148 , fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] .",
    "the angle @xmath117 is negative for low @xmath5 , which means that the @xmath149 components of the force and velocity have the same sign and the particle is accelerated in the @xmath149 direction .",
    "nevertheless , this does not violate energy conservation because the product @xmath150 and the particle s energy decreases .",
    "peculiar behavior of the transverse force is observed for values of @xmath5 below @xmath151 where it becomes repulsive ( positive ) .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , where we split the interaction into the erenkov part ( @xmath152 ) and the evanescent part ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) . for this particular case",
    "the erenkov contribution , which can become repulsive , starts to dominate for low angles .",
    "the origin of the repulsion is the momentum carried into the dielectric by the excited waves , balanced by the particle  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible for a dielectric surface not only to repel a transverse charge packet as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also a point charge ; an outcome which seems to contradict common notions based on electrostatic considerations of point charges above metallic or dielectric surfaces .",
