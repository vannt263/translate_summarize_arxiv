    "the application of renormalization techniques to quantum gravity theories has always been problematic .",

    "the renormalization group is a tool for dealing with a phenomenon that is inherent to many physical systems with a very large number of degrees of freedom , which are nonlinear , i.e.  exhibit nontrivial self - interaction . to describe such systems ,",
    "it is convenient to not consider all degrees of freedom on an equal footing , but rather to order them according to some hierarchy . this way one considers only a finite and manageable amount of the system at a time .",
    "this hierarchy often runs along a length scale , introducing a notion of `` smaller '' and `` larger '' degrees of freedom .",
    "often the dynamics on different scales are related to each other , in that collective effects of smaller degrees of freedom combine to larger ones .",
    "the non - linearity of the interaction between the small degrees of freedom influences the dynamics of the system on larger scales .",
    "this leads to a scale - dependence of the effective actions for the system , and this `` running of coupling constants '' is a key concept in wilson s approach to the renormalization group @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "one of the key concepts of general relativity is its general covariance , which makes the theory background - independent . in particular , diffeomorphisms of the space - time manifold act as gauge symmetries .",
    "arguably , the corresponding quantum theory should possess the same symmetries .",
    "this makes an easy distinction of `` small '' and `` large '' degrees of freedom difficult , because there is no external geometry to measure any length with .",
    "rather , because geometry itself is dynamical , spatial dimensions become observables , rather than parameters .",
    "the length scales themselves become degrees of freedom , making the applicability of usual renormalization techniques to quantum gravity theories difficult .",

    "this can be done by making an ansatz for the measure , e.g.  in terms of an action function @xmath146    an example for this would be e.g.  the ansatz ( [ eq : examplemeasure ] ) we were using in the example . even more dramatically",
    "would be the restriction to actually finitely many parameters , so that the rg flow equations would be equations for a finite set of coupling constants depending on @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath147 .",
    "the standard rg equations for lattice gauge theory certainly fall into this category .    in the example in section [ sec : example ]",
    "we were able to solve the rg equations ( [ eq : cylindricalconsistency ] ) within this ansatz . in most interesting cases",
    "this will not be possible .",
    "one of the reasons for that is that any non - topological exact solution to the rg flow equations will necessarily generate non - local couplings @xcite , with the 2d heat kernel being one of the very few exceptions to this rule . in particular ,",
    "any ansatz which factorizes over the constituents of the @xmath1-complexes , as is the case with e.g.  all present spin foam models , will not be an exact solution to the rg flow equations , because it will not include non - local couplings .",
    "however , one can still look for approximate solutions in a realm in which non - local couplings are small , and restrict the flow to the space of measures parametrized as ( [ eq : measureansatz ] ) , by demanding that the error @xmath148    is small , with @xmath149 if one chooses @xmath150 to be the supremum norm on @xmath151 , then ( [ eq : approximatergflowequation ] ) is just the minimization of the operator norm of the difference of linear functionals corresponding to the measures @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively , via the riesz representation theorem . by varying this norm one can weigh the errors on some observables to be more severe than on others , introducing more freedom in the procedure .",

    "of course , this approximation might lead to solutions which are very far away from an actual solution , if the space of measures is restricted too strongly .",
    "just as in the frg approach , though , one can make a truncation to few parameters , and hope to find nontrivial , i.e.  interacting , uv fixed points of the action .",
    "afterwards , one can enlarge the parameter space and check whether the characteristic fixed point is stable .",
    "this has led to quite some success in that approach , so that one can hope that similar procedures can also work for spin foam models .",
    "it should also be noted that , due to the specific nature of this approximation , one can suppress non - local couplings by specifically excluding them from the ansatz for the partial measures @xmath51 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the migdal - kadanoff approximation within lattice gauge theory @xcite , and the highest eigenvalue approximation within tensor network renormalization .",
    "it would be very interesting to compare these methods with the one presented here , and we hope to come back to this point in future work .    [ [ example ] ]",

    "the embedded @xmath1-complexes take on the meaning of scale , in the sense that they provide a cut - off for degrees of freedom , since they determine a finite - dimensional portion of infinite - dimensional state space .",

    "rather , the continuum theory is equivalent to the collection of all effective theories at all scales .",

    "secondly , it strengthens the hope that the condition of diffeomorphism - invariance will severely restrict the rg flow , so that the non - renormalizability that plagues the perturbative ansatz might not affect the full , background - independent theory .",

    "additionally , the construction of spaces of generalized connections @xmath30 for non - compact groups is an unsolved problem until today .",
    "also , cylindrical consistency alone will not guarantee the existence of the continuum measure , as the conditions for kolmogorov s theorem are not automatically satisfied , as in the compact case @xcite .",
    "even if all these problems might be overcome , it should be noted that , due to the fact that in the lorentzian eprl model all edges are fixed to be of a certain signature , in most cases time - like , such a model seems to essentially fix the causal structure from the outset .",
    "one would expect that the resulting theory only lets the conformal factor fluctuate , which would seem to miss the point of the geometric principles underlying the construction of the eprl amplitude .",
