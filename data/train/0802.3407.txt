    "up to the summer of 1996 , there had been a number of spectacular successes in mirror symmetry . after the pioneering initial work of candelas ,",
    "de la ossa , greene and parkes @xcite which calculated the instanton predictions for the quintic three - fold , batyrev @xcite gave a powerful mirror symmetry construction for calabi - yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties , later generalized by batyrev and borisov @xcite to complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "kontsevich @xcite introduced his notion of stable maps of curves and studied their moduli , setting the stage for a new flowering of enumerative geometry . eventually , this led to the mathematical calculation of gromov - witten invariants for the quintic in varying forms , @xcite . in between ,",
    "a great deal of the structure of mirror symmetry was elucidated by many researchers in both string theory and algebraic geometry .",
    "on the other hand , at that time i had been primarily interested in the geometry of calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "many of the results about mirror symmetry seemed to rely primarily on information about the ambient toric varieties ; in particular , givental s work @xcite and succeeding work by lian , liu and yau @xcite , bertram @xcite and gathmann @xcite always performed calculations on the moduli space of stable maps into @xmath0 rather than the quintic , and in the batyrev - borisov type constructions , while there was a clear combinatorial relationship between the ambient toric varieties , there was no apparent geometric relationship between the calabi - yaus themselves . as a result",
    ", i tended to avoid thinking about mirror symmetry precisely because of this lack of geometric understanding .",
    "this changed dramatically in june of 1996 , when strominger , yau and zaslow @xcite released their paper `` mirror symmetry is @xmath1-duality . ''",
    "they made a remarkable proposal , based on recent ideas in string theory , that for the first time gave a geometric interpretation for mirror symmetry .",
    "let me summarize , very roughly , the physical argument here .",
    "developments in string theory in the mid-1990s had introduced the notion of _ dirichlet branes _ , or @xmath2-branes .",
    "these are submanifolds of space - time , with some additional data , which should serve as a boundary condition for open strings , i.e.  we allow open strings to propagate with their endpoints constrained to lie on a @xmath2-brane . remembering that space - time , according to string theory , looks like @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is ordinary space - time and @xmath5 is a calabi - yau three - fold , we can split a @xmath2-brane into a product of a submanifold of @xmath4 and one on @xmath5 .",
    "it turned out , simplifying a great deal , that there were two particular types of submanifolds on @xmath5 of interest : _ holomorphic _ @xmath2-branes , i.e.  holomorphic submanifolds with a holomorphic line bundle , and _ special lagrangian _",
    "@xmath2-branes , which are _ special lagrangian submanifolds _ with flat @xmath6 bundle :    let @xmath5 be an @xmath7-dimensional calabi - yau manifold with @xmath8 the khler form of a ricci - flat metric on @xmath5 and @xmath9 a nowhere vanishing holomorphic @xmath7-form . then a submanifold @xmath10 is _ special lagrangian _ if it is lagrangian , i.e.   @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and in addition @xmath13 .",
    "the origins of mirror symmetry in physics suggest that if @xmath5 and @xmath14 are a mirror pair of calabi - yau manifolds , then string theory on a compactification of space - time using @xmath5 should be the same as that using @xmath14 , but with certain data interchanged . in the case of @xmath2-branes ,",
    "the suggestion is that the moduli space of holomorphic @xmath2-branes on @xmath5 should be isomorphic to the moduli space of special lagrangian @xmath2-branes on @xmath14 .",
    "now @xmath5 itself is the moduli space of points on @xmath5 .",
    "so each point on @xmath5 should correspond to a pair @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a special lagrangian submanifold and @xmath17 is a flat connection on @xmath18 .    a theorem of mclean @xcite tells us that the tangent space to the moduli space of special lagrangian deformations of a special lagrangian submanifold @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "of course , the moduli space of flat @xmath6-connections modulo gauge equivalence on @xmath18 is the torus @xmath21 . in order for this moduli space to be of the correct dimension , we need @xmath22 , the complex dimension of @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath5 consists of a family of tori which are dual to a family of special lagrangian tori on @xmath14 .",
    "an elaboration of this argument yields the following conjecture :    _ the strominger - yau - zaslow conjecture_. if @xmath5 and @xmath14 are a mirror pair of calabi - yau @xmath7-folds , then there exists fibrations @xmath23 and @xmath24 whose fibres are special lagrangian , with general fibre an @xmath7-torus . furthermore , these fibrations are dual , in the sense that canonically @xmath25 and @xmath26 whenever @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - singular tori",
    ".    i will clarify this statement as we review the work of the past ten years ; however , as i have stated this conjecture , it is likely to be false . on the other hand ,",
    "there are weaker versions of the conjecture which probably are true .",
    "even better , these weaker statements are probably within reach of modern - day technology ( with a lot of hard work ) .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a lot of good progress on precise versions of the above conjecture at the topological and symplectic level .",
    "in addition , the conjecture has been successful at explaining many features of mirror symmetry , some of which are still heuristic and some of which are rigorous .",
    "it is my belief that a final satisfactory understanding of mirror symmetry will flow from the syz conjecture , even if results do not take the form initially suggested by it .",
    "my main goal here is to explain the journey taken over the last ten years .",
    "i want to focus on explaining the evolution and development of the ideas , rather than focus on precise statements . except in the first few sections",
    ", i will give few precise statements .",
    "in those first sections , i will clarify the above statement of the conjecture , and show how it gives a satisfactory explanation of mirror symmetry in the so - called semi - flat case , i.e.  the case when the metric along the special lagrangian fibres is flat .",
    "this leads naturally to a discussion of affine manifolds , metrics on them , and the legendre transform .",
    "these now appear to be the key structures underlying mirror symmetry .",
    "we next take a look at the case when singular fibres appear . in this case",
    "we need to abandon the precise form of duality we developed in the semi - flat case and restrict our attention to topological duality . in the realm of purely topological duality",
    ", the syz conjecture has been entirely successful at explaining topological features of mirror symmetry for a large range of calabi - yau manifolds , including those produced by the batyrev - borisov construction for complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "moving on , we take a look at dominic joyce s arguments demonstrating the problems with the strong form of the syz conjecture stated above .",
    "this forces us to recast the syz conjecture as a limiting statement .",
    "mirror symmetry is always about the behaviour of calabi - yau manifolds near maximally unipotent degenerations .",
    "a limiting form of the syz conjecture suggests that one can find special lagrangian tori on calabi - yau manifolds near a maximally unipotent degeneration , and as we approach the limit point in complex moduli space , we expect to see a larger portion of the calabi - yau manifold filled out by special lagrangian tori .",
    "unlike the original syz conjecture , though still difficult , this one looks likely to be accessible by current techniques .",
    "this form of the conjecture then motivates a new round of questions . in this limiting picture , we expect the base @xmath29 of the hypothetical special lagrangian fibration to be the so - called gromov - hausdorff limit of a sequence of calabi - yau manifolds approaching the maximally unipotent degeneration .",
    "gromov - hausdorff convergence is a metric space concept , while maximally unipotent degeneration is an algebro - geometric , hodge - theoretic concept .",
    "how do these two concepts relate ? in the summer of 2000 , kontsevich suggested that the gromov - hausdorff limit will be , roughly , the dual intersection complex of the algebro - geometric degeneration , at least on a topological level .",
    "we explore this idea in  6 .    on the other hand ,",
    "how does this help us with mirror symmetry ?",
    "parallel to these developments on limiting forms of the syz conjecture , my coauthor bernd siebert had been studying degenerations of calabi - yau manifolds using logarithmic geometry with stefan schrer .",
    "siebert noticed that mirror symmetry seemed to coincide with a combinatorial exchange of logarithmic data on the one side and polarizations on the other .",
    "together , we realised that this approach to mirror symmetry meshed well with the limiting picture predicted by syz .",
    "synthesizing these two approaches , we discovered an algebro - geometric version of the syz approach , which i will describe here .",
    "the basic idea is to forget about special lagrangian fibrations , and only keep track of the base of the fibration , which is an affine manifold .",
    "we show how polyhedral decompositions of affine manifolds give rise to degenerate calabi - yau varieties , and conversely how certain sorts of degenerations of calabi - yau varieties , which we call _ toric degenerations _ , give rise to affine manifolds as their dual intersection complex .",
    "mirror symmetry is again explained by a discrete version of the legendre transform much as in the semi - flat case .",
    "we end with a discussion of the connection of tropical curves with this approach .",
    "the use of tropical curves in curve counting in two - dimensional toric varieties has been pioneered in work of mihkalkin @xcite ; nishinou and siebert @xcite generalized this work to higher dimensions using an approach directly inspired by the approach i discuss here .",
    "on the other hand , tropical curves have not yet been used for counting curves in calabi - yau manifolds , so i will end the paper by discussing how tropical curves arise naturally in our picture .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the seattle conference for running an excellent conference , and my coauthors pelham wilson and bernd siebert on syz related results ; much of the work mentioned here came out of work with them .",
    "before doing anything else , let s ask a very basic question : why should dualizing torus fibrations interchange hodge numbers of calabi - yau threefolds ? if you havent seen this , it s the first thing one should look at as it is particularly easy to see , if we make a few assumptions .",
    "suppose we are given a pair of calabi - yau threefolds @xmath5 and @xmath14 with fibrations @xmath23 , @xmath24 with the property that there is a dense open set @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are torus fibre bundles .",
    "so all the singular fibres of @xmath33 and @xmath34 lie over @xmath35 .",
    "( note that unless @xmath36 , there must be some singular fibres . ) finally , assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dual torus fibrations , i.e.  @xmath37 can be identified with the torus fibration @xmath39 and @xmath38 can be identified with the torus fibration @xmath40 .",
    "( this is a slight abuse of notation : by @xmath41 we really mean the torus bundle obtained by taking the vector bundle associated to the local system @xmath42 and dividing out by the family of lattices @xmath43 . )",
    "if @xmath44 is a single torus with @xmath45 an @xmath7-dimensional vector space and @xmath46 a lattice in @xmath45 , then @xmath47 , while the dual torus , @xmath48 , has @xmath49 .",
    "if we choose an isomorphism @xmath50 , then we get an isomorphism @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , in the relative setting for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , if we have an isomorphism @xmath52 , we obtain isomorphisms @xmath53 we now make a simplifying assumption .",
    "let @xmath54 be the inclusion .",
    "we will say @xmath33 is _ @xmath55-simple _ if @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "( we can in general replace @xmath55 by any abelian group @xmath58 , and then we say @xmath33 is @xmath58-simple . ) of course , not all torus fibrations are @xmath55-simple , but it turns out that the most interesting ones which occur in the topological form of syz are .",
    "so let s assume @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath55-simple . with this assumption , we obtain isomorphisms @xmath59 we can now use this to study the leray spectral sequence for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "let s make an additional assumption that @xmath5 and @xmath14 are simply connected .",
    "so in particular @xmath29 is simply connected .",
    "let s assume @xmath29 is a three - manifold .",
    "so we have the @xmath60 terms in the leray spectral sequence for @xmath33 : @xmath61 since @xmath5 is simply connected , @xmath62 , from which we conclude that @xmath63 .",
    "the same argument works for @xmath34 , and then ( [ dualityiso ] ) gives @xmath64 and similarly @xmath65 .",
    "finally , consider the possible non - zero maps for the spectral sequence : @xmath66^{d_1}&0&0&{\\mathbb{r}}\\\\ 0&h^1(b , r^2f_*{\\mathbb{r}})&h^2(b , r^2f_*{\\mathbb{r}})&0\\\\ 0&h^1(b , r^1f_*{\\mathbb{r}})\\ar[rrd]^{d_2}&h^2(b , r^1f_*{\\mathbb{r}})&0\\\\ { \\mathbb{r}}&0&0&{\\mathbb{r}}}\\ ] ] we need one further assumption , which is again natural given the duality relationship of @xmath37 and @xmath38 : both @xmath33 and @xmath34 possess sections .",
    "( actually , working over @xmath55 , we just need the existence of cohomology classes on @xmath5 and @xmath14 which evaluate to something non - zero on a fibre of @xmath33 or @xmath34 . )",
    "a section intersects each fibre non - trivially , and hence gives a section of @xmath67 .",
    "since such a section also represents a cohomology class on @xmath5 , @xmath68 must be the zero map .",
    "similarly , a fibre of @xmath33 can not be homologically trivial because it intersects the section non - trivially , and thus the map @xmath69 must be zero .",
    "so the spectral sequence degenerates at @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , we get @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are the hodge numbers of @xmath5 .",
    "thus the third betti number of @xmath14 is @xmath73 , so we see @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "so modulo some assumptions which would of course eventually have to be justified , it is clear , at least in the three - dimensional case , why the hodge numbers are interchanged by duality .",
    "more generally , in any dimension , one might hope that @xmath55-simplicity implies @xmath76 , and then a more general exchange of hodge numbers becomes clear .",
    "see theorem [ hodgedecomp ] for a related result .",
    "this argument can be refined over @xmath77 to make new predictions about the behaviour of _ integral _ cohomology under mirror symmetry . in @xcite ,",
    "theorem 3.10 , it was shown , again in the three - dimensional case , that if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath77-simple and @xmath78-simple , @xmath33 and @xmath34 have sections , and @xmath79 , then @xmath80)&\\cong&h^{odd}(\\check x,{\\mathbb{z}}[1/2])\\\\ h^{odd}(x,{\\mathbb{z}}[1/2])&\\cong&h^{even}(\\check x,{\\mathbb{z}}[1/2]).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are problems in the argument with two - torsion , but it is likely the above isomorphisms hold over @xmath77 .",
    "see @xcite for evidence for this latter conjecture .    enough speculation .",
    "now let s get serious about the structure of special lagrangian fibrations .",
    "the first step in really understanding the syz conjecture is to examine the structures which arise on the base of a special lagrangian fibration .",
    "these structures arise from mclean s theorem on the moduli space of special lagrangian submanifolds @xcite , and these structures and their relationships were explained by hitchin in @xcite .",
    "we outline some of these ideas here .",
    "mclean s theorem says that the moduli space of deformations of a compact special lagrangian submanifold of a compact calabi - yau manifold @xmath5 is unobstructed , with tangent space at @xmath10 special lagrangian canonically isomorphic to the space of harmonic @xmath81-forms on @xmath18 .",
    "this isomorphism is seen explicitly as follows .",
    "let @xmath82 be a normal vector field to @xmath18 in @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath83 and @xmath84 are both seen to be well - defined forms on @xmath18 : one needs to lift @xmath85 to a vector field but the choice is irrelevant because @xmath8 and @xmath86 restrict to zero on @xmath18 .",
    "mclean shows that if @xmath18 is special lagrangian then @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the hodge star operator on @xmath18 , and furthermore , @xmath85 corresponds to an infinitesimal deformation preserving the special lagrangian condition if and only if @xmath89 .",
    "this gives the correspondence between harmonic @xmath81-forms and infinitesimal special lagrangian deformations .",
    "let @xmath23 be a special lagrangian fibration with torus fibres , and assume for now that all fibres of @xmath33 are non - singular .",
    "then we obtain three structures on @xmath29 : two affine structures and a metric , as we shall now see .",
    "[ affine ] let @xmath29 be an @xmath7-dimensional manifold .",
    "an _ affine structure _ on @xmath29 is given by an atlas @xmath90 of coordinate charts @xmath91 , whose transition functions @xmath92 lie in @xmath93 .",
    "we say the affine structure is _ tropical _ if the transition functions lie in @xmath94 , i.e.  have integral linear part .",
    "we say the affine structure is _ integral _ if the transition functions lie in @xmath95 .",
    "if an affine manifold @xmath29 carries a riemannian metric @xmath96 , then we say the metric is _ affine khler _ or _ hessian _ if @xmath96 is locally given by @xmath97 for some convex function @xmath98 and @xmath99 affine coordinates .",
    "then we obtain the three structures as follows :    _ affine structure 1 .",

    "consider the @xmath81-forms @xmath107 on @xmath103 defined by fibrewise integration : @xmath108 for @xmath85 a tangent vector on @xmath29 at @xmath109 , which we can lift to a normal vector field of @xmath27 .",
    "we have @xmath110 , and since @xmath8 is closed , so is @xmath111 .",

    "furthermore , these functions are well - defined up to the choice of basis of @xmath105 and constants . finally , they give well - defined coordinates , as follows from the fact that @xmath113 yields an isomorphism of @xmath114 with @xmath115 by mclean s theorem .",

    "if this compactification is applied to the affine manifolds with singularities described here , the resulting symplectic manifolds should be symplectomorphic to the corresponding toric hypersurface , but this has not yet been shown .",
    "i should also point out that the explicit compactifications mentioned in three dimensions can be carried out in all dimensions , and will be done so in @xcite .",
    "we will show there in a much more general context that these compactifications are then homeomorphic to the expected calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "the previous section demonstrates that the syz conjecture gives a beautiful description of mirror symmetry at a purely topological level .",
    "this , by itself , can often be useful , but unfortunately is not strong enough to get at really interesting aspects of mirror symmetry , such as instanton corrections . for a while ,",
    "though , many of us were hoping that the strong version of duality we have just seen would hold at the special lagrangian level .",
    "this would mean that a mirror pair @xmath333 would possess special lagrangian torus fibrations @xmath23 and @xmath24 with codimension two discriminant locus , and the discriminant loci of @xmath33 and @xmath34 would coincide .",

    "( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , dominic joyce ( @xcite and other papers cited therein ) began studying some three - dimensional @xmath318-invariant examples , and discovered quite different behaviour .",
    "there is an argument that if a special lagrangian fibration is @xmath309 , then the discriminant locus will be ( hausdorff ) codimension two .",

    "in addition , all fibres of this map are special lagrangian , and it is obviously only piecewise smooth . the discriminant locus is the entire plane given by @xmath343 .",
    "this example forces a reevaluation of the strong form of the syz conjecture . in further work joyce found evidence for a more likely picture for general special lagrangian fibrations in three dimensions .",
    "the discriminant locus , instead of being a codimension two graph , will be a codimension one blob .",
    "typically the union of the singular points of singular fibres will be a riemann surface , and it will map to an amoeba shaped set in @xmath29 , i.e.the discriminant locus looks like the picture on the right rather than the left , and will be a fattening of the old picture of a codimension two discriminant .",
    "joyce made some additional arguments to suggest that this fattened discriminant locus must look fundamentally different in a neighbourhood of the two basic types of vertices we saw in the previous section , with the two types of vertices expected to appear pretty much as depicted in the above picture .",
    "thus the strong form of duality mentioned above , where we expect the discriminant loci of the special lagrangian fibrations on a mirror pair to be the same , can not hold .",
    "if this is the case , one needs to replace this strong form of duality with a weaker form .",
    "it seems likely that the best way to rephrase the syz conjecture is in a limiting form .",
    "mirror symmetry as we currently understand it has to do with degenerations of calabi - yau manifolds . given a flat family @xmath345 over a disk @xmath2 , with the fibre @xmath346 over @xmath347 singular and all other fibres @xmath7-dimensional calabi - yau manifolds , we say the family is _ maximally unipotent _ if the monodromy transformation @xmath348 ( @xmath349 non - zero ) satisfies @xmath350 but @xmath351 .",

    "nevertheless , this raises the following natural question .",
    "given a maximally unipotent degeneration of calabi - yau manifolds @xmath364 , take a sequence @xmath365 converging to @xmath347 , and consider a sequence @xmath366 , where @xmath367 is a choice of ricci - flat metric chosen so that @xmath368 remains bounded .",

    "if we take the standard euclidean metric @xmath96 on @xmath372 , then the diameter of @xmath372 is unbounded . to obtain a bounded diameter ,",
    "we replace @xmath96 by @xmath375 ; equivalently , we can keep @xmath96 fixed on @xmath319 but change the periods of the elliptic curve to @xmath376 .",
    "it then becomes clear that the gromov - hausdorff limit of such a sequence of elliptic curves is a circle @xmath377 .",

    ". then we construct the _ discrete legendre transform _",
    "@xmath630 of @xmath629 as follows .",
    "@xmath167 will be constructed by gluing together newton polytopes .",

    "thus we can glue @xmath633 and @xmath634 along this common face . after making all these identifications ,",
    "we obtain a cell complex @xmath572 , which is really just the dual cell complex of @xmath543 .",
    "of course , we have some additional information , namely an affine structure on the interior of each maximal cell of @xmath579 . to give @xmath167 an integral affine structure with singularities , one proceeds as usual , using this affine structure along with an identification of a neighbourhood of each vertex of @xmath579 with the normal fan of the corresponding maximal cell of @xmath255 .",
    "finally , the function @xmath592 has a discrete legendre transform @xmath247 on @xmath572 .",
    "we have no choice but to define @xmath247 in a neighbourhood of a vertex @xmath635 dual to a maximal cell @xmath566 to be a piecewise linear function whose newton polytope is @xmath263 , i.e.@xmath636 this gives @xmath630 , the discrete legendre transform of @xmath629 .",
    "if @xmath29 is @xmath637 , then this coincides with the classical notion of a discrete legendre transform .",
    "the discrete legendre transform has several relevant properties :    * the discrete legendre transform of @xmath630 is @xmath629 . * if we view the underlying topological spaces @xmath29 and @xmath167 as being identified by being the underlying space of dual cell complexes , then @xmath638 and @xmath639 , where the subscript denotes which affine structure is being used to define @xmath46 or @xmath229 .",
    "this hopefully makes it clear that the discrete legendre transform is a suitable replacement for the duality provided to us by the legendre transform of  2 .",
    "finally , it leads to what we may think of as an _ algebro - geometric syz procedure_. in analogy with the procedure suggested in  5 , we follow these steps :    1 .",
    "we begin with a toric degeneration of calabi - yau manifolds @xmath364 with an ample polarization .",
    "2 .   construct @xmath629 from this data , as explained above .",

    "4 .   try to construct a polarized degeneration of calabi - yau manifolds @xmath641 whose dual intersection complex is @xmath630 .",
    "the discrete legendre transform enables us to reproduce batyrev duality .",
    "returning to the construction of  4 and example [ toricdegenexample2 ] , choosing a strictly convex piecewise linear function on @xmath537 corresponding to a line bundle @xmath531 induces a polarization of @xmath541 .",
    "this then gives us a strictly convex multi - valued piecewise linear function @xmath642 on @xmath543 , hence a discrete legendre transform @xmath643 .",
    "in @xcite i showed that this is the dual intersection complex associated to some choice of subdivision @xmath644 of @xmath645 obtained by interchanging the roles of @xmath17 and @xmath235 in the construction of  4 .",
    "as an exercise , you can check the following for yourself .",
    "if we take @xmath299 , and in addition define @xmath646 to take the value @xmath81 on the primitive generator of each one - dimensional cone on @xmath279 , the normal fan to @xmath235 , then from  4 we obtain an affine structure with singularities on @xmath300 , and completely symetrically using @xmath647 we also obtain such a structure on @xmath648 .",
    "these manifolds come with polyhedral decomposition @xmath255 and @xmath579 consisting of all proper faces of @xmath17 and @xmath235 respectively .",
    "the anti - canonical polarizations on @xmath277 and @xmath246 induce multi - valued piecewise linear functions @xmath649 on @xmath29 and @xmath167 respectively .",
    "then show @xmath650 and @xmath651 are discrete legendre transforms of each other .",
    "thus batyrev ( and batyrev - borisov ) duality is a special case of this construction .",
    "the only step missing in this mirror symmetry algorithm is the last :    [ reconstruct2 ] given @xmath629 , is it possible to construct a polarized toric degeneration @xmath364 whose dual intersection complex is @xmath629 ?",
    "it is fairly obvious how to reconstruct the central fibre @xmath346 of a degeneration from the data @xmath630 , and we will see this explicitly in  8 .",
    "one could naively hope that this reducible variety has good deformation theory and it can be smoothed .",
    "however , in general its deformation theory is ill - behaved .",
    "as initially observed in the normal crossings case by kawamata and namikawa in @xcite , one needs to put some additional structure on @xmath346 before it has good deformation theory .",
    "this structure is a _ log structure _ , and introducing log structures allows us to study many aspects of mirror symmetry directly on the degenerate fibre itself .",
    "we shall do this in the next section , but first , let me address the question of how general this mirror symmetry construction might be :    if @xmath345 is a large complex structure limit degeneration , then @xmath33 is birationally equivalent to a toric degeneration @xmath652 .",
    "the condition of being a large complex structure limit , as defined by morrison in @xcite , is a stronger one than maximally unipotent .",
    "why should i imagine something like this to be true ?",
    "well , fantasizing freely , we would expect that after choosing a polarization and ricci - flat metric on fibres @xmath390 , we have a sequence @xmath653 converging to @xmath29 an affine manifold with singularities . now in general an affine manifold with singularities need not arise as the dual intersection complex of a toric degeneration , first of all because it need not have a toric polyhedral decomposition .",
    "for example , even in two dimensions there are orbifold singularities ( corresponding to singular elliptic fibres which are not semi - stable ) which do not arise in dual intersection complexes of toric degenerations , yet can occur as the base of a special lagrangian fibration on a k3 surface .",
    "however , the _ general _ base does arise as the dual intersection complex of a toric degeneration in the k3 case .",
    "the hope is that the condition of large complex structure limit forces the singularities of @xmath29 to be `` sufficiently general '' so that one can construct a nice toric polyhedral decomposition @xmath255 on @xmath29 , and from this construct a toric degeneration .",
    "presumably , this toric degeneration will be , if picked correctly , birational to the original one .",
    "this argument of course is rather hand - wavy , but i believe it provides some moral expectation that there might be a large class of degenerations for which our method applies .",
    "i note that one can prove the conjecture in the case of k3 surfaces .",
    "we now come to the technical heart of the program laid out in @xcite",
    ". some aspects of this program are quite technical , so the goal here is to explain the highlights of @xcite as simply possible .",
    "we first introduce the log structures of fontaine - illusie and kato ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    a log structure on a scheme ( or analytic space )",
    "@xmath5 is a ( unital ) homomorphism @xmath654 of sheaves of ( multiplicative and commutative ) monoids inducing an isomorphism @xmath655 .",
    "the triple @xmath656 is then called a _",
    "log space_. we often write the whole package as @xmath657 .",
    "a morphism of log spaces @xmath658 consists of a morphism @xmath659 of underlying spaces together with a homomorphism @xmath660 commuting with the structure homomorphisms : @xmath661    the key examples :    [ logexamples ] ( 1 ) let @xmath5 be a scheme and @xmath662 a closed subset of codimension one",

    "then the inclusion @xmath664 of the sheaf of regular functions with zeroes contained in @xmath360 is a log structure on @xmath5 .",

    "we call @xmath698 the _ ghost sheaf _ of the log structure .",
    "i like to view @xmath698 as specifying the combinatorial information associated to the log structure .",
    "for example , if @xmath657 is induced by the cartier divisor @xmath699 with @xmath5 normal , then the stalk @xmath700 at @xmath358 is the monoid of effective cartier divisors on a neighbourhood of @xmath482 supported on @xmath360 .",

    ", we see that given a toric degeneration @xmath364 the dual intersection complex _",
    "completely determines _ the ghost sheaf @xmath710 off of @xmath500 .",
    "we in fact take the view that anyway the log structure on @xmath500 is not particularly well - behaved , and we always ignore it on @xmath500 .",

    "there is an induced map @xmath714 , as @xmath715 because @xmath346 is cohen - macaulay .",
    "thus in what follows , if we have determined a log structure on @xmath712 , we just as well get a log structure on @xmath346 and will not concern ourselves with the behaviour of this log structure along @xmath500 .",
    "all this gives the necessary hint for working backwards , to go from @xmath543 to @xmath696 .",

    "the condition that @xmath255 is a toric polyhedral decomposition tells us that @xmath721 and @xmath722 are isomorphic toric varieties , and we can choose a torus equivariant isomorphism @xmath723 for each edge @xmath8 .",
    "if we choose these gluing maps to satisfy a certain compatibility condition on codimension two strata ( we leave it to the reader to write down this simple compatibility condition ) , then we can glue together the @xmath604 s to obtain , in general , an algebraic space we write as @xmath724 , where @xmath725 is the collection of gluing maps .",
    "( in @xcite , we describe the gluing data in a slightly different , but equivalent , way ) .",
    "we call @xmath726 _ closed gluing data_. this is how we construct a potential central fibre of a toric degeneration .",
    "now @xmath724 can not be a central fibre of a toric degeneration unless it carries a log structure of the correct sort .",
    "there are many reasons this may not happen .",
    "first , if @xmath726 is poorly chosen , there may be zero - dimensional strata of @xmath724 which do not have neighbourhoods locally tale isomorphic to the toric boundary of an affine toric variety ; this is a minimum prerequisite . as a result , we have to restrict attention to closed gluing data induced by what we call _ open gluing data_. explicitly , each maximal cell @xmath566 defines an affine toric variety @xmath727 given by the cone @xmath728 , assuming we view @xmath475 as a lattice polytope . let @xmath729 be the toric boundary .",
    "it turns out , as we show in @xcite , that a necessary condition for @xmath724 to be the central fibre of a toric degeneration is that it is obtained by dividing out @xmath730 by an tale equivalence relation .",
    "in other words , we are gluing together the @xmath731 s to obtain an algebraic space , and those tale equivalence relations which produce algebraic spaces of the form @xmath724 are easily determined .",
    "this is carried out in detail in @xcite ,  2 .",
    "the construction there appears technically difficult because of the necessity of dealing with algebraic spaces , but is basically straightforward .",
    "the basic point is that if @xmath732 are two maximal cells , with @xmath733 , then @xmath704 determines faces of the cones @xmath734 and @xmath735 , hence open subsets @xmath736 , with toric boundaries @xmath737 . now in general there is no _ natural _ isomorphism between @xmath738 and @xmath739 : this is a problem when @xmath740 , where @xmath276 is as usual the singular locus of @xmath29 .",
    "however , crucially @xmath741 and @xmath742 are naturally isomorphic , and we can choose compatible equivariant isomorphisms to obtain _ open gluing data_. choosing open gluing data allows us to define the tale equivalence relation : we are just gluing any two sets @xmath743 via the chosen isomorphism between @xmath741 and @xmath742 .",

    "the advantage of using open gluing data is that each @xmath731 for @xmath746 carries a log structure induced by the divisorial log structure @xmath729 .",
    "unfortunately , these log structures are not identified under the open gluing maps , precisely because of a lack of a natural isomorphism between the @xmath747 s cited above .",
    "however , the ghost sheaves of the log structures are isomorphic .",
    "so the ghost sheaves @xmath748 glue to give a ghost sheaf of monoids @xmath749 . summarizing what we have said so far : ( this is a combination of results of @xcite ,   2,4 )    given @xmath543 , if @xmath726 is closed gluing data , and @xmath750 is the central fibre of a toric degeneration @xmath364 with dual intersection complex @xmath543 , then @xmath726 is induced by open gluing data and @xmath751 .",
    "this is as far as we can get with the combinatorics .",
    "the next point is to attempt to construct @xmath752 .",
    "the idea is that @xmath752 is an extension of @xmath749 by @xmath753 , so we are looking for some subsheaf of the sheaf @xmath754 here the superscript @xmath755 denotes the grothendieck group of the monoid .",

    "of course , one also needs a map @xmath759 , and this complicates things a bit . to make a long story short",
    ", we can identify a subsheaf of extensions which yield genuine log structures .",
    "a section of this subsheaf determines a log structure on @xmath724 with the correct ghost sheaf .",
    "however , this is not precisely what we want .",
    "what we really want is a log structure on @xmath724 along with a log morphism @xmath760 which is log smooth .",
    "( we will address the question of the bad set @xmath761 shortly . )",
    "we call such a structure a",
    "_ log smooth structure _ on @xmath724 .",
    "it turns out these structures are given by certain sections of @xmath762 , where @xmath763 is the canonical section of @xmath749 whose germ at @xmath764 is @xmath81 for @xmath765 a generic point of an irreducible component of @xmath724 .",
    "so in fact , we can identify a subsheaf of @xmath766 , which we call @xmath767 , whose sections determine a log structure on @xmath724 _ and _ a log smooth morphism @xmath768 , i.e.  a log smooth structure .",
    "the technical heart of @xcite is an explicit calculation of the sheaf @xmath767 .",
    "this is carried out locally in @xcite , theorem 3.22 , where the sheaf is calculated on the ( tale ) open subsets @xmath731 of @xmath724 , and globally in @xcite , theorem 3.24 .",
    "i will not state the precise results , but go into detail in a special case , which illustrates the most important features of the theory .",
    "suppose @xmath724 is normal crossings , i.e.  every cell of @xmath255 is affine isomorphic to a standard simplex .",
    "then we have the local @xmath769 sheaf , @xmath770 this is a line bundle on @xmath771 .",
    "then one can show @xmath767 is the @xmath772-torsor associated to @xmath769 .",

    "a variety with normal crossings is _",
    "@xmath773-semistable _ if @xmath774 .",
    "thus we recover kawamata and namikawa s result @xcite showing that @xmath724 carries a normal crossings log structure over @xmath676 if and only if @xmath724 is @xmath773-semistable .",
    "this is because , of course , the @xmath772-torsor associated to @xmath769 has a section if and only if @xmath774 .",
    "now theorem 3.24 of @xcite tells us that in general @xmath767 is not a trivial @xmath772-torsor .",
    "the sheaf depends continuously on @xmath726 , but discretely on monodromy of the singularities of @xmath29 .",
    "let s explain the latter point explicitly if @xmath775 .",
    "the irreducible components of @xmath776 are in one - to - one correspondence with one - dimensional cells of @xmath255 .",
    "if @xmath777 is such an edge , suppose it contains one singularity of @xmath29 such that @xmath46 has monodromy @xmath778 in a suitable basis around a loop around the singularity .",
    "then @xmath769 restricted to the one - dimensional stratum @xmath779 of @xmath724 is @xmath780 .    to make this statement completely accurate",
    ", one needs to define @xmath7 so that it is independent of the choice of basis and loop . to do this , one chooses a loop which is counterclockwise with respect to the orientation determined by the chosen basis of @xmath781 , where @xmath782 is the base - point of the loop .",
    "if all the @xmath7 s appearing are positive , then for some choices of gluing data @xmath726 , we may hope to have a section @xmath371 of @xmath769 which vanishes only at a finite set of points @xmath500 .",
    "if @xmath500 does not contain a toric stratum ( i.e.  a triple point ) then we obtain a log structure on @xmath783 of the desired sort , hence a log structure on @xmath724 ( log smooth off of @xmath500 ) by push - forward .",
    "we then have    in the situation of this example , with @xmath775 and @xmath784 a section vanishing on a finite set @xmath500 not containing a triple point , there exists a smoothing @xmath364 of @xmath724 such that the singular locus of @xmath429 is @xmath785 , and the induced log morphism @xmath786 coincides with @xmath768 determined by @xmath371 .    the proof of this is a rather simple application of friedman s or kawamata and namikawa s results . to apply these results",
    ", however , we need to deal with the singular set @xmath500 .",

    "however , one would like a more explicit description of this moduli space in any event . in general",

    "we saw that the basic topology of mirror symmetry works only when the fibration is simple .",

    "let us just say here that if @xmath29 is simple in this new sense and @xmath800 was compactified in a sensible manner to a topological torus fibration @xmath190 , then @xmath33 would be simple in the sense of  1 , provided that @xmath801 . in higher dimensions , this new simplicity does not necessarily imply the old simplicity ; see the forthcoming ph.d .",

    "this arises in situations where orbifold singularities arise in @xmath176 ; as is well - known , such singularities can not be avoided in higher dimension .",

    "extraordinarily , the a priori very complicated moduli space of log calabi - yau spaces with a given dual intersection complex has a very simple description when @xmath29 is simple !",
    "one very difficult main result of @xcite , ( theorem 5.4 ) is    given @xmath543 positive and simple , the set of log calabi - yau spaces with dual intersection complex @xmath543 , modulo isomorphism preserving @xmath29 , is @xmath802 .",
    "an isomorphism is said to preserve @xmath29 if it induces the identity on the dual intersection complex .",
    "so the moduli space is an algebraic torus ( or a disjoint union of algebraic tori ) of dimension equal to @xmath803 .",
    "note that this is the expected dimension predicted by the syz conjecture .",
    "indeed , if a smoothing of @xmath804 exists and it was a topological compactification @xmath176 of @xmath805 , with a simple torus fibration @xmath190 extending @xmath307 , then @xmath806 , so by simplicity , @xmath807 .",
    "the discussion of  1 suggests that @xmath808 is @xmath809 of the smoothing , which is of course the dimension of the complex moduli space of the smoothing .",
    "this argument can be made rigorous by introducing _",

    "a _ log derivation _ on @xmath657 over @xmath811 with values in an @xmath812-module @xmath813 is a pair @xmath814 , where @xmath815 is an ordinary derivation of @xmath816 and @xmath817 is a homomorphism of abelian sheaves with @xmath818 ; these fulfill the following compatibility condition @xmath819 for all @xmath820 .",

    ", @xmath825 is locally free if @xmath826 is log smooth . as a result ,",
    "one can do deformation theory in the log category for log smooth morphisms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is one of the principal reasons for introducing log geometry into our picture .",
    "if @xmath768 is a log calabi - yau space , then the morphism is log smooth off of @xmath500 .",
    "define @xmath827 where @xmath828 is the inclusion .",
    "then one has    [ hodgedecomp ] suppose @xmath543 is positive and simple , and suppose we are given a log calabi - yau space @xmath768 which occurs as the central fibre of a toric degeneration @xmath798 whose general fibre @xmath390 is non - singular .",
    "then for @xmath829 and @xmath7 with @xmath830 , we have isomorphisms @xmath831 where @xmath832 and @xmath833 are the ordinary sheaves of holomorphic poly - vector fields and holomorphic differentials on a smooth fibre @xmath390 .    the proof of this result , along with a number of other results , appears in @xcite .",
    "the result holds for all @xmath834 when additional hypotheses are assumed , essentially saying the mirror to @xmath390 is non - singular .",

    "where the calabi - yaus arising are singular , one might speculate about the relationship between these groups , the actual hodge numbers and stringy hodge numbers .",
    "these issues are addressed in the forthcoming ph.d .",
    "thesis of helge ruddat .",
    "this section is purely philosophical . in most of our discussion in   7 and 8 , we focused on the dual intersection complex , and in particular , focused on the question of constructing a degeneration from its dual intersection complex . since our primary goal was to solve the reconstruction problem question [ reconstruct1 ] , and as the dual",
    "intersection complex is related to the complex structure ( theorem [ complextheorem ] ) it seems natural to focus on the dual intersection complex .",
    "we will see in the next section that this intuition may not always be correct .",
    "so far , the intersection complex only seemed to arise when talking about mirror symmetry .",
    "however , mirror symmetry instructs us to view both sides of the picture on the same footing .",
    "when we construct a degenerate calabi - yau space from a dual intersection complex , we say we are in the _ fan picture _ , while if we construct a degenerate calabi - yau space from an intersection complex , we say we are in the _ cone picture_.    more precisely , we have seen how given an integral affine manifold with singularities with toric polyhedral decomposition @xmath543 , then an additional choice of open gluing data @xmath726 specifies a space @xmath724 , along with a sheaf of monoids @xmath835 .",
    "some additional data may specify a log structure on @xmath724 with this ghost sheaf .",
    "the irreducible components of @xmath724 are defined using fans , given by the fan structure of @xmath255 at each vertex of @xmath255 .",
    "this is why we call this side the fan picture .    on the other hand ,",
    "given @xmath543 we can also construct a _ projective _ scheme @xmath836 given suitable gluing data @xmath837 .",
    "the irreducible components of this scheme are in one - to - one correspondence with the maximal cells of @xmath255 ; given such a maximal cell @xmath263 , viewing it as a lattice polytope in @xmath637 determines a projective toric variety , and @xmath838 is obtained by gluing together these projective toric varieties using the data @xmath837 .",
    "this is not quite the same data as occurred in the fan picture , because we also need to glue the line bundles , and this is additional data .",
    "the reason for calling this side the cone picture is that each irreducible component can be described as follows . given @xmath475 , let @xmath839",
    ". then the corresponding projective toric variety is @xmath840 $ ] , where @xmath841 $ ] is graded using the projection of @xmath842 onto @xmath77 .",
    "hence the irreducible components and strata arise from cones over elements of @xmath255 .",
    "we summarize the duality between the cone and fan pictures :    ( some restrictions may apply to gluing data on both sides in order for @xmath592 to yield the desired data . )    in particular , mirror symmetry interchanges discrete information about the log structure ( i.e.  @xmath835 ) and discrete information about the polarization ( i.e the class of the line bundle on each irreducible component ) .",
    "so far we have seen only the most elementary aspects of mirror symmetry emerge from this algebro - geometric version of syz , e.g. the interchange of hodge numbers .",
    "however , the real interest in this approach lies in hints that it will provide a natural explanation for rational curve counting in mirror symmetry .",
    "if we follow the philosophy of the previous section , we need to identify structures on affine manifolds with singularities which in one of the two pictures has to do with rational curves and in the other picture has to do with periods .",
    "i believe the correct structure to study is that of tropical curves on affine manifolds with singularities @xmath29 .",
    "see @xcite,@xcite for an introduction to tropical curves in @xmath637 . here",
    ", we can take @xmath29 to be tropical , rather than integral ; hence the name .",
    "let @xmath29 be a tropical affine manifold with singularities with discriminant locus @xmath235 .",
    "let @xmath58 be a weighted , connected finite graph , with its set of vertices and edges denoted by @xmath843}$ ] and @xmath844}$ ] respectively , with weight function @xmath845 } \\rightarrow{\\mathbb{n}}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ ] .",
    "a parametrized tropical curve in @xmath29 is a continuous map @xmath846 satisfying the following conditions :    1 .   for every edge @xmath847 , @xmath848 is an embedding , @xmath849 is dense in @xmath850 , and there is a section @xmath851 which is tangent to @xmath852 at every point of @xmath853 .",
    "we choose this section to be primitive , i.e.  not an integral multiple of another section of @xmath854 .",
    "2 .   for every vertex @xmath855}$ ] , let @xmath856}$ ] be the edges adjacent to @xmath265 .",
    "let @xmath857 be the section of @xmath858 promised by ( 1 ) , chosen to point away from @xmath265 .",
    "this defines germs @xmath859 .",
    "1 .   if @xmath860 , the following _ balancing condition _ holds in @xmath861 : @xmath862 2 .   if @xmath863 , then the following balancing condition is satisfied in @xmath864 : @xmath865 the latter group is interpreted as follows .",
    "let @xmath866 be a point near @xmath867 , and identify , via parallel transport along a path between @xmath867 and @xmath109 , the groups @xmath864 and @xmath868 with local monodromy invariant subgroups of @xmath869 and @xmath870 respectively .",
    "then @xmath871 is a subgroup of @xmath869 , and the intersection makes sense .",
    "it is independent of the choice of @xmath109 and path .",
    "so tropical curves behave away from the discriminant locus of @xmath29 much as the tropical curves of @xcite,@xcite do , but they may have legs terminating on the discriminant locus . as we are interested in the case that @xmath29 is compact , we do not want legs which go off to @xmath872 .",
    "i warn the reader , however , that this definition is provisional , and the behaviour in ( 2 ) ( b ) may not be exactly what we want .",
    "now let us connect this to the question of counting curves .",

    "let us assume that @xmath876 is a non - singular curve for @xmath493 . in the logarithmic context",

    "this theory should generalize the theories developed by li and ruan @xcite and jun li @xcite .",
    "i will say little about this here , as this rapidly gets quite technical .",
    "there is work in progress of siebert on this subject .",
    "this point of view has already been used in @xcite for counting curves in toric varieties , so some more hints of this approach can be found there .",
    "instead , i wish to sketch how such a diagram yields a tropical curve .    to do so , consider a situation where @xmath826 is normal crossings , and the induced map @xmath881 has no infinitesimal log automorphisms over @xmath676 .",
    "( this is the log equivalent of the notion of stable map ) .",
    "let @xmath543 be the dual intersection complex of the log calabi - yau space @xmath696 .",

    "this may be surprising given that all of our discussions involving the strategy of building log calabi - yau spaces was done on the fan side .",
    "however , if we take the mirror philosophy seriously , and we want to see tropical curves appear in a description of a smoothing , we need to work on the cone side .",
