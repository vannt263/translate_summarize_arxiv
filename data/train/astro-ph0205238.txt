    "therefore , ( 2 + 2 ) models are also strongly disfavored by standard bbn .",
    "the possibility that a four neutrino mass scheme could be arranged in such a way as to evade sterile - thermalization constraints were considered by bell , foot & volkas  @xcite and shi , fuller & abazajian  @xcite .",

    "the sign of resonantly generated electron neutrino / antineutrino asymmetry can be chaotic  @xcite , or at least not well determined  @xcite , having an significant chance ( 50% if chaotically random ) of being negative and actually _ increasing _ @xmath19 by altering beta - equilibrium in the opposite direction .",
    "if the sign of the asymmetry _ is _ randomly chaotic , then causally disconnected regions will have different sign asymmetries , which leads to an enhancement of the transformation of active neutrinos into sterile neutrinos at the boundaries of regions of different sign  @xcite and potentially placing more stringent constraints on four neutrino mass schemes  @xcite .",
    "there is considerable evidence now that the solar solution lies in the lma region of parameter space  @xcite .",
