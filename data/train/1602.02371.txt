    "_ dehn surgery _ can be regarded as an operation to make a ` new ' 3-manifold from a given one .",
    "of course the trivial dehn surgery leaves the manifold unchanged , but ` most ' non - trivial ones would change the topological type .",
    "in fact , gordon and luecke showed as the famous result in @xcite that any non - trivial dehn surgery on a non - trivial knot in the 3-sphere @xmath6 never yields @xmath6 .",
    "as a natural generalization , the following conjecture was raised .    * cosmetic surgery conjecture * ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 1.81(a ) ) ) : two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic .",
    "here we say that two slopes are _ equivalent _ if there exists a homeomorphism of the exterior of a knot @xmath7 taking one slope to the other , and two surgeries on @xmath7 along slopes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are _ purely cosmetic _ if there exists an orientation preserving homeomorphism between the pair of the surgered manifolds .",
    "the cosmetic surgery conjecture for `` chirally cosmetic '' case is not true : there exist counter - examples given by mathieu @xcite .",

    ", we consider cosmetic surgeries on a well - known class of knots in @xmath6 , the _ two - bridge knots_. first , by using known results , we have the following in section [ 2-bridge ] .    [ atmost9 ] all the two - bridge knots of at most @xmath13 crossings other than @xmath0 $ ] admit no purely cosmetic surgery pairs .    here",
    "the knot @xmath3 in the rolfsen s knot table is the two - bridge knot of the schubert form @xmath14 and the conway form @xmath15 $ ] .    in view of this , let us focus on the knot @xmath3 .",
    "previously , for the same reason , the first author considered this knot in @xcite , and it was shown that some pairs of surgeries give distinct manifolds .    in this paper , for a family of knots including the knot @xmath3 , we have the following .    [ mainthm ]",
    "let @xmath16 be a two - bridge knot of the conway form @xmath1 $ ] with @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath16 admits no cosmetic surgery pairs yielding homology 3-spheres , i.e. , any @xmath17- and @xmath18-surgeries on @xmath16 are not purely cosmetic for @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "all the homology 3-spheres obtained by dehn surgeries on @xmath16 are mutually distinct .",

    "our advantage in this paper is to use the @xmath5 version of the casson invariant .",
    "very roughly speaking , for a closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath21 , the @xmath5 casson invariant @xmath22 is defined by counting the ( signed ) equivalence classes of representations of the fundamental group @xmath23 in @xmath5 . based on the method to enumerate the boundary slopes for two - bridge knots developed in @xcite , we give calculations of the @xmath5 casson invariant for the knots @xmath16 s .",
    "the calculations will be given in section [ calculation ] . before that the formulae and the method used in the calculations will be explained in section [ sl(2,c)casson ] .",
    "practically our method can be applied further .",
    "however it seems not enough to prove that all the @xmath16 s have no purely cosmetic surgery pairs .",
    "here we recall basic definitions and terminology about dehn surgery .    a _ dehn surgery _",
    "is the following operation for a given knot @xmath7 ( i.e. , an embedded circle ) in a 3-manifold @xmath24 .",
    "take the exterior @xmath25 of @xmath7 ( i.e. , the complement of an open tubular neighborhood of @xmath7 in @xmath24 ) , and then , glue a solid torus to @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the slope ( i.e. , an isotopy class of a non - trivial unoriented simple loop ) on the peripheral torus of @xmath7 in @xmath24 which is represented by the curve identified with the meridian of the attached solid torus via the surgery .",
    "then , by @xmath27 , we denote the manifold which is obtained by the dehn surgery on @xmath7 , and call it the 3-manifold obtained by dehn surgery on @xmath7 along @xmath26 . in particular , the dehn surgery on @xmath7 along the meridional slope is called the _",
    "trivial _ dehn surgery .    when @xmath7 is a knot in @xmath6 , by using the standard meridian - longitude system , slopes on the peripheral torus are parametrized by rational numbers with @xmath28 .",
    "thus , when a slope @xmath26 corresponds to a rational number @xmath29 , we call dehn surgery along @xmath26 _ @xmath29-surgery _ , and use @xmath30 in stead of @xmath27 .",
    "for two - bridge knots , we use standard definitions based on @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .    to show proposition [ atmost9 ] , we use the following two known results .",
    "one ingredient is the casson invariant of 3-manifolds introduced by casson . by using the casson invariant ,",

    "the other one is the following excellent result recently obtained by ni and wu in @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is a non - trivial knot in @xmath6 and @xmath35 are two distinct slopes such that the surgered manifolds @xmath36 are orientation - preservingly homeomorphic .",
