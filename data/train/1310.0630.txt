    "spontaneous localization ( sl ) is an alternative to standard quantum theory motivated by the measurement problem @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in sl",
    "the quantum state has the status of a real physical object .",
    "the state evolves according to a stochastic generalization of the schrdinger equation and behaves in such a way that certain macro superposition states are unstable .",
    "the theory itself determines precisely which types of state are unstable and remarkably gives a universal account of phenomena which so far agrees with our experience ranging from the behaviour of quantum particles to the classical macroscopic world .",
    "spontaneous localization is particularly interesting because it makes several predictions which are in conflict with standard quantum theory .",
    "this means that there is the possibility to experimentally test it .",
    "for example , sl predicts the collapse of a superposition of quasi - localized wave packets for a particle ( or composite object ) of sufficiently large mass . the way to observe this process would be to look for a characteristic loss of interference when the packets are brought together .",
    "these kinds of experiments are being developed as part of a general program to observe quantum interference for objects of increasing mass .",
    "one promising experiment involves diffraction of a beam of au clusters by a laser grating @xcite ; another involves attempting to put a small mechanical device in a superposition of different position states @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this article we focus on the continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model @xcite and examine a selection of experimental scenarios in the limit is which the localization length scale is large compared to other length scales ( such as the spatial extent of the wave function ) .",
    "the reason for taking this limit is primarily to make calculations easier to perform .",
    "this enables us to obtain precise results within the regime of validity .",
    "however , we note that at present there is no upper bound on the csl length scale imposed by experimental results @xcite .",
    "our considerations might therefore be seen a way to further constrain the parameter space of the csl model .    in the csl model",
    "the state process is expressed as a stochastic differential equation for the state vector ( see sec .  [ s1 ] ) .",
    "stochastic changes in the state are governed by a classical noise process and for a given realization of this noise process the state vector follows a unique trajectory .",
    "however , it is convenient to consider a statistical ensemble of systems describing the result of running the same experiment with the same initial conditions many times .",
    "the dynamics then turn an initial pure state into a mixture of states , each resulting from a different realized noise .",
    "the appropriate way to describe this is in terms of a density operator @xmath0 , \\label{dop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes classical expectation over states .",
    "the density matrix can be written in terms of a density matrix propagator which for a single particle system is expressed in coordinate space as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the advantage of working with the density matrix propagator is that we can separate out the dependence on the initial condition .",
    "there are well established methods to determine the density matrix propagator , see e.g.  @xcite . here",
    "we will demonstrate that in the case where the system is more localized than the csl length scale , the csl master equation can be reduced to a form where the propagator is a gaussian function .",
    "this implies that for situations in which the initial wavefunction is of gaussian form ( or a superposition of gaussians ) , the final density matrix state can be straightforwardly determined by performing gaussian integrals over the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    after an introduction to the csl model in sec .",
    "[ s1 ] we apply the density matrix propagator technique to the two - slit experiment in sec .  [ stwoslit ] .",
    "we consider an initial wavefunction composed of two separated gaussian peaks corresponding to the particle passing through each of the two slits .",
    "we then allow the wave packets to spread and overlap and determine the probability distribution for the location of the particle .",
    "we find that the expected interference pattern degrades as a result of csl as either the mass of the particle increases , the slit width increases , or the separation between slits increases .",
    "we highlight the result that a cubic improvement on the degradation effect can be made by increasing the slit separation provided it is less than the csl length scale .",
    "the same techniques also allow us to consider interactions with more complicated potentials by treating the potential perturbatively .",
    "we demonstrate this in detail in sec .",
    "[ sscat ] where we consider a particle undergoing csl dynamics as it is scattered from a small potential barrier .",
    "we calculate the effect of the potential up to second order .",
    "this turns out to be the lowest order necessary in order to see reflection from the barrier .",
    "reflection from a barrier whose height is small compared to the energy of the incoming particle is a quantum mechanical effect which we might expect to be diminished by csl .",
    "however , we find that there is no appreciable reduction in the probability for reflection when compared to a standard quantum calculation .",
    "the significant difference is that the wave packet undergoes a characteristic spreading in momentum space .",
    "this is expected to be small given standard estimates for the csl parameters and the scattering does nothing to enhance the order of magnitude of the momentum diffusion over that which would occur for a free packet without the potential .    in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we apply the density matrix propagator technique to a situation involving @xmath7 particles . in csl",
    "the localization mechanism acts on the total particle number density state rather than on each particle individually .",
    "thus implies that for a system of 2 non - interacting particles , the localization mechanism will lead to correlations in the diffusion undergone by each particle separately . in order to demonstrate this we present the @xmath7-particle propagator and",
    "solve for a situation in which the initial wavefunctions of the particles perfectly overlap .",
    "we find that the final distribution of particle locations shows that the particles are more likely to be found closer together than would be expected if the particles behaved independently .",
    "we examine the possibility of this being used as an new experimental test of csl and consider the expected scales of magnitude required to see the effect .",
    "we end with some discussion and summary in sec .",
    "[ sdisc ] .",
    "here we present the csl model in terms of a diffusion process for the quantum state and show how it can be represented in terms of a deterministic master equation for the stochastically averaged density matrix ( [ dop ] ) .",

    "we will write down the master equation for the case of a one particle excitation and present the density matrix propagator . later in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we will do the same for a two identical particle state . for simplicity we work in 1 dimension .",

    "the first two ways offer the greatest improvement since they each have a cubic effect .",
    "the other way to eliminate interference effects is to make @xmath42 larger .",

    "the final example was to consider the csl evolution of 2 non - interacting particles . to give a concrete example we chose the 2 particles to be initially located in the same trap with the same initial wave function .",
    "once the trap is switched off the 2 particles evolve freely .",
    "however , their behaviour is coupled by the csl dynamics and this has the effect of making it more likely that the particles will be subsequently measured closer together than would be expected if the particles dispersed independently .",
    "we quantified this in the form of a joint probability distribution for the positions of the two particles .",
    "in general we have demonstrated the use of the density matrix propagator as a powerful tool for solving the csl model .",
    "the results derived are , in principle , experimentally observable and offer tests of csl against standard quantum theory .",
