    "manipulating spins in quantum dots in order to achieve new ways of processing information has been a subject of intense research in the last decade .",
    "@xcite one of the basic building blocks for quantum computing is a double quantum dot ( dqd),@xcite where the concepts of entanglement and phase accumulation may be effectively modelled and studied .",
    "@xcite it turns out that the key problem , which hampers the progress in implementing the quantum information storage and processing is the impossibility of perfect isolation of a complex quantum system from the environment , which results in the loss of quantum coherence.@xcite the phase coherence of tunnel transport through a quantum dot can be effectively controlled in an aharonov - bohm geometry @xcite and/or in the kondo regime.@xcite to understand the generic features of the decoherence phenomenon , various model situations are considered , where dephasing and relaxation processes are controlled by specific mechanisms of interaction with the external environment . among these processes",
    "the interaction with a phonon bath @xcite and an electron liquid @xcite should be regarded as typical examples .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a specific mechanism of decoherence and dephasing , which stems from the violation of _ dynamical symmetry _ in a dqd .",
    "this dynamical symmetry is an intrinsic property of any quantum dot with even occupation , where the low - energy spectrum of spin excitations is formed by singlet ( s ) and triplet ( t ) states .",
    "@xcite since the interaction with a reservoir ( electrons in metallic leads ) violates the spin conservation law , s / t transitions accompany the cotunneling through dqd and thus contribute to the tunneling transparency and , in particular , to the kondo - type zero - bias anomaly in tunnel conductance .",
    "the physical system in which we will study decoherence and dephasing effects is a dqd occupied by two electrons in a t - shape geometry ( tdqd ) , where only one of its two wells is in tunnel contact with the leads ( see fig . [ f.00 ] ) .",
    "as it is established , @xcite the electron states in this kind of quantum dot may be tuned in such a way that the low - energy spectrum consists of two singlets and one triplet .",
    "the symmetry of the pertinent quantum states is described by a non - compact group , that is , @xmath1 .",
    "decoherence and dephasing will be studied through the application of a time - dependent gate voltage to the side dot in a tdqd , and its influence on the resonance kondo tunneling .",
    "usually , decoherence in kondo tunneling arises due to non - equilibrium spin flip processes induced by an external time - dependent potential .",
    "@xcite here we propose an alternative mechanism , which involves processes with charge transfer between the two wells of the tdqd . as a result",
    ", the singlet excitons @xmath2 are involved in dephasing and decoherence processes .",
    "it will be shown that these processes arise due to dynamical gauge fluctuations , which accompany singlet - triplet transitions within various multiplets of the @xmath1 group .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : the underlying time - dependent hamiltonian is introduced in section ii , first as a generalized anderson impurity model , and then in terms of hubbard operators .",
    "section iii is devoted to the derivation of an effective spin hamiltonian ( following an appropriate schrieffer - wolff transformation ) and presentation of _ time dependent _ scaling equations for the relevant exchange constants .",
    "fluctuation corrections to the scaling equations are thoroughly discussed in section iv .",
    "this section is the central one , as it exposes the physical origin of dephasing , decoherence and relaxation in the present model system .",
    "since it might appear too technical , it is following by concluding remarks in section v , where the main results are explained verbally .",
    "related mathematical topics such as necessary ingredients of group theory , manipulations of vertex corrections and some aspects of analytical continuation as used in the calculations are explained in the following three appendices .",
    "we consider an asymmetric dqd studied in ref .",
    ", where only the left dot is coupled to the leads ( fig .",
    "[ f.00 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the capacitive energies in the left and right dots are different , @xmath3 so that the coulomb blockade completely suppresses doubly occupied states in the right dot .",
    "the gate voltages @xmath4 are applied separately to the left and right dots .",
    "the new ingredient here is the introduction of a small `` trembling '' ( time dependent ) component in the gate voltage of the right dot , so that @xmath5    let us first recall the spectrum of the tdqd in the absence of the time dependent component .",
    "the constant parts of the gate voltages are included in the energy levels of the double dot , @xmath6 .",
    "these voltages are tuned in such a way that @xmath7 hereafter , the fermi energy in the leads is chosen as the zero energy level . as excited states of the tdqd with two electrons in the right dot are excluded from the low - energy part of the spectrum ,",
    "the low energy levels of the tdqd are @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the potential which acts between the dots , see fig.1 .",
    "the notations @xmath10 respectively refer to triplet , singlet and exciton states of the tdqd . in the exciton state ,",
    "the two electrons reside on the left dot .",
    "the above results are obtained in first order of the small parameter @xmath11 .",
    "anticipating further analysis , we include in the low energy spectrum the level shifts @xmath12 which result from renormalization of the dot levels due to the tunnel contact with the leads ( the so called `` haldane renormalization '' @xcite , see below ) .",
    "it was shown in ref . that @xmath13 , so that the singlet and triplet levels may cross due to this renormalization .",
    "such level crossing occurs provided the charge transfer exciton energy @xmath14 is not very high . here",
    "we study just this regime , so that taking into account the above level renormalization , the ground state of the tdqd in a contact with the leads is a triplet state @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ f.00 ] , right panel ) .    having in mind the above energy level scheme ( [ dotnot ] ) for the tdqd with _",
    "constant _ gate voltages @xmath16 , we now consider the influence of the trembling potential @xmath0 on the dot spectrum . as usual , one should discriminate between slow and fast components of a temporal perturbation and treat the former processes in an adiabatic approximation . in order to separate adiabatic and non - adiabatic parts of the trembling potential",
    "it is useful to introduce the spectral density @xmath17 of the trembling potential @xmath18 : @xmath19 in the present study we are mainly interested in the nearly adiabatic regime , where the spectral density is concentrated in the frequency interval @xmath20 with @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the contribution of the trembling potential may be treated by means of time - dependent scaling approach , while non - adiabatic corrections should be considered perturbatively .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ f.00 ] has the following form : @xmath22 here the first term is the band hamiltonian , which describes electrons in the leads [ source ( @xmath23 ) and drain ( @xmath24 ) , respectively ] , @xmath25 @xmath26 are the wave vector and spin projection , respectively .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian involves only electrons in the left dot .",
    "@xmath27 where the operators @xmath28 correspond to electrons in the tdqd . in the tunneling part [ htun ] we have already excluded one of the two channels from the tunneling hamiltonian by introducing even and odd combinations of electron wave function in two leads",
    ". then , only the even standing wave @xmath29 enters @xmath30 ( we consider a completely symmetric device with lead - dot tunneling constants @xmath31 ) .",
    "it is useful at this point to carry out some manipulations which will turn the discussion more transparent . in the first step ,",
    "a canonical transformation is performed , @xcite which eliminates the trembling potential from the diagonal part of the dot hamiltonian @xmath32 with @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the density operator for the electrons in the left @xmath37 and right ( @xmath38 ) dot .",

    "[ tremb ] : @xmath43 then , expanding the exponent in terms of the weak trembling potential , we come to the expression , @xmath44    in the next step , it proves to be more convenient to work in a representation @xmath45 , which diagonalizes the dot hamiltonian , i.e. to rewrite it in terms of hubbard operators @xmath46 .",
    "after the standard diagonalization procedure for the _ time independent _ part of the hamiltonian we have @xcite @xmath47 recall again that @xmath48 stand for triplet , singlet and charge transfer exciton states of tdqd , respectively while @xmath49 are the spin projections of the triplet state .",
    "the diagonal hubbard operators are constrained by the condition @xmath50    in terms of hubbard operators the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ htun ] ) acquires the form @xmath51 here the index @xmath52 stands for the electron in the right well with spin projection @xmath53 , which remains in the tdqd , when the electron @xmath54 escapes from the left well to the lead . as was mentioned above , the lead state @xmath55 means the even combination of lead electrons with the wave vector @xmath56 .",
    "all tunneling transitions are described by the same constant @xmath57 .",
    "next , the haldane - anderson scaling approach @xcite should be applied to @xmath67 in order to rescale the energies in the tdqd . here",
    "@xmath68 ( [ 1.2 ] ) contains the time - dependent component . unlike the static case considered in ref .",
    ", we deal here with a tdqd whose hamiltonian is non - diagonal in @xmath69 , such that the off - diagonal elements are time - dependent .",
    "however , for the slow trembling potential with characteristic frequencies @xmath70 , one may treat this time - dependent term _ adiabatically _ at least in zero - order approximation .",
    "this means that before turning to the haldane rg procedure , one has to get rid of the non - diagonal @xmath71 mixing terms with the help of a second time - dependent canonical transformation .",
    "this transformation is given by the matrix @xmath72 , which is found from the condition @xcite @xmath73=i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t}.\\ ] ] within the adiabatic approximation , one may carry out this diagonalization procedure at each moment @xmath74 neglecting any retardation and omitting the term in the r.h.s . of this equation .",
    "then the matrix @xmath75 is given by @xmath76    at this stage , we apply the `` adiabatic '' haldane rg procedure , i.e. calculate the scaling trajectories of the energy states , which evolve with the reduction of the energy scale in the metallic reservoir from the initial value @xmath77 to the actual value @xmath78 . since the transformations ( [ 1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.11 ] ) do not involve the triplet state , the scaling trajectory @xmath79 as a function of scaling variable @xmath80 is the same as in our previous calculations .",
    "@xcite as a result , the triplet state includes only the time - independent haldane shift , whereas the two singlet states acquire time dependence , @xmath81 here @xmath82 is an additional time - dependent adiabatic part within the haldane renormalization scheme .",
    "thus , the term @xmath83 in the dot hamiltonian ( [ 1.2 ] ) is given by eq .",

    "we see that the trembling potential involves a contribution of the excited singlet in the tunneling hamiltonian , and the latter introduces fluctuations in tunneling through the ground state singlet .",
    "the spin @xmath92 states are not involved in these trembling processes .",
    "however , eventually we expect that the triplet is subject to dephasing via the operators @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see equation [ sw2 ] below ) due to dynamical @xmath1 symmetry of the tdqd ( see appendix a )",
