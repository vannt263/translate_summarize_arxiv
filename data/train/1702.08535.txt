    "hot , luminous stars undergo mass loss through a steady outflow of supersonic material from the stellar surface . these radiatively driven _ stellar winds _ are best characterized through modeling uv resonance lines , which are sensitive to wind properties .",
    "recent spectropolarimetric measurements have revealed approximately 10% of massive stars host strong , stable , nearly dipolar magnetic fields with surface field strength of approximately 1 kg or more ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field channels the flow of the stellar wind along its field lines , confining the wind within closed loops and reducing the overall mass loss ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adm_owocki ] ) .",
    "this results in a _ dynamic _ and _ structurally complex _",
    "so - called magnetosphere ( @xcite ) with observational diagnostics in the optical , uv , and x - ray regimes ( @xcite , david - uraz et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "[ fig : pcyg_real ] shows hst uv spectra of ngc 1624 - 2 , the most magnetic o star observed to date , compared with hd 93146 and hd 36861 ( non - magnetic o stars of similar spectral type ) . in stark contrast to the strong line saturation observed in non - magnetic o stars , ngc 1624 - 2 and other magnetic o - type stars such as hd 57628 , hd 191612 , cpd -28 2561 , show _ atypically unsaturated _ p - cygni profiles in the civ resonant doublet , as well as a distinct dependence on rotational phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the development of specialized analytical tools is necessary to interpret these profiles and derive the associated wind properties .     and reaching a maximum radius @xmath0 at the magnetic equator .",
    "magnetically - confined wind material from both stellar hemispheres flows up from the stellar surface ( black arrows ) , and shocks at the magnetic equator .",
    "the shock front retreats to shock radius @xmath1 , cooling the hot gas through the release of x - rays .",
    "the cooled post - shock material then flows back along the field lines toward the stellar surface ( blue arrows ) .",
    "reproduced from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* owocki et al . ( 2016 ) ) . ]",
    "in general , the dipolar axis of magnetic ob stars is not aligned with the rotational axis .",
    "therefore , the resulting magnetospheres produce rotationally modulated variability in wind - sensitive uv line profiles and significantly reduced mass - loss rates ( @xcite ) .",
    "p - cygni line profiles can provide a powerful tool to probe the structure of these magnetospheres .",
    "a detailed investigation of the density and velocity structure of magnetically channeled winds has been carried out using magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "although this work has provided unprecedented insight , these simulations remain computationally cumbersome and expensive .",
    "the recently published analytic dynamical magnetosphere ( adm ) model ( @xcite ) provides a simplified parametric prescription corresponding to a time - averaged picture of the normally complex magnetospheric structure previously derived through full mhd simulations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adm_owocki ] , outflowing material leaves the stellar surface and is channeled along the field lines . at the magnetic equator ,",
    "the outflowing material ( `` upflow '' ) from each hemisphere collides , producing a shock .",
    "cooling is achieved through x - ray production , allowing the wind material to flow back toward the stellar surface ( `` downflow '' ) .",
    "this model shows remarkable agreement with h@xmath2 and x - ray observations .",
    "however , as yet the adm model has not been used to explain uv line variability , particularly with respect to the observed unsaturated absorption troughs of civ lines .",
    "this provides the unique opportunity to conduct a thorough parameter study capable of accurately reproducing observed trends without the usual computational complexities associated with multi - dimensional mhd modeling .",
    "we examine the effect of non - radial , magnetically channeled wind outflows on uv line formation through the development of synthetic uv wind - line profiles which implement the adm formalism developed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* owocki et al . ( 2016 ) ) .",
    "we solve the equation of radiative transfer using a sobolev exact integration ( sei ) method ( both in the optically thin and optically thick approximations , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* owocki & rybicki ( 1985 ) ) ) to produce synthetic p - cygni profiles for comparison with observational data . for simplicity",
    ", these preliminary models only implement the wind upflow component .",
    "we also limit these initial investigations to the magnetic `` pole - on '' and `` equator - on '' viewing angles .",
    "initial results ( see fig . [",
    "fig : c_models ] ) show that significant desaturation of the uv wind - line absorption troughs , both in the magnetic `` pole - on '' and `` equator - on '' views , occurs naturally from the addition of a dipolar magnetic field at the stellar surface .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier studies , which used mhd simulations to synthesize uv line profiles ( @xcite ) as well as observational data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pcyg_real ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the desaturation is a direct result of the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , comparison with observational data also reveals a failure to reproduce the exact phase dependence of the lines , indicating the need for further investigation and additional modeling .    in comparison to other computationally expensive mhd modeling techniques",
    ", the adm formalism allows us to provide meaningful results that can be applied across a broader spectrum of magnetic massive stars .",
    "future models will include both the wind upflow and downflow regions , as well as the addition of a `` shock retreat '' boundary to account for x - ray production in the wind .",
    "further consideration of the effects of an approximated source function ( as opposed to one that is solved self - consistently ) also need to be explored .",
    "the detection and characterization of magnetic fields in massive stars currently relies heavily on spectropolarimetry , a powerful but expensive technique .",
    "given these limitations , the future of the field of massive star magnetism might rely on indirect detection methods .",
    "therefore , the development of robust uv diagnostics will be a critical step forward in understanding the circumstellar environment of massive stars , as well as the possible presence of an underlying field ."
