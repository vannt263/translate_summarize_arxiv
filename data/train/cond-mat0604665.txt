    "the dressing of the charge carriers in high - t@xmath0 superconductors ( htscs ) is still one of the most exciting topics in solid state physics .",
    "the htscs are a paradigm for the transition of a correlated system from an insulating to a metallic state .",
    "the dressing of the charge carriers in htscs is likely caused by the same interaction that gives rise to the superconductivity , hence the understanding of the quasiparticle self - energy may help to understand the origin of the mechanism of high - t@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the dressing can be studied by various experimental methods but angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy is the only method which gives a quantitative information on the momentum dependence of those renormalization effects . in htscs",
    "there are two important regions on the fermi surface : the nodal region , where the diagonal of the brillouin zone cuts the fermi surface and where the @xmath3wave superconducting order parameter changes sign .",
    "this region mostly contributes to the transport properties , particularly in the underdoped region , where a pseudogap opens up , squeezing the fermi surface to a region near the nodes .",
    "the other ( antinodal ) region is one where the edge of the brillouin zone cuts the fermi surface . in this region",
    ", the order parameter in hole doped superconductors has its maximum .",
    "this region is therefore mostly relevant for the studies of the superconducting properties .",
    "there are numerous arpes studies on the renormalization effects near the nodal point,@xcite but only a few studies are concentrated at the antinodal point @xcite .    in the bilayer systems",
    "the study of the antinodal point is complicated by the bilayer splitting , which could not be resolved for 15 years . on the other hand , only in the bilayer system of the bi - htsc family the entire superconducting region from underdoped ( ud ) via optimally doped ( op ) to overdoped ( od ) can be studied . in the superconducting state",
    "a well pronounced peak - dip - hump structure has been detected @xcite .",
    "this structure was originally explained @xcite solely in terms of a coupling to a bosonic mode , similar to the mcmillan - rowell explanation of the tunnelling spectra in conventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "later on , it was established that this peak - dip - hump structure is partially caused by the bilayer splitting @xcite . by varying the photon energy h@xmath4 in the arpes experiments , and exploiting the different energy dependence of the matrix elements for the excitations from the bonding and the antibonding bands , it became possible to separate the two bands @xcite and to extract the full energy- and momentum - dependent spectral weight separately in each of the bands .",
    "this procedure allowed the authors of refs .   to find the intrinsic peak - dip - hump structure , and to demonstrate that the strength of this intrinsic effect is doping - dependent , and decreases in going from ud to od materials .",
    "an important characteristic of the interaction between fermionic and bosonic excitations is the energy - dependent , dimensionless coupling @xmath5 . in theories where the fermionic self - energy depends on energy , @xmath6 , much stronger than on the momentum @xmath7",
    ", this dimensionless coupling is related to the self - energy via @xmath8 .",
    "it is also relevant whether the measurements are performed in the normal or in the superconducting state .",
    "we will label the corresponding couplings as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "if the normal state is a fermi liquid , @xmath11 is finite , and is often called a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "it determines the mass renormalization of the fermionic quasiparticles via @xmath12 .",
    "the coupling constant can , in principle , be extracted from arpes measurements of the quasiparticle dispersion in the normal state at the lowest energies , however this procedure requires one to know both @xmath13 and the _ bare _ mass , @xmath14 . in previous analysis  @xcite , the mass , @xmath14 , was extracted from a tight - binding model with parameters derived from a fit of the fermi surface and from the quasiparticle dispersion measured along the nodal direction  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data in the antinodal region yielded @xmath15 both in ud and od materials .",
    "this result should be contrasted with values  @xcite of @xmath16 at the nodal point .",
    "it is consistent with expectations as for non rotationally - invariant systems the coupling @xmath17 depends on the position on the fermi surface .    in the superconducting state ,",
    "the measured quasiparticle energy in the antinodal region is bounded by the superconducting gap , @xmath18 , and it becomes an issue at which energy one extracts the coupling @xmath10 from the data . in previous analysis , the coupling was extracted from the self - energy measured at @xmath19 .",
    "this coupling @xmath20 turns out to be larger than @xmath21 , and it also rapidly increases from od to ud samples ( @xmath22 for dopant concentration @xmath23 ) .    in this communication",
    "we extend our previous analysis of the antinodal self - energy in the superconducting state  @xcite and show how one can extract the coupling at zero frequency @xmath24 from the arpes data .",
    "we find that @xmath25 is smaller than @xmath20 and within a certain model is also smaller than the normal state coupling @xmath21 , in agreement with earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "we show that the large value of @xmath20 and its strong doping dependence are at least partially due to the fact that the fermionic self - energy in a superconductor actually diverges at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the energy of the bosonic mode .",
    "if the bosonic mode is the spin resonance peak , its energy decreases with decreasing doping . then @xmath28 and @xmath29 come closer to each other in the ud regime , and @xmath20 strongly increases .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis in ref .  .",
    "our present analysis is based on the measurements of the quasiparticle spectral function in the antinodal region of the high - t@xmath0 superconductor ( bi , pb)@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath30 ( bipb2212 ) in the superconducting state .",
    "we go beyond a previous arpes study which has analyzed the energy dependence of the spectral weight just at the @xmath31 point @xcite , and study the whole antinodal region .",
    "we interpret our results in the superconducting state in terms of model self - energy function which is composed of two terms .",
    "the first and dominant term is due to a strong coupling of the charge carriers to a single bosonic mode .",
    "the second term describes a band renormalization at higher energies and is assumed to have a fermi - liquid form .",
    "we extract both couplings from the fits to the data .",
    "we used two models for electron - boson coupling .",
    "the first model is a one - mode model for an interaction with an einstein boson , which is assumed to be independent on fermions .",
    "second is a collective mode model , in which the bosonic spectrum in the normal state is rather flat and incoherent , but splits into a mode and into gapped continuum in the superconducting state due to the feedback effect from the pairing .",
    "this second model is appropriate if the boson is a spin collective mode of fermions .",
    "we obtain a rather good agreement between the parameters derived from the analysis of the experimental data using the model self - energy function and the calculated values using the collective mode model .",
    "this yields a strong indication that the dominant part of the renormalization of the fermionic dispersion is due to a coupling of collective spin excitations .",

    "we start with an assumption that the fermi energy @xmath32 is much larger than the mode energy @xmath27 .",
    "the validity of this assumption for very underdoped cuprates has been questioned recently @xcite because there the bandwidth is strongly reduced due to correlation effects associated with mott physics . here",

    "thus the agreement of the relative and absolute experimental values of the coupling constants with those derived from the collective mode model is a strong indication that the dressing of the charge carriers in the ( @xmath196,0 ) region ( i.e. the region were the superconducting order parameter has its maximum ) is predominantly determined by a coupling to spin excitations , in particular to the magnetic resonance mode .",

    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is used to study the spectral function of the optimally doped high - t@xmath0 superconductor ( bi , pb)@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 in the vicinity of the antinodal point in the superconducting state . using a parameterized self - energy function , it was possible to describe both the coherent and the incoherent spectral weight of the bonding and the antibonding band . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization effects can be assigned to a very strong coupling to the magnetic resonance mode and at higher energies to a bandwidth renormalization by a factor of two , probably caused by a coupling to a continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the present reevaluation of the arpes data allows to come to a more reliable determination of the value of the coupling strength of the charge carriers to the mode . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results for the dressing of the charge carriers are compared to theoretical models . </S>"
