    "in recent years considerable study has been given to the theory of self - organized criticality ( soc ) that explains avalanche dynamics in vast variety of systems type of sandpile model @xcite , intermittency in biological evolution @xcite , earthquakes and propagation of forest - fires , depinning transitions in random medium and so on ( see @xcite ) .",
    "without any special tuning of their external parameters , such systems evolve to a critical state that displays universality in both spatiotemporal behaviour and avalanche distribution over size @xmath0 and intensity @xmath1 .",
    "so , the latter is given by homogeneous function @xmath2 where a cutoff size @xmath3 is determined as @xmath4 @xmath5 is a critical intensity , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are critical exponents .",
    "such relations are obtained as result of making use of scaling - type arguments supplemented with extensive computer simulations @xcite as well as within framework of the theory of branching processes @xcite .",
    "these methods allow to find the magnitudes of the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , but as to the function @xmath8 in eq.([1 ] ) , it is known only that this function is a monotonically falling down .",
    "this work is devoted to determination of the scaled function @xmath8 within the framework of statistical theory that deals with avalanche ensemble in the course of soc progressing .",
    "the cornerstone of our approach is hierarchical representation of the avalanche ensemble that is embedded into ultrametric space corresponding to hierarchical landscape of the system energy @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.[sec2 ] deals with the theory of hierarchical coupling between elementary avalanches arising from the complexity of the phase space landscape of self - organized system .",
    "the time dependence of the probability of the global avalanche appearance is studied in sec.[sec3 ] .",
    "sec.[sec4 ] contains discussion of obtained results .",
    "let the maximum number of hierarchically subordinated avalanches @xmath9 be on the bottom hierarchical level @xmath10 where the avalanche intensity equals @xmath1 .",
    "correspondingly , there is the only avalanche of the intensity @xmath11 on the top level @xmath12 .",
    "the problem is to find the dependencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 that define the distribution of avalanche number and their intensity over hierarchical levels @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the first part of the problem can be approached in terms of geometry by representing the avalanche ensemble as a hierarchical cayley tree @xcite .",
    "the basic types of the trees are shown in fig.1 : regular tree with integer branching ratio @xmath16 , regular fibbonachi tree with fractional one @xmath17 , degenerate tree with the only branching node per level and the tree of our primary concern  irregular tree .",
    "let @xmath18 be the numbering index for the levels , so that @xmath18 increases from the top level to the bottom one .",
    "the variable @xmath19 then defines the distance in the ultrametric space @xcite .",
    "geometrically , objects of this space correspond to the nodes of the bottom level ( @xmath20 ) of a cayley tree . since the distance between the nodes is defined by the number of steps to a common ancestor",
    ", the distance is eventually the level number ( [ 17 ] ) , counted from the bottom .    as it can be seen in fig.1a , in the simplest case of regular tree with integer branching ratio @xmath16",
    "the number of avalanches @xmath21 exponentially decays to zero with the distance @xmath0 between them :    @xmath22    in eq.([18 ] ) the equality ( [ 17 ] ) is used and the avalanche number @xmath9 is related to the total number of levels @xmath23 . for the fibbonachi tree ( see fig .",
    "1b ) , where @xmath24 @xcite , we have @xmath25 when eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) is compared with eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) , it is clear that the exponential decay remains unaltered in the case of fractional branching ratio and characterizes the regularity of tree .    for the degenerate tree ( see fig.1c ) @xmath26 and eq.([17 ] ) provides the following linear dependence @xmath27 it can be shown that in the case of irregular tree , displayed in fig.1d , the power law dependence is realized : @xmath28 indeed , the latter can be regarded as an intermediate case between the exponential eqs.([18 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) and linear eq.([20 ] ) obtained for the limiting cases of regular and degenerate trees , respectively .",
    "formally , the approximation ( [ 21 ] ) means that a function @xmath29 defined on the self - similar set of hierarchically subordinated avalanches is homogeneous , @xmath30 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq.([21 ] ) in term of the distance :    @xmath31    now , let us define @xmath32 as total intensity of avalanches on the @xmath18-th level . if one considers the value @xmath33 as an effective density of some particles and the level number @xmath18 as a coordinate , then corresponding density of hierarchical current can be taken in the onsager - type form : @xmath34 here , within the multiplicative noise approach , the effective diffusion coefficient has form @xcite @xmath35 to depend on the constant @xmath36 and the exponent @xmath37 .",
    "the basic assumption of this section is that the total current @xmath38 of all avalanches at given hierarchical level is independent on the level number @xmath18 : @xmath39 inserting eqs.([22])-([24 ] ) into eq.([25 ] ) gives the total avalanches intensity on the level @xmath18 @xmath40 normalized by the maximum value @xmath41 . introducing the distance ( [ 17 ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 where the intensity at the bottom level @xmath10 is @xmath43    after generalizing eqs.([26 ] ) , ( [ 28 ] )",
    ", the following scaling relation can be assumed @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a slowly varying function . according to eqs.([23])-([25 ] ) , this function obeys the landau - khalatnikov equation : @xmath46 where one denotes @xmath47 and the effective potential is introduced @xmath48    as indicated in fig.2 , the potential @xmath49 reaches its maximum value @xmath50 at @xmath51 and decreases indefinitely at @xmath52 .",
    "so , in order to initiate the global avalanche formation , a low intensity avalanche with @xmath53 at the bottom level needs to penetrate the barrier @xmath54 of the potential ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "it implies fluctuation mechanism for the soc regime progressing provided that @xmath55 is a stochastic variable and we proceed with langevin - type equation derived from eq.([30 ] ) by adding a gaussian white noise to the right - hand side :    @xmath56    @xmath57    where the noise intensity @xmath58 equals the diffusion coefficient in eq.([24 ] ) .",
    "the usual way to study a set of solutions to the stochastic equation ( [ 33 ] ) is to introduce distribution function @xmath59 associated with the probability of solution s realization .",
    "it is known that @xmath59 obeys the fokker - planck equation @xcite : @xmath60 since there is no current at the equilibrium state ( @xmath61 ) , the corresponding distribution function of avalanche intensities at the bottom level @xmath62 is dictated by the potential ( [ 32 ] ) . in the case of non - equilibrium",
    "steady state the probability density @xmath63 does not depend on the hierarchical level variable @xmath64 and the current @xmath16 being constant , in compliance with the conservation law ( [ 25 ] ) , can take a non - zeroth value . from eq.([35 ] ) the stationary distribution then is expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution @xmath65 and the current @xmath16 @xcite :    @xmath66    where the boundary condition @xmath67 as @xmath68 is taken into account .",
    "given the intensity @xmath1 equation ( [ 37 ] ) allows the current @xmath16 to be found . in trying to do it , special consideration should be given to the fact that the intensity @xmath1 is bounded from below , @xmath69 , by a gap @xmath70 that is inherent in hierarchical ensemble of avalanches @xcite .",
    "indeed , after merging of avalanches within a hierarchical cluster of the size @xmath71 , all @xmath0 , such that @xmath72 , are appeared to be dropped out the consideration as well as low intensities with @xmath73 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the expression for the current @xmath16 then can be derived from eq.([37 ] ) with the second boundary condition @xmath74 .",
    "the result reads    @xmath75\\right\\}^{-1 } , \\label{38}\\ ] ]    where the factor @xmath76 gives the probability that fluctuation will surmount the barrier @xmath54 of the potential ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ 38 ] ) shows that in the case of small gap , @xmath77 , the current @xmath16 is about @xmath78 , but the current is doubled under @xmath79 .",
    "it can be understood if we picture the effect of the gap as a mirror that reflects diffusing particles at the point @xmath80 : if @xmath77 a particle penetrating the barrier can move along both directions , but in the case of @xmath79 the mirror is placed at the point corresponding to the top of the barrier and all particles go down the side where the intensity @xmath1 grows indefinitely .",
    "given the current @xmath16 the stationary distribution function @xmath81 is defined by eq.([37 ] ) , according to which , @xmath82 in the subcritical region @xmath53 , while in the supercritical range @xmath83 we have @xmath84 due to indefinite increase of @xmath85 . as far as the stationary distribution is concerned , it can be derived from the current definition ( [ 35 ] ) , where the last diffusion term is negligible for supercritical intensities : @xmath86 .",
    "the result is that the probability @xmath81 remains almost unaltered @xmath87 in the range from the critical value @xmath88 up to the boundary one @xmath89 and @xmath90 at @xmath91 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the growth of @xmath89 is governed by the equation @xmath92 that is a counterpart of the known gap - equation presenting the system behaviour below the critical value @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "since the above picture is essentially statistical , it enables the critical avalanche intensity @xmath88 for the transition point to be found . indeed ,",
    "when the definition of the macroscopic current @xmath38 in eq.([25 ] ) is compared to that of the microscopic current @xmath16 in eq.([35 ] ) , it is apparent that they differ from one another only by the factor @xmath93 dependent on the total number of avalanches @xmath9 . on this basis ,",
    "the last expression of eq.([31 ] ) and eq.([38 ] ) at @xmath94 give the desired result :    @xmath95    where the pre - exponent factor @xmath96 determines the probability of the barrier penetrating and can not be calculated within the framework of the presented approach . equation ( [ 41 ] ) bears a resemblance to the well - known result of the superconductivity bcs theory for the temperature of the phase transition and predicts the slow growth of the critical intensity @xmath88 of elementary avalanche with the hierarchical diffusion coefficient @xmath58 that plays the role of the parameter of effective interaction .",
    "since the ensemble of hierarchically subordinated avalanches represents a self - similar set , the probability distribution @xmath97 of avalanches in the course of soc process is a homogeneous function ( [ 1 ] ) , where @xmath98 is the stationary distribution of elementary avalanches considered in the previous section .",
    "physically , eq.([1 ] ) implies that the total intensity @xmath96 , being measured by the scale @xmath99 , equals the intensity of an elementary avalanche @xmath1 in accordance with eq.([28 ] ) .    in this section",
    "we are aimed to describe kinetics of the global avalanche formation produced by virtue of the hierarchical coupling between elementary avalanches . as it has been clarified in sec.[sec2 ] , this process can be conceived of as diffusion in ultrametric space that makes the distribution ( [ 1 ] ) mounted . in order to find the conditional probability @xmath100 that no global avalanche will appear at time @xmath101 one has to integrate over @xmath0 the distribution ( [ 1 ] ) weighted with the function @xmath102 descriptive of debay relaxation with the time @xmath103 governed by the barrier height @xmath14 ( @xmath104 is a microscopic time ) . by using the steepest descent method ,",
    "it is not difficult to derive the late time ( @xmath105 ) asymptotic formula @xmath106^{-\\tau},\\qquad t_{ef}\\equiv\\frac{\\tau}{b}\\left(\\frac{f}{d}\\right)^{1/b}t_{0}.",
    "\\label{44}\\ ] ] this equation has been obtained by assuming that the condition @xmath107 is met , where @xmath108 denotes the location of the maximum of integrand and obeys the equation @xmath109 taking into consideration the scaling relation ( [ 2 ] ) for the number of hierarchical levels @xmath23 , which is the cut - off parameter , we readily come to the conclusion that the condition is satisfied provided    @xmath110    so , the intensity @xmath1 in eqs.([44]),([45 ] ) can be replaced by the critical value @xmath88 . in accordance with eq.([44 ] ) , the probability @xmath111 of the global avalanche appearance logarithmically increases in time up to the value @xmath112 . in order for the probability @xmath113 to be non - negative",
    ", the factor @xmath96 in eq.([41 ] ) must be equal @xmath114 , whereas the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath58 must be bounded from above by the value @xmath115 .",
    "according to the presented picture , the initiated elementary avalanches form statistical ensemble of hierarchically subordinated objects , characterized by intensity @xmath1 and distance in ultrametric space @xmath0 ( the latter corresponds avalanche size @xcite ) .",
    "since the global avalanche formation is caused by effective diffusion in the space , then , similar to brownian particle with coordinate @xmath1 at time @xmath0 , the ensemble can be described by langevin equation ( [ 33 ] ) subjected to the noise eq.([34 ] ) with @xmath58 being the effective diffusion coefficient and corresponding to the fokker - planck equation ( [ 35 ] ) . the stationary intensity distribution and the steady - state current are given by eqs.([37 ] ) , ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "the condition of current conservation eq.([25 ] ) yields the avalanche intensity distribution ( [ 27 ] ) over hierarchical clusters in the ultrametric space .",
    "the ensemble of elementary avalanches , being weakly dependent on @xmath0 , is governed by the effective potential ( [ 32 ] ) that reaches its maximum at the critical intensity ( [ 41 ] ) ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "so , the global avalanche generation requires supercritical elementary avalanche intensity , @xmath116 , to surmount the barrier @xmath54 with the characteristic time ( cf .",
    "eq.([39 ] ) ) @xmath117 this picture bears some resemblance with the formation process of supercritical embryo in the theory of the first - order phase transitions @xcite , where in the course of transformation the next stage is the diffusion growth of the embryo .",
    "analogously , in the case under consideration the above growth implies an increase of the supercritical avalanche in intensity @xmath14 , eq.([27 ] ) , due to the diffusion growth of hierarchical cluster in ultrametric space . as a result of the total cluster formation , we have the logarithmically slow large time asymptotic for the probability of the global avalanche appearance : @xmath118^{-\\tau},\\qquad t_{ef}\\equiv(\\tau / b ) \\overline{\\cal p}^{1/\\tau}t_{0 } , \\label{50}\\ ] ] where time @xmath101 is counted from the instant @xmath119 , eq.([49 ] ) , and @xmath120 is the maximum probability that no global avalanche will occur @xmath121}. \\label{51}\\ ] ] from eq.([51 ] ) the probability is determined by the ratio of the noise intensity @xmath58 ( see eq.([34 ] ) ) and its maximum value @xmath122 .",
    "the key point is that the maximum probability @xmath123 of the global avalanche appearance is completely suppressed under high intensity variance in ensemble of elementary avalanches ( see fig.3 ) ."
