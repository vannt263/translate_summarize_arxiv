    "energy efficiency has become a major concern for cellular networks due to the explosive growth of data traffic . among the system elements , base stations ( bss )",
    "account for more than @xmath0 of the total energy consumption @xcite , calling for new approaches for bs operation . to this end ,",
    "one solution is to coordinate and optimize the activities of bss , and the paradigm of bss operation has been shifted from `` always on '' to `` always available '' @xcite .",
    "some underutilized bss with low traffic can be turned off , for example , to reduce the energy consumption , if the data traffic of the bss can be offloaded to other bss .",
    "another related scheme for energy saving is to organize the bss by clusters such that one cluster is active at a time .",
    "the cells within a cluster are in transmission if and only if the cluster is active . in this paper",
    ", we optimize cell cluster formation and the activation time duration of each cluster , with energy as the performance metric .",
    "there are a number of studies that consider energy saving by deactivating bss @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the periodic nature of cell s traffic , both temporally and spatially , is exploited .",
    "energy consumption is reduced by deactivating some bss when the traffic demand is low . if a bs is deactivated , its service coverage is taken care of by other neighboring bss that remain active . coordinated multi - point ( comp )",
    "transmission can be applied , see e.g. , @xcite , to avoid coverage holes .",
    "energy saving can also be gained by deactivating bss power amplifiers ( pas ) if the amount of traffic does not require fully continuous transmission . in the transmission mode ,",
    "the pas are accounted for most of the energy consumption .",
    "typically , 50 - 80% of the total energy of a bs is consumed by the pas @xcite . for long term evolution ( lte )",
    "systems , deactivating the pas can be done by adopting discontinuous transmission ( dtx ) at the bss , implemented by the use of almost blank subframe ( abs ) @xcite . in @xcite , performance evaluation of dtx",
    "is carried out for a realistic traffic scenario .    in bs scheduling",
    ", the bss are grouped into clusters that potentially can overlap , such that one cluster is active ( i.e. , used for transmission ) at a time , and a schedule is designed to optimize the use of clusters to serve the user demand with minimum energy . in @xcite , the authors assessed the performance of coordinated scheduling of bs activation . in this case ,",
    "inter - bs coordination is carried out for groups of three cells , with pre - defined and fixed deactivation period of each bs . in @xcite , the authors proposed a coordinated activation scheme , in which the bss are split into multiple bs groups .",
    "for each group , the bss switch between activation and deactivation according to a pre - defined pattern .",
    "simulation results in @xcite show that the scheme leads to 40% less energy consumption . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered four bs deactivation patterns , to allow for progressively deactivating bss to improve energy efficiency , while maintaining the quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "energy saving is achieved by dynamically selecting the four patterns adaptively depending on the traffic demand .",
    "another related topic is transmission scheduling in wireless ad hoc and mesh networks ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "the task is to organize links into groups , and determine the number of time slots assigned to each group , in order to meet the demand with minimum time ( a.k.a .",
    "minimum - length scheduling ) .",
    "a subset of links can form a group if and only if the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the receivers meets a given threshold . a problem generalization to continuous rates",
    "is studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied transmission scheduling in mesh networks with a performance metric that weights together time and energy .",
    "most of the previous works for coordinated bs activation focus on saving energy enabled by scenarios with relatively low user demand . for the more general scenario with no specific assumption on user demand level ,",
    "energy - optimal bs scheduling for delivering the demand within a strict time limit is challenging , due to the fact that the achievable transmission rates within each cell are constrained by the inter - cell interference .",
    "for lte networks , the transmission rates ( i.e. , demand delivered per time unit ) in different cells are inherently coupled with each other due to mutual interference . to characterize the achievable rates , we adopt the coupling model in @xcite for cell load - dependent sinr . here",
    ", cell load refers to the utilization level of the time - spectrum resource units ( rus ) in orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) .",
    "the cell load levels are coupled , i.e. , they influence each other .",
    "namely , because the load reflects the amount of use of rus for transmission , the inter - cell interference generated by a cell to another cell depends on the load of the former , and the interference , in its turn , has impact on the load level of the latter . in the load - coupling model , the dependency relation of the cell load levels is taken into account in the sinr computation . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", energy - efficient bs clustering and scheduling , subject to maximum delay and rate characterization based on the coupling relation among cells , has not been investigated in the literature .    in this paper , we formulate , analyze , and solve energy - efficient cell clustering and scheduling ( ) , where the cells are required to serve a target amount of data for the users within a time limit to maintain an appropriate level of qos , while considering the coupling relation among cells due to interference .",
    "each cluster is a subset of cells that are in simultaneous transmission mode , when the cluster is active . instead of pre - defined clusters , in cell clustering as well as",
    "cluster activation times are optimized . within a cell ,",
    "the achievable rate vectors for the cell s users , taking into account inter - cell interference , is not unique but form a rate region .",
    "thus solving also involves the selection of rate vectors .",
    "we present the following contributions .",
    "first , we formulate and prove its np - hardness .",
    "a problem is called non - deterministic polynomial - time hard , or np - hard in short , if it is at least as difficult as a large class of computational problems referred to as np , and , thus far , no polynomial - time algorithms exist for np - hard problems . as the next contribution ,",
    "we present and prove a theoretical result to enable to confine the consideration of rate vectors to a finite set without loss of optimality . on the algorithmic side ,",
    "we show how column generation @xcite facilitates problem solving , and thereby derive an algorithm for optimal cell clustering and scheduling ( ) to approach the global optimum .",
    "column generation is an optimization method , in which a mathematical model is successively expanded with new variables , such that the objective function gets improved after each expansion , until the global optimum is reached . by our complexity results of computational intractability , for large networks solving optimally is challenging .",
    "we then introduce our notion of locally enumerating interference , that is , for each bs , the rate evaluation of its users considers a selected small set of nearby bss as sources of interference , utilizing the fact that interference from distant bss is insignificant . using this notion , we present a local - enumeration - based bounding scheme ( ) , providing lower and upper bounds on the global optimum of minimum energy , as well as enabling to deal with the trade - off between optimality and the combinatorial nature of cluster formation .",
    "the bounds , in turn , serve the purpose of gauging the deviation from optimality . moreover , from , we derive a near - optimal cluster scheduling approach ( ) .",
    "we present numerical results to illustrate the performance of the proposed approaches .",
    "the results show significant energy savings by , and the near optimality of solutions enabled by and .",
    "we remark that , even though regular , hexagon - shaped cells are used for performance evaluation for the purpose of comparative study , our system model and the optimization approaches do not impose any topological assumption , and hence they are generally applicable to any given cellular network layout .",

    "thus , finding the column with the minimum reduced cost can be performed for one cluster at a time . for each cluster @xmath216 ,",
    "the task is to find the rate vector index @xmath217 for which the reduced cost attains its minimum for the given cluster .",
    "recall that the cardinality of @xmath101 is @xmath218 , which can be very large .",

    "@xmath55    the computational bottleneck of is on the pricing problem @xmath221 . even if is linear , to ensure global optimality needs to be solved for all clusters , and the number of clusters is exponential in the network size .",
    "to this end , in the next section we develop an algorithm with a control parameter for the trade - off between complexity and optimality .",

    "if there is a new user , adding zero as the rate for this user in the current rate vectors , along with the current scheduling solution at hand ( which satisfies the demands of all other users ) , together achieve the warm - start effect .",
    "the challenge in dealing with the complexity of the pricing problem lies in the coupling relation between cells .",
    "specifically , the interference and hence the rate region of one cell depend on the cluster composition , and the number of possible clusters is exponential in the number of bss .",
    "we introduce a concept that we refer to as local enumeration .",
    "the notion is to confine , for each cell , the interference consideration to its local neighborhood .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that , for any bs , the interference experienced is dominated by the bss nearby , whereas interference coming from more remote bss is insignificant . for a cluster and any of its cells , inter - cell interference originates from all other cells in the cluster .",
    "suppose we need to determine the cells to be grouped together to form a new cluster in some optimization process ( e.g. , solving the pricing problem in section  [ sec : pricing ] ) .",
    "for each candidate cell , there are @xmath230 possible interference scenarios , depending on which of the remaining @xmath231 cells are to be included in the same cluster .",
    "if we only account for which cells nearby are included in the cluster in interference calculation , the number of combinations of interference scenarios to be considered becomes much smaller . as will be clear later on , the size of the local neighborhood acts as a control parameter for the trade - off between the accuracy of interference estimation and complexity reduction .",
    "moreover , the solution scheme via local enumeration allows to compute upper and lower bounds to the global optimum of , as well as a near - optimal bs clustering and scheduling solution .      in local enumeration , the interference calculation of each cell is restricted to a selected set of cells that are nearby . for cell @xmath10 ,",
