    "the renewed interest in spin - peierls ( sp ) systems arises from the recently characterized compounds tiox ( x = cl , br ) .",
    "tiocl is a quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet with strong spin - phonon coupling .",
    "different than the previously studied organic and inorganic sp systems , tiox has an intermediate incommensurate phase between the dimerized and the uniform ones .",
    "motivated by a phenomenological landau - ginzburg calculation @xcite , we have recently studied a model of heisenberg chains coupled to phonons @xcite . as a simplified phononic model we had taken arrays of harmonic chains inserted in an anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "the transversal elastic coupling arising in this geometry introduces a degeneration of the phonon mode at the zone boundary ( zb ) .",
    "this degeneration induces a linear dependency of the phononic dispersion near the zb which is different than the usual flat dispersion close to the zb .",
    "we had shown that this difference is at the heart of the fact that tiox undergoes an instability from the high temperature uniform phase to an incommensurate phase instead of a dimerized one .    in spite of the fact that the transition can be accounted by an adiabatic treatment of the phonons",
    ", the temperature scale seems to be strongly renormalized .",
    "in fact , by taking the spin - phonon coupling and the bare phonon frequency obtained at the zb from ab - initio calculations , neither the phononic dispersion measured at @xmath0 nor the wave vector of the incommensuration could be reproduced . by increasing the spin - phonon coupling in order to solve the previous problem , the critical temperature turned out to be much bigger than the experimental one @xcite .    in the present work we investigate the consequences of the inclusion of the dynamics of the phonons .",
    "we treat the effective interchain coupling generated by integrating out the phonons within a mean field _ random phase approximation _ ( rpa ) framework recently developed @xcite .",
    "we show that a consistent description of the dimerized phase , the renormalization of the phonons by their interaction with the magnetism , and the characteristics of the incommensurate - uniform transition are well accounted within this approach .",
    "we consider the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the bilayer of tiocl .",
    "this simplified model included the spin chains coupled to phonons and the elastic springs defined on an anisotropic triangular lattice .",
    "those are the essential ingredients for the incommensurate transition as previously shown @xcite .",
    "the model is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] .     schematic representation of our simplified model .",
    "only ti atoms are included over the @xmath1 plane .",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the harmonic force constants acting when two atoms in the same chain , in neighboring chains and in next - nearest neighbor chains respectively move from their equilibrium position . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the base vectors .",
    "the coordinate of an atom is given by @xmath7 . ]    here , we have added a transversal elastic interaction between ions in second neighbor chains with spring constant @xmath4 . whereas it does not play any role in the adiabatic treatment",
    ", we will show that it is essential to account for a finite temperature phase transition in our treatment with nonadiabatic phonons .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath8\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{k_{2}}{2 } ( u_{i , j}-u_{i-1,j+2})^2 ) \\rbrace + \\sum_{i , j } [ j + \\alpha ( u_{i , j}-u_{i+1,j})]\\,\\textbf{s}_{i , j } \\cdot \\textbf{s}_{i+1,j},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the momentum of the atom @xmath10 ( the integer indexes identifying an atom in the bravais lattice of fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] ) , @xmath11 are the displacements from the equilibrium positions along the direction of the magnetic chains , @xmath12 are spin-@xmath13 operators with exchange constant @xmath14 along the y - axis of a non - deformed underlying lattice , @xmath15 is the spin - phonon coupling constant , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the harmonic force constants as shown in fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] .",
    "we now consider the low temperature dimerized phase .",
    "it is customary to integrate out the phononic coordinates by going to a path integral formulation .",
    "the generated effective theory contains retarded interactions between spin - spin dimers along the chain and between different ones .",
    "its low energy behavior can be studied by bosonization in similar steps as in ref .",
    "furthermore , a mean field treatment of the effective interchain interaction reduces the problem to a one - chain problem .",
    "the mean field order parameter is @xmath16 describing the magnetic dimerization along the chains . at low temperatures we expect a uniformly dimerized phase ,",
    "thus we take @xmath17 to be position independent .",
    "the resulting one - chain bosonized problem corresponds to a massive sine - gordon theory which can be exactly solved . solving the mean field equation by minimizing the total energy with respect to @xmath17",
    ", we obtain for the magnetic gap @xmath18 with @xmath19 which distinguishes our problem from the square lattice geometry . in eq .",
    "( [ deltaj ] ) , @xmath20 is the adimensional spin - phonon coupling .",
    "note that @xmath21 appears in @xmath22 instead of @xmath2 alone because it gives the phononic frequency at @xmath23 for our model .",
    "furthermore , the constant @xmath24 is model independent .",
    "however , it depends on the nonuniversal constant @xmath25 necessary in the bosonization procedure .",
    "we discuss a procedure to fix @xmath22 independently of the value of this constant .",
    "let us analyze the form of eq .",
    "( [ deltaj ] ) for limiting values of @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath26 , then @xmath27 , i.e. no gap is present and the system does not have a dimerized phase because no coherent dimerization is fixed by the interchain coupling .",
    "this is different than the results of the adiabatic approach and was the reason to include @xmath4 in the model",
    ". it can be present from the original microscopic phononic model or it could be generated ( at least partially ) in the low energy hamiltonian as an effective interaction . in the opposite limit @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 which is the result of the adiabatic approach @xcite .",
    "let us fix @xmath30 to their experimental values and look for the spin - phonon coupling in the adiabatic ( @xmath31 ) and nonadiabatic ( @xmath22 ) calculations .",
    "we have @xmath32 depending on the bare phononic parameters . in the next section",
    "we obtain @xmath33 by fitting the renormalized phonons to the ones measured in x - ray experiments at @xmath0 . moreover @xmath34 has been obtained by ab - initio electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 , thus the nonadiabatic approach requires a bigger spin - phonon coupling to produce the same spin gap .",
    "we will check this value in the next section .",
    "finally , the critical temperature can be obtained as @xmath36 where @xmath25 has been obtained from the procedure of ref .",
    "we obtain @xmath37 which has to be compared with @xmath38 , the dimerized - incommensurate transition temperature .",
    "however , our @xmath39 corresponds to the stability limit of the dimerized phase toward an uniform one , and should be taken as an upper limit .",
    "in fact , as we have recently shown for the xy model @xcite , our model will undertake a first order phase transition to an incommensurate phase at a lower temperature than @xmath39 .",
    "note that our value for @xmath39 coincides with the experimental value of @xmath40 , which corresponds to the uniform - incommensurate transition .",
    "in the high temperature uniform phase , the order parameter @xmath41 vanishes .",
    "this is essential to extend the previous approach to the dynamical correlation functions . indeed , to compare with x - ray scattering data , the dynamical structure factor @xmath42 has to be determined .",
    "it is proportional to the phononic retarded green function @xmath43 . following the canonical work of cross and fisher ( cf ) @xcite ,",
    "we have recently obtained @xmath43 by rpa _ on the spin phonon coupling _ @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to fluctuations over the adiabatic approximation for the phonons .",
    "the softening of an incommensurate phonon was obtained , signaling the uniform - incommensurate transition . in order to go beyond this approach to discuss the nonadiabatic effects",
    ", we use the result of ref .",
    "@xcite where the rpa is taken _ on the effective interchain coupling _ generated by the integration of the phonons .",
    "this follows the same line of reasoning of the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ wvsq ] we show the evolution with temperature of the dressed phonon frequencies obtained from the position of the peaks of @xmath44",
    ".     temperature evolution of the dressed phonon frequencies along the ( @xmath45 ) path , at @xmath46 , @xmath0 and @xmath47 .",
    "the continuous lines correspond to the nonadiabatic approach while the dashed ones correspond to the adiabatic - cf approach .",
    "the arrows signal the incommensurate wave vector at the transition point .",
    "the circles show the experimental frequencies at @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "note that the bare frequencies are the same in both cases but the spin - phonon interaction is different as discussed in the text . ]    the high temperature limit corresponds to the bare phononic dispersion .",
    "the frequency at the zb , @xmath49 , has been fixed to the one obtained from ab - initio calculations @xcite for the degenerate @xmath50 , @xmath51 modes at @xmath52 .",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the value of @xmath4 have been determined by fitting the peaks to the ones measured in inelastic x - ray experiments @xcite at @xmath0 and the temperature of the incommensurate transition .",
    "our best fit is shown by continuous lines in the figure . once the parameters have been fixed , we are able to calculate @xmath53 , the value used in the previous section .",
    "we also obtain @xmath54 for the incommensurate wave vector at the transition temperature which is signaled by the continuous arrow in the figure .",
    "this value reproduces very well the one measured by elastic x - ray scattering @xcite for the incommensuration in the direction of the magnetic chains .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ wvsq ] has been obtained using the @xmath55 obtained from the low temperature phase .",
    "if , instead of this value , we use @xmath34 extracted from the adiabatic approach , not a good fitting to the measured phonons at @xmath48 neither the value of the incommensuration can be obtained .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ wvsq ] show the dressed frequencies obtained from the rpa a la cf , i.e. the adiabatic approach , with the previously fitted phononic parameters and @xmath34 .",
    "we see that not a good fitting is obtained .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the effects of the inclusion of nonadiabatic phonons on a simple model for tiocl .",
    "we have found that the spin - phonon coupling is strongly renormalized in relation to the one which arises from an adiabatic treatment of the phonons .",
    "we used the bare phonon frequency obtained by ab - initio calculations and fitted the elastic spring constants to obtain the experimental phononic frequencies measured at @xmath48 by inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "in contrast to the adiabatic treatment , we obtain a good prediction for the uniform - incommensurate transition temperature and for the incommensurate wave vector .",
