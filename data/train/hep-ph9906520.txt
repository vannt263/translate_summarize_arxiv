    "recent measurements of the @xmath1 reaction cross section at energies in the vicinity of the @xmath2 resonance reached by the cmd-2 team in novosibirsk have revealed the @xmath0 interference phase @xmath7 @xcite , provided the phases of the complex propagators of @xmath4 and @xmath6 mesons are properly included : @xmath8 @xmath9 being a real positive number , and @xmath10 denoting the contribution of the nonresonant background .",

    "we will demonstrate that @xmath15 can be calculated in a way that is practically independent of the specific model of @xmath0 mixing . as will become clear , this is due to the compensation between the @xmath16 state contribution to the @xmath0 mixing amplitude , and the direct transition .",
