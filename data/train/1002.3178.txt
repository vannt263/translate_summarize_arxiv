    "applications include the modeling of internal waves in deep water @xcite , and also the modeling of atmospheric waves like the dramatic `` morning glory '' phenomenon of northeastern australia @xcite .",
    "the relevant cauchy problem is to determine the solution @xmath4 of subject to a suitable initial condition @xmath5 given for all @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is a measure of the relative strength of the dispersive and nonlinear effects in the system . in many applications",
    "one thinks of @xmath7 as a small parameter in part because numerical experiments show that in this situation the finite - time formation of a shock wave ( gradient catastrophe ) in the formal limiting equation ( obtained simply by setting @xmath8 in ) is dispersively regularized by the generation of a smoothly modulated train of approximately periodic traveling waves , which correspond to so - called undular bores frequently observed in the evolution of physical internal waves .",
    "snapshots from the solution of a cauchy problem for illustrating the averted shock and onset of an undular bore are shown in figure  [ fig : numerics1 ] .    .",
    "bottom row : @xmath9 . in both cases",
    "the initial condition is the same : @xmath10 . _ _ ]    these figures clearly show that the mathematical description of the undular bore consists of waves of amplitude independent of @xmath7 and wavelength approximately proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to the asymptotic analysis of the solution of the cauchy problem with @xmath7-independent initial data @xmath11 in the limit @xmath12 as the _ zero - dispersion limit_.      a more famous nonlinear dispersive wave equation is the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xmath13 a model for long surface waves on shallow water among a wide variety of other physical phenomena .",
    "when @xmath1 is small , this equation displays qualitatively similar behavior to that just illustrated for the bo equation : the dispersive term arrests the shock in the @xmath8 equation with the formation of a train of waves of amplitude approximately independent of @xmath7 and wavelength proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the modeling of the zero - dispersion limit for the kdv equation has a long history going back to the work of whitham @xcite who used the method of averaging to propose a nonlinear hyperbolic system of three partial differential equations to describe the modulational variables ( _ e.g. _ slowly - varying amplitude , mean , and wavelength of the wavetrain ) .",
    "whitham noted that the system of modulation equations he obtained had the nongeneric property that by choice of special dependent variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , it could be written in so - called riemann invariant form , in which the three equations are only coupled through the characteristic velocities : @xmath17 later , gurevich and pitaevskii @xcite considered the problem of patching together solutions of whitham s modulational system with solutions of the formal limiting equation ( obtained by setting @xmath8 in ) at two moving boundary points that delineate the oscillation zone ; their goal was to provide a reasonable global approximation scheme for the solution of the initial - value problem for the kdv equation in the zero - dispersion limit subject to given initial data @xmath18 independent of @xmath7 .",
    "in the meantime , it was of course discovered that the kdv equation is a completely integrable system , posessing a compatible structure now called a _",
    "lax pair _ and a coincident solution procedure for addressing the cauchy ( initial - value ) problem : the _ inverse - scattering transform_. this development suggested that the methodology invented by whitham could perhaps be placed on completely rigorous mathematical footing .",
    "after the exact periodic ( and quasiperiodic ) solutions of the kdv equation were given a spectral interpretation by its and matveev @xcite and dubrovin , matveev , and novikov @xcite , the whitham modulation equations themselves were reinterpreted within the framework of integrability by flaschka , forest , and mclaughlin @xcite .",
    "( in particular this work made clear the reason why whitham s equations could be placed in riemann invariant form ; it is a consequence of integrability . )",
    "the task that remained in the use of integrable machinery to study the zero - dispersion limit of the kdv equation was to rigorously analyze the cauchy problem using the inverse - scattering transform .",
    "the first step in this program was taken by lax and levermore @xcite who considered positive initial data @xmath19 rapidly decaying to zero for large @xmath20 .",
    "they used wkb methods to argue that the schrdinger operator with potential @xmath21 that arises in the scattering theory is approximately reflectionless in the limit @xmath12 . on an _ ad - hoc _",
    "basis they replaced the true scattering data by its wkb analogue , retaining only contributions from a set of @xmath22 discrete eigenvalues which are approximated by a bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , which amounts to replacing the solution @xmath23 of the cauchy problem with another solution @xmath24 of having @xmath7-dependent initial data close to @xmath25 .",
    "in this situation , the inverse - scattering procedure reduces to finite - dimensional ( of dimension @xmath26 ) linear algebra , and in fact the solution obtained by cramer s rule can be reduced to the determinantal formula @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a positive - definite real symmetric matrix of dimension @xmath29 .",
    "lax and levermore then established the existence of the limit of @xmath30 as @xmath12 , uniformly on compact subsets of the @xmath31-plane .",
    "this yields weak convergence of @xmath24 by differentiation of the limit function with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the lax - levermore method is to expand the determinant @xmath33 in principal minors indexed by subsets of the set of eigenvalues ; noting that each term is positive they showed that the sum of terms is asymptotically dominated by its largest term , and they further approximated this discrete optimization problem with an @xmath7-independent ( limiting ) convex variational problem , explicitly parametrized by @xmath32 and @xmath34 , for measures .",
    "the weak zero - dispersion limit of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation is therefore encoded implicitly in the solution of this variational problem .",
    "the lax - levermore method reproduces the specified initial data @xmath19 at @xmath35 as @xmath12 , which establishes validity , in a certain sense , of the wkb - based spectral approximation procedure in the first step .",
    "later , venakides @xcite was able to extend the method of lax and levermore to higher order , capturing the form of the oscillations that are averaged out in the weak limit .",
    "this work at last made clear that the solution of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation with smooth , @xmath7-independent initial data @xmath19 really does generate after some fixed breaking time a train of high - frequency waves of exactly the kind originally considered without complete justification by whitham .",
    "more recently , the powerful steepest - descent method for matrix riemann - hilbert problems developed by deift and zhou was used to analyze the zero - dispersion limit for the kdv equation @xcite .",
    "this technique is best viewed as a tool for converting weak asymptotics ( the solution of the lax - levermore variational problem ) into strong asymptotics ( an improvement of the venakides asymptotics in which the phase of the waveform is accurate to very high order ) .",
    "it turns out that the bo equation is also an integrable equation , in the sense that it has a representation as the compatibility condition of an overdetermined lax pair of linear problems @xcite .",
    "in fact , both bo and kdv equations may be viewed as limiting cases ( as depth of a fluid layer tends to infinity and zero , respectively ) of the so - called intermediate long - wave equation @xcite , itself an integrable system for arbitrary layer depth . however , the integrable structure of the bo equation is markedly different from that of the kdv equation . in particular ,",
    "the nonlocality in the equation due to the presence of the hilbert transform is mirrored in a certain nonlocality of the scattering and inverse - scattering problems . in place of the spectral theory of the selfadjoint schrdinger ( sturm - liouville ) differential operator one has to work with the spectral theory of the nonlocal operator @xmath36(x):=\\lim_{\\delta\\downarrow 0}\\frac{1}{2\\pi i } \\int_\\mathbb{r}\\frac{f(y ) } { y - x - i\\delta}\\,dy .",
    "\\label{eq : loperator}\\ ] ] here , the operator @xmath37 is the selfadjoint orthogonal projection from @xmath38 onto the hardy space of the upper half - plane , the hilbert space on which @xmath39 is selfadjoint , and @xmath40 denotes the operator of multiplication by @xmath41 .",
    "certainly a key step forward in the theory of the zero - dispersion limit was taken by dobrokhotov and krichever @xcite who noted that the second ( time evolution ) equation in the lax pair for the bo equation ( see below ) is simply a time - dependent schrdinger equation whose potential is a function with an analytic continuation from the real @xmath32-axis into the upper half - plane and were able to adapt a pre - existing construction of `` integrable '' potentials for this equation to the appropriate hardy - space setting .",
    "this allowed them to construct , from the lax pair , a large family of periodic traveling wave solutions of the bo equation , along with quasiperiodic generalizations .",
    "remarkably , unlike the corresponding exact solutions of the kdv equation which are highly transcendental objects constructed from riemann theta functions of hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus , the periodic and quasiperiodic solutions of the bo equation turn out to be simple rational functions of @xmath42 exponential phases @xmath43 . in the same paper ,",
    "dobrokhotov and krichever also carried out for the bo equation the analogue of the calculation of flaschka , forest , and mclaughlin @xcite , deriving by multiphase averaging a system of equations governing the modulational variables for a slowly - varying train of @xmath42-phase waves . here",
    "we arrive at a second remarkable fact : not only can the modulation equations be written in riemann invariant form , they are completely diagonal : @xmath44 ( the case of @xmath45 corresponds to simple traveling waves ) . this again should be contrasted with the situation for the kdv equation in which the characteristic velocities not only provide coupling among the fields but also are transcendental functions of the fields written in terms of ratios of complete hyperelliptic integrals .",
    "the analogue for the bo equation of the matching procedure developed by gurevich and pitaevskii @xcite to describe the evolution of a dispersive shock was independently described by matsuno @xcite and by jorge , minzoni , and smyth @xcite .",
    "this matching procedure provides a reasonable approach to the cauchy problem for the benjamin - ono equation with fixed initial data @xmath5 when @xmath46 , but it is based on formal asymptotics . in @xcite , matsuno writes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ from a rigorously mathematical point of view , however , the various results presented in this paper should be justified on the basis of an exact method of solution such as [ the inverse - scattering transform ] , or an analog of the lax - levermore theory for the kdv equation . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it is our intention in this paper to provide exactly such a justification , by developing a new method that does for the bo cauchy problem exactly what the lax - levermore method does for the kdv cauchy problem .",
    "the main result of our analysis is remarkably easy to state , but first we need to recall some basic facts concerning the equation obtained from simply by setting @xmath8 .",
    "recall that while for general sufficiently smooth initial data @xmath47 the inviscid burgers equation @xmath48 does not have a global solution as a function due to gradient catastrophe ( shock formation ) in finite time , it does have a global solution as a real multi - sheeted surface over the @xmath31-plane ; indeed this is the construction of the method of characteristics .",
    "the sheets of this surface are obtained as the real solutions of the implicit equation @xmath49 and by implicit differentiation it is easy to verify that away from singularities each sheet of the surface is a function @xmath50 that satisfies .",
    "a simple consequence of the implicit function theorem is that for sufficiently small @xmath51 there is a unique solution of for all @xmath6 .",
    "new sheets of the multivalued solution are born from _ breaking points _ in the @xmath31-plane that are in one - to - one correspondence with generic inflection points @xmath52 of @xmath53 for which @xmath54 but @xmath55 . if @xmath56 is such a point , then the corresponding breaking point is given by @xmath57 each such breaking point is the location of a pitchfork bifurcation for @xmath58 with respect to @xmath34 holding @xmath59 fixed , with two new branches emerging as @xmath51 increases .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath60 is a bounded function of total integral zero , the solution of the cauchy problem for is classical for @xmath61 note that under our assumptions on @xmath60 we have @xmath62 . also , @xmath63 is the supremum of all @xmath64 while @xmath65 is the infimum of all @xmath66 .",
    "when we consider the cauchy problem for @xmath67 , we will refer to @xmath68 as the _ breaking time_.    for @xmath69 there are _ caustic curves _ @xmath70 with limiting values as @xmath71 given by @xmath72 that bound the triply - folded region emerging from @xmath73 .",
    "the caustic curves correspond to double roots of , and crossing one of them at a generic point results in a change in the number of sheets by exactly two . except along the union of the caustic curves and the breaking points from which they emerge , the number of solutions of is always odd , and all are simple roots .",
    "see figure  [ fig : causticsannotated ] .     and @xmath74 the number of solutions of is of the form @xmath75 , and these solutions are simple roots . for this figure , @xmath76 .",
    "_ _ ]    for the initial data @xmath10 used in figure  [ fig : numerics1 ] , the breaking time before which there is a unique solution for all @xmath6 and after which there is an expanding interval in which there are three solutions , is exactly @xmath77 .",

    "middle : @xmath78 .",
    "right : @xmath79 . before the breaking time as well as",
    "afterwards but outside the oscillation interval there is only one solution branch and hence no difference between the red and black curves . _ _ ]    our result is then the following .",
    "[ maintheorem ] let @xmath80 be the branches of the multivalued ( method of characteristics ) solution of the inviscid burgers equation subject to an admissible initial condition @xmath81 .",
    "then , the weak @xmath38 ( in @xmath32 ) limit of @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 uniformly for @xmath34 in arbitrary bounded intervals .",
    "note that the right - hand side extends by continuity to the caustic curves .",
    "the signed sum of branches that is the weak limit is illustrated with red curves in figure  [ fig : numerics2 ] for the same initial data as in figure  [ fig : numerics1 ] .",
    "of course convergence in the weak @xmath38 ( in @xmath32 ) topology means that for every @xmath84 , we have @xmath85v(x)\\,dx\\ ] ] with the limit being uniform with respect to @xmath34 in arbitrary bounded intervals .",
    "thus , the weak limit essentially smooths out the rapid oscillations seen in figure  [ fig : numerics1 ] and ( if we think of @xmath86 as the indicator function of a mesoscale interval ) represents a kind of local average in @xmath32 .",
    "what it means for an initial condition to be admissible will be explained later ( see definition  [ def : admissible ] ) . here",

    "see definition  [ def : modified ] for more details .",
    "this modification of the initial data is an analogue of the replacement of the true scattering data by its reflectionless wkb approximation in the lax - levermore theory .    for @xmath34 before the breaking time @xmath89 for burgers equation , the weak limit guaranteed by theorem  [ maintheorem ] may be strengthened as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 for all @xmath6 ( that is , the solution @xmath92 of burgers equation with initial data @xmath11 is classical ) .",
    "then @xmath93 with the limit being in the ( strong ) @xmath94 topology .",
    "[ corr : strong ]    it should be pointed out that the weak limit formula is much more explicit than the corresponding formula found by lax and levermore @xcite for the weak zero - dispersion limit of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation .",
    "indeed , the latter requires the solution , for each @xmath32 and @xmath34 , of a constrained functional variational problem , which can be solved in closed form only for the simplest initial data .",
    "as we will now see , there are several classical wave propagation problems whose asymptotic behavior can be reduced to the multivalued solution of burgers equation ; however , even these simple problems involve more complicated schemes for combining the solution branches than that exhibited in the simple formula .",
    "after we introduce the necessary framework for our study ( the inverse - scattering transform for the bo equation ) in  [ sec : background ] , we will analyze the direct scattering map in the zero - dispersion limit in  [ sec : direct ]",

    "[ sec : corollary ] we prove corollary  [ corr : strong ] , and then in  [ sec : numerics ] we will illustrate our results with numerical calculations and address the relation between @xmath82 and the true solution @xmath4 of the cauchy problem for the bo equation with initial data @xmath53 .",
    "some comments about our continuing work can be found in the conclusion ,  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "but before we embark on our study of the bo equation , we pause to consider some familiar analogues of theorem  [ maintheorem ] .",
    "the key role played in the zero - dispersion limit of the bo cauchy problem by the multivalued solution of the equation with the same initial data is reminiscent of two basic example problems from the theory of linear and nonlinear waves .",
    "the burgers equation with viscosity @xmath1 is the nonlinear wave equation @xmath95 and we take fixed initial data @xmath96 .",
    "as is well - known , this cauchy problem is solved by the cole - hopf transformation , leading to the exact solution formula @xmath97 where the exponent function is defined as @xmath98 one examines the asymptotic behavior in the limit @xmath99 by using laplace s method to analyze the integrals ( see @xcite ,  3.6 ) .",
    "the dominant contributions to the integrals come from neighborhoods of points @xmath100 at which @xmath101 achieves its maximum value .",
    "the critical points of @xmath102 satisfy @xmath103 .",
    "writing @xmath104 and applying @xmath53 to both sides gives the equation , so the critical points correspond to the sheets of the multivalued solution of the ( inviscid ) burgers equation with initial data @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath32 and @xmath34 are such that there is just one sheet , then the unique critical point is the global maximizer of @xmath102 and laplace s method gives the result that @xmath105 converges ( strongly , pointwise in @xmath32 and @xmath34 ) to @xmath106 . on the other hand",
    ", if there are @xmath107 sheets , then for generic @xmath31 exactly one of them corresponds to the global maximum of @xmath102 , and laplace s method predicts that @xmath105 will converge to the maximizing sheet .",
    "shocks appear in the small viscosity limit as curves in the @xmath31-plane along which there are jump discontinuities of the pointwise limit corresponding to sudden changes in the choice of sheet that maximizes the exponent @xmath102 .",
    "to summarize , we have the formula @xmath108 for @xmath31 not on a shock .",
    "thus , one sees that for the zero - viscosity limit of the viscous burgers equation , different sheets of the multivalued solution of the formal limiting cauchy problem ( set @xmath8 ) provide the strong limit of @xmath105 for different @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , the choice of sheet requires the solution of a discrete maximization problem parametrized by @xmath32 and @xmath34 , making the limiting behavior harder to calculate than the weak zero - dispersion limit of the bo equation .      in this problem ,",
    "one considers the equation @xmath109 for small @xmath1 , subject to initial data of wkb form @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 real - valued and independent of @xmath7 . for suitable @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    ", the solution to this problem can be written as an integral @xmath113 the dominant contributions to the solution are calculated via the method of stationary phase ( see @xcite ,  5.6 ) , and these come from small neighborhoods of points @xmath52 satisfying @xmath114 , that is , solutions @xmath52 of the implicit equation @xmath115 . evaluating the function @xmath116 on both sides of this equation and making the substitution @xmath117 ,",
    "one arrives at the equivalent form where @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the branches of the multivalued solution of burgers equation with initial condition @xmath53 correspond to stationary phase points @xmath52 that yield the leading term of the solution @xmath119 in the semiclassical limit @xmath12 . unlike in the analysis of laplace - type integrals , where only the critical points corresponding to maxima matter in the limit , for oscillatory integrals all stationary phase points contribute to the leading - order behavior , and therefore we have an asymptotic representation of @xmath119 as a sum over branches @xmath120 of the multivalued solution of burgers equation with initial data @xmath53 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 are slowly - varying positive amplitudes given by @xmath123 and @xmath124 are rapidly - varying real phases given by @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "a more explicit connection with the multivalued solution of burgers equation may be obtained by introducing the quantity @xmath127 which is the fluid velocity in madelung s interpretation of the wave function @xmath128 as describing a quantum - corrected fluid motion . under the condition that the error term in becomes @xmath129 after differentiation with respect to @xmath32 , some easy calculations show that implies @xmath130 it is then easy to see that if @xmath91 , @xmath105 converges strongly pointwise to @xmath131 , the unique solution ( for this @xmath32 and @xmath34 , anyway ) of burgers equation . on the other hand , if @xmath132 , then there are interference effects among the terms in the sums and these lead to rapid oscillations with the effect that @xmath105 no longer converges in the pointwise sense as @xmath12",
    ". however , it does converge in the weak topology .",
    "the weak limit may be computed by multiphase averaging , which we illustrate in the case @xmath133 .",
    "the procedure is to average the leading term in @xmath105 over an interval in @xmath32 centered at the point of interest of radius , say , @xmath134 for some @xmath135 , and then pass to the limit @xmath12 .",
    "this produces the desired local average over rapid oscillations of wavelength or period proportional to @xmath7 . under an ergodic hypothesis that is valid on a set of full measure in the @xmath31-plane ,",
    "this procedure is equivalent to holding @xmath136 and @xmath137 fixed and averaging ( with uniform measure ) over the torus of relative angles @xmath138 and @xmath139 . the double integrals can be evaluated explicitly , with the result that @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 , are nonnegative coefficients with the property that @xmath143 .",

    "thus the weak limit produces in this case exactly the branch @xmath148 through multiphase averaging or a permutation thereof , defining this situation is an open condition on @xmath149 , and therefore ( depending on initial conditions ) there can exist open domains in the @xmath31-plane on which the weak limit of @xmath105 is given by a single branch of the solution of the inviscid burgers equation while @xmath105 itself exhibits wild oscillations .",
    "interestingly , this is precisely the conjecture made by von neumann regarding grid - scale oscillations observed in the numerical solution of burgers equation via a finite - difference scheme ( which may be viewed as a dispersive regularization of the equation ) . while many model equations for finite - difference schemes ( the kdv equation is one example ) do not yield such a simple interpretation of the weak limit @xcite",
