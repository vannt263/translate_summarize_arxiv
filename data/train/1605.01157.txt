    "one of the most serious problems in the standard model ( sm ) is the so - called gauge hierarchy problem , which has been motivating us to seek new physics beyond the sm for decades .",
    "the problem originates from the fact that quantum corrections to the self - energy of the sm higgs doublet field quadratically diverge , and this divergence , once cut off by a physical new physics scale being much higher than the electroweak scale , must be canceled by a fine - tuning of the higgs mass parameter at the tree level . because of the chiral nature of the sm",
    ", the sm lagrangian possesses the conformal ( scale ) invariance at the classical level , except for the higgs mass term .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that once the classically conformal invariance and its minimal violation by quantum anomalies are imposed on the sm , it could be free from the quadratic divergences ; hence , the classically conformal invariance might provide us with a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "this picture nicely fits a setup first investigated by coleman and weinberg  @xcite , namely , a u(1 ) gauge theory with a massless higgs field . in this setup",
    ", it has been shown that the u(1 ) gauge symmetry is radiatively broken in the coleman - weinberg effective potential ( coleman - weinberg mechanism ) .",
    "although it is tempting to apply this coleman - weinberg mechanism to the sm higgs sector , this can not work with the observed values of top quark and weak boson masses , since the coleman - weinberg potential for the sm higgs field is found to be unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to pursue this scheme , it is necessary to extend the sm .",
    "there have been a lot of new physics model proposals ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the classically conformal u(1)@xmath0 extension of the sm proposed in @xcite , where in addition to the sm particle content , three generations of right - handed neutrinos and a u(1)@xmath0 higgs field are introduced . by assigning generation - independent u(1)@xmath0 charges for fermions , making the model free from all gauge and gravitational anomalies , and reproducing the yukawa structure in the sm ,",
    "it turns out that the u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry is identified as a linear combination of the sm u(1)@xmath13 and the u(1)@xmath14 gauge groups  @xcite .",
    "hence , our model is a generalization on the classically conformal u(1)@xmath14 extension of the sm proposed in @xcite .",
    "the u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry is radiatively broken by the coleman - weinberg mechanism , and the u(1)@xmath0 gauge field ( @xmath1 boson ) and the right - handed ( majorana ) neutrinos acquire their masses .",
    "a mixing quartic coupling between the u(1)@xmath0 higgs and the sm higgs doublet fields generates a negative mass squared for the sm higgs doublet field , and the electroweak symmetry breaking is driven .",
    "therefore , the radiative u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry is the sole origin of the mass scale in this model . with the majorana heavy neutrinos , the seesaw mechanism @xcite is automatically implemented , and tiny active neutrino masses and their flavor mixing are generated after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the sm higgs boson has been discovered at the lhc , and this marks the beginning of the experimental confirmation of the sm higgs sector .",
    "the observed higgs boson mass of @xmath15 gev from a combined analysis by the atlas and the cms @xcite indicates that the electroweak vacuum is unstable @xcite since the sm higgs quartic coupling becomes negative far below the planck mass , for the top quark pole mass @xmath16 from the combined measurements by the tevatron and the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "practically , this instability may not be a problem in the sm , since the lifetime of our electroweak vacuum is estimated to be much longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of the u(1)@xmath0 higgs field , our higgs potential is a function of two higgs fields , and there might be a flat path around high mountains of the potential toward the true vacuum and make the lifetime of our electroweak vacuum very short .",
    "because of a lack of field theoretical technology for analyzing the effective scalar potential with multiscalars in a wide range of field values , it would be the best way to solve the electroweak vacuum instability problem in the context of our model .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the electroweak vacuum stability in the classically conformal u(1)@xmath0 extended sm . in the same model context , the electroweak vacuum stability problem and the current experimental bounds on the model have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to improve the analysis in @xcite for the electroweak vacuum stability by the renormalization group equations ( rges ) at the two - loop level , and present a complete result for the parameter scan .",
    "we also update the constraints on the model parameters by taking into account the recent lhc run-2 results for the search for @xmath1 boson resonances @xcite .",
    "we find that the lhc run-2 results dramatically improve those obtained from the run-1 results .",
    "in addition , we calculate the sm higgs self - energy corrections from the effective potential involving the heavy states , the right - handed neutrinos and the @xmath1 boson , after the u(1)@xmath0 symmetry breaking , and derive the naturalness bounds to reproduce the right electroweak scale for a fine - tuning level better than 10% .",

    "<S> we consider the minimal u(1)@xmath0 extension of the standard model ( sm ) with the classically conformal invariance , where an anomaly - free u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry is introduced along with three generations of right - handed neutrinos and a u(1)@xmath0 higgs field . since the classically conformal symmetry forbids all dimensional parameters in the model , the u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken by the coleman - weinberg mechanism , generating the mass terms of the u(1)@xmath0 gauge boson ( @xmath1 boson ) and the right - handed neutrinos . through a mixing quartic coupling between the u(1)@xmath0 higgs field and the sm higgs doublet field </S>",
    "<S> , the radiative u(1)@xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak symmetry . in this model context , we first investigate the electroweak vacuum instability problem in the sm . employing the renormalization group equations at the two - loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the top quark ( @xmath2 gev ) and the higgs boson ( @xmath3 gev ) , we perform parameter scans to identify the parameter region for resolving the electroweak vacuum instability problem . </S>",
    "<S> next we interpret the recent atlas and cms search limits at the lhc run-2 for the sequential @xmath1 boson to constrain the parameter region in our model . </S>",
    "<S> combining the constraints from the electroweak vacuum stability and the lhc run-2 results , we find a bound on the @xmath1 boson mass as @xmath4 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate self - energy corrections to the sm higgs doublet field through the heavy states , the right - handed neutrinos and the @xmath1 boson , and find the naturalness bound as @xmath5 tev , in order to reproduce the right electroweak scale for the fine - tuning level better than 10% . </S>",
