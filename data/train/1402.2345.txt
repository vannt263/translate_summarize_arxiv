    "coupled electron - nuclear spin systems are important platform for quantum information processing@xcite .",
    "single electron spins are promising quantum processors because of their addressability and controllability@xcite .",
    "nuclear spins are regarded as ideal quantum memories since they are less sensitive to the environmental noise and have longer coherence time@xcite .",
    "coupled electron - nuclear spin systems have the advantages of both ingredients .",
    "however , in many solid state systems , a large number of nuclear spins around the electron spin usually form a spin bath , serving as a decoherence source of electron spins , rather than a kind of resource .",
    "individual nuclear spins have to be resolved , otherwise they can hardly be used as quantum memories . in this sense , identifying single nuclear spins in a spin bath is highly desirable .",
    "single nuclear spins can be resolved through the splitting of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectrum due to coupling to the nuclear spins .",
    "the resolution of the esr spectrum splitting is limited by the transition linewidth .",
    "usually , only the nuclear spins strongly coupled to the electron spin ( with the coupling strengths much larger than the linewidth ) can be well resolved@xcite .",
    "resolving the weakly coupled nuclear spins ( with coupling strengths comparable to the linewidth ) is a challenging task .",
    "this greatly limits the potential of using these nuclear spins as resources .    the limitation on resolution by esr linewidth",
    "can be overcome by actively controlling the electron spins via , for example , continuously driving spectroscopy@xcite and dynamical decoupling ( dd ) control@xcite .",
    "in particular , dd control of electron spins was proposed to be a powerful tool to detect small nuclear spin clusters@xcite . under dd control , single nuclear spin clusters around center electron spins manifest themselves as characteristic fingerprint oscillations on the electron spin coherence . with this discovery , nuclear magnetic resonance",
    "can be realized at the single - molecule level@xcite .",
    "very recently , applying the standard carre - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) dd sequence on the electron spins of nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers , people have successfully demonstrated the identification of weakly coupled individual nuclear spins@xcite , and the resolving of the structure of single nuclear spins cluster@xcite .",
    "in addition to the widely used periodic cpmg control sequence , various different types of dd control sequence were designed for different purposes@xcite .",
    "for example , the uhrig s dd ( udd ) sequence with nonuniformly - spaced pulses were proposed@xcite and experimentally@xcite shown to be the optimal sequence to protect the short - time center spin coherence .",
    "also , various concatenated or nested schemes based on cpmg and udd are developed for different purposes@xcite , such as protecting spin coherence of multi - qubits@xcite . in this paper , aiming at identifying single nuclear spins and improving the resolution of nuclear spin noise spectroscopy , we generalize the standard cpmg sequence and design a new control pulse sequence . with the designed sequence ,",
    "more nuclear spins in the spin bath can be resolved in comparison to the standard cpmg sequence .    in order to demonstrate the application of our designed dd sequence , we focus on the identification of single nuclear spins around nv center electron spins in diamond , which is a promising solid - state system in quantum information processing and nano - scale magnetometry@xcite .",
    "we show that solely increasing the cpmg control pulse number does not help resolve more nuclear spins . instead ,",
    "in order to achieve high resolution , in the designed pulse sequence , we replace the cpmg repetition unit ( a single @xmath0-pulse ) by a group of @xmath0-pulses .",
    "the pulse timing structure within each repetition unit provides additional degrees of freedom to tailor the corresponding noise filter function in the frequency domain .",
    "thus , according to the features of the detected spin noise , the filter function can be fine - tuned to resolve more nuclear spins .",
    "the principle of the dd sequence design can be used in the general noise spectroscopy in other systems such as trapped ions@xcite and superconducting qubits@xcite .",

    "section [ sectii ] describes the nv center spin coherence under dd control sequence and analyzes the semi - classical nuclear spin noise spectrum .",
    "section [ sectiv ] demonstrates the improved resolution of the designed dd sequence .",

    "we consider the nv center system as an example to demonstrate the principle of dd design for high - resolution spin noise spectroscopy and nuclear spin identification .",

    "the first collapse time increases linearly as increasing the pulse number @xmath33@xcite .",

    "the underlying physics of the coherent oscillations can be understood in semi - classical picture with nuclear spin noise spectrum @xmath35 . to calculate the noise spectrum ,",
    "we define the averaged bath hamiltonian @xmath36 and the noise operator @xmath37 of the @xmath14th @xmath1c bath spin .",
    "the two eigen - frequencies and the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath38 are denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig2_spectrum](a ) shows the calculated nuclear spin noise spectrum of the same spin bath as that used in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig1_cpmg ] ) . the noise frequency is determined by both of the _ intrinsic _ lammor frequency of @xmath1c nuclear spins in the given magnetic field @xmath7 , and the _ back - action _ arising from the hyperfine coupling of each nuclear spins to the center electron spin@xcite .",
    "particularly , for the center electron spin being prepared in the superposition state of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the @xmath14th @xmath1c nuclear spin contributes noise with frequency @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath1c nuclear spins far from the nv center electron spin have hyperfine coupling strengths much smaller than the applied magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "they produce nuclear spin noise with approximately the same frequencies , and form a quasi - continuous noise band around the larmor frequency ( see the grey shadow region in fig  [ fig : fig2_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the few @xmath1c nuclear spins close to the nv center ( with distance of several @xmath49 ) have hyperfine coupling strengths ( in the order of @xmath50  khz ) comparable or larger than the applied magnetic field strength ( but not strong enough to cause esr spectrum splitting ) .",
    "thus , they produce nuclear spin noise with frequencies significantly different from the larmor frequency , and form discrete spectral lines .",
    "these nuclear spins can be resolved by measuring the nv center electron spin coherence under dd control .    in the semi - classical picture ,",

    "figure  [ fig : fig2_spectrum](b ) shows the filter function of the 50-pulse cpmg control .",
    "the periodic applied pulses in the time domain give rise to sharp peaks at frequencies @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) . as increasing the total evolution time @xmath55",
    ", the filter function peaks sweep from the high frequency side .",
    "whenever the filter function peaks overlap with a discrete peak in the noise spectrum , there appears a coherence dip according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussiancoherence ] ) . when the first peak of the filter function touches the quasi - continuous noise band , the electron spin coherence collapses .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : fig1_cpmg ] seem to imply that increasing the coherence time by dd control would benefit the single nuclear spin identification . to check this , we compare the decoherence behavior under 50-pulse cpmg control with that under 150-pulse control , which has 3 times longer coherence time than the former ( see fig .

    "fig : fig3_packpulse ] ) .",
    "however , the nulcear spin resolution is not improved .",
    "the same three nuclear spins as in the 50-pulse case are resolved from the coherence oscillation features .",
    "indeed , the unnecessarily strong peak in the filter function @xmath52 prevents the further improvement of the resolution .",
    "here , we should emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussiancoherence ] ) is obtained by keeping the noise correlation only to the second order and , essentially , is a perturbation treatment valid only in the weak noise case .",
    "when the filter function peak is too strong ( i.e. , the filtered noise @xmath56 , like in the 150-pulse cpmg case ) , the electron spin coherence will obviously deviate from eq .",
    "[ eq : gaussiancoherence ] .",
    "the central dip is deformed and the side dips become strong . in this case , a single nuclear spin produces a broadened and highly oscillating structure in the electron spin coherence .",
    "the interference of oscillating structures blurs the fingerprint features of individual nuclear spins to be resolved .    to solve this problem , we design pulse sequences simultaneously with high frequency selectivity and moderate peak strength of the filter function . to this end",

    "the filter function is expressed as @xmath66 for the standard cpmg sequence ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "tuning the relative positions @xmath69 within the repetition unit modifies the strength of the filter function peaks . taking the symmetric 3-pulse repetition unit for example , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 as a special example",
    ", the 150-pulse cpmg sequence can be regarded as 50 repetitions of a 3-pulse unit with @xmath73 . in this case , the pulses are indeed equally spaced , and one can check that the zero points of @xmath74 with @xmath75 precisely cancel the extra peaks of @xmath76 leaving only those peaks fulfil the peak condition of @xmath77 [ i.e. , @xmath78 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_packpulse](b ) ] .",
    "slightly shifting the positions @xmath69 from the cpmg values ( e.g. , @xmath75 in the @xmath79 example above ) , we obtain a modified pulse sequence with both high frequency selectivity and moderate height of the filter function [ see figs .  [",

    "[ fig : fig2_spectrum](a ) and [ fig : fig3_packpulse](e ) ] , nuclear spins d and e can not be resolved by the strong filter function peaks of the standard cpmg sequence . while the much weaker and narrower filter function peak of the designed pulse sequence is able to resolve much finer structure close to the noise band edge .",
