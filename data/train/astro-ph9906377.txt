    "so far , warm absorbers revealed their existence mainly in the soft x - ray spectral region by imprinting absorption edges on the x - ray spectra of many agn .",
    "this highly ionized material provides an important new diagnostic tool to investigate the physical conditions in the nuclei of active galaxies .",
    "recently , evidence has accumulated that some warm absorbers contain significant amounts of dust .",
    "this possibility was first suggested by brandt et al .",
    "( 1996 , b96 hereafter ) to explain the lack of excess x - ray _ cold _ absorption despite strong optical reddening of the quasar iras 13349 + 2438 . a point emphasized by komossa & fink ( kofi hereafter , e.g. 1997a , b ) and komossa & bade ( koba ; 1998 ) is the strong influence of the presence of dust on the x - ray absorption spectrum which becomes drastic for high column densities @xmath0 .",
    "signatures of the presence of ( galactic - ism - like ) dust , as opposed to the dust - free case are , e.g. ,    * a strong carbon edge in the x - ray spectrum , * a stronger temperature gradient across the absorber with more gas in a ` colder ' state , shifting the dominant absorption edges to more lowly ionized species * increased sensitivity of dusty gas to radiation pressure , which may drive strong outflows of the warm material .",
    "the first two effects lead to an _ effective flattening _ of the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "thus , for both , the derivation of the physical properties of the warm absorber as well as the intrinsic spectral shape it is important to apply self - consistent models that take into account the presence of dust .",
    ".properties of the dusty warm absorber in iras 13349 derived from x - ray spectral fits . for comparison results for a dust - free warm absorber",
    "are shown .",
    "the derived properties of the ionized material and the intrinsic continuum are rather different in this case .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]     @xmath1 fixed to the value @xmath2 determined from optical reddening    this quasar received a lot of attention , recently . a detailed optical study was presented by wills et al . (",
    "1992 ) . in a thorough study of the x - ray spectrum of",
    ", b96 suggested the presence of a dusty warm absorber .",
    "brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected changes in the spectrum as compared to the earlier data ; the warm - absorption features remained present ( brandt et al .",
    "further candidates for dusty warm absorbers quickly followed , including ngc3227 ( kofi 1996 , 1997b ) , ngc3786 ( kofi 1997c ) , and iras17020 + 4544 ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 , koba ) .",
    "whereas the model of a warm absorber that _ includes _ the presence of dust has been successfully fit to these objects , it has not yet been applied to  ( first results of the present study were reported by komossa 1998 , and komossa & greiner 1999 ) .",
    "given the potentially strong modifications of the x - ray absorption spectrum in the presence of dust , it is important to scrutinize whether a dusty warm absorber is consistent with the observed x - ray spectrum . since some strong features of dusty warm absorbers appear outside the sensitivity range , data are best suited for this purpose ; we used the two pointed pspc observations of  of jan .",
    "1992 and dec .",
    "1992 .    as ionizing continuum illuminating the absorber we adopted a mean seyfert spectrum of piecewise powerlaws ( as in kofi 1997b ) with @xmath3 .",
    "we use as definition for the ionization parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rate of photons above the lyman limit .",
    "the photoionization calculations were carried out with ferland s ( 1993 ) code _",
    "cloudy_.    in a first step , we fit a dust-_free _ warm absorber ( as in b96 , but using the additional information on the hard x - ray powerlaw available from the asca observation , @xmath6 ) .",
    "this gives an excellent fit with log @xmath0=22.7 ( @xmath7 = 0.8 ) .",
    "if this same model is re - calculated by fixing @xmath0 and the other best - fit parameters but _ adding dust _ to the warm absorber the x - ray spectral shape is drastically altered and the data can not be fit at all ( @xmath7 = 150 ) .",
    "this still holds if we allow for non - standard dust , i.e. , selectively exclude either the graphite or silicate species .    whereas this first approach was mainly to demonstrate the strong influence of the presence of dust",
    ", it has to be kept in mind that the expected column density @xmath2 derived from optical extinction is less than the x - ray value of @xmath0 determined under the above assumptions .",
    "therefore , in a next step , we allowed all parameters ( except ) to be free and checked , whether a dusty warm absorber could be successfully fit at all .",
    "this is not the case ( e.g. , if @xmath0 is fixed to log @xmath2 = 21.2 we get @xmath7 = 40 ) .",
    "the bad fit results can be partially traced back to the ` flattening ' effect of dust .",
    "in fact , if we allow for a steeper intrinsic powerlaw spectrum , with @xmath8 much steeper than the value , a dusty warm absorber with @xmath9 fits the spectrum well ( @xmath7 = 1.2 , tab .",
    "we also analyzed the all - sky survey data of this source and , again , a steep intrinsic spectrum is required .    at present , there are several possible explanations for the _ rosat_-spectral differences : ( i ) variability in the intrinsic powerlaw .",
    "we consider this solution unlikely , since the spectrum is steep in all three observations taken at different times .",
    "( ii ) remaining _ rosat_-cross - calibration uncertainties .",
    "this is well possible , given previous reports of a tendency of _ steeper _ spectra when compared with data of the same object .",
    "( iii ) variability in a _",
    "two_-component warm absorber .",
    "there are increasing indications of more than one x - ray warm absorber in mcg6 - 30 - 15 , and  might be a similar case .    in summary ,",
    "the presence of a _ dusty _ warm absorber in iras13349 + 2438 seems consistent with the data if one allows for some spectral differences between the and data .",
    "the necessity of dust survival then locates the ionized material _",
    "outside _ the bulk of the broad line region ( blr ) of .",
    "clear signatures of the presence of dust are the carbon edge at 0.28 kev and the oxygen edge at 0.56 kev ( not yet individually resolved by current x - ray instruments ) , and the confirmation and study of dusty warm absorbers will certainly be a prime goal of future x - ray satellites like _",
    "axaf _ and _ xmm_. in particular , _ dust_-created absorption edges will play an important role not only in probing components of the active nucleus , like the dusty torus , but also are they a very useful diagnostic of the dust properties in other galaxies .",
    "further , measurements of edge energies and widths will allow to determine the dynamical state of the warm absorber .",
