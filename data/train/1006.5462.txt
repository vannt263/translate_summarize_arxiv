    "lasers emit light over a range of wavelengths described by the laser line shape function.@xcite for a hene laser operating under normal conditions , the main source of laser line shape broadening is doppler broadening in the lasing medium , resulting in a gaussian gain profile ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : long_modes2 ] ) .",
    "the laser does not emit a continuous spectrum of wavelengths over this gaussian gain - permitted wavelength range ; rather , it can only lase when there is resonance in the lasing cavity . for the tem@xmath0 mode there exists an integer number , @xmath2 , of half wavelengths between the mirrors of the laser cavity , resulting in the allowed resonance wavelengths @xmath3 where @xmath4 is",
    "the length of the laser cavity and @xmath5 is the index of refraction of the medium filling the laser cavity .",
    "the laser output consists of discrete wavelength peaks with power dictated by the gaussian line shape envelope and the unsaturated gain threshold ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : long_modes2 ] ) .",
    "these peaks are called longitudinal cavity modes . when the laser cavity supports more than one peak ( that is , where the gain is greater than the losses for those peaks )",
    ", the laser output consists of multiple discrete wavelengths .",
    "if the light from these multiple modes is projected onto a detector ( for example , a photodiode ) , then the photocurrent will oscillate at the difference frequency , producing a beat signal .",
    "the beat frequency of interest is at the frequency due to the spacing between adjacent longitudinal modes .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath2th mode can be derived from eq .",
    "( 1 ) to be @xmath6 .",
    "thus the beat frequency is given by @xmath7 and therefore @xmath8 , indicating that the cavity length is directly proportional to the reciprocal of the beat frequency.@xcite observing the variation in beat frequency between adjacent longitudinal modes with the cavity length @xmath4 gives the speed of light .",
    "accurate measurements of the beat frequency are accomplished inexpensively by directing the output of the laser onto a high - speed photodetector@xcite monitored with an rf spectrum analyzer or frequency counter.@xcite this approach has been demonstrated in ref .   in an undergraduate experiment with the goal of measuring the speed of light using the relation in eq .",
    "( 2 ) for a single laser cavity length and single corresponding beat frequency .",
    "the method is easily understood because it is analogous to investigations of waves on a string .",
    "it has a drawback , however ; the inability to obtain a precise measurement of the cavity length ( from the inner - cavity side of the output coupler to inner - cavity side of the back mirror ) inevitably leads to results that are only marginally better than those obtained with standard time - of - flight or foucault methods commonly used in undergraduate physics laboratories , which typically yield measurements accurate to within @xmath9.@xcite minor improvements on this method can be made by collecting data for multiple lasers of different lengths and plotting the beat frequency as a function of cavity length .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty in length between the mirrors , there is also the problem of not knowing a precise ( and constant ) value for the index of refraction inside the gas tube .",
    "these obstacles can be overcome by using the laser as a simple light source , amplitude modulated at the intermode beat frequency , and measuring the phase difference between detectors placed at two different locations along the laser path.@xcite this modulation technique improves the measurement of the speed of light by an order of magnitude , but at the cost of increasing the conceptual complexity .",
    "the introduction of the adjustable - length hene laser significantly reduces the consequences of uncertainty in mirror location and the index of refraction , and improves the measurement by a order of magnitude over the modulation technique , while retaining the conceptual simplicity of the original study of ref .  .",
    "figure  [ fig : hene_set - up ] represents a schematic of the experimental set - up .",
    "the laser has an adjustable , open - cavity design with a 28 cm hene plasma tube terminated on one side with a mirror and on the other with a brewster window .",
    "the brewster window suppresses modes with polarization orthogonal to the brewster plane , so that all supported modes have the same polarization and thus mix effectively in the photodetector.@xcite the experiment can be conducted without a brewster window , but due to mode competition , adjacent longitudinal modes are typically polarized orthogonal to each other and do not mix in the photodetector , resulting in an observed signal with twice the expected frequency.@xcite if a brewster window is not present , the situation can be remedied by placing a linear polarizer in front of the photodetector to project the polarizations of adjacent modes onto a common axis .        the variable - length cavity system has been reported and widely used in undergraduate labs to explore laser cavity modes and stability.@xcite the output coupler is a 0.60 m radius - of - curvature mirror held in a gimbal mount .",
    "it is attached to a sliding track , allowing the cavity length to be changed from @xmath10 cm ( lower bound limited by the length of the plasma tube ) up to @xmath11 cm ( upper bound restricted by laser losses ) .",
    "typically we see two or three longitudinal modes separated by about 300mhz within the 1.5ghz gain bandwidth of the hene medium.@xcite inside the cavity , between the output coupler and the plasma tube , is an iris used to restrict gain in the region away from the optical axis of the cavity and thus force the laser to emit in the tem@xmath0 ( gaussian ) mode .",
    "restricting the laser to a single transverse mode is necessary because higher - order modes produce additional beat frequencies that complicate the rf spectrum .",
    "the allowed frequencies for the tem@xmath0 mode are given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the allowed frequencies for higher - order tem@xmath12 modes are given by @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the same mode number as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and @xmath14 is the resonator stability.@xcite thus if tem@xmath0 and tem@xmath12 are allowed to exist simultaneously in the cavity , beat frequencies will exist at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these additional beat frequencies could provide an interesting method for measuring the resonator stability , @xmath14 , for a fixed cavity length .      as noted in sec .",
    "i , we can not accurately measure the entire laser cavity length due to the uncertainty of the position of the mirror in the hene tube .",
    "in addition , the index of refraction within the he- and ne - filled tube is different from that in the rest of the cavity , which is filled with air ( and a small length of glass at the window ) . because we do not know the index of refraction inside the laser plasma tube , we modify eq .",
    "( 2 ) by splitting @xmath4 into the two main regions within the laser cavity that have different indices of refraction . let @xmath17 be the index of refraction inside the laser plasma tube and @xmath18 be the index of refraction of air between the brewster window and the output coupler .",
    "then , @xmath19 , where additional fixed components such as the glass window and dielectric mirror coatings are assumed in the first term . in practice neither of these @xmath4 values is simple to measure accurately , and thus we split @xmath20 further into two arbitrary pieces ( a fixed length and a measured variable length ) such that @xmath21 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hene_set - up ] ) .",
    "we substitute this expression into eq .",
    "( 2 ) and obtain @xmath22 which is the equation of a line with slope @xmath23 .",
    "equation ( 4 ) allows us to measure the cavity length to an arbitrarily chosen reference point fixed between the laser plasma tube output and the output coupler . in practice",
    "we measure @xmath24 from a fixed block near the sliding track to the base of the output coupler using digital vernier calipers .",
    "the speed of light is then found from the slope of a @xmath24 versus @xmath25 plot .",
    "the unknown details of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and similar terms for the glass window are gathered in the @xmath28-intercept .",
    "this algebraic trick works only when the laser is in the tem@xmath0 mode , and does not work if the laser were in transverse tem@xmath29 modes ( where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are nonzero ) , as represented in eq .",
    "more elegantly , we are taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the region of air where we are free to move the output coupler as shown : @xmath32      for the range of laser cavity lengths in the set - up ( @xmath33 m to 0.38 m ) , the beat frequency varies from @xmath34mhz to 390mhz , a change of 110mhz over 16 cm .",
    "the signal from the photodetector was analyzed with an rf spectrum analyzer with a maximum span of 3ghz and a minimum resolution bandwidth of @xmath35hz.@xcite a frequency counter could in principle be used , but would not provide insight into additional beat frequencies from transverse mode contributions .",
    "in addition to analyzing the laser output with the photodetector and spectrum analyzer , we split off a portion of the laser output to a scanning fabry - perot interferometer to observe its longitudinal mode structure.@xcite the fabry - perot spectrum shows the number of modes and their amplitudes ( and therefore the amplitude of the gain curve ) .",
    "the amplitude of the modes provides information on frequency pulling and pushing , which cause small but statistically significant shifts in the beat frequency .",
    "_ frequency pulling _ refers to a change in the spacing of longitudinal modes under a gain curve resulting from the different indices of refraction experienced by each mode . across the range of frequencies that lie within the laser gain curve ,",
    "the index of refraction varies steeply near the resonance transition , being lower or higher for frequencies below or above the resonance transition . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) we see that the allowed frequencies below the gain peak occur at higher frequencies than would be expected and vice versa .",
    "the result is a  pulling \" of the longitudinal modes toward the center of the gain curve , effectively decreasing the difference frequency between the two .",
    "the amount by which the modes are pulled together and the beat frequency is lowered is a function of the relative intensity of the two heterodyning modes . for a given gain curve amplitude we find that the beat frequency varies over @xmath36 to 40khz for the full range of mode relative intensities , in agreement with other studies.@xcite    _ frequency pushing _ refers to the increase of the difference frequency between longitudinal modes as the field intensity in the laser cavity increases.@xcite as the gain in the cavity is increased , the beat frequency also increases .",
    "we observe this increase in our set - up ; when two adjacent longitudinal modes are observed with identical intensities , for a @xmath37% change in total amplitude of the gain curve , there is a @xmath38khz change in beat frequency .",
    "figure  [ fig : pushing ] shows this effect over a wide range of amplitudes , showing a linear relation between the change in the intensity of the modes and the frequency pushing effect .",
    "when taking data to measure the speed of light , we are able to hold our amplitude fluctuation to a variation of @xmath39% .    to minimize inconsistencies due to frequency pulling effects , we use the fabry - perot to ensure that each measurement ( that is , the beat frequency at each cavity length ) is taken for two longitudinal modes at the same relative intensities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lmodes_neq ] ) .",
    "the refractive index within the laser tube is then the same for both modes and very similar for all beat frequency measurements , reducing the pulling effect .",
    "more complex methods of ensuring that the two longitudinal modes are symmetric about the frequency of the emission line have been implemented in other studies.@xcite these involve using a non - brewster window laser and subtracting the outputs of the orthogonal modes detected with two photodetectors and a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "this difference is used to control the electronic feedback to make slight adjustments to the length of the cavity .",
    "we have not attempted such elaborate feedback schemes .",
    "instead , students make the necessary adjustments by applying gentle pressure to the optical table , which affects the cavity length on the micron scale",
    ".     corresponds to a 18khz frequency variation equivalent to a @xmath40khz uncertainty in the beat frequency .",
    "the @xmath41 mark in this figure refers to the desired amplitude at which the frequency measurement is to be taken.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to counteract inconsistencies due to frequency pushing effects , we use the fabry - perot to ensure that each measurement is taken with the longitudinal modes at the same total amplitude and thus at the same laser intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lmodes_eq ] ) .",
    "the laser power is controlled by changing the cavity loss by adjusting the intra - cavity iris .",
    "figure  [ fig : hene_data_plot ] represents experimental data for 28 cavity lengths .",
    "the uncertainty in our @xmath24 measurement is @xmath42 m , dictated by the measurement limit of the digital vernier calipers .",
    "the uncertainty in our beat frequencies is dominated by frequency variability due to frequency pulling and pushing and has been minimized with the use of the fabry - perot interferometer . due to frequency pulling and pushing , a change in the relative or total intensities of the heterodyning longitudinal modes corresponds to a change in the beat frequency . thus the uncertainty in the beat frequency is found by estimating the precision to which we can achieve both the desired mode relative intensity and desired gain curve amplitude . using the fabry - perot interferometer",
    ", we find that we can steadily hold the two longitudinal modes at equal relative intensities , resulting in a negligible uncertainty of @xmath43khz due to frequency pulling .",
    "most of the uncertainty comes from frequency pushing , for it is not as simple to hold the total amplitude of the gain curve at a fixed value . to estimate this uncertainty ,",
    "the precision to which the amplitudes of the modes can be held constant is converted into an uncertainty in frequency from the spread of beat frequencies observed simultaneously on the spectrum analyzer .",
    "we observe that by adjusting the position and aperture size of the iris in the resonator , we can manipulate the output to have two longitudinal modes with equal intensity and an overall gain amplitude that is constant to within @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pushing ] shows the beat frequency as a function of the total mode amplitude for our system .",
    "a @xmath44 variation in the total mode amplitude corresponds to an uncertainty in a single measurement of the beat frequency of @xmath45khz .",
    "the uncertainty in the frequency measurement , @xmath46 , and the uncertainty in the length measurement , @xmath47 , are fixed for each data point , but the uncertainty in the reciprocal beat frequency , @xmath48 , is a function of @xmath49 ( which varies for each data point ) . hence the uncertainty in @xmath50 is not fixed for each data point : @xmath51 . additionally the equivalent uncertainty in @xmath24 due to the uncertainty in @xmath49 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath47 .",
    "that is , @xmath52 for this reason , a weighted least squares regression incorporating uncertainty in both variables is performed for the @xmath24 versus @xmath25 data.@xcite    the final result for the speed of light in air based on the data plotted in fig .",
    "6 is @xmath53 the uncertainty of @xmath54 is small enough to discriminate between the speed of light in air ( @xmath55 m/s for @xmath56 ) and the speed of light in a vacuum ( @xmath57 m/s ) .",
    "m / s.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the measured speed of light yields an index of refraction for air in our lab of @xmath58 .",
    "we compare this value to the index of refraction of air as a function of temperature , wavelength , pressure , and humidity . at conditions of @xmath59c ,",
    "632.8 nm , 1 atm , and 40% relative humidity , the accepted index of refraction of air is 1.00027.@xcite no realistic changes in relative humidity , room temperature , or atmospheric pressure significantly affect the result .",
    "therefore , the method described here does not have the necessary precision to demonstrate the effects of atmospheric fluctuations on the index of refraction .",
    "this experiment exposes students to a variety of experimental and mathematical techniques , demonstrates the importance of uncertainty in measurement , provides a meaningful context for using weighted regression , and familiarizes the student with three ubiquitous instruments : the laser , the fabry - perot interferometer , and the rf spectrum analyzer .",
    "in addition the experiment yields satisfying results , allowing measurement of the speed of light to a precision which differentiates between the speed of light in air and the speed of light in a vacuum . the precision to which the measurement is taken is limited by both the precision of our length measurement and our ability to minimize uncertainties due to the frequency pushing and pulling .",
    "one could improve length measurements with a precision linear stage and one could lock the hene laser so that the longitudinal modes are held to the same amplitude , but both of these improvements would be beyond the necessary scope of an intermediate physics laboratory course .    the authors would like to thank all of the juniata college students who have performed this measurement in the advanced physics lab over the past five years .",
