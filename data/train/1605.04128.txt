    "<S> based on a special structure of the lattice binary image , a second full - diversity lattice construction is described for sparse integer - check matrices in the context of iterative probabilistic decoding . full diversity is theoretically proved in both cases . we also propose a method to construct lattices for diversity order @xmath0 suitable for iterative probabilistic decoding . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulation results for diversity order @xmath1 and @xmath2 confirm that the proposed low - density lattices attain the maximal diversity order . </S>",
    "<S> the newly defined pol is used during this simulation to declare an outage error without decoding , which drastically improves the decoding runtime .    </S>",
