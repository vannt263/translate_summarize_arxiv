    "particle - substrate adhesion is ubiquitous in biological systems . in the case of cell - surface adhesion ,",
    "bonding between surface receptors expressed on the cell and complementary ligands expressed on any membrane or cell surface , allow the cell and the surface to specifically adhere to each other like a lock and a key , causing cell adhesion to be highly specific .",
    "some examples are : binding of white blood cells ( leukocytes ) to particular tissues by specific receptor interactions with surface ligands @xcite ; enhanced adhesion of infected red blood cells to artery and capillary walls due to surface receptors expressed by the malarial parasite , _ plasmodium falciparum _",
    "@xcite ; modulation of adhesive properties of cancer cells leading to metastases from the primary tumor through the circulatory system  @xcite ; viral docking to cell surface receptors  @xcite _ etc .",
    "_ _ in vitro _",
    "experimental techniques such as surface force apparatus , dynamic force spectroscopy , flow chamber experiments and optical trap force spectroscopy have been used extensively to probe various steps in microparticle adhesion .",
    "modeling and computer simulations further allow one to explore adhesion of particles coated with receptors moving near a ligand - coated substrate under the action of external forces  @xcite .",
    "such simulations are now being increasingly used to extract parameters such as rate constants in binding kinetics , binding energies and force constants _ etc .",
    "_ by fitting model predictions through experimental data  @xcite .",
    "currently , such studies use the extracted parameters for qualitatively comparing the behaviour of particles with different binding properties _",
    "e.g. _ healthy and malaria - infected red - blood cells have different adhesins expressed on their surface .",
    "the wide interest in drug delivery however suggests that quantitative accuracy may also be desirable for designing particles with specific adhesion targets .",
    "there are significant differences however between simulation approaches used in studies so far , particularly in relation to the treatment of thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) with the rigid ligand - coated substrate ( the  wall \" ) .",
    "our aim is to better understand the role played by these phenomena in determining the states of motion and the dynamics of an adhesive microparticle in a shear flow cell , so that a more judicious choice of simplifying assumptions and simulation approaches can be made depending on one s end goals .",
    "the pclet number @xmath0 estimates the relative importance of the kinematics enforced by the imposed flow over the brownian motion caused by thermal fluctuations .",
    "typical shear rates at which shear - cell studies are carried out are around 1 - 100 s@xmath1 .",
    "such shear gradients correspond to very large @xmath0 values for microparticles such as cells of size 1100 @xmath2 m in an aqueous medium .",
    "typically a high value of @xmath3 is assumed to indicate that thermal fluctuations are unimportant , and early simulations of particle adhesion  @xcite ignored thermal fluctuations completely for this reason .",
    "they demonstrated that the coupling of the shear flow with the on- and off - kinetics of the receptor - ligand interactions led to various states of motion of an adhesive particle at a wall , such as rolling , firm - adhesion , free diffusion , _",
    "etc_. @xcite studied these states of motion at high @xmath0 values by including brownian fluctuations .",
    "they argued that although thermal fluctuations under such conditions are unimportant for the motion of the particle in the plane of the shear flow , they affect the orientational diffusion of the particle about the gradient direction , bringing receptors into proximity with ligands .",
    "this raises two questions : firstly , what if any are the changes to the states of motion when thermal fluctuations are included in high-@xmath0 simulations , and secondly , under what conditions are fluctuations unimportant and hence may be safely neglected in order to design less computationally - intensive simulations ( i.e. , relatively fast deterministic algorithms ) .",
    "the adhesion models in the studies cited above incorporate hydrodynamic interactions of the spherical particle with the wall  @xcite . on the other hand , the brownian adhesive dynamics",
    "( brad ) algorithm of  @xcite ignores hi completely to achieve a simpler set of langevin equations .",
    "wall hi has three principal effects .",
    "it causes the friction coefficient to diverge strongly as the wall is approached .",
    "secondly , it leads to significant coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "these two effects give rise to a position dependent mobility matrix for the particle motion .",
    "in addition , the stress distribution on the particle surface induces a net hydrodynamic dipole which causes a flow - induced shear - rate dependent force .",
    "the hydrodynamic simplicity of the brad algorithm allows for a greater focus on modeling of receptor - ligand interactions , but it is not clear if the net result of hi on dynamical states in a shear flow can be modeled by a simple renormalization of the friction coefficient .",
    "this may in turn lead to significant errors when model predictions are used to interpret experimental observations or to extract interaction parameters .",
    "the following section presents the model used in this study , which is largely based on the one proposed by  @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a description of the simulation algorithm .",
    "section  [ s : results ] presents a comparison of predictions for high values of @xmath0 obtained in simulations with and without thermal fluctuations , demonstrating that fluctuations are important for low receptor densities even at very large @xmath0 .",
    "a simple model is proposed to explain changes in the state diagram .",
    "the effect of hi is then explored by systematically turning off different contributions to hi , with our results suggesting that the choice of simpler descriptions of hi in adhesive dynamics simulations depends on the value of @xmath0 .",

    "figure [ fig : mys ] maps the space of on- and off - rates showing the five distinct states of motion ( as defined by the criteria table [ tab : table1 ] ) that are obtained at a high pclet number of @xmath112 .",
    "the boundaries between the various regimes depend on the number of receptors . when @xmath5 is reduced to 100 and 10 , from @xmath5=5000 ( with all the other parameters kept the same ) , two significant trends",
    "are observed .",
    "firstly , there is a shift of all boundaries from the upper left region of the state diagram for the @xmath113= 5000 case towards the lower right region , effectively indicating freer motion of the particle as the chance to form bonds with the wall is increasingly reduced .",
    "secondly , there is a progressive disappearance of the rolling state and its conversion into the transient ii regime .",
    "interestingly , we observe that a non - trivial dependence on thermal fluctuations emerges at low receptor densities .",
    "the question we asked is whether a high pclet number of 42566 can be regarded as being equivalent to @xmath114 . in other words , can simulations be run for large @xmath0 values be run by simply turning off the brownian noise term ?",
    "no significant differences are observed in the state diagrams predicted in simulations with and without fluctuations at high shear rates when receptor numbers are large ( at @xmath63 and 100 ) .",
    "the situation changes when @xmath5 is reduced to 10 .",
    "motion states with and without fluctuations in this case are displayed in  fig .",
    "[ fig : mydets10 ] .",
    "we observe somewhat counter - intuitively that in the absence of thermal fluctuation , the firm - adhesion region vanishes completely in contrast to simulations with thermal fluctuations .",
    "there are also significant shifts in the boundaries the other regions at lower on - rates .",
    "for the firm adhesion state to exist , at least one bond must be formed on average so that the particle motion can be completely arrested . in  fig .",
    "[ fig : mydets10 ] , the average number of bonds is 0.96  1.4 in the firm - adhesion regime when fluctuations are turned on .",
    "this is reduced to 0.34  0.48 for the same combination of on- and off - rate when thermal fluctuations are ignored .",
    "figure  [ fig : bondsnr10 ] further shows the variation of the average number of bonds with the bond off - rate @xmath111 at a fixed on - rate of @xmath115 ( represented by the vertical dashed line in the state diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : mydets10 ] ) : the average bond number never reaches one in the absence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ fig : pevelsnr10 ] shows further that the translational as well as angular velocities are considerably reduced to almost zero at low values of @xmath111 ( at fixed @xmath97 ) in the presence of thermal fluctuations unlike the case without noise .",
    "the expansion of the transient region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mydets10 ] can be attributed to a fewer number of bonds controlling the dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bondsnr10 ] ) .",
    "when a single bond is at work , depending upon the off - rate , it can either capture the particle or decelerate it , and the transient ii or transient i states are respectively seen . for rolling to occur ,",
    "whatever the current state of motion is , it should be supported by subsequent formation of bonds .",
    "this can happen when there are at least two bonds on average .",
    "figure  [ fig : bondsnr10 ] shows that the average bond number never reaches 2 for both the cases of with and without fluctuations .",
    "this explains the absence of rolling in the state diagram at low receptor numbers .    when a non - bonded particle is close to the wall , it is forced to spin by the shear flow in the vorticity plane .",
    "as pointed out by korn and schwarz @xcite , although thermal fluctuations in this plane have little effect on the spinning motion about the vorticity axis at very high shear rates , they also cause rotational diffusion about the other two axes of the particle .",
    "the observations above suggest that the effect of this rotational diffusion may facilitate bond formation when the receptor density is very low",
    ". a better understanding of the role of thermal fluctuations at low @xmath5 can be obtained with the help of a toy model that is based on a sphere of radius @xmath4 with just a single receptor and a high density of ligands on the wall , as shown in the schematic diagram in  fig .",
    "[ fig : cricball ] .    , with the plane of the seam parallel to the @xmath116-axis.,width=288 ]    in the absence of fluctuations , as the sphere spins along an axis parallel to the wall with an angular speed of @xmath117 , a bond can form only if the receptor _ initially _ ( at the start of the simulation ) lies in the seam region of width @xmath6 ( the radius of a single receptor ) and area @xmath118 .",
    "the bond number over all possible initial orientations of favourably or unfavourably placed receptors in a large ensemble of independent particles is @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the probability that the single random receptor is favourably located in the seam initially , and @xmath121 is the time - averaged number of bonds on any single favourable trajectory , which in turn is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mean time that a favourably located receptor is bonded or unbonded .",
    "estimates for the mean times ( derived in appendix [ a : cricmodel ] ) lead to @xmath124    there are two important differences if thermal fluctuations are switched on .",
    "firstly , the ensemble of trajectories is no longer segregated _ for all times _ into ones with favourable or unfavourable initial conditions .",
    "even if a particle starts out in an unfavourable initial orientation , rotational diffusion about the non - spin axes can bring the receptor into the seam .",
    "equally , receptors on initially favourably oriented particles can also temporarily move out of the seam .",
    "this diffusion in and out of the seam continually happens for all trajectories in an ensemble which are now statistically completely equivalent to each other .",
    "secondly , over any single long trajectory , we can distinguish times in which the receptor is either bonded and the particle is still ( ignoring the short periods over which a particle is brought to rest after bond formation ) , or times when it is on the seam but unbonded and the particle is rolling , and times when it is outside the seam and the unbonded particle is rolling . in this case ,",
    "@xmath125 estimates of the mean times in this case lead to ( appendix [ a : cricmodel ] ) @xmath126 therefore the ratio @xmath127    with or without fluctuations , when @xmath39 is large at any fixed @xmath38 , the expressions above lead to the expected result that the mean number of bonds is low , indicating free motion .",
    "as @xmath39 is decreased however the bond average @xmath128 whereas @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , with fluctuations , a transition from free - motion to firm - adhesion should be seen . ,",
    "whereas in their absence , firm adhesion is never observed since @xmath130 .",
    "thus , fluctuations about the non - spin axes are essential for binding at low number of receptors .",
    "figure  [ fig : bondsnr10 ] corroborates this toy model , showing that at lower off - rates , @xmath131 approaches 1 in the presence of fluctuation while @xmath132 in the absence of fluctuations .",
    "krobath _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed another situation where a non - trivial enhancement in bond formation is brought about by thermal fluctuations .",
    "receptors in fluctuating membranes bind to wall ligands in a co - operative manner since changes in flexible membrane conformation when one receptor binds increases the chances that other receptors nearby can also bind .",
    "this co - operativity leads to a stronger sensitivity to receptor and ligand concentrations and potentially larger number of bonds relative to the case where there are no fluctuations and the membrane surface is completely rigid . in the case of a spherical particle",
    "however , thermal diffusion enhances the number of bonds by bringing in receptors into the zone where they can bond with ligands ; there is no co - operativity involved , since we consider a rigid particle and wall with immobilized receptors and ligands .",
    "further , our analysis suggest that , if the temperature dependence of the on- and off- rate constants is ignored , the relative number of bonds formed at steady - state compared to the case of zero fluctuations is independent of temperature itself .",
    "temperature just influences the time scale over which this steady - state is established . at zero temperature ,",
    "a receptor particle is locked in its initial seam or non - seam location forever .",
    "the relative number of bonds formed is temperature dependent n the case of co - operative binding in membranes @xcite .",
    "we next turn to understanding which aspects of hi with the wall are most important in determining adhesion dynamics .",
    "these wall interactions enter the governing equations in three ways .",
    "firstly , the drag coefficients represented by the diagonal part of the mobility matrix @xmath133 sensitively depend upon on the distance @xmath26 of the particle from the wall ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "secondly , hi leads to a coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom through the non - diagonal terms of @xmath133 .",
    "a further third contribution arises from the shear - induced dipole which is represented by the force @xmath134 .",
    "we examine each of these effects of hi by selectively switching off appropriate terms in the simulations ( while keeping thermal fluctuations on ) . in simulations with",
    "no hi , the mobility matrix is position independent , specifically , the diagonal terms are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which correspond to the force and the torque , respectively .",

    "there are however clear qualitative differences between the no - hi , partial - hi with only the diagonal mobility matrix , and the full - hi cases , suggesting that the translation - rotation coupling due to the off - diagonal terms of the mobility matrix is not important under conditions of high shear - rate and large receptor numbers .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : hiphinohi ] that hi appears to have little effect on the boundary between free motion the other regimes .",

    "since inertia is negligible , the bond forces are balanced by the total hydrodynamic force , @xmath140 . in dimensionless form , the bell equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : koff ] ) ) governing the off - rate is therefore @xmath141 .",
    "the dimensionless hydrodynamic force acting on the sphere with full - hi is approximately @xmath142 , where @xmath26 is the average particle distance from the wall , @xmath143 is the correction to the drag coefficient due to the presence of wall and arising from the diagonal components of the mobility matrix , and @xmath144 is the shear - induced dipole contribution . in the complete absence of hi ,",
    "the drag force is smaller and just equal to @xmath145 .",
    "since we consider particles much larger in size than bond lengths , @xmath26 does not change much between the no - hi and full hi cases .",
    "therefore , bonds are least stretched when hi is ignored , and most stretched with full hi : that is , hi always favours bond dissociation and requires smaller off - rates to achieve freer states of motion when compared with the no - hi case . on the other hand , larger on rates @xmath97 clearly require larger off rates @xmath146 to a give state of motion different from full adhesion . at higher values of @xmath111",

    "in contrast , at @xmath148 they approach zero at different values of @xmath111 .",

    "the velocities at @xmath151 approach zero at about the same value of @xmath111 demonstrating the independence of the state diagram from hi at high values of @xmath97 .",

    "our results firstly show that simulations of microparticles in shear flows must be wary of turning off thermal noise at high shear - rates .",
    "even when the peclt number is very large , the rotational diffusion out of the vorticity plane caused by thermal fluctuations are particularly important at lower receptor densities and serve to bring receptors into the contact zone for binding with ligands . switching off thermal fluctuations in simulations at high shear rates with the naive argument that fluctuations are unimportant under such conditions can lead to qualitatively incorrect predictions of various states of motion and the transitions between these with changes in on- and off - rates .",
    "similarly , it is sometimes argued in the interests of simplicity and faster simulations that hi with the wall can be ignored and replaced by just a constant mobility coefficient to obtain qualitative insight .",
    "our simulations indicate that the role of hi is not just to simply renormalize the friction coefficient .",
    "the divergence of the friction coefficient as the particle approaches the wall and the shear - induced dipole are observed to be significantly contribute but to differing extents which depend on the on- and off - rates as well as the peclt number . on the other hand",
