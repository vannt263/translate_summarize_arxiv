    "if black hole evaporation is assumed to preserve unitarity , a range of arguments based on quantum correlations @xcite suggest that physics at the slowly - shrinking horizon may differ significantly from the innocuous picture that underlies hawking s original derivation of black hole radiation within curved spacetime quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "in particular , almheiri _",
    "et al _ @xcite have argued that the horizon will be replaced by a region of high curvature , a `` firewall '' , which will destroy any observer who attempts to fall into the black hole .",
    "reviews with extensive references can be found in @xcite .",
    "a key element in the firewall argument as formulated in @xcite is that the conventional quantum field theory picture of black hole evaporation involves strong quantum correlations between the black hole interior and exterior , and the assumption of unitary evolution of the full system turns out to preclude such correlations . in this paper",
    "we examine the consequences of severing closely similar correlations across a killing horizon in a system in which the requisite quantum state can be readily written down : a conformal scalar field in @xmath5 spacetime dimensions . for concreteness",
    ", we take the spacetime to be minkowski , so that the sense of thermality is that of the unruh effect of uniform acceleration  @xcite , and we induce a firewall by breaking the correlations across the rindler horizon .",
    "the killing horizon in @xmath0-dimensional black hole spacetimes with a kruskal - like global structure could be treated in the same manner , with similar conclusions .",
    "we shall not attempt to examine how the spacetime geometry might react to the firewall singularity of the scalar field on the rindler horizon , but we shall examine how the singularity of the scalar field affects a particle detector that falls through the horizon .",
    "we consider a two - level unruh - dewitt ( udw ) detector that couples linearly to the scalar field @xcite , and its modification that couples linearly to the proper time derivative of the field @xcite .",
    "the reasons to consider the derivative - coupling detector are twofold .",
    "first , for quantum states that are regular in the hadamard sense  @xcite , the derivative - coupling detector is insensitive to the infrared ambiguity in the wightman function of the @xmath0-dimensional conformal field .",
    "second , the short - distance behaviour of the @xmath0-dimensional derivative - coupling udw detector is similar to that of the @xmath6-dimensional udw detector with a non - derivative coupling  @xcite .",
    "we may hence expect a derivative - coupling detector in @xmath5 dimensions to be a good model for a non - derivative detector that crosses a @xmath6-dimensional firewall .",
    "we recall that the non - derivative udw detector in @xmath6 dimensions models the @xmath7 term by which an atomic electron couples to the quantised electromagnetic field when there is no angular momentum exchange @xcite .",
    "we shall show that crossing the rindler firewall has a nonzero and sudden but _",
    "finite _ effect on the detector s transition probability , within first - order perturbation theory . in terms of the detector s energy gap  @xmath3 ,",
    "the difference from the minkowski vacuum transition probability is proportional to @xmath1 for the non - derivative detector and to @xmath2 for the derivative - coupling detector both in the limit of a large energy gap and in the limit of adiabatic switching .",
    "we consider also a generalisation to a quantum state in which rindler excitations are added behind the rindler horizon in a way that has been suggested @xcite to model the `` energetic curtain '' of @xcite in a black hole spacetime .",
    "we show that in this state the response across the horizon is again finite but can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the temperature parameter that characterises the added excitations .",
    "we begin by reviewing in sections [ sec : detector ] and [ sec : minkowski ] the two - level udw detector and its derivative - coupling generalisation , coupled to a massless scalar field in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the rindler firewall quantum state is constructed in section [ sec : firewallstate - def ] , and we discuss the sense in which it models the stationary aspects of the black hole firewall of  @xcite .",
    "the response of an inertial detector that crosses the rindler horizon in this state is analysed in section  [ sec : resp - across ] , deferring technical steps to two appendices .",
    "section [ sec : curtain ] addresses the generalisation to a state in which excitations have been added behind the rindler horizon .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] presents a summary and concluding remarks , including a discussion of detectors with multiple levels .",

    "we refer to the detector as a two - level detector .",
    "the analysis will cover also the special case @xmath18 in which the two states are degenerate in their energy .",
    "we start with arbitrary spacetime dimension but will shortly specify to @xmath5 .",
    "we couple the detector to a real scalar field @xmath19 via the interaction hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a coupling constant , @xmath22 is the detector s monopole moment operator , the parameter @xmath23 is a non - negative integer , and the switching function @xmath24 specifies how the interaction is switched on an off .",
    "we assume @xmath24 to be take non - negative real values and to be smooth with compact support .",
    "for @xmath25 the detector couples to the value of the field at the detector s location , and for @xmath26 the detector couples to the @xmath23th - order proper time derivative of the field at the detector s location . for the reasons discussed in section [ sec : intro ] we shall mainly be interested in the cases @xmath25 , which is the usual udw detector @xcite , and @xmath27 @xcite , but we shall keep the value of @xmath23 general until it needs to be specified .    taking the detector to be initially in the state @xmath13 and the field to be in a ( for the moment pure ) state  @xmath28 , and working in first - order perturbation theory in  @xmath21 , the probability for the detector to have made a transition to the state @xmath14 after the interaction has ceased can be written for all @xmath23 by a straightforward adaptation of the @xmath25 analysis @xcite .",
    "the outcome is @xmath29 where the response function @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 and the correlation function @xmath32 is the pull - back of the wightman function in the state @xmath28 to the detector s worldline , @xmath33 the integrals in are understood in the distributional sense , and they are well defined whenever @xmath28 is hadamard @xcite , which we shall assume until this needs to be relaxed in sections [ sec : resp - across ] and  [ sec : curtain ] . for mixed states",

    "our construction of the rindler firewall state @xmath78 relied on the fact that the right - moving and left - moving components of a massless field are decoupled in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "( related consequences of this decoupling for past - future correlations have been investigated in  @xcite . )",
    "@xmath78  is not hadamard at the rindler horizon , and we found that the wightman function of @xmath78 contains a heightened version of the @xmath0-dimensional infrared ambiguity .",
    "in particular we found that the response of the derivative - coupling detector is ambiguous by an additive lorentz - noninvariant constant , even though this detector is free from infrared ambiguities in hadamard states  @xcite .",
    "it could be interesting to investigate whether such ambiguities are present for the derivative - coupling detector in firewall - type states in which a severing of correlations evolves from an initially regular state by some dynamical mechanism .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath78 is undoubtedly singular at the rindler horizon , as seen from the non - hadamard form of the wightman function , and from the way in which the detector s response hinges on the coupling strength at the horizon - crossing moment .",
    "@xmath78  is hence qualitatively different from an evaporating @xmath0-dimensional black hole in the cghs model , where the outcome is a long - lived remnant  @xcite , and from a @xmath0-dimensional moving - mirror system that models a remnant  @xcite .",
    "we have not attempted to characterise the singularity in @xmath78 in terms of a stress - energy tensor , or by other means that might indicate how the spacetime responds to the singularity when allowed to become dynamical . however , our main observation is that when the spacetime is assumed to be unaffected by the singularity in  @xmath78 , the response of the detector that falls across the horizon is , while sudden , nevertheless finite .",
    "our udw detector had two internal states .",
    "if the detector s internal hilbert space is generalised to that of a harmonic oscillator , it would be usual to take @xmath22 in to be the oscillator s position operator , @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the oscillator s angular frequency and @xmath170 are the annihilation and creation operator pair @xcite . for the non - derivative detector in @xmath4 dimensions , this choice for @xmath22 models the @xmath171 term by which an atomic electron couples to the quantised electromagnetic field when there is no angular momentum exchange @xcite . with this choice , @xmath22 has nonvanishing matrix elements only between neighbouring energy eigenstates , and the only nonvanishing first - order transition probabilities from detector state @xmath172 are to detector states @xmath173 and @xmath174 , given by our formulas with @xmath175 .",
    "the conclusion about a finite detector response on crossing the firewall hence still holds .",
    "if however @xmath22 were chosen to have matrix elements of equal magnitude between each pair of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates , the sum of the first - order transition probabilities from state @xmath172 to all other states would diverge for the derivative - coupling detector , because of the leading term proportional to @xmath176 at large  @xmath177 , but be still finite for the non - derivative detector , because the leading term is only proportional to @xmath178 .",
    "we considered also a generalisation of @xmath78 in which excitations are added behind the rindler horizon in a way that has been suggested @xcite to model the energetic curtain of  @xcite .",
    "we found that the response is qualitatively similar to that in @xmath78 but can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the temperature - like parameter that characterises the added excitations .    finally , recall that the short - distance behaviour of the wightman function becomes more singular as the spacetime dimension increases .",
    "one may hence expect an udw detector in dimensions higher than @xmath5 to react to a firewall more violently  @xcite .",
    "however , the short - distance behaviour of the derivative - coupling detector in @xmath5 dimensions is similar to that of the non - derivative detector in @xmath4 dimensions @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate a two - level unruh - dewitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field or its proper time derivative in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime , in a quantum state whose correlation structure across the rindler horizon mimics the stationary aspects of a firewall that almheiri _ et al _ have argued to ensue in an evaporating black hole spacetime . within first - order perturbation theory , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the detector s response on falling through the horizon is sudden but finite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference from the minkowski vacuum response is proportional to @xmath1 for the non - derivative detector and to @xmath2 for the derivative - coupling detector , both in the limit of a large energy gap @xmath3 and in the limit of adiabatic switching . </S>",
    "<S> adding to the quantum state high rindler temperature excitations behind the horizon increases the detector s response proportionally to the temperature ; this situation has been suggested to model the energetic curtain proposal of braunstein _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. we speculate that the @xmath0-dimensional derivative - coupling detector may be a good model for a non - derivative detector that crosses a firewall in @xmath4 dimensions . </S>"
