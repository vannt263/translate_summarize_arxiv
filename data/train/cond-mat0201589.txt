    "when a fluid is pushed by a less viscous one in a narrow space between two parallel plates ( a device known as hele - shaw cell ) , the saffman - taylor instability arises  @xcite .",
    "this hydrodynamic instability results in the complex evolution of the moving interface between the fluids , producing a wide range of patterns  @xcite . since the pioneering work of saffman and taylor  @xcite , these visually striking , viscous fingering patterns have been extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "one noteworthy distinction between experimental and theoretical work on the saffman - taylor problem is that the measurements usually reveal disturbances associated with friction at the sidewalls of the hele - shaw cell , while most theoretical studies sidestep this problem by assuming periodic boundary conditions . in principle",
    ", rigid - wall boundary conditions would be closer to an experimental realization of the problem .",
    "however , the use of periodic boundary conditions , as opposed to rigid - wall ones in theoretical investigations of the saffman - taylor problem has been a matter of interest and debate during the last few decades  @xcite .    in the early 1990",
    "s an attempt to measure the flow in a cell which approximates the periodic boundary conditions of the theory has been performed by zhao and maher  @xcite .",
    "their interesting experimental work considered gravity - driven viscous flow within a _ cylindrical _ hele - shaw cell ( two coaxial cylinders separated by a small gap ) of large radius of curvature . to drive the system",
    "gravitationally they allowed the fluids to form a stable flat interface , and then invert the cell to put the denser fluid on the top .",
    "the fluids used in  @xcite had almost the same viscosity ( low viscosity contrast ) , such that the process of finger competition leads to a nearly up - down symmetric interface .",
    "the main goal in ref .",
    "@xcite was to directly compare viscous fingering flow in a cylindrical cell with flow in a conventional , flat , rectangular cell , and verify if the rigid sidewalls could be viewed as having been replaced with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "comparison of the pattern evolution observed in the cylindrical cell experiment  @xcite with similar measurements in rectangular cells with sidewalls  @xcite , shows that periodic boundary conditions yield _ few differences _ of results .",
    "moreover , the cylindrical cell patterns also look very similar to computer simulation results obtained by tryggvason and aref  @xcite , who used periodic boundary conditions in a flat rectangular cell .",
    "the experimental results presented in  @xcite suggest that , for large radius of curvature and low viscosity contrast , there are no significant changes made in the statistical properties of the saffman - taylor flow by friction at the boundaries . in other words , it seems that the boundaries affect the dynamics in much the same way whether they are provided by periodic boundary conditions or by the presence of physical sidewalls .",
    "although the majority of flow features survive the elimination of sidewall friction , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite were not able to perform a meaningful test of growth rates in the linear regime due to experimental disturbances other than rigid - wall ones , related to the inversion of the cell .",
    "it is worth noting that sidewall effects are more prominent in cases with higher viscosity contrast  @xcite .    despite the relevance and simplicity of the experimental work carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a theoretical analysis of the viscous fingering instability in a cylindrical hele - shaw cell is lacking in the literature .",
    "a theoretical study of flow in cylindrical cells , could yield new insigth into the possible causes that may contribute to the few differences of results detected in  @xcite . in this work ,",

    ", it suffices to focus on a single fluid .",
    "the starting point of our calculation is a coordinate - free representation of the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid @xmath11 and the navier - stokes equation @xmath12 = - { \\nabla } p + \\eta { \\nabla}^{2 } { \\bf u } + \\rho { \\bf g},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the three - dimensional fluid velocity and @xmath14 is the hydrodynamic pressure .",

    "the linear solution to eq .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) we can extract two relevant parameters : ( i ) the critical wave number @xmath71 [ defined by setting @xmath72 , beyond which all modes are linearly stable ; and ( ii ) the fastest growing mode @xmath73 which maximizes @xmath74 , and dominates the initial dynamics of the interface .",
    "note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 show no dependence on the radius of curvature @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 that depicts the linear growth rate  ( [ lambda ] ) as a function of @xmath77 , in the flat cell limit ( dashed curve ) and for a cylindrical cell with @xmath78 ( solid curve ) . note that for both cases the peak location and width of the band of unstable modes remain unchanged , independently of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "differences in behavior between flow in cylindrical and flat cells are more pronounced around @xmath76 .",
    "these facts can be interpreted as follows : since @xmath62 , if one increases the cell s radius of curvature @xmath0 , the number of fingers @xmath42 at the two - fluid interface is also increased in order to keep the fastest growing @xmath77 constant .",
    "now we turn our attention to the weakly nonlinear flow stage .",
    "we begin by discussing finger competition dynamics .",
    "it is well known that the viscosity contrast @xmath79 has a crucial role in determining interfacial behavior for flow in flat rectangular cells  @xcite . for low viscosity contrast ( @xmath80 )",
    "the interface is nearly up - down symmetric , and increasingly larger asymmetry is observed for larger values of @xmath79 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath79 has great influence on the dynamics of finger competition and pattern selection . in cylindrical cells ,",
    "in addition to the parameter @xmath79 , it is of interest to examine how finger competition dynamics is affected by radius of curvature @xmath0 ( or correspondingly , by the correction factor @xmath67 ) .    in order to investigate finger competition",
    "we consider the influence of a fundamental mode , on the growth of its sub - harmonic . to do that we rewrite the net perturbation  ( [ z ] ) in terms of cosine and sine modes , where the cosine @xmath82 and sine @xmath83 amplitudes are real - valued .",
    "then , for consistent second order expressions , we replace the time derivative terms @xmath84 and @xmath85 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ modecoupling ] ) by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "we consider a dominant fundamental of wave number @xmath88 , and a sub - harmonic of wave number @xmath89 and relatively weaker amplitude . without loss of generality",
    "we may take @xmath90 and @xmath91 . under these circumstances ,",
    "we obtain the following equations of motion for sine and cosine sub - harmonic @xmath92~{a}_{k_s},\\ ] ] @xmath93~{b}_{k_s}.\\ ] ] note that if @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the fundamental accelerates the growth of the sub - harmonic cosine and inhibits the sub - harmonic sine mode .",
    "this causes increased variability among the lengths of fingers of less viscous fluid 1 penetrating more viscous fluid 2 .",
    "this effect describes finger competition . as was in flat cells , interface asymmetry and finger competition",
    "are enhanced to a degree proportional to @xmath79 .    although the second order term @xmath96 ( see eq .",
    "( [ thirdterms ] ) ) has no explicit dependence on @xmath0 , the coupling between modes @xmath97 and @xmath98 makes the interface dynamics sensitive to the background cylindrical geometry . from equations  ( [ illustration1 ] ) and  ( [ illustration2 ] )",
    "we see that for a given @xmath79 , the degree of competition and up - down asymmetry depend on the overall multiplicative term @xmath99 , which in turn is proportional to the correction factor @xmath67 . to illustrate the combined influence of @xmath79 and @xmath0 on finger competition , we plot in fig .",

    "3 the dashed line corresponds to the flat cell limit , while the solid line expresses behavior for a cylindrical cell with @xmath101 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "3 that the discrepancies between flow in cylindrical and flat cells are more noticeable for increasingly larger values of _ both _ @xmath79 and @xmath2 . therefore ,",
    "with respect to finger competition , the flow will be more stable with the increase of the cylindrical cell radius @xmath0 . geometrically speaking",
    ", we can say that the mean curvature @xmath102 of the cylindrical cell intensifies the competition among fingers in comparison with that of rectangular , planar flow .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly discussing the possibility of occurrence of finger tip - splitting in cylindrical cells .",
    "tip - splitting is related to the influence of a fundamental mode @xmath97 on the growth of its harmonic @xmath103  @xcite . by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ modecoupling ] ) in terms of sine and cosine modes , and considering the coupling between @xmath97 and @xmath104 , we verify that the harmonic mode can not be influenced by the fundamental .",
    "therefore , at second order , there is no tendency for the fingers to split in cylindrical cells .",
    "tip - splitting is absent for any value of the cell s radius of curvature @xmath0 , including the flat cell limit @xmath105 .",
    "this fact may be interpreted in geometric terms as follows : unlike finger competition behavior , which depends on , and varies with the cylinder s _ mean _ curvature @xmath106 , finger tip - splitting is controlled by _",
    "curvature  @xcite which is zero for a cylinder . in this sence ,",
    "the absence of tip - splitting in cylindrical cells was expected .",
    "in this paper we investigated viscous flow in cylindrical hele - shaw cells analytically .",

    "a generalized version of darcy s law was derived from first principles .",

    "we deduced the following general results : on the linear level , there is an inhibition of growth for increasingly larger radius of curvature @xmath0 ; and , for sligthly nonlinear stages , we found that finger competition and interface asymmetry are enhanced for flow in cylindrical cells .",
    "in addition , we explained the absence of tip - splitting events in cylindrical cells .",
    "the study of geometry - related corrections @xmath67 for the case @xmath107 could be interesting to study in the future . within this limit , and following the lines of recent work by ruyer - quil  @xcite and by meignin _",
