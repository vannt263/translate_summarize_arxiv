    "the present time has been referred to as the `` golden age '' of precision cosmology .",
    "strong gravitational lensing data is a rich source of information about the structure and dynamics of the universe , and these data are contributing significantly to this notion of precision cosmology .",
    "strong gravitational lens studies are highly dependent on the software used to create the models and analyze the components such as lens mass , einstein radius , time delays etc .",
    "a comprehensive review of available software has been conducted by @xcite .",
    "while many such software packages are available , most studies utilize only a single software package for analysis .",
    "furthermore , most authors of strong gravitational lensing studies use their own software only .",
    "more recently , the status of comparison studies of strong gravitational lens models has been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "this study demonstrated that changes in redshift affect time delay and mass calculations in a model dependent fashion , with variable results with small changes in redshift for the same models .",
    "an important resource for the conduct of comparison studies is the orphan lens project , a compendium of information about strong lens systems that as of may 2014 contained data for 656 lens systems @xcite .",
    "there are a number of barriers to the conduct of lens model comparisons .",
    "ideally , a comparison study of a previously studied lens would include the original model for comparison , but this is sometimes impossible because the lens model code is not made publicly available .",
    "another barrier to performing comparative studies is the complexity of the lens model files , since there are major differences among the commonly used model software available . in order to facilitate this step of the process",
    "the hydralens program was developed to generate model files for multiple strong gravitational lens model packages @xcite .",
    "to date , the largest comparison study of strong gravitational lens models was an analysis of macsj1206.2 - 0847 as part of the clash survey conducted by @xcite .",
    "this study included four different strong gravitational lens models including lenstool ( @xcite ) , pixelens ( @xcite ) , lensperfect ( @xcite ) and sawlens ( @xcite ) .",
    "the authors conducted five lens model analyses using the same data , and is thus categorized as a direct and semi - independent study .",
    "this type of study has great advantages in that all data and all models are available for direct comparison in a single study .    the hubble space telescope ( hst ) frontier fields project is reporting preliminary results @xcite . this important deep field observing program combines the power of the hst with gravitational lenses .",
    "lensing analysis in the frontier fields project includes models from a number of software codes including zb , grale , lenstool , and two other non - ltm lens model software codes which facilitate direct comparison of results from a number of lens models rather than depending on a single model from which to draw conclusions .",
    "the hubble frontier fields analysis uses models that are independently developed and optimized by each group of investigators for each code used .",
    "the power of this approach has been reported , with more results surely to follow @xcite .",
    "the goal of this study is to directly compare the results of calculations among four model software codes in the evaluation of four lens systems .",
    "the present study has several unique features .",
    "this study is the first to use computer - aided lens model design , using hydralens software to facilitate lens model generation.there are no previous single studies which compare the results for multiple lens systems using multiple lens model software .",
    "this study was designed to further evaluate comparative lens model analyses and includes both direct and indirect semi - independent studies of four lens systems using four different software models .",
    "other studies have included indirect comparisons to previous lens model analyses , or direct comparisons of several lens models of a single lens system .",
    "this is the first study to also include combined indirect and direct analyses where previously published lens models were used for direct comparisons .",
    "the nomenclature of lens model comparison studies , lens systems studied , previous lens model studies of these systems and the lens model software used are described in section  [ methods ] .",
    "the results of the lens model studies for each of the four systems studied are presented in section  [ results ] and a review of existing comparison studies along with the results of this study are presented in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "conclusions and suggestions for future lens model studies are in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the use of standardized nomenclature to describe lensing studies is useful to evaluate multiple studies . in this paper",
    "we follow the nomenclature previously described @xcite .",
    "lens model comparison studies are referred to as direct when the comparison is made based on calculations using two software models in the same paper , and indirect when comparison is made to previously published data . in this study , we also use the actual models from published studies ( kindly supplied by the investigators ) so these are considered combined indirect / direct comparisons .",
    "lens model comparisons using the same data are referred to as semi - independent , and when different data is used , the comparison is independent .",
    "lastly , software is classified as light traces mass ( ltm , formerly known as parametric ) , or non light traces mass ( non - ltm , formerly known as non - parametric ) .",
    "each lens model software package uses a different input data format to describe the lens model .",
    "all of them use simple text files as input , but the format of the text files , available functionality and command structures are dependent on the particular software .",
    "some lens model software uses multiple accessory files to provide other data .",
    "each of them has a unique list of commands , with great variability .",
    "hydralens @xcite was written to simplify the process of creating lens model input files to facilitate direct comparison studies , and to assist those starting in the field .",
    "the four lens systems were evaluated using four lens model codes , necessitating 16 different models . the lenstool model for cosmos j095930 + 023427 was kindly provided by cao @xcite . the glafic model for sdss j1320 + 1644 was kindly provided by rusu @xcite . the remaining 14 models were written for this study using hydralens . in the case of cosmos j095930 + 023427 and sdss j1320 + 1644 , the two lens models we received from other investigators were used as input to hydralens which generated the models for the other three software packages used in this study . in the case of sdss j1430 + 4105 and j1000",

    "the lens model files were then used as input to the respective lens model software .",
    "the parameters used for the four lens systems was obtained from previous studies .",
    "the geometry for each system was identical in all four models evaluated , and therefore all studies conducted are classified as semi - independent lens analyses .",
    "three of the lens systems studied are listed in the orphan lens database @xcite including cosmos j095930 + 023427 , sdss j1320 + 1644 and sdssj1430 + 4105 .",
    "the lens cosmos j095930 was first described by jackson @xcite .",
    "cosmos j095930 is an early - type galaxy with four bright images of a distant background source .",
    "it is located at @xmath0=0.892 , and the background source is estimated at @xmath1=2.00 . while the exact @xmath1 is unknown , the value used by previous investigators is 2.00 .",
    "models of this system were described by faure using lenstool @xcite .",
    "this model used a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) with external shear ( @xmath2 ) and found an einstein radius of 0.79 \" and @xmath3=255 km s@xmath4 .",
    "more recently , an extensive multi - wavelength study of this system was reported by cao and colleagues @xcite , also using lenstool .",
    "this analysis used four different models , an sie with two singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) as well as a pseudo - isothermal elliptical mass distribution ( piemd ) model with two sis , both with and without external shear @xcite .",
    "we selected the sie+sis+sis model used by cao as the basis of the present indirect comparison with their work as well as the direct comparisons with the four lens models studied here .",
    "the lenstool model developed by cao and coworkers was kindly supplied for this study and used as a baseline model which was then translated into input files for the other software by hydralens .",
    "the lenstool model used by cao included priors for the values of ellipticity ( @xmath5 $ ] ) and position angle ( pa= [ -90,90 ] for the sie potential ) and for the velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 $ ] for all three potentials ) .",
    "these same priors were used in the models of cosmos j095930 for lensmodel and glafic in this study .",
    "the lenstool model developed by cao uses optimization in the source plane .",
    "the image positions used in all models of this system were taken from table 1 in cao @xcite .",

    "the models used here were similarly parameterized .",
    "the present study is an indirect comparison with the analysis of cao @xcite as well as a direct comparison of the four lens models studied . since we were provided the model used by cao , it is a combined indirect / direct comparative analysis of cosmos j095930 .",

    "sdssj1320 + 1644 was initially described by @xcite and @xcite , and is a large separation lensed quasar candidate identified in the sdss , with a separation of @xmath10 @xmath110.002 at @xmath1=1.487 @xcite .",
    "both an elliptical and disk - like galaxy were identified almost symmetrically between the quasars at redshift @xmath0=0.899 .",
    "a detailed lens model analysis of this system was conducted by @xcite , using glafic software .",
    "based on their analysis , they conclude that sdssj1320 + 1644 is a probable gravitationally lensed quasar , and if it is , this would be the largest separation two - imaged lensed quasar known .",
    "they show that the gravitational lens hypothesis implies that the galaxies are not isolated , but are embedded in a dark matter halo , using an nfw model and an sis model .",
    "the sis model has a @xmath3=645@xmath12 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we use the sis free model as the basis of the comparison study , as defined by @xcite , which models the three galaxies ( referred to as g1 , g2 and g4 ) as sis potentials and leaves the position of the dark matter halo ( also modeled as a sis ) as a free parameter .",

    "the ellipticity and position angle are used when the position of the dark matter halo is fixed .",

    "a number of glafic models developed by rusu and coworkers were kindly supplied for this comparative analysis and used as a baseline model which was then translated by hydralens into models for the other software .",
    "the present study includes an indirect comparison with the analysis of rusu @xcite as well as a direct comparison of the four software lens models studied .",

    "best - fit lens model parameters from previous studies are presented along with the results from this study for each system .",
    "the results reported for each lens were intended to follow the format of the data for best - fit lens parameters as reported in previous studies , and therefore there are some differences in the data presented for the four lens systems .",

    "the data reported by @xcite are at the upper portion of the table , and show the results of the lenstool model",
    ". the results in this study using the lenstool model are somewhat different because the model in this study used optimization in the image plane , rather than the source plane optimization used by cao .",

    "the image plane for a representative model calculated using lenstool is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the image positions change from the input positions because of the image tracing algorithm used .",
    "this slight difference may account for the differences seen in time delay and magnification .",
    "lenstool identifies 16 total images , which are nearly superimposed at the original positions of the four images shown in figure 1 .",
    "each of the models uses somewhat different optimization schemes , and the velocity dispersions are a result of optimization , which may explain some of the differences shown in table [ table : j095930 ] .",
    "the differences in the results among the three software programs is not surprising , since this model had all three velocity dispersions as free - parameters .",

    "furthermore , this study has shown at least in one situation that the software version used can significantly affect the results which stresses the importance of specifying the software version number being used in all future studies , in addition to the hardware / operating system platform . it is also suggested that more detail is provided in future studies to allow reproducibility of the models such as the number and types of potentials used along with the name of the potential used in the various software packages .",

    "<S> analysis of strong gravitational lensing data is important in this era of precision cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of the present study is to directly compare the analysis of strong gravitational lens systems using different lens model software and similarly parameterized models to understand the differences and limitations of the resulting models . </S>",
    "<S> the software lens model translation tool , hydralens , was used to generate multiple models for four strong lens systems including cosmos j095930 + 023427 , sdss j1320 + 1644 , sdssj1430 + 4105 and j1000 + 0021 . </S>",
    "<S> all four lens systems were modeled with pixelens , lenstool , glafic , and lensmodel . </S>",
    "<S> the input data and parameterization of each lens model was similar for the four model programs used to highlight differences in the output results . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the einstein radius and enclosed mass for each lens model was comparable . </S>",
    "<S> the results were more dissimilar if the masses of more than one lens potential were free - parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the image tracing algorithms of the software are different , resulting in different output image positions and differences in time delay and magnification calculations , as well as ellipticity and position angle of the resulting lens model . in a comparison of different software versions using identical model input files , </S>",
    "<S> results differed significantly when using two versions of the same software . </S>",
    "<S> these results further support the need for future lensing studies to include multiple lens models , use of open software , availability of lens model files use in studies , and computer challenges to develop new approaches . </S>",
    "<S> future studies need a standard nomenclature and specification of the software used to allow improved interpretation , reproducibility and transparency of results . </S>"
