    "the order book is the double auction mechanism  @xcite which permits to process and store the orders placed by investors in a modern financial market .",
    "this system is the elementary mechanism of price formation as a consequence of the arrival of proposals ( orders ) of buying or selling .",
    "there are two classes of orders : market orders and limit orders .",
    "the market ones correspond to orders to buy / sell at the best available price ( called best bid / ask ) , hence they are immediately executed .",
    "the limit orders instead are orders to buy or sell at a given price which can be not necessarily the best one . by consequence limit orders may not immediately fulfilled and then they are stored in the order book .",
    "the difference between the best ask and the best bid is defined as the spread @xmath0 .",
    "the order prices are not continuous but discrete and expressed in units of ticks .",
    "also the volume of an order is an integer multiple of a certain amount of shares .",
    "the mid - price between best ask and best bid can be considered a conventional definition of the price of a stock .",
    "the majority of the spread variations are due to a limit order which falls inside the spread or to a market order which matches all the orders placed at the best price .",
    "+ in recent years the complex dynamics of the order book has attracted the scientific community attention .",
    "one of the reasons of this increasing interest is the availability of a large amount of experimental data which has permitted an extensive statistical analysis of the order book properties and has revealed a number of interesting features and regularities .",
    "the main empirical evidences of the order book are : the fat - tailed distribution of the price of new limit orders @xcite ; the non - trivial power law correlation of the transaction price signs  @xcite ; the peculiar shape of the limit order volume distribution with fat tails and peaked away from the best quote  @xcite ; the non linear response of the order book to order arrivals  @xcite .",
    "+ moreover the microscopic market level of the order book shows the stylized facts present in financial markets at the aggregate level  @xcite . to interpret these empirical evidences a series of theoretical models",
    "has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the models by farmer et al .",
    "@xcite show as even a `` zero intelligence '' mechanism can reproduce many of the experimental features of real order books .",
    "+ in a previous work we have introduced a model  @xcite where the zero intelligence paradigm is adopted and in this paper we are going to interpret some experimental results in the framework of this model .",
    "+ one of the most challenging issue in this field is the identification of new empirical features in order to discriminate and validate the various models proposed . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects induced by the discrete nature of order books .",
    "in fact , as we have already noticed , the price of the orders is not a continuous variable but it can only be a multiple of a quantity called tick which is a fraction of the currency used in the the market considered .",
    "a first consequence of this aspect is the spontaneous emergence of asymmetries in the system .",
    "for instance , two configurations of the order book with an even spread or an odd one ( in units of ticks ) are not _ a priori _ equivalent for the mechanism of deposition of limit orders inside the spread .",
    "we investigate the fraction of odd spreads for a data set from the nyse market finding indeed a strong evidence for this asymmetry .",
    "however , as we are going to see in detail in the paper , the problem is more subtle than expected and also the agent strategies play an important role to explain quantitatively this phenomenon .",
    "the strategic order placement is also the origin of the non - trivial relaxation pattern observed when a spread fluctuation takes place . + the paper is organized in the following way .",

    "+ finally conclusions and perspectives are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "in this section we show the empirical evidences that have led us to investigate the asymmetric nature of the order book .",
    "+ in our analysis of the order book we have considered a data set which spans a period of nearly 80 trading days between october 2004 and february 2005 .",
    "this data set includes a series of high - frequency ( tick - by - tick ) information for 20 stocks from the nyse market .",
    "these stocks have been chosen to be heterogeneous in their level of capitalization .",
    "the information we have for each stock is the whole list of transactions and quotes , which are the prices of effective deals and of orders respectively .",
    "our data set lacks the information about the whole order book apart of the best bid and the best ask . therefore a new quote appears only if the best bid or the best ask have been updated . from this data set",
    "we have reconstructed the sequence of market and limit orders by looking to the spread variations .",
    "if the spread has increased with respect to its previous value we refer to the event as a market order . on the contrary",
    ", the event is defined as a limit order if the spread has decreased .",
    "we assume that the probability that a cancellation of a limit order may change the spread is so small to be neglected .",
    "we have also expressed all the prices in units of ticks , so the spread results to be an integer number . at the end of this refinement , our data set",
    "is composed only by the series of the events in which the spread has changed , each labelled to be a market or a limit order . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to limit order events . the complete analysis , including also market orders , will be matter of future researches .",
    "to investigate the intrinsic asymmetry that a discrete and finite spread generates , we have firstly analyzed how the fraction of odd spreads depends on the average value of the spread for each stock .    .",
    "in the inset we plot a further average over a period of 80 days.,height=226 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.1 ] we have plotted , for each stock , the daily fraction of odd - valued spreads as a function of the average value of the spread .",
    "there are 80 different points for each stock and also a further average over all the days is plotted in the inset .",
    "we can observe that for almost all points the fraction of odd - valued spreads is larger than @xmath1 which would be the expected value if the spread was very large ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this asymmetry is more marked for stocks with a smaller average spread and it goes diminishing while the average spread increases .",
    "a small average spread usually corresponds to stocks with a large capitalization . in the next sections we are going to investigate these results in the framework of the model we have introduced in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "in this section we propose a simple explanation of the evidences shown in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] on the basis of the order book model introduced in  @xcite . + first of all we briefly recall the main properties of the model . at each time",
    "step an order is placed .",
    "this order can be a sell or a buy order with the same probability @xmath3 , and a market or a limit order with probability @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "a limit order is placed with an uniform distribution in the interval @xmath6b(t ) , b(t)+k s(t)]$ ] if it is a sell order and @xmath7 if it is a buy order , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the best bid and the best ask respectively , @xmath10 is the spread and @xmath11 is a constant . in first approximation",
    "@xmath12 is the probability for a limit order to be put inside the spread ( therefore causing a price change ) .",
    "this dependence on the previous spread value creates a sort of autoregressive mechanism for the order deposition . the tick size and the volume of the orders are both constant and fixed ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "finally , a cancellation process avoids the divergence of the volume stored in the order book .",
    "+ in this framework we can evaluate a number of quantities , for example the probability that , given a spread @xmath0 at time @xmath15 , the new spread @xmath16 at time @xmath17 is even or odd , where @xmath18 is the time to wait to have a variation of the spread .",
    "the dependence on the parameter @xmath19 is removed because we consider only the conditioned probability that an event occurs . in this paper",
    "we indicate with @xmath0 the value of the spread before an incoming event and with @xmath20 the new value of the spread consequent to the variation . here",
    "we restrict our analysis only to events due to limit order arrival .",
    "the probability to have an odd spread in the final state turns to be dependent on the parity of the spread @xmath0 .",
    "straightforward calculations give the probabilities @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote if the the spread is odd or even respectively .",
    "one can see that @xmath24 : given an even spread @xmath0 in the initial state , the next spread @xmath20 has a larger probability to be odd rather than even .",
    "as expected , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 tend to @xmath3 for @xmath27 .",
    "this simple argument gives a first explanation of the empirical evidence of an excess of odd spreads shown in the previous section .",
    "now we intend to give an interpretation of fig .",
    "[ fig:1.1 ] in view of the results obtained in the previous section .",
    "the dispersion of the points plotted in fig .  [ fig:1.1 ] can be traced back to the spurious effect introduced by the fact that many different spreads @xmath0 give their contribution to the final average .",
    "therefore the next step is to investigate the frequency of odd spreads conditioned to a given @xmath0 , in order to compare eq .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] to real data .",
    "+ we can identify the variations of the spread caused by limit orders imposing the condition @xmath28 because only limit orders inside the spread can decrease its value ( the same argument has been also followed , for example , by @xcite ) .",
    "given an initial spread @xmath0 for real data .",
    "the plot shows clearly that with high probability an odd spread is followed by an even one ( @xmath29 ) and vice - versa.,height=226 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.1 ] we show the conditional probability to have an odd spread @xmath20 starting from a spread @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the pattern strongly oscillates around the value @xmath3 : an even spread is most likely followed by an odd one as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] , but surprisingly also the viceversa is true . + this apparently strange ( with respect to the result of eq .",
    "[ ashgdjs ] ) behavior can be attributed to a non - uniform depositions of limit orders inside the spread .",
    "we studied the distribution of the spread variations conditioned to a given value of the spread @xmath0 for real data .",
    "we found that a consistent fraction @xmath30 of the limit orders inside the spread is placed at the quote adjacent to the best , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.2 ] .     of the spread",
    "given an initial @xmath0 for different spread values ( empirical data ) .",
    "the most probable variation is always @xmath31 .",
    "the probabilities of the other variations ( @xmath32 ) are weakly decreasing functions and , in first approximation , can be considered as constant .",
    "the dashed line is the power law with exponent @xmath33 found in @xcite for london stock exhange . in both cases",
    "@xmath31 is highly preferred.,height=226 ]    a reasonable way to model this non - uniform distribution of the limit orders inside the spread is through a piecewise constant function . in this way",
    "the probability to put a limit order at the first adjacent quote is @xmath34 , and the probability to put the order in one of the other remaining quotes is equally distributed .",
    "this tendency can be also interpreted in terms of agents strategies .",
    "in fact , the placement an order far from the ( previous ) best bid or ask can be seen as a risky operation in which the agent , by disagreeing with other agents evaluations , tries to trade quickly paying a kind of virtual cost equal to the distance between the best and her order quote . in other words , an order near the best is the most conservative position able to change the spread .     to place an order at the quote adjacent to the best one as a function of the spread .",
    "we have plotted this probabilities for three representative stocks and also an average over all the 20 stocks .",
    "the very different values observed can be explained by considering the different statistics of the stocks . to properly address this effect",
    "we have performed an average over the 20 stocks of our data set .",
    "the result is a value of @xmath35 approximately constant.,height=226 ]    the next step is to find how much the probability @xmath34 to place a limit order near the corresponding best depends on the spread @xmath0 and on the stock considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.3 ] we plot @xmath34 as a function of @xmath0 for three stocks which cover a wide range of capitalization , finding very different behaviors depending on the stocks and on the values of the spreads .",
    "one possible explaination for this variety of behaviors is the lack of statistics : in fact , liquid stocks ( that is , stocks characterized by fast order execution and small transaction impact on the price ) usually have small spreads , and hence the statistics for large spreads is poor , and viceversa for illiquid stocks .",
    "we can appropriately weight the contribution of different stocks by averaging on all the data .",
    "the resulting curve is approximately a constant as a function of the spread .",
    "in the previous section we have observed a systematic deviation of the experimental probabilities @xmath36 and @xmath37 from the ones of eq .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] derived from the hypothesis of uniform order deposition . in this section we are going to show that this discrepancy is mainly due to the non - uniform probability of order placement inside the spread , and therefore to agents strategies .",
    "+ in order to include the effect of a non - uniform order deposition , we can generalize eq .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] in the following way @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the probability mass function of the deposition mechanism for limit orders inside the spread and @xmath40 is the distance from the best quote of the placement price .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.3 ] we have seen that the probability @xmath34 that a limit order produces a spread variation equal to one is weakly dependent on the value of the spread .",
    "this suggests a simple approximation for @xmath39 with a piecewise function .",
    "now we discuss how to introduce this property in our model .",
    "+ if a limit order falls inside the book or at the best quotes the mechanism for order deposition is left unchanged . instead , if a limit order is placed inside the spread , the probabilities associated to the @xmath41 available quotes are no more uniform but highly peaked around the quote adjacent to the best .",
    "the deposition probabilities for a buy or a sell order , for a given @xmath0 , become @xmath42 for buy orders the index @xmath43 is the distance from the best bid while for sell orders the index @xmath43 is the distance from the best ask . in the previous section",
    "we have seen that in real markets @xmath34 can be approximately considered as constant and its value is about @xmath44 .",
    "clearly eq .",
    "[ eq:5.2 ] is meaningful only for @xmath45 since for @xmath46 limit orders can not fall inside the spread and for @xmath47 a limit order inside the spread is always placed at the quote adjacent to the best one .",
    "+ it follows directly from eq .",
    "[ eq:5.2 ] that the transition probabilities now read @xmath48 + in fig .",
    "[ fig:5.1 ] we plot a comparison between the expression of eq .",
    "[ eq:5.3 ] and the corresponding probabilities evaluated from our data set .",
    "the experimental results are obtained by averaging over all the @xmath49 trading days and over all the @xmath50 stocks .",
    "the oscillating behavior can be explained by considering that a variation of spread of one tick ( @xmath51 ) is highly preferred with respect to other variations .",
    "hence an odd spread goes more likely to an even one and vice - versa .",
    ".,height=226 ]    we are now able to separate the two effects that contribute to enhance the fraction of odd spreads and produce the pattern of fig .",
    "[ fig:1.1 ] through a simple monte carlo simulation .",
    "these two contributions are the intrinsic asymmetry due to discreteness and non - uniformity of order deposition .",
    "as initial conditions we generate some sequences of spreads with different means , in order to represent different virtual stocks . starting from each sequence",
    "we simulate the transition to odd or even spreads @xmath20 according to the probabilities of eq .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq:5.3 ] .",
    "in such a way we can evaluate the average fraction of odd spreads for each virtual stock . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5.4 ] we compare the empirical average asymmetry with the results of the monte carlo simulations in the two cases just mentioned .",
    "the intrinsic asymmetry alone is not able to fit properly the experimental data which instead are well reproduced by considering the two combined effects .",
    "nevertheless we can observe some deviations for large spreads ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have assumed a constant probability to place order at quotes different from the one adjacent to the best .",
    "when the spread grows the error introduced by this assumption becomes larger .",
    ".,height=226 ]    it is worth noticing that here we are neglecting the correlations between the spread values .",
    "anyway we can recover the experimental behavior even with this uncorrelated sequence since we are averaging on times far longer than the time scales of the spread correlation .",
    "an interesting question concerns the role of the parameter @xmath34 and how the non - uniform deposition inside the spread affects the order book statistical properties .",
    "our model allows this kind of investigation and permits to study the effect of different strategies of order placement inside the spread . +",
    "a numerical simulation reveals that if the same set of parameters of sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and of  @xcite is used , the spread dynamics diverges for @xmath53 . to explain this effect we have to consider the interplay between market and limit orders .",
    "market orders tend to move away the two best quotes eroding the book .",
    "instead limit orders tend to reduce the spread by coupling the processes followed by best ask and best bid .",
    "in such a way the process for the spread is somehow stationary . in this framework",
    "the deposition rules play an important role in softening or strengthening the coupling action of limit orders .",

    "we want to stress that a small volatility clustering is already present in the uniform case .",
    "its origin can be traced back to the dependence on the past spread values of the deposition mechanism .",
    "this simple effect introduces an exponential correlation and so fixes a characteristic time - scale .",

    "[ fig:6.2 ] a , b that , in order to make the system stable with respect to @xmath34 , a possible solution is the reduction of the probability of market orders @xmath65 . in such a way it is possible to increase the average length of limit order sequences and then to compensate the lower coupling .",
