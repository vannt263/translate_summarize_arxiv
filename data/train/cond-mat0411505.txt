    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a driven diffusive system of particles on a lattice interacting through hard - core exclusion , that serves as a basic model in various fields ranging from protein synthesis to traffic flow ( for a recent review , see schtz 2001 ) . in non - equilibrium",
    "statistical physics , the asep plays the role of a paradigm thanks to the variety of phenomenological behavior it displays and to the number of exact results it has led to in the last decade ( see , _ e.g. _ , derrida 1998 ) . in particular",
    ", asep is an integrable model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the markov matrix that encodes its stochastic dynamics can be diagonalized by bethe ansatz , as first noticed by dhar ( 1987 ) .",
    "thus , the spectral gap of the markov matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , the difference between the two eigenvalues with largest real parts , that characterizes the longest relaxation time of the system , can be calculated exactly : this was first done for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) at half filling ( gwa and spohn 1992 ) and later , using a mapping into the six vertex model , kim ( 1995 ) treated the case of the general asep at arbitrary filling . in both works , the calculations are complicated though the final result for the gap is fairly simple . in a recent work ( golinelli and mallick 2004 )",
    ", we presented a concise derivation of the tasep gap at half filling that circumvents most of the technical difficulties thanks to an analytic continuation formula .",
    "however , the half filling condition seemed to play a crucial role in our derivation ( as well as in the calculation of gwa and spohn ) .",
    "our aim in the present work is to show that our method can be extended to the arbitrary filling case .",
    "we shall study the tasep on a periodic one - dimensional lattice with @xmath0 sites ( sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 are identical ) .",
    "the tasep is a discrete lattice gas model on which each lattice site @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) is either empty or occupied by one particle ( _ exclusion rule _ ) .",
    "particles evolve according to stochastic dynamical rules : a particle on a site @xmath2 at time @xmath5 jumps , in the interval between times @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with probability @xmath7 to the neighbouring site @xmath8 if this site is empty . as the system is periodic , the total number @xmath1 of particles is conserved and the density ( or filling ) is given by @xmath9",
    ". a configuration of the tasep can be characterized by the positions of the @xmath1 particles on the ring , @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 represents the probability of this configuration at time @xmath5 , the evolution of @xmath13 is given by the master equation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the markov matrix .",
    "a right eigenvector @xmath16 is associated with the eigenvalue @xmath17 of @xmath15 if @xmath18 .",
    "thanks to the perron - frobenius theorem , we know that the zero - eigenvalue of @xmath15 , which corresponds to the stationary state , is non - degenerate and that all the other eigenvalues of @xmath15 have a strictly negative real part . in the stationary state ,",
    "all configurations have the same probability , given by @xmath19 .    in the next section",
    ", we present the bethe ansatz equations and restate them as a single self - consistency equation .",
    "we then calculate the tasep spectral gap as a function of the density @xmath20 in the limit of a large system size , @xmath21 ( section 3 ) .",
    "the _ bethe ansatz _ assumes that the eigenvectors @xmath16 of @xmath15 can be written in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the group of the @xmath24 permutations of @xmath1 indexes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath25 and the wave - numbers @xmath26 are complex numbers determined by the _ bethe equations_. in terms of the fugacity variables @xmath27 , these equations become ( gwa and spohn 1992 ) @xmath28 we note that the right - hand side of these equations is independent of the index @xmath2 : this property is true only for the _ totally _ asymmetric exclusion process and not for the partially asymmetric exclusion process where the particles can also jump backwards . introducing an auxiliary complex variable @xmath29 , the bethe equations  ( [ eq : bez ] ) can be reformulated as explained below ( for more details , see gwa and spohn 1992 ; golinelli and mallick 2004 ) .",
    "consider the one variable polynomial equation of degree @xmath0 , @xmath30 and call @xmath31 the @xmath0 roots of this equation .",
    "for a given value of @xmath29 , the complex numbers @xmath31 belong to a generalized cassini oval defined by the equation @xmath32 @xmath20 being the density of the system .",
    "the topology of the cassini oval depends on the value of @xmath33 ( see the figure ) . defining @xmath34",
    "we find that for @xmath35 , the locus of the @xmath36 s consists of two disjoint ovals , with the roots @xmath37 belonging to the oval on the right and the roots @xmath38 to the oval on the left .",
    "for @xmath39 , the cassini oval is a deformed lemniscate of bernoulli with a double point at @xmath40 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the oval is made of a single loop .",
    "the labelling of the @xmath0 roots @xmath42 is shown in the figure .    .",
    "here @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( the filling is @xmath45 ) with @xmath46 for @xmath47 ; curves are drawn for @xmath48 ( blue ) , @xmath49 ( black ) and @xmath50 ( red ) .",
    "see text for more explanations . _ ]    we now introduce a monotonous function @xmath51 that selects @xmath1 fugacities among the @xmath0 roots @xmath42 . defining the function @xmath52 as @xmath53 the bethe equations become equivalent to the _ self - consistency _ equation @xmath54 given the choice function @xmath55 and a solution @xmath29 of this equation , the @xmath56 s are determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zpoly ] ) and the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath57 is given by @xmath58    the choice function @xmath59 that selects the @xmath1 fugacities @xmath60 with the largest real parts provides the ground state of the markov matrix .",
    "the associated @xmath61-function and eigenvalue are given by @xmath62 the equation @xmath63 has the unique solution @xmath64 that yields @xmath65 for @xmath66 and provides the ground state with eigenvalue @xmath67 .",
    "we shall also need the following formula in the sequel : @xmath68 to derive this identity , we raise equation  ( [ eq : a0 ] ) to the @xmath1-th power , use equation  ( [ eq : zpoly ] ) and take the logarithm of the result ; however an additional term , which is a discrete constant ( a multiple of @xmath69 ) appears in the calculations .",
    "this constant vanishes identically because both terms in equation  ( [ eq : lna0 ] ) become real numbers in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "the spectral gap , given by the first excited eigenvalue , corresponds to the choice @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( gwa and spohn 1992 ) .",
    "the associated self - consistency function and eigenvalue are given by ( using equations  ( [ eq : ac ] , [ eq : ez]-[eq : e0 ] ) ) @xmath74 thus , from equation  ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , the self - consistency equation that determines the gap reads @xmath75    the excitation corresponding to the choice function @xmath76 for @xmath72 and @xmath77 , leads to the complex - conjugate eigenvalue @xmath78 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath79 corresponding to the first excited state is obtained by solving the self - consistency equation @xmath80 where @xmath81 is defined in equation  ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",
    "we shall solve this equation in the limit @xmath82 , keeping @xmath83 constant .",
    "as in ( golinelli and mallick 2004 ) , we start with the taylor expansions , of @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the vicinity of @xmath64 and valid for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in our previous work , we considered only the half - filling case , @xmath86 , for which the polynomial equation  ( [ eq : zpoly ] ) reduces to @xmath87 and can be solved _",
    "explicitly _ in terms of y yielding the taylor series of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "an explicit solution of equation  ( [ eq : zpoly ] ) can not , however , be obtained for an arbitrary density @xmath20 .",
    "this major technical difficulty can be circumvented thanks to a contour integral representation similar to that used for calculating large deviation functions ( derrida and lebowitz 1998 ; derrida and appert 1999 ; derrida and evans 1999 ) .    when @xmath90 , the @xmath1 roots @xmath91 of equation  ( [ eq : zpoly ] ) with the largest real parts converge to + 1 , whereas the @xmath92 remaining roots converge to -1 .",
    "we now consider a positively oriented contour @xmath93 that encircles + 1 such that for sufficiently small values of @xmath29 the roots @xmath91 lie inside @xmath93 and @xmath94 are outside @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath95 be a function that is analytic in a domain containing the contour @xmath93 .",
    "we also define @xmath96 because , by definition , the @xmath97 are the zeroes of @xmath98 , we obtain , from the residues theorem , @xmath99 expanding the denominator in the contour integral for small values of @xmath29 ( thanks to the formula @xmath100 valid for @xmath101 ) , we obtain the taylor expansion @xmath102 the second equality is derived by integrating by parts the terms with @xmath103 ; the term @xmath104 in the third equality is obtained from the residues theorem",
    ". we shall need the following identity , valid for any positive integers @xmath105 and @xmath106 : @xmath107    using equation  ( [ eq : taylorh ] ) with @xmath108 , we obtain from equations  ( [ eq : lna0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ident ] ) @xmath109 similarly , using equation  ( [ eq : taylorh ] ) with @xmath110 , we obtain from equations  ( [ eq : e0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ident ] ) @xmath111    in the limit @xmath21 and with @xmath20 fixed , we obtain from the stirling formula @xmath112 where @xmath113 was defined in equation  ( [ eq : rc ] ) and the _ polylogarithm _ function of index @xmath114 , @xmath115 , is given by @xmath116 the function @xmath115 is defined by the first equality on the whole complex plane with a branch cut along the real semi - axis @xmath117 ; the second equality is valid only for @xmath118 .",
    "the limit found in equation  ( [ eq : lhsa1 ] ) suggests that @xmath29 can be parameterized as follows : @xmath119 @xmath120 being a complex number with @xmath121 and which remains finite in the limit @xmath122 .",
    "thus @xmath123 and roots of the type @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a fixed positive integer are close to the lemniscate double - point @xmath40 .",
    "writing @xmath128 , with @xmath129 , and taking the logarithm of equation  ( [ eq : bez ] ) we obtain @xmath130 for fixed @xmath127 , the values @xmath131 lead to @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and @xmath134 lead to @xmath124 and @xmath135 . neglecting terms of order @xmath136",
    ", we have @xmath137 @xmath138 substituting equations  ( [ eq : lhsa1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : devzn ] ) and  ( [ eq : devznp1 ] ) in equation  ( [ eq : sca1 ] ) , we obtain the large @xmath0 limit of the bethe equations for the gap which , at the leading order , reads as @xmath139 .",
    "\\label{eq : li32}\\ ] ] this equation is the same as that obtained in ( golinelli and mallick 2004 ) and its solution is given by : @xmath140 we can now calculate the eigenvalue corresponding to the first excited state .",
    "> from equations  ( [ eq : e1e0 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : sca1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : taylore0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath141 @xmath142    the large @xmath0 limit of this expression is found by using the stirling formula , the expansions  ( [ eq : devzn ] ) and ( [ eq : devznp1 ] ) , and the parameterization of @xmath29 given by equation  ( [ eq : u ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath143 \\right )           \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{4 i \\pi } { l } ( 1 -   2 \\rho ) \\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the solution of the equation  ( [ eq : li32 ] ) , its numerical value being given in equation  ( [ eq : solu ] ) . comparing with the value @xmath144 obtained at half - filling",
    "we conclude that @xmath145 this equation agrees with the one derived by kim ( 1995 ) .",
    "we notice that this eigenvalue has a non - vanishing imaginary part when the density is different from one half .",
    "the asymmetric exclusion process can be mapped into the six vertex model and is thus an integrable model that can be solved by bethe ansatz .",
    "kim ( 1995 ) has used this technique to calculate gaps and crossover functions for the generic asymmetric exclusion process but the calculations are very complicated . however , for the totally asymmetric exclusion process the bethe equations can be reduced to a single polynomial equation and their analysis becomes much simpler as shown in the present work .",
    "we have calculated the gap of the tasep for arbitrary filling .",
    "our method is closely related to that used to calculate large deviation functions ( see derrida 1998 , for a review ) and leads to derivations that are far simpler than the ones presented in previous works .",
