    "the so - called recycling scenario links two different classes of astronomical objects , namely the millisecond radio pulsars ( usually found in binary systems ) and the low mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter lmxbs ) , or , at least , a subgroup of them . the leading idea of this scenario is the recycling process itself , during which an old , weakly magnetized , slowly spinning neutron star is accelerated by the accretion of matter and angular momentum from a ( keplerian ) accretion disk down to spin periods in the millisecond range . in this way , at the end of the accretion phase , the neutron star rotates so fast that it is resurrected from the radio pulsar graveyard , allowing the radio pulsar phenomenon to occur again despite the weakness of the magnetic field .",
    "although this scenario was first proposed long ago ( see e.g. bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 for a review ) , the most embarassing problem was the absence of coherent pulsations in lmxbs .",
    "only recently , the long seeked millisecond coherent oscillations in lmxbs have been found , thanks to the capabilities ( the right combination of high temporal resolution and large collecting area ) of the rxte satellite . in april 1998 , a transient lmxb , , was discovered to harbour a millisecond pulsar ( @xmath0  ms ) in a compact ( @xmath1  h ) binary system ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "we now know seven accreting millisecond pulsars ( wijnands 2005 ; morgan et al .",
    "2005 ) ; all of them are x - ray transients in very compact systems ( orbital period between 40 min and 4 h ) , the fastest of which ( @xmath2  ms ) , , has been discovered in december 2004 ( galloway et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter g05 ) .",
    "timing techniques applied to data of various accreting millisecond pulsars , spanning the first few days of their outbursts , allowed an accurate determination of their main orbital parameters .",
    "however , only a few attempts have been made to determine the spin period derivative ( chakrabarty et al.2003 ; galloway et al .",
    "the first reported measurement of a spin - up in these sources was made for igr j00291 + 5934 ( falanga et al .",
    "2005 , f05 ) .",
    "in this paper we apply an accurate timing technique to the fastest currently known accreting millisecond pulsar , , with the aim of constraining the predictions of different torque models with good quality experimental data .",
    "our results indicate quite clearly that a net spin up occurred during the december 2004 outburst of  ( see also f05 ) and that the derived torque is in good agreement with that expected from matter accreting from a keplerian disk .",
    "for a periodic pulsating source , the time of arrival of a given pulse at the solar system baricentre is affected by three effects which causes temporal delays with respect to the predicted ones .",
    "these effects are 1 ) uncertainties in the orbital parameters , 2 ) uncertainty in the spin frequency and possible secular variations , 3 ) uncertainties in the source position . in standard timing techniques ( see e.g.  blandford & teukolsky 1976 ) the predicted arrival time of a given pulse is computed using a first guess of the parameters of the system , and the difference between the experimental and predicted arrival times , namely the residuals , are fitted with a linear multiple regression of the differential corrections to the parameters .",
    "this means that the differential correction to orbital parameters , spin frequency and its derivative , source position in the sky , are computed simultaneously .",
    "this technique has the obvious advantage to give a self - consistent solution , where all the correlations in the covariance matrix of the system are fully taken into account .",
    "however , the convergence of the fit is not always guaranteed and  especially in the case of long temporal baselines - convergence to secondary minima might lead to inaccurate solutions .    on the other hand , if the orbital period is much shorter than the timescale on which the spin period derivative and the source position uncertainty are expected to produce a significant effect , it is easy to see that the delays in the arrival times produced by the uncertainties in the orbital parameters are distinguishable from those caused by the other two effects .",
    "this is because the former oscillate on the orbital period timescale , while it is expected that the latter will follow a secular trend dictated by the torques on the accreting neutron star and by the orbital motion of earth . in the following",
    "we therefore discuss all these effects separately and describe in general the timing analysis suitable for these cases .",
    "the procedure we applied is the following . in order to obtain the emission times , @xmath3 , the arrival times of all the events , @xmath4 ,",
    "were firstly reported to the solar system barycenter adopting the best estimate of the source position in the sky .",
    "we note here that the contribution of the relative acceleration of the binary system with respect to the solar system could in principle produce not negligible contribution to the frequency derivative . for a source located at the position of  at a distance of few kpc ,",
    "the most relevant of these effects is due to the planar acceleration along the galactic plane , which gives a spin derivative @xmath5 ( see e.g.  damour & taylor 1991 ) .",
    "this is several orders of magnitude lower than the spin frequency derivatives we found ( see below ) , and therefore in the following these kind of effects are not taken into account .",
    "then we corrected for the delays caused by the binary motion using the best estimate of the orbital parameters through the ( first order approximated ) formula : @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the projected semimajor axis in light seconds , @xmath8 is the mean anomaly , @xmath9 is the time of ascending node passage at the beginning of the observation , @xmath10 is the periastron angle , and @xmath11 the eccentricity . in the following , for simplicity , we use @xmath12 instead of @xmath13 . from eq .",

    "in general , fitting these expected phase variations to the observed ones , we can obtain an estimate of @xmath20 and hence important information on the torques acting on the accreting neutron star .    to obtain these information is important to evaluate any source of error in the observed phase variations ; we start discussing the errors induced by the uncertainties on the orbital parameters of the binary system .",
    "the differential of @xmath14 , with @xmath12 given by expression  ( [ eq : corr ] ) , with respect to the orbital parameters allows to calculate the uncertainties in the phases , @xmath21 , caused by the uncertainties , @xmath22 , in the estimates of the orbital parameters : @xmath23 + \\sin^2 m \\ ; \\cos^2 m \\ ; \\sigma_{e}^2 \\right\\}^{1/2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the uncertainties in the adopted orbital parameters will result in a `` timing noise '' of amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "these should be therefore added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties @xmath24 on the experimentally determined phase delays .",
    "the resulting uncertainties on the phase delays will be : @xmath25 .",
    "on the other hand , the uncertainties in the phase delays , @xmath26 , caused by the uncertainties on the estimates of the source position in the sky , will produce a sinusoidal oscillation on the earth orbital period . for observation times shorter than one year ,",
    "as it is the case for most transient accreting millisecond pulsars , this can cause systematic errors on the determination of the neutron star period and its derivative , since a series expansion of a sinusoid contains a linear and a quadratic term . in order to evaluate these effects ,",
    "let us consider the expression of the phase delays induced by the earth motion for a small displacement , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in the position of the source in ecliptic coordinates , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see e.g.  lyne & graham - smith 1990 ) : @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the distance of the earth with respect to the solar system barycenter in light seconds , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the time of passage through the vernal point , and @xmath35 in our case .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations , this can be written as : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the positional error circle , @xmath38 , and @xmath39^{1/2 } / \\sigma_\\gamma$ ] .",
    "since the true source position must lie within the error circle , the following inequalities hold : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and thus @xmath42 .",
    "this means that the uncertainty in the source position is : @xmath43 we can expand it in series in the parameter @xmath44 in order to find the systematic uncertainties induced on the linear and quadratic term .",
    "note that , since the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the differences between the nominal and the true ( unknown ) source position ( which can be everywhere within the error circle ) , their ratio is undetermined , and hence @xmath45 can be any value between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we have therefore maximized the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 separately in the linear and quadratic terms of the series expansion . the resulting systematic error in the linear and the quadratic term of phase delays evolution versus time , which correspond to the spin frequency correction and the spin frequency derivative , respectively ,",
    "are : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    summarizing ,",
    "the phase variations caused by @xmath18 are effectively distinguishable from those induced by the uncertainties in the orbital parameters , which result in a `` timing noise '' of amplitude given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : orbdel ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainty on the source position can not be easily decoupled from the phase variations caused by @xmath18 ( particularly for observation times much shorter than one year ) , and therefore results in systematic errors on the estimate of the spin frequency and its derivative .",
    "was observed by rxte between 2004 december 3 and 21 .",
    "while the observations between december 3 and 6 were already analyzed in g05 , in this paper we analyze the data between december 7 and 21 taken from a public too .",
    "we mainly use data from the rxte proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) , which consists of five identical gas - filled proportional counter units ( pcus ) , with a total effective area of @xmath53 @xmath54 , sensitive in the energy range between 2 and 60 kev .",

    "these files were processed and analyzed using the ftools v.5.3.1 . in order to eliminate the doppler effects caused by the earth and satellite motion ,",
    "the arrival times of all the events were converted to barycentric dynamical times at the solar system barycenter .",
    "the position adopted for the source was that of the proposed radio counterpart ( which is compatible with that of the proposed optical counterpart , see rupen et al.2004 ; fox & kulkarni 2004 ) .",
    "for the spectral analysis we also used data from the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte , rothschild et al .",
    "1998 , @xmath56 kev energy range ) .",
    "we corrected the arrival times of all the events for the delays caused by the binary motion using eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) with the orbital parameters given in g05 . in order to check for the presence of the pulsations during our observation",
    ", we performed an epoch folding search on each continuous interval of data ( lasting on average 60 min ) around the spin period given in g05 .",
    "the pulsation was clearly visible up to december 12 .",
    "after that , owing to poor statistics , pulsations could be detected only by folding @xmath57  day worth of data .",
    "no pulsations were detected after december 14 , in accordance to what reported in g05 .    using our longer temporal baseline ( about 7 days ) with respect to that in g05 ( about 3 days )",
    ", we firstly tried to increase the accuracy of the orbital period measurement using the technique described in papitto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and successfully applied to .",
    "however , no significant improvement was found . adopting the uncertainties in the estimates of the orbital parameters given in g05 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : orbdel ] ) , we obtain : @xmath58 , where we have maximized @xmath59 and @xmath60 functions with 1 , and used @xmath61 days .",
    "therefore , we expect that the uncertainties in the orbital parameters will cause a `` timing noise '' not greater than @xmath62  ms .    to compute phases of good statistical significance we epoch folded each interval of data in which the pulsation was significantly detected at the spin period given in g05 with respect to the same reference epoch , @xmath16 , corresponding to the beginning of our observations .",
    "the fractional part of the phase was obtained fitting each pulse profile with a sinusoid of fixed period . to compute the associated errors we combined the statistical errors derived from the fit , @xmath24 , with the errors @xmath63 as @xmath64 .    in order to derive the differential correction to the spin frequency , @xmath65 , and its derivative , @xmath66",
    ", at the time @xmath16 we have to derive a functional form for the time dependence of the phase delays .",
    "we started from the simple assumptions briefly summarized below : i ) the bolometric luminosity @xmath67 is a good tracer of the mass accretion rate @xmath68 _ via _ the relation @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the gravitational constant and the neutron star mass and radius , respectively .",
    "ii ) the matter accretes through a keplerian disk truncated at the magnetospheric radius , @xmath74 , by its interaction with the ( dipolar ) magnetic field of the neutron star . at @xmath75",
    "the matter is forced to corotate with the magnetic field of the neutron star and is funneled ( at least in part ) towards the rotating magnetic poles , thus causing the pulsed emission . for standard disk accretion @xmath76 ; note that this is very close to the upper limit @xmath77 derived from our data .",
    "this upper limit on @xmath78 can be derived noting that the pulsations were clearly seen at the beginning of the observations in g05 at mjd@xmath79 , and were detected for @xmath80 days until mjd@xmath81 , when the flux reduced by a factor of @xmath82",
    ". the corresponding expansion in @xmath75 must be @xmath83 which , for @xmath84 cm and @xmath85 , gives @xmath86 where @xmath87 days is the decay time from g05 and @xmath88 is the corotation radius , both defined below .",
    "therefore we considered two extreme cases , namely @xmath89 and @xmath90 , since a location of @xmath75 independent of @xmath68 has been proposed ( see , _ e.g. _ , rappaport , fregeau , and spruit , 2004 ) .",
    "iii ) the matter accretes onto the neutron star its specific keplerian angular momentum at @xmath75 , @xmath91 , thus causing a material torque @xmath92 . a firm upper limit to this torque",
    "is given by the condition @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the corotation radius ( namely the radius at which the keplerian frequency equals @xmath96 and beyond which accretion is centrifugally inhibited ) , and @xmath97 .",
    "iv ) we _ do not consider _ any form of threading of the accretion disk by the magnetic field of the neutron star ( see e.g.  ghosh & lamb 1979 ; wang 1997 ; wang 1996 ; rappaport , fregeau , and spruit 2004 for a description of the magnetic threading ) , which implies that the only torque acting during accretion is @xmath98 .    under these hypotheses",
    "the spin frequency derivative is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star and we have neglected any variation of @xmath100 caused by accretion .",
    "if @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 , where @xmath103 , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are @xmath75 and @xmath68 at @xmath106 , respectively . for the @xmath90 case we assumed @xmath107",
    "in this case we therefore assume that the system is accreting the maximum specific angular momentum possible , giving an upper limit on the spin - up torque and therefore a lower limit to the accretion rate @xmath105 .    since we assumed @xmath108 , to determine the temporal dependence of @xmath109 we studied the energy spectra of the source for each continuous interval of data combining pca and hexte data .",
    "all the spectra are well fitted with a model consisting of a power law with an exponential cutoff plus thermal emission from a keplerian accretion disk modified by photoelectric absorption and a gaussian iron line . in order to derive @xmath110 for each spectrum we made the simple assumption @xmath111 , which is the unabsorbed flux in the rxte pca plus hexte energy band @xmath112 kev . a good fit of @xmath113 _ vs _ @xmath12 between december 7 and 14 ( @xmath114 days ) is given by the expression @xmath115 $ ] with @xmath116 days , where @xmath117 is the unabsorbed flux at @xmath118 .",

    "we have therefore fitted these phases with the function : @xmath126 .",

    "the new phases were fitted with eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) . in this case , @xmath65 was fully compatible with zero . these phases are plotted versus time in figure  [ fig1 ] ( upper panel ) together with the residuals in units of @xmath22 with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) ( lower panel ) .",
    "the best fit estimates of @xmath127 and @xmath66 are reported in table  [ table1 ] for three values of @xmath78 , namely @xmath90 which correspond to a location of @xmath75 independent of the accretion rate ( cfr .",

    "of course , the value of @xmath18 obtained in this latter case is in agreement with the value obtained by f05 of @xmath130 hz s@xmath131 .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath132dof for each of the adopted values of @xmath78 ( also reported in table  [ table1 ] ) shows that the statistics is not good enough to distinguish between these three possibilities .",
    "finally , to evaluate the systematic errors on the spin frequency and its derivative , we adopted the positional uncertainty of @xmath133 radius reported by rupen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in a series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : posdel2 ] ) , finding @xmath134 hz and @xmath135 hz / s , respectively . even adopting a positional error circle of @xmath136 ( which is the distance between the optical and radio position , fox & kulkarni 2004 ) ,",
    "the resulting systematic uncertainties are @xmath137 hz and @xmath138 hz / s .",
    "note that the systematic error on the spin frequency is comparable with the error derived from the fit of the phase delays and reported in table  1 , the systematic error on the spin frequency derivative is at least one order of magnitude below the error derived from the fit .",
    "from the best - fit value of the spin frequency derivative @xmath66 we can compute the mass accretion rate at @xmath106 through the formula : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is @xmath105 in units of @xmath141 yr@xmath131 , @xmath142 is @xmath66 in units of @xmath143 s@xmath144 , and @xmath145 is @xmath100 in units of @xmath146 g @xmath54 . in the following we will adopt the fps equation of state for the neutron star matter for @xmath147 and the spin frequency of  which gives @xmath148 and @xmath149 cm ( see e.g.  cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) .",
    "this gives a lower limit in the mass accretion rate of @xmath150 ( case @xmath90 ) . in order to compare the experimental estimate of @xmath105 with the observed x - ray luminosity",
    ", we have to derive the bolometric luminosity @xmath110 from the observed flux @xmath113 .",
    "to this end we consider the spectral shape at @xmath118 in more detail .    since the value of the hydrogen column @xmath151 is poorly constrained in the rxte energy band which starts at 2.5 kev , we fixed it to @xmath152 cm@xmath144 , which is the value obtained by nowak et al .",
    "( 2004 ) analysing chandra data .",
    "our spectral results are practically independent of the precise value of the @xmath151 below the total galactic hydrogen column in the direction of .",
    "the power law is the dominant spectral component .",
    "in particular we found a power law spectral index @xmath154 and an @xmath11-folding energy @xmath155 kev ( with values ranging from @xmath156 to over @xmath157 kev throughout our data ) .",
    "the ratio of the unabsorbed fluxes in the bands @xmath158 kev and @xmath159 kev is @xmath160 .",
    "this ratio is almost independent on the @xmath11-folding energy , increasing up to @xmath161 when the @xmath11-folding energy increases from 60 to 260 kev .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath162 .",
    "the power - law component presumably originates in regions of small optical depth just above each polar cap ( see e.g.  poutanen & gierlinski 2003 ; gierlinski & poutanen 2005 ) , thus we neglect , to first order , any effect of the inclination of the emitting region with respect to the observer . on the other hand",
    ", we observe a single - peaked pulse profile , which means that we only see the emission from one of these regions ( e.g.  kulkarni & romanova 2005 ) .",
    "if this is the case , we have to take into account the possibility that we are underestimating the total flux in the power - law component because one of the two polar caps is never visible ( this can happen if the sum of the angles between the magnetic axis and spin axis and between the line of sight and the spin axis is less than @xmath163 ) .",
    "if we only see polar cap a , we indicate with @xmath164 the flux emitted by a reaching the observer . because the emission from a is isotropic , to obtain the luminosity we have to integrate over @xmath165 , so we obtain @xmath166 .",
    "however , under our assumptions , this is an underestimate of the total ( a + b ) luminosity of the system consisting of the two polar caps , since part of the flux ( @xmath167 ) that should be emitted in the direction of the observer is never visible .",
    "actually almost half of the emission from cap a facing the neutron star surface is intercepted by the neutron star itself and re - emitted towards the observer , and this re - emission should indeed be consider . however , it is reasonable to assume that this intercepted emission is reprocessed by the neutron star and re - emitted as a blackbody - like spectrum at a relatively low temperature .",
    "this reprocessed emission has therefore a very different spectral shape from the original power - law component : simple estimates demonstrate that the temperature associated with this blackbody - like emission is below 1 kev , and thus not related to the power - law component .",
    "moreover , most of the emission from this component is outside the energy range of rxte / pca ( and thus poorly constrained by the rxte observation ) .",
    "since the emission from an optically thin region is proportional to the volume of the emitting region visible , in the hypothesis that we totally miss the flux from one of the two polar caps , we should multiply by a factor 2 the unabsorbed flux of the power law in order to take into account the emission of the optically thin region above the unseen polar cap .",
    "we therefore parametrize the luminosity of the power - law component with a factor @xmath168 ( which can assume values between 1 and 2 ) , and we can write the total luminosity of the two polar caps as : @xmath169 erg / s , where @xmath170 is the source distance in units of @xmath171 kpc .",
    "the uncertainty on the luminosity has been evaluated conservatively by propagating the uncertainties on the spectral parameters treated as they were independent of each other .",
    "the second component is the thermal emission interpreted as emission from a shakura - sunyaev accretion disk , that is fitted with the diskbb model .",
    "we found a temperature of the inner rim of the accretion disc of @xmath172 kev . on the other hand , because of the poor coverage of rxte / pca at soft x - rays , the disk blackbody normalization , @xmath173 ( where @xmath174 is the distance in units of 10 kpc ) , is basically unconstrained .",
    "we therefore use the inner disk temperature and the virial theorem to infer the bolometric luminosity of the disk , as follows .",
    "we interpret the inner temperature of the accretion disk as derived by the diskbb model as the maximum temperature in the disk .",
    "to prove this we have also fitted the soft x - ray spectrum with the diskpn model ( instead of the diskbb model ) : diskpn takes into account corrections for temperature distribution near the compact object using the paczynski - wiita pseudo - newtonian potential ( see gierlinski et al .",
    "also this model gives a maximum temperature of the disk of 0.70 kev ( fully compatible with the value obtained with the diskbb model ) .",
    "standard disc theory ( see e.g.  frank , king , & reine 2002 ) predicts that the temperature of the disk attains a maximum value at a radius of @xmath175 @xmath176 , where @xmath176 is the radius at which the disk is truncated , corresponding to @xmath177 in our case . using this in eq .  5.43 of frank , king , & reine ( 2002 ) we obtain the inner disc radius through the relation : @xmath178 km .",
    "combining this with eq .",
    "[ dotm0 ] , and adopting @xmath179 , we solve for the mass accretion rate and the inner disc radius .",
    "we found a mass accretion rate @xmath180 and an inner disc radius @xmath181 cm , that this is exactly in the very narrow range between the neutron star radius ( @xmath182 cm ) and the corotation radius ( @xmath183 cm ) ; the agreement with the expectation is compelling .",
    "the virial theorem allows to calculate the fraction of the total luminosity that is emitted by the disc : @xmath184 .",
    "therefore @xmath185 erg / s .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity is therefore @xmath186 erg / s .",
    "if we compare this luminosity with the mass accretion rate inferred from the timing analysis ( assuming an efficiency @xmath187 ) we obtain a distance to the source in the range @xmath188 kpc .",
    "note that 10 kpc is close to the edge of our galaxy in the direction of .",
    "if we push the factor @xmath168 to its maximum value of 2 , we obtain a more reasonable range of distances to the source of @xmath189 kpc , consistent with the lower limit of 5 kpc discussed in f05 .",
    "note also that the effect of including magnetic torques due to threading ( see assumption iv in ",
    "3 ) can only push the source further away .",
    "this is evident from the @xmath90 case ( which gives a spin derivative similar to the @xmath89 case discussed here ) , in which we assume that the system is accreting the specific angular momentum at the corotation radius , that is the maximum possible ; since any torque beyond the corotation could only spin down the system , this would increase the required @xmath68 to justify the measured spin - up .    finally ,",
    "using the value of the inner disc radius derived above and the normalization of the disc blackbody model , @xmath190 , we infer the inclination of the system with respect to the line of sight , which is @xmath191 for a distance of 9.5 kpc .",
    "we have analysed rxte data of the fastest known accreting millisecond pulsar , , during the period @xmath192 december , 2004 .",
    "we report a revised estimate of the spin period and discuss the spin period derivative .",
    "the source shows a strong spin - up , which indicates a mass accretion rate of about @xmath193 yr@xmath131 . we have checked that this mass accretion rate is compatible with the x - ray spectrum of the source .",
    "in particular we have shown that , with this high accretion rate , the measured temperature of the disc blackbody emission implies an inner disc radius in excellent agreement with the inferred magnetospheric radius of the source ( constrained to be in the narrow range @xmath194 cm ) and that the source is probably seen at high inclination .",
    "however , the mass accretion rate inferred by the observed spin - up ( and calculated using standard values for the neutron star moment of inertia ) , using the simple relation @xmath195 ( with an efficiency @xmath187 ) , would correspond to a quite high bolometric luminosity of the source of @xmath196 ergs / s , much higher than the observed source luminosity assuming a distance of 5 kpc .",
    "we propose that the simplest explanation of this discrepancy is that part of the accretion luminosity is not visible . indeed ,",
    "if we only see the emission of one of the two polar caps , we could miss up to half of the flux in the power - law component . under this hypothesis ( described in detail in the previous section )",
    ", we have extrapolated the flux of the source derived from the x - ray spectrum , which corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath197 erg / s . comparing this",
    "extrapolated bolometric luminosity with the mass accretion rate of the source as derived from the timing , we find an agreement between these two quantities if we place the source at a distance between 7 and 10 kpc .",
    "other possibilities to explain this discrepancy can be that part of the accretion luminosity is not observed because emitted in other energy bands or because the efficiency @xmath198 of the conversion of the gravitational potential energy of the accreting matter into x - ray luminosity is less than @xmath50 , or because of occultation effects ( which may be favoured if indeed the source is highly inclined ) . in these cases",
    "we should conclude that the observed x - ray luminosity is not a good tracer of the total mass accretion rate , @xmath68 , onto the neutron star .",
