    "such a system can exhibit  @xcite a macroscopic superconducting transition mediated by the proximity josephson coupling between the islands  @xcite , with the transition temperature @xmath8 depending on the concentration of the islands @xmath9 . above this transition electrons in the metal are normal , but andreev reflection of them from the superconducting islands leads to an additional contribution to the dephasing rate : 1/_(t ) = 1/_^(0)(t ) + 1/_^(t ) .",
