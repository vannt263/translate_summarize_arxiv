    "semiconductor quantum dots , in particular self - assembled ingaas quantum dots , are very attractive as the building blocks for quantum light sources@xcite and spin qubits@xcite .",
    "self - assembled ingaas quantum dots ( operating at wavelengths around 950 nm at low temperature ) exploit technologically advanced gaas heterostructures and have become the workhorse system in the field .",
    "it is hugely advantageous to explore the physics using resonant rather than non - resonant laser excitation . on the one hand ,",
    "non - resonant excitation introduces sources of noise resulting in exciton and spin dephasing@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "resonant ( but not non - resonant ) excitation allows a spin to be initialized@xcite , manipulated@xcite and read - out@xcite optically .",
    "resonant excitation , i.e.  coherent laser spectroscopy , on single ingaas / gaas quantum dots was first developed with differential transmission detection@xcite , using stark - shift modulation of the transitions energy along with lock - in detection for noise rejection @xcite .",
    "the detection scheme exploits an interference between the laser field and the field associated with coherently scattered photons@xcite : it provides a sensitive detection scheme but does not provide direct access to the resonance fluorescence , the single photons scattered or emitted by the quantum dot .",
    "these photons are crucial to develop a high - fidelity single photon source and , further afield , in developing a quantum dot - based quantum network with applications in quantum communication@xcite .    recently , the resonance fluorescence of a semiconductor quantum dot@xcite has been observed .",
    "the challenge experimentally is to distinguish quantum dot - scattered light from scattered laser light . with non - resonant excitation ,",
    "this separation is trivial to achieve on account of the widely different wavelengths . with resonant excitation",
    ", this scheme fails .",
    "one scheme for the detection of resonance fluorescence exploits the different wave vectors of the laser light and the resonance fluorescence@xcite .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of the original ensemble experiments in atomic physics in which resonance fluorescence was detected in a direction orthogonal to the carefully defined propagation direction of the laser@xcite . in a semiconductor context ,",
    "one implementation of this scheme involves coupling laser light to a waveguide containing quantum dots with edge illumination , detecting the resonance fluorescence in the orthogonal vertical direction@xcite .",
    "another scheme exploits a further property of light : its polarization .",
    "the idea is to operate in the dark - field as defined by the polarization : the laser and the detection are defined to have orthogonal polarization states . provided",
    "laser scattering preserves the polarization , the crossed polarizer configuration ensures that scattered laser light is prevented from entering the detection mode .",
    "success has been achieved using crossed linear polarizations@xcite .    in our experiments , we have pursued the polarization - based dark - field technique as , first , it does nt require a specially fabricated waveguide and second , space limitations in the bore of a superconducting magnet limit the possibilities for efficient edge illumination .",
    "it is clear that achieving sufficient laser rejection based on polarization requires both high quality polarizing optics and exquisite angular control .",
    "our first experiments achieved success but only for times of a few minutes after which the dark - field setting had to be re - optimized .",
    "this is likely to be a common problem .",
    "here , we present both the mechanical and optical design of a dark - field microscope for resonance fluorescence experiments on a quantum dot . all the figures of merit are excellent , state - of - the art or better : polarization filtering allows us to suppress the excitation laser in the detection beam path by up to 8 orders of magnitude ; in combination with a reasonably high light collection efficiency , resonance fluorescence can be measured with a signal - to - background ratio exceeding @xmath2 .",
    "the property we emphasize however is _",
    "stability_. the long - term stability is such that the microscope can be operated for many days in a set - and - forget mode .",
    "our own motivation for developing the dark - field microscope was to push forward a research programme on single self - assembled quantum dots .",
    "however , we stress that our dark - field microscope is not limited to this field",
    ". it will be a perfect tool in the exploration of other quantum emitters for instance colour centres in diamond , single molecules and colloidal quantum dots .",
    "the design of the dark - field microscope makes no particular demands on the sample although a flat , smooth surface is best .",
    "once the optics wavelength range is adapted to the emission range , the dark field concept operates equally well with the sample at room temperature or at low temperature . here , as an example of a two - level system in the solid state , we study self - assembled ingaas quantum dots emitting at wavelengths around @xmath3{nm}$ ] at low temperature .",
    "the microscope combines both high spatial resolution , implemented by a confocal set - up , and dark - field performance .",
    "it is designed to allow background - free detection of resonance fluorescence while operating in a set - and - forget mode .",
    "the excitation and detection beams both follow the main axis of the microscope .",
    "thus , laser light back - reflected at the sample has to be suppressed .",
    "apart from its spatial mode , monochromatic laser light is characterized by two distinct features : its frequency and its state of polarization .",
    "laser light can not be distinguished from the quantum dot emission in frequency as it is a resonant scattering process .",
    "however , the state of polarization allows a discrimination to be made between laser and quantum dot photons .",
    "the light excitation and detection polarization states have to be orthogonal , here linear s and linear p.    laser light suppression is implemented by means of orthogonal excitation / collection polarization states , in our case by two polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) , one linear polarizer and a quarter - wave plate .",
    "their spatial arrangement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticsschematic ] .",
    "the purpose of the pbss is to reject back - scattered laser light ; the linear polarizer and quarter - wave plate define and control the state of light polarization . in this scheme ,",
    "the pbss define linear s - polarization and linear p - polarization for excitation and detection , respectively .",
    "the linear polarizer sets the polarization of the laser light to s - polarization before striking the pbs , the quarter - wave plate controls the polarization thereafter .",
    "in particular , the quarter - wave plate allows for a compensation should an elliptically be inadvertently induced . the back - scattered s - polarized laser light is reflected by both the first and second pbs by @xmath4{^{\\circ}}$ ] such that the s - polarization is highly suppressed in transmission . the p - polarized component of the quantum dot emission , however , is transmitted and can be detected .",
    "experiments on single semiconductor quantum dots typically require low temperatures .",
    "the dark - field microscope is therefore integrated into a free - beam microscope system developed for low temperature experiments .",
    "the microscope optics apart from the objective lens remain under ambient conditions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticsschematic ] . the construction frame for the microscope  head \"",
    "is a @xmath5{mm}$ ] cage system that allows a modular design : the lower horizontal microscope `` arm '' provides the excitation laser , the vertical arm is used for light detection and the upper horizontal arm to image the sample surface .",
    "each module is attached to a central cage , hosting the pbss .",
    "the lower horizontal microscope arm provides a link between remote excitation sources and the microscope .",
    "its output is a well collimated beam of coherent laser light , precisely controlled in linear polarization , and used to excite a single quantum dot resonantly .",
    "a single mode ( sm ) fibre ( font canada sm fibre @xmath6 , mode field diameter ( mdf ) @xmath7 { \\mu m}$ ] ) interconnects the microscope and the excitation laser ( toptica dl pro 940 ) . by adjusting an x / y - translation stage ( thorlabs cp1xy ) ,",
    "the fibre core can be centered on the optical axis defined by the collimator ( thorlabs c280tme - b @xmath8 , @xmath9{mm}$ ] ) which is mounted in a z - translation stage ( thorlabs sm1z ) .",
    "aspheric lenses are used to collimate / focus the laser beam , as they provide diffraction limited performance for monochromatic applications .",
    "a metallic nanoparticle linear film polarizer ( thorlabs lpvis050-mp ) mounted on a rotary stepper positioner ( attocube anr240 ) polarizes the excitation laser linearly and additionally allows the axis of linear polarization to be precisely controlled .",
    "the piezo - driven rotary stepper positioner provides both @xmath10{^{\\circ}}$ ] endless rotation and a step size as small as @xmath11{\\rm m^{\\circ}}$ ] .",
    "furthermore , after aligning the polarizer position by means of the control electronics ( attocube anc300 ) , the piezos are grounded and their position is locked , providing outstanding long - term stability .",
    "the four cage rods of the excitation arm are connected to a tilt stage ( thorlabs kc1-t / m ) which is attached to the central beam splitter cage and allows for a compensation of any angular displacement of the beam .",
    "the vertical microscope arm is designed to collect light efficiently with a confocal rejection of any stray light .",
    "this relies on coupling into a sm fibre ( font canada sm fibre @xmath6 , mdf @xmath7{\\mu m}$ ] ) which interconnects the microscope and the detectors .",
    "the same optical and opto - mechanical components as for the light collimation unit of the horizontal arm are used .",
    "the vertical arm is assembled directly on to the pbs cage .",
    "the lower tilt stage allows to correct for a misalignment with respect to the optical axis of the objective lens ( thorlabs 352330-b @xmath12 , @xmath13{mm}$ ] ) .",
    "the upper horizontal microscope arm provides the possibility of monitoring the objective lens focal plane , i.e.  the sample surface .",
    "an achromatic lens ( thorlabs ac254 - 150-b - ml , @xmath14{mm}$ ] ) focuses light onto the chip of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) camera ( allied vision technologies guppy f-503b ) , resulting in a magnified image ( magnification of 48 ) of the sample surface . again",
    "a tilt stage allows angular control of the optical axis .",
    "all modules of the microscope are attached to a central cage made from a solid piece of aluminum .",
    "it provides stability to the microscope and at the same time hosts two pbss ( b.  halle & nachfolger ptw 2.10 ) , crucial to implement the polarization filtering .",
    "the pbss allow beam splitting sensitive to the polarization of the incident beam .",
    "two right angle prisms made of flint glass are cemented together to form a cube .",
    "a dielectric beam - splitter coating which is deposited on one of the prisms provides a close to unity transmission for p - polarized and close to zero transmission for s - polarized light .    a quarter - wave plate ( b.  halle & nachfolger rzq 4.10 ) is mounted beneath the pbss on a second piezo rotary stage .",
    "( note that the quarter - wave plate behaves as a half - wave plate for the reflected laser light as the laser beam passes it twice . ) on the one hand , it is useful during the setup procedure to misalign the quarter - wave plate deliberately and allow some reflected laser light into the detection arm . on the other hand , the quarter - wave plate represents an extra degree of freedom and it turns out that this is crucial : it compensates for any distortion from linear to elliptical polarization in the two polarization states .",
    "it is not exactly clear where these small distortions arise , but they are probably related to a birefringence of the sample ( gaas with thin metal layer ) , objective lens or the cryostat window .",
    "the quarter - wave plate used here is a zero order wave plate designed for @xmath15{nm}$ ] and was chosen because , first , it is less temperature sensitive than the multi - order counterparts ; and , second , its performance at these particular wavelengths @xmath16{nm}$ ] surpasses the performance of achromatic wave plates .",
    "again a crucial point for the long - term behavior of the dark - field microscope is that the quarter - wave plate is mounted on a piezo positioner , as for the linear polarizer .",
    "the microscope is inserted into a @xmath17{\\rm inch}$ ] bore stainless steel bore , evacuated , and filled with @xmath18{\\rm mbar}$ ] he gas ( exchange gas ) at room temperature .",
    "the tube is then slowly inserted into a he bath cryostat equipped with a @xmath19{\\rm t}$ ] superconducting solenoid .",
    "the optics at @xmath20{\\rm k}$ ] are possibly subject to thermal drift but these are minimized by working in a @xmath21{^\\circ \\rm c}$ ] temperature stabilized laboratory .",
    "the microscope operates in both confocal and dark - field modes . for confocal performance ,",
    "the excitation and collection beams must be concentric and parallel to the optical axis of the objective lens . while monitoring the focal spots on the sample surface , the tilt stages are aligned in order to superimpose the focal spots .",
    "the @xmath22-position of the sample relative to the objective focal plane is adjusted by moving the sample with nanometer precision . during this alignment step , laser light",
    "is also coupled into the fibre of the vertical microscope arm .",
    "subsequently , once the confocal condition has been achieved , the linear polarizer and quarter - wave plate are aligned to suppress the back - reflected laser light . in a first step",
    ", the linear polarizer is aligned to define the polarization of the laser to s. one approach is to monitor the transmitted signal at the pbs as the polarizer is moved . a minimum in transmission is required . in a second step ,",
    "the quarter - wave plate is rotated for optimum laser suppression .",
    "we find that iterative fine tuning of the polarizer and quarter - wave plate angles enhances the rejection further .",
    "piezo - electronics allow remote control of both the angle of the linear polarizer and the quarter - wave plate .",
    "once the angles are set , the piezos are grounded .",
    "the performance of the dark - field microscope is characterized under real , experimental conditions : the laser is focused on a quantum dot sample in a low temperature experiment .",
    "the ingaas quantum dots are grown by molecular beam epitaxy utilizing a strain - driven self - assembly process and are embedded in a schottky diode@xcite .",
    "they are separated from an n@xmath23 back contact by a @xmath24{\\rm nm}$ ] thick gaas tunnel barrier . on top of the quantum dots",

    "the increase in linewidth with power reflects power broadening . whereas the background , the residual laser signal , increases linearly with laser power , the quantum dot emission saturates and , thus",

    "the optics of the dark - field microscope define linear s for the excitation and linear p for the detection polarization .",

    "for instance , given that the quantum dot basis ( @xmath71/@xmath72 ) is dot - dependent@xcite , it may be valuable in the future to include also a way of rotating the microscope basis ( s / p ) relative to the @xmath71/@xmath72 basis , either by inserting an additional wave plate or by rotating the sample . it may also be interesting to develop the capability of operating the microscope not with s / p polarizations but with @xmath67/@xmath68 polarizations .",
    "finally , we note that the quantum efficiency of the resonance fluorescence collection is limited by the high refractive index of the sample : light is refracted to such large angles at the gaas / vacuum interface that it is collected inefficiently . in this experiment",
    ", this situation was rectified to some degree ( factor of @xmath80 in signal strength ) by the solid immersion lens . despite this low quantum efficiency ,",
    "the rejection of the scattered laser light in our dark - field microscope is more than sufficient to observe background - free resonance fluorescence from single quantum dots .",
    "the next step is therefore to increase the collection efficiency : the dark - field performance is already more than good enough .",
