    "in these last years innovative fields for cutting - edge technologies based on novel engineered materials have been disclosed by the understanding of the non - equilibrium optical control of the matter .",
    "for instance the comprehension of the non - equilibrium mechanisms is of paramount importance for exploiting the physical and optical properties of the phase - change materials ( pcms ) , nowadays used in optical data storage @xcite and non - volatile electrical memories @xcite .",
    "the key feature of these intriguing compounds is the large and steep change of the optical and electrical properties observed when comparing the covalent bonded amorphous phase with the resonantly bonded crystalline phase .",
    "interestingly , this scenario has been recently enriched by the chalcogenide superlattice ( csl ) , that are regarded as novel phase - change materials @xcite , where the phase transition is between two crystalline structures , rather than amorphous to crystalline or vice - versa .    however , it is stimulating the fact that all these materials share common phase change properties , such as the switching time , the activation energy and the dielectric response , hence suggesting that a similar physics must govern the complex nature of their local atomic structure and configuration conditions .    to shed light on these compelling mechanisms , some models , based mainly on thermal or electronic processes ,",
    "have been proposed.@xcite conversely , other studies @xcite suggest that more complex mechanisms are governing the atomic dynamics at the base of the phase switching , where concomitant thermal and electronic aspects compete in a synergic feedback loop @xcite . yet ,",
    "the structural dynamics during fast temperature quenching processes of overheated gsts glasses and crystals is still unclear.@xcite . indeed , when the heating - cooling cycle between two structural phases is closely observed , a variety of parameters ( from quenching velocity to thermal dissipation and/or structural strain ) dictate the out - of - equilibrium dynamical evolution in the energy phase space across either the amorphous - crystal or the crystalline - crystalline phase transformation@xcite .",
    "henceforth , the role of the quenching processes on the final structural configuration may not simply be a thermal dissipation , especially when the cooling rate are in the range of 10@xmath0k / s or the heating stimulus is intense and ultrafast , i.e. in the ps time range .    to address these questions",
    "requires a description of the structural changes occurring at atomic level during the amorphous - crystalline phase transition or vice - versa .",
    "obviously the amorphous character of one phase rules out the possibility of using direct long range order probe such as time - resolved x - ray diffraction .",
    "unfortunately , this information entails to achieve unprecedented experimental and theoretical insights on the fundamental mechanisms at the base of the phase change transition related to the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the local atomic structure during the quenching process .",
    "scope of this work is to clarify the role of the ultrafast thermal strain dynamics in a csl structure during the first instants of the heating - cooling cycle . here by mean of first - principles multiple scattering simulations for interpreting time resolved x - ray absorption ( tr - xas ) experiments",
    ", we unveil the microscopic structural and the dynamical changes occurring after the ultrafast heating of a nominal [ gete(1nm)/sb@xmath1te@xmath2(3nm)]@xmath3 csl .",
    "the present results allow to unambiguously ascribe the distinct features of tr - xas spectra to the dynamical structural strain occurring during the thermal quenching process .",
    "recently , ge l@xmath2-edge xas of gete based alloys@xcite have been interpreted using real - space _ ab - initio _ multiple scattering simulations on crystalline and amorphous models .",
    "these studies have confirmed the effectiveness of the ge l@xmath2-edge as a spectroscopic probe to distinguish changes of the local atomic and electron charge distribution around the ge photo - absorber .",
    "therefore , by extending the ge l@xmath2 absorption edge measurement to the time domain , unprecedented details about the local atomic structural dynamics during out - of - equilibrium states , like pre - melting phases and fast cooling processes , could be accessed .",
    "in addition , unlike x - ray diffraction , tr - xas can be applied to both the crystalline and amorphous phases providing a unique information about the projected density of states ( pdos ) .",
    "in the present experiment we probe an as - grown [ gete(1nm)/sb@xmath1te@xmath2(3nm)]@xmath3csl , which has been grown on the sb - passivated surfaces of si(111 ) , ( @xmath4)r30@xmath5-sb , at a substrate temperature of 230 @xmath5c , and capped with terminal layer for preventing oxidation . @xcite .",
    "the experiments have been carried out at the beamline bach of the elettra synchrotron light source in trieste , italy , which operates an optical pump and x - ray probe technique capable of performing tr - xas experiments with sub - nanosecond time resolution , hence making possible the direct observation of the structural evolution on ultrafast time scales .",
    "a general description of the setup is reported elsewhere.@xcite in its standard multi - bunch operating mode , the elettra storage ring delivers x - ray pulses with : ( i ) low intensity ( @xmath610@xmath7 photons / pulse in a quasi - monochromatic beam ) , ( ii ) high repetition rate ( 500 mhz ) and ( iii ) a @xmath6100 ps full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) photon pulse temporal profile .",
    "this last parameter dictates the maximum time resolution of this experimental scheme .",
    "a ti - sapphire amplified laser source operating at @xmath6233 khz repetition rate and synchronized with the storage ring radio frequency is used and delivers pump pulses of up to 50 fs pulses at 800 nm , with an energy / pulse of @xmath66 @xmath8j .",
    "the time jitter of the laser with respect to the x - ray pulses is less then 5 ps , while the other relevant laser parameters are reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the absorbed energy per pulse is calculated by measuring the sample transmittance response in the 0.1 - 1 ev energy range and extrapolating the response function value at 1.55 ev ( see discussion in si ) .",
    ".[tab1]laser parameters [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the average temperature distribution t(t ) in the film is calculated from fourier s law in one dimension , assuming that the electrons and phonons in the system remain in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this changing temperature distribution creates a structural strain that can be calculated as @xmath9 since any assumption about the strength of the electron - electron and electron - phonon couplings is neglected , it is safe to assume thermal relaxation between the electron and phonon baths @xcite .    considering a consistent thermodynamical approach",
    ", @xmath10 t can be calculated through @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the film density @xcite , @xmath13 the specific heat ( see si for a detailed discussion ) , v the heated volume , and @xmath10q the overall energy absorbed per laser pulse ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this approach allows us to predict an average temperature increase @xmath14 300 k , per pulse , of the heated volume .",
    "consequently , @xmath15 can be calculated for our csl sample from equation [ eq4 ] , which results a factor @xmath62.5 higher than the gst@xmath16 case ( both values are indicated in table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this implies that , at least during the fast thermal quenching , the csl structure is softer ( higher @xmath15 ) then the bulk case .",
    "finally , it is important to underly that the extrapolated value of @xmath10 t , for time delays below 150 ps ( fig . [ fig2](d ) ) , does not exceed the melting temperature of the superlattice @xcite . combining this finding with the experimental observation that no phase transformation ( e.g. melting ) is observed by means of tr - xas ,",
    "we demonstrate that ultrafast optical overheating is a reversible process at this laser fluence regime and photon energy .",
    "in conclusion , the dynamics of the ge local atomic structure in a chalcogenide superlattice , during the thermal quenching phase of a reversible ultrafast heating - fast cooling cycle is revealed by time resolved xas and first - principle theory modelling .",
    "in addition to probing the atomic local structure , our approach reveals the significant impact of the lattice strain on the strength of bonds between atoms , from which strongly depends the quenching dynamics and , for example , the melting kinetics of a solid .",
    "our method is used here to ( i ) interpret the observed xas spectral changes in terms of a dynamical microstructural picture of the ge 4p - bonding relaxation and ( ii ) estimate relevant elastic properties of the out - of - equilibrium state of the csl film .",
    "futhermore , by combining thermoelastic considerations and a microscopic multiple scattering approach we establish a direct connection between the structural microscopic evolution and the dielectric response in a csl , which is fundamental for developing a microscopic theory for ultrafast phase transition and ultimately design new pcms with improved performances .",
    "all together these results can open the route for future studies aimed to clarify the role of a transient structural strain on the strength of bonds between atoms in phase change materials in the proximity or even during a phase transition .",
