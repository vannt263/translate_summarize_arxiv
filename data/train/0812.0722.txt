    "the notion of the intrinsic charm ( ic ) content of the proton has been introduced over 25 years ago in ref .",

    "this component can be generated by @xmath13 fluctuations inside the proton where the gluons are coupled to different valence quarks .",
    "the original concept of the charm density in the proton @xcite has nonperturbative nature since a five - quark contribution @xmath14 scales as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-quark mass @xcite .    in the middle of nineties , another point of view on the charm content of the proton",
    "has been proposed in the framework of the variable - flavor - number scheme ( vfns ) @xcite .",
    "the vfns is an approach alternative to the traditional fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) where only light degrees of freedom ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are considered as active . within the vfns",
    ", the mass logarithms of the type @xmath9 are resummed through the all orders into a heavy quark density which evolves with @xmath3 according to the standard dglap @xcite evolution equation .",
    "hence this approach introduces the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the heavy quarks and changes the number of active flavors by one unit when a heavy quark threshold is crossed . note also that the charm density arises within the vfns perturbatively via the @xmath20 evolution .",
    "some recent developments concerning the vfns are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "presently , both nonperturbative ic and perturbative charm density are widely used for a phenomenological description of available data .",
    "( a recent review of the theory and experimental constraints on the charm quark distribution may be found in ref .",
    "in particular , practically all the recent versions of the cteq @xcite and mrst @xcite sets of pdfs are based on the vfn schemes and contain a charm density . at the same time",
    ", the key question remains open : how to measure the charm content of the proton ?",
    "the basic theoretical problem is that radiative corrections to the heavy - flavor production cross sections are large : they increase the leading order ( lo ) results by approximately a factor of two .",
    "moreover , soft - gluon resummation of the threshold sudakov logarithms indicates that higher - order contributions can also be substantial .",
    "( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) on the other hand , perturbative instability leads to a high sensitivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters : the heavy - quark mass , @xmath16 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath23 and the pdfs .",
    "for this reason , one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for charm production cross sections in the entire energy range from the fixed - target experiments @xcite to the rhic collider @xcite .",
    "since production cross sections are not perturbatively stable , they can not be a good probe of the charm density in the proton . as the radiative corrections to the dominant photon - gluon fusion mechanism . ] for this reason , it is of special interest to study those observables that are well - defined in pqcd .",
    "nontrivial examples of such observables were proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the azimuthal @xmath24 asymmetry and callan - gross ratio @xmath0 in heavy quark leptoproduction were analyzed.@xmath25 in particular , the born - level results were considered @xcite and the nlo soft - gluon corrections to the basic mechanism , photon - gluon fusion ( gf ) , were calculated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the production cross sections , the azimuthal asymmetry in heavy flavor photo- and leptoproduction is quantitatively well defined in pqcd : the contribution of the dominant gf mechanism to the asymmetry is stable , both parametrically and perturbatively .",
    "therefore , measurements of this asymmetry should provide a clean test of pqcd . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the azimuthal asymmetry in open charm photoproduction could be measured with an accuracy of about ten percent in the approved e160/e161 experiments at slac @xcite using the inclusive spectra of secondary ( decay ) leptons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the photon-(heavy ) quark scattering ( qs ) contribution to @xmath26-dependent lepton - hadron deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) was investigated .",
    "it turned out that , contrary to the basic photon - gluon fusion component , the qs mechanism is practically @xmath24-independent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quark - scattering contribution to the @xmath24 asymmetry is , for kinematic reasons , absent at lo and is negligibly small at nlo , of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "this indicates that the azimuthal distributions in charm leptoproduction could be good probe of the charm pdf in the proton .",
    "the perturbative and parametric stability of the gf predictions for the callan - gross ratio @xmath0 in heavy - quark leptoproduction was considered in ref .",
    "it was shown that large radiative corrections to the structure functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 cancel each other in their ratio @xmath30 with good accuracy . as a result , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions of the dominant gf mechanism to the callan - gross ratio are less than @xmath31 in a wide region of the variables @xmath2 and @xmath32 .    in the present paper",

    "<S> we analyze the callan - gross ratio @xmath0 in heavy - quark leptoproduction as a probe of the charm content of the proton . to estimate the charm - initiated contributions , we use the acot(@xmath1 ) variable - flavor - number scheme . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that charm densities of the recent cteq sets of parton distributions have sizeable impact on the callan - gross ratio in a wide region of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the acot(@xmath1 ) predictions for the quantity @xmath4 are about half as large as the corresponding expectations of the photon - gluon fusion mechanism for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the structure functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 have different dependences on the mass logarithms of the type @xmath9 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> our recent studies indicate that , contrary to the production cross sections , the callan - gross ratio is sufficiently stable under radiative corrections to the photon - gluon fusion component for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the quantity @xmath4 in heavy - quark leptoproduction is perturbatively stable but sensitive to resummation of the mass logarithms . for this reason , in contrast to the structure functions , the ratio @xmath11 could be good probe of the charm density in the proton . </S>"
