    "wz sagittae is a fascinating source which has been the subject of much research in the field of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) @xmath8 interacting binaries in which a roche lobe filling k or m dwarf secondary transfers matter onto a white dwarf ( wd ) primary ( warner 1987 , 1995 ) .",
    "wz sge is a member of the dwarf novae @xmath8 a subclass of the cvs characterized by semiperiodic outbursts @xmath8 and furthermore it is the prototype of the `` wz sagittae '' stars which have short orbital periods ( @xmath9 min for wz sge @xmath8 krzemiski 1962 ) and only exhibit very infrequent `` superoutbursts '' that last @xmath10 d. previous superoutbursts from wz sge occurred in 1913 , 1946 , and 1978 .",
    "the most recent superoutburst began 23 july 2001 and ended 18 aug 2001 .",
    "the time since the previous superoutburst ( 23 yr ) is significantly less than the previous two recurrence times ( both 33 yr ) .    due to the widespread interest in wz sge and fortuitous timing of the 2001 superoutburst ,",
    "a large number of amateur astronomers observed the system , and as a result the outburst light curve is particularly well defined .",
    "the obvious deviation from an exponential shape , which is rendered observable due to a combination of both the relatively large dynamic range in @xmath11 and also the long duration of a superoutburst , has implications for the physics of accretion of the gas in the accretion disk onto the wd .",
    "smak ( 1993 ) summarizes previous observational and theoretical work on wz sge .",
    "he discusses the superoutbursts in wz sge in terms of the accretion disk limit cycle model ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , cannizzo 1993a ) , and estimates an accretion disk mass needed to power the superoutburst of @xmath7 g. there has been some debate on the quiescent evolution of the accretion disk in the wz sge stars .",
    "if the matter accumulates in the usual way during quiescence , smak ( 1993 ) calculates that the quiescent value of the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) alpha parameter @xmath12 must be smaller by a factor @xmath13 than for normal dwarf novae to accumulate this much gas .",
    "hameury , lasota , & hur ( 1997 , see also lasota , kuulkers , & charles 1999 ) present an alternate viewpoint in which outbursts are triggered by a fluctuation in the mass transfer from the secondary star , and the `` normal '' @xmath12 value of a few hundredths prevails in quiescence .",
    "if the matter is brought over from the secondary in @xmath14 d , for example , this would imply a temporary mass transfer rate of @xmath15 g s@xmath1 .",
    "meyer - hofmeister , meyer , & liu ( 1998 ) present a time dependent model using a small @xmath16 , plus evaporation of matter from the inner disk to prevent inside - out outbursts .",
    "in connection with very evolved systems such as wz sge , meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1999 ) discuss a possible physical mechanism for generating low @xmath12 in cool accretion disks with little or no partial ionization , which involves a much - reduced efficiency for the magneto - rotational instability for turbulent angular momentum transport in the accretion disk ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 , hawley & balbus 1991 , see also gammie & menou 1998 , menou 2000 , balbus & terquem 2001 ) . in this work",
    "we restrict our attention to the outbursting state .",
    "in any time dependent physical system where processes which operate over a wide range in time scale mediate the equilibrium level of a given physical quantity @xmath8 in this instance the mass of the accretion disk @xmath8 the controlling or governing time scale is that which is the slowest . for our study",
    "this is the viscous time at the outer disk edge . aside from complications such as the precessing , eccentric outer disk which is thought to develop and give rise to superhumps in the light curve ( whitehurst 1988 , hirose & osaki 1990 , murray & armitage 1998 ) , the superoutbursting disk is relatively simple in",
    "that the surface density @xmath17 at all radii far exceeds the critical surface density @xmath18 below which the cooling thermal transition is thought to occur .",
    "therefore the entire disk is in the hot , ionized state , and the disk mass can only decrease through accretion onto the central wd .",
    "( there is also some mass loss from the outer edge due to the tidal action from the secondary star , and from intermediate radii through winds . )",
    "one can obtain a simple estimate of the viscous time at the outer disk edge by using the `` vertically - averaged '' equations which give the radial disk structure ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . since the observed superoutburst energy constrains the @xmath19 mass of the disk ( smak 1993 ) , we require scalings of the disk variables in terms of surface density @xmath20 rather than the usual accretion rate @xmath21 . eqn .",
    "[ a6 ] of cannizzo & reiff ( 1992 ) gives the midplane disk temperature @xmath22 , where the keplerian frequency @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the value of alpha in the outbursting disk ( @xmath25 , smak 1984 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "if we adopt an opacity law for the ionized state @xmath26 g @xmath27 @xmath28 and use the condition of local hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the local sound speed , @xmath31 is the local disk semi - thickness , @xmath32 the ideal gas constant , and @xmath33 the mean molecular weight @xmath34 ) , we then get for the viscous time    @xmath35 d @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 g @xmath40 ,    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 cm ) .",
    "the value @xmath43 g @xmath27 used in the @xmath20 scaling comes from smak s ( 1993 ) estimate of the mass @xmath44 g in the disk at @xmath19 , taken to be distributed in a steady state profile @xmath45 extending to @xmath46 cm .",
    "the other parameters have been scaled in rough accord with smak s summary : primary mass @xmath47 and outer disk radius @xmath48 cm .",
    "the viscous time scale @xmath49 represents an @xmath50folding time over which local surface density perturbations at a given radius are smoothed out in a dynamically evolving disk .    assuming that the mass in the decaying disk is continually redistributed",
    "so that it always extends out to the ( formal ) outer disk radius , and that @xmath24 is constant , we see that basic disk theory predicts @xmath51 .",
    "as the mass drains onto the wd and the surface density in the disk decreases , one should see a corresponding increase in the locally defined time scale associated with the decay light curve at a given point , given that the luminosity varies as the rate of change of disk mass , or @xmath52 .",
    "even if the global decay of the light curve does not have precisely an exponential form , one can always define a small local patch of it to be exponential , so that by definition the time scale defined from a local tangent to the light curve @xmath53 .",
    "standard values of @xmath54 imply a critical surface density for cooling @xmath55 at @xmath56 of @xmath57 g @xmath27 . at this point",
    "the cooling front forms at the outer edge and the subsequent decay is much faster .",
    "therefore , theory predicts that the superoutburst should end when the initial value of @xmath58 g @xmath27 has decreased to @xmath57 g @xmath27 , a dynamic range of about a factor of 20 . since @xmath59 , this implies an increase by a factor @xmath60 in the locally defined decay time scale for the superoutbursting light curve from start to end .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath11 data from the vsnet website of the july - aug 2001 superoutburst of wz sge .",
    "the data are contributed by amateur astronomers spanning many organizations across the world .",
    "the first panel presents all the individual data points .",
    "one can see by eye a noticeable departure from exponentiality in the decay ( i.e. , from a straight line when plotted as @xmath11 versus time ) .",
    "the second panel shows moving two day averages of the light curve binned into 0.2 d bins .",
    "the third panel shows the decay time scale computed from the light curve in the second panel . from @xmath4 july 2001 to @xmath61 aug 2001 , the locally defined decay time scale increased from @xmath62 d mag@xmath1 to @xmath63 d mag@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with our scaling law from the previous section .",
    "( one @xmath50folding [ i.e. , @xmath64 exceeds 1 mag [ i.e. , @xmath65 by about 8% , a difference which we ignore given the crudeness of the theoretical @xmath49 scaling . )      as a final check , we utilize our time dependent accretion disk code to calculate a detailed light curve ( for descriptions of the code see cannizzo 1993b , 2001 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath66 , @xmath67 cm , and @xmath68 cm . at @xmath19",
    "we place a cold torus of gas at @xmath69 in the form of a gaussian , with a width @xmath70 cm .",
    "we perform two trials : one with @xmath71 g @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath72 g ) , and one with @xmath73 g @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath74 g ) .",
    "this is motivated by smak s inferred initial disk mass @xmath7 g. figure 2 shows the light curves and associated decay time scales for these models . as expected , the deviations from exponentiality are seen here as well .",
    "it is interesting that the dynamic range over which @xmath75 changes is about a factor of two , which is slightly less than seen in wz sge .",
    "this may be a reflection of the crude ( planckian ) flux distributions which are used to model the local emissivity in the disk .",
    "the calculations of @xmath76 based on @xmath77 show a larger dynamic variation .",
    "our result supports the standard model for dwarf nova outbursts in which the outbursting disk decays primarily via simple accretion onto the wd when in the `` viscous plateau '' ( cannizzo 1993b ) stage , and @xmath54 . the faster decay which began 18 aug 2001 in wz sge",
    "would then be caused by the onset of the cooling front , its rapidness in comparison to the previous evolution stemming from the fact that the thermal time scale is shorter than the viscous time scale .",
    "it is fortunate that nature has given us the wz sge stars which remain in a viscous plateau long enough for one to be able to constrain the functional form of the decay as being demonstrably different from exponential . for longer period dwarf novae such as ss cyg ( @xmath78 hr ) in which one frequently sees flat - topped outbursts where the disk is also presumably entirely in the hot state , the short duration ( @xmath79 d ) of the viscous state due to a smaller initial surface density excess @xmath80 in the outer disk , combined with the slower viscous time at the outer disk ( due to larger @xmath81 ) , conspire to produce a much smaller dynamic variation in @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , the variations that are seen may be due almost entirely to sloshing action of the gas in the disk as it responds to the matter redistribution accompanying the outburst .",
    "it is interesting to ponder the implications for other types of systems , for example the soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) in which the accreting object is a neutron star or black hole .",
    "the similarity between the superoutbursts in the wz sge stars and the x - ray nova outbursts seen in the some of the brightest and best studied sxts has been pointed out by kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1996 , see also kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "king & ritter ( 1998 , see also king 1998 , shahbaz , charles , & king 1998 ) propose that the @xmath82 d @xmath50folding decay times seen in these sxts are viscous , insomuch as one expects strong irradiation in the outbursting state to prevent the cooling front from forming .",
    "cannizzo ( 2000 ) argues that even though irradiation keeps the entire disk ionized , the viscous time scale would be too slow ( the time dependent computations of dubus et al .",
    "[ 2001 , e.g. fig .",
    "16a ] show an @xmath50folding decay time of @xmath83 d during the viscous plateaus of their outbursts ) , and cannizzo hypothesizes that some other agent such as strong evaporation must be at work in outburst to reduce the disk mass from the inner disk on a time scale shorter than that due to accretion acting alone .    a scaling of the viscous time at the outer edge applied to a0620 - 00 , which had a bright outburst and exponential decay in 1975 , gives    @xmath84 d @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath38 @xmath87 g @xmath40 .",
    "such a long time is problematic in accounting for the @xmath82 d @xmath50folding decay times seen in systems with a variety of orbital periods and hence outer disk radii ( see table 1 of mineshige , yamasaki , ishizaka 1993 ) , and more importantly , the rise times of @xmath88 d for the secondary maxima in the sxts which , in the model of king & ritter ( 1998 ) , are due to the arrival of matter from the outer disk to the inner disk . in reality , matter added to the disk at the outer edge and diffusing inward would spread out and not produce such a short , well - defined rise in the x - ray light curve .",
    "furthermore , it would be difficult to maintain an exponential decay over a dynamic range of @xmath89 in @xmath90 as observed , due to the decrease in @xmath91 and the fact that @xmath92 .",
    "( the dynamic ranges for viscous decays shown in dubus et al .",
    "2001 are only about a factor of 10 . )",
    "could irradiation of the outer disk in the sxts affect the midplane temperature enough to change significantly the viscous time scale ?",
    "for irradiation to be strong enough to have a significant effect on the midplane temperature ( which enters into the disk semithickness and hence viscous time scale ) , the local irradiation temperature needs to exceed not just the local non - irradiated disk photospheric temperature , but also the midplane temperature which is @xmath93 times the effective temperature , where @xmath76 is the vertically integrated optical depth . starting again with eqn . [ a6 ] from cannizzo & reiff ( 1992 ) , one can show    @xmath94 ,    an optical depth of @xmath95 through the vertical structure , so that one would need a local irradiation temperature about an order of magnitude greater than the effective temperature .",
    "realistic calculations of the irradiation effect in sxts show that the change in midplane temperature is small ( dubus et al .",
    "in other words , irradiation indeed keeps the entire disk ionized during the `` viscous '' decay ( because the irradiation temperature exceeds @xmath96 k at the outer disk edge ) , but because of the large optical depth one does not see a significant change in midplane temperature .",
    "we have examined the 2001 superoutburst light curve of wz sge .",
    "we find that the deviation from exponentiality during the time the system was in superoutburst is roughly characterized by a linear increase in the local decay time from @xmath62 d mag@xmath1 to @xmath63 d mag@xmath1 up to about two - thirds of the way through superoutburst .",
    "this is consistent with standard limit cycle accretion disk theory , adopting systemic parameters for wz sge taken from smak ( 1993 ) , namely an initial disk mass @xmath97 g , a central mass @xmath98 , an outer disk radius @xmath46 cm , and an alpha value @xmath99 . among the dwarf novae ,",
    "only the wz sge stars show a large enough dynamic range in @xmath11 in their stages of viscous decay during outburst to allow this type of study .",
    "an application of the viscous time @xmath100 scaling law to outbursts in the soft x - ray transients appears to lead to decay times which are slower than observed in several of the bright , well - studied systems ( see fig . 9 of kuulkers 1998 ) . also , the rise times of @xmath88 d for the secondary maxima seen in these systems are especially difficult to reconcile with the class of theories in which material added at the outer disk edge must diffuse to the inner edge ( chen et al .",
    "1993 , augusteijn et al .",
    "1993 , king & ritter 1998 ) since the diffusion time and the smearing time would both be @xmath101 .",
