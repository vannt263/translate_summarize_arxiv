    "it is therefore of fundamental importance to understand how itinerant magnetism , as found for example in @xmath5 transition - metal ( tm ) solids , develops starting from localized atomic magnetic moments .",
    "the strong dependence of the magnetic behavior as a function of system size , structure and composition opens in addition the possibility of using clusters to tailor new magnetic materials for specific technological purposes .",
    "consequently , the relation between local atomic environment , cluster structure and magnetism has also implications of practical interest .",
    "most theoretical studies of itinerant cluster magnetism have been performed using hartree - fock ( hf ) and local spin density ( lsd ) methods @xcite .",
    "exact many - body calculations are presently limited to simple models , such as the hubbard model , and to systems containing a small number of sites @xcite . within mean - field approximations (",
    "hf or lsd ) the self - consistent spin polarizations are usually restricted to be collinear , i.e. , the direction of all local magnetic moments is assumed to be the same .",
    "however , the well known sensitivity of itinerant magnetism to the local environment of the atoms @xcite suggests that other instabilities towards spiral - like spin - density - waves ( sdw s ) @xcite or even more complex magnetic structures should also be possible in general .",
    "for example , the tendency to antiferromagnetic ( af ) order close to half - band filling and the presence of triangular loops in compact structures generates magnetic frustrations that may easily yield complex arrangements of the local magnetic moments .",
    "moreover , the reduction of local coordination numbers at the surface of clusters removes constraints between the local moments and could favor the development of low - symmetry spin polarizations . in solids ,",

[ sec : corr ] we compare the uhf results with exact diagonalization calculations for @xmath9 atoms ( lanczos method)@xcite . the role of quantum fluctuations beyond mean field and the consequences of the often artificial breaking of spin - symmetry implied by the formation of the noncollinear local moments are discussed .",

    "[ fig : stfcc13](c ) ] .",

    "it seems that , as a result of frustrations , the more important increase of af correlations @xmath136 among the surface nn s is done at the expense of the correlations between the central atom and the surface .",

    "for @xmath83 the outermost spins ( shell 2 ) are free to couple antiferromagnetically with their nn s ( shell 1 ) . however , the presence of an additional atomic shell for @xmath84 , which has nn s belonging to both the first and second shells , forces a parallel alignment of the spins in shells 1 and 2 in order to allow af coupling with the third shell .",

    "close to the threshold for the onset of ferromagnetism ( @xmath148 ) the changes of the af - like spin arrangement produce small oscillations of @xmath86 ( see fig  [ fig : mom_14 ] ) .",
    "the approximately step - like behavior resembles at first sight the results obtained in collinear mean - field calculations@xcite .",
    "however , in the present case the physical picture behind the formation of a fm state is quite different .",
    "the increase of @xmath86 close to the steps involves a succession of noncollinear spin arrangements with increasing degree of parallel moment alignment .",

    "we have therefore determined the relative stability of a few representative cluster structures as a function of band filling @xmath8 and coulomb repulsion strength @xmath3 in the framework of the uhf approximation to the hubbard model and we have compared the results with available exact calculations @xcite .",
    "four different symmetries are considered : icosahedral clusters , which maximize the average coordination number , face centered cubic ( fcc ) and hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) clusters , as examples of compact structures which are found in the solid state , and body centered cubic ( bcc ) clusters , as an example of a rather open bipartite structure .",
    "these cluster geometries are representative of the various types of structures found to be the most stable in rigorous geometry optimizations for @xmath182@xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath78 are summarized in the form of a magnetic and structural diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phdi_13_uhf ] .",
    "a qualitative description of the type of magnetic order obtained in the self - consistent calculations is indicated by the different shadings .",
    "one may distinguish three different _ collinear _ spin arrangements : non - magnetic solutions ( nm ) , non - saturated or weak ferromagnetic solutions ( wfm ) and saturated ferromagnetic solutions ( sfm ) .",
    "the nm case includes paramagnetic states in which the total moment @xmath86 is minimal ( @xmath183 or @xmath100 ) . concerning the _ noncollinear _ spin arrangements we distinguish two cases : noncollinear nonmagnetic states ( nc ) in which non - vanishing ( eventually large ) local moments @xmath89 sum up to an approximately minimal total moment @xmath184 , and noncollinear ferromagnetic states ( ncfm ) that show a net magnetization @xmath185 .",
    "the nc states include all sort of frustrated antiferromagnetic - like spin structures , for example , those illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : stfcc13 ] and [ fig : stico13 ] . in order to quantify the effect of electron correlations we also show in fig .",
    "[ phdi_13_ex ] the corresponding magnetic and structural diagram as recently obtained by using exact diagonalization methods @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath3 ( @xmath186 ) the uhf results for the most stable of the considered structures are in very good agreement with the exact calculations [ compare figs .",
    "[ phdi_13_uhf ] and [ phdi_13_ex ] ] .",
    "the icosahedral cluster yields the lowest energy in the low carrier - concentration regime ( @xmath187 ) , as could have been expected taking into account that the largest coordination number is favored for small @xmath2 as in smaller clusters @xcite . in this case , the kinetic energy dominates ( uncorrelated limit ) and therefore the structure with the largest bandwidth is stabilized .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased several structural transitions occur . for small @xmath3 ,",
    "both exact and uhf calculations present the same structural changes : from icosahedral to fcc structure at @xmath188 , from fcc to hcp at @xmath189 , and from hcp to bcc at @xmath190 . at larger @xmath3 ( @xmath191 )",
    "the interplay between the kinetic and coulomb energies introduces important correlations that can not be accounted for within uhf and that play a central role in the determination of the magnetic and structural properties .",
    "thus , uhf often fails to yield the lowest - energy structure in the limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "a main source of discrepancy is the too strong tendency of uhf to yield sfm ground states , particularly above half - band filling , which often disagrees with the exact magnetic behavior .",
    "consequently the optimal structure is missed rather frequently .",
    "for example , for @xmath192 and large @xmath3 , uhf predicts the fcc structure with a sfm ground state , while in the exact calculation the icosahedral cluster with @xmath193 is the optimum .",
    "similar drawbacks are seen for other band fillings such as @xmath194 , 10 , 21 , and 22 ( large @xmath3 ) . still , in the event that the true ground state does show strong ferromagnetism , uhf succeeds since the ground state is the superposition of single - particle states .",
    "examples of this kind are @xmath195 and @xmath190 for large @xmath3 .",
    "these are rather exceptions , however , since the presence of a fm ground state in the exact solution is in general much less frequent than predicted by uhf . around half - band filling uhf reproduces qualitatively well the transition from fcc or hcp to icosahedral structure with increasing @xmath3 as well as nontrivial re - entrant effects ( @xmath196@xmath163 ) .",
    "however , uhf underestimates the value of @xmath3 at which the structural changes occur ( see figs .",
    "[ phdi_13_uhf ] and [ phdi_13_ex ] ) . part of the quantitative differences could be remedied by using in the uhf calculations a reduced or renormalized @xmath3 which simulates some of the effects of correlations .",
    "summarizing , uhf fails to reproduce the exact phase diagram in detail , particularly in some of the most interesting antiferromagnetic or weak ferromagnetic regimes",
    ". structural transition are sometimes missing ( e.g. , for @xmath197 ) and in other cases changes of structures appear artificially ( e.g. , bcc to hcp for @xmath198 and @xmath199 ) . nevertheless , it is also fair to say that uhf yields a good account of the relative stability between the considered structures well beyond the weakly interacting limit ( up to @xmath200 ) and that it also explains the larger stability of ferromagnetism above half - band filling . in the limit of strong interactions",
    "the validity of uhf breaks down and correlation effects beyond the single - determinant wave - function are indispensable in order to obtain the ground - state structure and magnetic behavior reliably .",
    "improvements on the uhf wave function could be introduced by restoring the broken spin symmetry as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq_sshf][eq_sshf3 ] ) ] .",
    "however , the success of such an approach is likely to depend on the geometry of the cluster .",
    "for example , in low symmetry structures uhf tends to exaggerate the formation of spin and charge density redistributions which may be far from the actual exact solution and which can be very difficult to restore _ a posteriori_. in such cases a jastrow - like variational ansatz on restricted hartree - fock states could be more appropriate .",
    "finally , it should be recalled that the hubbard model for small clusters with one orbital per site is probably the most extremely low - dimensional system one may consider .",
    "therefore , fluctuations and correlations effects are expected to be here more drastic than in larger clusters or in realistic multiband models more appropriate for the description of tm s .",
