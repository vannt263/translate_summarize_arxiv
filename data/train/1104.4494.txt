    "ngc346 is presently the region of most intense star formation in the entire small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "it contains over 30 o type stars ( massey , parker & garmany 1989 ; evans et al .",
    "2006 ) that ionise the n66 nebula , the largest hii region in the smc ( henize 1956 ) .",
    "the presence of these very young ( @xmath20myr ) massive stars in ngc346 has long been established with ground - based spectroscopy ( e.g. walborn 1978 ;",
    "walborn & blades 1986 ; niemela et al . 1986",
    "; massey et al . 1989 ) , but more recently also very young stars of low mass have been detected .",
    "observations with the hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescope have revealed respectively a multitude of pre - main sequence ( pms ) star candidates down to the subsolar mass ( nota et al .",
    "2006 ; sabbi et al . 2007 ; gouliermis et al . 2007 ; hennekemper et al . 2008 ) and a large number of candidate young stellar objects ( yso ) with masses as low as @xmath21m@xmath7(bolatto et al . 2007 ; simon et al . 2007 ) .",
    "what makes ngc346 and the surrounding regions particularly interesting is that they allow us to study the properties of star formation in a nearby galaxy with a metallicity similar to those in place in the high redshift universe at @xmath22 .",
    "the distance modulus for the smc is @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath24kpc ( hilditch et al .",
    "2005 ; keller & wood 2006 ) , whereas the currently accepted values for its metallicity range from @xmath25 to @xmath26z@xmath27 ( see russell & dopita 1992 ; rolleston et al . 1999 ; lee et al .",
    "2005 ; perez  montero & diaz 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , besides this recent burst , previous star formation episodes have been detected in this area .",
    "heap et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mokiem et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported the presence of massive stars with an age of @xmath28myr , while massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) discovered five red supergiants and two b type supergiants that form a spatially distinct subgroup located about @xmath29 sw of the centre of ngc346 and that have an estimated age of @xmath30myr .",
    "more recently , sabbi et al . ( 2007 ) detected a small star cluster , located about @xmath31 or @xmath32pc ne of the centre whose colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is compatible with an age of @xmath33myr",
    ". finally , older populations are also present : sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find evidence for star formation in this region dating as far back as @xmath34gyr with a moderate enhancement @xmath35myr ago .",
    "in addition , an intermediate - age cluster , bs90 , is also present in the field , with an age of @xmath36gyr .",
    "it is not easy to establish whether there is any relationship between the very old generations in this field and the more recent star formation episodes .",
    "however , it is interesting to investigate whether the @xmath30myr old massive stars of massey et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and the @xmath37myr old small cluster of sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , although spatially unrelated to one another , could be the precursors of the 30 young massive o type stars and of the recently detected pms stars and yso in this region .",
    "it is conceivable that a large number of these @xmath38myr old objects are actually present in ngc346 , many more than those known so far , but that they could belong to a more diffuse population spread throughout the region because of appreciable velocity dispersion motions and , therefore , might not be easy to identify .",
    "if the members of such a @xmath39myr old population could be detected , including those of low mass , their spatial distribution and physical properties would allow us to understand whether and how they may have triggered the most recent bursts , as theories of sequential star formation suggest ( e.g. elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "the task of detecting a @xmath39myr old population in a region heavily contaminated by older field stars and younger objects might appear daunting .",
    "hennekemper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) attempted to study the presence of an age spread in the pms population of ngc346 through the analysis of the cmd .",
    "they showed that the observations are in principle compatible with an upper limit of @xmath34myr to the age , but they concluded that differential reddening and unresolved binaries could be at the origin of the observed colour spread .    actually , if these objects have not yet completed their pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase , it should be possible to detect them through the distinctive excess emission features in their spectra that originate from the accretion process , particularly in the uv continuum and in recombination lines such as h@xmath3 , pa@xmath40 and br@xmath41 ( e.g. calvet et al . 2000 ) .",
    "although in nearby star forming regions the fraction of pms stars with discs appears to decline quite rapidly during the first 10myr ( e.g. haisch , lada & lada 2001 ; fedele et al .",
    "2010 ) , there is evidence that sustained mass accretion is present also in objects older than this age , particularly above 1m@xmath7 .",
    "this is the case for instance of tr37 where sicilia  aguilar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find g - type dwarfs still accreting at ages in excess of 10myr . in the more distant ( @xmath42kpc ) and massive galactic star forming region ngc3603 beccari et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recently found a conspicuous number of pms stars older than 10myr still undergoing mass accretion . in even more distant and dense stellar fields , where spectroscopy of individual stars is limited to the brightest members , romaniello ( 1998 ) , panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and romaniello , robberto & panagia ( 2004 ) have shown that objects undergoing active mass accretion can be efficiently detected with accurate multi - colour photometry and have identified in the regions around sn1987a about 500 pms stars with h@xmath3 equivalent width in excess of 8  and with an age of @xmath43myr .",
    "more recently , de marchi , panagia & romaniello ( 2010 , hereafter paperi ) showed that through a suitable combination of broad- and narrow - band photometry it is also possible to derive the mass accretion rate of these objects , with an accuracy comparable to that allowed by spectroscopy .",
    "in this work , we build on the method developed in paperi to securely identify bona - fide pms objects in dense stellar fields and apply it to the high - quality hst photometry of the ngc346 region ( sabbi et al .",
    "our goal is to measure the physical properties of these objects and study how they depend on age , in order to understand how star formation has proceeded in this area over the past @xmath44myr .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section[obser ] we briefly describe the observations and address how we correct for differential reddening , whereas section[pmsst ] is devoted to the identification of pms stars via their h@xmath3 excess emission and on the determination of their h@xmath3 luminosity . in section[physi ] we derive the other important physical parameters for these objects , including age , mass and mass accretion rate , while in section[evolu ] we study how the latter evolves in time , how it could affect stellar evolution , and we compare the results to those for similar objects in the milky way and large magellanic cloud .",
    "a summary of the most important conclusions of the paper is offered in section[summa ] .",
    "the observations used in this work were collected with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( ford et al .",
    "2003 ) on board the hubble space telescope in 2004 july as part of proposal go10248 ( with antonella nota as principal investigator ) .",
    "the data and their reduction were extensively described in sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , to which we refer the reader for details . in summary , the observations of interest here cover an area of @xmath45 on a side centered on the cluster ngc346 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , at ra@xmath46 , dec=@xmath47 ( j2000 ) , itself immersed in n66 , the largest and brightest hii region in the smc .",
    "the data comprise both deep and short exposures in the broad bands f555w ( hereafter @xmath0 ) and f814w ( hereafter @xmath1 ) , as well as observations in the 80  wide band f658n ( hereafter h@xmath3 ) , which were not described in sabbi et al .",
    "the total combined exposure times in each band are , respectively , 4148s , 4124s and 1542s .",
    "the data reduction in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands was carried out by sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using a combination of psf fitting and aperture photometry and their final catalogue , in the central @xmath48 of interest here , includes about 53550 stars reliably detected ( at the @xmath49 level ) in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as regards the h@xmath3 band , we have adopted the same combination of psf fitting and aperture photometry to search for and measure all objects with a signal in the central pixel exceeding the local background level by at least 3 times the standard deviation of the latter ( i.e. @xmath49 detection ) .",
    "of all the stars detected in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , about 19800 satisfy this condition also in the h@xmath3 band .",
    "we show in figure[fig1 ] the resulting colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of all the stars in the selected field as light grey dots and with darker symbols stars whose mean error @xmath50 in the three bands does not exceed @xmath51mag , where    @xmath52    and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the photometric uncertainties in each individual band .",
    "a total of @xmath56 stars satisfy this condition , with the most stringent constraint being set by the uncertainty in the h@xmath3 band .",
    "the cmd , as already discussed by nota et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2006 ; 2007 ) and sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , reveals the presence in this field of both young and old populations .",
    "the former includes the massive stars on the pronounced upper main sequence ( ms ) and for the candidate pms objects to the right of and brighter than the lower ms , while the latter accounts for the lower ms and for the sub - giant and red giant branches ( sgb , rgb ) . in general , however , it is not possible to classify an object as being young or old just on the basis of its position on the cmd , not only because there are regions such as the lower ms that are common to both populations , but also because there is evidence for variable reddening in the field , as sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) already pointed out and as one can see from the conspicuous broadening of the upper ms in figure[fig1 ] .",
    "differential reddening makes it particularly difficult to understand the true nature of the large group of objects below the sgb and redder than the ms . while their colours and magnitudes , as originally pointed out by nota et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , are compatible with those of young pms stars , depending on the amount of reddening and on the specific extinction law for this field , some of them may in reality be reddened ms or sgb stars . furthermore , even if all these objects were pms stars , without accounting for differential reddening one could not properly assign to them a mass and age through the comparison with pms evolutionary tracks ( see e.g. hennekemper et al .",
    "it is therefore important to address the issue of differential reddening and to correct the photometry accordingly , to the extent possible .",
    "we do so in the following section .",
    "sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) concluded that the young population in this field , corresponding to the upper ms , is compatible with an age of @xmath57myr .",
    "therefore , one can determine the reddening towards each of those stars if one assumes that they are all ms objects and one looks at their colour and magnitude displacement with respect to a theoretical isochrone for an age of 4myr , a metallicity of @xmath58 and a distance modulus of @xmath23 ( see introduction ) .",
    "hennekemper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) followed a similar approach to derive an extinction map for this region , albeit with a set of isochrones for a higher metallicity ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we note here that although the metallicity that we adopt , @xmath58 , is at the lower end of the currently accepted values for the smc ( see introduction ) , it appears better suited to describe the properties of young pms stars , as we will show in section[physi ] .    as for the extinction law in this field",
    ", we decided to use the one derived by scuderi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the field of sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud , rather than the galactic law as adopted by hennekemper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , in light of the more similar metallicity .",
    "the total extinction values for the specific hst filters used here were derived by averaging over the entire bandpass the dust attenuation ( @xmath60 ) , as explained in romaniello et al .",
    "the solid lines cutting through the upper ms in figure[fig2]a correspond to the reddening vectors drawn from a 4myr old isochrone for @xmath58 ( marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , in steps of @xmath61 mag for stars brighter than @xmath62 .",
    "the length of the lines corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "a total of about 600 stars selected in this way and bluer than @xmath64 are marked with thicker symbols in figure[fig2]a .",
    "the corresponding reddening distribution ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( respectively 17% and 83% limits corresponding to @xmath67 values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , with a median value of @xmath70 or @xmath71 , indicating that a considerable spread in reddening is present in this field .",
    "we have used the reddening values towards each of the selected upper ms stars to derive a reddening correction for all other objects in their vicinities .",
    "the analysis of the h@xmath3 image indicates that the typical scale of the brightness fluctuations is of order @xmath72 radius .",
    "we have therefore assumed that stars projected within this region have similar extinction , even though we have no information on the depth of their distribution nor on the uniformity of the absorbing material . in order to validate the procedure , we first applied the reddening correction to the upper ms stars themselves , using for each object the average of the extinction values of at most 20 other upper ms stars within @xmath72 of their location .",
    "we took the straight average without weighting them for the distance from the object , since we have no information on the distribution of the stars along the line of sight .",
    "we found that the average and standard deviation of the reddening distribution derived with the nearest neighbours are in excellent agreement with those measured directly , namely @xmath73 .",
    "this has convinced us that the average reddening value measured in a small area surrounding each star can be used to correct for extinction .",
    "objects with no reference upper ms stars within @xmath72 were assigned the average reddening value of all reference stars ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the upper ms corrected in this way appears considerably tighter in the cmd than the raw data ( see figure[fig2]b ) and this convinced us that the method , albeit statistical in nature , can be applied to the entire data set .",
    "we also experimented with a different number of neighbours , namely 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 .",
    "we found that , by using the 20 nearest upper ms stars , the red clump ( rc ) feature in the red giant branch of old ( @xmath9gyr ) in the cmd at @xmath75 appeared the tightest .",
    "since our goal is to correct for reddening all candidate pms stars , which are typically red , this choice seemed the most appropriate .",
    "the de - reddened cmd obtained in this way is shown in figure[fig2]b .",
    "one of the characteristic signatures of the accretion process on to pms stars is the presence of excess emission in h@xmath3 ( see e.g. calvet et al .",
    "recently , we showed in paperi that pms stars undergoing active accretion can be reliably identified , and their h@xmath3 luminosity measured , by using a combination of broad - band ( @xmath76 ) and narrow - band ( h@xmath3 ) photometry , with no need for spectroscopy .",
    "this way of identifying pms stars is more accurate and reliable than the simple classification based on the position of the objects in the hertzsprung  russell diagram , i.e. stars placed well above the main sequence ( e.g. gilmozzi et al .",
    "1994 ; hunter et al .",
    "1995 ; see in particular nota et al .",
    "2006 and gouliermis et al .",
    "2007 for the specific case of ngc346 ) .",
    "the true advantages of the method presented in paperi are that : _",
    "( i ) _ it allows us to discriminate between bona - fide pms stars and interlopers that occupy the same region of the cmd ; _ ( ii ) _ it provides a secure detection of relatively old pms stars , already close to their ms , whose colours and magnitudes would otherwise be indistinguishable from those of ms stars ; _ ( iii ) _ by measuring the @xmath2 luminosity @xmath77 of these pms stars we can obtain their mass accretion rates @xmath78 from @xmath77 and the stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) ; _ ( iv ) _ finally , this approach is more practical , efficient and economical than slitless spectroscopy for studying pms stars in dense star forming regions , although it can not provide constraints for magnetospheric accretion models that require information on the profile of the h@xmath3 emission line ( e.g. muzerolle et al . 2001 ) .",
    "as explained in detail in paperi , the method hinges on the simple consideration that , at any time , the largest majority of stars of a given effective temperature @xmath79 in a stellar population will have no excess h@xmath3 emission . therefore , for stars of that effective temperature , the _",
    "median _ value of any colour index involving h@xmath3 ( e.g. @xmath80 ) effectively defines a spectral reference template with respect to which the h@xmath3 colour excess should be sought .    in figure[fig3 ]",
    "we show with small dots the @xmath80 colour as a function of @xmath81 for all 18764 stars that have a combined photometric uncertainty @xmath82mag ( see equation[eq1 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is dominated by the uncertainty on the h@xmath3 magnitude , while the median value of the uncertainty in the other two bands is @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the thick dashed line in figure[fig3 ] represents the median @xmath80 colour obtained as the running median with a box - car size of 100 points .",
    "the thin solid line shows the colours in these filters for the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . as discussed in paperi ,",
    "the @xmath85mag discrepancy between models and observations around @xmath86 is most likely due to the coarse spectral sampling of the h@xmath3 line in the models .",
    "where the density of observed points decreases considerably , at @xmath87 , we reduced the box - car size to 10 points and the result is shown by the thick dot - dashed line ( which is extrapolated for @xmath88 ) .",
    "a total of 891 objects have a @xmath80 index exceeding that of the reference template ( i.e. the photospheric colour ) at the same @xmath81 colour by more than four times the uncertainty on their @xmath80 values .",
    "the arrow in the figure corresponds to the reddening vector for @xmath89 or @xmath90 for the specific bands used in this study , derived from the extinction law of scuderi et al .",
    "the fact that the arrow is almost parallel to the reference template implies that even relatively large uncertainties in the reddening correction would not significantly affect the selection of stars with h@xmath3 excess . on the other hand , it is possible that for some objects surrounded by non homogeneous nebular emission the h@xmath3 excess that we measure is spurious .",
    "we explain in section[nebul ] how we have removed these objects from our list .",
    "the effects of nebular contamination on the detection of stars with h@xmath3 excess emission are addressed in detail in paperi ( and in beccari et al . 2010 ) , to which we refer the reader .",
    "we show there that gas emission acts like a `` pedestal , '' or an additional source of background . as such",
    ", it does not affect our photometry because it increases the measured flux in the same way both inside the central aperture and inside the background annulus used for the determination of the sky level .",
    "therefore the gas emission is automatically removed in the sky subtraction procedure .",
    "if the diffuse emission is strong compared to the intensity of the objects , the uncertainty on the flux of the star will be larger , but this is fully taken into account in our photometry .",
    "a possible complication , not discussed in paperi , arises when the nebular emission is not homogeneous across the field .",
    "for example , when a filamentary structure in the nebular gas overlaps with a star , the magnitude of the star can be affected in different ways .",
    "if the filament is wider than the diameter of the annulus that we use to measure the local background , this only results in a higher photometric uncertainty , because we fall in the case explained above for diffuse emission .",
    "the situation is more complex when the filament only partly covers the background annulus ( which in our case extends from 3 to 5 pixel radius around the object ) and/or the central star ( for which an aperture of 2 pixel radius is used ) , since in those cases the signal from the star and/or the background could be incorrectly determined .",
    "we , therefore , inspected the h@xmath3 image around the location of all stars with an apparent h@xmath3 excess . in order to enhance the contrast between neighbouring pixels in the image",
    ", we applied an unsharp - masking filter ( e.g. malin 1977 ) to the h@xmath3 frame , with a smoothing radius of 10 pixel meant to subtract the low - frequency signal , i.e. structures in the image with a characteristic scale larger than the size of our background annulus .",
    "unsharp masking makes structures and filaments in the nebular gas easier to see than in the direct image . in this way we compared the structures and filaments with the positions of the stars with halpha excess emission ( see beccari et al .",
    "2010 for an application of this method to the case of ngc3603 ) . we adopted a very conservative approach and",
    "excluded from our pms candidate list all stars whose photometric background annulus is partially covered by a gas filament . in total , about 70 stars were excluded in this way , or less than 10% of the original population ( an additional 30 stars were excluded because they are closer than 10 pixels to the image edges in the halpha frame , although their magnitudes are well defined in the other bands ) .",
    "a total of 791 objects are left after this conservative selection and they are indicated with large dots in figure[fig3 ] ( shown in red in the on - line version ) and , in light of their @xmath80 excess at the @xmath91 level , they are excellent pms candidates .",
    "as we shall see later , most of them are indeed bona - fide pms stars .      following the detailed procedure outlined in paperi",
    ", we can derive the h@xmath3 emission line luminosity @xmath77 for these stars from the @xmath92 colour corresponding to the excess emission , namely :    @xmath93    where the superscript _ obs _ refers to the observations and _ ref _ to the reference template .",
    "@xmath77 is then obtained from @xmath94 , from the photometric zero point and absolute sensitivity of the instrumental set - up and from the distance to the sources .",
    "the assumed distance modulus is @xmath95 ( see introduction ) , whereas the photometric properties of the instrument are as listed in the acs instrument handbook ( maybhate et al .",
    "the derived median @xmath2 luminosity of the 791 objects with h@xmath3 excess at the @xmath91 level is @xmath96erg / s or @xmath97l@xmath27 .",
    "this value is similar to that of a group of 189 stars with h@xmath3 excess emission in the field of sn1987a that were studied in paperi with the same method applied to hst wide field planetary camera2 data .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath77 is typically @xmath30% and is completely dominated by the statistical uncertainty on the h@xmath3 photometry ( 10% ) , while the distance accounts for 5% ( hilditch et al . 2005 ; keller & wood 2006 ) and the absolute sensitivity of the instrumental setup for another 3% .    owing to the rather wide passband of the f658n filter ,",
    "@xmath92 includes a small contribution from the [ nii ] emission features at @xmath98 and @xmath99 . even though such a contribution is small ( see paperi , where the effect is explained in detail )",
    ", it is a good practice to correct for it as it is a systematic effect .",
    "the adopted average correction factor to the intensity for the acs f658n filter , based on the spectra of classical t tauri stars is @xmath100 .",
    "besides the luminosity of the h@xmath3 emission line , also its equivalent width @xmath101 can be derived from our photometry . to this aim ,",
    "as shown in paperi , we used the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to derive the magnitude @xmath102 corresponding to the sole continuum in the h@xmath3 band from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "the corresponding relationships , properly validated by comparison with spectro - photometric measurements , are listed in the appendix of paperi and allow us to derive @xmath103 from the h@xmath3 magnitude via the equation :    @xmath104 \\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath105 is the rectangular width of the filter ( similar in definition to the equivalent width of a line ) , which depends on the characteristics of the filter and corresponds to @xmath106for the f658n filter used here .",
    "the equivalent widths obtained in this way are shown in figure[fig4 ] as a function of the @xmath81 colour .",
    "the 791 stars with a @xmath91 h@xmath3 excess are indicated with thicker symbols ( circles and squares ) .",
    "we take as bona - fide pms stars all those with @xmath107 , indicated as thick dots ( in red in the online version ) , corresponding to a total of 694 stars .",
    "note that , as customary , negative values of the equivalent width indicate emission lines . since at temperatures @xmath108k or colours @xmath109 the sample could be contaminated by be stars that are evolving off the ms , there we set a more stringent condition on the equivalent width , namely @xmath110 .",
    "this limit is suggested by a survey of the h@xmath3 equivalent width of about 100 be stars in the galaxy ( cot & waters 1987 ) in which only one star is found with @xmath110  and the largest majority have values in the range from @xmath111  to @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in section[physi ] , all the objects with @xmath113k and an h@xmath3 excess above @xmath91 are most likely pms objects with masses around 3m@xmath7 .",
    "although we do not have spectroscopic observations of our stars to directly confirm our photometrically inferred equivalent widths , similar studies in the literature have demonstrated the success of this approach .",
    "white & ghez ( 2001 ) carried out a detailed study of 44 t tauri stars in binary systems in taurus ",
    "auriga , using both photometry and spectroscopy with the hst .",
    "their analysis shows that photometric and spectroscopic measurements of the equivalent width of the h@xmath3 emission line in these objects are in good agreement with one another .",
    "more recently , barentsen et al . (",
    "2011 ) carried out a h@xmath3 survey of t tauri stars in ic1396 , a region with considerable nebular emission .",
    "their photometric determination of @xmath101 for 109 objects in common with the spectroscopic survey of sicilia  aguilar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also shows an excellent agreement , particularly for stars with @xmath114 , which are the objects of interest in our study .",
    "when the bona - fide pms objects identified in the previous section are placed on the cmd ( see figure[fig5 ] ) , they clearly reveal two distinct groups made up of a similar number of objects .",
    "one is located above ( i.e. brighter and redder than ) the ms and thus is indicative of a population of young pms objects .",
    "this population was originally noticed by nota et al .",

    "( 2007 ) and sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , although these earlier works could only identify candidate young ( @xmath115myr ) pms stars since no information was available to verify and characterise the pms nature of each individual object .",

    "the physical parameters of the bona - fide pms stars that we have identified are obtained as explained in the following .",
    "the radius @xmath119 comes from the luminosity and effective temperature of the stars , which in turn follow from the observed colour @xmath120 and magnitude ( @xmath0 ) , properly corrected for interstellar extinction as explained in section[redde ] .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath121 and age were derived by comparing the location of each star in the hertzsprung ",
    "russell ( h  r ) diagram of figure[fig6 ] with the pms evolutionary tracks and corresponding isochrones , via interpolation over a finer grid than the one shown in the figure .",

    "r diagram , this procedure provides the probability distribution for each individual star to have a given value of the mass and age ( the method is conceptually identical to the one presented recently by da rio et al . 2010 ) .",
    "as for the theoretical models , we adopted those of the pisa group ( deglinnocenti et al . 2008 ; tognelli et al .",
    "2011 ) , for metallicity @xmath58 or about @xmath122 .",
    "these new pms tracks were specifically computed for the mass range from @xmath123m@xmath7to 5m@xmath7with an updated version of the franec evolutionary code ( see chieffi & straniero 1989 and deglinnocenti et al .",
    "2008 for details and cignoni et al .",
    "2009 for an application ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we opted for a lower value of the metallicity , namely @xmath58 in place of the more customarily adopted @xmath59 , because the corresponding tracks provide a better match to the observations , particularly where they reach the ms .",
    "as previously mentioned , @xmath58 is still compatible with the metallicity range found in the literature for the smc and is in any case better suited to ngc346 than the value adopted in previous studies of its pms population that made use of the evolutionary tracks of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for @xmath124 .",
    "figure[fig6 ] reveals that the masses of the bona - fine pms stars span over a decade , from @xmath125m@xmath7for the coolest objects to @xmath8m@xmath7for the hottest ones .",
    "as mentioned above , some of the objects with @xmath126k and @xmath127 could be be stars and we have marked all objects of this type with squares to distinguish them from the rest .",
    "figure[fig6 ] also provides a more quantitative characterisation of the age difference between the two populations of pms stars that we identified earlier in the cmd ( figure[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the isochrones in the figure , corresponding from right to left to ages of @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath61 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 and 32myr , show that the young population has a median age of @xmath9myr , whereas the older bona - fide pms stars span a wider age range from @xmath34myr to 30myr , with a broad peak around 20myr .",
    "we derived a reliable measure of the mass and age for all stars indicated as thick dots in figure[fig6 ] , except for the coolest objects that would have required a more uncertain extrapolation beyond the limits of the theoretical models .",
    "histograms with the mass and age distribution for the 680 stars measured in this way are shown in figures[fig7]a and [ fig7]b , respectively .",
    "as figure[fig6 ] already implied , the histogram in figure[fig7]b shows that there is a remarkable paucity of stars with ages around 48myr . in particular , the solid line in figure[fig7]b provides a histogram of the age distribution with constant logarithmic step ( a factor of 2 ) and shows two peaks , at @xmath130 and @xmath131myr",
    "the two peaks remain visible also when the number of stars in each bin is rescaled by the size of the bin , as indicated by the dot - dashed line ( note that at the extremes of the distribution it becomes more difficult to assign an age to the stars , so the first and last bin are drawn with a dotted line to indicate a larger uncertainty ) . in a companion paper ( de marchi , paresce & sabbi 2011 ) , we discuss the age and spatial distributions of these stars in more detail and show that between 30 and 10myr ago a large number of pms stars formed , similar to that produced by the current burst , which however appears to be much more intense .      besides the h@xmath3 luminosity @xmath77 already discussed in the previous section , the other physical parameters of interest in this work are the accretion luminosity @xmath4 and the mass accretion rate @xmath78 , that we derived following the procedure described in paperi . from an analysis of the literature values of @xmath4 and @xmath77 measurements as recently summarised by dahm ( 2008 ) for pms stars in the taurus ",
    "auriga association , that paper concluded that the ratio @xmath132 can be assumed to be constant .",
    "the proportionality constant , obtained from an elementary fit to the data in the compilation of dahm ( 2008 ) , is :    @xmath133    where the large uncertainty on the proportionality factor arises because the two quantities were determined from non - simultaneous observations .",
    "considering that the intensity of the h@xmath3 line from pms sequence stars is known to vary by about 20% on a time scale of a few hours and by as much as a factor of 2  3 in a few days ( e.g. fernandez et al .",
    "1995 ; smith et al . 1999 ; alencar et al . 2001 ) , the large spread can be understood . however , as we will show in section[evolu ] , the small dispersion of the mass accretion rate with stellar age suggests an uncertainty smaller than @xmath129 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is related to @xmath4 via the free - fall equation , that links the luminosity released in the impact of the accretion flow with the rate of mass accretion @xmath78 , according to the relationship :    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the gravitational constant , @xmath121 and @xmath119 the mass and photospheric radius of the star as derived above and @xmath136 the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "the value of @xmath136 is rather uncertain and depends on how exactly the accretion disc is coupled with the magnetic field of the star .",
    "following gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we adopt @xmath137 for all pms objects . by substituting equation[eq4 ] in equation[eq5 ] , the mass accretion rate @xmath78 , in units of m@xmath7  yr@xmath138 , can be directly expressed as a function of @xmath77 :    @xmath139    the histograms showing the distribution of @xmath77 and @xmath5 as derived with equation[eq6 ] for the 680 bona - fide pms stars with well defined masses are shown in figures[fig7]c and [ fig7]d , respectively .",
    "the median values of @xmath77 and @xmath140 are , respectively , @xmath141erg / s ( or @xmath142l@xmath27 ) and @xmath143m@xmath7  yr@xmath138 .",
    "the latter value is about 50% higher than the median mass accretion rate of a population of 133 pms stars that we detected in the field of sn1987a ( see paperi ) and this is fully consistent with the much younger average age of the pms stars in ngc346 .",
    "paperi provides an extensive discussion of the statistical and systematic uncertainties involved in determining @xmath78 with this method and we refer the reader to that work for more details .",
    "the typical combined statistical uncertainty on @xmath78 for the ngc346 field is 13% .",
    "it is largely dominated by the uncertainty on @xmath77 of 10% which in turn is mostly due to random errors in the photometry ( we note that this uncertainty is lower than for the study of the field around sn1987a in paperi because of the higher quality of the acs photometry ) . as for systematic effects , those on @xmath119 , @xmath121 and reddening",
    "add up to 15% , but it is the rather uncertain relationship linking @xmath77 to the accretion luminosity @xmath4 that plays a dominant role .",
    "we stress here that our method adopts the calibration provided by dahm ( 2008 ) , which is based on a spectroscopic study of galactic pms stars .",
    "if the uncertainty on the relationship between @xmath77 and @xmath4 is as large as dahm s ( 2008 ) work suggests ( but see section[evolu ] ) , it could possibly cause a systematic effect of up to a factor of 3 on the value of @xmath140 that we obtain .",
    "this is the unfortunate consequence of our incomplete understanding of the physics of the accretion process .",
    "improving this situation would require direct measurements of the bolometric accretion luminosity @xmath4 and simultaneous measurements of the hot continuum excess emission and of the emission line fluxes in h@xmath3 or other lines ( e.g. pa@xmath40 and br@xmath41 ) .",
    "it is also true , however , that these systematic effects plague in the same way all determinations of @xmath140 that make use of emission lines diagnostics .",
    "this includes detailed studies of the profile and intensity of the h@xmath3 line ( e.g. muzerolle et al . 1998 ) , since they rely on the same measurements for their calibration .",
    "therefore , it is possible and meaningful to compare the values of @xmath78 that we obtain here to one another and to those derived with other methods , as we do in the following section .",
    "in this section we investigate how @xmath78 varies with stellar parameters such as stellar mass and age .",
    "it is important to underline that this analysis is based only on stars that , at the time of the observations , were undergoing active mass accretion as revealed by h@xmath3 excess emission above our detection threshold .",
    "actually , pms objects are known to display large variations in their h@xmath3 emission over hours or days ( e.g. fernandez et al .",
    "1995 ; smith et al . 1999 ; alencar et al .",
    "2001 ) , with only about one third of them at any given time being active h@xmath3 emitters with @xmath144in the field around sn1987a ( panagia et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "in fact , a similar requirement of a high accretion activity is common to _ all _ studies in which pms stars are identified based on single - epoch observations , including those conducted spectroscopically on t tauri objects in the milky way ( e.g. sicilia  aguilar et al .",
    "this implies that the accretion rates measured for the detected objects will , in fact , represent the highest values possible for that class of objects , while many more stars may well be accreting at more modest rates . as a result , the true _",
    "average _ accretion rate appropriate for a given class of objects will be just a fraction of the values measured for the members of that class that can be detected .",
    "on the other hand , since all studies made with different techniques suffer from the same kind of selection on the accretion efficiency , a direct comparison between their results is still possible and meaningful .",
    "let s start with a qualitative analysis of the h ",
    "r diagram of the bona - fide pms stars shown in figure[fig8]a , where the size of the symbols is set to be proportional to @xmath78 according to the legend . besides the 680 bona - fide pms stars in ngc346 ( darker dots , red in the online version ) we have included in the figure for comparison also the 133 bona - fide pms stars in the field of sn1987a discussed in paperi ( lighter dots , gray in the online version ) .",
    "the theoretical pms isochrones are the same as shown in figure[fig6 ] and correspond to a metallicity @xmath58 and to ages from @xmath128myr to 32myr increasing from the right with a constant logarithmic step of a factor of 2 .",
    "while not directly applicable to the pms stars in the sn1987a field , due to the different metallicity , these isochrones serve nonetheless the purpose to illustrate the effects of increasing pms age .",
    "it is noteworthy that the mass accretion rate varies by over three orders of magnitude across the h ",
    "r diagram in a very regular way : younger stars , which are farther away from the ms , have typically higher mass accretion rates , as expected from the theory of stellar evolution . also the stellar mass appears to affect the value of @xmath78 , in the sense that less massive stars tend to have smaller accretion rates .",
    "it is also quite remarkable that even pms stars very close to the location of the zero - age ms ( zams ) , which for the masses of interest here can be considered equivalent to the 32myr pms isochrone , are still undergoing substantial mass accretion .    to verify that this is not a spurious effect due to errors in our derivation of @xmath78 , we show in figure[fig8]b the same h ",
    "r diagram but with the size of the symbols proportional to the measured h@xmath3 luminosity .",
    "there one sees that @xmath77 can be rather large for objects at or near the zams , suggesting that the accretion process remains relatively active when the star approaches the ms .",
    "more precisely , this demonstrates that , even if @xmath78 decreases as a pms star approaches the ms , its shrinking radius allows the star to extract more potential energy per unit rate of mass accretion ( i.e. for a given rate in gcm@xmath138 ) , thereby making the object easier to detect in h@xmath3 .",
    "finally , figure[fig8]c shows that the @xmath146 values of pms objects near or at the ms are typically much larger than those caused by chromospheric activity for stars in this mass range ( see e.g. ulmschneider 1979 ; pasquini et al .",
    "2000 ) , confirming that they are bona - fide young objects .      for a more quantitative analysis of the evolution of the mass accretion rate",

    "this sample is about five times larger than all @xmath78 measurements today available for galactic pms objects taken together ( e.g. sicilia  aguilar et al .",
    "furthermore , it spans over a decade in mass and two orders of magnitudes in age while including objects from the same star forming region with very accurate and uniform measurements .",
    "all this makes the sample particularly well suited for a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the mass accretion rate on stellar parameters .",
    "the dashed line in figure[fig9 ] represents the best fit to the evolution of the mass accretion rate in ngc346 , with a slope @xmath147 and intercept @xmath148 ( at 1 myr ) .",

    "this discrepancy had already been noticed in the field of sn1987a studied in paperi , although it is pointed out there that the @xmath140 value measured at 10myr is in excellent agreement with that of the most massive pms stars ( with spectral type g ) in the trumpler37 sample of sicilia  aguilar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) shown as large circles in the figure . even though the age of the g - type stars in trumpler37 is very uncertain ( sicilia  aguilar et al . 2006 ) and could be much younger ( j. muzerolle , priv .",
    "see also hartmann 2003 ) , we can not exclude that the slower decline of @xmath78 with time that we observe in ngc346 and around sn1987a could be due to the typically higher mass of our objects compared with that of the galactic t tauri stars that were the subject of recent studies .",
    "a dependence of @xmath78 on the stellar mass @xmath149 is indeed expected and could be as steep as @xmath150 according to muzerolle et al .",

    "but for stars in four mass groups , as indicated in each panel .",
    "we also provide the slope @xmath3 and intercept @xmath155 ( at 1myr ) of the best fits ( thick long - dashed lines ) .",
    "the thin short - dashed lines correspond to our @xmath77 detection limits , which appear to not significantly affect the determination of the slopes , except possibly for the least massive stars at ages @xmath157myr . ]    in principle , the shallower slopes of our fits could be affected by our very strict criteria for selecting bona - fide pms stars . requiring that the h@xmath3 excess be at the @xmath91 level or higher and that @xmath158  will set a lower limit to the h@xmath3 luminosity that we can accept as significant and , therefore , to the smallest @xmath78 value that we can detect at a given mass or age .",
    "if this lower limit is too high , we could be ignoring too many objects with low mass accretion rate , particularly at older ages , and therefore skew the measurement of the slope towards low values . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that our detection limits ( shown by the thin short - dashed lines for the average mass of each group ) do not significantly affect the determination of the slope , except possibly for the least massive stars at ages @xmath159myr . for this group , however , the slope is determined by the much more numerous young stars .",
    "more importantly , the upper envelopes of the distribution of all four mass groups appear to be fully consistent with the slope of the best fit .",
    "this is shown graphically by the thin long - dashed lines that represent the best - fitting line shifted vertically by @xmath61dex .",
    "while our conservative limits on the h@xmath3 excess emission may prevent us from detecting objects with low @xmath77 , no selection effects are to be expected for stars with high h@xmath3 luminosity .",
    "since the distribution of these objects is consistent with the slope of the best fit , the latter must be correct .",
    "therefore , within the uncertainties quoted in figure[fig10 ] , we can conclude that all four mass groups are compatible with the same slope @xmath160 ( formally @xmath161 ) .",
    "an interesting feature of figure[fig10 ] is that the spread of the @xmath162 data values around the best fitting lines is small , typically @xmath163dex ( rms ) .",
    "this proves quite convincingly that the true uncertainty in the relationship between @xmath164 and @xmath165 given by equation[eq4 ] can not be as large as the @xmath166dex value suggested by our elementary fit to the data in the compilation of dahm ( 2008 ) , but it has to be intrinsically smaller than the @xmath163dex factor that we observe in our own ngc346 data .",
    "we conservatively assume @xmath129dex ( or a factor of @xmath167 in linear units ) .",
    "having established that the data in all four panels of figure[fig10 ] are consistent with the same slope @xmath168 , we can use the intercept @xmath155 at 1myr to study how @xmath5 varies with the stellar mass @xmath15 .",
    "it appears that the value of @xmath155 in the four panels of figure[fig10 ] decreases with increasing mass approximately as @xmath169 .",
    "the formal uncertainty on @xmath155 may seem too large to reach this conclusion , but the scatter is due to the grouping of stars of different mass in the same bin .",
    "it is , therefore , more appropriate to perform a multivariate fit to the three variables simultaneously ( @xmath78 , age and mass ) .",

    "however , since the set of parameters @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 would give almost equally small residuals , we will take them hereafter as a good as well as convenient representation of the dependence of @xmath78 on stellar mass and age in ngc346 .",

    "@xmath181 takes on the values of @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively for ngc346 , the 30dor region and the galaxy .",
    "as already pointed out in paperi , the higher @xmath78 values of pms stars in the lmc compared to galactic objects of the same age could result from the lower metallicity of the clouds .",
    "the radiation pressure of the forming star is expected to be less strong on lower - metallicity disc material and this will delay the dissipation of the disc , thereby keeping the accretion process active for a longer time .",
    "this scenario is compatible with the pms stars in the galaxy having a smaller value of the specific mass accretion rate @xmath181 than those in the magellanic clouds .",
    "a possibility would be that the shallower photometric depth of the lmc data may cause the @xmath77 detection threshold for pms stars to be higher ( see paperiii for more details ) and thus could skew the median value of @xmath78 .",
    "we will address this possibility in detail through the analysis of recently obtained hst observations of the same region ( de marchi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . alternatively , it is also possible that below a certain metallicity threshold the radiation pressure on the disc material no longer changes .",
    "investigating this possibility requires the analysis of larger and homogeneous data set of @xmath78 measurements in low - metallicity environments .",
    "finally , we would like to highlight an interesting corollary result stemming from the large mass accretion rate values that we find for the objects in ngc346 . using the rates as expressed by equation[eq7 ]",
    "we can estimate the total mass accreted by a star over the time span from birth to the zams . already in 1993",
    "palla & stahler ( 1993 ) showed that the timescale to reach the zams is a strong function of the stellar mass .",

    ", there must be an appreciable fraction of pms objects that , at any given time , are not detectable as strong h@xmath3 emitters .",
    "therefore , in order to properly estimate the amount of accreted mass over the pms phase we have to make allowance for the appropriate duty cycle . while doing this would require a detailed knowledge of the time evolution of the h@xmath3 emission for a large sample of pms stars in this region , for the sake of simplicity we will assume that the evolution consists in a series of two - level transitions that recur in time .",
    "in this simplified model the high state value corresponds to the average value measured for the detected pms stars and the low state of the h@xmath3 undetected stars is zero .",
    "thus , the true mass accretion rate of any star of mass @xmath15 at the time @xmath14 will simply be the average value measured for the detected pms stars multiplied by an efficiency factor @xmath188 that in principle is a function of the stellar mass , the time and the metallicity of the region .",
    "an approximate value of this function is given by the ratio of the number of pms stars with detected h@xmath3 emission and the total number of candidate pms stars as defined by their location in the h  r diagram . in a companion paper ,",
    "de marchi , panagia & sabbi ( 2011 ) show that for ngc346 such a ratio is essentially constant over time up to pms ages of 8myr at a level of @xmath189 .",
    "note that similar values have been found in the field of sn1987a for pms stars with median age of 14myr ( @xmath190 ; panagia et al 2000 ) . therefore , adopting a constant value of @xmath191 for pms stars in ngc346 allows us to integrate the accretion rate over time from 0 up to @xmath192 in order to estimate the total amount of mass ( in m@xmath7units ) accreted by these objects during their pms phase . from equations[eq7 ] and 8 we can express it in units of m@xmath7as follows :    @xmath193    showing that the amount of accreted mass is virtually insensitive to the stellar mass . in the range",

    "if this is the case , the pms evolution of moderate - mass stars , say @xmath198m@xmath7 , should be reconsidered and recalculated taking into account the high @xmath78 values .",
    "one of the effects of equation9 is that the appropriate @xmath192 for a star that reaches the ms with a given mass will be longer than the value estimated by evolutionary models that assume @xmath199 after the first few @xmath200yr ( e.g. baraffe et al .",
    "since the star had an appreciably lower mass for a very long time ( several myr ) at the early epochs , it was necessarily evolving more slowly .    extrapolating these findings to lower masses than those that we have reached here ( i.e. @xmath201m@xmath7 ) would carry the implication that no star could form with a mass below a suitable minimum value . for ngc346 this would correspond to a lower cut - off of the initial mass function at @xmath202m@xmath7 . in the milky way , where @xmath78 is about five times lower but the metallicity is about 8 times higher so that the pms evolutionary times are a factor of about @xmath203 longer",
    ", the cut - off would occur at @xmath204m@xmath7 .    on the other hand , it is also possible that for low - mass stars circumstellar discs are eroded in a finite time that is appreciably shorter than their @xmath192 .",
    "for example , if for stars below 1m@xmath7we were to limit the integrals in equation9 between 0 and the smaller of @xmath192 and 20myr , the accreted mass would decrease proportionally to the mass , i.e.    @xmath205    in practice this would still require some refinements to models of stellar evolution in the pms phase , but the increase in mass would never be higher than 20% of the final zams mass . note that the choice of 20myr as the upper limit for the integration stems from the fact that near the ms we still find 1m@xmath7stars that have strong h@xmath3 excess , thus indicating the presence of considerable accretion .",
    "deeper observations of ngc346 reaching well below 1m@xmath7on the ms can easily show whether the discs of lower - mass objects are indeed eroded before they reach the zams",
    ". it would be sufficient to verify whether strong h@xmath3 excess emission is still shown by stars smaller than 1m@xmath7near the ms , or , alternatively , whether for objects of these lower masses strong h@xmath3 emission is only seen at younger ages , when they are still well above the ms .",
    "if at these masses the discs are indeed eroded before reaching the zams , h@xmath3 emission should systematically taper off for objects older than a cut - off age . in any case",
    ", these new results can have important implications for some of the assumptions and boundary conditions used in theories of star formation and early evolution .",
    "we have studied the properties of the stellar populations in the field of the ngc346 cluster in the smc as observed with the acs camera on board the hubble space telescope ( sabbi et al .",
    "to this aim , we have employed a novel , self - consistent method that allows us to reliably identify pms stars undergoing active mass accretion , regardless of their age .",
    "the method , fully described in paperi , does not require spectroscopy and combines broad - band @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry with narrow - band @xmath2 imaging to identify all stars with excess h@xmath3 emission and allows us to derive the accretion luminosity @xmath4 and mass accretion rate @xmath78 for all of them .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarised as follows .    1 .   from the photometry of sabbi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we have selected all objects in a region of @xmath48 around the centre of ngc346 that have a combined mean error @xmath50 in the three bands ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and h@xmath3 ) of less than @xmath51mag , as defined in equation[eq1 ] .",
    "a total of 18764 stars satisfy this condition .",
    "2 .   the cmd reveals the presence of both young and old populations , but the conspicuous broadening of the upper ms proves that there is also variable extinction .",
    "we have determined the reddening towards each of these stars from their colour and magnitude displacements with respect to a 4myr isochrone for metallicity @xmath58 and a distance modulus of @xmath206 .",
    "we found that extinction is in the range @xmath207 or @xmath208 ( respectively 17% and 83% limits ) , with a median value of @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "we have then used the reddening values towards each of the selected stars to derive a reddening correction for all objects in their vicinity .",
    "3 .   following the method developed in paperi ,",
    "we have identified 791 pms candidates as being objects with h@xmath3 excess above the @xmath91 level with respect to the reference provided by normal stars .",
    "their average h@xmath3 luminosity is @xmath96ergs@xmath138 or @xmath97l@xmath27 .",
    "we have also determined the equivalent width of the h@xmath3 emission line of these objects and have classified as bona - fide pms stars all those with @xmath158  ( or @xmath209  for stars with @xmath126k ) .",
    "these conditions guarantee that our sample is free from contamination due to the chromospheric activity of older objects or to the rotational winds of be stars .",
    "a total of 694 objects satisfy these conditions .",
    "4 .   by comparing the locations of these objects in the h ",
    "r diagram with the pms evolutionary models of the pisa group for metallicity @xmath58 , we have been able to derive an accurate value of the mass and age of 680 bona - fide pms stars ( note that previous determinations of these parameters for candidate pms stars in ngc346 that made use of evolutionary models for @xmath124 are necessarily less accurate ) .",
    "the masses of these objects range from @xmath194m@xmath7to @xmath210m@xmath7 , with an average value of @xmath9m@xmath7 .",
    "their ages show a clear bimodal distribution with two peaks at @xmath9myr and @xmath12myr and very few objects around @xmath118myr , revealing the presence of two distinct but equally populous generations of stars .",
    "we address in a companion paper ( de marchi , panagia & sabbi 2011 ) the properties of and the relationships between the two generations .",
    "5 .   from the h@xmath3 luminosity and the other physical parameters that we have measured ,",
    "we have derived the mass accretion rate @xmath5 of all bona - fide pms stars .",
    "the median value of @xmath78 is @xmath143m@xmath7yr@xmath138 .",
    "this value is about 50% higher than that measured in paperi for a population of 133 pms stars in the field of sn1987a , owing to the much younger median age of pms objects in ngc346 .",
    "thanks to the unprecedented size of our pms sample and of its spread in mass and age , we have been able to study the evolution of the mass accretion rate as a function of stellar parameters . regardless of the mass of the star , our analysis shows that the mass accretion rate decreases with roughly the square root of the age , or about three times slower than predicted by current models of viscous disc evolution , and that more massive stars have systematically higher mass accretion rate in proportion to their mass .",
    "a multivariate linear regression fit reveals that @xmath211 , where @xmath14 is the age of the star , @xmath15 its mass and @xmath16 a quantity that is higher at lower metallicity .",
    "the large mass accretion rates that we find imply that a considerable amount of mass is accreted during the pms phase , at least in low - metallicity environments such as the magellanic clouds . at face value",
    ", the observed rates integrated over the entire pms phase would give a total accreted mass of @xmath17m@xmath7 , with negligible dependence of the final mass on the zams , thereby possibly suggesting a lower cut - off mass in the stellar mass function of ngc346 .",
    "if , however , the circumstellar discs are eroded on a time scale shorter than the pms lifetime , the total accreted mass will be of course smaller but not negligible .",
    "in any case , the pms evolution of moderate - mass stars ( @xmath212m@xmath7 ) should be reconsidered and recalculated taking into account the high @xmath78 values , since for a given ms mass the evolutionary time needed to reach the zams will be longer than what is currently estimated by models that assume @xmath199 after the first few @xmath200yr .",
