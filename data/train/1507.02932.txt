    "for fast rotations there is a proliferation of vortices , and simultaneously the resistance @xmath115 diminishes as @xmath116 , which gives a linear relation .",

    "a variety of vortex positions are required . to achieve this in the most controlled fashion , pinning of the vortices at a given location",
    "is desirable .",
    "vortex - antivortex pairs may be reliably generated and pinned at a desired location by the use of two blue - detuned lasers moved through the bec @xcite .",
    "once the vortices are generated , the density distribution of the bec is estimated using high - resolution spatial imaging techniques such as scanning electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "other _ in - situ _ methods such as as phase contrast imaging could be used to obtain a density distribution of the bec to identify the vortex positions @xcite .",
    "the total current @xmath121 can be extracted from the high - resolution velocity distribution of the bec , which can performed by bragg spectroscopy @xcite or time - of - flight imaging @xcite .    in order to measure the conductance plateaus",

    "thus during the measurement process , only the relative position and momentum distributions are required .",
    "the ratio @xmath125 is then extracted by looking at the differential variation of the current @xmath126 with variations of the vortex position @xmath127 .",
    "the spatial measurement then plays the role of obtaining @xmath128 , i.e. the relative density of the condensate at @xmath64-coordinate of the vortex .",

    "since the conductance @xmath139 is quantized in units of @xmath140 , our result presents the possibility of an novel method of measuring the mass of atoms in the condensate .",
    "we note that this would be a mass spectrometer that would be able to measure the _ absolute _ mass of the atoms , rather than the _ relative _ atomic mass . currently penning traps are the most precise mass spectrometers @xcite achieving relative uncertainties of typically @xmath141 for the relative atom mass .",
    "the ( absolute ) atomic mass unit is known to an larger uncertainty of @xmath142 @xcite .",

    "the quantity @xmath144 itself is of interest in the context of determination of the fine structure constant , by combining estimates of the rydberg constant , the relative mass of an atom , and @xmath144 @xcite .",

    "the spatial and velocity distribution measurement methods both have a finite resolution which may appear to severely limit the precision of the quantities to be estimated in ( [ normrelation ] ) . however , bulk quantities such as @xmath147 scale well with finite resolution , e.g. for simpson s rule the errors scale as the fourth power of the discretization . for @xmath148 , assuming that the vortex is pinned by the blue - detuned laser so that it is always present at the same location , then one can measure the relative density with high accuracy by many repetitions of the experiment . to minimize the uncertainty of the density measurement it is advantageous to move the vortex in the vicinity of the maximum density of the bec , where the derivative with position is zero , i.e. @xmath149 . in this way errors due to finite resolution can be mitigated .",
    "this is also advantageous in terms of corrections to the current due to the vortex ( see appendix [ sec : corrections ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath127 can be set by the pinning laser which is controlled and hence is not measured directly in the bec .",
    "we therefore estimate that the main sources of error will arise from density and thermal fluctuations in the bec , and other experimental issues such as calibration of measured and controlled quantities , and repeatability .",
    "although it is ultimately an experimental question of whether sufficiently low uncertainties can be attained , at the level of the system the topological nature of the observable should make the measurement of @xmath139 rather robust under a variety of conditions , in analogy with the standard qhe .",
    "in summary , we have shown an alternative method of investigating integer quantum hall physics using becs with small numbers of vortices . while this approach does not have a precise mathematical equivalence of previous approaches @xcite",
    ", much of the essential physics is in common , where the topological phase around the vortices give rise to a quantized hall conductance - like quantity . in both cases the current response along the channel",

    "the density at the same @xmath64-coordinate as the vortex can be measured instead of the asymmetry parameter .",
    "a potential application is to use the quantization of the conductance in units of @xmath150 as a novel way of measuring the absolute mass of the atoms , using a topological invariant of the system .",
    "while in this paper we have implicitly assumed an atomic bec , other types of bec , such as exciton - polaritons @xcite , should also be suitable to observe the effect as the effect relies only on the topological phase of the condensate .",

    "one approach to a mass standard is to define 1 kg to be equal to a certain number of carbon-12 atoms .",
    "however , there is already the definition that 1 mole ( @xmath177 , avogadro s number ) of carbon-12 is 12 grams exactly .",
    "this means that when the kilogram is redefined the constraint @xmath178 must also be satisfied , where @xmath179 is the mass of 1 carbon-12 atom ( in kg ) .",
    "currently , both @xmath180 and @xmath179 are experimentally determined quantities . in a redefinition of the kilogram using carbon atoms ,",
    "the avogadro constant would be fixed to a particular number , for example @xmath181 exactly .",
    "then according to the constraint ( [ carbonconstraint ] ) this fixes @xmath179 also exactly .",
    "alternatively , @xmath179 could also be fixed , and this would fix @xmath180 according to ( [ carbonconstraint ] ) . fixing @xmath179 or @xmath180 is equivalent in this sense .    a very precise measurement of the mass of the atoms",
    "can therefore equivalently contribute towards the mass standard . while a bec of carbon-12 is not practical , the relation ( [ carbonconstraint ] ) can be converted to something more convenient for this purpose . introducing the mass of the atom species that undergoes bec @xmath2 ( such as @xmath182rb ) we have @xmath183",
    "the relative mass ratio @xmath184 can be measured very precisely ( typically @xmath145 relative error ) using penning traps @xcite . in this way by measuring the ( absolute ) mass of the bec atom , this can be used to determine the avogradro constant , which defines the mass standard ."
