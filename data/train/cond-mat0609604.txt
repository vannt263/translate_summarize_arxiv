    "systems of interacting bosons and fermions occur frequently in nature . usually , the bosons act as carriers of force between the fermionic particles . in high energy physics ,",
    "quarks exchange gluons via the strong force , while in solid state physics electrons can interact via light or lattice vibrations .",
    "most prominent examples of such systems are conventional bcs superconductivity ( caused by an effective attractive interaction between the fermions induced by the electron - phonon coupling ) , the peierls instability ( a charge density wave ) and the formation of polarons , which in solids are electrons dressed by a cloud of phonons .",
    "there are only a few condensed matter systems in which the influence of fermions onto bosons has been investigated .",
    "one of them are mixtures of bosonic @xmath2he and fermionic @xmath3he , in which a shift of the transition temperature between normal and superfluid @xmath2he as a function of @xmath3he concentration was observed .    in the field of ultracold gases fermions and bosons",
    "are on an equal footing .",
    "the choice of different atomic species @xcite , the use of feshbach resonances @xcite and optical lattice potentials @xcite give almost unrestricted access to all parameters of these systems , offering the possibility to study the influence of the species onto each other and to investigate open questions from other areas of physics in a new context .",
    "theoretical approaches  @xcite have proposed a whole variety of quantum phases present in homogeneous bose - fermi mixtures at low temperature , ranging from a charge - density wave , over a fermionic pairing phase , to polaronic properties , and even to phase separation .    in recent experiments",
    "two groups independently succeeded in the stabilization of bosonic @xmath0rb and fermionic @xmath1k in a three - dimensional optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "they focused on the loss of bosonic phase coherence and on the increase of the bosonic density by varying the fermionic concentration .",
    "the trapping potential and the finite temperature make the interpretation of the observed quantities however challenging .    here",
    ", we study the interplay of a trap , finite temperature and strong interparticle interactions , which lead to physics quite different from the homogeneous case . in particular , while the addition of fermions induces a quantum phase transition from the mott insulating to the superfluid phase at larger bosonic repulsion strength in a homogeneous lattice , the presence of a trapping potential makes the situation more involved because of an extra , effective strongly - inhomogeneous trapping potential . despite the large bose - fermi coupling",
    ", it turns out that our results for the trapped , mixed system can be well understood in terms of first and second order corrections to the bosonic hamiltonian . for low bosonic and fermionic densities ,",
    "we illustrate that the formation of bound pairs invalidates the picture of a perturbational correction by the fermions on the bosons .",
    "a mixture of bosonic and spin - polarized fermionic atoms in an optical lattice can be described by the bose - fermi hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the corresponding creation and annihilation operators for the fermions ( bosons ) , and @xmath7 is the number operator on site @xmath8 for species x = b , f .",

    "in a mixture , the lowest order effect of the fermions is a mean - field shift @xmath34 of the potential experienced by the bosons @xcite . in a homogeneous system with a fixed particle number",
    "the shift in the potential has no consequences besides adding a constant to the energy .",
    "the next order effect is an induced attractive interaction between the bosons @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is well known from conventional superconductivity , where the phonons ( bosons ) induce an effective electron - electron interaction .",

    "we observe that the density profiles are quite well reproduced , confirming that the dominant effect of the fermions is to modify the effective potential for the bosons .",

    "[ fig : zero](a ) ) .",
    "we note that the visibilities , discussed below , are rather well reproduced in the approximation , indicating that the effective potential is the dominant effect as far as this experimental quantity is concerned ( which is surprising seen the large values of @xmath12 ) .",
    "having gained an understanding of the relevant mechanisms , we proceed in section  [ subsec : sim ] with the results of two simulations where we vary experimental control parameters , namely the bose - fermi coupling and the fermionic concentration , and then compare our results to experiment in section  [ subsec : exp ] .",

    "[ fig : ubf ] ) , despite their light bare mass .",

    "the effect of an inhomogeneous effective potential can be seen even more clearly by varying the fermionic concentration instead of the interaction strength @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : concentration ] we show the dependence of the bosonic visibility on the number of fermions with a fixed number of bosons , a setup similar to recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "the bosonic visibility is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the value of the bosonic momentum distribution at momentum @xmath45 .",
    "the visibility is often taken as a measure of the coherence of the bosons .     as a function of fermionic number for a system of @xmath46 sites , @xmath47 bosons and inverse temperature @xmath48 for optical potentials @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 , respectively ) .",
    "the inset shows the bosonic density profiles at @xmath27 for @xmath51 bottom to top in the trap center . ]    for shallow lattice potentials , a slight increase in the visibility for an intermediate number of fermions is seen , due to an increase in the bosonic density in the center of the trap caused by the fermions . for moderate lattice potentials",
    "one observes a complex , non - monotonic behavior with large variations .",
    "if a few fermions are admixed to a bosonic system , the fermions  spreading over several sites in the center of the trap  cause a strongly inhomogeneous effective potential for the bosons .",
    "the effective potential exhibits a deep minimum in the center of the trap and causes the bosons to accumulate in this region . if the purely bosonic system was superfluid ( cf .",
    "[ fig : concentration ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) the effective potential causes a superfluid state with higher filling in the center of the trap , _ slightly increasing _ the bosonic visibility . if the bosonic system exhibited a broad @xmath54 mott plateau ( cf .",

    ", the effective potential induced by the fermions follows the curvature of the external trap over the region occupied by the fermions with a sudden increase at its boundaries .",

    "[ fig : concentration ] ) , the experiments  @xcite show a strong _ decrease _ for moderate values of the lattice potential . assuming that entropy is conserved when ramping up the lattice , the effective temperature of a @xmath0rb -@xmath1k mixture rises dramatically because of the different temperature dependence of fermionic ( @xmath59 for an ideal gas ) and bosonic ( @xmath60 for an ideal gas ) contribution to the entropy  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperature ] , we increase the temperature ( decrease @xmath61 ) at fixed optical potential and atom number and find a drastic drop in the visibility as the temperature is increased around @xmath62 .",

    "bound pairs ( `` molecules '' ) of one boson and one fermion _ can _ now be formed for moderately deep optical lattices .",
    "first signs of this pairing can be seen in the two - body bose - fermi momentum distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron ] ( a ) .",
    "the momentum distribution of these fermionic molecules shows a sharper fermi edge compared to the bare fermion .",
    "it also tends to zero at larger momenta , showing that these molecules are a better description of the system than the bare fermions and bosons .",
    "the formation of molecules is also well supported by coinciding charge modulations in the bosonic and fermionic densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron](b ) ) . for the parameters chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron](b ) the density modulations are friedel oscillations due to trap , but for larger lattice depths a density wave can be formed @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have simulated the trapped one - dimensional bose - fermi hubbard model .",
    "the interplay between temperature , trap , optical potential and particle number is very rich and non - universal .",
    "the dominant effect is the creation of a strongly inhomogeneous trapping potential by the fermions . in higher order",
    "the fermions induce an attractive interaction between the bosons , which should lead to an increase in the bosonic visibility . however assuming a rise in temperature when ramping up the lattice , a decrease in the visibility is found analogous to the experimental observation in the @xmath0rb -@xmath1k samples .",
    "if temperature remains low , one could observe a mott transition driven by the fermionic concentration , and observe the formation of molecules .",
    "the same effects are expected for higher dimensions , since the underlying mechanisms do not depend on dimensionality .",
