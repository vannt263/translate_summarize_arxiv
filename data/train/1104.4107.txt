    "adoption of the innovation occurs when an individual reaches the highest awareness value @xmath2 .",
    "the population evolves by repeated interactions between two random individuals . in each interaction with an adopter , someone with awareness @xmath3 advances to awareness @xmath4 , while there are no state changes when two non - adopters interact . in our _ innovation model _ , an innovation is adopted permanently ; in our _ fad model _ , an adopter abandons the fad at a rate @xmath10 so that it eventually becomes pass .",
    "we begin with the simplest situation of no reinforcement @xcite , namely , a population with two classes of individuals : susceptible ( state 0 ) and adopters ( state 1 ) . whenever a susceptible individual and an adopter meet , the former is converted to an adopter via @xmath12 .",
    "the rate equations that give the evolution of a homogeneous and well - mixed population ( the mean - field limit ) are : @xmath13 we generically assume that the evolution begins with a small fraction of adopters in an otherwise susceptible population : @xmath14 , @xmath15 . for this initial condition",
