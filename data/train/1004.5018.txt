    "there has been considerable interest in the problem of hamiltonian identification through indirect probing , thereby developing various quantum mechanical versions of classical system tomography or classical ` inverse scattering ' problems  @xcite . for certain types of interactions ,",
    "it was found @xcite that only few resources are required to obtain an accurate model of the system .",
    "indirect hamiltonian estimation is therefore an interesting problem for both pragmatic purposes and fundamental insights .",
    "we are interested in the following questions : how can we obtain precise information about a hamiltonian under restricted access ? what can we learn about the ` inside ' of a large system by only looking at a subsystem of it ? under which conditions is such indirect probing possible ?",
    "indirect _ classical _ system tomography of a quadratic hamiltonian . in this example , the spring constants @xmath0 and masses @xmath1 of a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators can be determined by monitoring the dynamics of a single particle at the end ( in red ) .",
    "see @xcite for details . ]",
    "recent studies have focused on this problem for cases of chains and networks of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "the common question addressed can be formulated as follows : can we estimate all parameters , such as coupling strengths and local fields , by accessing only one or a few spins ?",
    "it should be emphasised that even _ direct _",
    "hamiltonian estimation , or more generally , process tomography , is hard , because the required number of measurements and the complexity of the post - processing both scale exponentially with the system size",
    ". however , in realistic situations , we usually have a priori knowledge based on the underlying physics .",
    "it has been shown that such knowledge can be used to develop compressed sensing protocols  @xcite , which greatly reduce the complexity of process tomography .",
    "various works on indirect hamiltonian estimation have relied on similar assumptions ; namely , that the dynamics is restricted to a subspace of polynomial dimension @xcite . in @xcite , the efficiency of the estimation in terms of the required time and the number of measurements is discussed .",
    "an interesting example that does not rely on a subspace was analysed by di franco et al .",
    "we will see here that this is a special case of the generic estimation of quadratic hamiltonians , which can be estimated efficiently due to a simple description of their dynamics in the heisenberg picture .",
    "di franco also found that the estimation is quite robust against noise @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the 1d methods were generalised to arbitrary graphs , and the possible elimination of degeneracies was discussed .",
    "also , wiesniak and markiewicz @xcite went beyond the simplest subspace in order to study quasi-1d systems .",
    "table [ tab : overview - of - indirect ] summarises the results obtained so far in terms of the settings and assumptions considered .",
    ".[tab : overview - of - indirect]overview of indirect hamiltonian estimation schemes .",
    "the interaction types represent the pauli matrices involved in the spin - spin coupling , e.g. , @xmath2 stands for a hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , the analysis of physically important cases , such as the transverse ising model and the xy model with a magnetic field , have remained open .",
    "solutions to both cases will be presented in this work .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to develop a method to perform indirect quantum tomography for many - body systems of identical particles . even though the method is analogous to the spin case",
    ", the hamiltonians considered here have a higher number of parameters , and it is surprising that they can still be estimated in a similar fashion .",
    "the class of hamiltonians we study here is those of quadratic form in bosonic or fermionic operators .",
    "there has been tremendous progress in experiments of quantum random walks  @xcite , optical lattices  @xcite , coupled cavities  @xcite , nano - mechanical oscillators  @xcite , etc . , which can be modelled by such quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "thus , the indirect estimation scheme we present here will be of use in reducing the necessary resources for modelling such systems . for the case of bosons , it is the most direct translation of the work by gladwell  @xcite to the quantum case .",
    "gladwell studied how the spring constants and masses of coupled classical harmonic oscillator chains can be estimated by looking at the movement of only one particle ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram.-1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , our estimation protocol gives a natural generalisation of the problems on spin chains , since quadratic hamiltonians of fermions also describe a certain class of spin systems , such as the transverse ising model .",
    "the main method of indirect estimation is summarised as follows .",
    "first , the system is initialised to an arbitrary but fixed state",
    ". this can be , for example , even a thermal state , and can occur on slow time - scales via relaxation .",
    "then , some simple single - particle properties are initialised and measured at a later time",
    ". finally , the accumulated data is fourier transformed , and the parameters are extracted through a set of linear equations . this simple method is outlined in fig . [",
    "fig : diagram .",
    "] for the 1d case",
    ".    schematic overview of our estimation scheme for a chain of length @xmath4 the main requirements are ( i ) relatively fast single - qubit rotations and measurements on the first site , and ( ii ) a decoherence time of at least @xmath5 ]    the procedure is analogous to an ` inverse scattering ' problem because the perturbation introduced in one edge of the sample ( e.g. , rotation of the first qubit ) propagates through the sample , ` scattering ' with the inner structure of the hamiltonian , and then this information encodes the structure of the system . while it is obvious that this procedure provides _ some",
    "_ information on the system , the surprising result here is that _ all _ information can be uniquely identified .",
    "since we obtain information on anisotropies as well , not only the coupling strengths but also the type of interaction can be determined by our method .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the necessary notation for quadratic hamiltonians and some techniques for their diagonalisations .",
    "since these are well established methods , we will only discuss them as a ` recipe ' for the estimation procedure .",
    "we then discuss the simplest case of estimation , namely when the system is a chain of hopping particles , and later generalise it to arbitrary graphs .",
    "finally we discuss how the results apply to 1d chains of spins and conclude .",
    "the most general quadratic hamiltonian of @xmath6 indistinguishable particles is written as@xmath7 where the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are creation and annihilation operators and @xmath10 are matrices describing the parameters we would like to estimate .",
    "for @xmath11 to be hermitian we must have @xmath12 and @xmath13 where we introduced the parameter @xmath14 for fermions and @xmath15 for bosons .",
    "we will mostly follow the notation of @xcite , though we shall write all vectors in dirac notation . at first , we put all hamiltonian parameters into the hermitian @xmath16 matrix    @xmath17    and introduce the column vector operator @xmath18 so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_original ] ) can be expressed up to a constant as @xmath19 throughout this paper , we make two technical assumptions : first , all the _ phases _ of @xmath20 are assumed to be known .",
    "although some phases might be easy to determine , this requires complicated studies of gauge invariance that do not seem to be worthwhile , as in many practical cases all elements are real and positive .",
    "second , for the bosonic case we assume that the matrix @xmath21 is _ positive definite_. again , in principle this can be generalised , but this way we avoid technical difficulties of symplectic transformations @xcite .    as in @xcite",
    "the efficiency of our method depends on how many entries of @xmath21 are a priori known to be zero ; that is , on knowledge of the coupling graph . if such knowledge is not available , we have to perform measurements on all but one of the qubits . if the graph is known to be highly sparse ( for instance a chain ) we only need to access a single qubit . but before going into the details of hamiltonian identification , let us briefly review the diagonalisation of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_original ] ) and thus the dynamics , introducing some notations . for more detailed descriptions on the diagonalisation procedure , see , e.g. , @xcite .    for quadratic hamiltonians of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_original ] ) , there exist quasi - particle creation and annihilation operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with which the hamiltonian can be represented by the simple form of non - interacting modes , @xmath24 for this reason , quadratic hamiltonians are also referred to as ` quasi - free ' interactions .",
    "we need to know the transformation @xmath25 that maps the operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 for particles to @xmath28 and @xmath29 for quasi - particles , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 in order to ensure the canonical commutation relations for the operators @xmath33 and @xmath22 , @xmath25 must satisfy @xmath34 , where @xmath35 the hamiltonian is now written as @xmath36 it can then be shown that @xmath37 is diagonalised by @xmath25 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , to have the desired form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_diag ] ) .",
    "note that the energy eigenvalues appear in pairs of positive @xmath40 and negative @xmath41 values @xmath42    the matrix @xmath25 consists of the _ right eigenvectors _",
    "@xmath43 of @xmath37 as@xmath44 and the inverse of @xmath25 is given by@xmath45 for bosons , the matrix @xmath37 is not hermitian and the distinction between right and left eigenvectors is necessary .",
    "this gives rise to a few further peculiarities , such as the modified normalisation and completeness relationship ( see below ) .",
    "fortunately , in this work we are solving an _ inverse problem , _ and do not have to discuss how to find these vectors and how numerically stable the corresponding algorithms are .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the @xmath43 are not representing physical states but just introduced here as a part of solving the heisenberg equation of motion for the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the completeness relationship is given by@xmath46 and the vectors @xmath43 are chosen to fulfil the normalisation relationship@xmath47    for convenience , let us also introduce vectors @xmath48 as the canonical basis vectors : @xmath49 due to the structure of the matrix @xmath50 the upper and lower eigenvectors of @xmath37 are related as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the addition modulo @xmath53 the dynamics of the original operators @xmath54 can be found from @xmath55 as @xmath56 where we have introduced a sign function @xmath57 through@xmath58",
    "let us first consider a 1d chain of interacting particles , meaning that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are tridiagonal . also assume that we can initialise the chain in a fixed state @xmath61 this state could , for instance , be a thermal state , but we do not require to have the exact form of @xmath62 : we just have to be able to repeatedly initialise the chain to the same state @xmath62 . as before  @xcite",
    ", we perform initialisations followed by measurements at the first site . the quantity we need to measure at the first site is @xmath63 for different times up to @xmath64 @xcite . in order to eradicate the dependence on the initial state @xmath65 we measure two sequences of @xmath66 after preparing the first site to give two different initial values , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . using @xmath69 and thus @xmath70 , and subtracting the measurement results",

    "( [ eq : meas1 ] ) , the dependence on the initial state is completely removed .",
    "this is thanks to the absence of the interactions between particles : they ( almost ) do not see each other , so the information on the ` injected ' particle can be extracted by subtracting the influence from others .    for the spin chain case the eigenfrequencies are non - degenerate and @xmath73 @xcite . for the present case of quadratic hamiltonians we were unable to prove this , but could confirm it numerically .",
    "hence , a fourier analysis provides us with the frequencies @xmath40 and the amplitudes @xmath74 summing these amplitudes gives the value of @xmath75@xmath76 where we used the completeness relationship eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete ] ) . equation  ( [ eq : meas1 ] ) still contains mixtures of the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 we can separate them by measuring another pair of initialisations @xmath79 as long as @xmath80 we can solve the linear equation for @xmath81 without loss of generality , we choose @xmath82 by arranging the global phase of each eigenstate @xmath43 . in conclusion , a few random rotations or initialisations of the first qubit , followed by measurements , provide us with @xmath40 and @xmath83    let us now describe how to obtain the parameters of @xmath21 from this observed data .",
    "we have to distinguish between the generic case where the off - diagonal couplings @xmath84 and @xmath85 are distinct , and the special case where they are equal .      as we have seen above , what we diagonalised is the @xmath16 matrix @xmath37 , so it is helpful to regard @xmath21 as a representation of a graph consisting of @xmath86 nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingmatrix ] ) .",
    "its off - diagonal entries correspond to the coupling strengths between nodes , whereas the diagonal elements represent the intensity of the ` field ' at each node .",
    "the matrix @xmath21 as a coupling graph on the nodes @xmath87,width=415 ]    we can then start with a recursive algorithm similar to @xcite by applying @xmath21 to the localised states at sites 1 and @xmath88 @xmath89 using these equations for @xmath90 and @xmath91 we arrive at    @xmath92    note that @xmath93 for fermions . among these parameters",

    "however , similar to the original work by gladwell @xcite and the spin chain case , @xcite , we can use the normalisation of the eigenstates . in this case , it is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) . summing up the mod squares of the above equations , the dependencies on @xmath99 and @xmath100 vanishes and we can infer the absolute value of each coefficient , i.e. , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . if @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104 by dividing the above two equations and then through @xmath105 both @xmath106 and @xmath107 are obtained . because the phases of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are known , then we learn @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we can then express a similar set of equations for the next site @xmath110 and @xmath111 by induction , we then see that all matrix elements of @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be obtained , as desired .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the scheme works even though the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingmatrix ] is not infecting  @xcite .",
    "we will now look at the cases with equal off - diagonal couplings in more detail , because such physical systems are often encountered , e.g. , transverse ising for fermions , coupled harmonic oscillators for bosons .      when @xmath112 the above method fails .",
    "this is the case for interacting harmonic oscillators without the rotating wave approximation  @xcite and for quantum ising models , and therefore of interest in a number of practical situations .",
    "we focus on the case where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are real , e.g. , @xmath113 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath114 and @xmath115 are always different if there is a transverse field ( fermions ) or if the masses are finite ( bosons ) , so it is reasonable to assume @xmath116 ( the ising model without transverse field can not be estimated using our method because excitations do not propagate ) .    it is convenient to introduce@xmath117 a simple calculation then shows that @xmath118 where we set @xmath119 in some sense , this is similar to a 1d chain case . as the elements @xmath120 are already known , we learn @xmath94 and @xmath95 from@xmath121 which can also be written in terms of the known variables by inserting the completeness relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : complete ] ) . using @xmath122 and normalisation",
    "we obtain @xmath108 and @xmath123 for bosons , we then obtain @xmath124 through the completeness relation , followed by @xmath125 through @xmath126 and finally @xmath127 by completeness again . on the other hand ,",
    "for fermions,@xmath128 and through normalisation we obtain @xmath129 and @xmath130 knowing all parameters at site @xmath131 we can then proceed through induction . for the most general case , we can also allow for chains which sometimes have equal off - diagonal couplings and sometimes different ones , by alternating between the strategies described here and in the last subsection .",
    "we now briefly describe how the linear case is generalised to arbitrary graphs .",
    "this is almost identical to @xcite , so we will not repeat the details . similar to the spin case , in the general graph setting , measurements on a single spin do not suffice : we need to consider transport in the network . depending on the network topology",
    ", we choose a set @xmath132 of ` infecting ' @xcite nodes , which are the ones we will perform initialisations and measurements on . for clarity ,",
    "let us recall the definition of graph ` infection ' .",
    "suppose that a subset @xmath132 of nodes of the graph is ` infected ' with some property , e.g. , the flu .",
    "this property then spreads , infecting other nodes , by the following rule : an infected node infects a ` healthy ' ( uninfected ) neighbour if and only if it is its unique healthy neighbour . if eventually all nodes are infected , the initial set @xmath132 is called ` infecting ' .",
    "similar to the measurements described in subsection  [ sub : experimental - requirements ] , initialising the site @xmath133 and measuring the @xmath134 node after some time , we can obtain@xmath135 again , the dependence on the initial state @xmath62 may be removed by subtracting data for different initial conditions on the sites @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "starting from some element in @xmath138 say @xmath139 we can get @xmath140 as described in subsection  [ sub : experimental - requirements ] .",
    "then we initialise in @xmath136 and measure at a different site @xmath141 obtaining @xmath142 _ including its phase _ from eq .  ( [ eq:3rec ] ) .",
    "hence , all @xmath143 with @xmath144 can be learnt from simple experiments on the set @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath145 estimation and infection are then used to infer the remaining parameters , as described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "naturally , the above scheme can be applied directly to many cases of hamiltonian identification for systems of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "a typical example is the @xmath146 chain of spin-1/2 particles,@xmath147+\\sum_{n=1}^{n}b_{n}s_{n}^{z},\\ ] ] as it can be transformed into quasi - free fermions by means of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "as it has been noted already in @xcite , the estimation for this model can be done without initialisation of the entire chain . in the jordan - wigner picture",
    "this becomes very clear .",
    "that is , after locally measuring an eigenstate of @xmath148 thus making @xmath149 the initial expectation values of the @xmath150 and @xmath8 @xmath151 are all zero .",
    "this is because the jordan - wigner transformation of @xmath150 ( @xmath152 , i.e. , @xmath153 always contains @xmath154 in the product .",
    "one might say that the local initialisation in the spin picture corresponds to a global initialisation in the fermionic picture .",
    "combined with the weak dependence of local observables on the initial condition that comes from the quasi - free interaction , the state dependence of the measurements at the first site is completely removed .",
    "hence our scheme is a proper generalisation of @xcite to include magnetic field and the transverse ising case , which is important in various physical systems , e.g. , superconducting ( flux ) qubits @xcite , nmr , etc .",
    "such models have also attracted attention in the context of indirect quantum control recently  @xcite , where our estimation scheme is crucial .",
    "we found a simple and efficient method to identify the hamiltonian of a system of coupled bosons or fermions .",
    "while the methods are completely analogous to the spin case @xcite , it is surprising that the higher number of parameters in the hamiltonian that arises from the non - conservation of excitations can still be estimated using the same resources . similarly to @xcite , we can deal with very weak system initialisation , such as thermal states .",
    "therefore our methods can drastically reduce the required resources for system identification .",
    "since we allow for site - dependent anisotropies , not only the coupling strengths but also the type of interaction is determined along the way . from the theory side ,",
    "our work once more confirmed a type of ` area law ' for estimation : looking only at the surface of short - range interacting systems can completely determine their hamiltonian .",
    "it would be intriguing to see if this has direct connections with area laws of entanglement @xcite . while the efficiency of our method relied on the quadratic form of the hamiltonian",
    ", we conjecture that even for models with true interaction terms , e.g. , quartic terms in the hamiltonian , all system parameters remain discoverable on the surface in principle .",
