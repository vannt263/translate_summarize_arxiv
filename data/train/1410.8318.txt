    "+ a new measurement , using data taken in 2010 , offers a significantly improved precision for both the direct photon spectra and the azimuthal anisotrop  @xcite .",
    "this new measurement uses the conversion of real photons in the detector material for the measurement , it confirms the previously published data and extends the transverse momentum range towards lower @xmath5 .",
    "the new data furthermore allow the analysis in finer centrality bins than before .",
    "the thermal photon yield is extracted as the excess of the direct photon production over the binary - scaled @xmath3 baseline .",

    "the exponent @xmath10 was found to be common for all @xmath5 integration ranges , with @xmath11 .",
    "this is in the range of recent theoretical models describing direct photon emission in au+au collisions at this energy  ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "+ the new methods have also been used to measure the direct photon azimuthal anisotropy , for the first time , the triangular flow @xmath2 has also been measured . the @xmath0 range and the precision of @xmath1",

    "heavy quarks are produced predominantly in hard scattering processes in the early phase of the collisions and hence can be used as a probe for the evolution of the medium .",
    "quarkonia can be used like a thermometer for the medium , for example the @xmath12 dissolves at a lower temperature than the @xmath15 .",
    "phenix has excellent capabilities to measure heavy flavor production and quarkonia through leptonic channels .",
    "+ one result of the @xmath15 measurement in cu+au collisions at @xmath14 = 200 gev is the ratio of the yields in the cu - going direction and the au - going direction  @xcite . this ratio is shown in figure  [ fig : quarkonia]a as a function of centrality , represented by the number of participants . the suppression of the @xmath15 is stronger in the cu - going direction which is consistent with more low - x shadowing in the au nucleus than the cu nucleus .",
    "the result is also consistent with observations in @xmath16+au collisions at the same energy where the suppression is stronger in the @xmath16 going direction .",
    "+ the @xmath12 has been measured in au+au collisions at the same energy  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 is shown in figure  [ fig : quarkonia]b , a suppression of the @xmath12 is seen in more central collisions . the suppression is consistent with the disappearance of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 states of the meson .",

    "@xcite surprisingly , @xmath13 of these single electrons shows an enhancement over the @xmath3 reference at this energy , as seen in figure  [ fig : heavy_flavor]a .",
    "this is opposite to the measurement of the same observable at @xmath14 = 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath1 measurement , shown in figure  [ fig : heavy_flavor]b , hints at a small but positive @xmath1 for heavy - flavor electrons which is also predicted by theoretical models . with the currently large uncertainties , no final conclusion can be drawn ,",

    "lhc analyses on @xmath19+pb collisions at @xmath14 = 5.02 tev have indicated strong azimuthal long - range correlations of hadron pairs , phenix has complemented these results with a measurement of the charged particle @xmath1 in @xmath16+au collisions at @xmath14 = 200 gev , using a small rapidity gap of @xmath20 = 0.47 to 0.7  @xcite .",
    "so far , the reason for these anisotropies is now known . + a new analysis of the azimuthal angular correlations between charged hadrons at central rapidity and the energy deposited in a calorimeter at forward ( au - going direction ) rapidity , with a pseudorapidity gap of @xmath21 , shows an enhanced near - side angular correlation  @xcite .",

    "the mass splitting at lower @xmath0 is seen in the calculation as well , the mass splitting is larger at the lhc which might indicate a larger radial flow in the higher energy regime .",
