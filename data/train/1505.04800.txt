    "the goal of this paper is to establish some loewy structure results for specht modules which lie in the principal block of @xmath2 . for the remainder of the paper , the principal block of @xmath2",
    "will be denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "weight @xmath6 specht modules are well understood .",
    "when @xmath7 the specht modules are simple and projective , and each @xmath1-block contains exactly one specht module . for @xmath8",
    "the ext@xmath9-quiver is a line segment , and the specht modules have loewy length and composition length at most 2 . over odd characteristic , if @xmath10 then a specht module has loewy length at most 3 and composition length at most 5 ( cf .",
    "proposition 6.2 of @xcite and theorem 5.6 of @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we prove four structure results for specht modules which lie in the principal block of @xmath2 .",
    "the first result shows that specht modules in the block have loewy lengths bounded above by 4 .",
    "the second result is a necessary and sufficient condition on a partition @xmath11 so that the corresponding specht module ( in the principal block ) attains the maximum possible loewy length in corollary [ cor : nscondition ] .",
    "the third result shows that if @xmath12 is a reducible specht module in the principal block with @xmath11 @xmath1-regular then its second radical layer is determined by the ext@xmath9-quiver of the block .",
    "for such a partition @xmath11 we also prove that if @xmath12 has loewy length 3 then @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the fourth result gives an ( attained ) upper bound of 14 on the composition length for specht modules in the block .",
    "the approach taken to prove the mentioned results relates partitions in the principal block of @xmath2 to partitions in weight 2 blocks of @xmath14 then inducing back up to the principal block .",
    "this approach is motivated by the work of martin and russell in @xcite , where the authors show that a substantial portion of the @xmath15-quiver for the principal block of @xmath2 is built from @xmath15-quivers of the defect 2 blocks of @xmath14 .    for the case",

    "the author gives the loewy structures of the projective indecomposable modules of @xmath18 ( cf .",
    "theorems 2.15 , 2.17 of @xcite ) .",
    "since every projective indecomposable module of the symmetric group is a young module one is able to deduce the following : if @xmath11 is a partition in @xmath18 that is both @xmath19-regular and @xmath19-restricted then @xmath12 has loewy length 4 . now",
    "if @xmath11 is a partition in @xmath18 that is @xmath19-regular and not @xmath19-restricted then one may apply lemma 2.14 of @xcite and the arguments of lemmas [ lem : sinduce ] , [ lem : nicerest ] , [ lem : getit ] , and theorem [ thm : gotit ] of this paper to conclude @xmath12 has loewy length at most 3 .",
    "so the specht modules in @xmath18 have loewy length at most 4 , and a specht module having loewy length 4 necessarily corresponds to a partition that is both 3-regular and 3-restricted .",
    "the representations in the blocks @xmath18 and @xmath5 appear to behave similarly even though @xmath18 has non - abelian defect group and @xmath5 has abelian defect group .",
    "in fact , after analyzing the ext@xmath9-quiver of @xmath18 , we see proposition [ prop : mullextend ] and corollary [ cor : ks ] of this paper are also true for @xmath18 .",
    "in section [ section : prelim ] we recall some background material in the representation theory of the symmetric group . in section [ section : partitions ]",
    "we prove a few results for certain weight 3 partitions of @xmath20 . in section [ section : irreducibles ]",
    "we classify all specht modules lying in certain defect 2 blocks of @xmath21 that are irreducible .",
    "we then determine the specht modules in @xmath22 that have an irreducible restriction to a defect 2 block of @xmath14 .",
    "section [ section : loewy ] contains the two main results of the paper , corollaries [ cor : nscondition ] and [ cor : ks ] .",
