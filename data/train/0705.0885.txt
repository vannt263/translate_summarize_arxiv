    "because of their compactness , their high brightness and the fact that they occur in a wide variety of astrophysical environments , masers are excellent astrophysical probes .",

    "consequently , they allow for a determination of the dynamical importance of the magnetic field . and , since masers are specifically suited for high angular resolution observations with interferometry instruments , the polarization observations can probe the magnetic field properties at unprecedented small scales .    in the period since the previous iau maser conference ( migenes & reid 2002 ) ,",
    "the number of maser polarization observations have increased significantly .",
    "they have been used to determine the strength and structure of magnetic field in the circumstellar envelopes ( cse ) of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , high - mass star forming regions and supernova remnants ( snrs ) , while observations of the magnetic field strength in megamasers have also become possible .",
    "this review details specifically the results on magnetic field measurements derived from maser polarization observations since 2001 , focusing on the maser transitions in the radio - wavelength regime . in  [ sect1 ] , the theoretical background of maser polarization and analysis considerations are discussed briefly .",
    "recent magnetic field measurements and their consequences for related astrophysical problems involving evolved stars and high - mass star forming regions are presented in  [ sect2 ] and  [ sect3 ] respectively .  [ sect4 ] details observations of snr and megamaser magnetic fields and finally  [ sect5 ] presents perspectives for future instruments and observations .",
    "there exists extensive literature on the theory of maser polarization , as polarization during maser amplification differs from the regular thermal emission case due to the stimulated emission process and a range of other properties of the masing process that can influence the radiation polarization characteristics .",
    "the main theoretical problem is framed by constructing the density matrix evolution and radiative transfer equations for the maser emission including the zeeman terms ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* goldreich et al . 1973 ) ) .",
    "the zeeman effect occurs when the degeneracy of magnetic substates is broken under the influence of a magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the zeeman effect is significantly different for paramagnetic ( e.g. oh ) and non - paramagnetic molecules ( e.g. sio , h@xmath0o and methanol ) , due to the ratio between the bohr magneton ( @xmath1 ) and the nuclear magneton ( @xmath2 ) . in these expressions",
    "@xmath3 is the electron charge , @xmath4 is the planck constant and @xmath5 the speed of light . the ratio of the two ( @xmath6 )",
    "is determined by the ratio of the electron mass ( @xmath7 ) and the nucleon mass ( @xmath8 ) and implies three orders of magnitudes larger zeeman splitting for a similar magnetic field strength in the case of paramagnetic molecules compared to the non - paramagnetic ones .",
    "a fundamental difference in the treatment of polarized maser emission exists between cases when the magnetic transitions overlap in frequency or when they are well separated .",
    "this can be defined by the splitting ratio @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the zeeman splitting and @xmath11 the doppler line width .",
    "typically , @xmath12 for the paramagnetic molecule oh , while @xmath13 for the other , non - paramagnetic maser species . in the case of @xmath14 there are no theoretical ambiguities and the zeeman components are well separated and resolved .",

    "the transition @xmath18 gives rise to the @xmath19 component , linearly polarized along @xmath17 .",
    "for an arbitrary angle between @xmath17 and the maser propagation direction @xmath20 , the resultant components are elliptically polarized for @xmath21 , and linearly polarized for @xmath22 .",

    "a comparison of the different polarization theories is given by @xcite , who finds the numerical models can be used to accurately describe the maser polarization .",
    "this is further supported by h@xmath0o maser polarization observations that are best described by the numerical models by @xcite . when @xmath13 the relation between the linear polarization angle and the magnetic field direction is complex .",
    "the magnetic field direction is either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field , depending on @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath24 , the polarization vectors are parallel to the magnetic field and when @xmath25 they are perpendicular . however , this relation is only valid when the zeeman frequency shift under the influence of the magnetic field @xmath26 is much larger than the rate of stimulated emission @xmath27 .",
    "otherwise , the relation between polarization angle and magnetic field direction is dependent on the maser intensity .",
    "however , this is unlikely to affect any except the strongest of maser features .",
    "the predicted relation between @xmath20 and the polarization angle from h@xmath0o maser theory is supported by the observations of a @xmath28 polarization angle flip when @xmath20 crosses the critical angle in combination with the predicted decrease in linear polarization fraction ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the derived @xmath17 strengths when @xmath13 do not only depend on the circular polarization fraction but also depend on the maser saturation level . especially for masers that are saturated , simple assumptions with a fixed proportionality between circular polarization and magnetic field strength can lead to @xmath17 being overestimated by up to a factor of 4 .",
    "on the other hand , velocity gradients along the maser path can cause the true field strength to be underestimated by a factor of two ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vlemmings 2006 ) ) .",

    "maser polarization observations are the predominant source of information about the role of magnetic fields during the late stages of stellar evolution .",
