    "+ the special theory of relativity is based on the supposition of the physics law invariance of the _ moving _ straightly in space with constant velocity ( inertial ) frames of references . some invariant `` formulae '' exist in these different frames , so we can use some references to correlate different frames to each other . the same invariance principle is used for local space regions in einstein s general relativity theory .",
    "+ on this way it seems to be logic to make the following step and suppose the physics law invariance in the _ rotating _ frames of references . only the space rotation with the constant rotation frequency will be considered in this paper .",
    "the question is what can we use as a reference between frames ?",
    "may be , the physical object in one frame of references can be interpreted as another physical object in other frame , and some known physical laws will be valid in both frames , but it will be _ different _ physical laws for _ different _ physical objects .",

    "the axis space rotation by fixed angle is a particular case of the considered asr , so the transformation matrix for any asr can be represented as a product of two fixed angle asr transformation matrices and one asr transformation matrix and all asrs are about the coordinate axes :    @xmath24    we will call this expression as an _ asr coordinate expansion_. + considering a set of all asrs about all space axes at some fixed space point , one will conclude that the space rotation invariance ( if it exists ) has a local character .",

    "+ if the potential function @xmath91 with @xmath92 , so the constant @xmath87 has a meaning of a kinetic energy of the `` free '' physical object in a fundamental frame of references of the force field .",
    "so , for the attractive ( for the object ) field , @xmath93 corresponds to the case of the capture of the object by the field and some stable states of the system may exist , @xmath94 corresponds to a free motion of the object .",
    "+ also , in distinguish with the schrdinger equation , the equation ( [ schrod ] ) and , with some stipulations , ( [ schrodinger ] ) have to be true also in the relativistic case .",
    "+ combining the second partial derivatives by space and time coordinates for the function @xmath57 ( [ pso ] ) , it is also possible to cancel imaginary parts and to get another equation :    @xmath95    there are included functions only from space coordinates in @xmath2 on the right part of the equation ( @xmath96/q^{in}=\\nabla^2 q / q$ ] ) , but on the left part - in frame @xmath2 .",
    "thus , with the stability condition of the considered physical object , it needs to be a scalar on the right part of ( [ klein ] ) in brackets . designating this scalar as @xmath97",

    "it becomes clear that the @xmath0 - invariance is the reason of the _ uncertainties _ in quantum mechanics , the reason of its incompleteness and formalism @xcite .",
    "m. gell - mann @xcite characterized the quantum physics as a discipline `` @xmath98 full of mysteries and paradoxes , that we do not completely understand , but are able to use .",

    "+ for the further analysis it is important to mention that the conclusions in this section are valid not only for the axis space rotation , but also for any rotation , where the @xmath0-invariance principle may be introduced .",
    "for example , it needs to be valid for any msr , if all asrs , included in this msr , have equal or multiple frequencies and are normalized .",
    "the requirement of the normalization is coming from ( [ n7 ] ) . in case of the ssr ,",
    "this requirement is unable to satisfy due to ssr transformation matrix properties ( sect .",

    "also , if the function @xmath144 is periodical with period @xmath153 : @xmath154 , @xmath83 is integer , one can get the zero influence in `` external '' regions @xmath155 and @xmath149 .",
    "there are two decisions : the `` symmetrical '' , when @xmath156 and `` anti - symmetrical '' one with @xmath157 .",

    "+ in three - dimensional space , it is possible to set the problem as follows . if the stable sr object exists in some limited space region @xmath161 and",
    "this object is the source of the wave - like field @xmath162 , so it needs to satisfy the wave equation :    @xmath163    where @xmath145 is a speed of the influence wave , @xmath164 is some source function .",
    "we consider the sr object as a source of the influence field @xmath162 , so , following sect .",
    "[ sec : quantum ] ( [ ps ] ) in frames of @xmath0-invariance we can put for source function :    @xmath165    usually , in transmission from quantum mechanics to electrodynamics , the source function is defined as @xmath166 .",
    "it is not satisfactory for us , because this way the internal , source characteristics are neglected , but there are these properties we want to investigate .",
    "+ after that , seaching the solution in form @xmath167 , we wil come directly to a well known differential equation for function @xmath168 @xcite :    @xmath169    here @xmath170 . to find the solution",
    ", one needs to know the concrete function q(x ) .",
    "it is not necessary for our analysis . we need to require for a stable object that somewhere in space around the object , this influence or , in other words",
    ", the energy flow from the object is zero .",
    "we will replace the equation ( [ de ] ) and consider also well known equation for the external sphere potential @xcite .",
    "in spherical coordinates :    @xmath171    where @xmath172 are spherical functions and @xmath173 is defined on some sphere @xmath174 of radius @xmath175 .",
    "the solution of this equation will be :    @xmath176    where @xmath177 are some constants , @xmath178 are bessel s functions of the first and the second kind correspondingly . as far as , the function @xmath168 needs to be zero at @xmath174 , so @xmath179 , from ( [ sph ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) , we will get the necessary condition for the stable sr object existence in @xmath2 :    @xmath180    so , the sr objects in @xmath2 are allowed to have discrete `` sizes '' @xmath181 , where @xmath182 are the zeros of the bessel functions .",
    "we will call these necessary conditions as a _ quantification principle_. the quantification takes place without any `` external '' force field .",
