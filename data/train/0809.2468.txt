    "the symmetric exclusion process ( sep ) is one of the simplest and well studied models of a stochastic interacting particle system . in this model which can be defined on a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice ,",
    "particles move diffusively while satisfying the hard core constraint that two particles can not be on the same site .",
    "a number of exact results have been obtained for this model , particularly in one dimension @xcite .",
    "if the model is defined on a ring and conserves the total density , the system obeys the equilibrium condition of detailed balance in the steady state and thus does not support any net current .",
    "a lot of attention has also been given to non - equilibrium steady states of driven sep in which the particles can enter or leave the bulk at the boundaries .",
    "for this model , the time - dependent correlation functions @xcite and dynamical exponents have been obtained using the equivalence of the transition matrix ( @xmath2-matrix ) to the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "recently , large deviation functional and current fluctuations have also been calculated for the driven sep @xcite .",
    "experimentally it has been shown that sep can be used to model the diffusion of colloidal particles in narrow pores @xcite .    motivated by studies on quantum pumps where oscillating voltages can drive electron current across a wire @xcite",
    ", we have recently shown that similar effect can occur in a sep model in which the hopping rates at two neighbouring sites are chosen to vary periodically in time and with a relative phase difference @xcite .",
    "our results obtained using monte - carlo simulations and a second - order perturbative calculation in the amplitude @xmath3 of the time - dependent part of the hopping rate can be summarized as follows : ( i ) a @xmath0 current @xmath4 is obtained , which decays with system size @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "correspondingly the time averaged density profile varies linearly in the bulk of the system .",
    "( ii ) the _ dc _ current @xmath4 depends sinusoidally on the phase difference between rates at two sites .",
    "( iii ) the dependence of @xmath4 on driving frequency @xmath7 shows a peak at a frequency @xmath8 with @xmath9 as @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "the latter result means that a finite number of particles are circulated even in the adiabatic limit .",
    "classical pumping of particles and heat , in similar time - dependent stochastic models , has also been studied in @xcite and seen in experiments @xcite .",
    "systems exhibiting pumping effect have often been modeled as brownian ratchets in which non - interacting particles move in an external periodic potential .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , these pump models are similar to brownian ratchets @xcite where non - interacting particles placed in spatially asymmetric potentials that vary periodically in time and acted upon by noise execute directed motion .",
    "models of non - interacting particles moving in symmetric potentials have also been considered @xcite and pumping demonstrated .",
    "however for the model studied by us , particle interactions seem necessary for the pumping effect .",
    "our model differs from such models in that here we are dealing with a many body particle system with interactions .",
    "for such an extended system , as described in the following section , the @xmath13-point equation does not close and involves next order correlation functions also .",
    "pumping effect has also been found in the steady state of a driven sep with two species ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) of particles in which both species have the same diffusion constant @xcite . in this case , although the total current @xmath16 due to both species obeys the fick s law , the current due to one of the species does not follow the density gradient",
    ". however the pumping mechanism is different from that in our model where it arises due to the time - dependent rates .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a generalization of our earlier model by allowing the rates at all the sites to be time - dependent with a relative phase difference between neighbouring sites .",
    "the model is treated analytically using two approximations : a perturbation theory in the time - dependent part of the driving , and an expansion in the large frequency limit to leading orders .",
    "the treatment in this paper considerably simplifies the earlier one given in @xcite .",
    "the most interesting new result is that in the model with time - dependent rates at all sites , a current of order unity can be obtained even in the thermodynamic limit for certain choices of relative phase differences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ moddef ] ) ,",
    "the model is defined . in section  ( [ purturb ] ) the details of the first perturbation theory ( expansion in @xmath3 )",
    "are given , and two special choices of hopping rates are discussed .",
    "the results obtained from a sudden approximation ( expansion in @xmath17 ) are given in section  ( [ sudden ] ) .",
    "finally we end with a discussion in section  ( [ discuss ] ) .",
    "the model is defined on a ring with @xmath5 sites .",
    "a site @xmath18 can be occupied by @xmath19 or @xmath20 particle and the system contains a total of @xmath21 particles where @xmath22 is the total density .",
    "a particle at site @xmath23 hops to an empty site either on the left or right with equal rates given by : u_l & = & f_0 + f_1 v_l + where   v_l & = & _ l ( t + _ l ) = _ l e^i t+ _ l^ * e^-i t  . here",
    "the site - dependent complex amplitudes are defined by @xmath24 with @xmath25 real and @xmath3 is chosen such that all hopping rates are positive .",
    "we will discuss two particular choices for the hopping rates in detail .",
    "our first choice corresponds to the case where the hopping rates are time - dependent at only two sites of the ring , and we get an average current which decays inversely with system size . in the second case ,",
    "we choose time - dependent hopping rates at all sites and show that a finite current can be obtained even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a configuration of the system can be specified by the set @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "let us define @xmath28 as the probability vector in the configuration space , with elements @xmath29 giving the probability of the system being in the configuration @xmath30 at time @xmath31 .",
    "then the stochastic dynamics of the many particle system is described by the master equation : = * w*(t )  * p*(t)= * w_0 *   * p*(t)+ * w_1*(t )  * p*(t ) [ master ] where @xmath32 is the transition matrix , which we have split into a time - independent and a time - dependent part .",

    "note that for @xmath44 , the above model reduces to the homogeneous sep with periodic boundary conditions whose properties are known exactly . in this case",
    "the steady state is an equilibrium state which obeys detailed balance and hence the average current is zero ( note that this result holds even when the rates @xmath45 are site - dependent , but time - independent ) . in the steady state ,",

    "for @xmath48 , the knowledge of the exact steady state of homogeneous sep enables us to set up a perturbation expansion in @xmath3 of various observables .",

    "this of course corresponds to a wave traveling in a _ given _ direction .",
    "a non - trivial aspect of the problem studied is the fact that the effect goes away as soon as we switch off the hard - core interactions . for non - interacting particles ,",
    "the @xmath0 current given by @xmath153 , is immediately seen to be exactly zero for arbitrary choice of the time - dependent rates . on the other hand ,",
    "having interactions in the system is not a sufficient condition to generate a @xmath0 current . for the models considered in this paper ,",
    "the hopping rate is site - wise symmetric .",
    "but if the hopping rates are symmetric bond - wise , _",
    "i.e. _ , the hop rate @xmath154 from site @xmath23 to @xmath40 is the same as that from @xmath40 to @xmath23 , then the @xmath0 current is zero for any choice of phases @xmath150 . to see this ,",
    "consider the density evolution equation obeyed by bond - wise symmetric sep : = u_l-1,l ( _ l-1-_l)+u_l , l+1 ( _ l+1-_l ) unlike eq .",
    "( [ denseq ] ) for site - wise symmetric sep , @xmath155 is a solution of the above equation for any choice of rates @xmath156 . in fact",
    ", an inspection of the master equation shows that , even with a time - dependent @xmath32-matrix , all configurations are equally likely , thus leading to zero current . thus the exclusion process with bond - wise symmetric rates",
    "does not give the ratchet effect .",
    "it is not completely clear as to what are the necessary and sufficient conditions to get a directed current @xcite .    for the model considered here , since the equations for any @xmath13-point correlation function do not close , it does not seem simple to solve the model exactly .",
    "we have therefore studied the system analytically using a perturbation theory in the amplitude @xmath3 and the inverse frequency @xmath136 . in this paper , we have been able to obtain the @xmath0 current at order @xmath157 by solving the evolution equations for density and two point correlation function to order @xmath3 .",
    "this is unlike our earlier solution in @xcite where the density was obtained to second order in @xmath3 .",
    "also , we have been able to obtain results for large driving frequency by solving the correlation function alone by such perturbative approaches .",
    "comparing with simulations we find that the perturbative results turn out to be quite accurate .",
    "we now briefly comment on the adiabatic limit , which has been much studied in the quantum context . in our case , from our perturbation theory result we see that , over one time period of the driving there is a finite particle transport , even in the adiabatic limit .",
    "formally we can obtain an exact expression for the net particle transport .",
    "for this we start with the master equation @xmath158 .",
    "let @xmath159 be the instantaneous equilibrium solution satisfying @xmath160 . then , for slow rates @xmath7 , @xmath28 will have the form @xmath161 where the correction is given by : @xmath162  .",
    "the net particle transported across any bond in one time cycle , @xmath163 , can then be expressed as : = _ 0^t dt _ c j(c ) p(c , t ) = -_0 ^ 2 dx _ c , c j(c ) p^(0)(c,x )  , where @xmath164 refers to the current on any given bond .",
    "thus we have a formal expression , for the net particle transported , in terms of an integral over an _ equilibrium average _ of some quantity .",
    "however this expression does not appear to have any simple physical interpretation and it is not easy to obtain any explicit results , unlike the fast case treated in section  ( [ sudden ] ) .",
    "recently adiabatic pumping phenomena have been studied in the context of geometric phase interpretation @xcite , but the main focus has been on two - state stochastic systems . in this case , the current from system to the reservoirs was calculated using full counting statistic in the adiabatic or slow driving regime .    finally , we point out that an experimental realization of the effect observed in our model should be possible in colloidal systems . for instance , consider a colloidal suspension in an externally applied laser field . this constitutes a system of diffusive interacting particles in an external potential ( generated by the laser field ) of the form @xmath165 .",
    "this system is similar to the model that we have studied .",
    "there are some differences , namely , in this case because the external field is space dependent , hence the effective hopping rates are not symmetric in the forward and backward directions",
    ". it would be interesting to study this model to see if a current can be generated here , and perhaps one can make detailed predictions for experimental observation ."
