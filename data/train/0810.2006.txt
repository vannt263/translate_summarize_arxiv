    "recent cosmological observations point towards an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch . in the cosmological scale",
    "it is expected or otherwise speculated that the cosmological constant is responsible , through a repulsive force , for such an expansion .",
    "one might wonder why the same repulsive force should not be at work in the solar system scale .",
    "in particular , why @xmath0 should not produce such a repulsive force around a local source of a spherical spacetime such as sun leading , in principle , to very small deviations from the well known predictions of gr based on schwarzschild spacetime calculations .",
    "the basis of this expectation is the fact that , as for the usual einstein field equations , the modified equations ( those in the presence of the cosmological constant ) should also be employed in both solar as well as cosmological scales .",
    "it seems that it was in response to such a question that rindler and ishak have recently @xcite revisited the question of light bending in schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) spacetime and find out that despite previous claims @xcite @xcite @xmath0 affects light bending .",
    "since then there has been a lot of discussion /controversy specially over employing the same results in a consistent manner to the cosmological lensing problem in the context of freedman - lemaitre models @xcite - @xcite .",
    "specially it was shown by gibbons et al .",
    "why the absence of @xmath0 in the equation of null geodesics in sds spacetime does not imlpy that light bending is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "they find the origin of this absence in the fact that in finding the null geodesic equation one projects them onto a hypersurface of constant time . in this way the projective properties of the null rays are independent of the cosmological constant but other geometrical or conformal properties of the rays such as their lengths and angles",
    "should be identified through the full metric where @xmath0 appears @xcite .",
    "it is an obvious fact that if the effect of a parameter in the newtonian limit of a metric is present in a phenomenon ( such as light bending ) then the same effect should also be present in the full general relativistic treatment of the same phenomenon .",
    "it is also well known that , using intuitive arguments based on the relativistic equivalence of mass and energy in the one hand and newtonian gravity on the other hand , one could obtain basic features of inherently general relativistic effects such as gravitational redshift and light bending @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will employ the same strategy to find the effects of @xmath0 on mercury s perihelion precession and light bending in the context of the newtonian limit of sds spacetime .",
    "schwarzschild- de sitter ( sds ) spacetime in its static form ( or in the static patch ) is given by the following line element @xmath1 it is an spherically symmetric spacetime with two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath0 corresponding to mass and the cosmological constant respectively .",
    "it reduces to schwarzschild ( de sitter ) spacetime for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and obviously is interpreted as the de sitter spacetime in which a spherically symmetric point mass is embedded .",
    "since it is spherically symmetric one could read out the newtonian potential from the @xmath5 component of the metric as ( bringing in the fundamental constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) ; @xmath8 since sds is not asymptotically flat this is valid as long as @xmath9 .",
    "to the light bending . indeed this fact will link our result on light bending to that found in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the discussion after eq .",
    "( 27 ) . ] indeed ( [ potential ] ) is a solution to the modified poisson s equation @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "obviously the above modified potential leads to the modified force ( per unit mass ) ; @xmath11 in other words the extra `` harmonic oscillator type '' potential in ( [ potential ] ) leads to the repulsive force @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is quite amazing to know that newton in his discussion on gravitational force in principia , exploring other central force laws , had come to the conclusion that the other central force for which one could consider the whole mass of a spherically symmetric distribution at its center is a linear central force @xcite .",
    "it seems that pierre simon laplace was the first to consider the superposition of the two forces explicitly in the form @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "looking at the newtonian limit of sds , the extra linear term contemplated by newton , has been noticed as a classical analogue to the introduction of the cosmological constant term in general relativity .",
    "it should also be noted that the compromise between @xmath0 s cosmological role and its role in an exact solution for a compact object such as sun is not trivial .",
    "we will get back to this point later in the article .",
    "our starting point to study classical tests of general relativity in the context of the newtonian limit of sds spacetime is the above modified force .",
    "since @xmath0 appears explicitly in the equation of timelike geodesics in sds spacetime , unlike light bending there has been no ambiguity over its effect on mercury s perihelion precession . indeed using timelike geodesics in sds one can easily show that @xmath0 has a definite effect on mercury s perihelion precession in the form of an additional advancement by an amount @xcite @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the sun s mass ( i.e the mass parameter in schwarzschild metric ) and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the orbit s semi - major axis and eccentricity respectively . and",
    "the result is found to have a different dependence on the eccentricity of the form @xmath19 .",
    "this does not make any difference in our case since we are going to consider only approximately circular orbits i.e @xmath20 .",
    "] here we aim to show how one can obtain the same result , up to a constant factor , by employing the above modified newtonian gravity combined with special relativistic mass - energy equivalence , namely @xmath21 , applied to both the planet and the sun s _ modified _ gravitational field .",
    "first of all we note that from special relativity for a moving mass such as a planet we have @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the planet s rest mass .",
    "secondly the gravity field around sun has energy and correspondingly a mass which for the usual gravitational potential in ( [ potential ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath24 calculating the same kind of mass for the linear part of the gravitational potential ( [ potential ] ) corresponding to the cosmological constant @xmath0 , we note that from poisson s equation @xmath25 one can assign a uniform energy density @xmath26 and consequently , through mass - energy equivalence , a mass @xmath27 which will affect a planet in a circular orbit of radius @xmath28 around the sun . applying the above relations to the total energy of a planet at radius @xmath28 around sun we end up with @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is the sun s modified mass at a distance @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath0 appears twice in eq .",
    "once through its contribution in the modified mass and then through its own potential energy arising from the @xmath0-dependent gravitational potential in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . substituting for @xmath31 and @xmath32 in ( [ 6 ] ) and expanding @xmath31 in terms of @xmath33 and using the fact that for an approximately circular orbit @xmath34 , we find up to the second order in @xmath33 , @xmath35 in which the first two terms in the right hand side are the familiar newtonian contribution to the planet s energy .",
    "the third term is due to the mass attributed to the gravitational energy @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) and through this crude reasoning , responsible for the precession of mercury s perihelion @xcite giving both the order of magnitude and the correct sign of the effect as compared to the general relativistic value . instead of @xmath37 .",
    "this difference arises from the wrong expression used for the kinetic energy of the planet in @xcite , resulting in the wrong second order term ( @xmath38 ) in the expansion of the kinetic energy . ]",
    "the last two terms correspond to @xmath0 s contribution . ignoring the last term in comparison to the fourth term ( since their ratio @xmath39 ) it is noted that the extra advancement of planet s perihelion due to the cosmological constant is given by the ratio @xmath40 in which @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the @xmath0-dependent and newtonian gravitational potential energies ( i.e the fourth and the second terms in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 12 ) ) respectively , so that ; @xmath43 or @xmath44 comparing this result with ( [ peri1 ] ) for an approximately circular orbit ( i.e @xmath20 ) it is surprising that we have found the exact general relativistic result through the above approximate approach .",
    "it has already pointed out in the literature that the above result could only put an upper limit on the value of @xmath0 of order @xmath45 , since for values larger than this the effect of the cosmological constant on mercury s perhelion would be observable @xcite .",
    "but we know from the cosmological observations that this upper limit has already been well respected and the value of the cosmological constant is @xmath46 orders of magnitude smaller . in other words",
    "the precession induced by @xmath0 is at least @xmath47 times smaller than that due to the gravitational energy given by the ratio @xmath48 , in which @xmath49 is the third term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "the general classical equation of trajectory for a particle of mass @xmath31 and angular momentum @xmath50 under the action of a central force @xmath51 is given by @xcite ; @xmath52 in which @xmath53 . to study bending of light in a gravitational force field of the form ( [ force ] )",
    ", we follow laplace and assign a mass @xmath54 to photon so that the above equation takes the following form @xmath55 in which @xmath56 and @xmath57 . ) on the mass @xmath54 . ] to solve the above equation we use a perturbation method based on the fact that the last term in the above equation is much smaller than the other terms due to the smallness of @xmath58 . therefore , to the first order in @xmath58 , we assume a solution of the form @xmath59 in which @xmath60 is the zeroth order solution corresponding to the orbit of a particle under the influence of the usual inverse square law with eccentricity @xmath61 . now substituting ( [ 3 ] ) in ( [ 2 ] ) , we find the following equation for @xmath62 @xmath63 whose special solution , for @xmath64 ( i.e @xmath65 ) is given by ; @xmath66 and consequently the general solution for @xmath67 is as follows ; @xmath68 now the bending angle is given by , @xmath69 in which @xmath70 is the particle s ( here photon s ) azimuthal angle ( measured from the axis joining the deflector to the point of closeset approach ) at infinity .",
    "it is found by setting @xmath71 or equivalently @xmath72 in ( [ 4 ] ) ; @xmath73 to the lowest order in @xmath58 and in @xmath74 . again expanding the above function we have ; @xmath75 where we have chosen the plus sign in ( [ 7 ] ) to avoid the singularity in ( [ 4 ] ) at @xmath76 . substituting the above result in ( [ 5 ] ) we end up with",
    "; @xmath77 it is noted that the first term is the usual bending angle due to the inverse square law which is half the general relativistic value as expected .",
    "the second term which is induced through the linear force term in ( [ force ] ) bears the repulsive nature of @xmath0 in being negative and obviously reduces bending .",
    "this repulsive nature of @xmath0 could also be seen through the angular dependence of the extra ( @xmath0-dependent ) term ( [ 03 ] ) added to the light path in the absence of the cosmological constant .",
    "it is equal to zero at @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 ) and maximum at @xmath80 , so it is negative for @xmath81 and positive for @xmath82 .",
    "this leads , for the same angular positions , to larger ( smaller ) radii for the perturbed path compared to the unperturbed path for @xmath83 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "consequently the tangents to the unperturbed path will have steeper slopes compared to the perturbed path and thereby leading to a larger bending ( fig .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the perturbed path is dimpled around the closest approach due to this extra term .",
    "this corresponds , in the general relativistic treatment @xcite , to the spatial projection of the light path on the flamm praboloid near the schwarzschild region of sds ( where @xmath84 dominates over @xmath85 ) as comapred to the projection on a sphere with radius @xmath86 in its de sitter region ( where @xmath85 dominates over @xmath84 ) . to write the bending angle in terms of more common parameters we note",
    "that photon s angular momentum is given by @xmath87 in which @xmath88 is the distance of the closest approach .",
    "also taking @xmath89 as photons energy by neglecting its potential energy and substituting for @xmath50 in @xmath90 we find @xmath91 and consequently the contribution of @xmath0 to the bending angle is given by @xmath92 being dependent on the square root of @xmath0 , and the fact that from cosmological observatons @xmath93 , the above value is more pronounced compared to the general relativistic value obtained by rindler and ishak , @xmath94 depending on @xmath0 itself @xcite .",
    "this difference on the dependence of bending angle on the cosmological constant originates from the fact that , working in the newtonian realm , we have allowed @xmath95 in ( [ 4 ] ) which is obviously not allowed in full sds spacetime . in fact it was this non - asymptotic flatness of sds spacetime which led rindler and ishak to a local definition of bending angle for different angular positions ( @xmath96 ) of the observers .. ] to show the effect of this important fact more clearly , we find the bending angle for the finite value of @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath97 , which is geometrically equivalent to the intrinsically characterized @xmath28 value at @xmath98 in @xcite .",
    "we do this by computing the slopes of the tangents to the perturbed and unperturbed paths at @xmath97 .",
    "these are given by @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the unperturbed and perturbed paths respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore",
    "the contribution of the cosmological constant to the bending angle in this case is given by @xmath101 which compared to the general relativistic value eq .",
    "( 27 ) , not only has the right sign but also , up to a constant factor of @xmath102 , is the same @xmath0-dependent result .",
    "again as in the case of the mercury s perihelion , due to the very small value of the cosmological constant , it is expected that the effect of @xmath0 on light bending to be negligible .",
    "indeed for a light ray grazing sun s limb the light bending induced by the cosmological constant is @xmath103 !",
    "times smaller than that by the sun s mass itself @xcite .    ) and in the absence ( solid line ; @xmath104 ) of @xmath0 for @xmath105 .",
    "note that the difference between the paths is enormously exaggerated due to the small value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is also intersting to note that the perturbed path ( dashed line ) has the same shape ( in being dimpled around the closest approach ) as the spatially projected light path @xmath106 in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "the above results show clearly that one should have expected the effect of @xmath0 on light bending in a general relativistic treatment of the same phenomenon based on the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime as the metric around a spherical deflector such as sun . +",
    "as pointed out in the introduction one could think of the above calculation as the calculation of light bending in newton s modified gravity in which a linear force is added to the inverse square law .",
    "but then in the purely newtonian case one should be careful with the form of this extra term if one way or another it is going to be related to the newtonian limit of an appropriate general relativistic spacetime .",
    "for example in @xcite , as an straightforward conjecture , the full force ( per unit mass ) due to a point mass @xmath2 according to newton s modified gravity is given by @xmath107 in which @xmath108 is a constant . in other words",
    "the extra ( linear ) force is taken to be originated from the body s mass @xmath2 and proportional to it .",
    "it is obvious that now @xmath109 should be related to the cosmological constant if one is looking for a central repulsive force in a cosmology based on this modified newtonian gravity .",
    "to do so the authors have used the friedmann equation in the presence of @xmath0 in the weak field limit @xmath110 applied to a sphere of radius @xmath28 and mass @xmath2 leading to @xmath111 so that @xmath112 . in this way",
    "@xmath0 , in the cosmological scale , is related to the mass of the universe in the same spirit as in the einstein static universe in which @xmath2 and @xmath88 are the mass and radius of the universe respectively . ] and of course in line with mach s ideas on the origin of inertia .",
    "but it should be noted that this form for the linear force is not compatible with the newtonian limit of sds spacetime ( as an exact solution of einstein modified field equations for a compact spherical object of mass @xmath2 ) since , unlike the gravitational force in the newtonian limit of sds ( eq . ( 4 ) ) , here by setting the deflector mass @xmath2 equal to zero the total gravitational force vanishes .",
    "this originates in the simple fact that setting @xmath4 , sds spacetime reduces to that of de sitter and not minkowski i.e @xmath0 in sds spacetime is a new parameter independent of the mass of the central object .",
