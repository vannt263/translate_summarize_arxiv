    "let s start from the end - the end of our life , when our strength weakens and finally the death takes its toll .",
    "the mysterious nature of this phenomenon eludes scientific investigations , leaving it still the , , unsolved biological problem  @xcite .",
    "most of the ageing theories try to describe mechanisms which are suspected to shape the slow decay of life .",
    "they invoke various forms of damage to dna , cells , tissues and organs .",
    "the very popular free radical theory of aging may serve as an example @xcite .",
    "however , evolutionary theories try to reach the roots of the phenomenon , seeking to explain why we age ; in other words : how is it possible that senescence , which decreases the fitness of the individual , has evolved at all ? nevertheless , the proper use of these theories requires the awareness of their limitations , all these concepts should be , , handled with care  , as it was suggested by le bourg @xcite .",
    "one of the first biologists who proposed that ageing is a product of evolutionary forces was weismann @xcite .",
    "he believed that there is a genetically programmed death which eliminates older members of population , providing more resources for the younger generation . in this context",
    ", ageing represents an adaptation - advantageous for the species , even if it has a negative effect on the individual fitness .",
    "although weismann changed his views on the evolution of ageing over the course of his life , in the literature his name is associated with the first version of his programmed death theory . in response to this initial idea",
    ", medawar presented his own theory of ageing during an inaugural lecture at university college london in 1951 @xcite .",
    "he emphasised that the programmed death theory is logically circular ; why do animals age and die ? because they become worn out and decrepit and consequently valueless for the species .",
    "but why are they worn out and decrepit ? because they age . in other words , we are not ageless because we age .",
    "medawar took another approach ; the existence of a post - reproductive period is one of the consequences of senescence ; it is not its cause .",
    "developing his model of immortal species , medawar used as a metaphor random breaking and replacing of test tubes . in a chemical laboratory , equipped with a stock of the test tubes ,",
    "the broken tubes are replaced by the new ones ( age = 0 ) , after some time the number of test tubes of a given age will decline exponentially with age ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the older the test tubes are , the fewer there will be of them - not because they become more vulnerable with increasing age , but simply because the older test - tubes have been exposed the more times to the hazard of being broken @xcite .",
    "reproduction values of different age groups according to goldsmith @xcite .",
    "the youngest organisms , before the minimum reproduction age do not contribute to the reproduction .",

    "the youngest organisms , before the minimum reproduction age do not contribute to the reproduction .",
    "the contribution of the older groups is lower not because they are less fertile but because there are less of them in population.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    avoiding weismann s trap , medawar assumed the equal probability of reproduction for young and old individuals . since a non - ageing individual tends to have statistically the same number of progeny , every year , from puberty to death , the total number of produced progeny increased linearly with age .",
    "these two functions : exponential decrease of the number of individuals with age and linear increase of progeny with age shape the contribution of each age group to the total reproduction potential of population . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the reproductive value of the group of older individuals is low . in medawar s",
    "words : , , the older the age group , the smaller is its overall reproductive value ... this is not because ( the test tubes ) of the senior group are individually less fertile but merely because there are fewer of them ; and there are fewer of them not because they have become more fragile - their vulnerability is likewise unaltered - but simply because , being older , they have been exposed more often to the hazard of being broken  @xcite .",
    "summing up , medawar s idea states that the population loses individuals with time because of the random death , so the reproductive effect of the group of older individuals decreases with age , therefore the selection for their continued survival and reproduction should also weaken . since these verbal arguments have been formalized , the idea began life as a mathematically coherent theory@xcite .",
    "it turns out that before the onset of reproduction , the force of natural selection is highest and constant . after this time",
    ", however , the force of natural selection progressively falls , reaching zero around the cessation of reproduction . as a consequence",
    ", the genes beneficial early in life are favoured by natural selection while genes which should be expressed and necessary for surviving the late ages , after the reproduction period , can freely accumulate deleterious mutations .    according to mutation accumulation theory proposed by medawar himself",
    ", mutational pressure introduces new hereditary factors , which could lower the fertility or viability of the organisms .",
    "however , if they are expressed late enough , the force of selection will be too attenuated to oppose their establishment and spread @xcite .",
    "in this so called , , selection shadow  many germ - line mutations neutral for young individuals , but with late deleterious effects accumulate passively over generations leading to senescence and death @xcite . according to presented theory",
    ", ageing is a nonadaptive trait , being only a by - product of the way natural selection operates .",
    "it claims that senescence evolved because it is out of reach of natural selection and there was no possibility to eliminate it .",
    "that is why these theories are sometimes called the law of unintended consequences .",
    "however , the scientific opposition believe in , , death by design  and try to revive weisman s idea of ageing evolving as an adaptation .",
    "they criticise medawar s model of non - ageing species , which in their opinion is oversimplified and ignores the evolutionary importance of older animals .",
    "they claim that the probability of reproduction of old non - ageing individuals is not lower than that of young ones ( weisman s trap ) , nor is it equal ( medawar s idea ) ; in fact the old immortal individual has a higher probability of reproduction , since it is more mature and better fit .",
    "moreover , older non - ageing animals have lower probability of death than younger less experienced individuals : , , the old king is less likely to die in the war than the young foot soldier  @xcite . using this kind of arguments , , opposition ",
    "is trying to discredit medawar s assumptions and call reliability of his model into question .    finally , what is certain about the end of our biological existence ?",
    "the end is certain .        in this chapter",
    "we will present the results of computer simulations of populations evolution based on the penna model@xcite .",
    "hundreds of papers using this model or citing it have been already published .",
    "authors of these papers ( including penna himself ) claim that it is an ageing model and very often it is suggested that the model assumes the medawar hypothesis of ageing @xcite .",
    "in fact , the penna model does not assume the medawar hypothesis but the results of simulations using this model support the medawar hypothesis .",
    "moreover , the penna model could be very useful in describing many phenomena connected with the evolution of biological populations , like altruism @xcite , menopause @xcite , the role of the immunological system @xcite , of mother care @xcite , even the evolution of sex chromosomes @xcite .",
    "there are two main versions of the model , haploid and diploid .",
    "we will describe the diploid version only , because it fits much better to the biological reality . in the description of the model we will try to introduce some genetic terminology just to show the correspondence between some genetic elements and mechanisms and the virtual world of the model .",
    "it would facilitate further contacts of non - biologist readers with biologists .    in the model , populations are composed of individuals , each one represented by its genome composed of two haplotypes which are the bitstrings  @xmath0  bits long .",
    "bits represent genes .",
    "bits placed in the corresponding position ( locus / loci ) in the bitstrings are called alleles .",
    "if a bit is set to 0 , it represents a wild form of an allele ( a correct one ) , if a bit is set to 1 , it represents the defective allele .",
    "if one allele is defective and the other one in the corresponding locus of the second bitstring is wild , then two situations could be considered : if the defect is dominant - the function ( or phenotype ) is defective , if the defective allele is recessive - the function of the locus is normal , if both bits at the same positions are defective , the phenotype is always defective . in all",
    "presented here simulations we have assumed that all defective alleles are recessive .",
    "the main assumption of the penna model is the chronological switching on the pairs of alleles ; in the first monte carlo step ( mcs ) , the alleles at the first locus are switched on , in the second step , the alleles at the second locus and so on .",
    "one mcs corresponds to a time unit / period .",
    "the number of defective loci which kill the individual is one of the model parameter called the threshold @xmath1 .",
    "death of individual caused by the expression of the @xmath1 phenotypic defects is called the genetic death .",
    "if the individual expresses all pairs of alleles in its two bitstrings , then even if it does not reach the threshold @xmath1 it is going to die because of reaching the , , absolute maximum age  @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , when parameters are properly set , individuals do not reach that age , they are dying earlier because of the genetic death .",
    "when an individual reaches the minimum reproduction age @xmath2 ( after switching on @xmath2 pairs of alleles ) it can reproduce .",
    "in all our simulations we assume the conditions of sexual dimorphism and we declare that the sex of a newborn can be set as a male or a female with an equal probability .",
    "a  female at the reproduction age produces a gamete . to do that the diploid genome of that female is copied and during this process a new mutation is introduced into each haplotype ( a bitstring ) at the randomly chosen position with a probability @xmath3 per loci ( thus @xmath4 is the average number of mutations per haplotype ) .",
    "if the bit chosen for mutation has a value 0 - it is changed for 1 , if it is already 1 it stays 1 - there are no reversions .",
    "the two bitstrings recombine in the process mimicking the crossover with a probability @xmath5 .",
    "the position , where the two bitstrings are cut for the crossover is a randomly chosen .",
    "one of the two products of the crossover is randomly chosen as a female gamete and then , the male individual at the reproduction age is chosen randomly from the whole pool of , , adult  males in the population .",
    "this male produces its gamete in the same way as a female has done it .",
    "the female and male gametes form the diploid genome of an offspring , its sex - male / female is set with an equal probability . in the next mcs",
    "its first locus will be checked for the genetic status of its bits ( genes ) . in one mcs",
    "an age of all individuals increases by one and each female at the reproduction age can give a birth to a new baby with a probability @xmath6 or can give a birth of @xmath6 new babies .",
    "there is another mechanism controlling the birth rate in the model .",
    "it is a logistic equation of verhulst : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of individuals in the population in the @xmath9-step of simulation , @xmath10 is a maximal size of the population called also a capacity of the environment and @xmath11 is a probability that a new offspring will survive its birth .",
    "in fact there are only seven parameters in the standard penna model :    * @xmath0 - the number of loci , * @xmath4 - the average number of mutations introduced into the haploid genome during the gamete production ( usually @xmath4=1 per haploid genome per generation ) , * @xmath6 - the number of offspring produced by each female at reproduction age at each time step or the probability of giving the offspring , * @xmath2 - minimum reproduction age , * @xmath1 - the upper limit of expressed defects , at which an individual dies , * @xmath5 - the probability of a crossover between parental haplotypes during the gamete production , * @xmath11 - the verhulst factor @xmath12 .",
    "there are many possibilities of starting the simulations .",
    "usually we start with randomly generated population of half of @xmath10 size with perfect genomes ( all bits set for 0 ) .",
    "randomly generated means here evenly distributed age of individuals and equal numbers of females and males . during the simulation , a mutational pressure introduces mutations into haplotypes while a selection tends to eliminate them .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the distribution of defective genes in the genomes in equilibrium . among the genes expressed before the minimum reproduction age ( @xmath2 )",
    "the fraction of defective alleles is the lowest .",
    "after @xmath2 the fraction of defective genes grows with the age of their expression , eventually reaching 1 for the late ages which means that there are no functional genes in the whole genetic pool which could be necessary for surviving during those late periods of life .",
    "such a distribution of defective genes determines the age structure of populations .",
    "the mortality of the youngest individuals is the lowest and it is growing with age .",
    "the position of the first genes which are set in the whole population for 1 determines the maximum life span of individuals in the population .",
    "more precisely , the maximum life expectancy is ( @xmath1-@xmath13 ) steps longer than indicated by the position of the first locus set to 1 .",
    "distribution of defective genes ( bits set to 1 ) in the genetic pool of virtual penna populations - top panel , and age distribution of the corresponding population - lower panel .",
    "the age corresponds to the number of mc steps and to the number of bits switched on .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]    note that in these populations individuals can reproduce with equal probability to the end of life .",
    "thus , the results support the medawar hypothesis of ageing assuming that even if individuals can reproduce to the end of their life , their impact on the total reproduction potential of population decreases and selection does nt care about their genetic status allowing the accumulation of mutations in genes expressed during the late periods of life .      [ [ random - death ] ] random death + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the most important factors in the population simulations is the method of keeping the stable size of populations .",
    "there are two factors in the penna model : birth rate @xmath6 and verhulst factor @xmath11 responsible for that .",
    "the birth rate has to be set high enough to secure at least the replacement of fraction of dying individuals in the evolving populations .",
    "a higher birth rate leads to the roughly exponential growth of population and that is why the logistic equation of verhulst is introduced .",
    "deaths due to verhulst factor may be introduced in a few different ways and it is very important if this factor kills the individuals randomly during their lifespan or at birth only @xcite .",
    "we set the verhulst factor only for newborns which means that each newborn is additionally tested by verhulst factor for surviving .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the difference in distribution of defective genes in the genetic pool of populations evolving with differently operating verhulst factors .",
    "the difference in distribution of defective genes in the genetic pool of populations evolving under verhulst factor operating at birth only ( stars ) or `` killing '' all individual independently of their age ( circles).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    one can wonder why the random death could affect the populations so differently .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "one is that random death killing at birth kills individuals independently of their genetic status .",
    "if it kills individuals during their lifespan then , the older individuals have to pass the tests of their genomes several times .",
    "these older organisms have larger fraction of their genomes correct which has been testified directly by their age .",
    "the other conclusion is that the random death weakens the selection for genetic status of individuals .",
    "in fact , in nature such a random death operates mainly at very early stages of development or at very late periods of life .",
    "[ [ threshold - t ] ] threshold t + + + + + + + + + + +    the average life expectancy , which supposes to mirror the population s health , rose dramatically during the 20th century .",
    "the most striking example is east asia , where the life expectancy at birth increased from less than 45 years in 1950 to more than 72 years nowadays ( it means that it was increasing by six months each year ! ) .",
    "so far , however , japanese women enjoy the longest expectation of life : it approached 85 years in 2003 , in comparison to 63 years in 1950 and 44 years in 1900 @xcite .",
    "this outstanding achievement of our civilization becomes a challenge .",
    "combined with the decrease in fecundity ( number of children born by one woman ) , it has brought the global ageing of the human population and fears of pension crises .",
    "such deep demographic changes strongly influence the economic , educational and social policies .",
    "therefore , there is an urgent need for correct forecasts of expectation of life for future decades .",
    "unfortunately , there is no agreement among scientists in these predictions .    *",
    "how much can the human life span be extended ?",
    "*    this question could have many contexts .",
    "it can be understood more philosophically as the quest for the truth about the possibility of physical immortality . in other words",
    ": whether we are biologically designed to die and nothing can be done about it or rather , putting stop to ageing is only the matter of time and eventually human beings will live forever , unless killed by random death .",
    "more practical , however , this is a question about the demographic trends in the coming decades , and there are at least two schools which aspire to answer it .",
    "they are characterized by different points of view on current human populations demographic trends and predict different future demographic scenarios .    * adding life to years ... ; * the first idea , developed by fries @xcite , is rooted in the conviction that there is an inherent limit imposed on the human longevity by biology , which determines the maximal life span .",
    "consequently , there must also be a ceiling to human life expectancy .",
    "fries even assessed the position and shape of the , , ideally rectangular survival curve  , which would be the result of the hypothetical elimination of all premature deaths , and set ultimate life expectancy level at 85 years .",
    "the intuitive consequence of this process of rectangularization should be the so called compression of morbidity . if the onset of infirmity is postponed ( e.g. by changes in lifestyle or improvements in medicine ) , the period with the debilitating effects of illness or disability reduces , because of the fixed maximum age .",
    "this concept predicts that increasing life expectancy should not result in the extension of morbidity : in , , ever older , ever more feeble , and ever more expensive - to - care - for populace ",
    "@xcite , but rather in the compression of infirmity into a short period prior to death , associated with the reduction in the scale of health care systems .    summing up",
    ", the presented interpretation of demographic changes may be illustrated using a popular catch - phrase as a process of , , adding life to years  .",
    "there is no place for prophets of physical immortality in this scenario .    * ... or years to life ? *",
    "more and more scientists come to believe that this theory does not properly describe the demographic reality .",
    "oeppen and vaupel @xcite presented a comparison between the forecasts done in the past and real - life development as a story about breaking all the limits predicted by demographers to life expectancy : from 64.75 years calculated as its ultimate level by louis dublin in 1928 to 85 years set again by olshansky et al . in 1990",
    "the main message of their article is that there are no signs that life expectancy is approaching any limit and that the belief in such limits led to underestimation of life expectancy in the past and definitely will not help in forecasting the future trends .",
    "this observation does not discredit the rectangularization hypothesis itself .",
    "as long as the increase in maximum age at death is slower than the increase in average age at death ( life expectancy ) the survival curve will show rectangularization .",
    "but such rectangularization without the belief in the fixed maximum age will not provide us with such a simple and precise answer to what we can expect in the close future as it was in fries scenario .",
    "and reality seems to be even more complicated and difficult to forecast . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the pattern of changes in the survival curve that occurred in the first half of 20th century did show rectangularization .",
    "but scientists report that this trend has been replaced in some countries by a near parallel shift of the curve to the right @xcite .",
    "this leaves the future wide open for speculations .",
    "more generally , some scientists stress the significance of medical interventions and public health as the determinants of mortality changes ; others see their origin mostly in economical , social , cultural and behavioural factors .",
    "nevertheless , one century is a too short period for any significant reconstruction of the genetic pool of the human population , and thus in broad terms the observed mortality transition must have been driven by the changes in the individual / environment relation and thus by the increase in , , threshold value t  , whatever the detailed scenario of this process was .",
    "consequently , it should be possible to simulate the changes in the human population just by increasing the individuals tolerance to the number of expressed defective characters .",
    "since the @xmath1 parameter in the penna model describes the individuals tolerance to the deleterious traits that they suffer from , we used it to model the dynamic of demographic changes @xcite . when @xmath1 is set for one , it means that every single deleterious phenotypic trait kills the individual .",
    "the higher the @xmath1 value means that each individual copes better with its genetic load . in the real world",
    ", this value might correspond to the standard of medical care , lifestyle , diet , hygiene , education and all other factors that help an individual to escape some fatal effects of his genetic traits .",
    "therefore , this is a very capacious parameter and it can be generally interpreted as the factor in charge of the relation between individuals and environment . notice that changes in the age structure of human populations were observed in very short period - in japan it was only 50 years - less than two generations .",
    "there was no time for rebuilding the genetic pool of populations .",
    "thus , all changes suppose to correspond to relations between the environment and populations .",
    "that is why we used for these studies the populations in the equilibrium and then we have changed the values of t parameter @xcite .    the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] show the role of changes of the @xmath1 parameter values . in these series of simulations populations evolved under the values of parameters as follows : @xmath0 = 640 , @xmath2 = 200 , @xmath6 = 0.25 , @xmath10 = 50 000 , @xmath5 = 1 .",
    "populations were allowed to evolve for 80 000 mc steps under the threshold @xmath1 = 3 .",
    "then , one million zygotes were produced and the life span of each zygote was anticipated without further evolution , just on the basis of their genetic load .",
    "this was repeated for different values of parameter @xmath1 . when these values were not integers , the probability of surviving under a given @xmath1 was equal to a fractional part of @xmath1 , which means that individuals under threshold @xmath1 = 3.3 had a probability 0.7 to die when three bad mutations were reached . in this way",
    "the anticipated age distributions of individuals for different thresholds @xmath1 were prepared and plotted in fig .",
    "the increase of the threshold @xmath1 value leads to the rectangularization of the curve describing the age distribution of the population with relatively small shift of the maximum age to the right .",
    "comparison of these results with the data from the real swedish population shows that the increase in the @xmath1 value can mimic the demographic changes in the age distribution of the human population .",
    "data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are based on those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] but the x - axis has been rescaled to fit the human life span ; the period from 20 - 100 years in the human life span corresponds to the period from minimum reproduction age @xmath2 = 200 to the maximum age in simulations .",
    "plots generated by simulations fit very well the age distribution of human populations of second half of the 19th century and part of the 20th century @xcite .",
    "however , for the end of the 20th century and for the latest data rectangularization shown by simulations seems to be too strong .",
    "the model renders very well the level of mortality in the middle ages but the mortality of the oldest individuals is overestimated .",
    "interestingly , demographers claim that life expectancy at older ages relatively stable so far has increased at a spectacular pace just since the second half of the 20th century .",

    "stauffer blamed for that many natural or social phenomena , like higher somatic mutations rate in the male bodies , stress or altruism of men - they have to fight for peace .",
    "but there could be one more reason - male are hemizygous in respect to x chromosome - they possess only one copy of that chromosome in their genome where about 5% of all genes ( in the human genome ) are localized .",
    "women possess two copies of the x chromosome .",
    "it is very important for phenotypic expression of the defective genes located on the x chromosomes .",
    "if man has a defective gene on its copy of x chromosome , the phenotypic defective trait would be expressed .",
    "the same defective gene on one copy of x chromosome in the woman genome could be complemented by its allele located on the other copy of x chromosome .    assuming these differences in the genome structure of male and females schneider et al . , and kurdziel et al .",
    ", analysed the age structure of populations with such a sexual dimorphism .",
    "they found , that the differences in mortality of both sexes could be explained by the lack of the second copy of x chromosome in the male genomes .",
    "furthermore , the model predicts higher differences in mortality in the middle ages and almost equal mortality for the oldest groups of individuals , just like in human populations .",
    "note , that in this example authors introduced some genes expressed before the birth .",
    "the fraction of these genes was big enough to introduce so called zygotic death at the level of 60% corresponding to estimations for humans .",
    "it is estimated that a chance for human zygote to survive until birth is of the order of 40% .",
    "thus , this simple hypothesis of the role of x chromosome has been supported by the simulations .",
    "but there is another problem for biologists .",
    "males usually have two sex chromosomes : x and y. there are some premises that originally these two chromosomes were homologous and in the course of evolution the y chromosome has shrunk .",
    "the onody group used the penna model to simulate the evolution of y chromosome and they noticed that it accumulates mutations with higher probability than other chromosomes .",
    "they tried to explain this phenomenon by a specific genetic behaviour of the y chromosome - it does not recombine with counterparts ( in fact it has no counterparts ) and it is cloned and passes only through the male genomes .",
    "nevertheless , it was found that these properties does not explain the phenomenon of the y chromosome shrinking .",
    "let s start the evolution of sex chromosomes in the individuals whose genomes are composed of two pairs of chromosomes - one pair of autosomes ( autosomes - all chromosomes which are not sex chromosomes ) and one pair of sex chromosomes . at the beginning",
    "all chromosomes were identical and evolved exactly according to the standard diploid penna model .",
    "the only difference was a marker glued to one copy of sex chromosomes which determined the male sex ( the chromosome is called y chromosome , from now ) .",
    "thus , if a zygote was formed of two gametes - both transferring the sex chromosomes without that marker ( x chromosomes ) - it was a female . if a zygote got a sex chromosome with that marker - it was a male .",
    "the males could transfer the x chromosome and the y chromosome to the gametes with an equal probability .",
    "autosomes in all genomes and x chromosomes in the female genomes can recombine .",
    "the result of simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "after relatively short time of evolution , the y chromosome accumulated defective genes and eventually the only genetic information it possessed was the determination of the male sex - the marker glued to the chromosome .",
    "the other effect of evolution was lower fraction of defective genes in the x chromosome comparing to the autosomes and the most important - the differences in the age structures and mortalities curves of males and females - females lived longer and the difference in mortality was the highest at the middle ages .",
    "the lower fraction of defective genes in x chromosomes is a result of more effective elimination of defects from these chromosomes by males where all defective genes play role of dominant defective mutations .",
    "is the cloning the only reason for shrinking y chromosome ?",
    "in such versions of the modelling the evolution , populations are usually panmictic - females can freely choose a male partner from the whole pool of males in the reproduction age available in the population .",
    "additionally , male after reproducing with one female is going back to the pool of males .",
    "thus , one male individual can reproduce several times during the one time unit while each female can reproduce only once in the time step .",
    "this property of panmictic population has been changed - male individual after reproduction could not go back to the pool of males in the population , it has to be faithful to its female for whole life .",
    "this simple change dramatically changed the fate of y chromosome .",
    "the y chromosome does not shrink any more .",

    ", one has to assume that it is profitable .",
    "thus , it should be possible to observe self organization of recombination rate during the simulation of the population evolution . at the beginning of simulations , one pair of autosomes , x - x pair and x - y pair of sex chromosomes recombined with an equal frequency 0.5 .",
    "the newborns inherited the recombination rate as an average of both parents but this inherited value of recombination rate could be changed in their genomes by + /-",
    "0.01 independently for each pair of chromosomes . during the evolution ,",
    "the recombination rate between autosomes and between x chromosomes increased and fluctuated around one crossover event per gamete production while the recombination between x and y chromosome was switched off very fast ( it stayed at the low level corresponding to the fluctuations caused by the increment of its changes ) .    * the role of the crossover rate for the strategies of evolution * in the standard diploid penna model recombination between the bitstrings mimics the crossover and usually it is assumed that the frequency of crossover is 1 per bitstrings pair during the gamete production .",

    "the frequency of defects reaches 0.5 .",

    "<S> we describe the simulation method of modeling the population evolution using monte carlo based on the penna model . </S>",
    "<S> individuals in the populations are represented by their diploid genomes . </S>",
    "<S> genes expressed after the minimum reproduction age are under a weaker selection pressure and accumulate more mutations than those expressed before the minimum reproduction age . </S>",
    "<S> the generated gradient of defective genes determines the ageing of individuals and age - structured populations are very similar to the natural , sexually reproducing populations . </S>",
    "<S> the genetic structure of a population depends on the way how the random death affects the population . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement of the medical care and healthier life styles are responsible for the increasing of the life expectancy of humans during the last century . introducing a noise into the relations between the genotype , phenotype , and environment , it is possible to simulate some other effects , like the role of immunological systems and a mother care . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most interesting results was the evolution of sex chromosomes . </S>",
    "<S> placing the male sex determinants on one chromosome of a pair of sex chromosomes is enough to condemn it for shrinking if the population is panmictic ( random - mating is assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> if males are indispensable for taking care of their offspring and have to be faithful to their females , the male sex chromosome does not shrink . </S>"
