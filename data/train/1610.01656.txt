    "many systems in nature possess a multitude of coexisting stable states for a given set of parameters reflecting environmental conditions .",
    "this phenomenon called multistability has been studied for decades because of its dynamical complexity arising from the coexistence of the different states ( for a review cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "examples can be found in various disciplines of science , such as pattern recognition in neuroscience @xcite , nonlinear optics with different phenomena in lasers @xcite and coupled lasers @xcite or manifested in different outcomes in chemical reactions despite large care taken to realize the same initial conditions @xcite . since the multitude of coexisting states can usually be related to different performances of the system , various control strategies have been developed to gear the system from one state to another in a prescribed way or to avoid states which correspond to undesired behavior of a system ( for a review cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , during the last decade , the study of systems possessing only two alternative stable states has gained increasing interest due to their importance particularly in climate science and ecology ( cf .",
    "reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been recognized that one of the great challenges to science consists in understanding critical transitions or shifts in dynamics or properties arising in natural systems as a response to global change .",
    "such transitions , in ecology often called catastrophic or regime shifts , are in general related to either changes in the dominance of particular species resulting in different ecosystem services or even in loss of biodiversity @xcite .",
    "more specific alternative stable states have been identified in several limnic and marine ecosystems such as kelp forests @xcite , coral reefs @xcite , shallow lakes @xcite , seagrass meadows @xcite , where the alternatives are usually between the dominance of the native species like kelp , corals or seagrass and the undesired states dominated by algae .",
    "also in terrestrial ecosystems such as the sahara @xcite or more general semiarid ecosystems @xcite , in which the two alternative stable states are a vegetated and a desert state .    in climate science , where these transitions are often called tipping points ,",
    "several components of the climate system have been identified to be possibly vulnerable with respect to certain perturbations @xcite .",
    "such tipping elements are related to several climate phenomena such as elnino - southern oscillation @xcite , the indian monsoon @xcite , the arctic and antarctic ice covers @xcite .",
    "additionally , as one of the first climate components , the thermohaline ocean circulation has been found to possess two alternative stable states , one of which related to the present climate with a large transport of heat to the northern latitudes and the other one corresponding to a shut - down of the circulation consequently ceasing the heat transport @xcite . as a part of the thermohaline ocean circulation , local deep ocean convection is also vulnerable to a shut down @xcite . both processes ,",
    "the shut - down of thc on a global scale and deep - ocean convection on a local scale would have a large impact on the climate in the northern hemisphere leading finally to a cooling in northern- and western europe .",
    "the indian monsoon is expected to become more wet or more dry depending on which of the processes responsible for such changes like increasing albedo due to aerosol concentration or stronger el nino s , respectively , are dominant in the future @xcite .",
    "another highly debated tipping point relates to the tendency of the arctic ice sheets to become thinner and finally to lead to an ice - free state in summer @xcite . finally , we mention the different approaches to study the recurrent switchings of ice ages and warmer climates before the holocene , which are attributed to several stable states and transitions between them @xcite .",
    "different scenarios are discussed in literature that lead to such critical transitions .",
    "on the one hand , changes in the environmental forcing , e.g. atmospheric temperatures or altered precipitation patterns can induce such transitions by reaching a critical threshold at which one of the states loses its stability and the system switches to another state . in mathematical terms , this scenario is related to a bifurcation ; the combination of two such bifurcations often comprises a hysteresis @xcite allowing for a switching between two alternative states , when a control parameter is varied @xcite .",
    "when two stable states coexist , then a switching between them is mediated by fluctuations leading to noise - induced transitions @xcite .    due to the increasing concerns about such critical transitions on our planet earth , there is an urgent need to identify the approach of a regime shift or a tipping point before its occurrence . such early warning signals ,",
    "if applicable , can be used to anticipate the transition and to take measures to slow down the approach in the worst case or to avoid it if the expected alternative state is for some reason undesired .",
    "such avoidance might not always be possible , particularly not in the climate system , but early warnings could be used to take political actions . during the last decade several methods have been developed to gain more insights into how to predict abrupt changes in the system dynamics , induced by its nonlinearity.one of the earliest measures identified is related to the time which is needed to respond to perturbations . while far away from the critical threshold , such perturbations die out quite quickly , this damping becomes significantly slower in the neighborhood of a threshold @xcite .",
    "the perturbation applied can be either a single perturbation or some noise which is inevitable in experiments and in natural processes . in case of a single prescribed perturbation ,",
    "this measure is easy to implement in experiments and therefore widely used in quantifying the distance to the threshold value . in case of a noisy system",
    "the approach of the critical threshold can be quantified by an increasing variance and autocorrelation @xcite . as a second effect noise leads to an irregular switching process between the two ( or more ) alternative stable states .",
    "this process is called flickering @xcite , attractor hopping @xcite or chaotic itinerancy @xcite depending on the context in which it is studied .",
    "hence , a second indicator has been introduced measuring this flickering or hopping process , which occurs in a bistable ( or multistable ) region in parameter space in which two or more stable states coexist .",
    "it is important to note that the hopping dynamics depends on the noise strength .",
    "while a large body of work is devoted to the impact of additive noise , many processes in nature , particularly in ecosystems , are affected by multiplicative noise , which has only rarely been considered .",
    "it has to be emphasized that environmental noise in ecosystem dynamics is always multiplicative and plays by far the more important role @xcite .",
    "however , most of the previous work on indicators for critical thresholds is restricted to additive noise describing the impact of fluctuations on physical processes in the climate system , but being of limited value for ecological problems .",
    "many bistable systems considered in nature possess two stable equilibria , i.e. the system is stationary .",
    "for the above mentioned example of shallow lakes , the water in the lake loses transparency by shifting abruptly from a clear to a turbid state when a threshold in the level of nutrients is reached . as a result of this eutrophication process ,",
    "submerged plants dramatically disappear beyond a tipping point @xcite . for the example of desertification ,",
    "rainfall patterns are the essential environmental conditions determining the shift from a perennial vegetation via localized vegetation patterns to the state of bare soil . moreover ,",
    "taking the grazing pressure by livestock in the sahel zone into account , leads again to a shift from a perennial to an annual vegetation @xcite .",
    "however , in analyzing the regime shift in the respective ecosystems , the periodic input of nutrients and precipitation due to the seasonal cycle has been neglected , but could have an important impact too .",
    "the same argument applies to the analysis of physical processes in the climate system driven by periodic or quasi - periodic changes in the orbital parameters of the sun leading to a variation in solar insolation with periods of about @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 years , the well - known milankovitch cycles @xcite .",
    "particularly the latter are assumed to be the major drivers for the development of the ice - ages before the holocene @xcite .",
    "recently , these periodic forcings affecting the albedo of the earth are studied to evaluate the impact of this variation on the arctic and antarctic ice cover @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on tipping points and regime shifts of periodically forced systems . in this class of systems ,",
    "abrupt changes of the dynamics at critical transitions do not occur between steady states ( equilibria ) , but between oscillating states ( limit cycles ) .",
    "though at first sight , the hysteresis curves which are usually drawn to discuss critical transitions look similar , however , the dynamics is quite different . for this scenario",
    "we show that a transient structure , a so - called channel , occurring in the system s state space beyond the tipping point , creates a short - term dynamical regime with specific properties which attenuates the criticality of the transition .",
    "the smoothing of the transition is demonstrated by computing a finite - time measure of the twisting behavior ( rotation property ) of the state space surrounding trajectories while inside the channel domain .",
    "this measure indicates that , the trajectories passing the channel beyond the tipping point have residual system properties of the limit cycle destroyed at that tipping point .",
    "hence , the channel acts as a  ghost \" of the destroyed limit cycle , retaining system trajectories in a very similar fashion .",
    "this fact is shown by statistical analysis of the intervals of time spent by noisy trajectories in the neighborhood of the limit cycle ( pre - tipping ) and the channel ( post - tipping ) . furthermore , we attribute to the ghost state the inconclusive diagnostic provided by variance and autocorrelation in anticipating tipping points .",
    "let us now indicate the differences in the dynamical approach to deal with limit cycles instead of asymptotic equilibria .",
    "figure  [ schematic1 ] shows the typical bifurcation diagram used to explain the appearance and disappearance of the coexistence of two alternative states .",
    "in contrast to the usual diagrams , the lines denote here one point of a limit cycle instead of stationary points .",
    "therefore , the y - axis does not show one coordinate of the stationary state of the system , but one coordinate of the poincar section , a special construction which is very useful in analyzing periodic solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems ( see methods section ) .",
    "the poincar section in a periodically forced system defines a stroboscopic map in which the system is always analyzed at the same phase of the forcing , i.e. at times @xmath3 .",
    "hence , a limit cycle corresponds to a fixed point in this stroboscopic map which makes the similarity between fig .",
    "[ schematic1 ] and the well - known sketches of bistability in the stationary case obvious .",
    "there are two saddle - node or fold bifurcations of limit cycles denoted by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , at which two limit cycles , a stable and an unstable one , emerge or disappear .",
    "crossing those tipping points the dynamics will change dramatically . increasing the parameter value @xmath6 , the continuation of the limit cycle on the upper branch will stop abruptly at @xmath5 and switch to a periodic behavior corresponding to the lower branch ,",
    "while decreasing the parameter @xmath6 and continuing the lower branch will result in a transition to the upper one at the critical threshold @xmath4 .",
    "our main focus lies in the analysis of the regions around those critical transitions .",
    "firstly , we address the question to what extent the usual criteria of critical slowing down and flickering will signal the approach to the transition ( blue region ) .",
    "secondly , we show that the critical transitions are hidden due to particular structures in state space , so - called channels , which appear in the neighborhood of the fold bifurcations of limit cycles , preventing a clear identification of the critical transitions .     and @xmath5 , which are the tipping points .",

    "the green color regions indicate parameters where a channel associated to fold bifurcations is formed.,width=321,height=245 ]",

    "in summary , we address tipping points of systems subjected to periodic external forcing . the asymptotic solutions of this class of systems inherently settle into oscillating stable states ( limit cycles ) , a more complex dynamics than the stable steady states ( equilibria ) for which the tipping points have been widely studied . in nature , the most noticeable occurrences of such oscillating attractors are found in ecology and climate sciences where periodic and quasi - periodic variabilities arise from external factors such as seasonality and astronomical forcing . here , for a generic periodically forced system that generates such oscillations , we consider the typical hysteretic scenario to investigate tipping points , i.e. , a bistable parameter region where the tipping is represented by fold bifurcations of limit cycles rather than steady states . as",
    "the parameters are varied and the system reaches a fold bifurcation , in which a stable limit cycle is destroyed leaving a transient structure , a so - called channel , in the state space of the system . hence , for parameters beyond this tipping point , the channel gives rise to a short - term dynamics which possesses similar properties than the destroyed limit cycle and can therefore be attributed to a `` ghost '' of the latter .",
    "we find that a residual dynamical property of the limit cycle destroyed in the tipping point , namely its twisting behavior , occurs in the short - term dynamics for parameters in the post - tipping region .",
    "this finding indicates that the short - term behavior carries dynamical information of the destroyed oscillating stable state .    for system parameters fixed in the post - tipping region ,",
    "we obtain the time evolution of the system subject to a stochastic noise . with this",
    ", we show that the  ghost \" attractor retains systems trajectories in a very similar fashion of the stable limit cycle destroyed in the tipping point . additionally , by obtaining the statistics of the time intervals that noise trajectories spend in the neighborhood of the stable limit cycle and in the neighborhood of the  ghost \" , we find that the pdfs of waiting times in both regions have the same exponential profile and do not differ much in their expected values .",

    "the emergence of the ' ' ghost \" masks the transition until the system is well beyond the tipping point and makes it to appear smooth instead of catastrophic .",
    "as we consider systems whose asymptotic behavior are _ limit cycles _ , the final dynamics are oscillations rather than equilibria .",
    "bifurcation analysis are performed by defining a poincar section , which usually is a hyper - surface arranged transversally to the limit cycle , where the whole system dynamics is described by a discrete system .",
    "letting @xmath61 be the function that describes the intersections of the limit cycle with the section , for trajectories in three dimensional space , results that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the coordinates of the @xmath64 crossing .",
    "consequently , on the surface of section , limit cycles are represented by _ fixed points _ of @xmath61 .",
    "then , states , as shown in bifurcation diagrams such as of fig .",
    "[ schematic1 ] , are defined in the surface of section , and in case the section is chosen to be a plane , they are denoted by the ( @xmath65,@xmath66 ) plane coordinates .    for the duffing oscillator described by eq .",
    "( [ ecomodel ] ) , a suitable poincar section is the so - called @xmath19-shift .",
    "the dynamics over the section is represented by discrete variables ( @xmath18,@xmath67 ) defined as the solution pair ( @xmath20 , @xmath31 ) collected every period , @xmath14 .      in case of limit cycles ,",
    "a risky bistable configuration occurs when two _ stable limit cycles _ are coexisting with one _ unstable cycle of saddle type_. the emergence of a dynamical channel at this scenario can be described on a suitable poincar section .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ schematic3](@xmath54 ) that the stable limit cycles yield two fixed points of the _ node type _ ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath16 in the surface of section , while the unstable limit cycle generates a fixed point of _ saddle type_. the stable manifold of the saddle separates the initial conditions attracted by each node ( blue and red in fig .  [ schematic3](@xmath54 ) ) . as the control parameters are varied approaching the fold bifurcation that delimitate the bistability region , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ schematic1 ] , one of the node fixed points approaches the saddle .",
    "when the system is set to the parameters at the fold bifurcation point , for instance , the node @xmath16 and the saddle collide , and they both disappear forming an elliptic fixed point denoted by @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ schematic3](@xmath36 ) . for post - bifurcation parameters , the schematic of the poincar section",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic3](@xmath38 ) , the node and the saddle no longer exist in the poincar section .",
    "however , trajectories starting in the space state region , which used to be the basin of attraction of the destroyed node @xmath16 , converge to the remaining node but not before being attracted by the stable manifold of the unstable elliptic point .",
    "effectively , the system s trajectory behaves as if there existed a channel constraining the trajectory and leading it to the remaining stable state .",
    "the occurrence of these dynamical channels related to fold bifurcations of limit cycles has been first discussed by pomeau and manneville , and has been argued to be the mechanism responsible for the laminar phase in the type-@xmath44 intermittency scenario @xcite . however , in type-@xmath44 intermittency , chaotic bursts re - inject the trajectory in the dynamical channel .",
    "the trajectory spends long time intervals to cross the channel ( the laminar phase ) eventually escaping to the chaotic phase space region , producing another chaotic burst . in this work , there is no chaotic process to re - inject the trajectory into the channel , so we introduce a gaussian noise which resets the trajectory to a random configuration belonging to the basin of attraction of the stable state extinct in the fold bifurcation .",
    "this procedure successively ejects the trajectory off the neighborhood of the survival stable state , forcing it to successively cross the channel along its time evolution .",
    "regardless of the mechanism used to re - inject the trajectory through the channel , the time spent by trajectories to cross depends on the distance @xmath39 from the fold bifurcation as @xcite :    @xmath68      in general , the state space in the neighborhood of a limit cycle is affected by its presence , commonly , the limit cycle induces a twisting in its neighboring space .",
    "this twisting can be quantified by computing the so called _ generalized winding number _",
    "( gwn ) . given a limit cycle @xmath69 of the duffing oscillator described by eq .",
    "( [ ecomodel ] ) , the gwn of @xmath69 can be obtained by computing the average frequency @xmath70 of the twisting that a neighbor trajectory @xmath71 performs around @xmath69 @xcite . defining @xmath72 as the angle between @xmath69 and @xmath71 over the @xmath19-shift poincar ' e section , the frequency",
    "is given by : @xmath73 and , the gwn is @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath8 is the frequency of the forcing in eq .",
    "( [ ecomodel ] ) .    hence , eq .  ( [ eq : inffreq ] ) and ( [ eq : infwind ] ) allow us to compute the gwn of the two coexisting stable states of the bistable region ( between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig .  [ figure1 ] )",
    "for each stable state a gwn can be calculated considering sets of initial conditions belonging to the basin of attraction of each state .",
    "since these states are attractors , trajectories naturally go to the neighborhood of the stable limit cycles , providing a gwn based on the local properties of the limit cycles .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : inffreq ] ) is defined for an infinitely long time , in a manner that the main contribution to the averaged twisting frequency @xmath70 comes from rotations of the asymptotic stable state .",
    "hence , to obtain twisting properties of transitory structures , eq .",
    "( [ eq : inffreq ] ) has to be reformulated in a finite time version .",
    "so , we define a finite - time twisting frequency as :    @xmath75    for short - term trajectories we have to consider possible deviations in the finite - time winding number for different initial conditions .",
    "hence , we take an average over an ensemble of initial conditions , resulting in the follow definition for the finite - time winding numbers : @xmath76 where the brackets denote the average over the ensemble of trajectories . as long the time to cross the channel , @xmath77 ,",
