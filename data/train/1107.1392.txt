    "high energy ( x - ray , @xmath3-ray ) emission is observed from numerous astronomical sources and is produced by various processes .",
    "common sources of high energy emission are galactic sources such as black hole or neutron star systems ( e.g. , x - ray binaries , pulsars ) and supernovae or supernova remnants , and extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . at lower energies ( @xmath4kev ) ,",
    "thermal emission may make a significant contribution to the observed flux but at greater energies , such as those observed by the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics satellite _",
    "( integral ; 15kev - 10mev ; ) , other emission mechanisms are required .",
    "prominent , though certainly not the only emission mechanisms at these energy ranges are synchrotron and inverse compton radiation which both produce broad - band spectra visible over many orders of magnitude in frequency .    in this letter",
    "we collate data of one such integral  detected , high energy object , igrj17448 - 3232 , from various sources including published catalogs , archived images and our own eso - ntt observations ( section [ section : observations ] ) .",
    "we identify the multi - wavelength counterparts of the point source and construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ; section [ section : spectra ] ) in an attempt to understand its nature .",
    "* igrj17448 - 3232*[section : introduction - igr ] + the x - ray source igrj17448 - 3232  was initially discovered by integral and published in the third ( iii ) and subsequently fourth ( iv ) ibis / isgri soft gamma - ray survey catalog @xcite , though at slightly different positions . in an attempt to refine the position ( see table[table : xrays ] for this and subsequent x - ray positions ) , the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) observed the field @xcite .",
    "these authors identify a point source ( henceforth swiftj174437.5 - 323220 ) at the edge of the original integral  iii error circle as well as possible diffuse emission ( which , after examination of the xrt image , we note is within that error circle ) . the position of the point source was further refined by @xcite through a 4.7ks _ chandra _  observation of the field .",
    "in addition to detecting the point source , cxouj174437.3 - 323222 , they confirmed an extended source , @xmath5 times brighter , at the integral  iii position ( cxouj174453.4 - 323254 , see figure[fig:24um ] ) . at the xrt point source position ,",
    "@xcite had also noted a usno - b1.0 ( 0574 - 0773466 , @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , 2mass ( j17443749 - 3232197 , @xmath7 ; @xcite ) object but the sub - arcsecond accuracy of the _ chandra _  position eliminates it as a possible counterpart ; though the x - ray point source is at the edge of the 2mass point spread function ( psf ) .    due to the fact that the more recent integral  iv position includes both the point source and extended emission within its error circle we shall henceforth only use igrj17448 - 3232  to refer to the field and , for clarity",
    ", we shall refer to the extended emission as cxouj174453.4 - 323254 . given the positional coincidence and point source nature of swiftj174437.5 - 323220   and cxouj174437.3 - 323222",
    "we shall henceforth assume they are one source which we shall refer to by the _ chandra _  moniker .",
    "based on analysis of the _ chandra _  spectrum , @xcite proposed the extended emission as a supernova remnant ( snr ) , though they did not detect evidence of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "they also suggested a tentative association of the point source with the snr , hypothesizing that it may be an isolated neutron star that received a kick when the supernova occurred .",

    "the infrared flux densities in jansky ( jy ) , @xmath8 , at frequency @xmath9 ( table[obs ] ) were first converted to flux per filter , @xmath10 in units of photons@xmath11s@xmath12 .",
    "this is done via @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the effective wavelength and width of the filter in question .",
    "xspec compatible files are then produced using the ftool , flx2xsp . within xspec , the infrared , _ swift _",
    "uvot and _ chandra _  x - ray @xcite data were initially fit by a single power law where interstellar extinction and absorption were modeled by redden and phabs respectively .",
    "however , this model gave an unsatisfactory fit ( @xmath17 for 16 degrees of freedom ) , namely due to a clear excess of emission at energies @xmath18kev that could not be accounted for by any possible pile - up .",
    "including an additional , purely phenomenological , power law component produces an improvement ( @xmath19 ) of the fit with power law and extinction / absorption parameters similar to those of the initial fit .",
    "the best fit ( figure[fig : sed ] ) gives a broadband spectral index , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) from infrared to x - ray of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 confidence ) , as well as a secondary spectral index ( not plotted ) to account for the excess emission @xmath18kev which can only be constrained to be within the range @xmath24 .",
    "unabsorbed x - ray fluxes and flux densities were calculated in five energy bins : 0.31 , 12 , 23 , 35 and 510 kev .",
    "the optical extinction is fit as @xmath25 and the equivalent hydrogen column density as @xmath26@xmath11 , greater than the galactic value of @xmath27@xmath11 .",
    "these should be treated with caution due to the small range over which they are calculated and , in the case of extinction , the lack of sensitivity at those wavelengths .",
    "it is also worth noting that the best fit optical extinction is well below that of the galactic value , @xmath28 @xcite , though this should be treated with caution as estimates of the extinction so close to the galactic plane ( @xmath29@xmath30 ) are unreliable . the measured column density to the source implies an optical extinction @xcite of @xmath31 , well in excess of the observed value , which suggests an intrinsic excess of @xmath32 at the source .    the _ planck",
    "limits imply that the spectrum breaks at a frequency , @xmath33 : @xmath34hz , i.e. , between the _ planck _  and _",
    "spitzer _  frequencies , though the exact value will depend on the sharpness of the break . the flattest possible spectral index , @xmath20 at low frequencies is @xmath35 .",
    "the upper limits are also consistent with a steepest possible ( physical ) spectral slope of @xmath36 .",
    "we detect an ir point source , with no evidence for extended emission , at the x - ray position of cxouj174437.3 - 323222 , the x - ray point source in the field of igrj17448 - 3232 .",
    "the probability of chance superposition , even in this crowded field , is relatively low at 11% in the @xmath0 band , or only 3% for a source of this magnitude or brighter , and lower ( 1 - 4% ) in the more sparsely populated glimpse  fields .",
    "as x - ray flux measurements from _ swift_-xrt and _ chandra _  are consistent , we can assume that the source is relatively persistent , though we can not rule out variability .",
    "the ir to x - ray sed displays a single power law , with only a suggestion of excess emission above @xmath37kev ( this single power law sed derived from non - contemporaneous archive / catalog values is another argument against a significantly variable source ) .",
    "there is no evidence in the sed for any thermal emission at any frequency in the observed bands .",
    "the spectral index of the power law , @xmath38 , could correspond to the expected spectral slope of synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons ; such electrons , accelerated to a power - law energy distribution , @xmath39 with a cut - off at low energies , are expected , under standard assumptions , to emit high energy photons with a spectral index of @xmath40 up to the cooling break frequency , which is due to the finite synchrotron - emitting lifetimes of the electrons , and @xmath41 thereafter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the electron energy distribution index , @xmath42 , is thought to have a value of @xmath43 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so the observed value of @xmath38 could correspond to a value of @xmath44 for observations above the cooling frequency , though this is only one possible interpretation of the data .",
    "this persistent , single power law emission might be expected from a number of astronomical sources such as agn , persistent x - ray binaries or magnetars but in most of these cases there would be a measurable thermal component , of which there is no evidence of here .",
    "power law emission would also be expected from a snr or pwn but the extended nature of these sources should be observable in either the x - ray or ir / optical , which is not the case ( e.g. , ) . as previously mentioned above , @xcite suggested a tentative association of the point source with the nearby snr , hypothesizing that it may be an isolated neutron star that received a kick when the supernova occurred .",
    "however , a pulsar would not be expected to be so bright in the nir relative to the radio regime , where a detection would be expected but is not the case here .",
    "noting that the source is so close to the galactic center ; if we assume a distance of 8kpc , then the angular separation of 3  ( corresponding to @xmath45pc ) would require @xmath4616,000 years since the super nova ( sn ) , if a pulsar was given a kick velocity of 500kms@xmath12 ( at the high end of the distributions of @xcite ) . at that age we would expect that the sn would have faded significantly which does not seem to be the case , though of course this time can be reduced significantly by reducing the distance to the source . while we can not rule out an association ,",
    "we find it unlikely , and to confirm the point source as a pulsar , associated or not to the snr , x - ray timing analysis is required .",
    "one solution that can explain the emission is that the source is a blazar ( e.g. , ) , an agn with its jet pointing directly at us .",
    "blazars are persistent sources , though it should be noted that they have been observed to undergo flares ( e.g. @xcite ) and high energy rapid variability . in this scenario the emission in a given regime is dominated by synchrotron or inverse compton ( ic ) emission from the jet which , because of its angle towards us , is much brighter than the thermal and other emission associated with the agn .",
    "even though the source is close to the galactic centre , the galactic column density is relatively low in that direction , allowing the emission to be visible through the galaxy .",
    "the excess column density required by the x - ray spectra suggests excess absorption which may be explained by absorption close to the source , though the apparent excess may also be an effect of spectral curvature .",
    "the measured ir and x - ray fluxes of this source , approximate radio limits and spectral slope are all broadly consistent with those of blazars in general @xcite . in this framework",
    "the apparent excess of emission at energies @xmath18kev , which we model , phenomenologically , with a second power law is due to the expected inverse compton emission from blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; either ic emission from the interaction of the synchrotron generated photons with the electrons in the jet ( synchrotron self compton ; ssc ) or from external photons interacting with jet electrons ( external - radiation compton ; erc ) .",
    "however , we can not constrain this excess component from the _ chandra _  spectrum alone and the source is unresolved from the snr in the higher energy bands ( i.e. , _ swift_-bat , integral ) .",
    "tests of this hypothesis require an optical or ir spectrum with which to confirm the extragalactic nature of the source , though blazars are expected to have no or only very weak lines , so it may be the absence of lines , such as those that would be expected from galactic sources , that will add weight to the blazar argument .",
    "additionally , a high level of linear polarisation might be expected if the source is a blazar , due to the synchrotron emission .",
    "however , the main test is a broader - band sed spanning from radio to optical and into the high energy x - rays , which should display the double synchrotron and inverse compton peaks , or at least slopes , and confirm the absence of a thermal component . if this source is confirmed as a blazar , at @xmath47 degrees , while not the first in the galactic plane @xcite , it will be the first identified so close to the galactic centre .",
    "on the basis of positional coincidence and common spectral slope , we have identified a new infrared counterpart to the x - ray point source , cxouj174437.3 - 323222  in the field of igrj17448 - 3232 , visible from 2.2 to 24@xmath2 m .",
    "multi - wavelength spectral modelling shows that the data are consistent with a reddened and absorbed single power law over five orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "this implies non - thermal , possibly synchrotron emission that renders the previous suggestion that this source may be a pulsar , and its association to the extended snr emission , unlikely .",
    "we propose that the emission may be due to a blazar viewed through the plane of the galaxy , and we suggest a number of tests of this hypothesis .",
