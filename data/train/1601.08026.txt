    "thus the hitting time of the origin for the process with drift @xmath162 is larger than the one for the corresponding squared bessel process ( thanks to well known comparison results between one dimensional ito processes , see e.g. @xcite chap.6 , thm 1.1 ) , and since this holds for all @xmath163 , finally is larger than the one of @xmath113 . but as we already saw , @xmath113 never hits the origin for @xmath164 . using again the comparison theorem ( this time with @xmath156 and @xmath165 ) , @xmath110 does not hit the origin in finite time on @xmath166 which is in contradiction with @xmath167 .",
    "actually all we have done in the previous sub subsection is unchanged for @xmath141 , except the conclusion .",
    "indeed @xmath168 reaches the origin but is instantaneously reflected .",
    "so @xmath169 ( on @xmath170 ) can reach the origin too , but is also instantaneously reflected . actually using that @xmath171 together with the feller s explosion test , it is easily seen that @xmath169 will reach the origin with a ( strictly ) positive probability ( presumably equal to one , but this is not important for us ) .",
    "but this instantaneous reflection is not enough for the non explosion of the process @xmath119 , because @xmath172 is @xmath173 valued . before going further in the construction ,",
    "let us notice another important fact : there are no multiple @xmath0-collisions at the same time , i.e. starting from @xmath174 the process lives in @xmath43 at least up to the explosion time @xmath71 .",
    "of course this is meaningful provided @xmath175 .",
    "+ to prove the previous sentence , first look at @xmath176 assuming that @xmath177 and that no other @xmath0-collision happens at time @xmath76 .",
    "it is easily seen that ( just take care that we had an extra factor @xmath0 in our definition of @xmath178 ) @xmath179 so that , defining @xmath180 we get that @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a remaining term we can manage just as we did for @xmath178 . since for @xmath175 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , hence @xmath185 does not hit the origin .",
    "notice that if we consider @xmath186 @xmath0-collisions , the same reasoning is still true , just replacing @xmath187 by @xmath188 , the final equation being unchanged except for @xmath182 .      according to all what precedes what we need",

    "however we will not be able to prove the existence of such a strong solution .",
    "actually we think that it does not exist .",
    "we will thus build some weak solution and show uniqueness in some specific sense",
    ".    this will be the goal of the next sections .",

    "we assume that @xmath303 and that @xmath40 .",
    "our aim is to build a solution starting from any point in @xmath43 , i.e. to get rid of the polar set @xmath244 in the previous sub - section",
    ". the construction will be very similar ( still using dirichlet forms ) but we shall here use one result in @xcite , namely the uniqueness result for a @xmath0 dimensional bessel process .",
    "we can cover @xmath193 by an enumerable union of @xmath324 ( @xmath325 ) .",
    "it is thus immediate that the lemma will be proved once we prove that @xmath326 but we have seen in the previous section that , when the process is in some @xmath324 ( where say @xmath204 ) , the process @xmath327 is larger than or equal to the square of a bessel process @xmath328 of index @xmath56 strictly between @xmath24 and @xmath0 .",
    "but ( see @xcite proof of proposition 1.5 p.442 ) , the time spent at the origin by the latter is equal to @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath329 almost surely .",
    "the same necessarily holds for @xmath330 , hence the result .",
    "we intend now to prove some uniqueness , when starting from a point in @xmath193 . actually , using some standard tools of concatenation of paths , it is enough to look at the behavior of our process starting at some @xmath325 with @xmath204 , up to the exit time of @xmath324 ( or some open non empty subset of @xmath324 ) . in this case",
    "the only difficulty is to control the pair @xmath331 since all other coordinates are defined through smooth coefficients .",
    "of course writing @xmath332 we have that @xmath333 and @xmath334 where @xmath335 and @xmath336 are smooth functions ( in @xmath324 ) , @xmath337 and @xmath338 being two independent @xmath0 dimensional brownian motions .",
    "define @xmath339 as we defined @xmath324 ( see , but replacing @xmath340 by @xmath341 and consider a smoothed version @xmath342 of the indicator of @xmath339 i.e. a smooth non negative function such that @xmath343 we may extend all coefficients ( except @xmath344 ) as smooth compactly supported functions outside @xmath324 , and replace @xmath344 by @xmath345 .",
    "if we can show uniqueness for this new system we will have shown uniqueness up to the exit time of @xmath339 for , and the remaining part of the initial system .",
    "thus , after a standard girsanov transform , we are reduced to prove uniqueness for @xmath349 hence for @xmath350 .",
    "@xmath351 is some type of @xmath0-dimensional skew bessel process with dimension @xmath352 ( see @xcite for the one dimensional version ) .",
    "its squared norm @xmath353 is a squared bessel process of dimension @xmath354 , so that the origin is not polar for the process @xmath350 .",
    "as we did in the previous sub - section , we can directly prove the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric hunt process ( here the reference measure is @xmath355 ) using the associated dirichlet form , and since the origin is not polar , we know the existence of a solution starting from @xmath356 . here we only need @xmath357 , but for the whole construction our initial assumption on @xmath10 is required .",
    "finally we can check that the occupation time formula of lemma [ lemlocal ] is still true .",
    "but as before , if now we have existence starting from every initial point , we only have uniqueness in the sense of symmetric markov processes . to get weak uniqueness",
    "we can use polar coordinates : the squared norm is a squared bessel process , so that strong uniqueness holds ( with the corresponding dimension we are looking at ) ; the polar angle is much tricky to handle .",
    "this is the main goal of lemma 19 in @xcite , and the final weak uniqueness then follows from the proof of theorem 17 in @xcite and the occupation time formula",
    ".    [ remfin ] it can be noticed than this result is out of reach of the method developed by krylov and rckner in @xcite for a general brownian motion plus drift @xmath358 , since it requires that @xmath359 for some @xmath360 . also notice that one can not use standard girsanov transform for solving , since for a @xmath0-dimensional brownian motion starting from the origin ,",
