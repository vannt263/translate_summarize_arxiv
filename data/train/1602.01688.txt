    "last phases of matter accretion of low - to - intermediate mass ( 0.5 - 8 @xmath10 ) young stellar objects ( ysos ) are characterized by magnetospheric accretion events ( shu et al .",
    "optical and near - ir observations have shown that the accretion process proceeds through irregular and rapid outbursts , with amplitudes in the range 0.2@xmath81 magnitudes . however , a small percentage of sources , namely the exor variables ( herbig 1989 ) , undergo much stronger and repetitive outbursts imputed to a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate ( e.g. hartmann & kenyon 1985 , antoniucci et al .",
    "the typical brightness variation is of @xmath2 4@xmath85 magnitudes in the visual band , with a duration from few months to years and a recurrence time of several years . during the outburst phase exor spectra",
    "are characterized by emission line spectra , from which accretion rates of @xmath2 10@xmath11 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 are typically estimated ( e.g. lorenzetti et al .",
    "2009 ; sicilia - aguilar et al . 2012 ; kspl et al . 2011 ; audard et al .",
    "such timescale variability makes exors suitable candidates to perform studies based on evolutionary more than statistical concepts , aimed at answering the following fundamental questions : ( 1 ) which is the mechanism(s ) triggering the intermittent accretion bursts ? ; ( 2 ) how does the mass accretion process eventually halt ? ;",
    "( 3 ) what is the role of bursts in the evolution of the circumstellar disk , especially regarding the formation of proto - planetary systems ?",
    "the poor characterization of the exor class derives not only from the small number of known objects ( around 20@xmath830 objects , e.g. lorenzetti et al . 2012",
    "; audard et al 2014 ) , but also from the lack of a long - term monitoring of the photometric and spectroscopic features of the sources . for these reasons we have started the program exorcism ( exor optical and infrared systematic monitoring , antoniucci et al .",
    "2014 ) , which is based on the 0.3 - 2.5 @xmath12 m photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of about 20 objects , classified as exors or recognized as suitable candidates . given the cadence of exor outbursts , quiescence vs. outburst phases have been rarely observed with instrumentation having the same performances : as a consequence , the results derived for both states are not meaningfully comparable .",
    "this is not the case of v1118 ori , an exor whose long - lasting quiescence phase has been recently investigated ( lorenzetti et al .",
    "2015a , hereafter paper i ) by using an instrumentation similar to that employed for monitoring the outburst presented here .",
    "during the last four decades v1118 ori underwent five outbursts , whose average duration was about a couple of years ( 1982 - 84 , 1988 - 90 , 1992 - 94 , 1997 - 98 , 2004 - 06 ) .",
    "the first four eruptions are reported by parsamian et al .",
    "1993 , garca garca & parsamian 2000 ; herbig 2008 and references therein , whereas the properties shown during the fifth event are illustrated by audard et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2010 ) and lorenzetti et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) . here",
    "we account for the last outburst , which was announced few months ago in a telegram by lorenzetti et al .",
    "( 2015b ) .",
    "we describe in section 2 our optical and near - ir observations ; while in section 3 we analyze and discuss the results .",
    "our concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "near - ir data were obtained with the 1.1 m azt-24 telescope at campo imperatore ( laquila , italy ) equipped with the imager / spectrometer swircam ( dalessio et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is based on a 256@xmath13256 hgcdte picnic array .",
    "@xmath0 photometry was obtained in the period september - december 2015 .",
    "reduction was achieved by using standard procedures for bad pixel cleaning , flat fielding , and sky subtraction .",
    "the results are reported in table  [ tab : tab1 ] and shown in figure[fig : fig1 ] . averaged differences in magnitudes with respect to the last phase of quiescence ( september - october 2014 , paper i ) are @xmath1j=1.23 , @xmath1h=0.92 , @xmath1k=0.99 .",
    "we obtained an optical spectrum with the 8.4 m large binocular telescope ( lbt ) using the multi - object double spectrograph ( mods - pogge et al .",
    "2010 ) on 2015 october 1st and 2nd ( jd 2457296/97 ) .",
    "each of the two observations was performed with the dual grating mode ( blue + red channels , spectral range 0.35@xmath80.95 @xmath12 m ) and integrated 1500 s by using a 0@xmath148 slit ( @xmath15 1500 ) .",
    "each spectral image was independently bias and flat - field corrected , then the sky background was subtracted in the two - dimensional spectral images .",
    "the final spectrum was obtained as the average of the two one - dimensional spectra , each obtained by collapsing the stellar trace in the 2-d image along the spatial direction .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from the spectra of arc lamps , while flux calibration was achieved from observations of spectro - photometric standard stars .",
    "a near - ir spectrum of v1118 ori was obtained with the luci2 instrument at lbt on 2015 october 28th ( jd 2457323 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out with the g200 low - resolution grating coupled with the 1@xmath140 slit .",
    "two datasets were acquired with the standard abba technique using the @xmath16 and @xmath17 filters , for a total integration time of 12 and 8 minutes , respectively .",
    "this provides a final spectrum covering the wavelength range 1.0@xmath82.4 @xmath12 m at @xmath151000 .",
    "the raw spectral images were flat - fielded , sky - subtracted , and corrected for optical distortions in both the spatial and spectral directions .",
    "telluric absorptions were removed using the normalized spectrum of a telluric standard star , after removal of its intrinsic spectral features .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from arc lamps , while flux calibration was based on the photometric data taken in the same span of days .",
    "both optical and near - ir outburst spectra are plotted in figure[fig : fig2 ] together with those obtained during the quiescence phase ( taken from paper i ) .",
    "the light - curve shown in figure[fig : fig1 ] indicates that after a long period of quiescence that lasted about 10 years , v1118 ori is currently in a high - level state .",
    "our observations evidence the beginning of the new outburst between january and september 2015 ; in the subsequent three months the source has remained at an approximately constant level .",
    "the average near - ir color variation with respect to the quiescence state is @xmath1[@xmath18 = 0.3 mag , @xmath1[@xmath19 = @xmath80.06 mag , which is roughly orthogonal to the extinction vector ( see figure4 of paper i ) .",
    "as observed in a number of other classical exors , this implies that extinction variations , although likely present , do not play a major role during the outburst ( see e.g. figure1 of lorenzetti et al .",
    "2012 ) . indeed , also in the occasion of the 2005 outburst , when the near - ir colors were very similar to the present ones , audard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) did not measure significant extinction variations from the quiescence to the outburst phase . by means of the x - rays column density",
    ", they estimated a@xmath20 @xmath2 1@xmath82 mag , which are assumed also by us in the present work . a rough estimate of the optical magnitudes has been retrieved from the mods spectrum .",
    "the continuum level increases by a factor between @xmath2 40 and 4 passing from @xmath21 to @xmath22 band .",
    "approximate @xmath23 magnitudes in outburst ( quiescence ) are @xmath21=15.8 ( 19.8 ) , @xmath24=15.8 ( 19.1 ) , @xmath25=15.0 ( 18.0 ) , @xmath26=14.2 ( 16.9 ) , @xmath22=13.3 ( 14.8 ) .",
    "given that the seeing during the nights of the observations never exceeded 11 , no significant flux losses have occurred , so the uncertainties on the estimated magnitudes are below 0.10 - 0.15 mag .",
    "the [ @xmath27 , [ @xmath28 colors change from 0.7 and 1.1 mag in quiescence to 0.0 and 0.8 mag in outburst . in previous outbursts ,",
    "however , the optical colors have become even bluer , being , for example , [ @xmath27=@xmath80.84 and [ @xmath27=@xmath80.94 in 1983 and in 1989 ( parsamian et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the present outburst is one of the least energetic among those observed in v1118 ori .",
    "indeed , the visual magnitudes registered at the peak of previous outburst have been : @xmath25=13.8 ( 1983 , marsden 1984 ) ; @xmath25=12.8 ( 1988 , gasparian & ohanian 1989 ) ; @xmath25@xmath2914.7 ( 1992 - 1994 , garca garca et al .",
    "1995 ) ; @xmath25=13.5 ( 1997 , hayakawa et al .",
    "1998 ) ; @xmath3012.8 ( 2005 , audard et al . 2010 ) .",
    "considering however that both the rising and declining times observed in the 1998 and 2005 outbursts have lasted @xmath2 100@xmath8300 days ( garca garca & parsamian 2000 , audard et al .",
    "2010 ) , it may be that the maximum level of activity was reached between january and september 2015 ( when no observations are available ) , or that the outburst is still in the rising phase .",
    "very recent observations by audard et al .",
    "( 2016 ) indicate that no significant photometric variations in both optical and near - infrared bands have occurred until mid - january 2016 .",
    "the analysis of the optical / near - ir outburst spectrum was essentially done in comparison with the quiescence spectrum discussed in paper i ( shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this was obtained with a similar instrumental setup as far as spectral resolution and sensitivity level are concerned .",
    "notably , these are one of the few examples of quiescence and outburst spectra of the same source taken with the same high - level instrumentation .",
    "a remarkable number of differences are evidenced by the comparison of the two spectra .",
    "( 1 ) a much increased number of emission lines is recognizable in the outburst spectrum , mainly of neutral and ionized metals ( , , , , ) .",
    "main lines are listed in table[tab : tab2 ] and their fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) are compared with those measured in the quiescence spectrum ( columns 5 and 6 )",
    ". the outburst - to - quiescence flux ratio of the balmer lines decreases from @xmath2 30 to @xmath2 8 going from @xmath31=15 to @xmath31=3 and that of the paschen series from @xmath2 30 to @xmath2 12 going from @xmath31=12 to @xmath31=7 . although a detailed modeling of the hydrogen line ratios is far from the aims of this paper , a qualitative comparison with models of paschen ( edwards et al .",
    "2013 ) and balmer ( antoniucci et al .",
    "2016 ) decrement series suggests that the observed behavior may be explained by a 0.5@xmath80.6 dex increase of the electron density , with no evident dependence on temperature variations .",
    "the ratio of the outburst - to - quiescence ew of the balmer series lines does not depend on n@xmath32 and is less than unity , suggesting that the line flux increase tightly follows that of the continuum .",
    "conversely , the ew ratios of the paschen lines are between 2 and 6 , indicating that the increase of the continuum level is smaller ( and therefore slower ) in the infrared than in the optical .",
    "the lines show the largest variations , with @xmath33/@xmath34 @xmath2 85 and @xmath35/@xmath36 15 .",
    "( 2 ) forbidden lines of [ ] and [ ] , which remained un - detected ( or barely detected ) in the quiescence spectrum are present in the outburst optical spectrum , suggesting that an enhancement of the mass ejection activity might have been triggered by the increase of the mass accretion rate . ( 3 ) a weak balmer jump ( bj ) , which is considered a direct indicator of accretion ( e.g. manara et al . 2016 and",
    "references therein ) is spotted at the end of the balmer series .",
    "we measured the bj by taking the ratio of the flux at 360 nm to that at 400 nm .",
    "we obtained a value of 0.9 , more than double the quiescence value . also , this exceeds the limit of 0.5 empirically put by herczeg & hillenbrand ( 2008 ) to identify mid - m dwarfs accretors .",
    "( 4 ) in the near - ir part of the spectrum , and in emission , as well as co overtone emission ( @xmath37=2 - 0 and @xmath37=3 - 1 ) , are clearly detected , while they were not present in the quiescence spectrum .",
    "( 5 ) despite the moderate spectral resolution , we are able to detect differences in the spectral profile of the brightest lines . as an example we show in figure[fig : fig2 ] the h@xmath38 spectral profile . in the quiescence spectrum ,",
    "the line is unresolved , and the emission peak is close to the rest velocity . during outburst , the line peak is blue - shifted by @xmath39 @xmath870 km s@xmath6 ( with respect to the local standard of rest ) , with a fwhm @xmath2 320 km s@xmath6 , indicating the appearance of a fast wind in this phase .",
    "a similar behavior was exhibited by the h@xmath38 profile during the 2005 outburst and subsequent decay ( herbig 2008 ) .",
    "+      the 2005 outburst was spectroscopically investigated in the optical and in the near - ir by herbig ( 2008 ) and lorenzetti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , respectively .",
    "the optical spectrum was taken by herbig during the declining phase ( 2005 november ) , when the star was somewhat brighter ( @xmath25 = 14.5 ) than at the epoch of our observation .",
    "since the ews of the most prominent lines ( , , and , see herbig s 2008 table 3 ) were slightly lower than the present ones , we qualitatively deduce that the line fluxes are rather similar in the two outbursts .",
    "herbig ( 2008 ) reports the unusual detection of lii@xmath406707 _ in emission _ , a line commonly seen in absorption in classical t tauri stars .",
    "we signal the presence of this line also in the mods spectrum , although detected at a low signal - to - noise level ( flux=1.5@xmath410.4 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath6 @xmath43 ) .",
    "+ the near - ir spectrum was taken in september 2005 ( @xmath44=11.2 , lorenzetti et al .",
    "2006 ) . the same emission features , with similar line fluxes as in the present case , were detected .",
    "in particular , since co emission is believed to originate in the gaseous inner disk where it traces relatively warm ( @xmath24000 k ) zones at high densities ( scoville et al .",
    "1980 ) , the constancy of the emitted flux could signal that the physical conditions of the environment around the accretion channels remains similar during all the events , and only the accretion rate varies .",
    "finally , in the same 2005 spectrum the h@xmath45 1 - 0s(1 ) was barely detected .",
    "this line appears at around 1.5@xmath46 level also in the luci2 spectrum .",
    "the line , together with the h@xmath45 2 - 1s(1 ) line , however , is definitely detected in the 2-d spectral image in a region extending from the source itself up to a distance of @xmath2 17 . the flux ratio between the two lines in such region is @xmath2 2 , suggesting a fluorescent excitation ( e.g. black & van dishoeck 1987 ) arising in the nebular environment where the source is located .",
    "an estimate of the mass accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) was obtained from fluxes of bright permitted lines .",
    "we employed the relationships between line flux and accretion luminosity ( @xmath47 ) given by alcal et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . for each line , the @xmath47 value",
    "was then converted into mass accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) by adopting the equation by gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . to have a meaningful comparison with the quiescence phase estimate ,",
    "we have employed the same lines as in paper i , namely lines of the balmer and paschen series along with and bright lines .",
    "we also adopted the same parameters as in paper i , namely : distance of 400 pc , @xmath48=0.4 m@xmath5 @xmath49=1.29 r@xmath5 ( hillenbrand 1997 ; stassun et al .",
    "1999 ) , and inner radius @xmath50=5 r@xmath5 .",
    "the result is depicted in figure[fig : fig3 ] , where we plot @xmath3 for each of the considered lines .",
    "the median of the @xmath3 values is 1.5 10@xmath4 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 and 4.2 10@xmath4 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 if the observed fluxes are de - reddened for a@xmath20=1 and 2 mag , respectively . with the same extinction values ,",
    "we get @xmath3=1@xmath83 10@xmath9 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 in the quiescence state ( paper i ) .    assuming that the nearly tenfold enhancement of the [ ] 6300 flux is due to an increase of the mass ejection activity , we derived mass ejection rates @xmath7= 0.8 10@xmath9m@xmath5yr@xmath6 and 2.0 10@xmath9m@xmath5yr@xmath6  for a@xmath20=1 and 2 mag , respectively , following the relationship given by hartigan et al .",
    "the same model gives 0.8 10@xmath51m@xmath5yr@xmath6 and 2.0 10@xmath51m@xmath5yr@xmath6 for the quiescence phase .",
    "it is of interest to compare the ratio @xmath3/@xmath7 in the two phases ; while this ratio is @xmath2 13 in quiescence , it increases to @xmath2 18 during the outburst .",
    "although the difference is slight , this indicates that the enhancement of the mass ejection rate proceeds slower than that of mass accretion rate .",
    "finally , to compare the mass accretion rate in two subsequent outbursts , we applied the procedure described above to the fluxes reported in lorenzetti et al .",
    "we get @xmath3(2005 ) @xmath2 10@xmath52 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 namely about a factor 5@xmath810 larger than the present value .",
    "however , such estimate is based only on near - ir line fluxes , which , as can been seen in figure[fig : fig3 ] , tend to give higher values than the optical lines . in this sense",
    ", the value of @xmath3(2005 ) has to be considered as an upper limit .",
    "alternatively , this might indicate that the present outburst is weaker than the previous one or that the observed brightness is not at its maximum level .",
    "we have detected a new outburst of the exor variable v1118 ori , and obtained the optical and near - ir low - resolution spectra . these have been analyzed in comparison to the quiescence ones , which were acquired with a very similar instrumental setup .",
    "the main results of our study are :    * we registered an increase of the continuum level .",
    "this increase goes from a factor @xmath2 40 in @xmath21 band down to factor @xmath2 4 @xmath53 band ; * the outburst spectrum is rich in emission lines , mainly from neutral and ionized metals . in particular , the fluxes of hi recombination lines have increased by about an order of magnitude ; * an increase of about an order of magnitude is estimated in the mass accretion rate . from bright optical and near - ir lines we estimate @xmath3= 1.2@xmath84.8 10@xmath4 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 . * a few forbidden lines from oi and sii are detected , likely indicating an enhancement of the mass ejection activity that is associated with the increase of the accretion rate . from the [ ] 6300 luminosity",
    "we estimate @xmath7= 0.8@xmath82 10@xmath9m@xmath5yr@xmath6 . *",
    "a comparison with light curves of previous outbursts suggests that the present outburst is relatively weak .",
