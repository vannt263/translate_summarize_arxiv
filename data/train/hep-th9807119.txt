    "the integration by part identities @xcite are by now a standard tool for obtaining relations between the many integrals associated to any feynman graph or , equivalently , for working out recurrence relations for expressing the generic integral in terms of the `` master integrals '' or  master amplitudes \" of the considered graph .",
    "a good example of the use of the integration by part identities is given in @xcite , where the recurrence relations for all the 2-loop self - mass amplitudes are established in the arbitrary masses case .",
    "+ it has been shown in @xcite that by that same technique one can obtain a set of linear first order differential equations for the master integrals themselves ; the coefficients of the equations are ratio of polynomials with integer coefficients in all the variables ; the equations are further non homogeneous , with the non homogeneous terms given by the master integrals of the simpler graphs obtained from the considered graph by removing one or more internal propagators .",
    "+ restricting ourselves for simplicity to the self - mass case , for any feynman graph the related integrals can in general be written in the form @xmath5 in more detail , @xmath6 stands for the @xmath7-continuous integration on an arbitrary number @xmath8 of loops and @xmath9 stands for the set of the corresponding loop momenta , so that there are altogether @xmath10 different scalar products , including @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the product of any power of the scalar products in the numerators divided by any power of the propagators occurring in the graph ( all masses will always be taken as different , unless otherwise stated ) ; as the propagators are also simple combinations of the scalar products , simplifications might occur between numerator and denominator and as a consequence one expects quite in general @xmath13 different factors altogether in the numerator and denominator , independently of the actual number of propagators present in the graph ( graphs with less propagators have more factors in the numerator and _ viceversa _ ) ; therefore the symbol @xmath14 in eq.([1 ] ) stands in fact for a set of @xmath13 indices  the ( integer ) powers of the @xmath13 factors .",

    "when the derivatives are explicitly carried out , one obtains the sum of a number of terms , all equal to a simple coefficient ( an integer number or , occasionally , @xmath7 ) , times an integrand of the form @xmath20 , with the set of indices @xmath21 differing at most by a unity in two places from the set @xmath14 . +",

    "+ let us consider now one of the master amplitudes themselves , say the master amplitude identified by the set of indices @xmath23 ; according to eq.([1 ] ) we can write @xmath26 by acting with @xmath27 on both sides we get @xmath28 according to the discussion following eq.([2 ] ) , the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ is a combination of integrands ; as eq.([3 ] ) applies to each of the corresponding integrals , one obtains the relations @xmath29 which are the required master equations . as in eq.([3 ] ) , @xmath24 refers to simpler master integrals ( in which one or more denominators are missing ; they constitute the non - homogeneous part of the master equations ) , to be considered as known when studying the @xmath30 .",
    "+ it is obvious from the derivation that the master equations can be established regardless of the number of loops .",
    "it is equally clear that for graphs depending on several external momenta ( such as vertex or 4-body scattering graphs ) one has simply to replace the single operator @xmath27 of eq.([5 ] ) by the set of operators @xmath31 , where @xmath32 run on all the external momenta , and with some more algebra one can obtain master equations in any desired mandelstam variable .",
    "+ the master equations are a powerful tool for the study and the evaluation of the master amplitudes ; among other things :    * they provide information on the values of the master amplitudes at special kinematical points ( such as @xmath33 in eq.([6 ] ) ; the _ l.h.s .",

    "_ is a relation among master amplitudes at @xmath33 , usually sufficient to fix their values at that point ) ; * the master equations are valid identically in @xmath7 , so that they can be expanded in @xmath34 and solved recursively for the various terms of the expansion in @xmath34 , starting from the most singular ( with 2-loop amplitudes one expects at most a double pole in @xmath34 ) ; * when the initial value at @xmath35 has been obtained , the equations can be integrated by means of fast and precise numerical methods ( for instance with a runge - kutta routine ) , so providing a convenient approach to their numerical evaluation ; note that the numerical approach can be used both for arbitrary @xmath7 or for @xmath36 , once the expansion has been properly carried out ; * the equations can be used to work out virtually any kind of expansion , in particular the large @xmath11 expansion , as will be shown in some detail ; * in particularly simple cases ( for instance when most of the masses vanish and only one or two scales are left ) the analytic quadrature of the equations can lead to the analytic evaluation of the master amplitudes .",
    "the use of the master equations for studying the 1-loop self - mass and the 2-loop sunrise self - mass graph has been already discussed , @xcite , @xcite ; we will describe here its application to the 2-loop 4-propagator self - mass graph shown in fig.1 .",
