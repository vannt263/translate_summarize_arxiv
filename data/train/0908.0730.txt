    "the development of high energy accelerators also leads to the development of technology to generate high electric and magnetic fields . in this note",
    "we want to explore how one can directly use these strong fields as laboratory for fundamental physics .",
    "high precision experiments in these strong fields allow us to search for new light particles which interact very weakly with the standard model particles . due to their extremely weak interaction these hidden sector particles",
    "may be missed in conventional collider experiments .",
    "accordingly the discussed high precision experiments provide complementary information on physics beyond the standard model .    in this note we will mainly discuss a particular type of hidden sector particle : minicharged particles .",
    "however , as we will see minicharged particles are often accompanied by an extra u(1 ) gauge boson , a hidden photon .",
    "minicharged particles interact with the ordinary electromagnetic field via the usual minimal coupling induced by the covariant derivative , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the electric charge of the particle @xmath2 .",
    "for example if @xmath2 is a fermion the interaction term reads @xmath3    the crucial point for a minicharged particle is now simply that the charge is much smaller than  @xmath4 , @xmath5 in particular it is not necessarily integer .",
    "indeed it does not even have to be a rational number .",
    "minicharges can arise in theories with kinetic mixing @xcite , or magnetic mixing  @xcite but also in scenarios with extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "typical predicted values , e.g. , in realistic string compactifications range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "before we investigate how minicharges can be experimentally searched for in strong field experiments let us briefly show how they arise in simple extensions of the standard model . as we will see , in this simple setup the minicharged particles are accompanied by an extra u(1 ) gauge boson which also opens up new possibilities for experimental searches .",
    "one way to have minicharged particles is in extensions of the standard model that contain an extra hidden u(1 ) gauge degree of freedom under which the standard model particles are uncharged .",
    "such a model has a gauge group u@xmath8 u@xmath9 .",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian in the gauge sector is , @xmath10 here , the @xmath11 is the field strength of the electromagnetic u(1)@xmath12 with the gauge field @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the field strength of the hidden u(1)@xmath15 with the gauge field @xmath16 .",
    "the gauge couplings are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the dual field strengths are defined as usual : @xmath19 and analogously for @xmath20 .",
    "the standard kinetic terms as well as the @xmath21- and @xmath22-terms are the diagonal entries in the lagrangian .",
    "kinetic  @xcite and magnetic mixing  @xcite between the different u(1 ) sectors is represented by the off - diagonal @xmath23-term and @xmath24-term , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that both the kinetic mixing and the magnetic mixing term naturally arise via quantum corrections when heavy particles are integrated out  @xcite even when both u(1)s arise from a single non - abelian gauge group  @xcite .",
    "let us now see how minicharges can arise in this setup by looking at two simple examples .",
    "+ * 1 . kinetic mixing : *",
    "consider a situation in which all the @xmath25-terms vanish but the kinetic mixing term @xmath26 .",
    "the kinetic terms in eq .   can be diagonalized by a shift of the hidden gauge field , @xmath27 apart from a multiplicative renormalization of the gauge coupling , @xmath28 the ordinary electromagnetic gauge field @xmath13 remains unaffected by this shift .",
    "consider now , for example , a hidden fermion @xmath2 charged under @xmath16 . applying the shift   to the coupling term",
    ", we find : @xmath29 since the kinetic term is now diagonal , it is clear that the particle @xmath2 ( which was originally charged only under u(1)@xmath15 ) interacts with the u(1)@xmath12 gauge field and appears to have a charge @xmath30 .    *",
    "magnetic mixing : * let us now look at the effect of the @xmath25-terms",
    ". for simplicity let us take @xmath31 , but @xmath32 .",
    "let us assume we have a magnetic monopole under the hidden gauge group . in a static situation with such a hidden monopole as a background the electric and magnetic fields of u(1)@xmath12 and u(1)@xmath15 read @xmath33 the magnetic mixing part of the lagrangian then reads @xmath34 where we have used the quantization condition @xmath35 in the last step ( see next section ) .",
    "the last part is , however , exactly what we would expect for the interaction of a particle with an ( ordinary ) _ electric _ charge @xmath36 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that minicharges can arise quite naturally in extensions of the standard model with an extra u(1 ) gauge factor .",
    "however , one might wonder how this fits with the idea of charge quantization ( for more details see @xcite ) .    in the following we will see that the extra u(1 ) gauge boson plays an important role in the compatibility of minicharges and charge quantization arguments . in the main text we will focus on a variant of the charge quantization arguments based on angular momentum quantization  @xcite in the presence of monopoles .",
    "in the appendix  [ alternative ] we look at the original dirac argument  @xcite and an argument based on the absence of black hole remnants ( and which does nt require magnetic monopoles ) .",
    "let us consider a configuration of a magnetic monopole with coupling @xmath37 and an electric charge @xmath38 with coupling strength @xmath39 .",
    "the field angular momentum of such a configuration is @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the unit vector pointing from the electric charge to the magnetic charge , and the right hand side can be obtained by inserting the electric fields @xmath42 and the magnetic field @xmath43 for the electric and magnetic monopole , respectively .",
    "the quantization of angular momentum in quantum mechanics now requires @xmath44 ) . enforcing eq .   for our minicharged particle as well as an electron",
    "now requires that the ratio between the charges is rational , i.e. @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "this forbids irrational minicharges such as say @xmath47 .",
    "however , in the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary real numbers .",
    "how can this be reconciled ?",
    "the answer lies in the extra u(1 ) .",
    "so far we have considered only the ordinary electromagnetic field . however",
    ", if the minicharge arises as in the previous section via kinetic mixing there is an additional u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "this field can now , too , contribute to the angular momentum .",
    "after the shift   the kinetic terms are diagonal and the generalized expression for the angular momentum is straightforward : @xmath48    with two u(1 ) factors we can , of course , also have more general magnetic monopoles . in general a monopole can have charges @xmath49 under the visible and hidden magnetic fields .",
    "its magnetic field will then be , @xmath50 we can now study static configurations of this monopole with :    * an ordinary electrically charged particle ( charge @xmath51 ) with a field @xmath52 and * a hidden sector particle ( hidden charge @xmath53 ) that has acquired a charge @xmath54 under the ordinary electromagnetic field , @xmath55    inserting into eq .",
    "we find @xmath56 angular momentum quantization now requires that both configurations have half - integer angular momentum , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are integers .",
    "it is clear that a naive monopole with @xmath60 causes a problem because this would require @xmath61 and therefore @xmath54 to be rational . in the previous section",
    "we have , however , seen that @xmath54 arises directly from a parameter of the low energy lagrangian and therefore it is typically not rational .",
    "this is the apparent contradiction produced by introducing both monopoles and minicharged particles .",
    "a closer inspection of eq .   reveals two types of monopoles which will not cause any such problems for arbitrary @xmath23 , @xmath62 for the first monopole @xmath63 and for the second @xmath64 .    in a pure u(1 ) setup we can simply choose the appropriate monopoles for consistency .",
    "if the u(1 ) arise from non - abelien gauge groups monopoles are unavoidable .",
    "when the symmetry is broken down to u(1)s they automatically arise as t hooft - polyakov monopoles  @xcite . however , as it turns out  @xcite these t hooft - polyakov monopoles have exactly the appropriate charges for consistency .",
    "so far we have seen that minicharges can arise naturally in extensions of the standard model .",
    "however , we have also seen that the way they are generated as well as their consistency with charge quantization suggests that they are accompanied by a ( massless ) u(1 ) gauge boson .",
    "this is not only of theoretical interest but will lead to interesting experimental tests . in the following three sections we will present tests for charge quantization that do not rely on the extra u(1 ) gauge boson before we make use of this feature in sect .  [ sec : lsw ] . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : polarization ] we look at an experiment which is actually better suited to constrain minicharged particles _ without _ hidden photons , showing that one can experimentally distinguish between a situation with / without a hidden photon .",
    "let us now turn to experimental searches for minicharged particles that employ ( strong ) electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the first experiment is directly sensitive to minicharged particles and does not rely on the existence of an extra hidden photon .",
    "the basic setup for the experiment  @xcite is depicted in fig .",
    "[ acdc ] . in a strong electric field",
    "a vacuum pair of charged particles gains energy if the particles are separated by a distance along the lines of the electric field .",
    "if the electric field is strong enough ( or the distance large enough ) the energy gain can overcome the rest mass , i.e. the virtual particles turn into real particles .",
    "this is the famous schwinger pair production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "after their production the electric field accelerates the particles and antiparticles according to their charge in opposite directions .",
    "this leads to an electric current ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ acdc ] ) . if the current is made up of minicharged particles the individual particles have very small charges and interact only very weakly with ordinary matter .",
    "therefore , they can pass even through thick walls nearly unhindered .",
    "an electron current , however , would be stopped .",
    "after passage through the wall we can then place an ampere meter to detect the minicharged particle current .",
    "typical accelerator cavities achieve field strengths of @xmath65 and their size is typically of the order of 10s of cm .",
    "precision ampere meters can certainly measure currents as small as @xmath66 and even smaller currents of the order of @xmath67 seem feasible . using the schwinger pair production rate we",
    "can then estimate the expected sensitivity for such an experiment to be @xmath68 therefore such an experiment has the potential for significant improvement over the currently best laboratory bounds shown in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] .",
    "and applies for a pure minicharged particle scenario .",
    "the shaded areas are excluded in both scenarios . ]    indeed , even without performing a dedicated experiment one can already obtain strong bounds from existing bounds on the energy loss in accelerator cavities  @xcite .",
    "the fact that high @xmath69 values have been achieved at large field values strongly limits the energy loss into unknown sources such as minicharged particle production .",
    "the corresponding bound is shown as the blue region in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] .",
    "minicharged particles would also leave detectable footprints on the distance dependence of the electrostatic potential  @xcite . in presence of charged particles coulomb s law is modified due to the effects of the vacuum polarization @xmath70 .",
    "this is the so - called uehling potential  @xcite ( for a textbook derivation see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath71    for large distances , @xmath72 , @xmath73 drops off exponentially whereas for small distances , @xmath74 , it s behavior is logarithmic as expected from the running gauge coupling , @xmath75 \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad{\\rm for}\\quad\\quad mr\\gg 1 , \\\\\\nonumber \\!\\!&\\approx&\\!\\ !",

    "in contrast light minicharged particles could lead to modifications of coulomb s law at relatively large distances .",
    "we can therefore probe minicharged particles by testing coulomb s law .",
    "one way to test coulomb s law is to use a so called cavendish type experiment . here , the electric potential between an outer charged conducting sphere and an uncharged inner sphere is measured .",
    "a specific feature of coulomb s law is that the electric potential inside a charged conductor is constant .",
    "therefore , a non - vanishing voltage between the inner uncharged sphere and the outer sphere would indicate a deviation of coulomb s law .    by applying high voltages to the outer sphere and looking for minuscle voltages between the inner and the outer sphere experiments of this type",
    "have been performed with enormous precisions of up to about 2 parts in @xmath76 for sphere sizes of 10s of centimeters  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the black bound shown in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] .",
    "minicharged particles could also be searched for using a new type of tunneling process , `` tunneling of the 3rd kind ''  @xcite .",
    "this process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ t3k ] . here ,",
    "photons split into a _",
    "virtual _ particle  antiparticle pair of charged particles which traverse an opaque wall and recombine after the wall into a photon . due to their tiny interactions with ordinary matter",
    "the ( virtual ) minicharged particles can simply pass through the wall whereas photons would be stopped .",
    "after recombination the photons can then be detected . in this way",
    "minicharged particles lead to a light - shining - through - a - wall ( lsw ) signature .",
    "in contrast to the classical lsw process  @xcite ( fig .  [ classical ] ) where the photon is converted into a single _ real _ particle the intermediate particles are _",
    "virtual_. accordingly , this process depends on the thickness of the wall .    to observe this process",
    "we would like to use a relatively thin wall that is nevertheless completely intransparent to the photons themselves .",
    "for optical frequencies this is rather difficult ( among other things due to the high energy of the photons ) .",
    "therefore , here we will consider an experiment using static magnetic fields shielded by a superconductor .",
    "the basic idea @xcite of the proposed experiment is very similar to a classic lsw experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , instead of light it uses a static magnetic field and the wall is replaced by superconducting shielding ( cf .",
    "[ magnet ] ) . outside the shielding",
    "we have a strong magnetic field . upon entering the superconductor the ordinary electromagnetic field",
    "is exponentially damped with a length scale given by the london penetration depth @xmath77 . yet",
    ", due to tunneling of the 3rd kind a small fraction of the magnetic field penetrates the wall and can be detected by a magnetometer .",
    "since the magnetometer measures directly the field ( and not some probability or power output ) the signal is proportional to the transition amplitude and therefore to the charge squared , @xmath78 , instead of being proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "high precision magnetometers can measure fields of the order of @xmath80  t and even tiny fields of a few  @xmath81  t seem feasible .",
    "the expected sensitivity is of the order of @xmath82 .    ]",
    "in the previous section we have already encountered the possibility that minicharged particles can lead to a light - shining - through - a - wall signature .",
    "if there is also a light hidden u(1 ) gauge boson an additional process is possible and typically dominant : classical lsw via the hidden photon .",
    "the essential process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ convertbb ] . in presence of a non - vanishing magnetic background field",
    "the ordinary electromagnetic photon can be converted into a hidden photon via a minicharged particle loop  @xcite .",
    "the hidden photon can then traverse the wall and be reconverted on the opposite side of the wall via the inverse process . in terms of fig .",
    "[ classical ] the minicharged particle - loop is the ( resolved ) black dot and the hidden photon the dashed particle line .",
    "currently a sizable number of lsw experiments  @xcite are under way  @xcite .",
    "they employ strong lasers as light sources and recycled magnets from accelerator experiments to provide for the magnetic field .",
    "their power lies in the fact that they can put in @xmath83 photons per second and are often able to detect @xmath84 photon per second .",
    "the bounds arising from lsw experiments are shown as the red - black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] .",
    "let us note again , that this bound on minicharged particles relies on the presence of an extra hidden u(1 ) gauge boson .",
    "but , as we have seen in the first few sections , this is quite natural .",
    "finally , let us turn to laser polarization experiments  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "polarized laser light in shone through a strong magnetic field and changes in the polarization are searched for .",
    "these measurements can be used as sensitive probes of minicharged particles  @xcite .",
    "we can have two different types of changes in the polarization : a rotation of the linear polarization and a change into an elliptical polarization .",
    "in particular the rotation is ( nearly ) free of standard model backgrounds and therefore very suitable to probe for new physics  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ polarization ] a selective absorption of one polarization direction via minicharged particle production results in a rotation of the linear polarization .",
    "a phase shift due to the vacuum polarziation leads to an ellipticity of the polarization .    if there are only minicharged particles fig .",
    "[ polarization ] describes the whole story . for this case",
    "we obtain the red - dashed bound in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] .    in presence of an additional hidden photon",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "indeed one has to solve the full equations of motion arising from the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ lsw ]  @xcite . as it turns out in this case the bounds are typically weaker than those obtained with other methods described above .",
    "this can serve as an example that the extra hidden photon can also `` hide '' some of the experimental signatures of minicharged particles . more positively",
    ", this also explicitly shows that we can experimentally distinguish between the two situations .",
    "minicharged particles are a natural candidate for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "their embedding into extensions of the standard model as well as charge quantization tests suggest that they are accompanied by an extra u(1 ) gauge boson , the hidden photon .",
    "light minicharged particles can be searched for in a large variety of laboratory experiments using high precision measurements in strong electric and magnetic fields . using different experiments it is possible to distinguish between a situation which only has minicharged particles and one where the minicharged particle is accompanied by a hidden photon .",
    "it should be mentioned that for minicharged particles astrophysical bounds  @xcite are often considerably stronger than the current laboratory bounds",
    ". however , astrophysical bounds are also somewhat more model dependent  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent rapid progress in the laboratory experiments raises the hope for considerable improvements in the near future .    finally , the minicharged particles discussed in this note are only one example of a more general class of weakly interacting sub - ev particles ( wisps ) that can be searched for in small scale laboratory experiments at low energies .",
    "most of the above described experiments are also sensitive to other species of wisps .",
    "for example , the extra hidden u(1 ) photon could also be massive .",
    "this leads to interesting effects such as photon ",
    "hidden photon oscillations even in absence of extra hidden matter that would become minicharged . for massive hidden photons experiments of the above described types provide the best bounds  even stronger than astrophysical bounds  for a large range of parameters .    with their small scale and rapid development low energy but high precision experiments inside strong elctromagnetic fields provide an interesting probe of physics beyond the standard model",
    "they are not only complementary in the type of physics they probe but in addition they often recycle parts developed for accelerators such as high field magnets or high quality cavities .",
    "the author wishes to thank the organizers of the workshop _",
    "advanced qed methods for future accelerators _ for a stimulating meeting .",
    "moreover he is indebted to s.  abel , m.  ahlers , f.  bruemmer , h.  gies , v.  v.  khoze , j.  redondo and a.  ringwald for many many interesting discussions and fruitful collaboration on the subjects discussed in these proceedings .",
    "in this appendix we will briefly consider alternative arguments for charge quantization and investigate how they are compatible with kinetic mixing .      in the main text",
    "we have used angular momentum quantization to argue in favor of charge quantization .",
    "alternatively we can follow more closely dirac s original strategy  @xcite and look at gauge transformations .",
    "let us take a look at the gauge field configuration of a dirac monopole .",
    "the gauge field for a dirac monopole with its string pointing in the @xmath85 direction is , @xmath86 where the hat denotes unit vectors .",
    "a dirac monopole with its string pointing in the north pole direction @xmath87 is physically equivalent to one with the string pointing in the south pole direction @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , they must be related by a gauge transformation , @xmath89 under this gauge transformation the wave function of a particle with charge @xmath38 changes according to , @xmath90 since the wave function must be a proper continuous function @xmath91 must be single valued .",
    "now let us calculate @xmath92 for our gauge transformation given by eq .  .",
    "moving the particle from @xmath93 to @xmath94 the gauge phase changes by , @xmath95 now we can also imagine moving the particle around a closed loop .",
    "the single valuedness of the gauge transformation @xmath96 then requires @xmath97 for any closed curve .    for our gauge transformation changing the direction of the string from the north to the south pole the right hand side of eq .",
    "can be easily evaluated for a closed curve around the equator and we obtain the charge quantization condition , @xmath98    in the case of minicharges with kinetic mixing we can now ask ourselves how this quantization condition is fulfilled . as with the angular momentum argument the trick is to take into account the effect of the hidden magnetic monopole field . for the ordinary electron which has no hidden electric charge the argument works as above . however , for the minicharged particle arising from kinetic mixing eq .",
    "picks up an additional contribution from the hidden monopole field , @xmath99 this is exactly equivalent to eq .   and is automatically fulfilled if @xmath100 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that we have only two types of particles with charge @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "without restriction we can assume @xmath104 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that they have the same mass @xmath58 .",
    "because the charge ratio is irrational we can make arbitrarily small total charges by combining a number @xmath105 or particles ( and antiparticles ) @xmath106 for each @xmath107 we can now find a combination such that @xmath108 is minimal and @xmath109 .",
    "neglecting the ( small ) interaction energy the energy of such a configuration is @xmath110 .",
    "however , on the other hand @xmath111 depends on @xmath112 and goes to infinity as @xmath113 . therefore we can construct a series @xmath114 such that @xmath115 the last statement means that with increasing @xmath116 the energy of such configurations increases without bound .",
    "now , let us take such a configuration of charge @xmath117 and throw it into an uncharged black hole .",
    "now this black hole can decay by emitting hawking radiation of uncharged particles , e.g. photons , until it has reached an extremal reissner - nordstrom state such that @xmath118 . ] with @xmath119 and can not decay any further without loosing charge .",
    "however , for sufficiently large @xmath116 ( cf .",
    "@xmath120 and the black hole also can not shed charge by emitting charged particles because of energy conservation would only increase the total charge of the black hole and is therefore forbidden . ] .",
    "in other words the created black hole is stable .",
    "indeed we have an infinite number of such remnant states in the theory .",
    "this is in violation of our assumption that the theory is remnant free .",
    "again we can ask ourselves if minicharges arising from kinetic mixing can circumvent this charge quantization argument .",
    "indeed they can .",
    "the reason is again that the electrically minicharged particles also have a hidden electric charge .",
    "a combination of particles with a smaller and smaller visible electric charge then must have higher and higher hidden charges .",
    "this modifies the condition for the charged black hole , @xmath121 due to the high hidden charge the black hole now typically has enough energy / mass to decay directly into charged particles and thereby shed its charge , allowing for a complete decay .",
