    "the discovery of at least five new @xmath1-ray pulsars by the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) and rosat has re - ignited theoretical work on the physical processes and modeling of high - energy radiation from pulsars . including the previously known @xmath1-ray pulsars , crab ( nolan et al . 1993 ) and vela ( kanbach et al .",

    "for the first time , it is possible to look for the similarities and patterns in the @xmath1-ray emission characteristics that may reveal clues to the origin of this emission .",
    "examples are a preponderance of double pulses , a @xmath1-ray luminosity vs. polar cap current correlation , a spectral hardness vs. characteristic age correlation , and spectral cutoffs above a few gev ( e.g. thompson 1996 ) . psr1509 - 58 stands out among the known @xmath1-ray pulsars as having both an unusually low spectral cutoff energy ( somewhere between 2 and 30 mev ) and the highest inferred surface magnetic field ( @xmath7 gauss ) .",
    "it has been detected by the cgro instruments operating only in the lowest energy bands , batse ( wilson et al .",
    "1993 ) and osse ( matz et al . 1994 ) , with the higher energy instruments , comptel ( bennett et al . 1993 ) and egret ( nel et al . 1996 ) , giving upper limits that require a cutoff or turnover between 2 and 30 mev .",
    "there is no evidence for pulsed tev emission ( nel et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "there are currently two types of models for @xmath1-ray pulsars being investigated in detail .",
    "polar cap models assume that particles are accelerated along open field lines near the neutron star by strong parallel electric fields ( e.g. arons 1983 ) .",
    "the primary particles induce electromagnetic cascades through the creation of electron - positron pairs by either curvature radiation ( daugherty & harding 1982 , 1994 , 1996 ) or inverse - compton radiation ( sturner & dermer 1994 ) @xmath1-rays .",
    "outer gap models assume that the primary particles are accelerated along open field lines in the outer magnetosphere , near the null charge surface , where the corotation charge changes sign , and where strong electric fields may develop ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ; chiang & romani 1992 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ) .",
    "since the magnetic fields in the outer gaps are too low to sustain one - photon pair production cascades , these models must rely on photon - photon pair production of @xmath1-rays , interacting with either non - thermal x - rays from the gap or thermal x - rays from the neutron star surface , to initiate pair cascades .",
    "magnetic one - photon pair production , @xmath8 , has so far been the only photon attenuation mechanism assumed to operate in polar cap cascade models .",
    "another attenuation mechanism , photon splitting , will also operate in the high - field regions near pulsar polar caps but has not yet been included in polar cap model calculations .",
    "the rate of photon splitting increases rapidly with increasing field strength ( adler 1971 ) , so that it may even be the dominant attenuation process in the highest field pulsars .",
    "there are several potentially important consequences of photon splitting for @xmath1-ray pulsar models .",
    "since photon splitting has no threshold , it can attenuate photons below the threshold for pair production , @xmath9 , and can thus produce cutoffs in the spectrum at lower energies . here",
    "@xmath10 is the angle between the photon momentum and the magnetic field vectors , and @xmath11 is ( hereafter ) expressed in units of @xmath12 . when the splitting rate becomes large enough , splitting can take place during a photon s propagation through the neutron star magnetosphere _",
    "before the pair production threshold is crossed ( i.e. before an angle to the field is achieved ) .",
    "consequently , the production of secondary electrons and positrons in pair cascades will be suppressed .",
    "instead of _ pair _ cascades , one could have _ splitting _ cascades , where the high - energy photons split repeatedly until they escape the magnetosphere .",
    "the potential importance of photon splitting in neutron star applications was suggested by adler ( 1971 ) , mitrofanov _ et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and baring ( 1988 ) .",
    "its attenuation and reprocessing properties have been explored in the contexts of annihilation line suppression in gamma - ray pulsars ( baring 1993 ) , and spectral formation of gamma - ray bursts from neutron stars ( baring 1991 ) .",
    "photon splitting cascades have also been investigated in models of soft @xmath1-ray repeaters , where they will soften the photon spectrum very efficiently with no production of pairs ( baring 1995 , baring & harding 1995a , harding & baring 1996 , chang et al .",
    "_ _    in this paper we examine the importance of photon splitting in @xmath1-ray pulsar polar cap models ( it presumably will not operate in the low fields of outer gap models ) .",
    "following a brief discussion of the physics of photon splitting in section  2 , we present calculations of the splitting attenuation lengths and escape energies in the dipole magnetic field of a neutron star . a preliminary study",
    "( harding , baring & gonthier 1996 ) has shown that splitting will be the primary mode of attenuation of @xmath1-rays emitted parallel to a magnetic field gauss .",
    "we then present , in section  3 , photon splitting cascade models for two cases : ( 1 ) when only one mode of splitting ( @xmath13 ) allowed by the kinematic selection rules ( adler 1971 , shabad 1975 ) operates , suppressing splitting of photons of parallel polarization ( so that they can only pair produce ) , but still permitting photons of perpendicular polarization to either split once or produce pairs , and ( 2 ) when the three splitting modes allowed by cp ( charge - parity ) invariance operate , producing mode switching and a predominantly photon splitting cascade . in section  4 , model cascade spectra are compared to the observed spectrum of psr1509 - 58 to determine the range of magnetic colatitude emission points ( if any ) that can produce a spectral cutoff consistent with the data .",
    "these spectra have cutoff energies that are decreasing functions of the magnetic colatitude .",
    "it is found that a reasonably broad range of polar cap sizes will accommodate the data , and that strong polarization signatures appear in the spectra due to the action of photon splitting .",
    "the basic features of magnetic photon splitting and the more familiar process of single - photon pair creation are outlined in the next two subsections before investigating their role as photon attenuation mechanisms in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "note that throughout this paper , energies will be rendered dimensionless , for simplicity , using the scaling factor .",
    "magnetic fields will also often be scaled by the critical field ; this quantity will be denoted by a prime : .",
    "the splitting of photons in two in the presence of a strong magnetic field is an exotic and comparatively recent prediction of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , with the first correct calculations of the reaction rate being performed in the early 70s ( bialynicka - birula and bialynicki - birula 1970 ; adler _ et al . 1970 ; adler 1971 ) .",
    "its relative obscurity to date ( compared , for example , with magnetic pair creation ) in the astrophysical community stems partly from the mathematical complexity inherent in the computation of the rate .",
    "splitting is a third - order qed process with a triangular feynman diagram .",
    "hence , though splitting is kinematically possible , when it is forbidden by a charge conjugation symmetry of qed known as furry s theorem ( e.g. see jauch and rohrlich , 1980 ) , which states that ring diagrams that have an odd number of vertices with only external photon lines generate interaction matrix elements that are identically zero .",
    "this symmetry is broken by the presence of an external field .",
    "the splitting of photons is therefore a purely quantum effect , and has appreciable reaction rates only when the magnetic field is at least a significant fraction of the quantum critical field gauss .",
    "splitting into more than two photons is prohibited in the limit of zero dispersion because of the lack of available quantum phase space ( minguzzi 1961 ) . _    the reaction rate for splitting is immensely complicated by dispersive effects ( e.g. adler 1971 ; stoneham 1979 ) caused by the deviation of the refractive index from unity in the strong field . consequently , manageable expressions for the rate of splitting are only possible in the limit of zero dispersion , and are still then complicated triple integrations ( see stoneham 1979 , and also baer , milshten , and shasultanov 1986 for electric field splitting ) due to the presence of magnetic electron propagators in the matrix element . hence simple expressions for the rate of splitting of a photon of energy in a field were first obtained by bialynicka - birula and bialynicki - birula ( 1970 ) , adler _",
    "et al . ( 1970 ) and adler ( 1971 ) in the low - energy , non - dispersive limit : .",
    "the total rate in this limit , averaged over photon polarizations ( papanyan and ritus , 1972 ) , is expressible in terms of an attenuation coefficient @xmath14 where is the fine structure constant , is the compton wavelength of the electron , and is the angle between the photon momentum and the magnetic field vectors . here is a strong - field modification factor ( derivable , for example , from eq .",
    "41 of stoneham , 1979 : see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : splitratecorr ] ] below ) that approximates unity when and scales as for .",

    "the produced photons emerge at an angle to the field since splitting is a collinear process in the low - dispersion limit .",
    "adler ( 1971 ) observed that in the low - energy limit , the splitting rate was strongly dependent on the polarization states of the initial and final photons ; this feature prompted the suggestion by adler et al .",
    "( 1970 ) and usov and shabad ( 1983 ) that photon splitting should be a powerful polarizing mechanism in pulsars .",
    "the polarization - dependent rates can be taken from eq .",
    "( 23 ) of adler ( 1971 ) , which can be related to equations  ( [ eq : splitotrate ] ) or  ( [ eq : splitdiffrate ] ) via @xmath16 where the scattering amplitude coefficients @xmath17 are given in adler ( 1971 ) and eq .  41 of stoneham ( 1979 ) . in the limit of , and , while in the limit of , equation  ( [ eq : splitcoeff ] ) produces and .",
    "the factor of two in the numerator of the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : splitpolrate ] ) accounts for the duplicity of photons produced in splitting .",
    "the photon polarization labelling convention of stoneham ( 1979 ) is adopted here ( this standard form was not used by adler , 1971 ) : the label refers to the state with the photon s _ electric field vector parallel to the plane containing the magnetic field and the photon s momentum vector , while denotes the photon s electric field vector being normal to this plane .",
    "summing over the polarization modes yields the relationship for the strong - field modification factor in equation  ( [ eq : splitotrate ] ) : @xmath18 note that , in the absence of vacuum dispersion , the splitting modes , and are forbidden by arguments of cp ( charge - parity ) invariance in qed ( adler 1971 ) ; dispersive effects admit the possibility of non - collinear photon splitting so that there is a small but non - zero probability for the channel . equations  ( [ eq : splitotrate])([eq : splitratecorr ] ) define the rates to be used in the analyses of this paper , and are valid for .",
    "the triple integral expressions that stoneham ( 1979 ) derives are valid ( below pair creation threshold ) for a complete range ( i.e. 0 to ) of the expansion parameter , but are not presently in a computational form suitable for use here .",
    "work is in progress to address this deficiency ( baring & harding 1996 ) , and preliminary results indicate that equations  ( [ eq : splitotrate])([eq : splitratecorr ] ) approximate stoneham s ( 1979 ) formulae to better than two percent for , and differs by at most a factor of around 2.5 for , the value relevant to the calculations of this paper ; the splitting rate given by stoneham s formulae initially increase above the low energy limits as increases .",
    "_    recently there has appeared a new result on the rates of photon splitting .",
    "mentzel , berg & wunner ( 1994 ) presented an s - matrix calculation of the rates for the three polarization modes permitted by cp invariance that are considered here . while their formal development is comparable to an earlier s - matrix formulation of splitting in melrose & parle ( 1983a , b ) , their presentation of numerical results appeared to be in violent disagreement ( see also their astrophysical presentation in wunner , sang & berg 1995 ) with the splitting results obtained via the schwinger proper - time technique by adler ( 1971 ) and stoneham ( 1979 ) that comprise equations  ( [ eq : splitotrate])([eq : splitratecorr ] ) here .",
    "these results have now been retracted , the disagreement being due to a sign error in their numerical code ( wilke & wunner 1996 ) .",
    "the revised results are in much better agreement with the rates computed by adler ( 1971 ) . however , the revised numerical splitting rates of wilke & wunner ( 1996 ) still differ by as much as a factor of 3 from baring & harding s ( 1996 ) computations of stoneham s ( 1979 ) general formulae .",
    "baer , milshten , & shasultanov ( 1996 ) generate numerical results from their earlier alternative proper - time calculation ( baer , milshten , & shasultanov 1986 ) that are in accord with stoneham s and adler s ( 1971 ) results and also with those of baring & harding ( 1996 ) .",
    "the numerical computation of the s - matrix formalism is a formidable task .",
    "the proper - time analysis , though difficult , is more amenable , and has been reproduced in the limit of by numerous authors . as the s - matrix and proper - time techniques should produce equivalent results , and indeed have done so demonstrably in the case of pair production ( see dh83 and tsai & erber 1974 ) , we choose to use the amenable proper - time results outlined above in the calculations of this paper .",
    "the above results ignore the fact that the magnetized vacuum is dispersive and birefringent , so that the phase velocity of light is less than and depends on the photon polarization",
    ". dispersion can therefore alter the kinematics of qed processes such as splitting ( adler 1971 ) , and further dramatically complicates the formalism for the rates ( stoneham 1979 ) .",
    "extensive discussions of dispersion in a magnetized vacuum are presented by adler ( 1971 ) and shabad ( 1975 ) ; considerations of plasma dispersion are not relevant to the problem of gamma - ray emission from pulsars because they become significant only for densities in excess of around @xmath19 , which are only attained at the stellar surface .",
    "adler ( 1971 ) showed that in the limit of _ weak vacuum dispersion ( roughly delineated by @xmath20 ) , where the refractive indices for the polarization states are _ very _ close to unity , energy and momentum could be simultaneously conserved only for the splitting mode ( of the modes permitted by cp invariance ) below pair production threshold .",
    "this kinematic selection rule was demonstrated for subcritical fields , where the dispersion is very weak , a regime that generally applies to gamma - ray pulsar scenarios .",
    "therefore , it is probable that only the one mode ( ) of splitting operates in gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "this result may be modified by subtle effects such as those incurred by field non - uniformity .",
    "we adopt a dual scenario in this paper for the sake of completeness : one in which all cp - permitted modes of splitting operate , and one in which adler s kinematic selection rules are imposed .",
    "note that in magnetar models of soft gamma repeaters ( e.g baring 1995 , harding and baring 1996 ) , where supercritical fields are employed , moderate vacuum dispersion arises .",
    "in such a regime , it is not clear whether adler s selection rules still endure , since his analysis implicitly uses weak dispersion limits of linear vacuum polarization results ( e.g. see shabad 1975 ) , and omits higher order contributions ( e.g. see melrose and parle 1983a , b ) to the vacuum polarization ( for example , those that couple to photon absorption via splitting ) that become prominent in supercritical fields .",
    "furthermore , plasma dispersion effects may be quite pertinent to soft gamma repeater models ( e.g. bulik and miller 1996 ) , rendering them distinctly different from pulsar scenarios .",
    "_      one - photon pair production is a first - order qed process that is quite familiar to pulsar theorists .",
    "it is forbidden in field - free regions due to the imposition of four - momentum conservation , but takes place in an external magnetic field , which can absorb momentum perpendicular to * b. the rate ( toll 1952 , klepikov 1954 ) increases rapidly with increasing photon energy and transverse magnetic field strength , becoming significant for @xmath1-rays above the threshold , @xmath21 , and for fields approaching @xmath22 . when the photon energy is near threshold , there may be only a few kinematically available pair states , and the rate will be resonant at each pair state threshold , producing a sawtooth structure ( daugherty & harding 1983 , hereafter dh83 )",
    ". for photon energies well above threshold , the number of pair states becomes large , allowing the use of a more convenient asymptotic expression for the polarization dependent attenuation coefficient ( klepikov 1954 , tsai & erber 1974 ) : @xmath23 *    @xmath24    where @xmath25 .    in polar cap pulsar models ( e.g. sturrock 1971 , ruderman and sutherland 1975 )",
    ", high energy radiation is usually emitted at very small angles to the magnetic field , well below pair threshold ( see harding 1995 , for review ) .",
    "the @xmath1-ray photons will convert into pairs only after they have traveled a distance @xmath26 comparable to the field line radius of curvature @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 . from the above expression",
    ", the pair production rate will be vanishingly small until the argument of the exponential approaches unity , i.e. when @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , pair production will occur well above threshold when @xmath30 and the asymptotic expression will be valid .",
    "however when @xmath31 , pair production will occur at or near threshold , where the asymptotic expression has been shown to fall orders of magnitude below the exact rate ( dh83 ) . in the present calculation , we approximate the near - threshold reduction in the asymptotic pair production attenuation coefficient by making the substitution , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 in equation  ( [ eq : ppratlim ] ) ( dh83 ) . baring ( 1988 )",
    "has derived an analytic expression for the one - photon pair production rate near threshold which gives a result that agrees numerically with the approximation of dh83 .",
    "yet even the near - threshold correction to the asymptotic rate becomes poor when @xmath34 and the photons with parallel and perpendicular polarization produce pairs only ( dh83 ) in the ground ( 0,0 ) and first excited ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) states respectively .",
    "here denotes the landau level quantum numbers of the produced pairs .",
    "therefore when the local @xmath35 , instead of the asymptotic form in equation  ( [ eq : ppratlim ] ) , we use the exact , polarization - dependent , pair production attenuation coefficient ( dh83 ) , including only the ( 0,0 ) pair state for @xmath36 polarization : @xmath37 and only the sum of the ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) states for @xmath38 polarization : @xmath39 where @xmath40 for @xmath41^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath42 actually , both the asymptotic and exact mean - free paths ( @xmath43 ) are so small in fields where photons pair produce at threshold that it is , in fact , not important which rate is used at very high field strengths ( i.e. @xmath44 ) .",
    "the pair production rate in this regime thus behaves like a wall at threshold and photons will pair produce as soon as they satisfy the kinematic restrictions on given in equations  ( [ eq : tpppar ] ) and  ( [ eq : tppperp ] ) .",
    "the creation of bound pairs rather than free pairs is possible in fields @xmath45 ( usov & melrose 1995 ) , but this should not affect the present calculation since we do not model the full pair cascade .      to assess the relative importance of photon splitting compared to pair production through a dipole magnetic field",
    ", we compute the attenuation length , defined to be the path length over which the optical depth is unity : @xmath46 where is the pathlength differential along the photon momentum vector and @xmath47 is the attenuation coefficient for either splitting , @xmath48 , or pair production , @xmath49 . in this paper ,",
    "attenuation lengths are computed as averages over polarizations of the initial photon and , for splitting , sums over the final polarization states . here and the photon energy are functions of the position ( e.g. see equation  [ [ eq:4momgr ] ] ) , specifically measured in the local inertial frame , while is the colatitude of emission and is the photon energy to an observer at infinity ; our treatment of curved spacetime is discussed immediately below . in regions where the path length is much shorter than both the scale length of the field strength variation or the radius of curvature of the field , reduces to the inverse of the attenuation coefficient . in the calculation of the splitting attenuation lengths ,",
    "all three cp - permitted modes are assumed to operate .",
    "the attenuation length behavior of the individual modes are similar .",
    "we assume that test photons are emitted at the neutron star surface and propagate outward , initially parallel or at a specified angle , @xmath50 to the dipole magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] for a depiction of the geometry ) .",
    "photon emission in polar cap models of gamma - ray pulsars can occur above the stellar surface ( but see the discussion in section  5 ) , which would generate attenuation lengths somewhat longer than those determined here , due to the decay of the field .",
    "a surface origin of the photons is chosen in this paper to provide a simple and concise presentation of the attenuation properties .",
    "we have included the general relativistic effects of curved spacetime in a schwarzschild metric , following the treatment of gonthier & harding ( 1994 , gh94 ) who studied the effects of general relativity on photon attenuation via magnetic pair production .",
    "gh94 included the curved spacetime photon trajectories , the magnetic dipole field in a schwarzschild metric and the gravitational redshift of the photon energy .",
    "one improvement we have made here to the treatment of gh94 is to explicitly keep track of the gravitational redshift of the photon energy as a function of distance from the neutron star ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "our analysis is confined to the schwarzschild metric because the dynamical timescales for gamma - ray pulsars are considerably shorter than their period ( e.g. sec . for psr1509 - 58 ) , so that rotation effects in the kerr metric can be neglected .",
    "we have taken a neutron star mass , @xmath51 and radius , @xmath52 cm in these calculations .",

    "a field of @xmath53 is the value of the polar surface field derived from the magnetic dipole spin - down energy loss ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , using the measured @xmath54 and @xmath55 for psr1509 - 58 . as noted by usov & melrose ( 1995 ) ,",
    "this is exactly twice the value of the surface field given by formulae in other sources ( manchester & taylor 1977 , michel 1991 ) , which assume ( inaccurately ) that the dipole magnetic moment @xmath56 rather than @xmath57 for a uniformly magnetized sphere of radius @xmath58 .",
    "the other @xmath1-ray pulsars have surface field strengths in the range @xmath59 g , or @xmath60 ( the crab and vela pulsars have fields around @xmath61 ) .",
    "note that the attenuation lengths in fig .",
    "[ fig : attenl ] are for unpolarized radiation ; the curves for @xmath36 and @xmath38 polarization states look very similar .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : attenl ] have a power - law behavior at high energies , i.e. for attenuation lengths much less than @xmath62 cm , where the dipole field is almost uniform in direction and of roughly constant strength .",
    "they also exhibit sharp increases at the low energy end , where photons begin to escape the magnetosphere without attenuation .",
    "we may estimate the behavior of the power - law portions of the attenuation length curves in fig  [ fig : attenl ] as follows .",
    "since the photons are assumed to initially propagate parallel to the field , the field curvature will give propagation oblique to the field only after significant distances are traversed , so that the obliquity of the photon to the field scales , to first order , as the distance travelled , . inserting this in equation  ( [ eq : splitotrate ] )",
    "gives a photon splitting attenuation coefficient i.e. an optical depth , since .",
    "inversion then indicates that the attenuation length should vary as : this is borne out in fig .",
    "[ fig : attenl ] . for @xmath63",
    ", pair production occurs as soon as the threshold @xmath64 is crossed ( cf .",
    "section 2.2 ) during the photon propagation in the magnetosphere .",
    "essentially , due to the enormous creation rate immediately above the threshold , this energy serves as an impenetrable `` wall '' to the photon .",
    "again , since in the early stages of propagation , the pair production attenuation length should scale as .",
    "these proportionalities hold in both curved and flat spacetime since general relativistic effects distort spacetime in a smooth and differentiable manner ( see the appendix ) . however , the attenuation lengths computed in the schwarzschild metric are about a factor of 1.5 lower than those computed in flat spacetime ( baring & harding 1995b ) .",
    "the photon splitting attenuation coefficient we have used is strictly valid only below pair threshold .",
    "hence , the attenuation lengths for splitting depicted in fig .  [ fig : attenl ] can be regarded as only being symbolic when they exceed those for pair production , since then pair threshold is reached before splitting occurs . no technically amenable general expressions for the rate of splitting above pair threshold exist in the physics literature .",
    "but the vicinity of parameter space just below pair threshold is the regime of importance for @xmath1-ray pulsar models , where the emitted photons propagate until they either split or they reach pair threshold , in which case they pair produce .",

    "the energy at which the attenuation length becomes infinite defines the _ escape energy , below which the optical depth is always , and photons escape the magnetosphere ; the existence of such an escape energy is a consequence of the decay of the dipole field .",

    "this behaviour extends to higher surface fields because production then is at threshold , which determines . at high fields , @xmath4 ,",
    "there is a saturation of the photon splitting attenuation lengths and escape energies , due to the diminishing dependence of @xmath67 in the attenuation coefficient .",

    "the largest effects are due to the increase of the surface dipole field strength by roughly a factor of 1.4 , and the correction for the gravitational redshift of the photon , which increases the photon energy by roughly a factor 1.2 in the local inertial frame at the neutron star surface compared to the energy measured by the observer in flat space ( see the appendix ) .",

    "the difference in spectral index of the ginga and osse fits probably indicates a true break in the power - law spectrum around 100 kev .",

    "the limit on @xmath50 would be higher since it depends inversely on local field strength .",
    "all the model spectra in figures  [ fig : datpar][fig : daticunpol ] assume emission at the neutron star surface .",
    "emission above the surface would produce higher cutoff energies at a given colatitude , due to the decrease in the dipole field strength with @xmath145 .",
    "the upper limits on colatitude stated above would therefore be less restrictive for non - surface emission .",
    "furthermore , when the field strength at the emission point is @xmath146 ( at height @xmath147 of the neutron star radius ) the splitting and pair production escape energies are comparable , reducing the size of the splitting cascade bumps in all cases . at higher altitudes above the surface , pair production dominates the photon attenuation and conventional pair cascades ( e.g. daugherty & harding 1996 ) would operate .",
    "synchrotron radiation from the pairs would then result in a significantly softer emergent spectrum than the input power - law above the cyclotron energy ( kev at the stellar surface , lower at greater radii ) .",
    "consequently , in order to match the observations , the input power - law would have to be harder , and because of the remoteness of the emission point from the stellar surface , the colatitude of emission would have to be increased substantially .",
    "the results of this paper demonstrate that magnetic photon splitting can have a significant effect on @xmath1-ray emission from the higher field ( @xmath148 g ) pulsars .",
    "it can attenuate the @xmath1-ray spectrum at lower energies than magnetic pair production and will do so without the creation of electron - positron pairs .",
    "we have found that in low fields ( @xmath149 ) and @xmath80 initially , photon splitting attenuation lengths are never shorter than those for pair production . in high fields ( @xmath150 ) ,",
    "photon splitting lengths fall below those for pair production below a certain energy which depends on the colatitude @xmath66 .",
    "photon splitting escape energies fall below pair production escape energies for @xmath151 , so that splitting may produce an observable signature for @xmath1-ray pulsars having strong magnetic fields : high energy spectral cutoffs that are quite polarization - dependent .",
    "while pair creation alone will also generate such cutoffs , their dependence on photon polarization is far diminished from when splitting is active .",
    "we have modeled the shape of such spectral cutoffs through simulation of photon splitting cascades near the neutron star surface for the case of psr1509 - 58 .",
    "two types of cascades result from different assumptions about the selection rules governing the photon splitting modes : the  full splitting cascades \" occur when three modes limited only by cp selection rules operate and the  partial splitting cascades \" occur when only one mode permitted by kinematic selection rules operates . in the full cascades , splitting dominates the attenuation",
    "while in the partial cascades , pair production ultimately limits the rate at which photon energy degrades .",
    "however , the partial cascades show a distinct polarization signature due to the different escape energies for splitting and for pair production . the resulting psr1509 - 58 model spectral cutoffs due to splitting and pair production fall in the required range for virtually all colatitudes @xmath152 .",
    "however , the shape of the spectrum of full splitting cascades , due to the large reprocessing bump , is compatible with the data only for a very small range of colatitudes , @xmath153 . from these results",
    "we conclude that , although photon splitting is capable of producing spectral cutoffs well below egret energies regardless of which selection rules govern the splitting modes , the partial splitting cascades have a much larger range of phase space in which to operate .",
    "attenuation through magnetic pair production and photon splitting near the polar cap will produce @xmath1-ray spectral cutoffs that should be roughly a function of surface magnetic field strength , although other parameters such as polar cap size will come into play .",
    "thus the @xmath1-ray pulsar psr0656 + 14 , having the second highest surface field of @xmath154 g , should have a cutoff energy between that of psr1509 - 58 and the other @xmath1-ray pulsars .",
    "in fact the unusually large spectral index of 2.8 measured by egret ( ramanamurthy et al . 1996",
    ") may be a pair production / photon splitting cutoff .",
    "it is thus possible to understand why psr1509 - 58 , with the highest magnetic field of all the @xmath1-ray pulsars , has by far the lowest spectral cutoff energy and is the only @xmath1-ray pulsar not detected by egret . in the case of vela ( kanbach et al . 1994 ) , geminga ( meyer - hasselwander et al .",
    "1994 ) and 1055 - 52 ( fierro et al . 1993 ) , the spectral cutoffs observed by egret at a few gev are consistent with one - photon pair production cascades ( daugherty and harding 1982 , 1996 ) .",
    "although the escape energies at the neutron star surface for the spin - down fields of these pulsars ( @xmath155 g ) is below 1 gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : icescape]a ) , curvature radiation from primary electrons at one to two stellar radii above the surface will have pair production escape energies of several gev .",
    "however , when the surface field exceeds @xmath156 g , photon splitting becomes the dominant attenuation mechanism in the electromagnetic cascades .",
    "in addition , the primary electrons may lose energy to resonant compton scattering of thermal x - rays from the neutron star surface ( sturner 1995 ) , rather than to curvature radiation , limiting their acceleration to much lower energies , typically @xmath157 .",
    "the resulting upscattered @xmath1-ray spectrum is radiated much closer to the surface and will be cut off by photon splitting well below the egret energy range .",
    "it is important to emphasize that pair creation acting alone suffices to inhibit gev emission in pulsars with spin - down fields as high as psr1509 - 58 , and splitting significantly enhances the attenuation and pushes spectral cutoffs to lower energies .    if resonant compton scattering losses limit the polar cap particle acceleration energies to @xmath158 when @xmath159 g , then the primary particles will radiate @xmath1-rays via the cyclotron upscattering process or cusp ( dermer 1990 ) .",
    "cusp radiation would then provide the seed photons for the splitting cascade .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrum for this process for power - law and monoenergetic electrons scattering thermal blackbody x - ray photons above the neutron star surface ( daugherty & harding 1989 ) is a power - law with maximum energy @xmath160 ( dermer 1990 ) , where @xmath161 is the energy above which the electrons scatter resonantly and @xmath162 k is the thermal x - ray temperature . in the case of psr1509",

    "we would then expect @xmath168 , compatible with our choice of @xmath112 for the splitting cascade models .",
    "a dozen or so other radio pulsars have spin - down magnetic fields above @xmath169 g. these pulsars would , like psr1509 - 58 , have photon splitting dominated cascades rather than pair cascades , producing lower yields of electron - positron pairs .",
    "it is possible that neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields , where splitting is dominant at altitudes up to several stellar radii , do not produce sufficient pairs for coherent radio emission , an intriguing possibility .",

    "we include here some details of our treatment of general relativistic effects on the photon splitting and pair production attenuation in a neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "this treatment follows closely that of gonthier & harding ( 1994 ) , who examined the importance of general relativistic effects on one - photon pair production attenuation in a schwarzschild metric .",
    "they found that several effects of curved spacetime make significant corrections to the attenuation lengths and escape energies for this process , namely the curvature of the photon trajectories , the redshift of the photon energy , and the change in the dipole magnetic field . in the present calculation , the first two effects are included together in the expression for the photon momentum 4-vector .",
    "the curved trajectory of a photon in the schwarzschild metric is confined to a single plane , which we may specify as the x - z plane .",
    "for an observer at rest in the local inertial frame at a radius in the schwarzschild field , the components of the momentum 4-vector are then @xmath170^{1/2}\\,\\erg      \\nonumber \\\\",
    "k^{\\hat{\\vartheta } } & = & { u\\over u_b}\\,\\erg \\nonumber \\\\     k^{\\hat{\\phi } } & = & 0 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "k^{\\hat o } & = & ( 1 - 2u)^{-1/2}\\erg\\quad ,       \\label{eq:4momgr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , with as the scaled stellar mass ( i.e. the schwarzschild radius ) , is the photon energy as observed at infinity , @xmath171 for a neutron star radius of , and @xmath172 is the initial propagation angle of the photon to the radial direction .",
    "the and components of are adapted from equations  ( 13 ) and  ( 14 ) of gonthier & harding ( 1994 ) , follows from the choice of the plane of propagation , and the component can be deduced from the others using .    at the photon emission point , we first determine the angle @xmath172 by performing two coordinate transformations to put the photon momentum 3-vector in the x - z plane . the spacetime trajectory for that photon is then computed and stored in two tables : the first giving the value of @xmath145 as a function of the total pathlength along the trajectory , @xmath173 , from the time - of - flight in the local frame , @xmath174^{1/2 } ( 1 - 2u)^{1/2 } u^2 } } \\quad ,     \\label{eq : itime}\\ ] ] which closely resembles eq .  ( 19 ) of gonthier and harding ( 1994 , which instead measures time in the non - local observer s frame ) , and the second table giving the value of @xmath175 as a function of @xmath145 from the equation , @xmath176 the @xmath145 and @xmath175 are the coordinates in the x - z plane of each point along the photon trajectory . at each distance @xmath26 along the photon path from the emission point , we look up the value of @xmath145 , and from @xmath145 deduce the value of @xmath175 .",
    "these values of @xmath145 and @xmath175 then define the new position and momentum 4-vectors in the x - z plane .",
    "the inverse coordinate transformations of those described above will then give the position and momentum 4-vectors in the frame in which we carry out the attenuation length calculation . to describe the magnetic field in curved spacetime",
    ", we use the expression of wasserman & shapiro ( 1983 ) for the dipole field measured in the local inertial frame in a schwarzschild metric : @xmath177\\hat{r } + \\nonumber \\\\     & & { 3\\over 2}{b_0\\sin\\vartheta\\over { m^2",
    "r}}\\left[\\left({r\\over     { 2m}}-1\\right)\\ln\\left(1-{2m\\over r}\\right)+1-{m\\over r}\\right ]     \\left(1-{2m\\over r}\\right)^{-1/2}\\hat{\\vartheta}\\quad .",
    "\\label{eq : bcurv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this expression in gh94 has a typographical error in the @xmath178 component . for @xmath179 and @xmath180 km ,",
    "as used in this paper , the dipole field strength at the neutron star surface at the pole from equation  ( [ eq : bcurv ] ) is a factor @xmath181 times the flat space value .    the angle @xmath10 , obtained by taking the dot product between the photon momentum 4-vector and the local dipole field , is given in curved spacetime by @xmath182^{1/2 } + { b^{\\hat{\\vartheta } } \\over b } { ( 1 - 2u)^{1/2}u\\over u_b}\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : thetakb}\\ ] ] since the field components and defined by in equation  ( [ eq : bcurv ] ) are differentiable functions of , it follows from equation  ( [ eq : thetakb ] ) that is also differentiable in . note also that the pathlength defined through equation  ( [ eq : itime ] ) gives smooth at all positions above the stellar surface .",
    "consequently , the implicit function has a well - behaved taylor series expansion ( i.e. there is no singularity ) about ( i.e. ) .",
    "hence , cases where we set result in along the photon trajectory for , regardless of whether the spacetime is curved or flat .",
    "this proportionality is responsible for certain limiting behaviors in the attenuation lengths and escape energies discussed in sections  2.3 and  2.4 .",
