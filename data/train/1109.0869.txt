    "the primary task of the nasa _ kepler mission _ is to detect the periodic dips in brightness caused by extrasolar planets transiting their host stars @xcite . to accomplish this",
    ", the _ kepler _ space telescope simultaneously monitors the brightness of up to 150,000 stars .",
    "while most of these stars are observed with a mean ` long ' cadence of 29.4 minutes , a subset of up to 512 stars at any one time may be observed with a mean ` short ' cadence of 58.85 seconds .",
    "these high - precision , short - cadence observations make the data suitable for asteroseismic studies of solar - type stars @xcite , which can precisely determine the stellar structure from their resonant modes of oscillation .    during the complete _ kepler mission _",
    ", approximately 160,000 stars will be surveyed in a field covering over 100 square degrees . the stellar classification project ( scp ) was initiated in the pre - launch phase of the _ kepler mission _ to carry out ground - based photometric classification of the targets in the _ kepler _ field and to construct the _ kepler input catalog _ ( kic ) @xcite .",
    "the primary task of the scp was to accurately distinguish giants from dwarfs in order to select solar - type stars which may have detectable transits of planets orbiting in the habitable zone .",
    "the kic also provided estimates of @xmath5 , @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath6 from the analysis of multi - colour photometry , and derived properties ( radius , mass and luminosity ) from a simplified mass - radius relationship . since most of the stars in the _ kepler _ field - of - view had not been studied prior to the scp , the classifications given in the kic are often the only physical data available .    in order to characterise the structure of a super - earth",
    ", the planetary radius should be known to a precision of @xmath7% and the mass to within 10% @xcite . to confirm the detection of an earth - sized exoplanet based on its size requires the planetary radius",
    "to be similarly well - defined . as",
    "the transit signature only gives the planetary radius relative to that of the host star , it is essential to obtain an estimate of the stellar radius to a similar precision in order to fully characterise an exoplanetary system .",
    "the survey phase of the _ kepler _ asteroseismology program took place during the first 10 months of science operations . over this time",
    "more than 2600 stars were observed at short cadence , most for a duration of approximately one month .",
    "a small number were observed for the complete survey phase , giving higher frequency resolution in their acoustic power spectra .",
    "the asteroseismic properties of some of these stars have been analysed in detail , identifying individual p - mode frequencies that have been used to model their structures @xcite .",
    "the average asteroseismic parameters have been measured in a large ensemble of stars observed during the survey and have been used to determine physical properties and to test synthetic stellar populations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate precise radii and surface gravities from the average asteroseismic parameters of 514 solar - type stars observed during the survey .",
    "these stars cover a range in apparent magnitude from 7.0 to 12.0 and a range in @xmath5 from 4400k to 6900k .",
    "we use these asteroseismic structural parameters to verify the accuracy and precision of the physical properties given in the kic .",
    "there is insufficient telemetry bandwidth to monitor all of the stars in the _ kepler _ field - of - view so targets are selected in order to maximise the probability of detecting a planetary transit around a solar - type star .",
    "of particular interest is the detection of an earth - sized planet in the habitable zone of a sun - like star .",
    "therefore , the primary task of the kic is to correctly distinguish giants from dwarfs .    the aims and methods used for stellar classification in the kic",
    "are described in detail by @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief summary .",
    "the physical data were derived from ground - based photometric observations in five bands ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the stellar values of @xmath5 , @xmath0 , [ fe / h ] and @xmath6 were determined using bayesian posterior probability maximisation to match the observed colours to stellar atmosphere models .",
    "the values of @xmath0 derived from this method were then used directly to identify giants , defined as having @xmath9dex .",
    "the kic also gives estimates of radii , which were derived from @xmath0 assuming a mass - radius relationship that depends only on @xmath5 . as stated explicitly by @xcite ,",
    "this is true only in a statistical sense and takes no account of composition or evolutionary state .",
    "the accuracy of the primary stellar properties in the kic is stated to be 0.4dex for @xmath0 and @xmath10200k for @xmath5 , with the ability to distinguish main - sequence stars from giants estimated to be reliable to 98% confidence for stars with @xmath11k @xcite .",
    "the frequency of maximum oscillation power , @xmath12 , and the average large frequency separation , @xmath13 , can be obtained from the one - month _ kepler _ light curves using a number of different techniques @xcite .",
    "these characteristic asteroseismic parameters are sensitive to the globally - averaged stellar structure . to obtain estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath14 from @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", we used the yale - birmingham ( yb ) pipeline grid - based technique @xcite .",
    "we tested the results obtained from the yb pipeline against those of similar methods @xcite and found them to be consistent .",
    "the grid - based method determines the characteristics of stars by finding the maximum of the likelihood function of the set of input parameters @xmath15\\}$ ] calculated with respect to a grid of stellar evolution models .",
    "the uncertainties on the derived @xmath0 and @xmath14 were determined from the observational uncertainties on the input parameters and the priors that had been used to construct the stellar models .",
    "it should be noted that the seismic parameters calculated for the stellar models rely on the approximate scaling relations : @xmath16 @xmath17    equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) assumes that the average large frequency separation scales as the square root of the mean stellar density .",
    "this relation has previously been tested using a wide range of stellar models @xcite .",
    "@xcite tested the validity of equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) using models with a broad range of masses and evolutionary states and found a deviation from the scaling relation that is predominantly a function of @xmath5 . according to @xcite , any systematic error introduced as a result of the deviation from equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) is largest for low - mass stars with @xmath18k , where the value of @xmath13 calculated for the stellar models may be underestimated by up to @xmath19% , and smallest for stars with @xmath20k and @xmath21k , where any deviation from equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) is negligible . for main - sequence stars with masses above @xmath22@xmath23 , which includes the majority of the stars in our sample , @xcite state that it is best not to include their correction to the scaling law .",
    "as the stars in our sample cover a range of metallicities , masses and effective temperatures where any correction to the scaling relation is small , there should be no average systematic bias introduced as a result of assuming equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : numax ] ) relies on the assumption that the frequency of maximum power should scale with the acoustic cut - off frequency @xcite . unlike equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) , this has not been tested thoroughly with stellar models because there is less confidence in the theoretical predictions of the excitation and damping rates .",
    "the @xmath12 scaling has been tested empirically by @xcite who concluded that it should be reliable to a few percent and that the net bias on stellar properties as a result of assuming both scaling laws is no larger than the quoted uncertainties obtained from the grid method .",
    "the asteroseismic scaling laws are discussed in more detail and tested using _ kepler _",
    "observations of main - sequence and giant stars in @xcite .",
    "the kic determinations of @xmath0 , @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] were performed simultaneously , therefore to obtain a self - consistent comparison we used only the values of @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] given in the kic as input to the seismic analysis . in the case of [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the values given in the kic are known to be imprecise .",
    "we therefore adopted a very large uncertainty of 0.5dex in [ fe / h ] so that the seismically determined values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 were not significantly sensitive to metallicity . the large uncertainty in [ fe / h ] is reflected in the derived uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "it has been suggested that the values of @xmath5 given in the kic are systematically too low for solar - type stars .",
    "pinsonneault et al .",
    "( in preparation ) have used an alternative analysis of the raw photometry in the kic , based on the method described in @xcite , and found @xmath5 that are on average @xmath7% higher than those given in the kic .",
    "a spectroscopic analysis of a sample of @xmath24 stars has been performed by bruntt et al .",
    "( in preparation ) who found @xmath5 values that are on average @xmath25% higher than those in the kic",
    ". however , as it was our intention to test the kic values of @xmath0 and the radii derived from these , both of which depend on the kic derived @xmath5 , we used the kic estimates of @xmath5 to calculate the seismic values for @xmath0 and @xmath14 .    using",
    "the kic @xmath5 provided a uniform set of temperatures for the stars under study and ensured that any systematic bias was not introduced as a result of using temperatures from another catalog .",
    "it should be noted that due to the weak dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath5 , an increase of 5% in @xmath5 corresponds to an increase of only 0.01dex in the seismically determined @xmath0 , and a decrease of only 1.2% in the seismically determined @xmath14 .    to test the robustness of the seismically determined values of @xmath0 and @xmath14",
    ", we applied the grid - based method to the sets of results for @xmath12 and @xmath13 determined by five of the methods described in @xcite that provided the greatest coverage over all stars with detected oscillations .",
    "the yb pipeline was run with three different underlying model grids to determine the stellar properties @xcite , giving up to 15 values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 for each star .",
    "the mean uncertainty in @xmath0 calculated using all methods and model grids was 0.025dex .",
    "the mean standard deviation of the results from all methods and model grids was 0.007dex . in the case of @xmath14 , the mean relative uncertainty was 7.0% , while the mean standard deviation was 2.7% .",
    "the seismically determined stellar properties were therefore found to be insensitive to the choice of model grid or method used to determine @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the level of precision available .",
    "since the scatter in the results was significantly smaller than the stated uncertainties , we compared the mean values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 to those in the kic .",
    "the distributions of the differences between seismic and kic values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hist ] . as the seismic radii span a range from 0.7 to 6.4@xmath3 ,",
    "the relative differences rather than the absolute differences are used .",
    "this necessarily causes a skewed distribution as the lower limit is fixed at @xmath26% .",
    "the standard deviations of these distributions are 0.31dex ( @xmath0 ) and 37% ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the median values of the distributions indicate that there are significant biases in @xmath27 ( @xmath28dex ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30% ) .",
    "since the radii given in the kic were derived directly from @xmath0 , an overestimation bias in @xmath0 causes an underestimation bias in @xmath14 , since @xmath31 ( in solar units ) . through this relationship , for a star with @xmath32dex , an overestimation of @xmath33dex in @xmath0 results in an underestimation of @xmath34% in @xmath14 .",
    "[ [ sect : logg ] ]    a comparison of seismic and kic values of @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : logg ] . assuming an uncertainty of 0.4dex for @xmath27",
    ", we find 11 stars ( 2% of our sample ) that would be identified as dwarfs using @xmath27 but are classified as giants using asteroseismology ( these stars are plotted as crosses in fig .  [",
    "fig : logg ] ) .",
    "we find that , on average , the kic @xmath0 follows the seismic @xmath0 when @xmath35dex .",
    "there is no bias apparent in the @xmath0 differences for these stars and the @xmath36 agreement is at the 0.27dex level .",
    "this agrees with the results in @xcite who showed that the values of @xmath0 in the kic are consistent with those determined from the seismology of large cohort of red giants observed by _",
    "kepler _ , with the majority having @xmath37dex .",
    "the agreement becomes poorer for stars with @xmath1dex , with the values in the kic on average being systematically higher than the seismically determined @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour was noted by @xcite , who state that the kic classifications tend to give @xmath0 too large for subgiants .",
    "there are two observational biases that may contribute to this discrepancy .",
    "firstly , malmquist bias increases the fraction of intrinsically brighter objects in the field , increasing the proportion of subgiants in the sample relative to their true number density .",
    "secondly , the amplitude of oscillations , and therefore their detectability , scales approximately with @xmath38 , and therefore oscillations are preferentially detected for stars with lower @xmath0 .",
    "these two observational effects combine to give a relatively high fraction of subgiants in the seismic sample .",
    "this is evident in the seismic @xmath0 distribution , which peaks around a value of 4.0dex .",
    "the known shortfalls of the kic lead to the overestimation of @xmath0 for these subgiants .",
    "the average overestimation bias for stars with @xmath1dex is 0.23dex with a @xmath36 scatter about this bias of 0.30dex .",
    "our findings confirm the warning given by @xcite that users should be wary of @xmath27 values for stars with photometric colours @xmath39 .",
    "most of the stars in the seismic sample fall into this range .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : logg ] shows the difference between kic and seismic @xmath0 as a function of @xmath40 . in the region where the kic has shortfalls in the determination of @xmath0 ,",
    "the results from seismology can be used to complement the kic results and perform an empirical correction .",
    "we note that the absolute photometry in the kic is very reliable , with an estimated error of just 1.5% on the @xmath40 colour estimates .",
    "the kic provides estimates of stellar radii derived from @xmath0 and a simplified mass - radius relationship .",
    "asteroseismology can provide more precise estimates of the stellar radius @xcite , however most stars for which transits are observed will not have detectable oscillations .",
    "the relationships between @xmath0 , mass and radius are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massrel ] for the kic and seismic values .",
    "it is clear that there is more variation in radius for a given @xmath0 in the seismic data than appears in the kic , which is not surprising because the kic relationship is assumed to be valid only in a statistical sense . through the kic mass - radius relationship ,",
    "the overestimation bias identified in @xmath27 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : logg ] ) appears as an underestimation bias in @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig : radius ] compares the kic radii with those determined from seismology",
    ". an underestimation bias of up to 50% is apparent for stars with @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "using the kic radii would imply that 20% of the stars on which we have detected oscillations have radii within 0.2@xmath3 of the solar value .",
    "however , the results from seismology prove that fewer than 3% of the stars with detected oscillations are within this range .",
    "it must be stressed that the same observational biases described in sect .",
    "[ sect : logg ] apply equally to the results for stellar radii .",
    "the cohort of stars that has been used in this comparison is subject to selection effects as this only includes the relatively small fraction of stars observed by _",
    "kepler _ that have detected oscillations .",
    "this is biased towards stars with higher @xmath38 and may not be representative of all stars in the kic .    for stars with @xmath41@xmath3 ,",
    "the standard deviation of the distribution of relative differences between kic and seismic radii is 35% and no average bias is apparent .",
    "however , for stars with @xmath42@xmath3 , a dichotomy is present whereby cool stars ( @xmath43k ) tend to fall above the agreement line and hot stars ( @xmath44k ) fall below it .",
    "these stars correspond to the extremes of the @xmath40 plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : logg ] . for hot stars with @xmath45 , the bias reverses sign and @xmath27 is underestimated by up to 0.25dex , leading to an overestimation of @xmath29 by up to 50% .",
    "any empirical correction to the data in the kic should therefore be done as a function of @xmath40 and not as a function of @xmath27 or @xmath29 .",
    "using precise values of @xmath0 determined from the asteroseismic analysis of a large ensemble of solar - like oscillators , we have found that in its primary role the kic effectively distinguishes dwarfs from giants .",
    "however , at the level of precision available to the asteroseismic parameters , we find an overestimation bias for stars with @xmath1dex , although this bias may be overstated relative to the full catalog due to selection effects in the asteroseismic sample .    for stars with @xmath35dex , on average",
    "we find an unbiased agreement between the seismic and kic values , with a @xmath36 deviation of 0.27dex . this precision is higher than was estimated in @xcite ( 0.4dex ) .",
    "however , due to the presence of a significant number of subgiants in our sample , and the known shortfalls of the kic that result in an overestimation of @xmath0 for these stars , a representative uncertainty of 0.4dex for @xmath27 is nevertheless probably appropriate .",
    "the radii given in the kic are affected by the overestimated values of @xmath0 and as a result may be underestimated by up to 50% for stars with @xmath2@xmath3 . for stars with @xmath29 larger than this , the agreement is better with a relative @xmath36 deviation of 35% .",
    "this is important to take into account if the kic radii are used to estimate the number of @xmath46@xmath3 stars in our sample .",
    "the results from asteroseismology show that a much smaller number of stars with detected oscillations have radii close to @xmath47@xmath3 when compared with the radii given in the kic .",
    "this bias may lead to an underestimation of the radii of exoplanets transiting the affected stars if the kic radius is used to calculate the planetary radius @xcite , however the bias is strongest for subgiants and may be considered an upper limit for less evolved stars .",
    "although the kic was not designed primarily to give values of @xmath0 and @xmath14 to high precision , we find that the catalog may be used to give an indication of these stellar properties once the limitations outlined above are taken into account .",
    "much better estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath14 are available from asteroseismology for stars with detected solar - like oscillations .",
