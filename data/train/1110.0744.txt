    "multi - layer heterostructures are widely used in different devices , such as bi- or monopolar heterosrtucture lasers , photodetectors and solar cells , see reviews @xcite or @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "thicknesses of layers in such structures are varied widely , starting from an ultranarrow layer ( unl ) of thickness @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is the monolayer thickness and @xmath2 is a number of monolayers ) for a single or several monolayer structures , e.g. the case of the quantum dot sheets with ultranarrow wetting layers , see refs .",
    "the case of @xmath3 corresponds to a wide well or a barrier which are described in the framework of the effective mass approximation ( ema ) or the @xmath4-method supplied by appropriate boundary conditions at heterointerfaces .",
    "@xcite early in the eighties , similar approaches were used for description of abrupt heterojunctions between different bulk semiconductors , see @xcite and references in ref .",
    "the electronic properties of short - period superlattices ( sl ) , i. e. heterostructures formed by periodical unls , were studied experimentally and numerically based on different approximations , see refs .",

    "these approaches determine the energy spectra of sl only but they are not suitable for consideration of transport and optical phenomena . to the best of our knowledge , an effect of unls on these phenomena was not considered in details because the effective mass approximation is not valid over scales @xmath5 .",
    "if a heterostructure includes unl , one should consider it as _ a new object _ which is described by boundary conditions added to the ema equations at unl s positions , @xmath6 . because heterostructures with unls are routinely used in different optoelectronic devices without an investigation of the peculiarities mentioned , it is important and timely to develop an adequate theory of electronic states at unl and to perform a verification of unl s parameters .",

    "the parameters of such a matrix are restricted by the current conservation condition and the boundary conditions are written below for a symmetric unl , see figs .",

    "depending on the diagonal element of transfer matrix @xmath9 introduced in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , one should separate of unls into three categories : ( i ) a well - like unl with @xmath13 , ( ii ) a barrier - like unl with @xmath7 , and ( iii ) a non - conventional unl with @xmath8 .",
    "these cases are sketched in figs .",
    "1a - 1c , respectively , where thicknesses of layers ( filled in by grey ) are comparable to @xmath0 . while the cases ( i ) or ( ii ) correspond to ema description of a narrow well or a barrier at @xmath14 , @xcite a non - conventional unl has no simple ema analogy . in general",

    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) below .",
    "these phenomenological parameters determine a character of low - energy states together with the effective mass ( or parameters of @xmath4-method , if energy is comparable to gap of host semiconductor ) and they should be determined from experimental data .    here we have evaluated the transfer matrix which is written through the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( or through characteristic energy @xmath17 ) and have considered electronic properties of different types of single unls as well as sl formed by unls .",
    "we calculated the binding energy of localized state at a single unl , which appears to be allowed state for the cases ( i ) and ( iii ) and to be forbidden state for the barrier - like case ( ii ) .",
    "the energy - dependent reflection ( transmission ) coefficient is found when considering the scattering of electron on unl .",
    "for the sl formed by unls , we analyze the energy spectrum , the density of states , and the absorption coefficient due to photoexcitation of localized electrons under thz or mid - ir excitation .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that these properties are modified essentially under variation of the unl s characteristics and we discuss possibilities for verification of the transfer matrix parameters .",
    "the consideration below is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we describe an unl in the framework of the transfer matrix approach .",
    "the single - layer case is considered in sect .",
    "iii and the properties of sl formed by unl are considered in sect .",
    "iv . discussion on experimental verification of unl s parameters is performed in sect . v. concluding remarks and list of assumptions used",
    "are given in the last section .",
    "within the one - band effective mass approximation , the electronic states in bulk semiconductor with an unl placed at @xmath6 is described by the schrodinger equation : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the effective mass and @xmath20 is the momentum operator .",
    "the second - order differential equation ( 1 ) should be solved with the boundary conditions which connect the wave functions and their first derivatives at @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "similarly to the consideration of an abrupt heterojunction case , @xcite we write the connection rules for the column @xmath23 in the form : @xmath24 the @xmath25 transfer matrix @xmath26 is determined by the current conservation requirement and by the symmetry properties of layer .    from eq .",
    "( 1 ) it follows that @xmath27 does not dependent on @xmath28 if @xmath11 ( here and below @xmath29 is the pauli matrix which connects @xmath30 and its derivative ) .",
    "we impose the current conservation requirement at unl as @xmath31 .",
    "since two arbitrary states @xmath32 and @xmath23 are considered here , the current conservation gives the condition for the transfer matrix : @xmath33 see similar evaluation for heterojunction in ref .",
    "further , we restrict ourselves by the case of symmetric unl , when @xmath23 and @xmath34 should be determined by the same equations . as a result one obtains the additional condition : @xmath35 and 4 complex parameters of @xmath26 should be determined from 8 conditions given by eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "straightforward calculations give us the transfer matrix @xmath36 written through real parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . since the determinant is fixed here , the matrix @xmath26 depends on two real parameters which should be considered as phenomenological characteristics of unl .    at @xmath40 ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the phase , @xmath15 , and wave vector , @xmath16 , so that the transfer matrix takes the form : @xmath41 which depends on two phenomenological parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 , one can use similar expressions for @xmath45 which is written through the hyperbolic functions : @xmath46 here the signs @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . once again , we suppose @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) because @xmath15 can have any sign .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be written for @xmath3 , when @xmath26 can be evaluated within the ema approximation , for the wide layer cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "for the @xmath49-monolayer well or barrier of the thickness @xmath1 with the band offset @xmath50 and the effective mass @xmath51 , one obtains the transfer matrix @xmath26 or @xmath52 given by eqs .",
    "( 6 ) or ( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are determined by @xmath53 where the characteristic energy @xmath17 is introduced . for the case of inas well placed in gaas",
    "@xcite one obtains that the energy @xmath17 varies between 1 - 2.8 ev depending on the mismatch stress contributions .",
    "the phase @xmath15 varies between @xmath54 - @xmath55n , where @xmath3 [ for the case ( i ) , @xmath15 should be reduced to the interval ( 0 , @xmath56 ) ] .",
    "similar estimates can be obtained for other heterostructures with well- or barrier - like unl .",
    "notice , that the non - conventional case @xmath8 described by matrix @xmath57 has no analogy with the results for well or barrier described by eq .",

    "the odd peaks are non - symmetric ones , they are higher ( see the scaling factors in fig . 7 ) and more narrow in comparison to the even peaks which are more symmetric and wide . since the condition @xmath207 is satisfied at @xmath20810 nm , a visible ( @xmath20930% ) absorption takes place for 20-layer periodic structure and the mid - ir measurements permit a direct verification of the sl parameters .",
    "next , we briefly discuss possibilities for experimental verification or for _ ab initio _ calculations of the unl s parameters .",
    "it is not a simple task because the unl s parameters affect on response of heterostructure in a complicated way and one needs to design an appropriate structure and to perform special measurements .",
    "also , any first - principle calculations of the unl s parameters should include both unl and host material , so that it is necessary to perform calculations on atomic level for a long period sl in order to compare with the results of sect .",

    "any method used for short - period sl , see @xcite and refs .",

    "different optoelectronic devices contain the quantum dot sheets with an ultranarrow wetting layer @xcite and influence of these layers on electronic states is described by the results obtained here if one neglects the quantum dots effect .",
    "unls with @xmath2115 are widely used in the quantum cascade lasers , @xcite where each period contains about 10 layers of different thickness , so that a verification of unl s parameters is difficult .",
    "at least several measurements of inas unls placed into gaas or algaas matrix @xcite as well as results for unls in a@xmath212b@xmath213 @xcite and in a@xmath214b@xmath213 @xcite heterostructures were published . but a verification of unl s parameters was not performed in these papers and a special investigation for each system is necessary .",
    "all the results obtained in sect .",
    "iv depend strongly on @xmath15 and @xmath17 , which determine the transfer matrices ( 6 ) or ( 7 ) , and these parameters can be verified from the spectroscopical measurements . indeed , the results of sect .",
    "ivb demonstrate that mid - ir ( or thz , depending on parameters in question ) absorption is strongly varied depending on transfer matrix parameters .",

    "variations of the near - ir spectra from the bulk case permit one to verify @xmath15 and @xmath17 using the electromodulation spectroscopy or the ple measurements .",
    "beside this , the transfer matrix parameters can be extracted from the transport data but in addition to unl s parameters , some other characteristics , e. g. scattering rates , should be involved under interpretation of these data .",
    "in summary , we have re - examined the theory of electronic states in the heterostructures formed by ultranarrow layers taking into account that the ema approximation can not be applied for description of unls .",
    "our consideration is based on the transfer matrix method which was generalized for the case of unl .",
    "it is found that the three types of unl are possible depending on a value of diagonal element in the transfer matrix ( 5 ) .",
    "the cases @xmath13 or @xmath7 are similar to narrow well or barrier while there is no simple analogy with a wide layer for the non - conventional unl with @xmath8 .",
    "the localized level appears at single unl with @xmath66 .",
    "the energy - dependent reflection coefficient of a single unl as well as the energy spectrum of sl formed by a periodical array of unls are different for the cases @xmath13 and @xmath7 .",
    "the spectral dependencies of absorption are analyzed for the case of photoexcitation of localized electrons into sl s minibands . the ema approach fails to explain the results of ref .",
    "15 but there is a luck of experimental data for verification of unl s parameters .    let us discuss now the main assumptions applied to the consideration performed . using the single - band hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 1 ) we suppose that electron energy @xmath96 is small in comparison with the gap of the host semiconductor . in order to consider the high - energy states , one needs to use * kp*-hamiltonian and more complicated boundary conditions , see similar consideration of abrupt heterojunction in refs . 8 and 21 .",
    "in addition , the transfer matrix approach is valid for description of unl of width @xmath1 if @xmath1 is less than electron wavelength , i. e. @xmath215 . we restrict ourselves by the model of symmetric unl based on the condition ( 4 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the ema - based estimates given by eq .",
    "( 8) are not valid for @xmath216 at least for inas unls , see discussion in ref .",
    "a more complicated consideration is necessary in order to take into account a non - symmetry of unl ; this case will be considered elsewhere .",
    "also , we consider ideal unl neglecting an in - plane scattering processes or inhomogeneous broadening ; this approximation is valid if @xmath96 exceeds a typical broadening energy",
    ". a possible segregation of unls ( some experimental data for inas see in @xcite ) will not be essential because a short - scale lateral inhomogeneities is realized .    to conclude , we believe that the results obtained will stimulate a verification of phenomenological parameters describing the electronic properties of unls using the mid - ir spectroscopy when the valence band states are not essential .",
    "these data should be important for applications of heterostructures with unls in different devices .",
