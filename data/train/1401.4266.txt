    "the standard model ( sm ) @xcite provides a remarkably successful description of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions at the energy scale up to @xmath9 .",
    "it implies the conservation of baryon number @xmath10 and lepton number @xmath8 as the automatic consequence of gauge invariance and renormalizability . despite its tremendous success ,",
    "the sm suffers from some conceptional difficulties , such as the hierarchy problem and the nonoccurrence of gauge coupling unification at high energy scale .",
    "supersymmetry theories may provide solutions for such problems , and are widely expected as the most appealing extensions of the sm .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm with minimal particle content is called minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . to prevent proton from rapid decay @xcite ,",
    "a multiplicative @xmath1-parity is introduced as @xmath11 in terms of @xmath10 , @xmath8 and spin quantum number @xmath12 @xcite , which leaves all the sm particles @xmath13 while for their superpartners @xmath14 .",
    "the conservation of the @xmath1-parity imposes strict simultaneous @xmath10 and @xmath8 symmetry , and results in a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which can be a candidate for dark matter if it is color and electrically neutral .",
    "however , such a stringent symmetry appears to be short of theoretical basis , especially as it is known that a stable proton can survive by requiring only either @xmath10 or @xmath8 conservation and partial lepton - flavor violation should be introduced to accommodate neutrino oscillations .",
    "consequently , the @xmath1-parity - violating ( rpv ) interactions could be included into the most general representation of the superpotential as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 are generation indices , while @xmath17 isospin and @xmath18 color indices are suppressed . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the lepton and quark @xmath17 left - handed doublet chiral superfields , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the right - handed singlets , and @xmath24 is the left - handed up - type higgs doublet .",
    "the bilinear terms @xmath25 , denoting the mixture of higgs and lepton superfields , will generate neutrino masses in a natural way .",
    "the trilinear terms @xmath26 and @xmath3 with dimensionless rpv yukawa couplings @xmath27 and @xmath28 only violate @xmath8 symmetry , while the @xmath29-parameterized trilinear terms @xmath30 only break baryon - number conservation .",
    "the constraints on the rpv couplings have been derived by precise measurements of low energy processes and decays , and are well summarized in the literature @xcite .",
    "the most distinctive phenomenology of the @xmath1-parity - violating mssm ( @xmath31-mssm ) is that , the lsp is no longer stable and is not necessarily an electrically neutral and uncolored particle . as a consequence , supersymmetric scalar leptons and quarks , such as the lighter sbottom @xmath32 , can be candidates for the lsp , and the massive scalar fermion lsp can only decays into ordinary sm particles after its single / pair production at high erergy colliders . as we know , the bottom squark could be pair - produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) via qcd interactions .",
    "the production rates and the differential distributions with respect to some kinematical variables , including the next - to - leading order qcd corrections @xcite and the electroweak contributions @xcite , have been calculated in several susy scenarios .",
    "as shown in @xmath33 , the cross section for the sbottom pair production at the lhc decreases by @xmath34 orders of magnitude as the increment of @xmath35 from @xmath36 to about @xmath37 , due to the drastic reduction of the final state phase space and the smallness of parton densities in proton at large @xmath38 .",
    ".[table0-locs - lhc ] leading order cross sections for sbottom - antisbottom production at the lhc .",
    "the results for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are quoted from refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]    + as shown in @xmath41 , the relative corrections induced by these contributions to the rpv signal cross section and the luminosity required for the @xmath42 discovery of the lighter sbottom resonance , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are almost less then @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the numerical results and conclusion of the paper are reasonable . *",
    "the above lighter sbottom resonance searching strategy can be easily translated to probing the lighter scalar top @xmath46 ( assuming to be the lsp ) and the lepton - number - violating @xmath47-type yukawa interaction , via @xmath48 process in @xmath49 collision at the lhec . however , due to the lower luminosity of positron beam and the smaller fraction of energetic valence @xmath50-quark density in proton against electron beam and @xmath51-quark density , the potential of the discovery of the lighter stop resonance or the constraint on the relevant rpv coupling in @xmath49 scattering would be diminished , compared to the sbottom resonance search in @xmath6 collision mode .",
    "in this paper , the possibility of probing the lepton - number - violating @xmath3 @xmath4-type interaction in the deep inelastic scattering at the lhec is investigated . under the single coupling dominance hypothesis that all the rpv couplings except @xmath4 are zero , the lighter sbottom can be produced and subsequently decay into electron and jet .",
    "taking advantage of the enhancement of the narrow width resonant production of sbottom and distinctive kinematic distributions of @xmath52 decay products in the c.m .",
    "frame of the two - body final state , an optimized event selection strategy can be developed to improve the sensitivity of the rpv signal over sm background . with",
    "about @xmath5 integrated luminosity expected in @xmath2 @xmath6 collision at the lhec , either the lighter sbottom rpv resonance could be directly detected up to @xmath7 , or a new @xmath53 c.l .",
    "upper bound on the @xmath8-violating coupling @xmath4 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained from the ckm matrix element @xmath54 , could be derived ."
