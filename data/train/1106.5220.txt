    "heavy fermions with masses 300 - 500 gev and even heavier have been suggested recently to explain new results on cp violation in b decays @xcite .",

    "the nature of bound states made of such heavy particles is different from that for usual hadrons .",
    "the strength of the attraction between heavy particles due to the higgs boson exchange increases with the particle mass .",
    "this may lead to formation of a new type of bound states .",
    "the higgs - induced bags made of heavy fermions and bosons have been considered in numerous publications - see e.g. .",
    "an alternative , but relative line of recent research addressed the problem of a possible dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking that may take place if the fourth generation is present @xcite .    in several our previous works we concentrated mainly on ",
    "magic \" bag consisting of 6 heavy quarks and 6 antiquarks ( altogether @xmath4 particles ) occupying @xmath5 shell .",
    "its advantage is that it gives arguably the lowest limit on the fermion mass , which guarantees the binding .",
    "besides , such multifermion bags may play a role in bariogenesis . however , these fermion bags are very difficult targets for possible observation at accelerators . having this in mind in the present paper we consider the higgs - induced bound states of only two fermions",
    ". the problem has recently been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the relativistic as well as radiative corrections induced by the fermion polarization were considered . to make our calculations accurate and reliable we consider a number of important corrections including the relativistic and retardation corrections , as well as the radiative corrections .",
    "it should be emphasized that the retardation plays a very essential role in the problem , which makes it necessary to consider it alongside the relativistic correction .",
    "to describe the joint contribution of the relativistic and retardation corrections we derive the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for the higgs - induced potential , which includes all @xmath6 relativistic corrections .",
    "this approach is similar in nature to the way the breit correction is usually accounted for in qed .",
    "our hamiltonian - based treatment provides the convenient flexibility which allows it to be applied to a variety of similar problems in the future .    to calculate the radiative corrections we employ the conventional methods developed previously to calculate the lamb shift in atoms , see e.g. @xcite . following the calculations of @xcite we express the radiative correction in terms of the renormalized higgs vertex correction , which gives the fermion self - energy , and the renormalized higgs polarization operator for the fermion loops .",
    "it should be stressed that the vertex correction derived for the first time in @xcite proves to be very large and has the sign opposite to the polarization correction , which makes it necessary to include it in the calculations .",
    "( compare the lamb shift problem , where the self - energy correction dominates ) .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation with an effective hamiltonian which includes the nonrelativistic yukawa hamiltonian , the breit - type relativistic terms and the radiative corrections , and find the ground state .",
    "due to the short - range character of the interaction , the higgs - induced bound state is formed only if the particle mass exceeds the limit , which is found to be @xmath7 . when the long - range coulomb interaction or the gluon exchange are included , the bound states exists for an arbitrary mass .",
    "we found that the higgs - induced interaction produces an an interesting effect on these states even for @xmath8 .",
    "the higgs induced interaction dramatically increases the binding energy and reduces the size of the bound state .",
    "for @xmath9 the binding energy increases @xmath10 times and the size decreases @xmath10 times where @xmath11 is the constant of the higgs exchange potential and @xmath12 is the constant of the long - range potential .",
    "it is convenient to start from the simple non - relativistic approximation . in the center of mass reference",
    "frame the interaction between two fermions due to the higgs boson exchange may be described by the following hamiltonian ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the yukawa - type interaction induced by the higgs exchange @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the higgs mass , and @xmath18 is the effective constant describing the strength of the interaction . within the standard model @xmath19 where @xmath20 gev is the higgs vev",
    ".    numerical solution of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) gives the bound state for @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to the particle mass @xmath22 a similar estimate was made previously in @xcite . for @xmath23 gev",
    "we obtain @xmath24 gev . this is larger than the critical mass @xmath25 gev , which was found in @xcite for the bag of 12 fermions , but",
    "the distinction is not dramatic . to put it in perspective",
    "it is instructive to compare it with the situation when the bound state of the pair is produced by the heavy fermion interacting with some known , relatively light particle , when the critical mass proves to be much larger .",
    "for example , when the heavy fermion interacts with the t - quark the critical mass of the heavy particle is over 2 tev . in the present work we do not consider so heavy particles .",
    "the higgs potential may be important even for @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , the bound state for @xmath26 may be produced by a relatively weak long - range interaction @xmath27 where @xmath28 for the electrostatic interaction between charged leptons or @xmath29 due to the gluon - exchange @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention here by the color singlet state of the pair . generally speaking",
    "the pair of quarks can be in the octet state as well .",
    "however , it is known that the effective potential for the octet is repulsive , and what is worse , the octet pair of heavy quarks can not exist by itself ; its colored state needs the presence of additional , probably light quarks , which would compensate it .",
    "the constant @xmath30 in eqs.([vl ] ) , ( [ vg ] ) is substantially smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "it is shown below that when the particle mass @xmath1 is approaching @xmath2 , the binding energy increases @xmath32 times .    to estimate the energy we start from the variational approach , which gives accuracy about 10% ( below we will perform accurate numerical calculations ) .",
    "take the variational ground state wave function in the hydrogen - like form @xmath33 then from the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) one finds the following expectation value for the energy @xmath34 the minimization of @xmath35 gives the equation on @xmath36 @xmath37 let us first find the critical condition for the bound state to appear .",
    "combining equation ( [ qh ] ) with @xmath38 one finds @xmath39 a similar estimate was made previously in @xcite .",
    "the last condition allows one to find for the critical mass @xmath40 , which only slightly , by @xmath41 exceeds the corresponding value in ( [ mcr ] ) extracted from numerical calculations .",
    "let us add to the energy the contribution of the long - range potential @xmath42 .",
    "then we need to find the eigenvalue @xmath43 of the hamiltonian @xmath44 .",
    "following the variational approximation we find then @xmath45 in the absence of the short - range potential , when @xmath46 , these equations obviously reproduce the exact coulomb - type wave function with @xmath47 and energy @xmath48 .",
    "an interesting phenomenon takes place in the opposite case , when @xmath49 .",
    "let us choose @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is critical value , which was obtained in eq.([mh/2 ] ) for the problem without the long range interaction . with this @xmath36",
    "the energy equals @xmath52 , where eq.([mh ] ) was used .",
    "thus the higgs exchange increases the binding energy of the system by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "correspondingly , the size of the system decreases by the same amount .",
    "we conclude that the higgs contribution proves to be very important even well before the higgs exchange alone would lead to the binding . for leptons bound by the coulomb attraction the higgs exchange produces @xmath54 30 times enhancement of the binding near the critical mass .      the variational approach may also be used to estimate contribution of other interaction terms . in particular , in the region of large separation between the quarks the effect of the confinement",
    "could become essential .",
    "note though that the region of large separations produces only small corrections to the energy . therefore with the sufficient accuracy we can approximate an influence of the confinement using the simple approximation , by applying the confining potential in its most transparent linear form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 gev@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we find then that the contribution to the energy equals @xmath58 . for @xmath59",
    "this contribution is by three orders of magnitude smaller than the effect produced by the pure gluon exchange , which equals @xmath60 .",
    "the weak interaction produces the short - range potential via the @xmath61-boson exchange , which with the sufficient for our purposes accuracy can be approximated as follows @xmath62 deriving this expression the low - energy , nonrelativistic scattering of the pair was considered in the unitary gauge . using the variational approach one finds that ( [ vz ] ) gives the following contribution to the energy @xmath63 for @xmath59 it is comparable to the contribution due to the photon exchange ( which can be approximated by the electrostatic interaction ) since the short - range suppression factor @xmath64 is close to 1 . hence the effect produced by the @xmath61-boson exchange is much smaller than the one originating from the higgs boson exchange .",
    "one of the consequences is that a bound state of heavy neutrinos ( from the hypothetical fourth generation ) may be formed only if @xmath65 gev , and this bound state would be almost entirely due to the higgs boson exchange .",
    "if mass of the particle is significantly smaller than @xmath2 the system is dominated by the long range interaction , i.e. @xmath67 , and the short - range higgs exchange is suppressed by the factor @xmath68 .",
    "the z - boson contribution has a similar suppression .",
    "a relatively accurate result in the area of @xmath3 may be obtained by using the expansion in powers of @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , near the minimum the energy @xmath70 is not sensitive to minor variations of @xmath36 , and it is sufficient to find an approximate value of @xmath36 .",
    "the error produced in this approximation of @xmath36 may be smaller than the error of the variational approach itself .",
    "keeping three leading terms in the @xmath71 expansion of the higgs contribution in eqs .",

    "@xmath76 the non - relativistic energy tends to @xmath77 however , the relativistic corrections ( @xmath78 ) become large in this limit since @xmath79 .",
    "for example , @xmath80 at @xmath81tev . in the following sections we will improve our results to account for this fact .",
    "it is convenient to combine together the relativistic corrections for the propagation of fermions and the retardation correction for the propagation of the intermediate higgs boson .",
    "we rely on the conventional technique , similar to the one applied for derivation of the breit corrections in qed .",
    "consider first the scattering process for the two fermions interacting through the higgs boson exchange , see the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , derive for this process the necessary relativistic and retardation corrections , and after that reformulate the result to make it applicable to the bound state problem .    the analytical expression for the amplitude of the scattering process illustrated by fig . [ fig1",
    "] can be written as the matrix element @xmath82 in which @xmath83 and @xmath84 are spinors that describe the incoming and outgoing fermions , while @xmath85 represents the higgs propagating in the intermediate state @xmath86 here @xmath87 , @xmath88 are the conventional dirac matrices for the two fermions , which arise due to the scalar nature of the fermion - higgs interaction ( our notation for spinors presumes that @xmath89 ) . considering the retardation as a correction we expanded the amplitude in powers of the transferred energy @xmath90 .",
    "this energy and the transferred momentum @xmath91 are related to the fermion energies and momenta @xmath92 , @xmath93 . as was mentioned , the term @xmath94 in eq.([int1 ] ) represents a correction that describes the retardation . neglecting in this correction the relativistic effects we can use in this term the approximation @xmath95 , @xmath88 .",
    "we also can apply the nonrelativistic approximation relating @xmath96 to the fermion momenta @xmath97 consequently we can rewrite ( [ int1 ] ) as follows @xmath98 here we use the center of mass reference frame , @xmath99 , which is natural for the bound state problem addresses below .    the second term in the brackets in eq.([int2 ] )",
    "is the contribution of the retardation to the relativistic correction .",
    "let us simplify now the main , first term in the brackets in eq.([int2 ] ) using the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "with the help of the foldy - wouthuysen transformation we can relate the four - spinors @xmath100 with the nonrelativistic two - spinors @xmath101 @xmath102 as a result we can use instead of the matrices @xmath103 the following expressions @xmath104 deriving after that @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the operator of spin of the fermion pair .    combining eqs.([int2]),([beta - expansion ] ) we find @xmath107 in order to apply this result to the bound state problem we identify here @xmath108 with an operator of the momentum @xmath109 and fulfill the fourier transformation over the transferred momentum @xmath91 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath110 , which appears as the result of this transformation , should be kept on the left side of the operator @xmath108 .",
    "this machinery is very similar to the one , which is conventionally applied for the derivation of the breit interaction in qed , see section 83 in @xcite . as a result after straightforward calculations we find the following potential , which includes all relativistic and retardation corrections for two fermions interacting via the higgs boson exchange @xmath111 where @xmath112 it is presumed here that the state possesses the orbital momentum @xmath113 and spin @xmath114 , and consequently the @xmath115-operator was transformed into expressions with @xmath116 .",
    "the first term @xmath117 in ( [ vr ] ) describes the conventional relativistic correction to the kinetic energy , while @xmath118 originates from @xmath119 .",
    "this term is written in a non - unitary form , which is similar to the way the breit correction is often presented in qed , though in both cases this fact produces no complications in the first order of the perturbation theory . however ,",
    "if necessity arises the potential can be amended to make the unitarity transparent , @xmath120 .",
    "note that the term @xmath121 vanishes for zero angular orbital momentum @xmath122 .",

    "note though that an attempt to fulfill the fourier transform over @xmath91 directly in eq.([v-4spinors ] ) should be treated with care since the matrix elements of @xmath129 matrices in ( [ v-4spinors ] ) effectively depend on @xmath91 .",
    "however , we will not dwell on this issue here since eqs.([v(q)]),([vr ] ) and ( [ v-4spinors ] ) constitute a reliable basis to treat the relativistic effects .      for the @xmath130 state , in which @xmath122 , the last term in eq.([vr ] ) is absent , @xmath131 .",
    "taking the variational wave function @xmath132 from ( [ psi ] ) we find the expectation value for the relativistic correction from eq.([wrel ] ) @xmath133 here the first and second terms in the brackets originate from the kinetic correction @xmath117 and the potential correction @xmath118 respectively .",

    "obviously this small correction should result in a small variation of the critical mass .",
    "let us find it , but first note that the considered relativistic correction represents only one of the different perturbations , which influence the critical mass .",
    "it is worth therefore to present an important simple formula for the shift of the critical mass in general case , for an arbitrary perturbation @xmath138 . within the variational approach the necessary equation reads @xmath139 here",
    "@xmath140 is the variational energy calculated without any corrections , while @xmath141 is the perturbation potential averaged over the variational wave function . to justify the first equality in eq.([dm ] ) one expands the condition for the critical mass @xmath142 over @xmath143 in the vicinity of the mass @xmath2 , which satisfies the nonperturbed critical condition @xmath144 . to prove the last identity in eq.([dm ] )",

    "we will see that the calculated in the next section radiative corrections reduce this mass shift by 30% , resulting in the following total mass shift @xmath153 gev .",
    "more accurate numerical results are mentioned below .",
    "the relativistic correction rapidly increases with mass @xmath1 . for large masses @xmath76 where @xmath154 approaches @xmath155 we obtain @xmath156 thus , the naive perturbative treatment of the relativistic corrections based on @xmath157 from eq .",
    "( [ wrel ] ) definitely fails for @xmath158 tev .",
    "moreover , the more accurate numerical treatment shows that this correction may be significant even at smaller masses .",
    "this perturbation has a positive sign , as can be picked up from the positive term @xmath159 in eq.([vr ] ) , which gives significant contribution ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "the repulsion produced by this correction may be so strong that it destabilises the bound state .",
    "there is though the way around this difficulty .",
    "it will be discussed below , in section [ perturbation theory ] in detail .",
    "speaking briefly , the idea is to allow the wave function the freedom to adjust itself in such a way that it is reduced at small separations @xmath161 , where the relativistic correction is dominant .",
    "this diminishing of @xmath162 reduces the relativistic correction and makes the perturbative approach sound , and the bound state stable .    to prepare ourselves for this treatment of the relativistic correction we need to simplify eq.([vr ] ) . with this purpose",
    "we , firstly , consider the most interesting for our discussion case of @xmath130-states , when the last term in this expression is absent , @xmath131 . secondly , take into account that the higgs mass is relatively small , @xmath163 .",
    "as a result , in the region of small separation between the two fermions @xmath164 the higgs mass is negligible . having this in mind",
    "we simplify the relativistic correction setting @xmath165 in the term @xmath166 , which gives ( [ vr ] ) for @xmath167 here the last identity takes into account that we consider @xmath130-states .",
    "hence we find that for @xmath168 eq.([vr ] ) gives @xmath169 to simplify notation the new parameter @xmath170 is introduced here ( compare the classical radius of a fermion in qed , @xmath171 ) . to simplify ( [ vrelddd ] )",
    "let us treat the sum of the first and second terms there as a perturbation .",
    "an inspiration comes from an identity @xmath172 which implies that if one neglects these two terms from ( [ vrelddd ] ) and then contemplates the perturbation theory over them , one can be certain that the first order of this perturbation is absent . neglecting the higher - order contribution of these terms ( see discussion at the end of this subsection ) we suppress these terms deriving from eq.([vrelddd ] ) @xmath173",
    "we can combine now this relativistic correction with the nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath174 from ( [ hh ] ) and write the corresponding eigenvalue problem @xmath175 . multiplying this differential equation by the factor",
    "@xmath176 we present the result as follows @xmath177 clearly eq.([sl ] ) can be considered as the eigenvalue problem of the sturm - liouville type .",
    "it has a very clear structure , but can be simplified further .",
    "take into consideration that for not too large @xmath1 , say @xmath178 tev , @xmath179 is expected to be smaller than the typical size of the bound state .",
    "hence we can use the simplification @xmath180 for the factor on the left - hand side of ( [ sl ] ) . for large separation @xmath181",
    "the validity of this approximation is obvious . in the opposite case of small distances @xmath182",
    "the term with @xmath43 is much smaller then the potential energy and can be ignored in the differential equation anyway .",
    "thus the replacement @xmath180 does not stir things up .",
    "we conclude that the wave function , which describes the binding of two heavy fermions satisfies the schrdinger - type eigenvalue problem @xmath183 , in which the hamiltonian @xmath184 accounts for the conventional nonrelativistic interaction and takes into account the relativistic and retardation corrections .    a notable simplicity and clear physical nature of this result make it attractive .",
    "the only distinction of ( [ rs ] ) from the nonrelativistic hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) lies in the factor @xmath179 , which effectively cuts the yukawa - type potential off at small distances . as a result at small distances there arises an effective repulsion , which is in line with the repulsive nature of the relativistic correction mentioned previously .",
    "it is worth to summarize the set of approximations employed for the derivation of ( [ rs ] ) .",
    "first , the higgs mass was neglected in the relativistic term .",
    "second , the approximation @xmath180 on the left - hand side of ( [ sl ] ) was used .",
    "both these approximations are justified by the parameters of the problem .",
    "third , the sum of the first two terms in eq.([vrelddd ] ) was neglected .",
    "we can see now the qualitative reason , which makes this approximation sound .",
    "the perturbation theory over these two terms starts from only the second order , as ( [ delta - psi ] ) shows .",
    "meanwhile the repulsion at small separations caused by the relativistic correction is well accounted for in the hamiltonian @xmath185 .",
    "this repulsion reduces the wave function at small distances and hence suppresses the impact of the omitted terms in the problem .",
    "consequently , their contribution is to be suppressed .",
    "this implies , in particular that the sign of the correction to ( [ rs ] ) is defined by the second order perturbation theory ( over the omitted in ( [ vrelddd ] ) terms ) , and hence is definitely negative .",
    "to calculate the radiative corrections we use the conventional method which originally was developed to calculate the lamb shift in atoms - see e.g. @xcite . for the problem at hand",
    "the necessary corrections were calculated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that the most important contribution give two diagrams , shown in fig .",
    "one describes the higgs polarization operator produced by the fermion loop , another the vertex correction to the higgs - fermion interaction .",
    "note that the diagram with the virtual fermion annihilation does not contribute to the energy shift for the non - relativistic fermions since the annihilation vertex of the fermion and anti - fermion into the higgs vanishes for @xmath186 .",
    "the reason is that the higgs is a scalar .",
    "this is in contrast to a similar annihilation processes with the virtual annihilation of the positronium into photon , vector particle , which gives a nonzero contribution in qed @xcite .",
    "we also neglect the diagram with crossed higgs legs in the two - higgs exchange since it is not enhanced by a large number of different fermions ( @xmath187 ) in the loop ( compare with the polarization operator eq .",

    "however , their absolute discrepancy remains approximately constant .",
    "thirdly , it is interesting that the shift of the binding energy produced by the gluon exchange greatly exceeds the typical binding energy observed when the higgs exchange is neglected . in the latter case",
    "one can roughly estimate the spread of binding energies due to the gluon exchange alone in the coulomb - type model @xmath282 .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that this energy is much smaller than the shift of the binding energy when the gluon exchange is added to the higgs exchange .",
    "there is a clear physical reason behind this phenomenon .",
    "the gluon exchange alone keeps two quarks at a typical separation that is comparable with the effective coulomb radius .",

    "the higgs exchange alone is not able to produce the bound state , but when combined with the gluon exchange it increases the binding energy significantly .",
    "for a wide range of fermion masses discussed in the data presented in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig7 ] both the fermion mass and typical momenta of quarks in the bound state exceed the higgs mass .",

    "[ fig7 ] . in the simplest approximation we can therefore safely neglect these corrections . making these simplifications in eq.([eimproved ] ) we find a clear analytical expression for the energy @xmath284 remember that the second and third terms here originate from the yukawa - type interaction ( [ vh ] ) and relativistic correction ( [ vr ] ) correspondingly . to present the argument in the most clear form we neglected in eq.([eanalytmin ] ) the potential , which stems from the gluon exchange .",
    "( the way to account it is discussed at the end of this subsection ) .",

    "[ fig8 ] shows the energy from eq.([coulomb ] ) , which neglects the relativistic correction .    from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we see again , this time basing the argument on clear analytical results , that the relativistic correction is important ; it substantially reduces the binding energy of the two fermions . as a result",
    "the system remains in the nonrelativistic state for much larger masses , then one could have anticipated . to illustrate this point",
    "let us find the value of @xmath1 , at which the the energy in ( [ eanalytmin ] ) equals the fermion mass .",

    "the just presented arguments make it tempting to contemplate the possibility that the theory presented remains valid for masses beyond the @xmath298 tev limit , but in order to support this claim one should apply more sophisticated methods , possibly the bethe - salpeter equation , than the ones developed in the present work .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows that the dependence of the binding energy on @xmath17 is sizable , but still can be considered as a perturbations .",

    "we find that they are positive and significantly reduce the binding energy .",
    "however , their influence on the critical mass @xmath305 for the fermion binding proves to be insignificant .",
    "the radiative corrections are found to play a minor role for all the interval of energies studied , at least up to @xmath272 tev . in the case of heavy charged leptons",
    "the higgs exchange dramatically increases the binding energy when mass @xmath1 approaches @xmath305 .",
    "a very significant increase also happens for quarks when @xmath306 .",
    "the shift of energy , which is produced by the gluon exchange in the system bound mostly due to the higgs exchange , exceeds greatly the scale of energies typical to the systems bound due to the gluon exchange alone .",
    "the higgs exchange also strongly increases the bound fermion density @xmath307 and consequently the creation and annihilation widths for the bound state .",
    "the widths calculation will be performed in a separate publication . however , there is no fundamental reason , which would make impossible the detection of the bound states considered at lhc if the heavy fermions do exist .",
    "note that we did not calculate the splitting of the spin @xmath308 and @xmath309 bound states .",
    "the relative value of this splitting @xmath310 should be significantly smaller then the leading relativistic corrections since it does not appear in the order @xmath6 in the higgs exchange interaction , which is in difference with systems bound via the interactions produces by photon and gluon exchanges .",
