    "this paper gives a complete description of the solutions of the one dimensional ginzburg - landau equations which model superconductivity phenomena in infinite slabs .",
    "one of our main goals here is to determine the number , symmetry and stability of solutions .",
    "we give a complete numerical investigation of these issues over the entire range of physically important parameters : @xmath0 the size of the slab , @xmath1 the ginzburg - landau parameter , and @xmath2 , the exterior magnetic field .",
    "our experiments , which are summarized in figure [ figsummary ] , reveal the existence of two key - points in parameter space which play a central role in the way superconductivity is nucleated . indeed , according to the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", superconductivity appears either in the volume of the sample if the slab is thin , or on superconducting sheaths near the boundary if the slab is large , and in the form of two - dimensionnal vortex patterns if the slab is of intermediate size .",
    "this is why all values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are of interest .",
    "as we shall see , sheaths and vortices can be described in terms of asymmetric solutions of the one dimensional problem , and each of the key - points gives rise to diverse pattern formation by means of various bifurcation phenomena .",
    "in addition , our results provide new insight into the problem of differentiating between the types of superconductors in terms of the parameters .",
    "finally , our global description allows us to understand better many interesting physical phenomena , to classify results previously obtained for each regime of the parameters and also to derive new open problems . in order to properly describe our results we begin with a brief summary of the model .",
    "the superconductivity of certain metals is characterized at very low temperatures by the loss of electrical resistance and the expulsion of the exterior magnetic field @xmath3 . in the model derived by ginzburg and landau in 1950 ( see @xcite ) , the electromagnetic properties of the material are completely described by the magnetic potential vector @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the magnetic field ) and the complex - valued order parameter @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , @xmath6 is an averaged wave function of the superconducting electrons and its modulus corresponds to the density of superconducting carriers . when the sample is wholly normal , @xmath7 and the magnetic field inside the material @xmath8 is equal to the exterior magnetic field @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the sample is perfectly superconducting , @xmath9 and the magnetic field @xmath8 is identically 0 .",
    "furthermore , in the ginzburg - landau theory , the state of the sample is completely determined by the minimum of an energy depending on @xmath6 and @xmath4 . for a more precise description of the general theory",
    ", one may refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or to @xcite , @xcite .    in the special case when the sample is an infinite slab of constant thickness , between the planes @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ", it is usual to assume that both @xmath6 and * a * are uniform in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions , and that the exterior magnetic field is tangential to the slab , that is @xmath14(0,0,@xmath2 ) .",
    "a suitable gauge can then be chosen so that @xmath15 is a real function , and @xmath16 , where * e*@xmath17 is the unit vector along the @xmath12 direction ( see @xcite for more details ) . in this case , the nondimensionalized form of the ginzburg - landau energy is given by : [ ekappa ] e_(f , q)=_-a^a ( 1 f^2+f^2q^2 + 12f^4-f^2+(q- h_0)^2 )  dx .",
    "the nondimensionalized parameter @xmath1 is called the ginzburg - landau parameter .",
    "it is the ratio of @xmath18 , the penetration depth of the magnetic field , to @xmath19 , the coherence length , which is the characteristic length of variation of @xmath20 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 determines the type of superconductor according to the type of phase transition which takes place between the normal phase and the superconducting phase : @xmath1 small describes what is known as a type i superconductor and @xmath1 large as a type ii .",
    "more precisely ,",
    "for a type i superconductor , there is a critical magnetic field @xmath21 such that if @xmath22 , the material is entirely superconducting and the magnetic field is expelled from the sample apart from a boundary layer of size @xmath18 .",
    "this is called the meissner effect . if @xmath23 , superconductivity is destroyed and the material is in the normal state , that is @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for a type ii superconductor ,",
    "the phase transition is different and there are two critical fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 : for @xmath28 , the exterior magnetic field is expelled from the sample and there is a meissner effect as for type i superconductors . but",
    "as @xmath2 is increased above @xmath26 , superconductivity is not destroyed straight away , since the superconducting and the normal phase coexist under the form of filaments or vortices : the vortex is a zone of diameter @xmath19 , at the center of which the order parameter @xmath20 vanishes .",
    "as @xmath2 increases further , the vortices become more numerous until the critical value @xmath27 is reached at which superconductivity is destroyed . for @xmath29 , there is no superconductivity and the material is in the normal state .",
    "the way superconductivity is nucleated is highly dependent on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as we will see later in section 4 , where we will introduce a third critical field @xmath30 corresponding to nucleation of surface superconductivity .",
    "we refer to tinkham @xcite for a detailed explanation .",
    "the vortex phenomena in superconductivity have been widely studied in the literature .",
    "see for instance @xcite or @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the critical value of @xmath1 usually given to separate type i and type ii superconductors is @xmath31 . in the next sections",
    ", we will describe how this value is computed in the limiting case @xmath32 .",
    "however , as @xmath0 is decreased from infinity , we will see that the demarcation between type i and ii behaviours is no longer the constant @xmath33 .",
    "instead , we find that there is a well defined curve in the @xmath34 plane which separates the two types of behaviours .",
    "this result will be fully discussed in section 3 . similarly in section 4 , we find an extra curve which separates different type i superconductors according to surface effects .    for a mathematical analysis of the problem ,",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it then follows from standard variational arguments that there exists a minimizer of @xmath37 , and that the minimizer is a solution of @xmath38 notice that @xmath24 and @xmath39 is always a solution for any real @xmath40 . from now on",
    ", we will call this a _ normal solution_. regularity properties of minimizers yield that either @xmath20 is a normal solution , or @xmath20 does not change sign , hence we will study the case @xmath41 .",
    "an easy calculation shows that the energy @xmath37 is zero along the normal solution .",
    "thus a global minimizer can not have positive energy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a complete description ( number , symmetry and stability ) of the solutions of the system @xmath42 for which @xmath41 on @xmath43 $ ] , according to the values of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this work is based on numerical simulations obtained with auto , a software developed by doedel et al .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which computes bifurcation diagrams for systems of ode s .    in order to properly describe our results ,",
    "it is necessary that we first give a brief summary of previous studies of the @xmath42 system .",
    "this is done in the next section .",
    "then , in sections 3 and 4 we give the details of our numerical investigation for symmetric solutions ( section 3 ) and asymmetric solutions ( section 4 ) , together with their physical implications and suggestions for future research .",

    "he explained the type of behaviour described by figure [ figs2 ] in terms of superheating and supercooling .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath2 is large , superconductivity does not occur and the material is in the normal state .",
    "as @xmath2 is decreased , the material stays in the normal state down to @xmath79 , even though there is a range of @xmath2 where the normal solution is only a local minimizer and the global minimizer is a superconducting solution ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is decreased further , there is a jump in the maximum of @xmath20 and the material becomes superconducting , the solution being given by the symmetric branch . in this case , @xmath79 is called the supercooling field .",
    "now , on the contrary , start from @xmath114 where the superconducting state @xmath115 is the global minimizer and increase @xmath2 .",
    "the material will remain superconducting until @xmath87 is reached , though for fields slightly less then @xmath87 , it is only a local minimizer and the global minimizer is the normal solution . for @xmath2 above @xmath87 , there is a jump in the maximum of @xmath20 and the material reverts to the normal state .",
    "this is the superheating phenomenon .",
    "these two phenomena give rise to a hysteresis loop as described in @xcite or later in @xcite .",
    "we will make further remarks about these stability properties in section 5 .",
    "ginzburg and landau @xcite had also noticed that if @xmath0 large is fixed , then there occurs a symmetric supercritical bifurcation of superconducting solutions from the normal state as @xmath1 is increased through a critical value , but had no special explanation for this , since at that time only superconductors with small @xmath1 were known .",
    "however , as we shall see in the next section , as @xmath1 is increased through this critical value , our studies indicate that the behaviour seen in figure [ figs2 ] changes into that seen in figure [ figs3 ] .",
    "chapman @xcite has studied the case @xmath32 , and showed that there is a change of bifurcation from subcritical to supercritical that takes place for @xmath31 , which is the critical value between type i and ii superconductors .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , a linear stability analysis through the time dependent equations yield that the value @xmath31 is also the one for which stability of the normal solution switches . in @xcite",
    ", he has investigated the behaviour of the superheating field @xmath87 in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "following these works which are mainly based on formal computations , bolley and helffer have extensively studied the phenomenon of bifurcation of solutions from the normal solution in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , they have given rigorous proofs of properties of bifurcating branches and asymptotic formula for the superheating and supercooling fields .",
    "although their results are mainly local , they have made a first attempt in @xcite to give a global stability picture of the solutions .",
    "we will mention the details of their contributions relevant to the values of the parameters in the course of the discussion , and indicate how their results contribute to the broader global picture .",
    "recently , hastings , kwong and troy @xcite have further investigated the multiplicity of symmetric solutions .",
    "they have proved that if @xmath116 , and @xmath0 is sufficiently large , then the behaviour of @xmath80 is described by figure [ figs2 ] , and if @xmath117 and @xmath0 sufficiently large , by figure [ figs3 ] .",
    "seydel @xcite @xcite was the first to give numerical evidence that there is a range of parameters for which asymmetric solutions and multiple symmetric solutions coexist .",
    "one of the major goals of this paper is to extend the results described above and completely determine the multiplicity and stability of symmetric and asymmetric solutions for the entire range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in the next two sections , we present the detail of our numerical investigations for symmetric solutions ( section 3 ) and asymmetric solutions ( section 4 ) , together with their physical implications and suggestions for future research . in particular in section 4 , we explain how asymmetric solutions of @xmath42 give rise to nucleation of sheaths and vortices .",
