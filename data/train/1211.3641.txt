    "other examples are the significant differences ( branching ) in the relations ( a ) of the radiance e(caiik ) vs e(caii8542 ) found by landman and illing ( 1977 ) ; ( b ) of the radiance e(caiik , h ) vs @xmath3 ) found by stellmacher ( 1978 ) ; and ( c ) of the central line intensity @xmath4(caiik ) vs @xmath4(h@xmath5 ) found by engvold ( 1978 ) .",
    "the branching in the caiih&k radiance is accompanied by a concomitant variation of the widths of the balmer lines relative to those of the caiih&k lines ( stellmacher 1979 ) .",
    "it has been conjectured whether magnetic field coupling may produce selective non - thermal broadening of the ca ions .",
    "however , such an effect was not found in the analysis by landman et al .",

    "h@xmath5 slit - jaw images were taken for each set of spectra on kodak so-392 film .",
    "a slit width of @xmath11 was used , corresponding to a spatial resolution of 1.24arcsec .    for the photometric calibration of the spectra we placed a wedge in front of the entrance slit , illuminated by a ( de - focused ) quiet region at disk - center .",
    "the absolute prominence emission was deduced from disk - center spectra calibrated with the reference continua given by labs and neckel ( 1968 ) . for the k - line we used the value of 0.82 given by white and suemoto ( 1968 ) for @xmath12 relative to an assumed continuum window at @xmath13 .",

    "two examples of a complete set of emission spectra are shown in figure1 .",
    "if we suppose that for optically thin prominence emissions , the thermal and non - thermal line broadening constitute the only significant mechanism , we may deduce mean values of the kinetic temperature , @xmath14 , and the non - thermal broadening , @xmath15 from the observed line profiles : those from atoms of small mass ( e.g. h@xmath0 with @xmath16 ) depend mostly on @xmath14 , while those from atoms with large mass ( e.g. ca with @xmath17 ) are dominated by non - thermal broadening .    in figure2",

    "these well agree with those by hirayama ( 1978 ) , who obtained 4500k@xmath26k and 3km / s@xmath27km / s .",
    "similar values were also deduced by landman et al .",
    "( 1977 ) from their analysis of the widths of h@xmath0 , hed@xmath28 and caiiir .",
    "a corresponding plot for the observed widths of h@xmath0 and caiik ( figure3 ) shows stronger deviations from the calculated curve in the sense of additional broadening of the caiik lines .",
    "this may be due to self - absorption , but also to unresolved macro - shifts , visible in some doppler - shifted emission ejecta ( see also engvold and malville , 1977 ) .",
    "the emission relations of caiih , k and h@xmath5 , h@xmath0 show a branching that depends on the widths of the caii lines ( stellmacher 1979 ) .",
    "the non - thermal broadening , @xmath15 , widens the profiles and reduces their central intensity , @xmath4 ; the integrated intensity @xmath29 ( line radiance ) remains unchanged , except for the optically thick case .    for an optically thin line with pure gaussian profile it is @xmath30 .",
    "the relation of observed @xmath4 and @xmath31 shows for h@xmath0 ( fig.4 ) a smaller scatter than for caiiir ( fig.5 ) .",
    "this reflects the strong dependence of the latter on the non - thermal broadening , @xmath15 , which varies by more than a factor of three ( cf . , figure2 ) , whereas h@xmath0 depends mostly on the ( much less varying ) @xmath14 .",
    "the tight relation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( figure4 ) allows one to use @xmath32 as a measure for the total thickness of the prominence ( i.e. its number - density ) .",

    "inserted into formula1 these give @xmath35k and @xmath36km / s .",
    "we note that for caiiir our relation @xmath4 versus @xmath31 well agrees with the one given landman ( 1979 ) .",
    "the bending in the observed relation @xmath4 vs e ( fig.4 ) shows that saturation becomes effective for the h@xmath0 emission . for an estimate of the h@xmath0 optical thickness",
    ", we use the h@xmath5 optical thickness , @xmath37 , which stellmacher ( 1969 ) gives for @xmath38 erg/(s@xmath7ster ) . with @xmath39",
    ", we deduce a corresponding h@xmath0 optical thickness of @xmath40 . based on this value",
    ", we can now determine for @xmath41 a mean h@xmath0 radiance @xmath42 erg/(s@xmath7ster ) .",

    "the widths of the seven broadest h@xmath0 lines in figure4 with @xmath43 erg/(s@xmath7ster ) , where saturation becomes important , are encircled in figure2 .",
    "figure6 shows the central intensity @xmath4 of the observed caiik line versus that of the corresponding h@xmath0 line , ( the latter giving the total prominence thickness as argued above ) .",
    "the observed relation can be separated into two distinct branches defined by the ratio of their reduced doppler width @xmath44 from figure3 .",
    "the upper branch ( full dots in fig.6 ) contains data with @xmath45 , which are characteristic for narrow caiik profiles ( @xmath46 in fig.3 ) . the lower branch ( open circles in fig.6 ) contains data with @xmath47 , which are characteristic for broad the caiik profiles in figure3 .",
    "hence , the difference in the central caiik intensity for a given @xmath32 reflects their strong sensitivity to non - thermal broadening .",
    "a similar relation , but for the observed caiiir and h@xmath0 line is shown in figure7 . here",
    ", the branching is much less pronounced . for optical thin layers with central intensities",
    "@xmath48 erg/(s@xmath7ster ) in figure7 , we find a slight indication that narrow caiiir profiles with @xmath49 ( cf . , fig.2 ) tend to follow the upper part of the relation ( full dots in figure7 ) .",
    "we confirm that the branching in the caii versus balmer emission correlates with the non - thermal line broadening , @xmath15 .",
    "the importance of that parameter for the transfer problem of the caii lines was discussed by heasley and milkey ( 1978 ) .",
    "comparison of their calculated relation e(caiik ) vs e(caiih ) with observations by landman and illing ( 1977 ) gave small values @xmath50km",
    "stellmacher ( 1979 ) obtained @xmath51km / s , being compatible with values he obtained from higher balmer lines and hed@xmath28 .    the line - width method ( through equation ( 1 ) )",
    "may be reliable , if the widths of the hydrogen , helium and metal lines give single values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , the time variation of the prominence structure ( threads ) suggests that _ large scale motions may affect a line broadening in addition to the thermal and non - thermal velocities_.    corresponding calculations have been carried out by kawaguchi ( 1966 ) for the balmer line profiles .",
    "he assumed different laws for the distribution of the thread velocities ( independent of the position along the line of sight ) and constant thermal and non - thermal ( maxwellian ) broadening within each optically thin thread .",
    "he obtained ( apart from a gaussian distribution law , which again results in gaussian profiles ) non - gaussian shapes for the additional line broadening .",
    "hence , _ the structure of the prominence itself influences the line width and the total emission by convolution of the internal maxwellian broadening with the ( macro- ) velocity distribution function of threads along the line of sight_. side - on and edge - on observations of prominences may then be spectroscopically distinct ; a possible example was discussed by landman and illing ( 1977 ) in context with the branching of their caiik versus caiiir emission relation .",
    "similarly , differences in e(caiik)/e(h@xmath5 ) ratio found by engvold et al .",
    "( 1978 ) between ordinary prominence structures and edge structures with ejecta may be related to such a modified line broadening ."
