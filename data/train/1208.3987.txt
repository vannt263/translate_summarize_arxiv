    "rare decays which proceed via flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are induced by one - loop diagrams in the standard model ( sm ) and are excellent probes for new physics ( np ) .",
    "new particles can enter in competing loop - order diagrams , resulting in large deviations from sm predictions .",
    "in general , an effective hamiltonian formalism is used to describe the amplitudes of fcnc processes , according to the formula : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the relevant factors of the ckm matrix ; @xmath6 are local operators ; @xmath7 are the corresponding couplings ( wilson coefficients ) ; and @xmath8 is the qcd renormalization scale . the information on heavy degrees of freedom is embedded in the wilson coefficients , which are , in general , different for the sm and np models .",
    "moreover , the correlation of different channels , where different combinations of wilson coefficients contribute , is a powerful tool for searching and understanding the structure of np .",
    "this approach is complementary to the direct search for np at general purpose detectors . at current experiments ,",
    "precision measurements of flavour physics allow energy scales as high as 200 tev  @xcite to be tested , which exceed the reach for direct production by about two orders of magnitude . in this",
    "paper recent measurements of the decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the implication for the search for physics beyond the sm will be discussed .",
    "the decays @xmath12 are suppressed in the sm , being fcnc and helicity suppressed .",
    "their branching fractions are predicted to be : @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the sm  @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasising that while the theory predictions refer to branching fractions at @xmath15 , experiments measure time integrated branching fractions .",
    "this implies that the effective measured branching fraction for @xmath16 is about 10% larger than predictions  @xcite .",
    "the correction due to soft photons , which are not detected experimentally , is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general these branching fractions are given by the following formula : @xmath17    where @xmath18 is an electroweak axial - vector wilson coefficient and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are scalar and pseudo - scalar coefficients .",
    "in the sm the ( pseudo)-scalar operators are negligibly small , but this is not generally the case in np models .",
    "for instance in models with an extended higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm these branching fractions are proportional to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the two higgs doublets .",
    "constraints on these branching fractions have been set by the experiments d0  @xcite , cdf  @xcite , atlas  @xcite , cms  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite .",

    "this quantity was measured at lhcb by combining measurements with semi - leptonic and hadronic decays  @xcite to be @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on this parameter is , in the long run , one of the dominant systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the branching fraction of the decay @xmath38 , thereby limiting the discriminating power between sm and np contributions in this decay . knowledge of @xmath39 is also necessary for the measurement of the ratio @xmath40 , which is affected by small theoretical uncertainties and is a test of minimal flavour violation  @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the branching fractions of the decay @xmath41 and @xmath42 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : straubbsmumu ] for several scenarios of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the recent limits set by lhcb on these decays exclude large fraction of the parameter space in a whole range of new models .",
    "large scalar effective couplings are no longer considered a probable scenario for np .",
    "however , it is also possible that np and sm contributions interfere destructively , decreasing the @xmath43 branching fractions .",

    "in the decay @xmath47 several angular observables , which are sensitive to physics beyond the sm , can be constructed .",

    "these observables include the forward - backward asymmetry of the dimuon system , @xmath48 , the fraction of @xmath49 longitudinal polarization , @xmath50 , the transverse asymmetry , @xmath51  @xcite ( often referred to as @xmath52 in the literature  @xcite ) , and the cp averaged quantity @xmath53",
    "@xcite , proportional to the imaginary component of the product of the transverse and longitudinal amplitude of the @xmath54 .",
    "+ these observables can be extracted by performing an angular analysis as a function of the dimuon invariant mass squared , @xmath55 , with respect to the following angles : the angle @xmath56 between the @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) in the dimuon rest frame ; the angle @xmath61 between the kaon and @xmath59 in the @xmath62 rest frame ; and the angle @xmath63 between the planes of the dimuon system and the plane of the @xmath62 .",
    "a formal definition of these angles can be found in ref .",
    "it should be noticed that the definition of the angles varies in the literature . in particular , the sign of the @xmath63 angle in lhcb is opposite to that of cdf for the @xmath64 decay , while it is the same for the @xmath59 decay .",
    "consequently , in place of @xmath65  @xcite the angular distribution measured at lhcb is sensitive to the cp - average @xmath53 , whereas cdf is sensitive to the cp asymmetry @xmath66  @xcite .",
