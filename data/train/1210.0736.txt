    "for decades computer hardware has grown in power approximately according to moore s law , which states that the computer power doubles for constant cost roughly once every two years . however , because of the fundamental difficulties of size in conventional computer technology , this dream run is ending .",
    "the conventional approaches to the fabrication of computer technology are to make electronic devices smaller and smaller in order to increase the computer power .",
    "as the sizes of the electronic devices get close to the atomic scale , quantum effects are starting to interfere in their functioning , and thus the conventional approaches run up against the size limit .",
    "one possible way to get around the difficulties is to move to a new computing paradigm provided by quantum information science .",
    "quantum information science is based on the idea of using quantum devices to perform computation and manipulate and transmit information , instead of electronic devices following the laws of classical physics , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics and information theory are two of the great scientific developments and technological revolutions in the 20th century , and quantum information science is to marry the two previously disparate fields and form a single unifying viewpoint . quantum information science studies the preparation and control of the quantum states of physical systems for the purposes of information transmission and manipulation .",
    "it includes quantum computation , quantum communication and quantum cryptography .",
    "this revolutionary field will enable a range of exotic new devices to be possible .",
    "there is now a general agreement that quantum information science will likely lead to the creation of a  quantum computer to solve problems that could not be efficiently solved on a classical computer .",
    "already scientists have built rudimentary quantum computers in the research laboratory to run quantum algorithms and perform certain calculations .",
    "intensive research efforts are under way around the world to investigate a number of technologies that could lead to more powerful and more prevalent quantum computers in the near future .",
    "it is believed that quantum information and quantum bits are to lead to a 21st century technological revolution much as classic information and classic bits did to the 20th century . since the theory of quantum mechanics is fundamentally stochastic , randomness and uncertainty",
    "are deeply rooted in quantum computation and quantum information . as a result ,",
    "quantum algorithms are of random nature in the sense that they yield correct solutions only with some probabilities , and monte carlo methods are widely employed in quantum simulation .",
    "thus statistics has an important role to play in quantum computation , quantum simulation and quantum information .",
    "on the other hand , quantum computation and quantum simulation have tremendous potential to revolutionize computational statistics .",
    "a quantum system is generally described by its state , and the state is mathematically defined to be a unit vector in some complex hilbert space .",
    "the number of complex numbers required to characterize the quantum state usually grows exponentially with the size of the system , rather than linearly , as occurs in classical systems . as a consequence",
    ", it takes an exponential number of bits of memory on a classical computer to store the quantum state , which puts classical computers in a difficult position to simulate a quantum system . on the other hand ,",
    "nature quantum systems are able to store and keep track of an exponential of complex numbers and perform data manipulations and calculations as the systems evolve .",
    "quantum information science is to grapple with understanding how to take advantage of the enormous information hidden in the quantum systems and to harness the immense potential computational power of atoms and molecules for the purpose of performing computation and processing information .",
    "already it has been shown that quantum algorithms like grover s search algorithm and shor s factoring algorithm provide great advantage over known classical algorithms .",
    "contemporary scientific studies often rely on understanding complex quantum systems , such as those in biochemistry and nanotechnology for the design of biomolecules and nano - materials .",
    "quantum simulation is to use computers to simulate a quantum system and its time evolution .",
    "classical computers are being used for quantum simulation in designing novel molecules and creating innovative nano - products .",
    "quantum computers built upon quantum systems may excel in simulating naturally occurring quantum systems , while large quantum systems may be impossible to simulate in an efficient manner by classical computers .",
    "a  quantum system with @xmath0 distinct components may be described with @xmath0 quantum bits in a quantum computer , while a classical computer requires @xmath1 bits of memory to store its quantum state .",
    "this advantage allows quantum computers to efficiently simulate general quantum systems that are not efficiently simulatable on classical computers .    in this article",
    "we review the concepts of quantum computation and introduce quantum algorithms and quantum simulation .",
    "the quantum algorithms are known to be much faster than the available classical algorithms .",
    "statistical analyses of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation are provided .",
    "we give a brief description on quantum information .",
    "the article sections start with presentations in broad brushstrokes , followed by specific discussions along with some mathematical derivations if necessary .",
    "the intention is to give each topic first an overview and then a general description and a precise characterization .",
    "it is recommended to focus on the qualitative discussions but skip the derivations for the readers who would like to get a quick picture of quantum computation and quantum simulation .    the rest of the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] briefly introduces quantum mechanics , quantum probability and quantum statistics .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] reviews basic concepts of quantum computation and entanglement .",

    "section  [ sec7 ] features concluding remarks and lists some open research problems .",
    "quantum mechanics has been applied to everything under and inside the sun , from chemical reaction and superconductor to the structure of dna and nuclear fusion in stars . although the significant difference between classical physics and quantum physics lies in the quantum prediction of physical entity when the scale of observations becomes comparable to the atomic or sub - atomic scale , many macroscopic properties of systems can only be fully explained and understood by quantum physics .",
    "the quantum world is extremely strange , and quantum theory is completely counterintuitive .",
    "light waves behave like particles and particles behave like waves ( wave particle duality ) ; matter can go from one spot to another without moving through the intermediate space ( quantum tunneling ) ; information can be moved across a vast distance without transmitting it through the intervening space ( quantum teleportation ) .",
    "quantum theory provides a mathematical description of wave particle duality and interaction of matter and energy .",
    "it describes the time evolutions of physical systems via wave functions .",
    "the wave functions encapsulate the probabilities that particles are to be found in a given state at a given time .",
    "for example , the probability of finding a photon in some region is the square of the modulus of a wave function , and , since at some point the sum of two wave functions can be zero but neither wave function is zero , probabilities appear to cancel out each other in a way totally unexpected from classical probability .",
    "the intrinsic stochastic nature of quantum theory indicates a deep connection between quantum mechanics and probability .",
    "since the main focus of this paper is on quantum computation and quantum information , we give a  brief description of quantum theory in this section to provide some quantum background for the purpose of reviewing quantum computation and quantum simulation in subsequent sections .",

    "physical entities like position and momentum can be measured precisely , the theory of quantum mechanics is intrinsically stochastic in a sense that we can only make probabilistic prediction about the results of the measurements performed.=-1 quantum mechanics is mathematically described by a hilbert space @xmath45 and self - adjoint operators on  @xmath45 .",

    "considerquantum error - correction for reliable quantum computation and quantum information processing .",
    "quantum error - correction is employed in quantum computation and quantum communication to protect quantum information from loss due to quantum noise and other errors like faulty quantum gates .",
    "classical information uses redundancy to achieve error - correction , but the no - cloning theorem presents an obstacle to copying quantum information and formulating a theory of quantum error - correction based on simple redundancy .",
    "again quantum entanglement comes to the rescue .",
    "it is forbidden to copy qubits but we can spread the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of several qubits . @xcite first discovered the method of formulating a quantum error - correction code by storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of nine qubits . over time",
    "several quantum error - correction codes are proposed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; steane , @xcite ) .",
    "these quantum error - correction codes can protect quantum information against quantum noise , and thus quantum noise likely poses no fundamental barrier to the performance of large - scale quantum computing and quantum information processing .    here",
    "is how quantum error - correction codes work .",
    "we consider the single qubit case .",
    "first assume that a qubit @xmath408 is passed through a bit flip channel which flips the state of a qubit from @xmath94 to @xmath95 and from @xmath95 to @xmath94 , each with probability @xmath409 , and leaves each of states @xmath94 and @xmath95 untouched with probability @xmath410 .",
    "we describe a bit flip code that protects the qubit against quantum noise from the bit flip channel .",
    "we encode states @xmath94 and @xmath95 in three qubits , with @xmath94 encoded as @xmath411 and @xmath95 as @xmath412 .",
    "thus the qubit state @xmath408 is encoded in three qubits as @xmath413 .",
    "we pass each of the three qubits through an independent copy of the bit flip channel , and assume that at most one qubit is flipped .",
    "the following simple two - step error - correction procedure can be used to recover the correct quantum state.=1    step 1 .",
    "perform a measurement on a specially constructed observable and call the measurement result an error syndrome .",
    "the error syndrome can inform us what error , if any , occurred on the quantum state",
    ". the observable has eigenvalues @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath150 and @xmath414 , with corresponding projection operators , @xmath415 if one of three qubits has one or no bit flip , the error syndrome will be one of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath150 and @xmath414 , with @xmath92 corresponding to no flip , and @xmath93 , @xmath150 and @xmath414 to a bit flip on the first , second and third qubit , respectively .",
    "for example , if the first qubit is flipped , the corrupted state is @xmath416 . since @xmath417 and @xmath418 for @xmath419 ,",
    "in this case the error syndrome is @xmath93 .",
    "although performing measurements usually causes change to the quantum state , the speciality of the constructed observable is that syndrome measurement does not perturb the quantum state : it is easy to check that the state is @xmath60 both before and after the syndrome measurement .",
    "while the syndrome provides information about what flip error has occurred , it does not contain any information about the state being protected , that is , it does not allow us to deduce anything about the amplitudes @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "such a special property is the generic feature of syndrome measurement .",
    "the error type supplied by the error syndrome can inform us what procedure to use to recover the original state .",
    "for example , error syndrome @xmath93 indicates a bit flip on the first qubit , and a flip on the first qubit again will perfectly recover the original state @xmath413 .",
    "the error syndrome @xmath92 implies no error and doing nothing , and error syndromes @xmath93 , @xmath150 and @xmath414 correspond to a bit flip again on the first , second , third qubit , respectively .",
    "the procedure will recover the original state with perfect accuracy , if there is at most one bit flip in the encoded three qubits .",
    "the probability that more than one bit flipped is @xmath420 , which is much smaller than the error probability @xmath409 of making no - correction for the typical bit flip channel . thus the encoding and decoding scheme makes the storage and transmission of the qubit more reliable.=1    next we consider a more interesting noisy quantum channel : a phase flip channel which , with probability @xmath409 , changes a qubit state @xmath408 to @xmath421 , and with probability @xmath410 , leaves alone the qubit .",
    "the following scheme is to turn the phase flip channel into a bit flip channel .",
    "let @xmath422 and @xmath423 be a qubit basis .",
    "the phase flip channel leaves alone states @xmath424 and @xmath425 with probability @xmath410 and changes @xmath424 to @xmath425 and vice versa with probability @xmath409 . in other words ,",
    "the phase flip channel with respect to the basis @xmath424 and @xmath425 acts just like a bit flip channel with respect to the basis @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus we encode @xmath94 as @xmath426 and @xmath95 as @xmath427 for protection against phase flip errors . the operations for encoding , error - detection and recovery are the same as for the bit flip channel but with respect to the @xmath424 and @xmath425 basis instead of the @xmath94 and @xmath95 basis .",
    "last we describe shor error - correction code .",
    "it is a combination of the three - qubit phase flip and bit flip codes .",
    "first use the phase flip code to encode states @xmath94 and @xmath95 in three qubits , with @xmath94 encoded as @xmath426 and @xmath95 as @xmath427 ; next , use the three - qubit bit flip code to encode each of these qubits , with @xmath424 encoded as @xmath428 and @xmath425 encoded as @xmath429 .",
    "the resulted nine - qubit code has codeworks as follows : @xmath430 with the mixture of both phase flip and bit flip codes , the shor error - correction code can protect against bit flip errors , phase flip errors , as well as a combined bit and phase flip errors on any single qubit .",
    "in fact it has been shown that this simple quantum error - correction code can protect against the effects of any completely arbitrary errors on a  single qubit ( @xcite ) .",
    "quantum information science gains enormous attention in computer science , mathematics , physical sciences and engineering , and several interdisciplinary subfields are developing under the umbrella of quantum information .",
    "this paper reviews quantum computation and quantum information from a  statistical perspective .",
    "we introduce concepts like qubits , quantum gates and quantum circuits in quantum computation and discuss quantum entanglement , quantum parallelism and quantum error - correction in quantum computation and quantum information .",
    "we present major quantum algorithms and show their advantages over the available classical algorithms .",
    "we illustrate quantum simulation procedure and monte carlo methods in quantum simulation . as classical computation and simulation",
    "are ubiquitous nowadays in statistics , we expect quantum computation and quantum simulation will have a  paramount role to play in modern statistics .",
    "this paper exposes the topics to statisticians and encourages more statisticians to work in the fields .",
    "there are many statistical issues in theoretical research as well as experimental work in quantum computation , quantum simulation and quantum information .",
    "for example , as measurement data collected in quantum require more and more sophisticated statistical methods for better estimation , simulation and understanding , it is imperative to develop good quantum statistics methods and quantum simulation procedures and study interrelationship and mutual impact between quantum estimation and quantum simulation . since",
    "quantum computation is intrinsically random , and quantum simulation employs monte carlo techniques , as we point out in section  [ sec4.3 ] and @xcite , it is important to provide sound statistical methods for analyzing quantum algorithms and quantum simulation in general and study high - order approximations to exponentiate hamiltonians and the efficiency of the resulted quantum simulation procedures in particular . on the other hand , quantum computation and quantum simulation have great potential to revolutionize computational statistics .",
    "below are a few cases in point .    1 .",
    "the `` random numbers '' generated by classical computers are pseudo - random numbers in thesense that they are produced by deterministic procedures and can be exactly repeated and perfectly predicted given the deterministic schemes and the initial seeds . on the contrary ,",
    "superposition states enable quantum computers to produce genuine random numbers .",
    "for example , measuring @xmath103 yields @xmath92 and @xmath93 with equal probability .",
    "in general we generate @xmath0-bit binary random numbers @xmath235 , @xmath431 as follows .",
    "apply @xmath0 hadamard gates to @xmath0 qubits of @xmath432 to obtain @xmath433 where the sum is over all possible @xmath1 values of  @xmath120 , and then measure the obtained qubits and yield @xmath0-bit binary random numbers @xmath235 with equal probability .",
    "quantum theory guarantees that such random numbers are genuinely random .",
    "thus quantum computers are able to generate genuine random numbers and perform true monte carlo simulation .",
    "it is exciting to design general quantum random number generator and study quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "perhaps we may need to re - examine monte carlo simulation studies conducted by classical computers . 2 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the potential of quantum computation and quantum simulation for computational statistics .",
    "we expect that quantum computers may be much faster than classical computers for computing some statistical problems",
    ". moreover , quantum computers may be able to carry out some computational statistical tasks that are prohibitive by classical computers .",
    "specific examples are as follows : ( a ) we may use the basic ideas of grover s search algorithm to develop fast quantum algorithms for implementing some statistical procedures . for example , finding the median of a  huge data set is to search for a  numerical value that separates the top and bottom halves of the data , and quantum algorithms can offer quadratical speedup for calculating median and trimmed mean .",
    "( b ) with genuine random number generator and faster mean evaluation , quantum computers may offer significant advantages over classical computers for monte carlo integration .",
    "for example , monte carlo integration in high dimensions may be exponentially or quadratically faster on quantum computers than on classical computers .",
    "( c ) it might be possible for quantum computers to carry out some prohibiting statistical computing tasks like the bayesian computation discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "some preliminary research along these lines may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "3 .   as quantum computation and quantum simulation are ideal for simulating interacting particle systems like the ising model , it is fascinating to explore the interplay between quantum simulation and markov chain monte carlo methodology and the quantum potential to speed up markov chain based algorithms .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that quantum walk based algorithms can offer quadratical speedup for certain markov chain based algorithms ( @xcite ; ; @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "finally we point out that quantum computers are wonderful but it is difficult to build quantum computers with present technology . to build a quantum computer",
    "the physical apparatus must satisfy requirements that the quantum system realized qubits needs to be well isolated in order to retain its quantum properties and at the same time the quantum system has to be accessible so that the qubits can be manipulated to perform computations and measure output results .",
    "the two opposing requirements are determined by the strength of coupling of the quantum system to the external entities .",
    "the coupling causes quantum decoherence .",
    "decoherence refers to the loss of coherence between the components of a quantum system or quantum superposition from the interaction of the quantum system with its environment .",
    "it is very crucial but challenging to control a quantum system of qubits and correct the effects of decoherence in quantum computation and quantum information .",
    "quantum computing has witnessed great advances in recent years , and quantum computers of a handful of qubits and basic quantum communication devices have been built in research laboratories ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but there are technological hurdles in the development of a quantum computer of large capacity .",
    "history shows that scientific innovations and technological surprises are a never - ending saga .",
    "it is anticipated that quantum computers with a few dozen of qubits will be built in near future . as we have discussed in section  [ sec3.1 ] ,",
    "such a quantum computer has capacity of a classical supercomputer .",
    "we are very optimistic that someday quantum computers will be available for statisticians to crunch numbers .",
    "for the time being , instead of waiting in the sidelines for that to happen , statisticians should get into the field of play .",
    "it is time for us to dive into this frontier research and work with scientists and engineers to speed up the arrival of practical quantum computers . as a last note , in 2011",
    "a canadian company called d - wave has sold the claimed first commercial quantum computer of 128 qubits to the lockheed - martin corporation , despite the d - wave s quantum system being criticized as a black box .",
    "large scale quantum computers may be years away , but quantum computing is already here as a scientific endeavor to provoke deep thoughts and integrate profound questions in physics and computer science .",
    "wang s research was supported in part by nsf grant dms-10 - 05635 .",
