    "we fail to recover 6 objects from the @xcite  catalogue , which we visually confirm from figure  [ fig1 ] to be background galaxies .",

    "we approximate one - component fits to the 2-dimensional galaxy surface brightness distribution assuming a srsic profile @xcite .",
    "we split the fitting procedure into several steps : we create individual postage stamp images for each dwarf candidate and construct their segmentation maps using sextractor @xcite .",
    "these segmentation maps are then used to create bad pixel masks for each dwarf , masking any non - dwarf sources above a 3@xmath26 threshold , that produce dwarf - only images on which we perform the model fits .",

    "the robustness of the fitting procedure is estimated from a few systematically differing initial guesses for all model parameters .  for 88 non - nucleated dwarfs",
    ", all varying initial guesses immediately converged to the same solution and are thus considered to be robust fits .  on the other hand , for 114 , mostly fainter objects , galfit could not find a stable solution , so we refine the fitting by adopting the following iterative procedure .",
    "first , we estimate the total galaxy luminosity from sextractor mag_auto values using the corresponding segmentation maps .",
    "these magnitudes are then used as initial guesses for the galfit srsic models and kept fixed during the fit .  in this way",
    ", the fits are stabilized so that the remaining model parameters can be derived .",
    "next , the newly estimated parameters are kept fixed and the galaxy luminosity is recomputed with galfit .  in the final step of the procedure ,",
    "the newly determined magnitude is again fixed to recompute the other parameters .  in this way ,",
    "all non - nucleated dwarfs were successfully fit , and each galaxy model and residual image were visually inspected to ensure the derived parameters are statistically robust and provide reliable approximations .    to achieve consistent and meaningful fits for the nucleated dwarfs , we modified the procedure to properly account for the excess light in the nuclei .",
    "we first attempted to fit a galaxy model with two components , e.g.  a nuker or king profile for the nucleus and a srsic profile for the extended , diffuse galaxy spheroid .",
    "however , very few stable solutions were found for the nuclei due to their small sizes . as a solution to this problem , we instead mask the nuclei and then fit a single srsic to the outer diffuse galaxy spheroid .  from the residual images ( including the galaxy nuclei )",
    "we generate improved masks for the nuclei and any other sources contaminating the diffuse components of the dwarfs .",
    "this procedure resulted in stable fits for the diffuse spheroids of all nucleated dwarf galaxy candidates .",
    "again , the residual and model images for each galaxy were visually inspected to validate the robustness of the computed model parameters .    for 20 galaxies in our sample",
    "we could not obtain stable fits mostly due to their locations near bright stars or simply being too faint .",
    "all remaining 264 dwarfs can be reliably fit with a srsic model with @xmath27 and show a well - defined peak around @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent with previous measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which show that the main bodies of galaxies are well defined by a srsic profile with srsic indices that vary smoothly from @xmath29 ( devaucouleurs @xmath30 profile ) in the most massive systems to @xmath31 ( exponential profiles ) in the lowest mass galaxies .",
    "in this section we explore various parameter spaces of the newly expanded fornax dwarf galaxy population .  we first compare them to other galactic systems in the context of their respective size - luminosity relations , and then provide an overall view of their spatial distributions with respect to both each other , and the population of giant elliptical galaxies in the fornax cluster core .",
    "figure  [ dwarfsequence ] shows the effective radii vs.  absolute @xmath1-band magnitudes for our ngfs sample dwarf galaxies in relation to other stellar systems in the nearby universe .",
    "the detected fornax dwarfs range mainly between values of @xmath32 mag arcsec@xmath4 , with absolute luminosities down to approximately @xmath33 mag  similar to the virgo ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) recently detected by @xcite  and half - light radii from @xmath34pc up to @xmath35kpc .  for the 92 galaxies in common between our ngfs and the fcc catalogue ,",
    "we find good agreement between the magnitudes and effective radii , confirming the robustness of our measurements .",
    "the measured luminosities and structural parameters are provided in table  [ tab : dwarftable ] .    at the bright end of the ngfs sequence in figure  [ dwarfsequence ] we find dwarf galaxies that resemble ultra - diffuse galaxies identified by @xcite in virgo and @xcite in the coma cluster .",
    "we therefore confirm that udgs also exist in the central regions of the fornax galaxy cluster and are not confined to massive galaxy clusters alone .",
    "however , at a given luminosity the fornax dwarfs are significantly smaller than the coma and virgo udgs .",
    "the existence of such galaxies has been predicted and observed by @xcite .  at the faint end of the ngfs dwarf sequence ,",
    "the lowest surface brightness dwarfs find analogues in local group galaxies such as the draco , ursa major , and andromeda xxvii dwarf spheroidals @xcite .",
    "overall the ngfs dwarf sequence appears very similar to the size - luminosity relation of local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "however , within the photometric completeness limits of our data we detect a small offset towards a higher average surface brightness of ngfs dwarfs compared with local group dwarfs",
    ".  this might be due to either _",
    "i ) _ sample statistics of the fornax dwarf population , _ ii ) _ the harsher ram - pressure stripping and tidal environment in fornax which at a given total luminosity can render galaxies more compact @xcite or / and _ iii ) _ different star formation histories and stellar population properties of ngfs dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will discuss these relations in detail in a subsequent paper .",
    "we divide our sample into nucleated and non - nucleated dwarf galaxies , which was an obvious classification for almost all galaxies .",
    "those very few galaxies , with initially uncertain classification were also easily assigned to either of the categories after subtraction of their spheroid light component .",
    "we find that the nucleated dwarfs are on average significantly brighter than their non - nucleated counterparts .",
    "both nucleated and non - nucleated sub - samples clearly show a size - luminosity relation , in the sense of increasing size with increasing galaxy luminosity .  however , the slope of this trend is significantly shallower for the nucleated dwarfs .",
    "we investigate how the nucleation fraction ( @xmath36 ) changes as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "figure  [ dwarfsequence ] shows that @xmath36 is a strong function of galaxy luminosity in the sense that fainter dwarfs show systematically lower @xmath36 .",
    "we find that many fcc dwarfs had wrong nucleation flags and we revised their classification .",
    "we note that fcc galaxies are , on average , brighter than our newly detected dwarfs , and that 45 out of 92 reclassified fcc galaxies show a nucleus , i.e.  @xmath37% , which is consequence of the higher spatial resolution",
    ".  for the newly detected ngfs dwarfs only 15 out of 158 ( @xmath38% ) are nucleated .  in any case , figure  [ dwarfsequence ] clearly shows a trend of increasing nucleation fraction with galaxy spheroid luminosity .  for luminosities fainter than @xmath39mag",
    ", we observe @xmath40 , whereas for those galaxies brighter than @xmath41mag , @xmath36 increases to @xmath42% .    from hst / acs imaging analysis , @xcite find an average nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio , @xmath43 , for bright fornax early - type galaxies of 0.41% ,  which corresponds to a magnitude difference of 6 mag .",
    "considering our approximate point - source detection limit at @xmath44 mag , we should not be detecting nuclei in galaxies fainter than @xmath45mag , which we clearly do .",
    "this indicates that for those intermediate luminosity galaxies , _ i ) _ the galaxy spheroids are too faint for their nuclei , e.g.  due to tidal stripping of their halos , or _",
    "ii ) _ the nuclei are brighter than what would be expected from @xmath46 of brighter early - type galaxies , i.e.  hosting younger and/or lower - metallicity stellar populations , or _",
    "iii ) _ the formation of the nuclei was more efficient , i.e  at higher redshifts when the environmental density was higher .",
    "we will discuss this interesting result in an upcoming paper .",
    "a comprehensive view of the new dwarf candidate spatial distribution is illustrated in figure  [ surfdense ] , where the dwarfs have been limited to those within 60  ( @xmath24kpc ) of ngc1399 to ensure uniform angular representation .",
    "the result of a two - point angular correlation function @xcite analysis of the ngfs dwarf sample is shown in the top - left panel along with 1-@xmath26 bounds .",
    "on length scales below @xmath10kpc , an intriguing excess appears , indicating the clustering of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this may point to _ i ) _ dwarf - giant galaxy clustering or / and _ ii ) _ bound dwarf galaxy groups that survive in the galaxy cluster environment on those or smaller spatial scales .",
    "interestingly , such dwarf galaxy clustering has been reported in high - resolution numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we will investigate this result and its interpretation in a dedicated future paper .",
    "the bottom - left panel of figure  [ surfdense ] shows the projected radial surface number density ( @xmath47 ) profiles for the non - nucleated dwarfs ( red ) , nucleated fraction ( blue ) , and total population ( brown ) .",
    "the @xmath47 values show the number of dwarfs per arcmin@xmath21 within adaptively sized annuli containing 20 galaxies each for the total sample , and appropriately scaled for the two subsamples such that similar total data points are obtained , i.e.  15 and 5 galaxies per bin for the non - nucleated and nucleated samples , respectively .",
    "cluster centric distances corresponding to annuli mid - points are shown along the top- and bottom axes in physical and angular units .",
    "the non - nucleated sample and total population are both consistent with having flat @xmath47 distributions of @xmath48 out to @xmath49 , whereas the nucleated dwarf population ( noting the much smaller sample ) appears to decline outside of @xmath50 .",
    "however , this result requires confirmation with a larger sample from the full ngfs survey footprint .",
    "the distributions in azimuthal angles are shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ surfdense ] , where the color opacity has been decreased to show where the samples overlap .",
    "the smooth curves indicate non - parametric epanechnikov - kernel probability density estimates based on the discrete data , and each curve exhibits several distinct peaks .  for all curves , there is a noteworthy over density along the @xmath51 direction , which coincides with the inter - cluster medium between the giant galaxies ngc1427 and ngc1399 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the non - nucleated population appears much more stochastic , but with a notable broad distribution in the range @xmath52 , with individual peaks that closely follow the distributions of the other giant galaxies in the fornax core , e.g.  ngc1386 ( @xmath53 ) , ngc1387 , and 1379 ( @xmath54 ) , and ngc1374 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "while the total number of nucleated dwarf candidates prohibit making definitive statements , their distribution tends to follow the same general east - west bimodality , but without the discrete over densities shown by the populous samples .",
    "thus , while they are likely to trace the interactions between the dominant galaxies of fornax , their broader distributions limit what can be concluded regarding specific associations at this point .  the full ngfs survey dataset will expand this result to a larger - scale analysis .",
