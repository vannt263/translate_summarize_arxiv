    "galaxy clusters are being increasingly used as cosmological probes .",
    "the evolution of galaxy cluster abundances , for example , is sensitive to the values of cosmological parameters , and have been extensively studied in order to determine or constrain these parameters ( wang & steinhardt 1998 , holder 2001 , majumdar & mohr 2003 , 2004 , gladders 2007 , vikhlinin 2009 , rapetti 2009 , 2010 , rozo 2010 , sartoris 2010 ) .",
    "these attempts have been , however , limited by the inadequacy of our knowledge of the state of the intracluster medium ( icm ) of clusters .",
    "cluster scaling relations show that the distribution of the icm gas is different from simple models of cluster formation in which baryonic gas only reacts to the gravitational potential of the dark matter ( benson 2004 , da silva 2004 , bonaldi 2007 , bonamente 2008 ) .",
    "it is now believed that a number of non - gravitational processes may have affected the icm gas , including radiative cooling and energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and/or supernovae ( for example , see voit & bryan 2001 , nath & roychowdhury 2001 , balogh 2001 , borgani 2004 , roychowdhury 2004 , kravtsov 2005 , puchwein 2008 , battaglia 2010 ) .",
    "these processes tend to raise the entropy of the icm gas , essentially heating the gas and pushing it outward , and they make the gas less x - ray bright for a given temperature , and help in reconciling theoretical predictions with observed data .    in recent years",
    ", the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) temperature distortion of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) has received a lot of attention , in light of the possibility of observing a large number of clusters through sz effect , since the magnitude of the effect is independent of redshift ( birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "the scaling relations for sz effect is also altered by the non - gravitational processes mentioned above , and in general the magnitude of the sz effect is decreased by the non - gravitational processes mentioned above ( white , hernquist & springel 2002 , roychowdhury , ruszkowski & nath 2005 ) .",
    "recently , a universal pressure profile for the icm gas has been shown to fit the x - ray observations of clusters ( arnaud 2010 ) .",
    "this pressure profile can be combined with a mass model for the dark matter halo to yield the corresponding gas density and temperature profiles , and therefore its entropy profile . in this paper",
    ", we compare this entropy profile of the icm ( inferred from the observed universal pressure profile ) to determine the additional entropy needed for the icm gas , starting with a physically motivated profile that is expected in the absence of any feedback .",
    "the aim is to determine the additional entropy needed to explain the observations of local clusters in a phenomenological manner .",
    "we then speculate upon the possible evolution of entropy injection with redshift , and calculate the corresponding pressure profiles at high redshift .",
    "these profiles can be tested against the data for the evolution of cluster scaling relations with redshift ( e.g , between x - ray luminosity and temperature ) , and the evolution of entropy injection with redshift can be inferred with the help of this method .",
    "we show that although present available data are insufficient to constrain the evolution of entropy injection , one will be able to iterate with better data in future and determine the entropy injection at high redshift from observed cluster scaling relation evolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in @xmath1 , we show different ways to calculate the icm pressure profiles , in @xmath2 we model injected entropy , in @xmath3 we look at its evolution with redshift and we finally conclude in @xmath4 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the subscript @xmath5 for physical parameters related to the universal pressure profile by arnaud ( 2010 ) .",
    "also , we use the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 for initial and final profiles and values .",
    "recent observations by arnaud ( 2010 ) have shown that a scaled universal profile for the pressure of the icm can fit the x - ray observations . defining @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radius within which the mean over density is @xmath10 with respect to the critical density , this profile is given by ( eqns 9 , 11 , 13 of arnaud 2010 ) , p_u(x)=p_500 p_0 h_0.7 ^ 2 ( c_500 x)^ [ 1 + ( c_500 x)^ ] ^(-)/ [ eq : arnaud ] where , p_500 ( kev cm^-3)&=&1.65 10 ^ -3 e(z)^8/3 + & & ^2/3 + _ p + _ p (x ) , + p_0&= & 8.403 h_0.7 ^ -3/2 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the mass enclosed within @xmath9 , @xmath18 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , and @xmath20^{1/2}$ ] , is the ratio of the hubble constant at redshift @xmath21 to its present value .",
    "we assume a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile for the dark matter distribution ( navarro 1997 ) , along with an estimation of the concentration parameter @xmath22 from observations by comerford & natarajan ( 2007 ) , given by @xmath23 .",
    "we note that this prescription refers to the total cluster mass and is an empirical one .",
    "however , we have found that our final results are largely insensitive to the assumptions of the concentration parameter ( see also chaudhuri & majumdar 2011 ) .",
    "we also use the analytical fit by bryan & norman ( 1988 ) for the over density @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , with which one can calculate the virial radius , as , r_vir= ( m_vir ( 4 /3 ) _ crit ( z ) _",
    "c(z ) ) ^1/3 .    in order to determine the additional entropy we need to use a default profile for the icm gas that is predicted in the absence of any energy input . following the tradition in x - ray astronomy",

    "there are three possibilities in this regard :    * \\(a ) one can either use an entropy profile that one expects from the consideration of icm gas getting heated at the accretion shock , and in the absence of radiative cooling .",
    "voit ( 2005 ) showed that simulations with only gravitational processes yield a power law entropy profile of type @xmath29 , where s_200=_e^2/3 m_p^5/3 2 ^2/3 . here , we use an equivalent expression that uses @xmath9 , taken from pratt ( 2010 ) , using the observed mean value of @xmath30 for relaxed clusters ( pointecouteau 2005 ) , s(r)/s_500= 1.42 ( r / r_500)^1.1 where s_500= 106 kev cm^-2 ^2/3 ( 1 f_g ) ^2/3 e(z)^-2/3 h_0.7 ^ -4/3 , @xmath31 being the baryon fraction .",
    "this assumes a metallicity of @xmath32 and a mean molecular weight @xmath33 .",
    "this profile appears to fit the results of simulations without radiative cooling , with approximately 20% dispersion , especially beyond @xmath34 ( see also mitchell 2009 ) .",
    "+ assuming the initial gas distribution to have this entropy profile , @xmath35 , and assuming this gas to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with a given total mass profile , the initial gas pressure profile , @xmath36 can be obtained from , & = & - gm(r ) 4 r^4 + d r dm_g & = & 1 4 r^2 ( ^3/5_e^2/5 ) m_p ^-3/5 , [ eq : hydros1 ] where @xmath37 is the total mass inside radius @xmath38 , given by the nfw profile , and @xmath39 is the gas mass inside @xmath38 .",
    "these equations can be solved with the boundary conditions that @xmath40 at @xmath41 , and that the total gas fraction inside the virial radius , @xmath42 .",
    "* \\(b ) simulations that include radiative cooling , however , can also be used to obtain an initial profile that we can compare with the observed profile in order to determine the additional entropy needed .",
    "loken ( 2002 ) found from simulations with cooling a universal temperature profile in the range @xmath43 , given by , t_i ( r ) = 1.33 t ( 1+(1.5r / r_vir))^ 1.6 , where @xmath44 is the emission weighted temperature of the cluster gas .",
    "we use an empirically derived scaling relation to determine this temperature , from the observations of finoguenov ( 2001 ) , ( although there may be an order unity difference between these two definitions of emission weighted temperature ) m_500=(2.64^+0.39_-0.34)10 ^ 13 m _ ( k_b t 1 kev ) ^1.78 .",
    "we can then compute the initial gas density profile assuming the gas to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and using the above mentioned temperature profile , = - gm(r ) r^2 .",
    "[ eq : hydros ] the gas fraction within the virial radius is assumed to be equal to the cosmic baryon fraction , @xmath45 .",
    "the inferred gas density and temperature profiles can then be used to derive the initial entropy profile @xmath46 . *",
    "\\(c ) one can also use a profile with a polytropic equation of state , @xmath47 .",
    "li ( 2010 ) has recently used this as a fiducial profile , with @xmath48 .",
    "the normalization comes from the assumption of total gas fraction within the virial radius to be same as the cosmic gas fraction , as in the above models .",
    "the initial pressure profiles resulting from these three possible initial entropy profiles can be compared with the observed universal pressure profile of arnaud ( 2010 ) .",
    "given the observed pressure profile , one can get to density , temperature and entropy profile , by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we determine the gas density profile , @xmath49 , using hydrostatic equilibrium condition and the observed universal pressure ( eqn [ eq : arnaud ] ) , = - gm(r ) r^2 .",
    "we note that the observed pressure profile refers only to electron pressure and we should multiply the electron pressure @xmath50 , by the ratio of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath53 is the mean molecular weights per free electron , their values being appropriate for a gas with metallicity of @xmath32 .. ]    once the gas density profile is calculated , the corresponding temperature profile is then readily computed as @xmath54 , and then the entropy profile , @xmath55 .",
    "we show in figure 1 the three initial entropy profiles for a given cluster mass : the case of universal temperature profile ( dashed line ) , that of a polytropic equation of state with @xmath56 ( dot - dashed line ) , and the scaled entropy profile of voit ( 2005 ) ( dotted line ) .",
    "the solid curve shows the entropy profile corresponding to the observed universal pressure profile of arnaud ( 2010 ) . as expected",
    ", the computed initial profile using radiative cooling ( dashed line ) has a higher entropy than the power - law profile expected without cooling ( dotted line ) .",
    "it should be noted that these curves should be used only for @xmath57 \\ge -1.5 $ ] , where the observational data are more secure than in the inner regions .",
    "we can see that the inferred entropy at @xmath58 is several times higher than the one expected from purely adiabatic case .",
    "= 0.4    -3 mm    given these choices for the initial entropy profile , we choose the one with power - law entropy , of voit ( 2005 ) , for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the polytropic gas profile lacks physical motivation , since it is not clear why the icm gas should behave in a polytropic manner in the absence of feedback . secondly , although the universal temperature profile from radiative simulations is an appealing choice , it is not clear as to what extent it depends on the parameters used in the simulations , and also its possible redshift variation is unclear .",
    "on the contrary , the power - law entropy profile is simple and rests on basic assumptions for the behaviour of gas in a gravitational potential well .",
    "next we compute the additional injected entropy needed to reconcile the initial profiles with the observed ones .",
    "the extra entropy can be expressed in different ways depending on the manner in which entropy is injected into the icm .",
    "previous workers have characterized the additional entropy as a constant entropy floor that is independent of the radius .",
    "for example , li ( 2010 ) have recently used a value of @xmath59 kev @xmath60 to determine the icm pressure profile for their calculation of the sz effect .",
    "this choice of characterizing the injected entropy is motivated by the curves showed in figure 1 , in which the gas at lower radius appears to have an entropy floor.    there is , however , one problem with this characterization .",
    "when one adds entropy to the initial profile , the gas shells move outward . in other words , entropy added at one position is carried elsewhere by the movement of the gas , and so the comparison of final and initial entropies at a given radial position does not remain physically significant .",
    "as li ( 2010 ) have also recently noted , the injected entropy should be characterized by the gas shell in which the injection has occurred . in other words , one should compare @xmath61 with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the gas fraction inside a radius @xmath38 .",
    "note that this gas fraction is different from the usual definition of gas fraction in the literature , @xmath64 ; we distinguish these two distinct parameters by using two different notations for them .",
    "we show in figure 2 the corresponding entropy profiles , as functions of @xmath65 , for @xmath66 m@xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that the observed profile ( solid line ) corresponds to a case where the gas fraction within @xmath68 has decreased from the initial value @xmath69 , implying outward movement of gas shells .",
    "the entropy floor that appears in the entropy profile in radial direction exists here only for the very inner shells of gas . for most of the gas in the cluster",
    ", the ( logarithm of ) final entropy ( solid line ) is approximately separated from the initial profiles by an additive factor , which translates to a multiplicative factor for entropy . viewed in this way , in terms of entropy injection in lagrangian gas shells",
    ", we find it useful to characterize the entropy injection as a combination of an entropy floor and a multiplicative factor for the initial profile : @xmath70 .",
    "= 0.4    -3 mm    the two terms have different physical implications .",
    "note that the entropy ( @xmath71 ) used here is proportional to the _ logarithm _ of gas entropy .",
    "if there had been no constant term ( @xmath72 ) , then we could write the excess energy per particle as @xmath73 , and the entropy @xmath74 , then we have @xmath75 . here , since the temperature is a weak function of radius , a constant @xmath76 would imply a near uniform injection of energy .",
    "on the other hand , if the entropy injection were to be only characterized with a constant term , then we would have @xmath77 , which would imply that energy feedback works mostly in the inner regions where the gas density is highest .",
    "our adopted characterization , with a constant term and a multiplicative factor essentially allows provisions for both these modes of energy feedback .    in order to determine the level of entropy injection ( namely , the value of @xmath76 ) , we solve the following equations for hydrostatic equilibrium for the final gas profile : = & & m_vir 4 r^2 m_p ( p_f s_f k_b ) ^-3/5 + dp_f df_g = & & -g m(r)r^2 m_vir 4 r^2 , where @xmath78 .",
    "the three variables to be determined here are @xmath79 , and we need three boundary conditions to solve these equations .",
    "one is an obvious choice : ( 1 ) @xmath80 .",
    "( 2 ) another obvious choice is that @xmath81 , so that the final pressure profile corresponds to the observed universal pressure profile .",
    "lastly we use the value of gas fraction at an outer radius , but this requires an explanation .    for the third boundary condition",
    ", we use the value of @xmath82 ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) that corresponds to the universal pressure profile .",
    "we note that the gas fraction at @xmath9 as given by the universal pressure profile is different from the ratio of @xmath84 , which implies that a fraction of the original icm gas has been thrown out of the system , if one considers the ratio @xmath45 to be universal initially .",
    "we show in figure 3 the gas fraction implied by the universal pressure profile , and compare with other observations .",
    "note that observations of gas fraction within @xmath9 usually refers to @xmath85 . in figure 3",
    "we show the values of @xmath86 as given by the universal pressure profile ( solid line ) for clusters at @xmath87 and compare them with the observed values ( dotted line ) , as reported by sun ( 2009 ) .",
    "we also show by the dashed line another ratio , that of the gas mass within a radius @xmath88 and the total virial mass of the cluster .",
    "this ratio , @xmath89 , is found to be _ almost a constant _ for all clusters , and close to the value of @xmath45 , shown by the dot - dashed line , with an average deviation of order @xmath90 .",
    "this interesting result suggests that a fraction of the icm gas , originally inside @xmath91 and with a universal gas fraction of @xmath45 , gets ejected due to the feedback process , but that the gas does not extend beyond a radius @xmath88 .",
    "entropy feedback predominantly affects the gas while keeping the dark matter unchanged . in this case",
    ", gas mass conservation will ensure that @xmath92 , where the latter term is the gas mass within @xmath88 after the feedback processes . dividing both sides by @xmath93 , and recalling that the initial profile is normalized by @xmath94 , yields the condition for the final profile , @xmath95 .",
    "the choice of the final radius to be @xmath88 is slightly arbitrary .",
    "however , this choice is consistent with the findings of battaglia 2010 , who show that there is significant contribution to the sz flux from beyond the virial radius , and going beyond @xmath88 does not add to the sz power .",
    "this result allows us to use a boundary condition , that the gas fraction @xmath96 .",
    "we also show in figure 3 by two thin dashed lines the results for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the total spread is of order @xmath99 of the values of @xmath100 .",
    "this is the level of uncertainty in our results that stems from the lack of precise knowledge about the outer boundary condition .",
    "= 0.4    -3 mm    we find that with the above mentioned assumptions and boundary conditions , the following prescription of entropy injection works satisfactorily in converting the initial entropy profile to the final profile as given by the universal pressure profile at @xmath87 , for @xmath101 : s_inj(f_g)= 200 kev cm^-2 + 2 ( ) ^-0.2 s_i(f_g ) .",
    "[ eq : pres ]    the values of the coefficients provide the best match within an accuracy of @xmath102 .",
    "this form of the feedback implies that low mass clusters need overall more feedback than rich clusters , although ( from the constant term ) all clusters appear to need feedback in their central regions .",
    "physically these two modes may refer to preheating and agn / sn feedback processes , one in which all the gas particles in the icm are energized and another , in which particles in the central region get more entropy than elsewhere .",
    "we show below that from _ the comparison of the final pressure profile and the initial pressure profiles , that it would be impossible to achieve the final pressure profile with only a single mode of entropy injection_.    we show in figures 4 and 5 two examples of the result of this type of entropy injection , for @xmath103 m@xmath67 and @xmath66 m@xmath67 , respectively , at z=0 .",
    "the top - left panels of both figures show the density profiles : dashed lines show the initial profile of power - law entropy ; the dot - dashed lines show the profile corresponding to the universal pressure profile and the dotted lines show the final profile , which is a result of the entropy injection according to the above mentioned prescription .",
    "the top - right panels show the temperature profile , the bottom - left panels show the pressure profile and the bottom - right panels show the entropy profiles .    before discussing the results ,",
    "let us summarize the method of our calculation .",
    "we have began with a power - law entropy profile , and used a prescription for entropy injection , which along with the above mentioned boundary conditions yield a pressure profile .",
    "we iterate a loop until the three boundary conditions are matched ( within @xmath104 ) .",
    "this leads to a match with the observed universal pressure profile because of the chosen entropy injection prescription ( [ eq : pres ] ) . as a result",
    ", we find in figures 4 and 5 that the final pressure profiles ( bottom - left panels , dotted lines ) match well the observed profile ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "the match for the temperature ( top right panels ) and entropy ( bottom right panels ) profiles are less satisfactory , but we note that the dot - dashed lines here are not observed profiles , but inferred from the universal pressure profiles . since we have decided to peg our boundary conditions on the observed pressure profiles , we conclude that the above entropy injection prescription gives a satisfactory match with observations .",
    "_ since a single prescription appears to work for the whole range of cluster masses , one could call it a universal entropy injection prescription_.    = 0.4    -3 mm    = 0.4    -3 mm",
    "our exercise has so far been limited to observed clusters at low redshifts : we have used a physically motivated initial gas profile , and compared it to the observed profile to deduce a prescription for entropy injection .",
    "it is true that the entropy injection prescription allows us to speculate on the kind of feedback process that may give rise to the entropy enhancement .",
    "the prescription , however , remains a phenomenological one , and we wish to explore its usefulness beyond the regime within which it has been deduced in the previous section .",
    "in particular , we wish to study the icm in high redshift galaxy clusters , and determine the amount of feedback that may have occurred at high redshift .",
    "the properties of the icm at high redshift have been studied through the observations of evolution of cluster scaling laws , e.g. , the relations between x - ray luminosity and temperature , and with the help of numerical simulations . in the rest of the paper , we show that our semi - analytical formalism can help in this regard , by determining the amount of feedback needed to produce an icm profile that is consistent with redshift evolution of cluster scaling relations .",
    "voit ( 2005 ) had suggested that cluster scaling relations would differ at high redshifts owing to the effects of feedback and radiative cooling ( see also muanwong , kay & thomas 2006 ; short 2010 ) .    at present , however , the usefulness of this method is limited by the lack of accurate determinations of scaling relation evolutions . ettori ( 2004 ) found that the evolution of @xmath105 relation in a sample of 28 clusters at @xmath106 followed the self - similar model , expected from simple cosmological considerations .",
    "but they found the normalization of the @xmath107 relation to decrease with redshift , which was later confirmed by hilton ( 2007 ) from a study of a high redshift cluster with @xmath108 ( see also branchesi 2007 ) .",
    "morandi ( 2007 ) found negative evolution in the @xmath105 relation but a positive evolution for @xmath107 relation ( see also maughan 2007 ) . at the same time , maughan ( 2006 ) found little evidence for any such redshift evolution apart from that expected from self - similarity .",
    "one reason for this uncertainty is the scatter produced by the large x - ray luminosity at the centres of cool core clusters ( chen 2007 ) .",
    "cluster mergers also produce deviations ( kravtsov 2006 ) .",
    "also , the sample of small number of clusters at high redshift suffers from selection effects ( pacaud 2007 ) .",
    "it is hoped that a large and homogeneous sample will be gleaned from the upcoming xmm cluster survey ( xcs ) ( romer 2001 ) , and allow a better determination of the evolution of x - ray scaling relations .",
    "= 0.4    -3 mm    keeping these uncertainties in the observed relations in mind , we would like to extend our phenomenological study to high redshift clusters .",
    "for this exercise , we need to assume a redshift evolution of the feedback prescription .",
    "also , instead of changing the boundary conditions with redshift , we assume that the boundary conditions at high redshift is the same as at @xmath87 , namely , @xmath80 , and that @xmath109 .",
    "this will yield the gas profiles , which can then be compared with the expectations from scaling relation evolutions .",
    "this process can then be iterated to determine the amount of feedback that is required to explain the evolution of the cluster scaling relations .",
    "this iteration will make sense with accurate determination of scaling relation evolutions , and in the absence of such observations , we only demonstrate the first part of this process , namely , prediction of icm at high z corresponding to a given feedback prescription and how this can be used to compare with observed cluster scaling relation evolutions .",

    "= 0.4    -3 mm",
    "figure 7 shows that the self - similar evolution of the universal pressure profile ( solid line ) is consistent with the available data . the case for constant entropy injection ( dot - dashed line ) and positive evolution",
    "do not fare well , and the match with the data improves for negative redshift evolution ( dashed line ) of entropy injection . as mentioned earlier , the self - similarly scaled universal pressure profile is equivalent to a scaling of entropy injection as @xmath135 , and the solid line therefore also shows the case of a steep negative evolution with @xmath117 .",
    "the results from enhanced entropy are largely consistent with the range of results from current simulations including feedback and preheating ( shown by the dotted lines marked as fo and pc ) .",
    "the curves in figure 8 show that the self - similar evolution of the universal pressure profile is consistent with the available data , and that the data favour negative evolution of entropy injection in general . the enhanced profile with our simple scaling law",
    "are consistent with the results from simulations including feedback . comparing with the data , which include low - redshift observational data from rexcess (",
    "pratt 2009 ; short 2010 ) and high redshift data from maughan ( 2006 ) , we find that the case of constant entropy injection matches better and , as in the case of @xmath107 relation , the situation improves with negative redshift evolution .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the likelihood of the values of @xmath112 that is allowed by the data is beyond the scope of the present paper , and we will pursue this approach in a future paper , and determine the possible evolution of entropy injection , parameterized by certain variables whose values could be determined by comparing with existing data . but",
    "the trend shown in figure 8 , indicates that the available data require an evolution of the entropy injection that scales as @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "note that owing to the non - gravitational nature of the feedback processes , the enhanced entropy need not evolve self - similarly with redshift .",
    "however , the entropy of gas as determined by gravity alone is expected to evolve self - similarly , namely , @xmath138 for clusters with same mass .",
    "nevertheless , we can compare the entropy scaling inferred above with the self - similar scaling . in @xmath139-cdm model , @xmath140 roughly scales as @xmath141 in this redshift range .",
    "therefore , the scaling @xmath142 can be written as @xmath143,which is indicative of a non - standard evolution .    a more important conclusion that we can draw from the previous section , however , is that that in the presence of accurately determined cluster scaling relation evolution , as is expected in the near future , one will be able to compare the predictions from entropy injection with that from redshift evolution of cluster scaling relations , and therefore iterate in order to determine the entropy enhancement at high redshift .",
    "fang & haiman ( 2008 ) have argued , on the basis of a simple model of evolving entropy floors for the icm with redshift and comparing the results with observed evolution of scaling relations , that the entropy floor at high redshift is likely to be shallower than that at present .",
    "they argued that a deceasing entropy floor with redshift is expected from feedback processes due to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and supernovae driven winds .",
    "it is however difficult to interpret the amount of feedback only from the level of the entropy floor , since the default entropy at high redshift is also likely to be small , from cosmological evolution .",
    "entropy , as defined by @xmath144 , would normally evolve as @xmath140 , for clusters with same virial mass , in the absence of any feedback process .",
    "any deviation from this can be identified as the result of a feedback process .",
    "for example , ettori ( 2004 ) found that for clusters with same temperatures , the entropy floor evolves as @xmath145 .",
    "nath ( 2004 ) interpreted this as the result of increasing feedback energy deposition at higher redshifts , possibly as a result of increase in the abundance of agns at high redshift .    our work in this paper presents a method of determining the amount of feedback and its evolution with redshift , by using an initial entropy profile and injecting entropy into the profile ( defined by radially distributed gas shells ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how the entropy injection prescription is related to any physical process of feedback , and we will return to this issue in a future paper .",
    "finally , we note that our results are accurate up to @xmath102 , given the accuracy with which we have implemented the boundary conditions in arriving at our results .",
    "our analysis presented here has ignored the contribution from non - thermal pressure of the gas , which can lead to underestimating the mass by @xmath146 around @xmath147 at @xmath148 at the virial radius ( see for example , rasia 2004 ) , but which would have introduced additional free parameters , and more uncertainties in the interpretation of cluster scaling relation data , the results of the entropy injection prescription .",
    "the simplicity of the entropy injection prescription presented in this paper , however , may make it possible to include non - thermal pressure .",
    "there is another source of uncertainty that arises from the fact that a fraction of the baryons in clusters would form stars , and would thus affect the boundary condition for normalization .",
    "although gonzalez ( 2007 ) found that the stellar mass fraction in a cluster of @xmath149 m@xmath67 can be as large as @xmath150 ( see also giodini 2009 ; andreon 2010 ) , balogh ( 2008 ) have found that such a large fraction , if confirmed , would cause problem for the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation , let alone being an overcooling problem . on the other hand a conservative estimate from bower ( 2006 )",
    "is that the stellar fraction is @xmath151 times the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "this is also in agreement with hydro simulations of clusters ( ettori 2006 ) .",
    "recently , simionescu ( 2011 ) have found from suzaku observations of the perseus cluster that the baryon fraction approaches the universal value much earlier than the virial radius .",
    "all of these would imply that our boundary conditions used here would be modified by a factor @xmath152 , and the resulting profiles would differ by @xmath90 and , hence , would decrease the required entropy injection by a similar fraction .",
    "we have neglected the contribution of star formation in this paper because our entropy injection prescriptions are accurate up to @xmath102 ."
