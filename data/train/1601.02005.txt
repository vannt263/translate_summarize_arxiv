    "this report serves to review and analyze a body of recent findings on the phase diagram of dilute nuclear matter , calculated over wide ranges of density , temperature , and isospin asymmetry .",
    "quantitative results will be presented for the temperature - density ( @xmath0 ) phase diagram at baryon densities below about half the saturation density of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter , but pairing phenomena that may occur at somewhat higher densities will also be addressed .",
    "the corresponding studies @xcite , both theoretical and numerical , focus attention on the emergence of unconventional as well as conventional pairing in the @xmath1-@xmath2 ( deuteron ) channel as well as associated bcs - bec crossovers .",
    "earlier work on these and closely related themes has been described in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "application of _ ab initio _",
    "quantum many - body theory to this problem domain has the distinct advantage that , within the density regime considered in the numerical study , the two - body nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions are well constrained by the nn phase - shift data and the properties of the deuteron . nor is the problem purely academic , as it is directly relevant to the matter existing in supernovae envelopes and proto - neutron stars ( having relatively low temperatures and low isospin asymmetries ) and in neutron star crusts ( cold , with large isospin asymmetries ) .",
    "the complex phenomenology of dilute nuclear matter , summarized in its @xmath0 phase diagram determined over a range of isospin asymmetries , arises from three sources :    * pauli exclusion acting for fermionic species ( nucleons , tritons , @xmath3he , etc . ) and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of bosonic species ( such as deuterons and alpha particles ) .",
    "these are most effective at high particle densities ( but below nuclear saturation ) , low temperatures , and low mass number of nuclear species .",
    "* dominance of the longer - range attractive component of the @xmath4 interaction . at low densities and not - so - low temperatures ,",
    "this component is responsible for the formation of tightly bound nuclear clusters ( deuterons , dineutrons ( ? ) , tritons , alphas , ... ) , which can undergo bec in the case of bosonic clusters . at higher densities and low temperatures",
    "it is responsible for the formation of cooper pairs with pairing gap @xmath5 . at small",
    "isospin asymmetries the pairing is in the triplet @xmath1-@xmath2 channel , whereas for large asymmetries the pairing is in the @xmath6 singlet channel .",
    "* isospin asymmetry , induced by weak interactions , producing a mismatch of neutron ( @xmath7 ) and proton ( @xmath8 ) fermi momenta , giving rise to mixed superfluid / normal phases and unconventional pairing @xmath9 cooper pairs with nonzero center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum ( the so - called loff phase @xcite ) or deformed neutron and proton fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief examination of the low - density phase diagram for the fiducial case of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter with equal neutron and proton baryon densities , @xmath10 , as explored in @xcite .",
    "a model of low - density nuclear matter based on a simplified two - nucleon interaction was considered which exhibits behavior generic to systems of fermions interacting via a short - range repulsion and a longer - range attraction .",
    "such behavior includes both ( i ) formation of clusters tightly bound in the medium at lower densities and higher temperatures , and ( ii ) cooper pairing in a bcs state at lower temperatures and higher densities .",
    "specifically , a malfliet - tjon model with mf - iii parametrization @xcite was chosen for the @xmath4 interaction , consisting of a central but spin - dependent superposition of inner repulsive and outer attractive yukawas , fitted to @xmath4 @xmath11-wave phase shifts and deuteron binding .",
    "this interaction shows a strong pairing instability in the @xmath12 channel .    to study the low - temperature superfluid phase , the bcs gap equation was solved self - consistently for the energy gap @xmath13 and the chemical potential @xmath14 below the critical temperature @xmath15 , with results shown in fig",
    ".  1 . proceeding from higher to lower densities in the domain under study , conditions range from weak coupling ( wc ) to strong coupling ( sc ) as measured by the ratio @xmath16 ; a change of sign of the chemical potential from positive to negative is a signature of the wc @xmath17 sc transition . in the low-@xmath18 limit the gap equation reduces to the schrdinger equation for the two - body bound state , with energy eigenvalue given by @xmath19 , which is naturally identified with the deuteron and subject to bose - einstein condensation .",
    "accordingly , this earlier study provides a model of the bcs - bec transition from bcs cooper pairing in the @xmath20 state to a bose condensate of simplified deuterons .    , where @xmath21 denotes the baryon density and @xmath22 @xmath23 the saturation density of symmetrical nuclear matter .",
    "values of the dimensionless density parameter @xmath24 assume a scattering length @xmath25 fm . ]",
    "to extend the phase diagram to higher temperatures , the lippmann - schwinger and faddeev equations were adapted to solve two- and three - nucleon bound - state problems in the presence of a dispersive fermionic background medium and attendant pauli blocking effects .",
    "evolution of clustering into deuteron dimers and triton and helion trimers was followed under increasing temperature and/or decreasing density . for small temperatures",
    "the quantum degeneracy is large and pauli blocking strongly suppresses the binding energy of these clusters , which are quenched at a common critical temperature @xmath26 .",

    "]    the results on pairing and bound states are combined to produce the schematic phase diagram in fig .",

    "* the low - temperature , low - density domain ( lower left : @xmath31 ) contains a bose condensate of tightly - bound deuterons . *",
    "the low - temperature , high - density domain ( lower right : @xmath32 ) features a bcs condensate of weakly - bound cooper pairs . *",
    "the domain between the two critical lines @xmath29 and @xmath33 contains normal nucleonic @xmath34 liquid .",
    "the superfluid phases labeled b and c are characterized by broken symmetry associated with the @xmath35 condensate .",
    "the transition c to b does not involve symmetry changes @xmath9 it is a smooth crossover from the bcs to the bec condensate .",
    "b @xmath17 l and c",
    "@xmath17 l are second - order phase transitions related to the vanishing of the condensate along the line @xmath33 .",
    "the transition g @xmath17 l ( e.g. , at vertical line ) is characterized by an order parameter given by the fraction of trimers , which goes to zero at @xmath29 ( tentatively second order ) .",
    "the phase diagram of dilute nuclear matter becomes much more complex upon introduction of isospin asymmetry as another control variable , measured by @xmath36 in terms of neutron and proton number densities @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "unconventional superfluid and heterogeneous phases then emerge , largely dictated by mismatch of neutron and proton fermi momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which entails incomplete overlap of spherical neutron and proton fermi spheres .",
    "as is well known , this mismatch may be mitigated by deformation of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 fermi spheres so as to increase their phase - space overlap @xcite .",
    "otherwise , phase - space overlap may be enhanced by the formation of cooper pairs having non - zero cm momentum @xcite .",
    "this is the alternative explored quite thoroughly in the recent work that is the primary subject of this paper .",
    "bcs pairing theory will be generalized to this case in the next section .",
    "increase of temperature is another option for compensating the mismatch of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , due to the smearing of both fermi surfaces .",
    "this effect , as well as the energetic advantage of dimerization at lower densities , gives rise to heterogeneous phases with superfluid and normal components .",
    "the problem now has two energy scales : the pairing gap @xmath5 in the @xmath1-@xmath2 channel , realistic @xmath4 interactions now being employed , and the shift @xmath41 between chemical potentials of neutrons and protons . with increasing isospin asymmetry",
    ", @xmath42 increases from zero to values of order @xmath5 , and a sequence of unconventional phases will appear .",
    "a bcs suitable gap equation allowing for cooper pairs with nonzero cm momentum may be derived in quasiparticle approximation in the framework of imaginary - time finite - temperature green s functions and the nambu - gorkov basis @xcite .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle spectra are written in a general reference frame moving with cm momentum @xmath43 relative to a laboratory rest frame .",
    "this _ ab initio _ many - body theory yields solutions of the form @xmath44 @xmath45 for the normal and anomalous green s functions , respectively , where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 being any integer .",
    "there are four quasiparticle spectral branches specified by @xmath49 where , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 the isospin asymmetry enters through the parameter @xmath52 , while @xmath53 is the mean chemical potential .    in mean - field approximation ,",
    "the anomalous self - energy ( pairing gap ) is expressed as @xmath54 \\label{anom}\\ ] ] in terms of the above anomalous propagators , where @xmath55 is the @xmath30 pairing interaction .",
    "the next steps toward deriving the gap equation as used in the numerical study of pairing in dilute nuclear matter involve ( i ) evaluation of the matsubara sum over @xmath48 in the above expression , ( ii ) performing a partial wave expansion , and ( iii ) restricting attention to the @xmath1-@xmath2 channel , in which the appropriate @xmath30 interaction is denoted by @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",

    "the coupled gap equations and the two density equations were solved self - consistently for a bare pairing interaction in the @xmath1-@xmath2 partial wave , as provided by a phase - equivalent in - vacuum @xmath4 interaction , namely by the paris potential , thus implying cooper pairing in the @xmath64 , @xmath65 spin - isospin channel .",
    "as needed , the nuclear mean field is modeled by a skyrme density functional , with skiii and sly4 parametrizations yielding nearly identical results .",
    "two simplifications are made :    * polarization effects , i.e. , medium modification of the input @xmath4 interaction ( due for example to virtual exchange of density and spin - density excitations ) are neglected , although they are known to be important in some regions of the phase diagram . *",
    "apart from deuteron dimerization in the bec phases , effects of nuclear clustering are not considered , although at somewhat higher temperatures one expects substantial populations of tritons , @xmath3he nuclei , and @xmath66 particles , along with deuterons .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath67 cooper pairing in the @xmath68 , @xmath69 spin - isospin channel may mix and eventually replace @xmath1-@xmath2 pairing at asymptotically low @xmath70 ( below 0.5 mev ) and high asymmetry .",
    "the phase at each point in the @xmath0 phase diagram is determined by minimization of the free energy . in the case of pre - bec homogeneous phases ( perhaps translationally noninvariant )",
    ", there are three possibilities : ( i ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( bcs phase ) , ( ii ) @xmath73 , @xmath72 ( loff phase ) , and ( iii ) @xmath71 , @xmath74 ( unpaired , normal phase ) .",
    "the ground state is determined by minimization of the free energy @xmath75 of the superfluid ( @xmath76 ) or unpaired normal phase ( @xmath77 ) with respect to the parameter @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the internal energy determined from the hamiltonian and @xmath11 the entropy .",
    "stability of the superfluid phase requires @xmath80 .",
    "as already indicated , there can also be a ( pre - bec ) heterogeneous , phase - separated phase , denoted ps - bcs .",
    "its free energy takes the form of a linear combination of superfluid and unpaired free energies , @xmath81 which is to be minimized with respect to the filling fraction @xmath82 of the unpaired component .",

    "in this section we present an overview of the diverse phases that arise as the calculation proceeds from higher to lower densities in dilute nuclear matter at chosen isospin asymmetries @xmath87 .",
    "as specified , the microscopic calculation yields a smooth crossover from the pure bcs phase to an asymptotic state corresponding to a mixture of a deuteron bec and a normal gas of the left - over unpaired neutrons .",
    "the transition from bcs to bec is identified by two criteria : ( i ) the average chemical potential @xmath88 changes its sign from positive to negative values , and ( ii ) the coherence length @xmath89 of a cooper pair becomes comparable to the interparticle distance @xmath90 , @xmath91 as @xmath89 ranges from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .      at @xmath94",
    "the loff state can emerge due to the energetic advantage gained with a condensate that breaks translational symmetry : cooper pairs that carry a nonzero cm momentum @xmath43 can compensate for the mismatch of neutron and proton chemical potentials .",
    "the calculations reveal the existence of a loff - state gap of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter in a narrow regime at relatively low @xmath70 and relatively high @xmath18 values , having a maximum at finite @xmath78 , implying maximum condensation energy for such pairs . at large @xmath66",
    ", the maximum gap occurs at large values of @xmath78 . on the other hand , at a given asymmetry , an increase of temperature shifts the gap maximum and free - energy minimum toward smaller @xmath78 . with reduction of asymmetry , increase of temperature , and/or decrease of density , the bcs phase regains favor over the loff phase , with ps - bcs phase having the advantage in the contest at lower temperatures .",
    "this behavior relative to the loff phase is well understood in terms of the phase - space overlap of the fermi surfaces of neutrons and protons , which increases with increasing temperature on the one hand , and with momentum @xmath78 on the other .",
    "similarly , the ps - bcs phase , in which a standard ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) bcs component coexists with a normal fermi liquid made up of the excess unpaired neutrons , is clearly favored energetically relative to pure bcs and loff phases at the lowest temperatures , where there is little benefit from eroded fermi surfaces of from forfeit of translational invariance .    what remains is an account of how the bcs - bec crossover is affected by the existence of the unconventional nuclear loff and ps phases at nonzero @xmath66 , under decrease of system density .     as indicated for the plotted lines .",
    "four phases are represented : the normal , unpaired phase , the bcs ( bec ) phase , the loff phase , and a ps - bcs ( ps - bec ) phase . at each asymmetry",
    "there are two tri - critical points , one always being lifshitz point . for special values of asymmetry",

    "the phase diagram shows two types of bcs to bec crossovers from the asymmetrical bcs phase to the bec phase of deuterons and an embedded normal gas of excess neutrons : ( i ) a transition between the homogeneous bcs / bec phases at moderate temperatures ( nominally conventional , but with a gas of leftover neutrons in the low - density limit ) and ( ii ) a transition between the heterogeneous ps - bcs / ps - bec phases at low temperatures ( unconventional ) . by convention , boundaries between bcs ( or",

    "in this mini - review we have discussed some recent ( and not so recent ) advances toward the goal of a comprehensive understanding of the phase diagram of nuclear matter in the low - density regime below about half the saturation density of heavy nuclei . in this density region",
    "one may safely regard neutrons and protons as the basic constituents , interacting through two - nucleon potentials constrained by nucleon - nucleon scattering data and binding energies of light nuclei ( deuteron , triton , etc . ) .",
    "an _ ab initio _ many - body approach has been applied in a quantitative exploration of the temperature - density ( @xmath0 ) phase diagram of this apparently well - defined quantum many - body system @xcite , focusing ( a ) on its dependence upon isospin asymmetry and ( b ) simultaneously on the roles played by pairing and the bcs - bec crossover from cooper pairs to bound bosonic dimers ( deuterons ) .",
    "in addition to conventional bcs pairing , its competition with unconventional loff pairing ( in which the cooper pairs have finite total momentum ) has been treated in some detail .",
    "away from isospin symmetry , the heterogeneous phase which combines symmetrical superfluid and asymmetric normal matter may have lowest free energy . this possibility has been taken into consideration in the numerical calculations , with the finding that two - phase mixtures are favored over the homogeneous phases at the lowest temperatures and no - to - high density , where one of the components accommodates the excess neutrons .    the major portion of this review ( secs .  2 - 10 )",
    "has dealt with the @xmath0 phase diagram of dilute nuclear matter in its dependence on isospin . in secs .",
    "12 and 13 the focus has been shifted to another intriguing aspect of the nuclear - matter problem . restricting attention to pure neutron matter for simplicity ,",
    "this is the possibility of unconventional pairing involving the emergence of neutron dimers , i.e. , dineutrons , in some density range ( obviously not including @xmath266 ) . in turn",
    ", this eventuality raises the question of whether there is a corresponding bcs - bec transition in pure neutron matter .",
    "a very recent study carried out by some of us @xcite has a bearing on these issues .",
    "our initial study concentrated on the @xmath70-@xmath18 phase diagram of neutron matter including only homogeneous and isotropic phases indexed by a spin - polarization parameter .",
    "the resulting diagram resembles that of asymmetrical nuclear matter because of the analogy between nuclear matter at non - zero isospin asymmetry and pure neutron matter at non - zero spin asymmetry .",
    "an essential distinction between the phase diagrams of these systems stems from the fact that two neutrons are not bound in vacuum , whereas a neutron and a proton bind into the deuteron in free space .",
    "accordingly , pure neutron matter can not , in the strict sense , undergo a bcs - bec crossover from the @xmath6 bcs superfluid existing at higher densities , to a bec condensate of neutron dimers at asymptotically low density .",
    "the end state must be a neutron gas . nevertheless , the many - body calculations carried out recently by stein et al .",
    "@xcite give clear evidence of a bcs - bec _ precursor _ and thus confirm earlier findings of various authors obtained at zero spin polarization ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "the existence of a bcs - bec precursor is revealed , for example , by the attainment of cooper - pair correlation lengths comparable to the interparticle distance .",
    "this behavior must be attributed to the strongly resonant character of the @xmath267 interaction at low densities , where the @xmath6 component is dominant .",
    "this discourse impels us to ponder the content of secs .",
    "12 and 13 , which provide a schematic framework for understanding the emergence of unconventional types of pairing ( notably , a `` hidden dineutron state '' ) along with the conventional bcs solution . a systematic classification of such solutions is achieved in terms of two parameters : a familiar coupling parameter @xmath206 and a so - called stiffness parameter @xmath209 . as introduced",
    ", these parameters would be responsible for subsuming the effects of such complications relative to basic , bare - interaction nuclear bcs theory as ( i ) medium - induced corrections to the in - vacuum pairing interaction ( coming from exchange of density and spin - density fluctuations , for example ) and ( ii ) non - trivial momentum dependence of the resulting dressed interaction .",
    "( attention should also be given to self - energy corrections . )",
    "the first category of effects ( `` polarization corrections '' ) is absent in the many - body treatment underlying the results presented in secs .",
    "2 - 10 and in @xcite .",
    "the recent , seminal work of fan et al .",
    "@xcite does consistently incorporate such effects in a quantitatively precise _ ab initio _ many - body approach developed within correlated basis theory .",
    "this approach has been exhaustively applied in a study correlations in the low - density , strongly interacting fermi gas that addresses its fermi - liquid state and bcs pairing , as well as dimerization induced by phonon exchange .",
    "application of this method to neutron matter has the potential of resolving the fate of the dineutron , which may well depend ( perhaps counterintuitively ) on the hardness of the inner repulsion of the @xmath67 neutron - neutron interaction .",
