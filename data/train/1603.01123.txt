    "the magnetically doped zinc oxide holds a great promise for implementations in optoelectronic devices.@xcite as a member of a wide bandgap semiconductor family it is characterized by a small lattice constant , a possible large _ p - d _ hybridization , a small spin - orbit interaction , and a large exciton oscillator strength .",
    "these properties make zno based dilute magnetic semiconductors dmss highly attractive for room temperature applications.@xcite unique magnetic and magnetooptical properties have been already demonstrated , e.g. , for ( zn , co)o and ( zn , mn)o.@xcite ultra long spin coherence time ( @xmath5s ) found recently@xcite for fe@xmath2 ions in the zno indicates ( zn , fe)o as a highly promising spintronic system .",
    "systematic studies of magnetooptical properties of the zno doped with iron ions are , however , still missing .",
    "in particular , in the work of ando et al .",
    "( ref .  )",
    "magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) spectrum has been shown for the ( zn , fe)o , but no dependence on the magnetic field nor the iron charge state was determined . also , there is no literature record related to properties of near - the - band - gap photoluminescence ( pl ) of the ( zn , fe)o in magnetic field .    dopants of transition metal ions in ii - vi semiconductors natively exhibit the 2 + valency .",
    "in particular , 2 + valency was reported for the iron ions in cds , zns , cdse , znse , cdte and znte.@xcite in the case of zno the fe ions have been , however , observed in parallel in both valence states ( 2 + and 3+)@xcite or exclusively in 3 + state.@xcite    several contradictory mechanisms have been put forward for explanation of 3 + valency of iron in zno , like promotion of fe@xmath1 into the fe@xmath2 due to a compensation induced by zn vacancies,@xcite photoionization of the fe@xmath1 centers@xcite or a direct charge transfer from the ion to the conduction band@xcite . in parallel , the long spin coherence time@xcite suggests that the fe@xmath2 ions in zno are decoupled from their environment .",
    "thus , there are at least two questions that still need to be answered : ( i ) what is the valency of fe ions in zno ?",
    "( ii ) do the fe@xmath2 ions couple to band carriers through _ s , p - d _ exchange interaction ?    in this work ,",
    "we start with presenting the results of the density functional theory ( dft ) study of the electronic and magnetic properties of fe in zno .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation , together with the @xmath6 corrections considered as fitting parameters , are employed .",
    "calculations performed with @xmath0(fe ) larger than 3  ev show that the fe@xmath1 is a relatively shallow donor with the ( + /0 ) transition level in the upper part of the gap , and therefore the stable charge state of fe in ideal zno is the fe@xmath1 .",
    "the experimental ionization energy , around 0.25  ev , is reproduced with @xmath0(fe )  =  4  ev .",
    "the high energy of ( + /0 ) level relative to the valence band facilitates compensation of the fe@xmath1 to the fe@xmath2 by , e.g. , native acceptors because of the so - called fermi level effect .",
    "when @xmath0(fe ) lower than 3  ev is assumed , the donor level of the fe@xmath1 is degenerate with the conduction band , while that of the fe@xmath2 forms a gap state . in this case ,",
    "a correct description of the electronic structure of fe within gga is not possible , as discussed in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "finally , our calculations point toward non - zero values of _ s , p - d _ exchange constants in the ( zn , fe)o .    in the second part of the paper we provide a set of experimental results of magnetometry , conductivity and magnetooptical measurements on the ( zn , fe)o samples with the fe content attaining 0.2% .",
    "they confirm the theoretical findings .",
    "magnetometry results point toward 3 + valency of the fe ions .",
    "conductivity measurements reveal ionization energy of the fe ions around 0.25  ev .",

    "theoretical description of transition metal ( tm ) impurities in semiconductors represents a demanding test for electronic structure calculations for two reasons .",
    "the first one is that the local density approximation ( lda ) and gga to the dft severely underestimate the band gap , due to which the tm levels can be incorrectly predicted to form resonances degenerate with the conduction band continuum , rather than the experimentally observed states in the band gap .",
    "this error can lead to an erroneous charge state of a tm impurity , metallic rather than insulating crystal , spurious magnetic interactions between the dopants , etc .",
    "@xcite the second problem is related to a localized nature of the 3@xmath7 wave functions , for which many body effects can play an important role , requiring usage of approaches beyond lda / gga .",
    "this holds for both orbitals of host semiconductors and @xmath7(tm ) impurity orbitals . in the case of zno ,",
    "both lda and gga give a too small band gap @xmath8 of about 1.0  ev ,  @xcite and a too high energy of the @xmath7(zn)-derived bands relative to the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "@xcite    the hybrid functionals  @xcite and quasiparticle gw approaches  @xcite are more accurate methods to describe the band structure . however , as recently pointed out in ref .  , they improve mainly the band gap , while placing the @xmath7(zn ) band too high .",
    "consequently , lim _",
    "et al . _ applied an on - site potential for @xmath7(zn ) states during gw calculations to shift down the @xmath7(zn)-derived bands and hence to obtain full agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite    an alternative pseudoempirical approach consists in using gga supplemented by the @xmath6 corrections ,  @xcite which can be calculated e.g. by the linear response method  @xcite or can be treated as free parameters fitted to experimental data .",
    "the @xmath6 term applied to @xmath7(zn ) orbitals  @xcite greatly improves the position of @xmath7 bands , but hardly affects the band gap .",

    "@xcite the value of @xmath0(fe ) is considered as a free parameter varying from 0 to 6  ev .",
    "finally , the increase of the temperature from 0 to 300  k causes a change of the measured band gap by about 0.1  ev .",

    "red lines denote the band gap of zno .",
    "zero energy is set at the vbm .",
    "results are obtained with the 144-atom supercell for @xmath0(fe)=0 . ]    here we analyze electronic structure of fe in zno calculated assuming small @xmath0(fe ) , and show problems encountered within gga .",
    "the band structure and dos of zno doped with fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath1 is presented in fig .",
    "[ figa1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ figa1](b ) , respectively , for @xmath0(fe)@xmath99 .",
    "the impurity @xmath7(fe ) states constitute nearly flat bands , and their energies strongly depend on the fe charge state .",
    "fe@xmath2 introduces two spin - down states close to the cbm : the @xmath40 doublet is at 2.4  ev , and the @xmath41 triplet is very close to the cbm .",
    "both spin down levels are empty .",
    "addition of one electron to the zno : fe@xmath2 system should result in the @xmath28 charge state fe@xmath1 , with 6 electrons on the @xmath7(fe)-induced levels .",
    "however , this configuration can not be reached .",
    "the electronic structure for @xmath28 calculated allowing for fractional occupancies is shown in fig .",
    "[ figa1](b ) . in this case , the fe spin - down states are degenerate with the conduction band . in particular , the @xmath40 doublet is about 0.5  ev above cbm , and @xmath41 is higher by @xmath165  ev .",
    "therefore , the electron that should occupy @xmath40 autoionizes to the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that autoionization is partial only .",
    "in fact , the calculated occupancy of @xmath40 is 0.7 , and the integrated occupancy of the conduction states up to the fermi energy @xmath166 is 0.3 .",
    "one should notice that since there are no empty states below @xmath166 , @xmath166 must be located within the partially occupied @xmath40 level .",
    "this electronic configuration for @xmath28 , with partial occupation of @xmath40 , denoted as `` fe@xmath1 '' , is different from both the fe@xmath2 state , and from fe@xmath1 with one electron on @xmath40 .",
    "one should observe , however , that the results for `` fe@xmath1 '' are largely artefacts which follow from the employed method of calculations .",
    "more specifically , there are two issues : the increase of eigenenergies with increasing occupation , and applicability of partial occupations approach .",
    "first , the calculated increase of the kohn - sham energy of @xmath40 with its increasing occupation is related to the spurious self - interaction obtained in the approximate versions of dft . within the exact dft ,",
    "a kohn - sham energy level is independent of its fractional occupation , while an integer change of occupation induces its jump .",
    "indeed , a change of the charge state of a defect due to a capture ( emission ) of an electron implies an increased ( decreased ) coulomb repulsion between electrons situated at the relevant orbitals ( @xmath7 orbitals of a transition metal ion , broken bonds of vacancy neighbors , etc . ) .",
    "this is reflected in the increasing energies of transition levels for consecutive charge states , together with the increasing kohn - sham eigenenergies of defect - induced states .",
    "this is a genuine physical effect , which can be described by the so - called effective @xmath0 parameter , and calculated within dft  @xcite for integer occupancies .",
    "second , the final result for `` fe@xmath1 '' with one electron shared between @xmath7(fe ) and cbm should not be accepted because such a partition is not physical in the present case of an isolated defect center in an insulator .    in other words ,",
    "the @xmath167 configuration of fe@xmath1 is not stable since @xmath40 occupied with one electron is above the ( empty ) cbm ,  @xcite similar to a resonant donor .",
    "however , a complete autoionization to the @xmath32 charge state can not occur because the empty @xmath40 is below the ( occupied ) cbm .",
    "neither case corresponds to the ground state , and the convergent self - consistent solution is only obtained for fractional occupation of the @xmath40 level .",
    "these problems with `` fe@xmath1 '' in zno are analogous to the difficulties encountered for isolated transition metal atoms such as fe .",
    "@xcite namely , the self - consistent solution for @xmath168 configuration leads to an empty @xmath9 state below the partially filled @xmath7 states , while in the @xmath169 configuration there are empty @xmath7 states below the @xmath9 level .",
    "the energy minimum is obtained for fractional occupations of both @xmath7 and @xmath9 , but , as indicated by janak ,  @xcite `` in a strict interpretation of the kohn - sham theory , this means that there is no charge density for this problem which minimizes the total energy and which is generated from a fermi distribution . ''    the electronic structure of the neutral fe in zno calculated in refs   is characterized by @xmath166 in the conduction band , and partially filled @xmath40 , which closely resembles the `` fe@xmath1 '' configuration . clearly , without a detailed inspection of the results it is not possible to assess the genuine resonant ( or the `` pseudo - resonant '' ) character of fe found in those works but , given the similarity to `` fe@xmath1 '' , one may expect that the above discussion may be relevant in some of those cases ."
