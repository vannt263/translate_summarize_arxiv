    "as is the case for polar semiconductors and ionic crystals @xcite , insight into the nature of polarons in high - temperature superconductors can be gained by studying the optical properties of these materials .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to present a theory of the optical conductivity of a system of continuum polarons at any density , including many - body effects between the constituent charge carriers , for small and intermediate values of the electron - phonon coupling constant and for zero temperature .",
    "the method we develop here is based on the variational method introduced by lemmens , devreese , brosens ( ldb ) @xcite for the ground state energy of the many - polaron gas .",
    "the advantage of this approach over other theories of many - polaron optical absorption @xcite  is that it allows to include the many - body effects in the system of the constituent charge carriers of the polaron gas on the level of the dynamical structure factor of the underlying electron ( or hole ) system .",
    "thus it is possible to select the level of approximation used in the treatment of the many - polaron gas by choosing the appropriate expression of the dynamical structure factor for the _ electron _ ( or hole ) system .",
    "recently the infrared spectrum of cuprates has been the subject of intensive investigations @xcite , especially in the case of the neodymium - cerium cuprate family nd@xmath1ce@xmath4cuo@xmath3 ( ncco ) @xcite .",
    "several optical absorption features in the infrared cuprate spectrum have been tentatively associated with large polarons @xcite or with a mixture of large and small ( bi)polarons @xcite .",
    "these comparisons with polaron theory were derived using a single - polaron picture , so that the density ( doping ) dependence of the optical absorption spectra could not be studied in detail .",
    "the many - body theory of the @xmath5-polaron spectrum , presented here , allows to study the density ( doping ) dependence of optical absorption spectra . as a first application of the many - polaron optical absorption theory introduced here",
    ", a preliminary comparison is presented between the theoretical many - polaron optical absorption derived in the current work and the mid - infrared spectrum of the neodymium - cerium cuprates recently determined experimentally by calvani and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a system of @xmath5 interacting continuum polarons is given by :    @xmath6 + \\frac{e^{2}}{2\\varepsilon _ { \\infty } } % \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{\\ell ( \\neq j)=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{|{\\bf r}_{i}-{\\bf r}_{j}| } , \\label{hmpol}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 represent the position and momentum of the @xmath8 constituent electrons ( or holes ) with band mass @xmath9 ; @xmath10 denote the creation and annihilation operators for longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons with wave vector @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 ; @xmath13 describes the amplitude of the interaction between the electrons and the phonons ; and @xmath14 is the elementary electron charge .",
    "the ground state energy of this many - polaron hamiltonian has been studied before by ldb @xcite , for weak and intermediate strengths of the electron - phonon coupling , by introducing a variational wave function : @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the ground - state many - body wave function for the electron ( or hole ) system and @xmath17 is the phonon vacuum , and @xmath18 is a many - body unitary operator which determines a canonical transformation for a fermion gas interacting with a boson field : @xmath19 in the limit of one fermion , @xmath18  reduces to a canonical transformation inspired by tomonaga @xcite and applied later by several workers , after lee , low and pines @xcite , but always for one particle - theories . in ldb @xcite , this canonical transformation was extended and used to establish a many - fermion theory .",

    ", @xmath23 represents the static structure factor of the constituent interacting many electron or hole system : @xmath24 the angular brackets @xmath25  represent the expectation value with respect to the ground state .",
    "it may be emphasized that ( [ u ] ) , although it appears like a straightforward generalization of the one - particle transformation in @xcite , represents  -especially in its implementation- a nontrivial extension of a one - particle approximation to a many - body system .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the main advantage of the ldb many - polaron variational approach lies in the fact that the many - body effects in the system of charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) are completely contained in the structure factor of the electron ( or hole ) gas .",
    "this advantage will be carried through into the calculation of the optical properties of the interacting gas of continuum polarons which is the subject of the current paper .",

    "this applied electric field introduces a perturbation term in the hamiltonian ( [ hmpol ] ) , which couples the vector potential of the incident electromagnetic field to the current - density . as is well known , within linear response theory , the optical conductivity can be expressed through the kubo formula as a current - current correlation function @xcite : @xmath28 \\right\\rangle dt.\\ ] ] in this expression , v is the volume of the system , and @xmath29 is the @xmath26-component of the current operator @xmath30 which is related to the momentum operators of the charge carriers : @xmath31 with @xmath32 the charge of the charge carriers ( @xmath33 for holes , @xmath34 for electrons ) and @xmath35 the total momentum operator of the charge carriers . the real part of the optical conductivity at temperature zero , which is proportional to the optical absorption coefficient , can be written as a function of the total momentum operator of the charge carriers as follows : @xmath36=\\frac{1}{\\text{v}\\hbar \\omega } \\frac{e^{2}}{m_{b}^{2}}% % tcimacro{\\func{re}}% % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\rm re}% % endexpansion \\left\\ { \\int_{0}^{\\infty } e^{i\\omega t}\\left\\langle \\left [ p_{x}(t),p_{x}(0)% \\right ] \\right\\rangle dt\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] integrating by parts twice , the real part of the optical conductivity of the many - polaron system can be written with a force - force correlation function : @xmath36=\\frac{1}{\\text{v}\\hbar \\omega ^{3}}\\frac{e^{2}}{m_{b}^{2}}% % tcimacro{\\func{re}}% % beginexpansion \\mathop{\\rm re}% % endexpansion \\left\\ { \\int_{0}^{\\infty } e^{i\\omega t}\\left\\langle \\left [ f_{x}(t),f_{x}(0)% \\right ] \\right\\rangle dt\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] with @xmath37 $ ] .",

    "a comparison of this experimental normalized first frequency moment to the theoretical one presents the advantage that fewer parameters need to be adapted : only the _ density _ and the electron _ band mass _ have to be taken from experiment or ( if experimental values are lacking ) fitted .",

    "5 . for the four remaining samples @xmath135 a discrepancy between",

    "it has been observed experimentally that the weight of the low - frequency component in these samples ( with @xmath136 ) is significantly larger that the corresponding weight in samples with @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted in @xcite as a consequence of an _ insulator - to - metal _ transition taking place around the cerium - doping level of @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that above this doping level @xmath26 a change in the nature of the charge carriers takes place .",
    "one could hypothesize that , as the formation of bipolarons is stabilized with increasing density of the polaron gas @xcite , bipolarons start playing a role in the optical absorption spectrum . in a variety of other cuprates and manganates ,",

    "therefore , the many - body effects in the electron ( hole ) system can be taken into account by employing any desired approximation to the dielectric response ( hartree - fock , rpa , etc . ) of this electron ( hole ) system .    in the present work , the dynamical structure factor @xmath138 of the electron ( or hole ) gas was considered both in the hartree - fock and the rpa approximation",
    "the main effect of the pauli exclusion principle on the optical absorption of the polaron gas turns out to be a shift of the oscillator strength towards higher frequencies .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of the available initial and final states in the polaron - photon scattering process and naturally invokes the fermi energy @xmath80  of the electron ( hole ) gas .",
    "the main effects in the case of the rpa approximation are an overall reduction of the optical absorption at frequencies @xmath139  and the introduction of a novel absorption feature which we identified as a plasmon - phonon peak .",
    "this plasmon - phonon peak shifts to higher frequencies with increasing density , such that a double peak structure can appear in the 3d many - polaron optical absorption spectrum , consistent with the observed bimodal polaronic band in cadmium oxide @xcite .",
