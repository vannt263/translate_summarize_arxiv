    "the dynamical origin of resonances in @xmath6 scattering has been a recurrent subject in low energy particle physics @xcite .",
    "analyticity , unitarity , crossing and chiral symmetry have provided main insights into this subject .",
    "it is well known that so far no solution is available exactly fulfilling all these requirements . in practical calculations",
    "some of the properties mentioned above have to be given up .",
    "standard chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) furnishes exact crossing and restores unitarity order by order in the chiral expansion . in typical calculations the unitarity limit is reached at about a center of mass ( cm ) energy @xmath7 mev is the pion mass , for which we take 139.57 mev , and @xmath8 the pion decay constant , for which we take 93.2 mev . ] still a low scale compared to the known resonances . simply because of",
    "this reason standard chpt is unable to describe the physically observed resonances , namely the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 .",
    "but even if the unitarity limit was much larger , and thus resonances would appear at significantly smaller scales than it , standard chpt would be unable to generate them since its applicability requires the existence of a gap between the pion states and the hadronic states next in energy , which for @xmath6 scattering are precisely the resonances .",
    "resonances clearly indicate the presence of non perturbative physics , and thus a pole on the second riemann sheet ( signal of the resonance ) can not be obtained in perturbation theory to finite order .",
    "hence , the energy regime for which chpt holds has to satisfy @xmath11 regardless of the unitarity limit .",
    "it so happens that both the resonances and the unitarity limit lead to similar scales , but there is so far no compelling reason to ascribe this coincidence to some underlying dynamical feature or symmetry limit where @xmath12 but @xmath13 and @xmath14 , so in this limit @xmath15 , which suggests a possible scenario where resonances can appear well below the unitarity limit . ] .",
    "the desire to describe resonances using standard chpt as a guide has led some authors to propose several approaches which favor some of the properties , that the exact scattering amplitude should satisfy , respect to others .",
    "thus , pade re - summation ( pr )  @xcite , large @xmath16expansion ( lne )  @xcite , inverse amplitude method ( iam )  @xcite , current algebra unitarization ( cau )  @xcite , dispersion relations ( dp )  @xcite , roy equations  @xcite , coupled channel lippmann - schwinger approach ( ccls )  @xcite and hybrid approaches  @xcite have been suggested .",
    "besides their advantages and success to describe the data in the low - lying resonance region , any of them has specific drawbacks . in all above approaches except by lne and ccls",
    "it is not clear which is the chpt series of diagrams which has been summed up .",
    "this is not the case for the ccls approach , but there a three momentum cut - off is introduced , hence breaking translational lorentz invariance and therefore the scattering amplitude can be only evaluated in the the cm frame . on the other hand , though the lne and cau approaches preserve crossing symmetry , both of them violate unitarity . likewise , those approaches which preserve exact unitarity violate crossing symmetry .",
    "a clear advantage of maintaining elastic unitarity lies in the unambiguous identification of the phase shifts .",
    "this is particularly useful to describe resonances since the modulus of the partial wave amplitude reaches at the resonant energy the maximum value allowed by unitarity . on the other hand , a traditional objection to any unitarization scheme",
    "is provided by the non - uniqueness of the procedure ; this ambiguity is related to our lack of knowledge of an appropriate expansion parameter for resonant energy physics .",
    "this drawback does not invalidate the systematics and predictive power of unitarization methods , although it is true that improvement has a different meaning for different schemes .",
    "in addition , unitarization by itself is not sufficient to predict a resonance , some methods work while others do not . against unitarization",
    "it is also argued that since crossing symmetry is violated , the connection to a lagrangian framework is lost , and hence there is no predictive power for other processes in terms of a few phenomenological constants .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) provides a natural framework beyond perturbation theory to treat the relativistic two body problem from a quantum field theory ( qft ) point of view  @xcite .",
    "this approach allows to treat both the study of the scattering and of the bound state properties of the system .",
    "in practical applications , however , approximations have to be introduced which , generally speaking , violate some known properties of the underlying qft .",
    "this failure only reflects our in - capability of guessing the exact solution .",
    "the problem with the truncations is that almost always the micro - causality requirement is lost , and hence the local character of the theory . as a consequence , properties directly related to locality such as cpt , crossing and related ones are not exactly satisfied",
    "this has led some authors to use the less stringent framework of relativistic quantum mechanics as a basis to formulate the few body problem  @xcite .",
    "it would be , of course , of indubitable interest the formulation of a chiral expansion within such a framework .    despite of these problems , even at the lowest order approximation , or ladder approximation ,",
    "the bse sums an infinite set of diagrams , allowing for a manifest implementation of elastic unitarity .",
    "this is certainly very relevant in the scattering region and more specifically if one aims to describe resonances , as we have discussed above . at",
    "higher orders , to implement unitarity one needs to include inelastic processes due to particle production ( @xmath17 , @xmath18,@xmath19 ) .    in general ,",
    "the renormalization of the bse is a difficult problem for qft s in the continuum .",
    "the complications arise because typical local features , i.e. properties depending on micro - causality , like crossing are broken by the approximate nature of the solution .",
    "this means that there is no a renormalized lagrangian which _ exactly _ reproduces the amplitude , but only up to the approximate level of the solution .",
    "this is the price payed for manifest unitarity .",
    "fortunately , from the point of view of the effective field theory ( eft ) idea , this problem can be tackled in a manageable and analytical way .",
    "since this is a low energy expansion in terms of the appropriate relevant degrees of freedom , interactions are suppressed in powers of momentum and thus the bse equation can be solved and renormalized explicitly by expanding the iterated two particle irreducible amplitude in a power series of momentum .",
    "this requires the introduction of a finite number of counter - terms for a given order in the expansion .",
    "the higher the order in this expansion , the larger the number of parameters , and thus the predictive power of the expansion diminishes .",
    "thus an acceptable compromise between predictive power and degree of accuracy has to be reached . within the bse such a program , although possible , has the unpleasant feature of arbitrariness in the renormalization scheme , although this is also the case in standard chpt .    in this paper",
    "we study the scattering of pseudoscalar mesons by means of the bse in the context of chpt .",
    "most useful information can be extracted from chiral symmetry , which dictates the energy dependence of the scattering amplitude as a power series expansion of @xmath20 .",
    "the unknown coefficients of the expansion increase with the order . by using the bse",
    "we can also predict the energy dependence of the scattering amplitude in terms of unknown coefficients and in agreement with the unitarity requirement .",
    "this can be done in a way to comply with the known behavior in chpt .",
    "one important outcome of our calculation is the justification of several methods based on algebraic manipulations of the on - shell scattering amplitude , and which make no reference to the set of diagrams which are summed up .",
    "moreover , some off - shell quantities are obtained .",
    "although it is true that physical quantities only make sense when going to the mass shell there is no doubt that off - shell quantities do enter into few body calculations .    among others ,",
    "the main results of the present investigation are the following ones :    * a quantitative accurate description of both pion form factors and @xmath6 elastic scattering amplitudes is achieved in an energy region wider than the one in which chpt works .",
    "we implement exact elastic unitarity whereas crossing symmetry is perturbatively restored . for the form factors ,",
    "the approach presented here automatically satisfies watson s theorem and it goes beyond the leading order omns representation which is traditionally used . * a meticulous error treatment is undertaken .",
    "our investigations on the pion electric form factor together with our statistical and systematic error analysis provide a very accurate determination of some of the chpt @xmath2low energy parameters , @xmath21 * the current approach reproduces chpt to one loop . however and mainly due to the precise determination of the difference @xmath22 quoted above , our one loop results have much smaller errors than most of the previously published ones . as a consequence ,",
    "we generate some of the two - loop corrections more precisely than recent two loop calculations do . *",
    "the present framework allows for an improvement of any computed order of chpt .",

    "this is a common problem in all unitarization schemes . in the bse",

    "@xmath40 , containing @xmath27 and @xmath26channel loop contributions , is used .    actually , in our treatment of the channels @xmath124 we require @xmath125 undetermined constants independent of each other in each isospin channel . ] , whereas crossing imposes to order @xmath126 only 4 , namely @xmath127 .",
    "this is not as severe as one might think since we are summing up an infinite series in @xmath119 .",
    "nevertheless , we will show below how this information on crossing can be implemented at the level of partial waves .      to renormalize the on - shell amplitudes given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i_0]),([eq : i_1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : i_2 ] ) , or the corresponding ones for the case of off - shell scattering , we note that in the spirit of an eft all possible counter - terms should be considered .",
    "this can be achieved in our case in a perturbative manner , making use of the formal expansion of the bare amplitude @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the two particle propagator .",
    "thus , a counter - term series should be added to the bare amplitude such that the sum of both becomes finite . at each order in the perturbative expansion ,",
    "the divergent part of the counter - term series is completely determined .",

    "our renormalization scheme is such that the renormalized amplitude can be cast , again , as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i_0]),([eq : i_1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : i_2 ] ) .",

    "therefore the renormalized amplitude can be expressed in terms of physical ( measurable ) magnitudes . in principle , these quantities should be understood in terms of the underlying qcd dynamics , but in practice it seems more convenient so far to fit @xmath132 to the available data .",
    "the threshold properties of the amplitude ( scattering length , effective range , etc .. ) can then be determined from them .",
    "besides the pion properties @xmath28 and @xmath8 , at this order in the expansion we have 8 parameters .",
    "the appearance of 8 new parameters is not surprising because the highest divergence we find is quartic ( @xmath100 ) for the channels @xmath110 and @xmath111 and quadratic ( @xmath99 ) for the isovector channel and therefore to make the amplitudes convergent we need to perform 3 + 3 + 2 subtractions respectively .",
    "this situation is similar to what happens in standard chpt where one needs to include low - energy parameters ( @xmath133 s ) .",

    "such a comparison will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "this renormalization scheme leads to a renormalized amplitude which does not derive from a renormalized lagrangian .",

    "[ sec : appea1 ] of the appendix  [ sec : appea ] .",

    "nevertheless , by imposing suitable constraints on our parameters we can fulfill crossing symmetry approximately .",
    "we do this at the level of partial wave amplitudes . for completeness , we reproduce here a discussion from ref .",
    "@xcite , where this issue was first addressed . at the lowest order in the chiral expansion proposed in this section , we approximate , in the scattering region @xmath120 , the @xmath137 @xmath27 and @xmath26 channel unitarity corrections ( function @xmath138 in eq .",

    "thus , the analytical structure of the amplitude derived from the left hand cut is only recovered perturbatively .",
    "this is in common to other approaches ( pr , dp , iam @xmath19 ) fulfilling exact unitarity in the @xmath144-channel , as discussed in  @xcite ,  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , this approach violates crossing symmetry . at order @xmath137 our isoscalar @xmath0 , isovector @xmath106 and isotensor @xmath0wave amplitudes are polynomials of degree two in the variable @xmath145 , with a total of eight ( 3 + 2 + 3 ) arbitrary coefficients ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 ) , and there are no logarithmic corrections to account for @xmath27 and @xmath26channel unitarity corrections .",

    "we have dealt with the issue of renormalizability of the bse within the framework of chpt .",
    "we have recognized two alternative extreme viewpoints to implement the renormalization program which we have named : off - shell and on - shell schemes .    in the off - shell scheme , the off - shell dependence of the potential is kept while solving the bse .",
    "this way of proceeding allows to choose a renormalization scheme where the finite parts of the ultraviolet power divergences are not set to zero .",
    "this , still , produces more constants than those allowed by crossing at a given order in the chiral expansion , and it becomes sensible to fine tune them in a way to comply as best as we can with the crossing symmetry requirement . in practice",
    "we have found it convenient to implement this as a restriction on our partial wave amplitudes by matching those to taylor expansions of the chpt ones , including the contribution of the left hand cut .",

    "this approach , although very efficient to describe the data in the different isospin channels , becomes very cumbersome to pursue at next to leading order .",
    "thus , we have also considered the on - shell scheme . as discussed in the paper ,",
    "the fact that we are dealing with an eft provides interesting insight into the problem .",
    "given the infinite number of counter - terms necessary to ensure the renormalizability of the theory in a broad sense , one can reorganize the summation of diagrams in a way as to include in the potential the unknown coefficients . as an important consequence ,",
    "a dramatic simplification in the solution of the bse arises : all the divergences originated by the off - shell behavior of the potential can be effectively renormalized by redefining the potential and simultaneously ignoring the off - shellness in the solution of the bse .",
    "in particular , on shell information for the full scattering amplitude can simply be obtained from the on - shell potential with unknown coefficients .",
    "we have found the on - shell scheme more convenient to take advantage of the chpt information to one and two loops than the off - shell scheme .",
    "eventually , both schemes would become equivalent if the _ exact _ amplitude were considered .    in particular , by using the on - shell scheme we have constructed a @xmath6 amplitude , which exactly reproduces the tree plus one loop scattering amplitude of chpt and embodies exact elastic unitarity to all orders in the chiral expansion parameter @xmath270 .",
    "thus , the definition of the phase shifts is unambiguous .",

    "we have been able to make a very accurate determination , in terms of estimated errors , of some low energy parameters . in particular ,",
    "a remarkably accurate prediction has been achieved for the difference @xmath306 and the parameter @xmath25 by fitting the vector form factor , rather than the @xmath6 scattering amplitude in the vector - isovector channel .",
    "predictions for the corresponding @xmath307 phase shift with the propagated errors are satisfactory and accurate from threshold up to 1200 mev .",
    "similar features are also found for other channels , although there the maximum energy , for which the predictions with their error - bars apply , ranges from 600 mev in the scalar - isoscalar , to 1400 mev in the scalar - isotensor channel .",
