    "this work is dedicated to the study of a bi - fluidic system which consists in two layers of homogeneous , immiscible , ideal and incompressible fluids under only the external influence of gravity .",
    "such a configuration is commonly used in oceanography , where variations of temperature and salinity induce a density stratification ; see  @xcite and references therein .    a striking property of the above setting",
    ", in contrast with the water - wave case ( namely only one layer of homogeneous fluid with a free surface ) is that the cauchy problem for the governing equations is ill - posed outside of the analytic framework when surface tension is neglected  @xcite .",
    "this ill - posedness is caused by the formation of high - frequency ( _ i.e. _  small wavelength ) kelvin - helmholtz instabilities which are triggered by any non - trivial velocity shear .",
    "recently , lannes  @xcite showed that a small amount of surface tension is sufficient to durably regularize the high - frequency component of the flow , while the main low - frequency component remains mostly unaffected .",
    "this result explains why , occasionally , surface tension may be harmlessly neglected in asymptotic models , that is simplified models constructed from smallness assumptions on physical properties of the flow .",
    "this is typically expected to be the case for models derived in the so - called shallow - water regime , which implies that the main component of the flow is located at low frequencies ; and in particular for the two - layer extension of the classical green - naghdi model introduced by miyata  @xcite , maltseva  @xcite and choi and camassa  @xcite . however , as noticed in  @xcite a linear stability analysis indicates that the bi - fluidic green - naghdi system actually overestimates kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , in the sense that the threshold on the velocity shear above which high - frequency instabilities are triggered is always smaller for the model than for the full euler system .",
    "many attempts have been made in order to `` regularize '' the green - naghdi model , that is proposing new models with formally the same precision as the original model , but which are not subject to high - frequency kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , even without surface tension  @xcite .",
    "the strategies adopted in these works rely on change of unknowns and/or benjamin - bona - mahony type tricks ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5.2 ) for a thorough presentation of such methods in the water - wave setting . in this work",
    ", we present a new class of modified green - naghdi systems obtained through a different , somewhat simpler mean .",
    "we find numerous advantages in our method :    * the original green - naghdi model is only lightly modified , and the physical interpretations of variables and identities of the original model are preserved . *",
    "the method is quite flexible .",
    "it allows in particular to construct models which completely suppress large - frequency kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ; or a model which conforms perfectly with the linear stability analysis of the full euler system . *",
    "the rich structure of the original green - naghdi system ( hamiltonian formulation , groups of symmetry , conserved quantities ) is maintained . this is generally not the case when change of unknowns or bbm tricks are involved ; see discussion in  @xcite .",
    "our models may be viewed as green - naghdi systems with improved frequency dispersion .",
    "in particular , one of our models shares with full dispersion models such as in  @xcite the property that their dispersion relation is the same as the one of the full euler system .",
    "notice however that , consistently with the derivation of the original green - naghdi model and contrarily to the aforementioned ones , our models do not rely on an assumption of small amplitude : we only assume that the wavelength is large compared with the depth of the two layers ( see the consistency result given in proposition  [ p.consistency ] ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there does not exist any other model in the literature with such properties , even when only one layer of fluid is involved .",
    "a noteworthy feature of our models is that , by construction , they involve non - local operators ( fourier multipliers ) . such operators are common in deep - water models or small - amplitude models , such as the benjamin - ono or whitham equations for instance , but appear to be original in the shallow - water setting .",
    "our new class of models is obtained by regularizing the original green - naghdi one and not from a direct derivation from the full euler system . as it is made clear in section  [ s.hamiltonian ] , below",
    ", we could also derive our models from hamilton s principle , but once again our approximate hamiltonian functional consists only in a harmless perturbation of the original green - naghdi one .",
    "it would be interesting to derive our models directly from an expansion of the so - called dirichlet - neumann operators , and investigate whether the full dispersion model is more precise than the original one when only small nonlinearities are involved .",
    "we also acknowledge that the use of surface tension in view of modeling miscible fluids of different densities , such as water and brine , is arguable .",
    "we view surface tension as a simple and effective way of regularizing the flow .",
    "let us point out that the construction of our new models does not rely on any particular structure of the surface tension component , thus could be applied with any additive regularizing term .",
    "our systems may be more evidently applicable to two - layer systems of genuinely immiscible , homogeneous and inviscid fluids .",
    "we believe they may also be of interest in the situation of one layer of homogeneous fluid , with or without surface tension .    for the sake of simplicity , our study is restricted to the setting of a flat bottom , rigid lid and one - dimensional horizontal variable .",
    "the construction of our models , however , may straightforwardly be extended to the two - dimensional case .",
    "we also expect that our strategy can be favorably applied to more general configurations ( non - trivial topography , free surface , multi - layer , _ etc . _ )    in the present work , we motivate our models through the study of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , by linearizing the systems around solutions with constant shear .",
    "this formal study is supported by numerical simulations , which demonstrate how the predictions of the modified green - naghdi models may vary dramatically depending on their large - frequency dispersion properties , and the significant influence of small surface tension .",
    "we also provide a rigorous analysis for a class of our models by proving the well - posedness of the cauchy problem as well as consistency and stability results , which together offer the full justification of our asymptotic models , in the sense described in  @xcite .",
    "this includes the original green - naghdi model as well as the saint - venant ( hydrostatic shallow - water ) system with surface tension , for one or two layers of fluid ; all these results being original as far as we know .      for the sake of completeness and in order to fix the notations",
    ", we briefly recall the governing equations of a two - layer flow in our configuration , that we call _ full euler system_. we let the interested reader refer to  @xcite for more details .",
    "the setting consists in two layers ( infinite in the horizontal variable , vertically delimited by a flat rigid lid and a flat bottom ) of immiscible , homogeneous , ideal , incompressible and irrotational fluid under only the external influence of gravity .",
    "we assume that the interface between the two layers is given as the graph of a function , @xmath1 , so that the domain of the two fluids at time @xmath2 is @xmath3 here and thereafter , the subscript @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) always refer to the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) layer .",
    "the fluids being irrotational , we consider the velocity potentials in each layer , that we denote @xmath6 .",
    "finally , @xmath7 denotes the pressure inside each layer .",
    "let @xmath8 be the maximum amplitude of the deformation of the interface .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 a characteristic horizontal length , say the wavelength of the interface .",
    "the celerity of infinitely long and small internal waves is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) is the depth of the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) layer and @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) its mass density .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the acceleration of gravity .",
    "consequently , we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath16 the dimensionless unknowns @xmath17 as well as the following dimensionless parameters @xmath18 the last parameter is the bond number , and measures the ratio of gravity forces over capillary forces ( @xmath19 is the surface tension coefficient ) . after applying the above scaling , but withdrawing the tildes for the sake of readability , the system may be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , + @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    we may conveniently rewrite the above system as two evolution equations , thanks to the use of dirichlet - neumann operators . in order to do so , we define @xmath25 , and @xmath26\\psi { \\stackrel{\\rm def}{=}}\\sqrt{1+\\mu|\\epsilon\\partial_x\\zeta|^2}\\big(\\partial_n \\phi_1 \\big){\\left\\vert_{_{z=\\epsilon\\zeta}}\\right . }",

    "let us now present our new class of models , which aim at describing the flow in the situation where the shallowness parameter is small : @xmath31 our systems use layer - averaged horizontal velocities as unknowns , that is defining @xmath32 here and thereafter , @xmath33 ( resp .",

    "furthermore , we fully justify system   for a class of fourier multipliers including all of the three examples above , in the sense that for sufficiently small and regular initial data , the model admits a unique strong solution which is proved to be close ( when @xmath72 ) to the solution of the full euler system with corresponding initial data .",
    "however , only for the latter two examples is the smallness assumption ensuring the stability of the flow , by preventing the appearance of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , consistent with the one of the full euler system .",
    "the precise statements of these results are displayed in section  [ s.justification ] .",
    "some elementary properties of our models are studied in section  [ s.preliminaires ] .",

    "in section  [ s.kh ] , we recall the linear analysis of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities for the full euler system , and extend the study to our models .",
    "in particular , we recover that the classical green - naghdi model overestimates kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , whereas our modified model with the choice @xmath73 recovers perfectly the behavior of the full euler system .",
    "section  [ s.numerics ] is dedicated to numerical illustrations of this phenomenon .",
    "we give two examples ( with and without surface tension ) where the original , improved and regularized green - naghdi models predict very different behavior .",

    "we first prove that the cauchy problem for system   with sufficiently regular initial data is well - posed under some hyperbolicity conditions . roughly speaking ,",
    "we show that provided a dimensionless parameter which depends on the large frequency behavior of @xmath74 is sufficiently small , our system is well - posed for sufficiently regular and bounded initial data , on a time interval uniform with respect to compact sets of parameters ; see theorem  [ t.wp ] for details .",
    "we then supplement this result with consistency ( proposition  [ p.consistency ] ) and stability ( proposition  [ p.stability ] ) results , which together offer the full justification of our models ( proposition  [ p.justification ] ) .",
    "finally , we present in section  [ s.sv ] some improved results in the limiting case @xmath75 , that is on the so - called saint - venant , or shallow - water system ( with surface tension ) .",
    "appendix  [ s.functional ] is dedicated to the detailed presentation of our functional setting and some notations ; and appendix  [ s.proof ] provides the proof of our main result , theorem  [ t.wp ] .",
    "it is known since the seminal work of zakharov  @xcite that the full euler system ( with one layer ) admits a hamiltonian structure .",
    "this hamiltonian structure has been extended to the two - layer case in  @xcite .",
    "we show in section  [ s.hamiltonian ] that our models  both under the form  - and    also admit a hamiltonian structure , so that our models could be derived from hamilton s principle on an approximate lagrangian .",

    "the main difference with respect to the traditional methods for quasilinear systems is that we treat time derivatives in the same way as space derivatives .",
    "in particular , the main tool of the analysis is the control of a _ space - time _ energy .",
    "the reason for such a strategy is that    * the two unknowns , @xmath203 and @xmath205 , are controlled in different functional spaces , one being continuously embedded in the other but to the price of a non - uniform constant ( see lemma  [ l.embedding ] ) , and the inclusion being strict ; * the most singular term of the system , namely the one which involves the operator of highest order , comes from the surface tension component , and couples the two unknowns ( it appears as an off - diagonal component of the quasilinearized system ) .      more precisely , our strategy is as follows . in lemma  [ l.linearize ] below , we `` quasilinearize '' the system .",
    "we differentiate several times the equations with respect to space and time , and extract the leading order components .",
    "the quasilinear system we consider is the complete system of all the equations satisfied by the original unknowns and their space - time derivatives up to sufficiently high order .",

    "<S> we introduce a new class of green - naghdi type models for the propagation of internal waves between two ( @xmath0)-dimensional layers of homogeneous , immiscible , ideal , incompressible , irrotational fluids , vertically delimited by a flat bottom and a rigid lid . </S>",
    "<S> these models are tailored to improve the frequency dispersion of the original bi - layer green - naghdi model , and in particular to manage high - frequency kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , while maintaining its precision in the sense of consistency . </S>",
    "<S> our models preserve the hamiltonian structure , symmetry groups and conserved quantities of the original model . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a rigorous justification of a class of our models thanks to consistency , well - posedness and stability results . </S>",
    "<S> these results apply in particular to the original green - naghdi model as well as to the saint - venant ( hydrostatic shallow - water ) system with surface tension . </S>"
