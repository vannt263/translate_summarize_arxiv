    "modern wireless communication systems , e.g. , cellular networks and wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) , are featured by larger bandwidth , higher data rate and lower communication delays . the improvement on communication quality and the increased data processing complexity have imposed higher requirement on the quality of power supply to wireless devices ( wds ) .",
    "conventionally , wds are powered by batteries , which have to be replaced / recharged manually once the energy is depleted .",
    "alternatively , the recent advance of radio frequency ( rf ) enabled wireless power transfer ( wpt ) provides an attractive solution to power wds over the air @xcite .",
    "by leveraging the far - field radiative properties of microwave , wds can harvest energy remotely from the rf signals radiated by the dedicated energy nodes ( ens ) @xcite .",
    "compared to the conventional battery - powered methods , wpt can save the cost due to manual battery replacement / recharging in many applications , and also improve the network performance by reducing energy outages of wds .",
    "currently , tens of microwatts ( @xmath0w ) rf power can be effectively transferred to a distance of more than @xmath1 meters .",
    "meters is about @xmath2w . ]",
    "the energy is sufficient to power the activities of many low - power communication devices , such as sensors and rf identification ( rfid ) tags . in the future",
    ", we expect more practical applications of rf - enabled wpt to wireless communications thanks to the rapid developments of many performance enhancing technologies , such as energy beamforming with multiple antennas @xcite and more efficient energy harvesting circuit designs @xcite .    in a wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) , the operations of wds , including data transmissions , are fully / partially powered by means of rf - enabled wpt @xcite . a tdma ( time division multiple access ) based protocol for wpcn is first proposed in @xcite , where the wds harvest rf energy broadcasted from a hybrid access point ( hap ) in the first time slot , and then use the harvested energy to transmit data back to the hap in the second time slot .",
    "later , @xcite extends the single - antenna hap in @xcite to a multi - antenna hap that enables more efficient energy transmission via energy beamforming as well as more spectrally efficient sdma ( space division multiple access ) based information transmission as compared to tdma . to further improve the spectral efficiency",
    ", @xcite considers using full - duplex hap in wpcns , where a hap can transmit energy and receive user data simultaneously via advanced self - interference cancelation techniques . intuitively , using a hap ( or co - located en and information ap ) , instead of two separated en and information access point ( ap ) , to provide information and",
    "energy access is an economic way to save deployment cost , and the energy and information transmissions in the network can also be more efficiently coordinated by the hap .",
    "however , using hap has an inherent drawback that it may lead to a severe  doubly - near - far \" problem due to distance - dependent power loss @xcite .",
    "that is , the far - away users quickly deplete their batteries because they harvest less energy in the downlink ( dl ) but consume more energy in the uplink ( ul ) for information transmission . to tackle this problem , separately located ens and aps",
    "are considered to more flexibly balance the energy and information transmissions in wpcns @xcite . in this paper , we consider the method using either co - located or separate en and information ap to build a wpcn .",
    "most of the existing studies on wpcns focus on optimizing real - time resource allocation , e.g. , transmit signal power , waveforms and time slot lengths , based on instantaneous channel state information ( csi , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the long - term network performance optimization based mainly on the average channel gains .",
    "it is worth mentioning that network optimizations in the two different time scales are complementary to each other in practice .",
    "that is , we use long - term performance optimization methods for the initial stage of network planning and deployment , while using short - term optimization methods for real - time network operations after the deployment .",
    "many current works on wpcns use stochastic models to study the long - term performance because of the analytical tractability , especially when the wds are mobile in location .",
    "for instance , @xcite applies a stochastic geometry model in a cellular network to derive the expression of transmission outage probability of wds as a function of the densities of ens and information aps .",
    "similar stochastic geometry technique is also applied to wpt - enabled cognitive radio network in @xcite to optimize the transmit power and node density for maximum primary / secondary network throughput . however , in many application scenarios , the locations of the wds are fixed , e.g. , a sensor network with sensor ( wd ) locations predetermined by the sensed objects , or an iot ( internet - of - things ) network with static wds . in this case , a practical problem that directly relates to the long - term performance of wpcns , e.g. , sensor s operating lifetime , is to determine the optimal locations of the ens and aps .",
    "nonetheless , this important node placement problem in wpcns is still lacking of concrete studies .    in conventional battery - powered wireless communication networks ,",
    "node placement problem concerns the optimal locations of information aps only , which has been well investigated especially for wireless sensor networks using various geometric , graphical and optimization algorithms ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there exist major differences between the node placement problems in battery - powered and wpt - enabled wireless communication networks . on one hand ,",
    "a common design objective in battery - powered wireless networks is to minimize the highest transmit power consumption among the wds to satisfy their individual transmission requirements .",
    "however , such energy - conservation oriented design is not necessarily optimal for wpcns , because high power consumption of any wd can now be replenished by means of wpt via deploying an en close to the wd . on the other hand , unlike information transmission , wpt will not induce harmful co - channel interference to unintended receivers , but instead can boost their energy harvesting performance .",
    "these evident differences indicate that the node placement problem in battery - powered wireless communication networks should be revisited for wpcns , to fully capture the advantages of wpt .",
    "in this paper , we study the node placement optimization problem in wpcns , which aims to minimize the deployment cost on ens and aps given that the energy harvesting and communication performances of all the wds are satisfied .",
    "our contributions are detailed below .    1 .",
    "we formulate the optimal node placement problem in wpcns using either separated or co - located en and ap . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we then transform the minimum - cost deployment problem into its equivalent form that optimizes the locations of fixed number of ens and aps ; 2 .",
    "the node placement optimization using separated en and ap is highly non - convex and hard to solve . to tackle the non - convexity of the problem",
    ", we first propose an efficient cluster - based greedy algorithm to optimize the locations of ens given fixed ap locations .",
    "then , a trial - and - error based algorithm is proposed to optimize the locations of aps given fixed ens locations .",
    "based on the obtained results , we further propose an effective alternating method that jointly optimizes the en and ap placements ; 3 .",
    "for the node placement optimization using co - located en and ap ( or hap ) , we extend the greedy en placement method under fixed aps to solving the hap placement optimization , which is achieved by incorporating additional considerations of dynamic wd - hap associations during hap placement .",
    "specifically , a trial - and - error method is used to solve the wd - hap association problem , which eventually leads to an efficient greedy hap placement algorithm .    due to the non - convexity of the node placement problems in wpcns ,",
    "all the proposed algorithms are driven by the consideration of their applicabilities to large - size wpcns , e.g. , consisting of hundreds of wds and en / ap nodes .",
    "specifically , we show that the proposed algorithms for either separated or co - located en and ap placement are convergent and of low computational complexity .",
    "besides , simulations validate our analysis and show that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the network deployment cost to guarantee the given performance requirements .",
    "the proposed algorithms may find their wide application in the future deployment of wpcns , such as wireless sensor networks and iot networks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first introduce the system models of wpcn where the ens and aps are either separated or co - located .",
    "then , we formulate the optimal node placement problems for the two cases in section iii , and propose efficient algorithms to solve the problems in sections iv and v , respectively . in section vi , simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed node placement methods .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper and discuss future working directions in section vii .",
    "for the case of separated ens and aps , we consider in fig .  [",
    "61 ] a wpcn in @xmath3 consisting of @xmath4 ens , @xmath5 aps and @xmath6 wds , whose locations are denoted by @xmath7 coordinate vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the energy and information transmissions are performed on orthogonal frequency bands without interfering with each other .",
    "specifically , the ens are connected to stable power source and broadcast rf energy in the dl for the wds to harvest the energy and store in their rechargeable batteries . at the same time , the wds use the battery power to transmit information to the aps in the ul .",
    "the circuit structure of a wd to perform the above operations is also shown in fig .",
    "[ 61 ] .        in a transmission block of length @xmath11 ,",

    "the reason to use random signal instead of a single sinusoid tone is to avoid peak in transmit power spectrum density , for satisfying the equivalent isotropically radiated power ( eirp ) requirement enforced by spectrum regulating authorities @xcite .",
    "notice that the energy beamforming technique proposed in @xcite is not used in our setup , as it requires accurate csi and dl symbol - level synchronization , which may be costly to implement in a highly distributed wpcn network considered in this work .",
    "accordingly , the received energy signal by the @xmath19-th wd is @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the equivalent baseband channel coefficient from the @xmath12-th en to the @xmath19-th wd , which is assumed to be constant within a transmission block but may vary independently across different blocks .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the channel power gain , which follows a general distribution with its mean determined by the distance between the en and wd , i.e. , @xmath23 =   \\beta ||\\mathbf{u}_i -\\mathbf{w}_k||^{-d_d } , \\ \\",

    "let @xmath33/t$ ] denote the average energy harvesting rate over the variation of wireless channels ( @xmath32 s ) in different transmission blocks , we have @xmath34    in the ul information transmissions , we assume that each wd transmits data to only one of the aps . to make the placement problem tractable ,",
    "the wd - ap associations are assumed to be fixed , where each wd @xmath19 transmits to its nearest ap @xmath35 regardless of the instantaneous csi , i.e. , @xmath36 here , we assume no co - channel interference for the received user signals from different wds , e.g. , the wds transmit on orthogonal channels .",
    "besides , for the simplicity of analysis , we assume no limit on the maximum number of wds that an ap could receive data from . then , the average power consumption rate for wd @xmath19 is modeled as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the constant circuit power of wd @xmath19 , @xmath39 denotes the average transmit power as a function of the distance between wd @xmath19 and its associated ap @xmath35 , and @xmath40 denotes the ul channel path loss exponent . besides , @xmath41 denotes a parameter related to the transmission strategy used in the ul communication . to achieve a target data rate and maximum allowed outage portability @xmath42 for wd @xmath19",
    ", we have @xmath43 when truncated channel inverse transmission @xcite is used under rayleigh fading channel , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the uplink antenna gain and carrier frequency , respectively , and @xmath46 denotes the exponential integral function . ] in general , the model in ( [ 11 ] ) indicates that the transmit power increases as a polynomial function of the distance between the transmitter and receiver to satisfy certain communication quality requirement , e.g. , minimum data rate or maximum allowed outage probability , which is widely used for wireless network performance analysis @xcite .          a special case of the wpcn that we consider in fig .  [ 61 ] is when the ens and aps are grouped into pairs and each pair of en and ap are co - located and integrated as a hybrid access point ( hap ) , which corresponds to setting @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 . with the network model and hap s circuit structure shown in fig .  [ 62 ] , a hap transfers rf power in the dl and receives information in the ul simultaneously on different frequency bands .",
    "although the use of haps is less flexible in placing the ens and aps than with separated ens and aps , the overall deployment cost is reduced , because the production and operation cost of a hap is in general less than the sum - cost of two separate en and ap .    for brevity",
    ", we reuse the notation @xmath50 , @xmath49 , to denote the location coordinates of the @xmath4 haps . given other parameters unchanged ,",
    "the expression of the average energy harvesting rate @xmath51 of the @xmath19-th wd is the same as that in ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , the average power consumption rate @xmath52 can be obtained from ( [ 11 ] ) by replacing @xmath53 with @xmath50 as follows .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the index of the hap that wd @xmath19 associates with , i.e. , @xmath56      with the above definitions , the _ net _ energy harvesting rates of the wds in both cases of separate and co - located en and ap are given by @xmath57 in practice , the net energy harvesting rate can directly translate to the performance of device operating lifetime ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , given an initial battery level @xmath58 , the average time before the @xmath19-th wd s battery depletes is @xmath59 when @xmath60 , and @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "in other words , given a minimum device operating lifetime requirement @xmath63 , it must satisfy @xmath64 if @xmath65 , and @xmath62 if @xmath66 .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the locations of the wds are known and study the optimal placement of ens and information aps , which are either separated or co - located in their locations .",
    "this may correspond to a sensor network with sensor ( wd ) locations predetermined by the sensed objects , or an iot network with static wds .",
    "in particular , we are interested in minimizing the deployment cost given that the net energy harvesting rates of all the wds are larger than a common prescribed value @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 , where @xmath67 is set to achieve a desired device operating lifetime .      when the ens and aps are separated , the total deployment cost is @xmath69 if @xmath4 ens and @xmath5 aps are used , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the monetary costs of deploying an en and an ap , respectively . to solve the minimum - cost deployment problem ,",
    "let us first consider the following feasibility problem :    [ 8 ] @xmath72,\\ \\mathbf{v}^n = \\left[\\mathbf{v}_1,\\cdots,\\mathbf{v}_n\\right]\\\\      & \\text{s . t. }     & & \\lambda_k \\left(\\mathbf{u}^m\\right ) -\\mu_k\\left(\\mathbf{v}^n\\right ) \\geq \\gamma , \\ \\",

    "evidently , if ( [ 8 ] ) can be efficiently solved for any @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then the optimal node placement solution to the considered minimum - cost deployment problem can be easily obtained through a simple two - dimension search over the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. , finding a pair of feasible @xmath77 that produces the lowest deployment cost @xmath69 .    for a pair of fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 )",

    "then , the key difficulty of solving the optimal deployment problem is to find efficient solution for problem ( [ 9 ] ) .",

    "notice that the study on co - located ens and aps is not a special case of that of separated ens and aps .",
    "in fact , it adds extra constraints ( @xmath89 ) to ( [ 8 ] ) , which leave less flexibility to the nodes placement design and make the problem more challenging to solve .",
    "equivalently , the feasibility of ( [ 18 ] ) can be determined by solving the following optimization problem @xmath90 and then comparing the optimal objective @xmath91 with @xmath67 , to see whether @xmath92 holds . in the following sections iv and v",
    ", we propose efficient algorithms to solve problems ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the placement solution to ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) can be at arbitrary locations .",
    "when an en ( or a hap ) is placed at a location very close to an wd , the far - field channel model in ( [ 3 ] ) may be inaccurate .",
    "however , we learn from ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) that the optimal value @xmath91 is determined by the performance - bottleneck wd that is far away from the ens and aps ( i.e. , the channel model in ( 3 ) applies practically ) , thus having very low energy harvesting rate and high transmit power consumption . therefore , the potential inaccuracy of ( [ 3 ] ) will not affect the objective values of ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) , and the proposed algorithms in this paper are valid in practice .",
    "in this section , we study the node placement optimization for separately located en and ap in problem ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "specifically , we first study in section iv.a the method to optimize en placement assuming that the locations of aps are fixed in a wpcn . in section iv.b , we further study the method to optimize the placement of aps given fixed en locations . based on the obtained results ,",
    "we then propose in section iv.c an alternating method to jointly optimize the placements of ens and aps .",
    "in addition , an alternative local searching method is considered in section iv.d for performance comparison .",
    "we first consider the optimal en placement problem when the locations of the aps are fixed , i.e. , @xmath53 s are known . in this case , the wd - ap association @xmath35 is known for each wd @xmath19 from ( [ 22 ] ) , and @xmath52 s can be calculated accordingly from ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the proposed algorithms under the fixed ap setup can be directly extended to solve en placement problem in other wireless powered networks not necessarily for communication purpose , e.g. , a sensor network whose energy is mainly consumed on sensing and processing data , as long as the energy consumption rates @xmath52 s are known parameters . with @xmath53 s and @xmath52 s being fixed , we can rewrite ( [ 9 ] ) as @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "we can see that ( [ 13 ] ) is a non - convex optimization problem , because @xmath95 is neither a convex nor concave function in @xmath50 .",
    "as it currently lacks of effective method to convert ( [ 13 ] ) into a convex optimization problem , the optimal solution is in general hard to obtain .",
    "however , for a special case with @xmath96 , i.e. , placing only one en , the optimal solution is obtained in the following . by setting @xmath96 , ( [ 13 ] ) can be rewritten as    [ 15 ] @xmath97    although ( [ 15 ] ) is still a non - convex optimization problem ( as @xmath98 is not a concave function in @xmath99 ) , it is indeed a convex feasibility problem over @xmath100 when @xmath99 is fixed , which can be efficiently solved using the interior point method @xcite .",
    "therefore , the optimal solution of ( [ 15 ] ) can be obtained using a bi - section search method over @xmath99 , whose pseudo - code is given in algorithm [ 46 ] .",
    "notice that the right hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ 58 ] ) is always positive during the bisection search over @xmath101 .",
    "besides , we can infer that algorithm [ 46 ] converges to the optimal solution @xmath91 , because problem ( [ 15 ] ) is feasible for @xmath102 and infeasible otherwise .",

    "rather , we show that a cost - effective deployment plan can be efficiently obtained using the proposed methods . in practice , the choice of using either separated or co - located ens and aps depends on a joint consideration of the node deployment costs , the network size and the performance requirement .",
    "in this paper , we studied the node placement optimization problem in wpcn , which aims to minimize the node deployment cost while satisfying the energy harvesting and communication performance of wds .",
    "efficient algorithms were proposed to optimize the node placement of wpcns with the ens and information aps being either separated and co - located . in particular , when ens and aps are separately located , simulation results showed that significant deployment cost can be saved by jointly optimizing the locations of ens and aps , especially for large - size wpcns with a large number of ens and aps to be deployed . in the case of co - located ens and aps ( haps ) , however , the performance advantage of node placement optimization is not that significant , where we observed relatively small performance gap between optimized node placement solutions and that achieved by some simple heuristics , i.e. , placing the haps at the cluster centers formed by the wds . in practice , separated ens and aps are more suitable for deploying wpcns than co - located haps , because of the flexibility in choosing both the numbers and locations of ens and aps . nonetheless , because the optimal solution to the node placement problem has not been obtained in this paper , we may expect further improvement upon our proposed methods in the future , especially for the case of hap placement optimization .    finally , we conclude with some interesting future work directions for the node placement problem in wpcn .",

    ", we assumed in this paper that each wd has fixed association with a single ap . in practice",
    ", dynamic frequency allocation can be applied to enhance the spectral efficiency , where a wd can transmit to different aps , even multiple aps simultaneously , in different transmission blocks .",
    "besides , instead of assuming each ap can serve infinite number of wds , we can allow each ap to serve finite number of wds .",
    "in addition , we may also consider the presence of uplink co - channel interference due to frequency reuse in wpcn .",
    "the extensions require adding corresponding constraints or changing the expression of energy consumption model in the problem formulation of this paper .",
    "second , it is interesting to consider the hybrid node deployment problem that uses both co - located and separated ens / aps .",
    "third , it is practically important to consider the node placement problem with location constraints , e.g. , some areas that may forbid the ens / aps to be placed .",
    "in addition , the density of ens may be constrained to satisfy certain safety consideration on rf power radiation .    [ 59 ] let @xmath244 denote the optimal solutions of ( [ 27 ] ) calculated from the @xmath245-th ( @xmath246 ) set of assumptions made on the wd - ap associations , denoted by @xmath247 , @xmath248 .",

    "<S> the applications of wireless power transfer technology to wireless communications can help build a wireless powered communication network ( wpcn ) with more reliable and sustainable power supply compared to the conventional battery - powered network . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the fundamental differences in wireless information and power transmissions , many important aspects of conventional battery - powered wireless communication networks need to be redesigned for efficient operations of wpcns . in this paper , we study the placement optimization of energy and information access points in wpcns , where the wireless devices ( wds ) harvest the radio frequency energy transferred by dedicated energy nodes ( ens ) in the downlink , and use the harvested energy to transmit data to information access points ( aps ) in the uplink . in particular , we are interested in minimizing the network deployment cost with minimum number of ens and aps by optimizing their locations , while satisfying the energy harvesting and communication performance requirements of the wds . specifically , we first study the minimum - cost placement problem when the ens and aps are separately located , where an alternating optimization method is proposed to jointly optimize the locations of ens and aps . then , we study the placement optimization when each pair of en and ap are co - located and integrated as a hybrid access point , and propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the network deployment cost and yet guarantee the given performance requirements , which is a key consideration in the future applications of wpcns .    wireless power transfer , wireless powered communication networks , energy harvesting , network planning , node placement optimization . </S>"
