    "one of the key issues in exploring the nature of the strong interactions over the years is the investigation of baryon resonances , i.e. short - lived excited states of nucleons .",
    "its composite nature is probed in scattering experiments and is characterized not only by the complex pole position of the scattering amplitude but also by the couplings to the various channels and hence decay branching ratios .",
    "the electromagnetic structure of baryons is encoded in form factors and can be probed in two kinematical regimes defined by the sign of @xmath10 ( four - momentum transfer squared ) of the virtual photon : @xmath11 space - like , @xmath12 0 time - like . in the space - like region , high precision experiments of electron and photon scattering delivered accurate data sets on @xmath13 excitations for several resonances @xcite .",
    "the time - like electromagnetic structure of baryonic transitions can also be studied in low - energy nucleon and pion induced collisions via @xmath14 dalitz decays . due to",
    "the small positive four - momentum transfer squared ( @xmath15 ) , which is best suited to study the coupling to vector mesons , dalitz decays give an insight into the `` kinematically forbidden '' time - like region , which is inaccessible in annihilation experiments . in the low - energy range ,",
    "perturbative qcd can not be applied and the understanding of baryon transitions is associated with the question about relevant degrees of freedom of these composite objects @xcite . although at higher four - momentum transfer the respective degrees of freedom might be considered effectively as constituent quarks , at lower four - momentum transfer , @xmath16 1 gev@xmath17 , besides a quark core also a meson cloud surrounding the quark core plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the coupling of virtual photons to hadrons is strongly affected in this regime by the light vector mesons and provides the foundation of vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0(1232 ) resonance dominates pion production in @xmath18 reactions for @xmath19 2.6 gev / c@xmath17 . despite its relatively large width ( 117 mev )",
    "it is quite well separated from higher lying resonances .",
    "the dominating decay channel @xmath20 has a branching ratio of 99.4% , while the only measured electromagnetic decay @xmath21 has a branching ratio of 0.55 - 0.65% @xcite . for the unmeasured @xmath22 transition ,",
    "a theoretical estimate on the level of 4@xmath2310@xmath9 has been given @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic transition @xmath24 is predominantly magnetic dipole ( m1 ) involving a spin and isospin flip of a single quark in the s - wave state .",
    "a small d - wave admixture of quadrupole ( electric e2 and coulomb c2 ) amplitudes describes small deformations of the resonance @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic decays can be parametrized by three helicity amplitudes @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , defined in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "the first two of them are related to the transverse photon polarization , the last one is related to a virtual longitudinal photon polarization . in the limit of a real photon ( @xmath28 = 0 )",
    ", the amplitude @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "the best determinations of the helicity amplitudes @xmath30 , @xmath31 for the real photon coupling were obtained in pion photoproduction experiments by the clas @xcite , mami / a2 @xcite and legs @xcite collaborations .",
    "these helicity amplitudes are completely unknown for @xmath32 .",
    "this region can be accessed via the dalitz decay @xmath33 .",
    "the differential decay width @xmath34 can be expressed in terms of the resonance decay width @xmath35 @xmath36hence it is also related to the radiative width @xmath37 . the calculation of the partial decay width @xmath38 requires the knowledge of the evolution of the electromagnetic transition form factors ( etff ) as a function of @xmath10 , which are real in the space - like region , but get an imaginary part in the time - like region .",
    "they can be equivalently expressed in terms of the @xmath39 form factors : magnetic dipole ( @xmath40 ) , electric quadrupole ( @xmath41 ) and coulomb quadrupole ( @xmath42 ) , related to the discussed above helicity amplitudes , as introduced by jones and scadron @xcite .",
    "the formula for the @xmath43 , derived by krivoruchenko and fssler @xcite , has been applied in various model calculations @xcite . in the calculations of ztnyi and wolf @xcite",
    "an equivalent set of form factors has been used , giving a consistent result . however , as pointed out by krivoruchenko in @xcite , many former expressions for the dalitz decays of baryonic resonances @xcite were inconsistent even in the real photon decay limit , i.e. @xmath44 n@xmath45 .      in the past , a few models were proposed for the description of the @xmath0 form factors .",
    "the `` qed point - like '' model of @xmath39 vertex @xcite incorporates the simplest constant form factors fixed from reactions with a real photon at @xmath46 .",
    "this assumption is based on the small four - momentum transfers involved in the @xmath0 dalitz decay and small values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the space - like region , as reported in @xcite .",
    "it results in @xmath49 = 3 , @xmath47 = 0 , @xmath48 = 0 and provides the correct radiative decay width @xmath50 = 0.66 mev and br(@xmath51 ) = 4.19  @xmath52  10@xmath9 @xcite at the resonance pole , very close to @xmath53br(@xmath54 n@xmath45 ) .",
    "another approach , the extended vector meson dominance model ( evmd ) by krivoruchenko and martemyanov @xcite includes the excited states of the vector mesons @xmath55 , @xmath56 , ... etc .",
    "for the description of the ettf , hence providing a more complete picture of the vector meson contribution to resonance decays .",
    "parameters are constrained by the quark counting rules and photo- and electro - production amplitudes measured in the space - like region , as well as the decay amplitudes of nucleon resonances into a nucleon and a vector meson .",
    "the two component quark model by iachello and wan @xcite parametrizes the electromagnetic interaction with a direct and a vector meson coupling according to vdm .",
    "the dominant contribution ( 99.7% ) to the @xmath49 form factor is estimated by the vdm in terms of the dressed @xmath57-meson propagator , being dominant for the range of @xmath28 involved in the dalitz decays .",
    "the iachello - wan model was the first model of the etff which was analytically extended to the time - like region .",
    "it was very successful in describing the existing data of nucleon form factors in the space - like region . however , it used the pole position of the @xmath57-meson at a significantly lower value than expected @xcite .",
    "in addition , a comparison with the dilepton data collected by hades in proton - proton collisions at a higher kinetic beam energy ( 3.5 gev ) @xcite unravels that the @xmath0(1232 ) contribution with the iachello - wan form factor parametrisation can describe inclusive @xmath58 spectra well @xcite but leaves no space for the expected contributions of the higher resonances .",
    "the most recent covariant constituent quark model by ramalho - pea @xcite provides the description of the dominant @xmath40 by means of two contributions : the quark core and the pion cloud dressing .",
    "the quark core component @xcite describes the resonance as a quark - diquark structure as an @xmath59-wave state ( the electric @xmath41 and coulomb @xmath42 quadrupole form factors originate from the small @xmath60 admixture of a @xmath61 state @xcite ) .",
    "the valence quark component is determined from the lattice qcd and in agreement with the data in the space - like region ( the ebac analysis of pion photoproduction ) @xcite .",
    "the comparison with data allows also for the extraction of the meson cloud component in the space - like region @xcite .",
    "however , the model description of the time - like region requires an analytical extension .",
    "the contribution of the pion cloud to @xmath40 is parametrized with two terms : a photon directly coupling to a pion or to intermediate baryon states .",
    "the parametrization of the pion etff , used in the coupling , is in agreement with the available high - precision data @xcite .",
    "one should note that , in contrast to @xcite , this parametrization takes properly into account the @xmath57-meson pole and width . in consequence ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , the inclusive hades data on @xmath58 production in @xmath18 collisions at 2.2  gev @xcite and 3.5  gev @xcite are well described , including contributions from higher mass resonances . in the @xmath16 0.3 gev@xmath17 region ,",
    "relevant for this study , the model predicts a dominant contribution of the pion cloud , increasing as a function of the mass , and an almost constant contribution from the quark core .",
    "another source of virtual photons and hence @xmath58 pairs is the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung produced in the strong interaction field of two nucleons without intermediate resonance excitation .",
    "a description of this process combines the @xmath62 electromagnetic vertex and the @xmath18 interaction .",
    "one possibility to describe this process is the soft photon approximation ( spa ) @xcite which , however , is limited to low - energy photons due to the on - shell treatment of @xmath62 vertex and lacks of emission off internal exchange boson .",
    "the final state of @xmath63 or @xmath64 may result in our energy range from both @xmath0 dalitz decay and @xmath18 bremsstrahlung , and both processes can interfere .",
    "the coherent sum of the contributing amplitudes has been evaluated within the one - boson exchange ( obe ) models , e.g. by kaptari and kmpfer @xcite and shyam and mosel @xcite .",
    "these models provide the total @xmath58 contribution based on a coherent treatment of many amplitudes including contributions of the @xmath0 resonance and the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung . despite the similar approaches",
    "the models give different predictions for the energy dependence of differential cross sections .",
    "one should note that according to both obe models , interference effects between the @xmath0 and @xmath18 bremsstrahlung are small and play a role only at the higher @xmath58 invariant mass ( @xmath65 0.4 gev / c@xmath17 ) .",
    "this seems to justify the statement that in proton - proton collisions the @xmath18 bremsstrahlung contribution can be treated separately and added incoherently to the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "the high - acceptance di - electron spectrometer ( hades ) is a versatile magnetic spectrometer @xcite installed at sis18 , gsi darmstadt .",
    "thanks to its high acceptance , powerful particle ( p / k/@xmath66/e ) identification and very good mass resolution ( @xmath67 for dielectrons in the light - vector meson mass range ) it allows the study of both hadron and rare dielectron production in @xmath68 @xcite , @xmath69 @xcite , @xmath70 @xcite , @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 collisions in the beam energy range of a few ( a)gev .",
    "nucleon - nucleon reactions play a special role in this context , providing an important reference for @xmath69 and @xmath70 collisions .",
    "the proton beam energy of 1.25  gev was selected below the @xmath73 meson production threshold in order to favour @xmath0(1232 ) production .",
    "it was extensively studied via exclusive channels with one pion in the final states @xmath74 and @xmath3 by hades . the first attempt based on the resonance model of teis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite unravelled difficulties in the description of both the yield and angular projections @xcite .",
    "extended studies based on various observables in the framework of a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the bonn - gatchina group @xcite provided much better description and confirmed the dominant contribution of the @xmath0(1232 ) , yet with a sizable impact of @xmath75(1440 ) and non - resonant partial waves @xcite .",

    "the lvl2 trigger efficiency amounts to 0.84 and it has been deduced in monte carlo simulations to be independent of the @xmath86 pair mass .      the following event hypotheses were studied in this paper : 4-prong ( @xmath87 ) and 3-prong ( @xmath88 ) analyses .",
    "they require the identification of protons , electrons and positrons . the first step of the analysis ( lepton and hadron identification , track reconstruction )",
    "is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "each track was required not to have any partially or fully reconstructed neighbouring track within an angle of 5@xmath89 in order to reduce fake or double ( ghost ) particle reconstruction . in the absence of the start detector @xcite only relative time - of - flight of particles , measured in the two detectors ( tof , tofino ) in a given event was available . in conjunction with the reconstructed momentum it was possible to build all possible particle combinations ( hypotheses ) out of the pool of hadronic and leptonic tracks , with positive or negative charge . a graphical particle identification ( pid ) two - dimensional cut ( momentum vs effective mass squared )",
