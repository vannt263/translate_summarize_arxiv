    "the worldwide hype for holomorphic dynamics during the turn from 1970s to 1980s claimed the development of graphical methods to display these systems on the computer screen , with emphasis to complex julia sets @xmath0 @xcite . on the same wave ,",
    "thanks to the joint work by mandelbrot and norton , the first pictures of quaternionic julia sets came also out by applying the same method as used in @xmath1 and known under the two definitions of ` _ _ escape time _ _ ' or ` _ _ level sets _ _ ' .",
    "few works , either in graphics terms , were published on this subject since early 1980s : namely , the book @xcite and the articles by norton @xcite , holbrook @xcite , by hart , kauffman and sandin @xcite . for analogous studies in higher dimensional dynamics ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "quaternions are multi - dimensional values consisting of 4 vectors in the form @xmath2 and generate a non - abelian group .",
    "the quaternion space is named @xmath3 for convention , in honor of william r. hamilton ( 18051865 ) , inventor of such numerical values for solving some issues arising from rotation in 3-d euclidean spaces .",
    "the ` _ _ escape time _ _",
    "' method enjoys one major limitation : as one tries to display , for example , the _ non - filled - in _",
    "julia sets of basins @xmath4 of attraction to a finite limit fixed point @xmath5 and extending to @xmath6 ( often retrieved by the iterates of rational maps )",
    ". this article explains how to modify the ` standard ' method so to fill this leak and extend it to the ` non - filled - in ' case . after resuming the technical details of the standard method in section [ background ] ,",
    "we discuss the novelties in section [ considerations ] ; finally , the implementation into the program qhd is explained in section [ qhd ] .",
    "in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , points 1 ) and 2 ) are the same , so that real julia sets @xmath14 are pointwisely totally disconnected ( in fact , for point 2 ) , we have : @xmath15 ) or the whole real line ( for point 3 ) , @xmath14 is @xmath13 dimensional ) .",
    "as far as the author knows , it is not known whether point 1 ) holds for quaternionic @xmath0 too , or they are just disconnected sets with ( hyper-)volumes .",
    "we will implicitly assume here the first two cases only , discarding _ a priori _ the third one , which leads to the trivial case where @xmath0 spans over the whole @xmath18-dimensional space .      for complex numbers ,",
    "any julia set @xmath0 can be successfully displayed with the already available methods ; new and customised methods are anyway required to explore local vector fields about the fixed points @xmath5 .",
    "but quaternionic @xmath0 did not share the same luck .",
    "the method employed in @xmath3 was radically borrowed from @xmath1 . however , as the related literature of those times indicates  together with the book @xcite , the road - map was to display the iterations of polynomials and to develop the details enhancement : in fact , those graphical examples always concerned of disconnected or of the filled - in varieties @xmath0 only , mostly coming from the family of general quadratic polynomials @xmath19      julia sets are mostly a mathematical question .",
    "this flaw in graphical terms was just the side effect from the interests of those pioneering researchers , who mainly wanted to start from the easier properties of polynomials display in 3 dimensions as rotations of the related @xmath0 in @xmath1 around the x - axis . ] .",
    "quaternions are non - commutative and the study of rational maps in @xmath3 may get to high level of complication , in mathematical terms : so the investigation on these maps was not pursued .",
    "so it came that the graphics development was not considered along that direction : there was no need to quest on the central question of this article throughout the older works , because all topological cases of julia sets for polynomials were already fulfilled by the standard method .",
    "( the complete related literature was listed in the bibliography . )",
    "thus we can reasonably state that this problem was still open .",
    "filled - in _ julia set @xmath9 includes all seed points whose forward iterated orbits do not tend , due to the complicate dynamics  where one can not properly speak of convergence  in the neighborhood of indifferent fixed points , both for the rational and irrational case . ] to @xmath6 .",
    "topologically speaking , the boundary of a filled - in @xmath9 is homeomorphic to a closed and bounded curve ( even with fixed points ) . but",
    "exceptions are thrown when @xmath9 also extends to @xmath6 : for example , in the classic example of the cubic rational map , resulting from newton s method applied to the complex function @xmath20 , @xmath21 this variety of julia sets @xmath9 will be said _ ` non - filled - in ' _ :",
    "this case is out of the range of possibilities for the ` escape time ' method when applied to quaternions .",
    "being @xmath0 displayed as a three dimensional model , the latest improvements , dating back to early 1990s ( see references list ) , mainly concerned of the application of efficient illumination techniques or of improving the boundary refinement .",
    "successful results in the former direction were achieved by means of phong illumination model @xcite ; whereas the reader may consult @xcite about the second issue .",
    "today software performs higher quality pictures of @xmath0 than ever before , but these programs , the reader can watch the earliest results from the application of our method by one of such high quality programs . ]",
    "still rely on the standard method : thus only the filled - in @xmath0 can be properly displayed . after deeply scanning the web and consultations with experts in this topic , programs displaying the non - filled - in family have been not obviously coded yet .",
    "author s solution wants to overcome this limitation ; the related code has been already implemented and tested to work into one pc program ` qhd ' , freely downloadable from author s site and applied to render some among the further pictures .      from ( [ introeq1 ] )",
    ", one understands that julia sets @xmath0 exist in four dimensions .",
    "so one is not able to figure them in mind or to display somewhere .",
    "one is just able to embed them into two ( @xmath22 ) or three ( @xmath23 ) real euclidean spaces onto the computer screen . in this sense ,",
    "different two - staged methods are available but in general they all root to a first stage where values / points are computed and to a second one , when the screen points are colored . in @xmath1 colors palettes may be arbitrarily set ( even to render purely aesthetic effects ) , but in @xmath3 rigor shall be followed because @xmath0 shall give their solid model look .        1",
