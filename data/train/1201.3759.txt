    "pulsar - like compact stars as the densest observable objects in the universe , are not only important in understanding diverse phenomena in astronomy , but also significant in fundamental physics .",
    "the answer to the question whether they are neutron or quark stars would have profound implications on the physics of condensed matter , the nature of strong interaction as well as the qcd phase diagram.@xcite    investigating the state of condensed matter inside pulsar - like compact stars by first principles is extremely difficult .",
    "however , it is meaningful to consider some phenomenological models to understand observational properties of pulsar - like compact stars .",
    "we conjectured that pulsar - like compact stars could be `` quark - cluster stars '' which are composed of quark - clusters with almost equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks , and could be in a solid state if the kinetic energy of quark clusters ( order of @xmath2 , with temperature @xmath3 ) is lower than the interaction energy between the clusters . from a physical point of view , we knew that strong coupling between quarks is still very strong even in the hot quark - gluon plasma,@xcite so in cold quark matter at realistic baryon densities ( @xmath0 ) , quarks would be expected to be also coupled strongly and to condensate in position space , rather than only in momentum space , to form quark clusters . from an astronomical point of view , the stiff equation of state of quark - cluster matter could naturally explain the @xmath4 solar mass neutron star,@xcite and the solid state star could provide gravitational , phase transition and elastic energies to understand bursts of anomalous x - ray pulsars , soft gamma - ray repeaters and even the shallow decay of gamma - ray burst afterglow.@xcite    more observational hints come from the surface , since the surface of quark - cluster stars could be bare and is chromatic confined , which is quite different from that of conventional neutron stars .",
    "one important surface hint is the drifting  @xcite and bidrifting  @xcite subpulses .",
    "the vacuum gap model can explain drifting subpulses naturally,@xcite but for conventional neutron star , the binding energy is too low to form such a vacuum gap.@xcite however , for quark - cluster stars , the surface is chromatic confined and the potential barrier built by the electric field in the vacuum gap above the polar cap can prevent electrons from streaming into the magnetosphere , therefore a vacuum gap can be formed.@xcite other important surface hints are associated with the bare surface of quark - cluster stars . as discussed in xu ( 2002 ) ,",
    "a quark star could be born to be bare .",
    "such a bare quark - cluster star can not only provide a clean fireball for supernovae and gamma - ray bursts , but also explain the thermal featureless spectrum of neutron stars.@xcite what is more , quark - cluster stars are enveloped in thin electron layers and vortex hydrodynamical oscillations may be invoked in those electron seas , which could explain the absorption features detected in the spectra of some pulsar - like compact stars .",
    "@xcite    the outline of the paper is as following . in ",
    "@xmath5 , we briefly review the quark - cluster star model . in  @xmath6 ,",
    "we summarize different hints from the surface of quark - cluster stars . in ",
    "@xmath7 , conclusions are presented .",
    "although pulsars have been discovery for more than @xmath8 years , the inner structure of pulsar - like compact stars is still in controversy .",
    "conventional neutron stars and quark stars are two main types of models .",
    "while conventional neutron stars are composed mainly of hadrons , the equation of supra - nuclear matter should be understood essentially in the level of quarks .",
    "previously it is supposed that a perturbative strong interaction inside quark stars could make quarks to be almost free if the coupling is weak , whereas for the conventional neutron stars , the highly non - perturbative strong interaction makes quarks grouped into neutrons .",
    "however , results of relativistic heavy ion collision experiments have shown that the interaction between quarks is very strong in hot quark - gluon plasma .",
    "@xcite therefore , in cold quark matter at realistic baryon densities ( @xmath0 ) , quarks could also be coupled strongly and the strong interaction could make quarks to condensate in position space to form quark clusters .",
    "we may then expect that quark matter inside compact stars could be in a `` quark clustering phase '' , where the energy scale would be high enough to allow the restoration of 3-light - favor symmetry , but may not be high enough to make the quarks really deconfined . for a realistic pulsar - like compact star whose temperature is low",
    ", the kinetic energy of quark clusters should be much lower than the interaction energy between the clusters , and the stars should in a solid state .",
    "the peculiar inner structure of quark - cluster stars which are very different from conventional neutron stars would result in special global and surface properties .",
    "these properties are not only instructive for us to understand astrophysical phenomena , but also helpful to identify quark - cluster stars . globally speaking ,",
    "quark - cluster stars have stiff equation of state with which a compact star could have a maximum mass even to be @xmath9 solar mass .",
    "@xcite the heat capacity of quark - cluster matter is negligible , therefore the cooling behavior would be different from conventional neutron stars,@xcite and the missing compact star of sn1987a could be a quark - cluster star.@xcite gravitational and elastic energies of solid quark - cluster stars could explain bursts of anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters;@xcite the latent heat of phase transition of quark - cluster matter from liquid to solid could explain the shallow decay phase of gamma - ray bursts.@xcite as for the surface of quark - cluster stars , it could be bare and is chromatic confined , and would be directly associated with the broadband radiation of pulsar - like compact stars . in the next section , we may discuss the details about hints from the surface .",
    "in addition , the conjectured quark - cluster matter with 3-flavor symmetry may also have profound implication to the research of cosmic rays .",
    "strangelets composed by quark clusters would exist and propagate in interstellar space if the gravitational energy is not significant to form stable quark clusters with strangeness .",
    "it is well know that the most stable hadrons are nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) , with mass of @xmath10 mev .",
    "the simplest particle in 3-flavor symmetry is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 mev ) , but the interaction between @xmath13 s is attractive.@xcite therefore the simplest quark clusters in compact stars would be @xmath13-@xmath13 dibaryon , the so - called @xmath14-particle.@xcite a strangelet with mass per baryon @xmath15 mev ( i.e. , binding energy per baryon @xmath16 mev ) could be stable in cosmic rays , and would decay finally into nucleons when collision - induced decrease of baryon number make it unstable due to the increase of surface energy . when a stable strangelet with probably a few ( or decades of ) quark clusters bombard the atmosphere of the earth , its fragmented nuggets may decay quickly into @xmath13 s by strong interaction and further into nucleons by weak interaction .",
    "quark - cluster stars could be bare , since proto - quark - cluster stars may be bare owing to strong mass ejection and high temperature,@xcite and accretion of supernova fallback and the debris disk are unlikely to cover the star with a crust.@xcite for bare quark - cluster stars , surface clusters are confined by strong colour interaction while the huge potential barrier built by the electric field can usually prevent electrons from streaming freely into the magnetosphere.@xcite    several observational facts have indicated that such a bare , self - confined surface could be necessary for us to understand different phenomena .",
    "these hints from the surface of pulsar - like compact stars may help us identify quark - cluster stars too .",
    "drifting subpulses were first explained by ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) . in the seminal paper , a vacuum gap",
    "was first suggested above the polar cap of a pulsar .",
    "the sparks produced by the inner - gap breakdown result in the subpulses , and the @xmath17 drift which is due to the lack of charges within the gap , causes the observed drifting features .",
    "however , the above model encounters the so - called `` binding energy problem '' .",
    "calculations have shown that the binding energy of fe at the neutron star surface is @xmath18 kev,@xcite which is not sufficient to reproduce the vacuum gap .",
    "one way to solve this binding energy problem is the a partially screened inner gap model,@xcite but a simple way would be in the bare quark - cluster star model.@xcite    in yu & xu ( 2011 ) , the magnetospheric activity of bare quark - cluster star was investigated in quantitative details .",
    "since quarks on the surface are confined by strong color interaction , the binding energy of quarks can be considered as infinity compared to electromagnetic interaction . as for electrons on the surface ,",
    "on one hand the potential barrier of the vacuum gap prevents electrons from streaming into the magnetosphere , on the other hand the total energy of electrons on the fermi surface is none zero .",
    "therefore , the binding energy of electrons is determined by the difference between the height of the potential barrier in the vacuum gap and the total energy of electrons .",
    "calculations have shown that the huge potential barrier built by the electric field in the vacuum gap above the polar cap can usually prevent electrons from streaming into the magnetosphere , unless the electric potential of a pulsar is sufficiently lower than that at the infinite interstellar medium .",
    "figure 1 shows a potential barrier of electrons on the stellar surface of a typical pulsar.@xcite    we conclude that in the bare quark - cluster star model , both positive and negative particles on the surface are usually bound strongly enough to form a vacuum gap above its polar cap , and the drifting subpulses can be understood naturally .",
    "it is well known that the radiation fireballs of gamma - ray bursts and supernovae as a whole move towards the observer with a high lorentz factor.@xcite the bulk lorentz factor of the ultrarelativistic fireball of grbs is estimated to be order of @xmath19.@xcite for such an ultrarelativistic fireball , the total mass of baryons can not be too high , otherwise baryons would carry out too much energy of the central engine energy , and this is the so - called `` baryon contamination '' . for conventional neutron stars as the central engine , the number of baryons loaded with the fireball is unlikely to be small , since neutron stars are gravity - confined and the luminosity of fireball is extremely high .",
    "however , the baryon contamination problem can be solved naturally if the central compact objects are quark - cluster stars .",
    "the bare and chromatic confined surface of quark - cluster stars separate baryonic matter from the photon and lepton dominated fireball .",
    "inside the star , baryons are in quark - cluster phase and can not escape due to strong color interaction , but @xmath20-pairs , photons , neutrino pairs and magnetic fields can escape from the surface .",
    "thus , the surface of quark - cluster stars automatically generates a low baryon condition for grbs as well as supernovae.@xcite    a nascent quark - cluster star born in the center of grb or supernova would radiate planck - like thermal emission due to its ultrahigh surface temperature,@xcite and the photon luminosity is not constrained by the eddington limit since the surface of quark - cluster stars could be bare and is chromatic confined . therefore , the strong radiation pressure caused by enormous thermal emissions from quark - cluster stars might play an important role in promoting core - collapse supernovae.@xcite calculations have shown that the radiation pressure due to such strong thermal emission can push the overlying mantle away through photon - electron scattering with energy as much as @xmath21 ergs .",
    "such photon - driven mechanism in core - collapse supernovae by forming a quark - cluster star inside the collapsing core is promising to alleviate the current difficulty in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "an illustration of the photon - driven mechanism is shown in figure 2.@xcite    the nascent quark star could be in a fluid state , but according to xu & liang ( 2009 ) , a phase transition of the quark star from liquid to solid could occur about @xmath22 s later after its birth . since the quark - cluster star in phase transition would emit thermal radiation at almost constant temperature and a solid quark star",
    "would cool very fast due to its extremely low heat capacity,@xcite the latent heat of this phase transition not only provides a long - term steady central engine , but also shows an abrupt cutoff of energy injection when the phase transition ends .",
    "such kind of energy injection may explain the long - lived plateau followed by an abrupt falloff observed in some afterglows.@xcite a schematic cooling behavior of a new - born quark star is shown in figure 3.@xcite after the central quark - cluster star is solidified , star - quake would occur when strains accumulate to a critical value .",
    "the star - quake induced energy ejection would then results in the observed x - ray flares of bursts.@xcite      in conventional neutron star / crusted quark stars models , an atmosphere exists above the surface of central star",
    ". the spectrum determined by the radiative transfer in atmosphere should differ substantially from planck - like one , depending on the chemical composition , magnetic field , etc.@xcite many calculations ( e.g. , romani ( 1987 ) ; zavlin , pavlov , & shibanov 1996 ) show that spectral lines should be detectable with the spectrographs on board chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "one expects to know the chemical composition , magnetic field of the atmosphere through such observations , and eventually to determine the mass of the compact star according to the redshift and pressure broadening of an absorption spectrum .",
    "however , up to now , no atomic line has been observed with certainty .",
    "although this discrepancy could be explained for some of the sources by assuming a low - z element ( hydrogen or helium ) photosphere or by adjusting the magnetic field , we address that the featureless thermal spectrum can be understood naturally in the bare quark - cluster star scenario.@xcite the best example is the detailed spectral analysis of the combined x - ray and optical data of rx j1856.5 - 3754 , which have shown that no atmosphere model can fit well the data.@xcite    nevertheless , the best absorption features were detected for the central compact object ( cco ) 1e 1207.4 - 5209 in the center of supernova remnant pks 1209 - 51/52 at @xmath23 kev and @xmath24 kev.@xcite although initially these features were thought to be due to atomic transitions of ionized helium , soon thereafter it was noted that these lines might be of electron - cyclotron origin.@xcite recent timing results seems to agree with the electron - cyclotron interpretation.@xcite but this simple single particle approximation might not be reliable due to high electron density on strange stars , and xu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) investigated the global motion of the electron seas on the magnetized surfaces .",
    "it is found that hydrodynamic surface fluctuations of the electron sea would be greatly affected by the magnetic field , and an analysis shows that the seas may undergo hydrocyclotron oscillations whose frequencies are given by @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the fact that the absorption feature of 1e 1207.4 - 5209 at @xmath28 kev is not much stronger than that at @xmath29 kev could be understood in this hydrocyclotron oscillations model , because these two lines with @xmath30 and @xmath31 could have nearly equal intensity , while the strength of the first harmonic is much smaller than that of the fundamental in the electron - cyclotron model . besides the absorption in 1e 1207.4 - 5209",
    ", the detected lines around @xmath32 kev in the burst spectrum of sgr 1806 - 20 and those in other dead pulsars ( e.g. , radio quiet compact objects ) would also be of hydrocyclotron origin.@xcite",
    "the nature of pulsar - like compact stars is closely related to the physics of condensed matter and the elementary strong interaction . according to the results of relativistic heavy ion collision experiments and various properties of pulsar - like compact stars , we conjecture that quarks could be coupled strongly and condensate in position space to form quark clusters in cold dense matter at realistic baryon densities ( @xmath0 ) . under this scenario , pulsars could be `` quark - cluster stars '' which are composed of quark - clusters with almost equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks , and could be in a solid state during almost all of their lives .",
    "both global and surface properties of quark - cluster stars are different from conventional neutron stars .",
    "globally speaking , the equation of state of quark - cluster stars is stiffer to support higher mass , while the heat capacity of quark - cluster stars is low , and solid quark - cluster stars could provide gravitational , phase transition and elastic energies to various bursts phenomena . however ,",
    "more direct hints come from the surface of quark - cluster stars . drifting subpulses phenomena",
    "may comfortably be understood with the vacuum gap above the polar cap , and we have noted that such vacuum gap can easily form above a quark - cluster star surface , while the binding energy of conventional neutron stars is too low to form vacuum gap .",
    "the bare and chromatic confined surface of quark - cluster star could naturally overcome the baryon contamination problem in gamma - ray burst and supernova fireball , and the strong thermal radiation from quark - cluster star could promote core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the non - atomic thermal spectra of some pulsar - like compact stars could also be explained by the bare surface of quark - cluster star , and we have shown that the hydro - cyclotron oscillation of the electron sea could reproduce observational frequencies of the absorption features .",
    "all these hints indicate that the surface of pulsar - like compact star should be bare and self - confined , which is different from conventional neutron stars .",
    "together with stiff equation of state , we think that the quark - cluster star model is reasonable to describe pulsar - like stars .",
    "we also expect future astrophysical observations would identify quark - cluster stars along this line .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that a high binding ( @xmath33 mev per baryon ) between quark clusters not only results in the large maximum mass of quark - cluster stars,@xcite but also favors one to conjecture that bulk quark - cluster matter in 3-flavor symmetry could be absolutely stable . compared with nuclear matter ( binding energy of @xmath34 mev per baryon )",
    ", strange quark - cluster matter is bound strongly , indicating that the color interaction is still very strong for cold matter at a few nuclear densities .",
    "no - detection of stellar - mass black holes with mass @xmath35 may hint that the maximum mass for quark - cluster stars is really large .",
    "we would like to thank useful discussions at our pulsar group of pku .",
