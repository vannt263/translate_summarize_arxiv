    "line tension  @xcite occurs in the presence of a three - phase contact line , which separates three phases of matter , such as the liquid , solid , and vapor , of a pure substance . therefore",
    ", despite the fact that researchers have debated whether line tension plays a role in wetting as its overall magnitude is quite low  @xcite , line tension must play some role for a small cap - shaped droplets wetting a substrate .",
    "in fact , the line tension is known to play a fundamental role in the stability of such a droplet  @xcite .",
    "two decades ago , widom  @xcite predicted that line tension would induce a morphological transition of a droplet placed on a flat substrate .",
    "there have also been several studies  @xcite of such line - tension - induced morphological transitions .",
    "recently , the interest of researchers has turned from flat , structureless substrates to more complex substrates with differing complexities and geometries . in particular , the wetting and spreading strategies borrowed from biological structures have potential in the development and design of new materials based on the design principle known as biomimetics  @xcite .",
    "however , to date , the line - tension effects have been primarily considered on flat substrates  @xcite .",
    "there have been almost no theoretical attempts to clarify the line - tension effects on various substrates with complex geometries except for a very small number of works expounding on line - tension effects on spherical substrates  @xcite .",
    "there have also only been a small number of experimental studies concerning a droplet on a spherical substrate  @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we extend our previous work  @xcite on the line - tension effects on convex and concave spherical substrates and consider the line - tension effects on the morphology of a cap - shaped droplet of a non - volatile liquid placed on top of a complete sphere .",
    "we find that the equator of the spherical substrate plays a special role .",
    "the contact line of the droplet can not cross the equator while changing the magnitude of line tension continuously . when the substrate is hygrophobic or hydrophobic ( i.e. young s contact angle is large ) , a morphological transition from a cap - shaped droplet to a spherical droplet is observed for a large , positive line tension ; this result is similar to the drying transition induced by positive line tension on a flat substrate , as predicted by widom  @xcite .",
    "when the substrate is hygrophilic or hydrophilic ( i.e. , the young s contact angle is small ) , a wetting transition is observed , in which the droplet completely encloses the spherical substrate to form a spherically wrapped droplet .",
    "the droplet also can not spread over the substrate indefinitely given a large , negative line tension .",
    "instead , the contact line asymptotically approaches the equator from either above or from below while increasing the magnitude of negative line tension .",
    "therefore , the equator plays the same role as infinity for a plane substrate .    in the following , we will study the effect of the line tension on the morphology of a thermodynamically stable and metastable droplet placed on top of a convex spherical substrate using the capillary model .",
    "the stability of a cap - shaped droplet against fluctuations that do not preserve its circular shape will not be considered .",
    "it is well known , however , that the capillary model possesses a short - wavelength instability  @xcite on a flat substrate , which was shown  @xcite to be not physical when the molecular interaction near the three - phase contact line is included through a disjoining pressure  @xcite .",
    "we will leave this problem of the fluctuation and the inclusion of the disjoining pressure on a spherical substrate for future investigation .",
    "in our previous work  @xcite , we considered line - tension effects on the critical nucleus of a volatile liquid heterogeneously nucleated on a spherical substrate and also considered the gibbs free energy , which was appropriate to the nucleation . in this study , we focus on the physics of line tension on a cap - shaped droplet of a non - volatile liquid placed on a spherical substrate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] .",
    "in particular , we consider a droplet with radius @xmath2 placed on the top of a spherical substrate of radius @xmath3 .",
    "the angle @xmath4 made by two tangential lines at the contact line is the contact angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] ) .",
    "since the droplet volume is held constant , the radius @xmath2 and the contact angle @xmath4 are not independent .     and that of the spherical substrate with radius @xmath3 are separated by a distance @xmath5 .",
    "the contact angle is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "note that the three - phase contact line passes through the equator when @xmath6 . ]",
    "the number of molecule within the droplet is fixed since we consider an incompressible non - volatile liquid with fixed volume .",
    "then , we have to consider the helmholtz free energy of the droplet . according to the classical idea of wetting and nucleation theory  @xcite , which is known as the capillary model , the helmholtz free energy @xmath7 of a sessile droplet is @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the surface areas of the liquid - vapor and liquid - solid ( substrate ) interfaces , respectively , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are their respective surface tensions .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is the free energy gained when the solid - vapor interface with surface tension @xmath15 is replaced by the solid - liquid interface with surface tension @xmath13 .",
    "the effect of the line tension @xmath16 is given by the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1l ] ) , where @xmath17 denotes the length of the three - phase contact line .",

    "( [ eq:9l ] ) . therefore , even on a spherical curved surface , the contact angle in mechanical equilibrium is determined from the classical young s equation ( [ eq:9l ] )  @xcite and @xmath32 if line tension can be neglected ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "the cap - shaped droplet may transform into the wrapped spherical droplet at @xmath144 ( complete wetting transition ) . by further increasing the line tension",
    ", the metastable cap - shaped droplet may transform into a detached metastable spherical droplet ( pseudo drying transition ) at @xmath145 .",
    "the metastable cap - shaped droplet whose contact line is fixed at the equator becomes finally unstable at @xmath146 .",
    "the effects of negative line tension on the droplet on a spherical substrate are different from those on a flat substrate .",
    "as we increase the magnitude of the negative line tension ( @xmath147 ) , the contact angle asymptotically approaches the characteristic contact angle @xmath43 from above ( @xmath148 ) when the three - phase contact line is located on the upper hemisphere , and it approaches @xmath43 from below ( @xmath149 ) when the three - phase contact line is located on the lower hemisphere .",
    "therefore , the three - phase contact line indefinitely approaches the equator of the substrate from both above and below .",
    "however , the contact line always remains in its original hemisphere , and can not cross the equator .",
    "this finding can be easily understood , because the contact - line length is maximized at the equator . in order to maximize the negative gain of the line - tension contribution of the helmholtz free energy ,",
    "the contact line approaches the equator but never crosses it .",
    "therefore , the droplet always remains on its original hemisphere , irrespective of the magnitude of the line tension .",
    "since this study is concerned with the thermodynamics of a droplet , the stability of a cap - shaped droplet against fluctuations that do not preserve its circular shape is not considered .",
    "it is well known that the capillary model of the cap - shaped droplet employed in this work possesses short - wavelength instability  @xcite for negative line tension on a flat substrate since the undulation of the contact line around the circular shape will necessarily increase the contact - line length and will decrease the free energy .",
    "however , mechkov et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this instability is not physical when the molecular interaction near the three - phase contact line is included using the disjoining pressure and the interface - displacement model  @xcite .",
    "we will leave this problem of the fluctuation and the inclusion of the disjoining pressure on a spherical substrate for future investigation .",
    "in this study , we considered the line - tension effects on the stability of a cap - shaped droplet of a fixed volume , placed on a spherical substrate .",
    "we found that the contact angle is determined by the generalized young s equation , as it takes into account the effects of the line tension .",
    "the analytical expression for the helmholtz free energy is found , and it consists of the usual surface contribution and a contribution from the line tension .    using the generalized young s equation , we studied the contact angle of a cap - shaped droplet as a function of the line tension .",
    "the morphological transition from a cap - shaped droplet to a detached , spherical droplet and a wrapped , spherical droplet was examined by comparing the minimized helmholtz free energy of a cap - shaped droplet with that of spherical droplets of the same volume .",
    "we found a special role played by the equator of the spherical substrate , at which the contact - line length of a droplet reached its maximum .",
    "the contact line of the droplet can not cross the equator while changing the magnitude of line tension continuously .",
    "when the contact line of a droplet coincided with the equator , the droplet with this characteristic contact angle is pinned at the equator for a positive line tension unless its magnitude does not exceeds that for the wetting transition .",
    "the droplet is also pinned for a large negative line tension .",
    "when the young s contact angle is larger than the wetting - drying boundary ( @xmath101 ) , upon increasing the _ positive line tension _ , the helmholtz free energy of a cap - shaped droplet could exceed that of a detached , spherical droplet .",
    "then , the contact angle jumps from a finite value to @xmath0 .",
    "this morphological transition is the same as the _ complete - drying transition _ predicted by widom  @xcite for a droplet on a flat substrate .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the young s contact angle is smaller than the wetting - drying boundary ( @xmath102 ) , upon increasing the _ positive line tension _ , the helmholtz free energy of a cap - shaped droplet could exceed that of a wrapped , spherical droplet .",
    "then , the contact angle jumps from a finite value to @xmath1 .",
    "this morphological transition is similar to the _ complete - wetting transition _",
    "@xcite of the surface phase transition .",
    "on increasing the absolute magnitude of the _ negative line tension _ , the contact angle approaches the characteristic contact angle , and , therefore , the contact line approaches the equator asymptotically from either above or below .",
    "however , this result is not conclusive as the undulation of the contact line necessarily decreases the free energy and a circular contact line might be marginally stable .",
    "in fact , the interfacial shape becomes unstable for a sufficiently large negative line tension .",
    "this problem is know to be partly due to the shortcomings of the present capillary model , and it is resolved by introducing the disjoining pressure using the interface - displacement model  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the unphysical result of our capillary model in the @xmath150 limit , noted in our previous papers  @xcite , can also be avoided by introducing the disjoining pressure , which allows for a preexisting thin liquid film .",
    "the problem of the fluctuation of the contact line and the effects of the disjoining pressure remain for future investigation .    in this study , we analyzed various scenarios concerning a cap - shaped droplet on a spherical substrate using both young s contact angle and the size of the droplet as the two independent parameters .",
    "the former can be controlled by changing the material and surface chemistry of the substrate .",
    "the latter can also be controlled by changing the volume of the non - volatile liquid .",
    "therefore , experimental confirmation and verification of our predictions of the morphological transitions of a cap - shaped droplet on a spherical substrate should be feasible .",
    "this work was partly conducted while i am a visiting scientist with the department of physics , tokyo metropolitan university .",
    "i am grateful to professors h. mori and y. okabe for their continuous support .      here",
    ", we provide the mathematical derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4l ] ) ,  ( [ eq:6l ] ) , ( [ eq:18l ] ) , and ( [ eq:26l ] ) in the main text . a more detailed derivation of these formulas has already been provided in my previous publications  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the derivation is based on the integration scheme proposed by hamaker  @xcite and the change of variable from the contact angle @xmath4 to the distance @xmath5 between the centers of the two spheres of the substrate and the droplet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1l ] . by using this simple variable @xmath5",
    ", we avoid the tedious and complicated transformation of the trigonometric functions .",
    "because all these equations are linear in @xmath151 , @xmath12 , and @xmath16 , the manipulation is tedious but straightforward .        by introducing the above three formulas into eq .",
    "( [ eq:1l ] ) , the helmholtz free energy is given by @xmath156 which is reduced to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3l ] ) and ( [ eq:4l ] ) . after minimizing the free energy under the condition of constant volume @xmath49",
    ", we arrive at the equation @xmath157 which reduces to the generalized young s equation  @xcite of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11l ] ) . then , using the generalized young s equation , the minimized free energy of the cap - shaped droplet is given by @xmath158 which can be rewritten as eq .",
