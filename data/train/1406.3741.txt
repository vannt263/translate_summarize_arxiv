    "dislocations are line defects in crystalline materials which play an important role in governing the deformation and failure mechanisms in solids .",
    "the energetics of dislocations and their interactions with other defects  solute atoms , precipitates , grain boundaries , surfaces and interfaces  significantly influence the mechanical properties of crystalline materials ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the kinetic barriers for dislocation motion  dislocation glide and climb  and their dependence on crystallographic planes and directions govern ductility and creep in metals  @xcite .",
    "interaction of dislocations with vacancies , solute atoms and precipitates results in solid - solution strengthening / softening , precipitate hardening and aging in metals  @xcite .",
    "further , dislocation interactions with grain boundaries and surfaces are responsible for the observed strengthening mechanisms like the hall - petch effect  @xcite , and enhanced yield strength in surface dominated nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of dislocations ( nucleation , kinetics , evolution ) in crystalline materials is governed by physics on multiple length - scales .",
    "in particular , a dislocation produces elastic fields that are long - ranged , and through these elastic fields interacts with other defects and external loads at macroscopic scales .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum - mechanical and atomistic scale interactions play an important role in governing the nucleation and kinetics of these defects .",
    "while atomistic scale interactions can significantly influence the behavior of dislocations , these are localized to a region around the dislocation line referred to as the dislocation - core .",
    "thus , the energy of a dislocation comprises of the stored elastic energy ( @xmath2 ) , associated with the elastic fields outside the dislocation - core , and a core - energy ( @xmath3 ) associated with quantum - mechanical and atomistic scale interactions inside the dislocation - core .",
    "continuum theories based on elastic formulations have been widely used to study deformation and failure mechanisms mediated through dislocations ( cf .",
    "e.  g.  @xcite ) , where the energetics of dislocations are solely determined by the elastic energy and the core - energy is often assumed to be an inconsequential constant . in order to overcome the inability of continuum theories to describe the dislocation - core , explicit atomistic calculations based on empirical interatomic potentials",
    "have also been employed to study deformation mechanisms mediated by dislocations ( cf .",
    "e.  g.  @xcite ) , and have provided many useful insights . however , interatomic potentials , whose parameters are often fit to bulk properties , may not accurately describe the defect - core which is governed by the electronic - structure ( cf . e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "electronic - structure calculations using plane - wave implementations of density functional theory ( dft ) have been employed to study the dislocation core - structure in a wide range of crystalline materials ( cf .",
    "e.  g.  @xcite ) and the energetics of dislocation - solute interactions in metals with different crystallographic symmetries  @xcite .",
    "as the displacement fields produced by isolated dislocations are not compatible with periodic boundary conditions , these calculations have either been restricted to artificial dipole and quadrapole configurations of dislocations or free - surfaces have been introduced to contain isolated dislocations .",
    "recent efforts have also focused on the development of flexible boundary conditions by extending the lattice green s function method to electronic - structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "flexible boundary conditions accurately account for the long - ranged elastic fields of an isolated dislocation  @xcite , however , the electronic - structure in these studies is computed by introducing free surfaces to accommodate the restrictive periodic boundary conditions associated with plane - wave based dft implementations .",
    "while these aforementioned studies have provided useful insights into the dislocation core - structure , a direct quantification of the dislocation core - energy solely from electronic - structure calculations and its role in governing dislocation behavior has remained elusive thus far .",
    "we note that some prior _ ab initio _ studies using a dipole or quadrapole configuration of dislocations ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , have attempted to indirectly compute the core - energy of an isolated dislocation by subtracting from the total energy the elastic interaction energy between dislocations in the simulation cell and their periodic images .",
    "this approach assumes the spacing between dislocations is large enough that the dislocation - cores do not overlap .",
    "however , these prior studies have been conducted on computational cells containing a few hundred atoms , which , as demonstrated in this work , are much smaller than the core - size of an isolated perfect edge dislocation in aluminum .    in this work ,",
    "we conduct large - scale electronic - structure calculations using orbital - free density functional theory to study an edge dislocation in aluminum . in our study",
    ", we use the wgc kinetic energy functional  @xcite which has been shown to be in good agreement with kohn - sham dft for a wide range of material properties in aluminum  @xcite .",
    "we employ a local real - space formulation of orbital - free density functional theory  @xcite , where the extended interactions are reformulated as local variational problems .",
    "this real - space formulation of orbital - free density functional theory is used in conjunction with the finite - element basis that enables the consideration of complex geometries and general boundary conditions , which is crucial in resolving the aforementioned limitations of plane - wave basis in the study of energetics of isolated dislocations .",
    "we begin our study by computing the size of the dislocation - core for a perfect edge dislocation in aluminum . to this end , we consider a perfect edge dislocation with the atomic positions given by isotropic elasticity theory .",
    "for these fixed atomic positions , we identify the region where the perturbations in the electronic - structure arising from the defect - core are significant and have a non - trivial contribution to the dislocation energy .",
    "this allows us to unambiguously identify the dislocation - core from the viewpoint of energetics .",
    "our study suggests that the dislocation core - size of a perfect edge dislocation is about @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the burgers vector .",
    "this estimate is much larger than conventional estimates based on displacement fields , which suggest a dislocation core - size of @xmath6  @xcite , and underscores the long - ranged nature of the perturbations in the electronic fields arising from defects .",
    "we note that a similar long - ranged nature of the electronic fields was observed in recent studies on point defects  @xcite . as a next step in our study ,",
    "we allow for atomic relaxations , and the perfect edge dislocation dissociates into shockley partials with a partial separation distance of @xmath1   .",
    "the dislocation energy per unit length of the relaxed shockley partials in the simulation domain corresponding to the identified core - size , which denotes the dislocation core - energy , is computed to be @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "we next study the role of macroscopic deformations on the dislocation core - energy and core - structure .",
    "in particular , we considered a wide range of macroscopic deformations including : ( i ) equi - triaxial strains representing volumetric deformations ; ( ii ) uniaxial strains along the the burgers vector , normal to the slip plane , and along the dislocation line ; ( ii ) equi - biaxial strains along these crystallographic directions ; ( iii ) shear strains along these crystallographic directions , excepting the one which results in dislocation glide .",
    "interestingly , we find that the dislocation core - energy is significantly influenced by applied macroscopic deformations . in particular , we find that this core - energy dependence on macroscopic strains is non - linear and non - monotonic .",
    "further , this core - energy dependence on macroscopic deformations suggests that the dislocation experiences an additional configurational force beyond the peach - koehler force .",
    "this additional force arising from core - effects , and referred to as the core - force , is proportional to the strain gradients and can be significant in regions of inhomogeneous deformations . in particular , we estimate that , in the case of a dislocation dipole with the two dislocations aligned at @xmath9 to the slip direction , the core - force has a glide component which is greater than the peierls nabarro force even at a distance of @xmath10 .",
    "while we observe a significant influence of macroscopic deformations on the core - energy , the core - structure , studied using differential displacement plots , did not change significantly in response to the applied macroscopic uniaxial , biaxial and triaxial strains . however",
    ", the shear strain which exerts a glide force on the screw components of the shockley partials showed a significant influence , as expected , on the core - structure .",

    "in this section , for the sake of completeness and to keep the discussion self - contained , we provide an overview of the local real - space formulation of orbital - free dft employed in the present work and the finite - element discretization of the formulation .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a comprehensive discussion on these topics .",
    "the ground - state energy in density functional theory  @xcite for a materials system containing @xmath11 nuclei and @xmath12 electrons is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the ground - state electron density and @xmath15 denotes the vector collecting the positions of atoms . in the above",

    "this reduces the problem of evaluating the ground - state energy and electron density to a variational problem that scales linearly with system size .",
    "the widely used model for @xmath16 , which has been shown to be a transferable model , in particular , for al , mg and al - mg materials systems  @xcite , is the wang - govind - carter ( wgc ) kinetic energy functional  @xcite given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 in equation  , the first term denotes the thomas - fermi energy with @xmath24 , and the second term denotes the von - weizs@xmath25cker correction  @xcite .",

    "functional , the parameters are chosen to be @xmath30 , and the density dependent kernel is expanded as a taylor series about the bulk average electron density to second order , thus yielding a series of density independent kernels  @xcite .",
    "the second term in equation  , @xmath17 , denoting the exchange - correlation energy , includes all the quantum - mechanical interactions and is modeled in density functional theory .",
    "widely used models for the exchange - correlation energy , especially for solid - state calculations of ground - state properties , include the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite , and have been demonstrated to be transferable models for a range of materials systems and properties .",
    "the last three terms in equation   constitute the classical electrostatic energy between electrons and the nuclei .",
    "we note that all the terms in the energy functional   are local , excepting the electrostatic energy and the kernel energy , which are extended in real - space .",
    "as a local real - space formulation is desirable for scalable numerical implementations as well as the development of coarse - graining techniques , a local reformulation of these extended interactions has been proposed and implemented recently  @xcite . by noting that the extended interactions in electrostatics are governed by the @xmath31 kernel , which is the green s function of the laplace operator",
    ", the electrostatic interaction energy can be reformulated as the following local variational problem : @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the charge distribution corresponding to the ionic pseudopotential of the @xmath34 nucleus , @xmath35 denotes the electrostatic potential corresponding to the total charge distribution comprising of the electrons and the nuclei , and @xmath36 denotes a suitable function space incorporating appropriate boundary conditions for the problem being solved . in the above",

    "a real - space reformulation for these extended interactions has been proposed by taking recourse to the solutions of a series of complex helmholtz equations . in particular , if @xmath38 denotes a density independent kernel , and is approximated in the fourier - space using the approximation @xmath39 , the local reformulation of the kernel energy is given by the following saddle point problem  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41d\\br\\bigr\\}\\ , .",

    "thus , using these local reformulations , the problem of evaluating the ground - state energy and electron density reduces to a local saddle point problem in the _ electronic fields _ comprising of electron density , electrostatic potential and kernel potentials ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . such a local reformulation in real - space is crucial for employing non - homogenous dirichlet boundary conditions for studying the energetics of isolated defects in bulk , which is exploited in this work ( elaborated subsequently in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "plane wave basis has been the popular choice for the numerical discretization of the orbital - free dft variational problem  @xcite owing to the ease of computing the extended electrostatic interactions and the kernel kinetic energy functional in fourier - space using fourier transforms .",
    "however , fourier - space methods are limited to periodic systems , which poses a severe restriction in studying defects in materials .",

    "further , recent investigations have demonstrated the accuracy and computational efficiency afforded by higher - order finite - element discretization for density functional theory calculations  @xcite , which , along with the good parallel scalability of finite - element discretizations , make the finite - element basis a desirable choice for real - space orbital - free dft calculations .",

    "the energetic contributions from these electronic - structure effects can not be captured in continuum elasticity theories or atomistic calculations using empirical potentials .",
    "thus , in the present work , we consider the dislocation - core to be the region where electronic - structure effects and their contribution to the defect energy are significant .",

    "we first computed the dislocation energy at equilibrium volume ( i.e. @xmath75 ) for the various domain - sizes considered in this study , and the results are presented in table  [ tab : elasticelec ] .",
    "the computed dislocation energy increases with increasing domain - size , and has an asymptotic logarithmic divergence as expected from continuum theories . in order to understand the extent of electronic relaxations , we consider the change in dislocation energy by increasing the domain - size  for instance , from a domain - size of @xmath76 to @xmath77and denote this change by @xmath78 .",
    "this change in the energy has two contributions : ( i ) the increase in the elastic energy due to the increase in the domain - size , which we denote by @xmath79 ; ( ii ) electronic contribution from perturbations in the electronic - structure , which we denote by @xmath80 .",
    "as the elastic energy contribution to the dislocation energy is due to the elastic deformation fields produced by the dislocation , we estimate @xmath79 by integrating the elastic energy density in the region of interest . the elastic energy density at any point , in turn , is computed from an orbital - free dft calculation on a unit - cell undergoing the macroscopic deformation produced by the edge dislocation at that point .",

    "as in the case of volumetric strains , the core - energy monotonically decreases from compressive strains to tensile strains ( for the range of strains considered ) for uniaxial strains @xmath122 ( along the burgers vector ) and @xmath125 ( along the dislocation line ) .",
    "however , the core - energy dependence is non - monotonic and non - linear for @xmath123 uniaxial strain ( along the normal to the slip plane ) .",
    "these results show that the core - energy of an edge dislocation can have a complex and non - linear dependence on macroscopic strains . as in the case of volumetric strains ,",
    "the core - structure is found to be marginally sensitive to uniaxial strains .",
    "for the range of uniaxial strains considered in this study , the partial separation in the edge - component dd plots is in the range of @xmath114 and the partial separation in the screw - component dd plots is in the range of @xmath127 .",
    "the fact that the core - energy shows a strong dependence on the volumetric and uniaxial strains , while the core - structure is only marginally influenced by these strains , suggests that the electronic - structure at the core can play a dominant role in governing the energetics of dislocations and that the core - structure alone may not completely characterize the defect - core .",

    "for the range of uniaxial strains considered in this study , the partial separation in the edge - component dd plots is in the range of @xmath131 and the partial separation in the screw - component dd plots is in the range of @xmath132 .",
    "we next consider shear strains @xmath133 and @xmath134 and their influence on the core - energy and core - structure . in the present work ,",
    "we do not study the influence of @xmath135 strain , as , even at small values of shear stress resulting from this shear strain ( @xmath136 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the edge dislocation glides by overcoming the peierls barrier .",
    "the computed core - energy dependence on @xmath133 and @xmath134 shear strains is shown in figure  [ fig : shear_strain ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the core - energy dependence is symmetric in @xmath133 , to within the discretization errors of @xmath137 . on the other hand ,",
    "the core - energy dependence on @xmath134 strain is asymmetric .",
    "this qualitative change in core - energy dependence can be rationalized from the forces created by these macroscopic shear strains on the shockley partials .",
    "the shear stress associated with @xmath133 results in climb forces , in opposite directions , on the screw components of shockley partials . upon changing the sign of the shear stress , the direction of the climb forces on each of the shockley partials is reversed , but these configurations are symmetry related and thus the core - energy variation is symmetric with respect to @xmath133 . in contrast , the shear stress associated with @xmath134 results in glide forces , in opposite directions , on the screw component of shockley partials .",
    "thus , the sign of this shear stress has an effect of either increasing or decreasing the partial separation distance between the shockley partials , which is the source of the asymmetry in core - energy dependence on @xmath134 .",
    "this is also further corroborated from the core - structure , which shows a significant change in the partial separation distance in the screw - component dd plot in response to @xmath134 strain .",
    "in particular , the partial separation in the screw - component of the dd plot changes from @xmath138 at @xmath139 to @xmath140 at @xmath141 ( cf .",

    "the core - structures are found to be similar for both negative and positive @xmath133 strains of a given magnitude , as expected from symmetry .",
    "for the range of @xmath133 shear strains considered in the present work , the partial separation in the edge - component dd plots is in the range of @xmath114 and the partial separation in the screw - component dd plots is in the range of @xmath127 .",
    "the study on the effect of macroscopic strains revealed a strong dislocation core - energy dependence on macroscopic deformations .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the core - energy dependence on macroscopic strains is non - zero at zero strain .",
    "this suggests that the energetics of dislocation - cores play a non - trivial role in governing the behavior of dislocations even at small strains and at macroscopic scales . in order to elucidate the role of dislocation core - energy in influencing dislocation behavior , we consider the force on a unit length of dislocation line segment resulting from external loads or other defects .",
    "the classical force on the dislocation arising from elastic interactions is given by the peach - koehler force  @xcite : @xmath143 where @xmath144 denotes the stress tensor , @xmath5 denotes the burgers vector and @xmath145 denotes the unit vector along the dislocation line .",
    "however , since the core - energy is dependent on macroscopic strains at the dislocation core , there is an additional configurational force associated with this dependence , referred to as the core - force , and is given by @xmath146 given the non - linear nature of the core - energy dependence on macroscopic strains , @xmath147 , in general , is a function of the macroscopic strain at the dislocation core .",
    "however , for typical strains of @xmath148 occurring in most deformations in solids , @xmath147 can be computed , to leading order , from the slopes of the core - energy dependence on various uniaxial and shear strains at zero strain ( cf . figures  [ fig : uniaxial1]-[fig : uniaxial3 ] ,  [ fig : shear13]-[fig : shear23 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath149 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the peach - koehler force depends on the stress - tensor ( which is related to the strain - tensor ) , the core - force depends on the gradient of strain - tensor and can be significant in regions of inhomogeneous deformations .",
    "we note that past studies ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , employing elastic formulations to model the defect - core using dislocation dipoles and line forces , have investigated the interaction of dislocation cores with applied pressure and have suggested corrections to the peach - koehler force based on these interactions . however , a direct quantification of this core - force solely from electronic - structure calculations has been beyond reach heretofore .    in order to understand the implications of the core - energy dependence on macroscopic strains on the behavior of dislocations , we consider the interaction between two dislocations . in particular , we consider a dislocation dipole , with one dislocation ( dislocation @xmath150 ) along the @xmath151axis located at @xmath152 with a burgers vector ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath153 $ ] and another dislocation ( dislocation @xmath154 ) , also along @xmath151axis , located at @xmath155 with a burgers vector of @xmath156 $ ] ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the peach - koehler force  @xcite on a unit length of dislocation @xmath154 due to the elastic fields from dislocation @xmath150 is given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 denotes the stress tensor associated with the elastic fields produced by dislocation @xmath150 at the location of dislocation @xmath154 , and @xmath160 denotes the unit vector along the dislocation line of @xmath154 ( unit vector along @xmath151axis ) .",
    "we note that the peach - koehler force ( @xmath161 ) decays as @xmath162 , where @xmath163 denotes the distance between the two dislocations , which follows from the asymptotic behavior of the elastic field of a dislocation . on the other hand ,",
    "the core - force  force resulting from the macroscopic strain dependence of the core - energy  is given by @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the core - energy of dislocation a in the elastic field of b ( @xmath166 ) , and @xmath167 denotes the core - energy of dislocation b in the elastic field of a ( @xmath168 ) . for the dipole configuration , we note that @xmath169  @xcite , and , from symmetry , @xmath170 .",
    "thus , @xmath171 noting that @xmath172 is @xmath173 , the core - force for dipole interactions decays as @xmath173 .",
    "thus , this is a shorter - ranged force in dislocation - dislocation interactions compared to the peach - koehler force .     to the glide - plane.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in order to further investigate the quantitative aspects of this core - force and its implications on dislocation - dislocations interactions , we consider two specific cases as shown in figure  [ fig : casestudy ] . in the first case ,",
    "the dislocations are aligned along the glide - plane , whereas in the second case they are at an angle of @xmath9 .",
    "for these two cases , we computed the peach - koehler force and the core - force on dislocation b.    _ case ( i ) : _ for the first case , using the stress tensor associated with the elastic fields of a stationary edge dislocation  @xcite , the peach - koehler force is given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 denote unit vectors along @xmath56 axis , and @xmath178 .",
    "the corresponding core - force , using the strain field of a stationary edge dislocation , is given by @xmath179 the second equality in the above expression for core - force uses the fact @xmath180 ( from the strain field of a stationary edge dislocation ) , and @xmath181 , from symmetry , for an edge dislocation .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for this case , while the peach - koehler force is a glide force on the dislocation , the core - force is a climb force .",
    "_ case ( ii ) : _ for the second case , the peach - koehler force and the core - force are given by @xmath182 @xmath183 the above expression for core - force uses the fact @xmath180 ( from the strain field of a stationary edge dislocation ) , and @xmath181 from symmetry .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for this case , while the peach - koehler force is a climb force on the dislocation , the core - force has both glide and climb components .",
    "we next investigate the relative importance of the core - force in governing the dislocation behavior . to this end",
    ", we estimated the glide component of the core - force for _ case ( ii ) _ from equation  , and compared it to the peierls - nabarro force  the critical force that will cause dislocation glide .",
    "for these calculations , we used the computed elastic constants @xmath184 . using @xmath185 for the peierls stress  @xcite , we computed the peierls - nabarro force ( from equation  [ eqn : pk ] ) on a @xmath186 length of dislocation line to be @xmath187 @xmath8 . using @xmath188 and @xmath189 , estimated from the data in figures  [ fig : uniaxial1 ] and [ fig : uniaxial2 ] ,",
    "the glide component of the core - force from case ( ii ) on a @xmath186 length of dislocation line is computed to be @xmath190 @xmath8 where @xmath163 is the distance between the dislocations @xmath150 and @xmath154 measured in angstroms .",
    "it is interesting to note that even at a distance of @xmath10 , the magnitude of core - force is larger than the magnitude of peierls - nabarro force .",
    "these results suggest that the short - ranged core - force , resulting from the dependence of core - energy on macroscopic deformations , is significant up to tens of nanometers and can play an important role in governing the behavior of dislocations , especially in regions of inhomogeneous deformations .",
    "in the present work , we employed a real - space formulation of orbital - free dft with finite - element discretization to study an edge dislocation in aluminum .",
    "the local real - space formulation and the finite - element discretization are crucial in accurately quantifying the energetics of an isolated dislocation , which is otherwise not accessible using a fourier - space based formulation . in this study",
    ", we computed the core - size of an edge dislocation by identifying the region where the perturbations in the electronic - structure arising from the defect - core , which can not be accounted for in continuum theories , are significant and have a non - trivial contribution to the dislocation energy .",
    "this allows us to unambiguously identify the core - size of an isolated dislocation from the viewpoint of energetics .",
    "we estimated the core - size of an edge dislocation in aluminum to be about @xmath4 , which is much larger than conventional core - size estimates of @xmath83 .",
    "the relaxed core - structure showed two shockley partials with a partial separation distance of @xmath191 that is consistent with prior electronic - structure studies of an edge dislocation in aluminum .",
    "the core - energy  energy of relaxed shockely partials corresponding to a core - size of @xmath4per unit length of dislocation is computed to be @xmath192 .",
    "we subsequently investigated the effect of macroscopically applied deformations on the core - energy and core - structure of an isolated edge dislocation .",
    "interestingly , our studies suggest that the dislocation core - energy is significantly influenced by the applied macroscopic deformations .",
    "this core - energy dependence on macroscopic deformations results in an additional configurational force on the dislocation , beyond the peach - koehler force , and is referred to as _ core - force _ in this work .",
    "this core - force is proportional to the gradient of the strain - tensor and can be significant in regions of inhomogeneous deformations .",
    "we quantified this core - force for a dislocation dipole for two specific configurations of the dipole : ( i ) dislocations aligned along the slip plane ; ( ii ) dislocations at a @xmath193 angle to the slip plane .",
    "interestingly , for the first configuration , where the peach - kohler force is a glide force on the dislocation , the core - force is a climb force on the dislocation . for the second configuration , while the peach - koehler force is a climb force on the dislocation , the core - force has both glide and climb components on the dislocation .",
    "we estimated the glide component of the core - force for the second configuration and compared it to the peierls - nabarro force , which is the critical force required for dislocation glide .",
    "surprisingly , even up to @xmath10 the glide component of the core - force was greater than the peierls - nabarro force , suggesting that the core - force can play an important role in governing dislocation behavior , possibly even at mesoscopic scales .",
    "investigations on the influence of macroscopic deformations on the core - structure revealed that the separation between the shockley partials is only marginally influenced by uniaxial , biaxial and triaxial strains .",
    "however , the core - structure is significantly influenced by the shear strain in the plane containing the dislocation line and the direction normal to the slip plane .",
    "this is expected as the resulting shear stress exerts a glide force on the screw - component of the partials , subsequently leading to a significant change in the partial separation .",
    "the present work has provided the framework for accurately quantifying the energetics of isolated dislocations using electronic - structure calculations .",
    "while the present study focussed on an edge dislocation in aluminum , concurrent efforts are also focussed on studying a screw dislocation .",
    "further , ongoing and future efforts are also aimed at extending the computational methods to enable similar studies using kohn - sham dft , which is an important step towards considering materials systems where available orbital - free kinetic energy functionals do not offer the desired accuracy .",
    "investigating the role of core - force in governing the mechanical response at the mesoscopic scale , possibly using dislocation dynamics simulations , also presents an important direction for future research .",

    "<S> we employed a real - space formulation of orbital - free density functional theory using finite - element basis to study the defect - core and energetics of an edge dislocation in aluminum . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the core - size of a perfect edge dislocation is around ten times the magnitude of the burgers vector . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is contrary to the widely accepted notion that continuum descriptions of dislocation energetics are accurate beyond @xmath0 burgers vector from the dislocation line . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with prior electronic - structure studies , we find that the perfect edge dislocation dissociates into two shockley partials with a partial separation distance of @xmath1   . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our study revealed a significant influence of macroscopic deformations on the core - energy of shockley partials . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this dependence of the core - energy on macroscopic deformations results in an additional force on dislocations , beyond the peach - koehler force , that is proportional to strain gradients . </S>",
    "<S> further , we demonstrate that this force from core - effects can be significant and can play an important role in governing the dislocation behavior in regions of inhomogeneous deformations .    density functional theory , real space , dislocation , core size , core energy </S>"
