    "a recent breakthrough in the study of neutrino oscillations came from the observation by the super - kamiokande experiment of a deficit of upward - going atmospheric muon neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the observed electron neutrino flux was found to be consistent with the theoretical expectation from models of cosmic ray production of neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , superk measurements are consistent with earlier experiments @xcite which detected anomalous ratios of the @xmath1 to @xmath2 flux .",
    "the new high - statistics data disfavor scenarios in which @xmath1 s oscillate into sterile neutrinos ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , and the data are consistent with @xmath1 to @xmath4 oscillation ( 99@xmath5 cl ) with a large mixing angle , @xmath6 and a neutrino mass squared difference of @xmath7 ev@xmath8 ev@xmath9 .",
    "direct detection of @xmath4 appearance is extremely difficult because at low energies , the charged - current cross section for producing a tau is small and the tau has a very short lifetime .",
    "several long - baseline experiments with accelerator sources of @xmath1 @xcite have been proposed with the goal of detecting tau neutrinos from oscillations , thus confirming the superk results .",
    "the only convincing evidence of neutrino oscillations to date involves astrophysical sources , neutrinos from the sun and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "these observations involve indirect measurements , namely the disappearance of the expected neutrino fluxes .",
    "we have recently discussed the possibility of using a kilometer - size neutrino telescope to detect tau neutrinos from extragalactic sources of high - energy neutrinos such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , assuming @xmath10 with the oscillation parameters of the superk experiment @xcite . the probability for @xmath0",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath11 assuming two flavor oscillations , muon neutrinos produced in agn or grb would oscillate to tau neutrinos as they travel to the earth .",
    "over astronomical distances in the range of a megaparsec to thousands of megaparsecs , by measuring tau neutrino fluxes , one could , in principle , probe oscillations down to @xmath12 ev@xmath9 , nine orders of magnitude below current neutrino experiments @xcite . on the other hand , for the superk parameter range , with @xmath13 on the order of @xmath14 ev@xmath9 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the oscillation probability is 0.5 .",
    "it is this latter possibility that we explore in this paper .",
    "we use the simplest assumption for the flavor content of extragalactic sources of neutrinos , in the absence of oscillations , for the ratio @xmath16 to be @xmath17 .",
    "this is based on a counting argument applied to @xmath18 and @xmath19 processes . with the two - flavor oscillations suggested by the superk experiment ,",
    "the flavor ratio becomes @xmath20 after the neutrinos have traveled over astronomical distances .",
    "even in the three - flavor oscillation scenario , the ratio is still @xmath20 , because the path length of high energy extragalactic neutrinos is much larger than any neutrino oscillation length supported by the solar , atmospheric or accelerator data @xcite .",
    "the ratio for @xmath21 might get modified at high energies due to muon cooling @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath2 from neutron decay might give significant contribution , resulting in neutrino fluxes dominated by electron neutrinos as in the case of diffuse neutrino fluxes from propagating cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "we comment qualitatively in the discussion section on how our results are altered with more realistic , flavor - dependent neutrino energy cutoffs .",
    "regardless of the flavor content of the source , the maximal mixing suggested by the superk experimental results mean that there will be an appreciable tau neutrino component at the earth , so one is interested in tau neutrino detection in high energy neutrino telescopes such as antares @xcite , nestor @xcite , amanda @xcite and the next generation of large underground detectors @xcite .",
    "tau neutrino detection requires an understanding of the effect of propagating through the earth on the tau neutrino flux .",
    "the propagation of ultra - high energy tau neutrinos through the earth is quite different from muon and electron neutrinos .",
    "the earth never becomes opaque to tau neutrinos , while muon and electron neutrinos are absorbed via charged - current interactions before reaching the opposite surface @xcite .",
    "ultrahigh - energy tau neutrinos interact in the earth producing taus which , due to the short lifetime , decay back into tau neutrinos with lower energy .",
    "this cascade continues until the tau neutrinos reach the detector on the opposite side of the earth or until the energy of the neutrinos is small enough that the interaction length of the neutrino is longer than the path length through the earth .",
    "the energy and nadir angle dependence of the extragalactic tau neutrinos fluxes have been examined quantitatively in refs .",
    "@xcite . for certain fluxes , those that do not decrease too steeply with energy ,",
    "there are significant enhancements of the tau neutrino flux relative to the muon neutrino flux at energies below @xmath22 gev .",
    "an enhancement of the tau neutrino flux does not necessarily translate to dramatic modifications of the standard model ( no - oscillation ) rates for upward - going muons , especially in view of uncertainties in the normalization of the extragalactic fluxes .",
    "however , by comparing rates for upward - going muons with rates for upward hadronic / electromagnetic ( em ) showers , the signature of tau neutrino interactions is unambiguous for a large range of neutrino fluxes . in the next section",
    ", we briefly introduce the extragalactic and generic @xmath4 fluxes @xmath23 for @xmath24 that are used here . after reviewing neutrino propagation through the earth",
    ", we describe @xmath4 signatures .",
    "the fluxes considered here have a range of energy behaviors . even if the normalizations of the neutrino fluxes are uncertain , and in some cases optimistic , it is useful to make quantitative comparisons of the event rates for upward muons and upward hadronic / em showers , with and without neutrino oscillations , which we do in section iv .",
    "the quantitative results for specific models lead to model independent conclusions , which we summarize graphically .",
    "tau neutrino appearance would provide an independent confirmation of the superk results and would point towards the better understanding of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "active galactic nuclei are the most luminous objects in the universe . most of this radiation comes from their central region , indicating that the energy radiation most likely comes from accretion of matter into a superheavy black hole . protons within the agn may get accelerated via first order fermi acceleration to very high energies .",
    "they interact with protons and photons in the infalling gas , or they may exist in the jets along the rotation axis and interact with photons there .",
    "photon - proton and proton - proton interactions produce pions , which decay into charged leptons , neutrinos and photons .",
    "energetic photons ( @xmath25 mev ) from about 40 agn observed by the egret collaboration @xcite , and tev photons have been detected from mkn 421 , mkn 501 @xcite and 1es2344 + 514 @xcite . although these photons are conventionally explained by inverse compton scattering from energetic electrons , this explanation is not without problems , and a hadronic origin of gamma - ray photons from agn",
    "is a viable alternative [ 27 ] .",
    "if a large fraction of the observed energy in high energy photons from agn is produced in hadronic interactions , then agn are also powerful sources of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) neutrinos @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show neutrino fluxes predicted in the agn models of stecker and salamon @xcite and mannheim model a @xcite .",
    "both of these models predict neutrinos fluxes that represent the upper bounds for their class of the models .",
    "in particular , the stecker - salamon flux is an upper bound for agn core emission , while mannheim model a is an upper bound for agn jet emission models .",
    "stecker - salamon flux is bound by the the diffuse x - ray background , while mannheim flux is bound by the extragalactic gamma ray background .",
    "the steep , low energy neutrino flux in mannheim s model is the emission from the host galaxy via @xmath26 interactions of the agn protons in the galactic gas disk .",
    "since this part of the flux is derived with the assumption that all protons end up in the disk , it should be regarded as an upper bound .",
    "stecker - salamon flux at energies above 1 pev may get reduced due to the cooling of pions and muons in the strong magnetic fields of agn cores @xcite .",
    "the fluxes plotted in fig .",
    "1 are for the sum of muon neutrino plus antineutrino , at the source , namely , without accounting for oscillation over astronomical distances .",
    "we label the fluxes in the absence of oscillations by @xmath27 .",
    "another extragalactic source with powerful radiation and possibly associated high energy neutrino flux are the gamma ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "several models have been proposed in order to explain the origin of grb s @xcite . in the fireball model @xcite ,",
    "the gamma ray bursts are produced by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the relativistic expanding fireball with a large fraction , @xmath28 , of the fireball energy being converted by photopion production to high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "photomeson production takes place when extremely energetic protons accelerated at high energies in the ultra - relativistic shocks interact with synchrotron photons inside the fireball .",
    "the decay of these charged pions and subsequently produced muons then produce electron and muon neutrinos .",
    "contributions from proton - proton collision can be neglected in this model . in fig .",
    "1 we show the neutrino fluxes for gamma ray burst model of waxman and bahcall ( grb_wb)@xcite , in which they parameterize the flux by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 , @xmath34 for @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 gev .",
    "theoretical work has been done to set upper bounds on high energy neutrino fluxes from agn jets and grb @xcite .",
    "the bounds are based on the theoretical correlations between the cosmic ray flux and/or the extragalactic gamma ray flux and the neutrino flux .",
    "these bounds have some model dependence , and they tend to be weaker in the range of energies considered here than at higher energies ( @xmath39 gev ) .",
    "the agn and grb neutrino fluxes used here satisfy these bounds .",
    "cosmic topological defects ( td ) such as magnetic monopoles , cosmic strings and domain walls are predicted to be formed in the early universe as a result of symmetry breaking and phase transition in grand unified theories ( guts ) of particle interactions . in the td models , @xmath40-rays , electrons ( positrons ) , and neutrinos",
    "are produced directly at ultra - high energies via cascades initiated by the decay of a supermassive elementary `` x '' particle associated with some grand unified theory , rather than being produced in high energy hadronic interactions .",
    "the x particle is usually thought to be released from topological monopoles left over from gut phase transition .",
    "it decays into quarks , gluons , leptons . in this paper",
    ", we consider neutrino fluxes from topological defects models of sigl - lee - schramm - coppi ( td_slsc ) @xcite and the model of wichoski - macgibbon - brandenberger ( td_wmb ) @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two models is the main channel for energy loss of the string network , in the former it is the gravitational radiation , while in the later it is the particle production .",
    "both of these fluxes should be regarded as upper limits for td models , because they have been constructed in such a way to satisfy the bound imposed by the measured cosmic ray and gamma ray fluxes @xcite .",
    "these fluxes are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where we take representative flux of wmb model with the string mass parameter giving the largest neutrino flux that is consistent with cosmic ray data .",
    "this flux is also below the frejus @xcite and fly s eye @xcite experimental limits on the neutrino flux .",
    "we also consider two generic fluxes that have a power law behavior . the flux @xmath41 gives numerically stable results , however , our calculations with a flux with @xmath42 is unstable at very high energies .",
    "consequently , we use @xmath43 as a way to cutoff the high energy behavior .",
    "we show results for attenuated fluxes for neutrino energies up to @xmath44 gev .",
    "we have chosen the multiplicative factors in @xmath45 and @xmath46 fluxes in such a way that they exceed atmospheric flux at neutrino energies between 10 tev and 100 tev .",
    "the upper bound for strong source evolution discussed recently by waxman and bahcall @xcite would correspond to a limit of @xmath47 ( in the same units as eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) , a factor of 5 smaller than the choice of normalization we take in this paper .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "1 the atmospheric neutrino flux at zenith angle of @xmath48 and the horizontal flux . in our evaluation of the atmospheric backgrounds , we use the atmospheric muon and electron neutrino fluxes as a function of zenith angle @xcite .    we do not consider the neutrino flux from cosmic ray interactions with the microwave background .",
    "this diffuse neutrino flux is typically present at energies higher than we consider here @xcite , and it gives low event rates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cosmic ray interactions with the solar atmosphere are another source of neutrinos , however , for energies above a tev , the flux scales as @xmath49 or steeper @xcite . as we see below , tau neutrino regeneration will not be a very important feature in fluxes with such large spectral indices .",
    "for neutrino energies above 1 tev , the oscillation probability for @xmath50 in the earth is less than a percent for the parameters constrained by the superk experiment . as a consequence",
    ", we can neglect neutrino oscillation in our evaluation of tau neutrino propagation accounting for interactions in the earth .",
    "the coupled transport equations for the fluxes of the tau neutrino and its charged partner are given by @xmath51 and for taus as , @xmath52    here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are differential energy spectrum of tau neutrinos and tau respectively , for lepton energy @xmath55 , at a column depth @xmath56 in the medium defined by @xmath57 the density of the medium a distance @xmath58 from the earth - atmosphere boundary , measured along the neutrino beam path , is @xmath59 .",
    "the lepton interaction length ( in g / cm@xmath9 ) is @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the decay length of the tau .    the functions @xmath63 schematically represent interaction or decay contributions to lepton @xmath64 from lepton @xmath65 .",
    "we limit our evaluations of the tau neutrino flux to @xmath66 gev .",
    "consequently , we can ignore several terms in the coupled differential equations : the term with @xmath67 and the term @xmath68 , both in eq .",
    "only the decay contribution to the last term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( @xmath69 ) is included in our evaluation .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the tau decay is significantly more important than interactions for the energy range of interest , namely @xmath70 gev .",
    "the neglected terms start contributing for lepton energies on the order of @xmath71 gev .",
    "detailed formulae for @xmath63 appear in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our previous work ,",
    "we have described an analytic method for solving these transport equations @xcite , based on the method of naumov and perrone @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the upward @xmath4 flux for a selection of initial fluxes @xcite .",
    "we have shown that for `` flat '' initial neutrino fluxes ( @xmath72 ) , a significant number of high energy @xmath4 s cascade down in energy , resulting in enhanced low energy flux relative to the attenuated @xmath1 flux . here",
    ", we evaluate the tau neutrino flux for a more comprehensive selection of incident fluxes , including both neutrino and antineutrino attenuation . in all of our results below",
    ", we evaluate the sum of neutrino plus antineutrino fluxes or rates .    in fig . 2 and 3",
    ", we show the attenuated tau neutrino plus antineutrino flux ( blue line ) and attenuated muon neutrino plus antineutrino flux ( red line ) , scaled by a factor of the neutrino energy @xmath55 , assuming the equal fluxes of tau neutrinos and muon neutrinos incident on the surface of the earth at a nadir angle of @xmath48 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the stecker - salamon agn model , the mannheim agn ( model a ) , the two topological defects models , the waxman - bahcall grb model and the atmospheric flux .",
    "we note that the enhancement of the tau neutrino flux relative to the initial flux and also to the muon neutrino flux , is prominent for the flat fluxes , such as @xmath75 , the stecker - salamon agn model and the topological defects model of sigl _",
    "et al_. in case of the atmospheric flux , which represents the background , the enhancement is very small due to the steepness of the initial neutrino flux .",
    "the angular dependence of the upward @xmath4 flux is also distinct . as an example , in fig .",
    "4 , for the agn model of mannheim ( model a ) @xcite , we show the ratio of the neutrino flux scaled by the flux at @xmath76 for two nadir angles , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "because of the shape of the initial flux , steep for energies below @xmath44 gev , and flat for higher energies , the enhancement of the tau neutrino flux becomes significant only for energies above @xmath44 gev . at fixed energies of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath44 gev",
    ", we show the same flux ratios as a function of nadir angle .",
    "detection of muon neutrinos , in general , is via their charged - current interactions .",
    "produced muons have very large average range making the effective volume of an underground detector significantly larger than the instrumented volume . on the other hand , tau neutrino charged - current interactions produce tau , which has a very short lifetime , making its detection extremelly difficult . only at very high energies , @xmath81 pev ,",
    "the production and decay vertices are separated by a measurable distance providing a distinctive signature of tau neutrinos ( `` double - bang '' events ) @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted neutrino fluxes are low at these energies . for @xmath4 s in the energy range of @xmath82 gev considered here",
    ", the produced tau decays after a very short pathlength back to @xmath4 plus leptons or hadrons .",
    "tau neutrinos will interact via neutral currents , producing a hadronic signal as well .",
    "therefore , the signals of tau neutrino interactions below the double - bang threshold are muons from tau decay , or hadronic / em showers from the tau production and/or decay . in the first case",
    "the background to tau production of high energy muons is @xmath1 charged - current interactions . in the latter case ,",
    "the backgrounds are @xmath1 neutral current and @xmath2 charged - current and neutral current interactions .",
    "the background rates shown below are with the assumption that the electromagnetic shower from @xmath83 charged current interactions can not be distinguished from hadronic showers . as a consequence ,",
    "we evaluate the hadronic / electromagnetic ( em ) shower rates .",
    "we assume in the analysis presented below that the @xmath1 charged - current events and @xmath84 events can be rejected from the contained hadronic / electromagnetic shower signal . in both cases there is a hadronic shower which includes muons , however , the muons in the hadronic showers from pion and kaon decays are significantly less energetic than the muons from @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in the latter case ,",
    "the energy of the shower is @xmath87 the incident neutrino energy @xmath88 and the energy of the muon is @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , muons coming from particle decays in the hadronic shower are considerably less energetic because of large particle multiplicities .",
    "the average charged particle multiplicities for hadronic interactions at @xmath90 gev are larger than @xmath91 particles @xcite , so individual muon energies from charged pion and kaon decays are less than @xmath92 of the incident neutrino energy .",
    "the hadronic shower and very energetic muon of the `` muon signal '' should stand out in comparison to the hadronic / em shower signal in a detector with good energy resolution like the proposed kilometer - cubed detector icecube@xcite .",

    "the relative rates of muons and hadronic / em showers prove to be the most effective diagnostic to neutrino oscillations with the superk parameters .",
    "the standard evaluation of the muon event rate per solid angle for neutrino interactions with isoscalar nucleons @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) follows from the formula @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the neutrino energy loss , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the charged current differential cross section .",

    "6 - 9 come from assuming that the tau neutrino and muon neutrino fluxes are equal and are half the flux of muon neutrinos produced at the source .",
    "testing the oscillation hypothesis with muon neutrinos alone will be difficult .",
    "we see that with the exception of the @xmath45 and td_slsc fluxes , the observed muon rate is about half of what one would expect in the absence of oscillations .",

    "testing the oscillation hypothesis by measuring upward muons only will be very difficult .",
    "the relatively small contribution to the muon rate from @xmath4 s , despite the fact that the attenuated flux of tau neutrinos is larger than that of the muon neutrinos , is due to the fact that the muon carries a small fraction of the initial tau neutrino energy .",
    "consequently , for a muon of a given energy , if it comes from a tau neutrino ( which interacted producing a tau that subsequently decayed to a muon ) , the initial tau neutrino has a much higher energy than a muon neutrino which produces a muon directly via the charged current @xmath95 process .",

    "the hadronic / em shower signal of @xmath4 interactions is a much more promising final state from the theoretical point of view than the muon signal .",
    "the benefit is that the hadronic showers include both production hadrons and tau decay hadrons , so there is a much higher fraction of the incident tau neutrino energy visible in the detector @xcite .",

    "different energy behaviors of incident fluxes will have implications for the angular and energy dependence of the event rates of upward muons and upward hadronic / em showers , allowing for an indirect characterization of the energy dependence of the source .",
    "a more model independent test of the oscillation scenario would be to compare the measured ratio of showers to muons with the no - oscillation predictions , on an absolute scale .",
    "this requires a crude separation of the different energy behaviors of the fluxes of fig .",
    "1 . by only looking at the ratio of shower to muon events",
    ", one could confuse the agn_m95 no - oscillation ratio with the similar grb_wb oscillation ratio .",
    "however , experimentally , the energy and angular dependence of the muon event rates for the two fluxes are quite different , and grb neutrinos would reveal themselves by time correlations to observed grb events .",
    "one category of fluxes , with not too steep energy behavior ( @xmath45 , agn_ss , td_wmb , td_slsc and grb_wb ) , have a reduction in the event rates from a muon threshold of 1 tev to 10 tev at nadir angle of @xmath164 by a factor of less than 4 , whereas for the other two steeper fluxes ( @xmath46 and agn_m95 ) , the reduction is by more than a factor of 6 .",
    "these reduction factors are independent of whether or not oscillations occur .",
    "the steeper fluxes are also distinguished by muon event rates with a less marked dependence on nadir angle .",
    "if one separates the steep from the less steep examples used here , then at all three threshold energies , the band of oscillation shower to muon ratios does not overlap with the band of no - oscillation ratios .",
    "this is shown graphically in figs .",
    "22 ( a - f ) for 1 tev , 10 tev and 100 tev thresholds , respectively .",
    "in fact , for the 100 tev threshold , one does not need any information about the energy dependence of the initial flux , but in this case , the event rates are expected to be low .",
    "we have studied signals for @xmath0 oscillations with extragalactic high energy muon neutrinos .",
    "assuming superk oscillation parameters , muon neutrinos convert into tau neutrinos as they travel megaparsec distances , with both fluxes being equal at the surface of the earth .",
    "high energy muon neutrinos get absorbed as they pass through the earth , while tau neutrinos cascade down to lower energies .",
    "we find this enhancement of the @xmath4 flux in the low energy region to be prominent for flat initial spectrum , such as @xmath45 , the agn model of stecker and salamon , and the topological model of sigl _",
    "et al_. for steeper spectra , the enhancement is small because the number of higher energy neutrinos that contributes to the lower energy flux via tau decay is relatively small compared to the low energy flux of neutrinos .",
    "upward tau neutrinos , once they reach the detector , interact producing tau leptons which decay with very short lifetimes .",
    "we have considered muons from tau decay as well as its hadronic decay mode .",
    "since the planned detectors are unable to distinguish between hadronic and electromagnetic showers , we have included all the processes that give both hadronic and electromagnetic showers .",
    "we find that upward muons alone would not be sufficient to separate the tau neutrinos contribution , due to the large background from @xmath1 charged - current interactions , the small branching fraction for @xmath165 decay mode and the model uncertainty for the incident neutrino flux .    in the case of upward hadronic / em showers",
    ", we find that tau neutrinos give significant contributions , signaling the @xmath4 appearance .",
    "given the uncertainties in the normalizations of the extragalactic neutrino fluxes , combining muon rates and hadronic / em rates offer the best chance to test the @xmath166 oscillation hypothesis .",
    "as concluded in earlier work @xcite , in general , an energy threshold of between 10 tev and 100 tev for upward muons and showers is needed in order to reduce the background from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we find that diffuse agn neutrino fluxes , as described by the stecker - salamon and mannheim models , as well as neutrinos from grbs can be used to detect tau appearance . by measuring upward showers with energy threshold of 10 tev , and upward muons ,",
    "the event rates exceed the atmospheric background and are about a factor of 1.5 - 2 larger than in the no - oscillation scenario .    here",
    "we also comment on the effect of muon and pion cooling to the flavor ratio .",
    "@xcite have shown that with a negligible electron neutrino content at the source , the electron neutrino content at the earth ( in the three - flavor model ) is reduced if not negligible compared to the nearly equal muon and tau neutrino fluxes . keeping the energy spectrum unchanged , this means that the hadronic / electromagnetic shower background , which has significant contributions from @xmath167 with @xmath168 would be reduced .",
    "electron ( anti- ) neutrinos from processes in the propagation of cosmic rays may dominate at some energies @xcite .",
    "we have not considered that possibility here because of the low rates below 1 pev .",
    "steepening of the energy spectra displayed in fig . 1 due to a neutrino energy cutoff from pion and muon cooling will have implications for the tau neutrino ` pileup ' , especially for the flatter spectra where the pileup is more pronounced . as an estimate of the lower bound on the relative enhancement of the hadronic / em signal compared to the muon signal , one can compare the rates for horizontal events , where tau neutrino pileup is small .",
    "for example , figures 22 ( a - f ) show clear distinction between oscillation and no - oscillation scenarios , even in directions near horizontal , where there is no pile up .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath46 flux , where the pileup is very small @xcite , the ratio of ratios @xmath161 discussed above ranges from 2.5 to 2.8 .",
    "thus , even without the tau neutrino pileup , the oscillation scenario can be distinguished from the no - oscillation scenario .",
    "the detection of @xmath0 oscillations with a point source might also be possible . with the resolution for the planned neutrino telescopes of @xmath169 ,",
    "the atmospheric background is reduced by @xmath170 . for upward showers ,",
    "this gives less than 1 event per year for @xmath171 tev , and even less for higher energy thresholds .",
    "thus , if the point source has a flat spectrum , @xmath172 , then one would be able to detect tau neutrinos by measuring upward showers with @xmath171 tev .",
    "in the more realistic case , when the point source has a steeper spectrum ( @xmath46 ) , such as sgr a * @xcite , a normalization of @xmath173/cm@xmath9/s / sr / gev would be sufficient for the detection of tau neutrinos with threshold of 1 tev .",
    "time correlations with variable point sources would further enhance the signal relative to the background .",
    "we have demonstrated that extragalactic sources of neutrinos can be used as a very - long baseline experiment , providing a source of tau neutrinos and opening up a new frontier in studying neutrinos oscillations .    0.1true in    the work of s.i.d . and i.s .",
