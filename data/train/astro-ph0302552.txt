    "such x - ray and uv absorption is common in seyfert 1s , occurring in tandem in roughly half the population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray and uv absorbing gas components thus appear to be related , but it is not yet clear whether this is the consequence of a more general phenomenon linking the gas visible at both wavelengths , or if the absorption arises in the same gas with identical physical conditions in both the x - ray and the uv . at high resolution ,",
    "both the x - ray and the uv absorption is kinematically complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . generally only some of the uv absorption lines have velocities and physical conditions similar to those seen in the x - ray .    the locations of both the x - ray and the uv absorbing media are also highly uncertain .",
    "if the outflowing gas originates in the accretion disk , then it may be relatively close to the central engine ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and interior to the broad emission - line region .",
    "on the other hand , if the absorbing gas is a thermal wind driven off the obscuring torus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , then it will lie at distances of roughly 1 pc , be external to the broad - line region , but probably interior to the narrow - line region .",
    "studies of the x - ray absorption variability ( ngc  3516 ; @xcite ) show that at least some of the gas does lie at distances approaching 1 pc .",
    "variability of uv absorption in ngc  4151 suggests distances of tens of parsecs for the absorbing gas ( @xcite ) , and even greater distances for the associated uv absorption seen in some quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ , we obtained high - resolution uv spectra below 1200   covering the o  vi  @xmath1 resonance doublet and the high - order lyman lines .",

    "the predicted column densities for  and  in this model are also rather low , although easily detectable .",
    "we note that the uv continuum in the current  observation is a factor of @xmath196 brighter than that observed with the fos in 1996 .",
    "if we assume that any variations since then are simply due to changes in flux with a constant column density of absorbing gas , then we would have expected the gas in 1996 to be responding to an ionization parameter of @xmath197 .",
    "this would then predict  and  column densities of @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively , with corresponding equivalent widths of the blue components of each doublet ( for optically thin gas ) of 0.2   and 0.16  .",
    "while these are still lower than the observed values in the fos spectrum , ( @xmath200 and @xmath201   for  and , respectively ) given the uncertainties in the spectral energy distribution and other potentially variable factors , we find the agreement quite good .",
    "the covering fraction and line depth of component # 1 is consistent with its absorbing only the continuum flux and none of the emission - line flux in ngc  7469 .",
    "its high ionization parameter , and its likely identification with the same gas responsible for the x - ray absorption suggests that it is much higher ionization than component # 2 . taken together , these points imply that component # 1 lies very close to the central engine , possible interior to the broad emission line region .",
    "this would favor its association with an accretion disk wind , rather than a thermally driven wind emanating from the obscuring torus .",
    "in constrast , the high covering fraction of component # 2 clearly places it exterior to both the blr and continuum regions as would be expected for the thermally driven winds of krolik & kriss ( 1995 ; 2001 ) .",
    "overall , in this one object we may be seeing absorption from both a torus wind and a disk wind .",
    "our high - resolution far - ultraviolet spectrum of ngc  7469 obtained with  shows broad emission lines of , , o  vi , and he  ii , as well as possible emission from s  iv @xmath18 .",
    "intrinsic absorption in the o  vi  @xmath1 resonance doublet arises in two distinct kinematic components at systemic velocities of @xmath2  ( component # 1 ) and @xmath3  ( component # 2 ) .",
    "both components are very highly ionized with no significant  absorption detected at either velocity .",
    "component # 2 , although highly ionized , has a lower total column density than component # 1 , and it is consistent with having no associated x - ray absorption .",
    "it covers more than 90% of both the continuum and broad - line emission .",
    "component # 1 at @xmath2  is the best match in velocity to the highly ionized x - ray absorbing gas detected in the _ xmm - newton _ grating spectrum of ngc  7469 ( @xcite ) at a blueshift of @xmath202 .",
    "photoionization models for component # 1 show that for a total column density of @xmath203 and an ionization parameter of @xmath204 , the column densities of , o  vi , o  vii , and o  viii  in the  and the _ xmm - newton _ spectra can all be reproduced .",
    "component # 1 also has an extraordinarily low covering fraction of  0.5 , and is consistent with covering only the continuum emission and none of the broad - line emission .",
    "this suggests that it might arise in an accretion disk wind interior to the broad line region .",
