    "cillium , a micron scale flexible hair - like appendix , and their assembly , appear in many biological systems@xcite .",
    "mucu - ciliary transport in respiratory system and swimming of ciliated organisms like volvox and paramecium , are among the most important examples of cilia in biology @xcite . in most of their natural appearance ,",
    "the emergent synchronized motion of an assembly of many cilia is an essential key for their efficient performance . using the forces from molecular motor - proteins , an individual cilium can beat independently@xcite .",
    "it is mainly believed that the hydrodynamic interactions , can lead a collection of cilia to reach a synchronized state with propagating metachronal waves @xcite .",
    "there are some experimental observations in artificial active colloidal systems that supports the idea of hydrodynamic mediated synchronization in colloidal systems@xcite .",
    "a metachronal wave is a kind of synchronized pattern of ciliary beating that results a traveling wave on the envelop of their tips . the average flow field due to the cyclic motion of an individual cilium is neglibible but",
    ", a synchronized pattern of ciliary beating is able to either produce a net flow of the fluid in mucus or generate a swimming mechanism for the ciliated microorganisms .",
    "while maximum efficiency for synchronous motion with metachronal waves is expected @xcite , mechanism behind this wave pattern formation is not completely understood .",
    "experimental studies , show that the direction of a metachronal wave can be either parallel ( symplectic wave ) or antiparallel ( antiplectic wave ) to the power - stroke direction of an individual cilia @xcite .",
    "there are many recent works that considered the problem of two or many cilia and investigated their synchronizations @xcite . as to our knowledge , in most of the recent works , the curved geometry of the ciliated body is not considered .",
    "the roughness of the body has an essential influence on the hydrodynamic interactions . in this article",
    "we aim to study the emergence of metachronal waves in a collection of cilia attached to the peripheral of a cylindrically curved body . for this purpose",
    ", we first introduce a simplified hydrodynamic model that can capture the hydrodynamics of a single cilium and then study the motion of their collection attached to a cylindrical body .",
    "in order to study the motion of an assembly of cilia , we start by defining our mechanical model for a single cilium .",
    "the ciliary motion composes of effective and recovery strokes that form an asymmetric cycle . as a result of such asymmetry ,",
    "a cilium experiences different friction forces during its first and second semi cycles .",
    "this asymmetry is essential in allowing the cilium to produce a net flow of fluid along its stroke direction .",
    "it is shown that the flow pattern associated to a beating cilium can be modeled by the flow corresponding to a rigid sphere moving along an elliptic trajectory near a rigid and no - slip wall @xcite .",
    "the sphere resembles the hydrodynamic center of the cilium and the wall stands for the body on which cilium has been attached . to introduce the geometrical characteristics of a single cilium ,",
    "let us start with a cilium attached to a flat wall .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a schematic view of the model and its geometrical parameters . in a reference frame located on the wall ,",
    "the elliptic orbit is characterized by @xmath0 parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the lengths of semi - major and semi - minor axises are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the position vector of the center of ellipse is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the rigid wall is placed at @xmath8 .",
    "the plane of the ellipse and the rigid wall are not parallel , the plane of ellipse is rotated with an angle @xmath6 around its semi - major axis . projecting the orbit on the plane",
    ", the semi - major axis is tilted with an angle @xmath5 with respect to @xmath9axis . for later use",
    "we denote the eccentricity of the orbit by @xmath10 .",
    "instantaneous dynamical state of the sphere moving on this orbit , is denoted by an angle @xmath11 .    based on an intuitional argument , we can easily distinguish the direction of average flow produced by a cilium . to have a net flow , it is essential to have a tilted elliptic trajectory ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "motion of sphere in a part of the trajectory that is far from the wall , determines the flow direction , thus the flow pattern is in the same direction as the sphere has in its motion when it is far from wall . for a typical trajectory shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the direction of the flow points from right to left .    in this article",
    "we aim to investigate the curvature of the ciliated body and its role in the dynamic of cilia . in order to attack this problem",
    ", we consider a @xmath13 dimensional array of @xmath14 cilia , attached to a circle around the cylinder . the circle is wrapped around the cylinder and it has the same radius @xmath15 as cylinder . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , two adjacent cilia are connected with an arc length @xmath16 .",
    "the geometrical parameters of each cilia can be expressed with respect to a flat wall that is locally tangent to the cylinder . in the case",
    "that the length of each cilim , is comparable with this arc - length , we expect to see hydrodynamical effects due to the curvature of body . in the next section",
    "we will summarize all of the equations that are necessary to describe the dynamics of a coupled system of cilia .",
    "let us consider two cilia , each represented by a moving sphere with radii @xmath17 and position vectors given by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and corresponding parameters for their elliptic trajectories .",
    "hereafter we consider similar cilia that have same geometrical and dynamical properties . at micrometer scale where the dissipative effects dominate over inertial effects , it is a known fact that the governing equations for two interacting colloidal particles ( here two cilia ) can be written as linear relations between the @xmath20 particle s velocity @xmath21 and the hydrodynamic forces acting on particles denoted by @xmath22 . in terms of their cartesian components , we have : @xmath23 where greek letters denote the cartesian components of the vectors .",
    "the hydrodynamic kernel @xmath24 contains information about the geometry of the system : radii of spheres , their separation and their distances to the wall . assuming that the sphere radius , @xmath17 , is much smaller than all other lengths in system , we can write an approximate form for the component of the hydrodynamic kernel in a semi infinite domain confined by a rigid wall . for @xmath25",
    ", we have @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and we have assumed that @xmath30 . here @xmath31 is defined as : @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , we have : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "let us continue our discussion about the case of two interacting cilia near a flat wall , then we will show how the effects due to the curvature of the body can be considered .",
    "in addition to the above hydrodynamic equations , we should provide some information about the internal forces inside each cilium that drive its beating .",
    "in addition to constraining forces that enforce the particle to move on elliptic orbit , there is also tangential force that results the motion along orbit . denoting the unit vector tangent to the trajectory by @xmath36 , the tangential component of the force reads as : @xmath37 . in general ,",
    "the tangential force is related to the velocity of sphere along its trajectory @xmath38 . in linear response regime ,",
    "an equation like @xmath39 captures the dynamics of a cilium . here",
    "@xmath40 is the stall force and it is the amount of external force necessary to stop the motion of a beating cilium . a free cilium that is not affected by any external force , moves with velocity @xmath41 . in this linear response approximation , two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath42",
    "are related to the microscopic details of the cilium . defining the stiffness of the cilium by @xmath43",
    ", we will use a numerical value for this parameter as @xmath44 @xcite .     and @xmath5 .",
    "different values of @xmath45 are shown by points on a unit circle .",
    "the synchronized states of two cilia are represented by the long time value of their phase differences , @xmath46 , and are shown by bolded dots on the circles .",
    "numerical parameters are : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . ]",
    "let us now explain how can we take into account the curvature effects . in order to study the curvature ,",
    "the hydrodynamic kernel should be replaced . in a confined space that is limited by a curved wall ,",
    "the above mentioned kernel is no longer valid .",
    "we proceed by an approximate scheme to consider the curvature effects . here",
    "we assume that for two neighboring cilia , there is an effective plane that can be used for constructing the image system .",
    "this effective wall , is a wall that is locally tangent to the curved body at the mid point of two cilia .",
    "we can use the results of flat - wall confinement , to obtain the approximate interaction between two adjacent cilia .",
    "it is obvious that with this approximation , we do not expect to see any curvature effect in the motion of two cilia .",
    "the curvature , in this approximation , has no effect on the dynamics of two cilia .",
    "this approximation can only include non trivial curvature effects to the motion of many cilia ( more than two ) , attached to the cylinder .",
    "the validity of this approximation is guaranteed for the case where @xmath52 , this is also the case of real situation in ciliated body . to obtain the dynamics of two coupled cilia",
    ", one should note that in a way that we have parametrized the orbits , the kinematics of each cilium can be expressed by a single phase denoted by @xmath53 .",

    "before studying the wave propagation in ciliated curved body , we consider the dynamics of two coupled cilia . recalling the geometry of elliptic orbits , angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 , play important role in the dynamics of coupled cilia .",
    "numerical solutions to the equations for two interacting cilia , show that for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( orbits are parallel and perpendicular to the wall respectively ) , the long time dynamics of cilia does not show any correlations in their beating patterns . in this case , the hydrodynamic mediated interactions between two cilia , act in an incoherent way and the state of motion for each cilium is independent from the other .",
    "this result is consistent with previous works of beating cilia near a flat wall @xcite .",
