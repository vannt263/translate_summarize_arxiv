    "hvfs are present , at least in ca  ii  ir , in almost all sne  ia with early spectra , but they have different strength and duration . some sne also show si  ii  hvfs .",
    "spectroscopically , hvfs could be due to abundance or density enhancements .",
    "an abundance enhancement would be a property of the explosion .",
    "however , @xcite show that even  extreme abundance enhancements , such that si and ca dominate the outer regions of the ejecta , can not produce sufficiently strong hvfs . that was a 1d test for sn  1999ee , where the hvfs are not the strongest .",
    "3d models do show fingers of burned material penetrating to high velocities , but then this material has a covering factor @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , abundance enhancements alone can only partially explain the observations at best , and density enhancements must also be invoked .",
    "density enhancements would increase the caii  and si  ii  line opacity not only directly , but also indirectly through recombination in the hvfs ( ca and si are typically triply ionised in the outemost parts of the ejecta ) .",
    "density enhancements may themselves be a property of the explosion : large - scale angular fluctuations , similar to the fingers of burned material in a deflagration , density blobs offering different covering factors depending on the orientation , or the effect of the onset of a delayed detonation . the fact that polarisation was observed in coincidence with the hvfs in sn  2001el @xcite indicates that hvfs are due to 3d effects .",
    "alternatively , density enhancements may be the result of the interaction of the sn ejecta with csm . in this case",
    ", constraints can be placed on the nature of the csm itself .",
    "first , the csm must offer a large angular size to the ejecta , otherwise orientation effects would imply that only some sne should show hvfs .",
    "secondly , any csm must be located near the sn for it to affect the spectrum immediately after the explosion .",
    "the csm closest to the wd is the accretion disc . if the disc is responsible for the hvfs , it must be thick compared to the size of the wd @xcite .",
    "variability in strength and duration of the interaction may depend on both disc size and viewing angle .",
    "alternatively , the csm may be a wind emanating from either star in the system , the strength of the interaction depending on the wind properties .",
    "however , for sn  1999ee @xcite find that as much as @xmath43 of h - rich material may have accumulated on top of the sn ejecta , and an even larger value was obtained by @xcite for sn  2003du .",
    "the implied wind mass loss rate seems unreasonably high for a fast wd wind ( @xmath44yr@xmath4 ) , but it is high also for a slow red giant wind ( @xmath45yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "since the material must surround the system , one possibilty is enhanced mass loss from the system through the @xmath46 point .",
    "this should take place at a much higher rate than in single stars .",
    "one property that would distinguish a density enhancement resulting from the explosion from one due to csm is the composition of the added material .",
    "@xcite show that the narrow , unblended ca  ii  ir hvfs in sn  1999ee can be reproduced with a density enhancement of sn - composition material , but that h - rich material helps to reproduce the overall line width , so this may be a case where the two effects coexist .",
    "unblended hvfs are also observed in sn  2001el .",
    "the case of sn  2000cx , with a double set of hvfs , is also interesting .",
    "possibly , the unblended hvfs are due to blobs of material generated in the explosion , while broad hvfs are the result of csm accretion .",
    "if the 3d structure of the ejecta is such that the density profile varies with direction , it may be expected that the range of velocities of the swept - up csm could be broader than that of the blobs .",
    "a study of the composition of the csm could reveal the nature of sne  ia progenitors .",
