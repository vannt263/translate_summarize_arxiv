    "the study of proton - nucleus @xmath1 collisions is important because they are tractable intermediaries between @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions , when intense interest exists in discovering the extent to which the dense medium created in an @xmath3 collision differ from that of linear superpositions of @xmath2 collisions .",
    "one of the properties of @xmath0 collisions is that the momentum of the leading baryon in the projectile fragmentation region is degraded , a phenomenon commonly referred to , somewhat inappropriately , as baryon stopping .",
    "such a transference of baryon number from the fragmentation to the central region contributes to the increase of matter density at mid - rapidity , thereby raising the likelihood of the formation of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "thus it is important to understand the process of baryon momentum degradation and its dependence on nuclear size or centrality .",
    "since it is not feasible to perform first - principle parameter - free calculations of the momentum degradation at this point , experimental guidance is of crucial importance .",
    "recently , several experiments have produced useful data on the subject , in particular , e910 and e941 at the ags , and na49 at the sps @xcite .",
    "it is the @xmath4 dependences of the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 that we shall focus on ; moreover , their dependences on centrality will guide us in our determination of the nuclear effect on baryon momentum degradation .",
    "the degradation of baryon momentum has been studied in various approaches before @xcite-@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the investigations are done at the nucleon level , while in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the string model is the basis . since it is questionable that the concept of color strings can be relevant in heavy - ion collisions where the abundance of color charges in the overlap region renders unlikely the development of constricted color flux tubes @xcite , our approach in this paper will be on the various levels of the constituents of the nucleon that are consistent with the parton model .",
    "more specifically , we shall use the valon model @xcite-@xcite to keep track of the momenta of the constituents and the recombination model @xcite to describe the hadronization of the partons .",
    "the valons play a role in the collision problem as the constituent quarks do in the bound - state problem .",
    "thus a nucleon has three valons which carry all the momentum of the nucleon , while each valon has one valence quark and its own sea quarks and gluons .",
    "although soft processes are non - perturbative , the valon model ( including recombination ) nevertheless provides a systematic way of calculating all subprocesses that contribute to a particular inclusive process .",
    "some of the subprocesses can be identified with certain diagrams in other approaches , e.g. , baryon junction and diquark breaking terms @xcite .",
    "the valon distributions in the proton will be determined by fitting the parton distributions at low @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of the nuclear medium on the valon distribution of the proton projectile will involve two parameters , one characterizing the momentum degradation and the other flavor flipping .",
    "the color indices are all averaged over , since multiple gluon interactions , as the projectile traverses the target nucleus , are numerous and uncomputable .",
    "their effects are , however , quantified in terms of the number , @xmath8 , of target nucleons that participate in the @xmath0 collision .",
    "for that reason it is important that the experimental data must have centrality selection expressible in terms of the average @xmath9 .    the inclusive process @xmath10 has been studied before in the valon model @xcite .",
    "however , the pertinent data available at that time had no centrality cuts and were for fixed @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "now , na49 has @xmath12-@xmath13 data on the production of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the proton fragmentation region ( with contribution from the nuclear target subtracted ) for various values of @xmath9 @xcite . to extract more information from these refined data",
    "we have improved our formulation of the valon model , allowing for momentum degradation of each of the valons independently and for changes in their flavors .",
    "the effect on the nucleon momentum distributions can be calculated and the effective degradation length deduced .    in sec .",
    "ii we determine the valon and parton distribution functions from the published distribution functions at low @xmath7 . the valon model for @xmath0 collisions",
    "is then discussed in sec .",
    "iii , in which momentum degradation is formulated . in sec .",
    "iv we consider in detail the projectile fragmentation process and the subsequent process of quark recombination so that the inclusive distribution of nucleons can be calculated .",
    "the net proton and neutron distributions are then calculated and compared to the experimental data in sec .",
    "v. predictions for pion production in the proton fragmentation region are made in sec .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "the distribution functions of valons and partons have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . they were , however , determined by fitting the muon and neutrino scattering data of the late 70s .",
    "we now have modern parton distributions from various groups at various values of @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore appropriate for us to revisit the problem and determine the valon distribution functions in light of the new parton distribution functions .    in the valon model a proton",
    "is considered to consist of three valons ( @xmath16 ) , which have the same flavors as the valence quarks ( @xmath17 ) that they individually contain .",
    "thus a valon may be regarded as a parton cluster whose structure can be probed at high @xmath7 , but the structure of a nucleon itself in a low-@xmath11 scattering problem is described in terms of the valons . as in the parton model we work in a high - momentum frame so that it is sensible to use the momentum fractions of the constituents . reserving @xmath18 for the momentum fraction of a quark , we use @xmath19 to denote the momentum fraction of a valon . in this paper @xmath19 never denotes rapidity .",

    "the favored distribution @xmath50 has two parts , valence and sea , while the unfavored distribution @xmath51 has only sea .",
    "the valence part is also referred to as the non - singlet component , @xmath52 , so we may write @xmath53 at high @xmath7 both @xmath54 and @xmath55 can separately be determined in perturbative qcd .",
    "however , since low-@xmath7 parton distributions are now available by extrapolation , and especially since we shall apply the valon model to low-@xmath11 processes ( and therefore at low @xmath7 ) , we use phenomenological forms for @xmath54 and @xmath55 at low @xmath7 with parameters to be determined by the low-@xmath7 parton distributions .",

    "the normalization of @xmath62 at low @xmath18 is a blemish , but is acceptable since we shall use the valence quark distributions mainly in the large-@xmath18 region . besides",
    ", the reliability of an extrapolation of high-@xmath7 deep inelastic scattering data to low @xmath7 can always be called into question .",

    "@xcite based on muon - scattering data at @xmath67 analyzed by duke and roberts @xcite ; there we had @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) , our present result means that @xmath70 and @xmath71 at large @xmath19 , as opposed to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , for the previous result .",
    "the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.13 ] ) suggest that @xmath52 is highly peaked near @xmath76 , according to eq .",
    "( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "that is as it should be , since @xmath7 is only about twice the value of @xmath77 and thus not much evolution .",
    "if there were no evolution , i.  e. , @xmath78 , then @xmath79 would be @xmath80 and @xmath81 , a situation indicating no probing of the valons .",
    "what we have at @xmath82 gives only a modest degree of resolution of the valon structure , and @xmath83 is changed from @xmath80 to @xmath84 in the large @xmath19 region , while @xmath85 becomes non - vanishing .",
    "these are the valence and sea quark distributions that we shall use for nucleon production at low @xmath11 in the following .",
    "the valon model for inclusive reactions is basically a @xmath86-channel description of particle production in contradistinction from the regge - gribov approach @xcite which is essentially based on cutting @xmath87-channel exchanges in elastic amplitudes .",
    "the two approaches are roughly complementary in that the former can best describe the fragmentation region , while the latter is more suitable for the central region .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the pion inclusive cross section in the proton fragmentation region has a @xmath4 dependence that is very similar to the quark distribution in the proton @xcite .",
    "that similarity has been reconfirmed more recently in @xmath0 collisions by the e910 experiment @xcite even at the relatively low energy of @xmath88 .",
    "it suggests that the proton structure is highly relevant to the spectra of particles produced in the fragmentation region .",
    "the connection between the quark distribution and the pion inclusive distribution was first put on a calculable basis by the recombination model @xcite , which was subsequently improved in the framework of the valon model @xcite .",
    "the idea of recombination as a basis for hadronization in hadronic collisions is eminently reasonable , since for a pion to be detected at @xmath89 , say , it is far less costly to have a quark at @xmath90 coalescing with an antiquark at @xmath91 , each @xmath92 , to form a pion at @xmath93 , as compared to the fragmentation process for which a quark or diquark must first have @xmath94 . in quark jets ,",
    "fragmentation is reasonable because hadronization is initiated by a leading quark , but it is less persuasive when adapted to hadronic fragmentation unless the projectile momentum resides entirely in a quark or diquark @xcite , contrary to ochs observation of the relevance of the canonical quark distributions .",
    "the @xmath86-channel treatment of relating quark distributions to inclusive hadron distributions in @xmath2 collisions essentially regards the effect of the opposite - going initial proton as unimportant , an approximation that can only be justified in the fragmentation regions due to short - range correlation in rapidity .",
    "thus the valon model , as it has been developed up to now , is not expected to be applicable to the central regions , where the interaction between the two incident particles is of paramount importance . for @xmath0 collisions",
    "even the factorization of the fragmentation properties is not entirely valid , since the hadron distributions are known to depend on centrality or target size .",
    "this is the problem that we shall treat in this paper in the framework of the valon model .",
    "more specifically , we shall consider the problem of momentum degradation of the valons due to the nuclear medium .",
    "recombination occurs outside the nucleus and is therefore unaffected .",
    "the na49 data on @xmath12-@xmath13 collisions are presented in terms of two mean values , @xmath9 , of the number of participating nucleons in the target : @xmath95 for central collisions and @xmath96 for non - central collisions @xcite .",
    "we assume a poissonian fluctuation from that mean with the distribution @xmath97 which is normalized by @xmath98 where we have excluded the @xmath99 term , since it is necessary for @xmath100 in order to have a collision .",
    "thus @xmath8 is the number of nucleons in the nucleus that suffer inelastic collisions in any given event , @xmath8 being an integer .",
    "that is the counting on the target side , while on the projectile side we count in terms of the valons .",
    "let the @xmath101th valon encounter @xmath102 collisions . in general",
    ", the total valonic collisions is bounded by @xmath103 the upper bound occurs only when all three valons participate in each of the struck nucleon , while the lower limit is for only one valon per struck nucleon . in the appendix",
    "we shall show that the data favor the lower bounds , so for simplicity we proceed in the following with the assumption @xmath104 it is useful to interpret this in the @xmath87-channel picture .",
    "the incident proton is represented by three constituents , each of which exchanges @xmath102 ladders with @xmath102 target nucleons so that the overall diagram is highly non - planar .",
    "cutting the ladders gives rise to the particles produced in the @xmath86 channel , mostly in the central region .",
    "focusing on the evolution of the valons , we first assume that the three valons interact with the target independently , since they are loosely bound to form the proton , just as the nucleons are in a deuteron .",
    "if we denote the degradation effect of the nucleus on the @xmath101th valon by @xmath105 , then we can write the evolution equation on the valon distribution as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the valon distribution function after @xmath108 interactions with the nucleus .",

    "iii we have considered the problem of describing @xmath8 collisions with the target nucleons in terms of the number of collisions that each valon experiences . with the _",

    "we have used the @xmath233 given in ( [ a6 ] ) to calculate @xmath292 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as in secs .",
    "iv and v. the only difference from before is that we now have one additional parameter @xmath12 in ( [ a2 ] ) to adjust , which controls the number of valonic collisions above @xmath414 .",
    "our best fit of the data , as in fig .  5 , yields @xmath415 with the values of @xmath282 and @xmath165 being essentially the same as in eq.([5.16 ] ) .",
