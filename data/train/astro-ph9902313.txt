    "the double - nucleus galaxy ngc6240 is outstanding in several respects : its infrared h@xmath2 2.121@xmath3 m and [ feii ] 1.644@xmath3 m line luminosities and the ratio of h@xmath2 to bolometric luminosities are the largest currently known ( van der werf et al .",
    "its huge far - infrared luminosity of @xmath4 ( wright et al",
    ".  1984 ) comprises nearly all of its bolometric luminosity .",
    "hence , owing to its low redshift of @xmath5=0.024 , ngc6240 is one of the nearest members of the class of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter ulirgs ) .",
    ", most authors now attribute an ir luminosity @xmath6 to ngc6240 rendering it a lirg instead of a ulirg ] its optical morphology ( e.g. , zwicky et al .",
    "1961 , fried & schulz 1983 ) and its large stellar velocity dispersion of 360 km / s ( among the highest values ever found in the center of a galaxy : e.g. , doyon et al .",
    "1994 ) suggest that it is a merging system on its way to become an elliptical . like other ulirgs",
    ", the object contains a compact , luminous co(1 - 0 ) emitting core of molecular gas ( solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) . within this core most of the ultimate power source of",
    "the fir radiation appears to be hidden .    there is now growing evidence that lirgs are predominantly powered by star - formation and that the agn contribution increases with fir luminosity ( e.g. , shier et al .",
    "1996 , lutz et al .",
    "1998a , rigopolou et al . 1998",
    "; see sanders & mirabel 1996 and genzel et al .",
    "1998 for recent reviews ) while essentially all of the hylirgs contain qsos ( e.g. , hines et al . 1995 and these proceedings ) . in the ` transition region ' around",
    "@xmath7 it then requires a careful object - by - object analysis to find out the majour power source .",
    "concerning ngc6240 , at least four scenarios have been suggested : heating of dust by a superluminous starburst , by an agn , by an old stellar population , and by uv radiation from molecular cloud collisions . in particular ,",
    "previous hints for an agn included ( i ) the strength of nir recombination lines ( de poy et al .",
    "1986 , depending on the applied reddening correction , though ) , ( ii ) the presence of compact bright radio cores ( carral et al .",
    "1990 but see colbert et al .",
    "1994 ) , ( iii ) the discovery of a high - excitation core in the southern nucleus with _ hst _ ( barbieri et al . 1994 , 1995 , rafanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the detection of the [ oiv]25.9@xmath3 m emission line with iso ( lutz et al .",
    "1996  but see lutz et al .",
    "1998b who discovered this line in a number of starburst galaxies ; egami , this meeting ) .",
    "x - rays are a powerful tool to investigate both , the presence of an agn and starburst - superwind activity .",
    "it is the aim of the present contribution to review briefly and discuss our findings of evidence for a hard x - ray component in the pspc spectrum of ngc6240 ( schulz et al .",
    "1998 , skbb hereafter ) and the detection of luminous extended emission based on hri data ( komossa et al .",
    "1998 ) in combination with the discovery of an fek line and hard x - ray component by ( first reported by mitsuda 1995 ) .",
    "luminosities given below were calculated using @xmath8 km / s / mpc .",
    "in our analysis of pspc data of ngc6240 we tested a large variety of models to explain the x - ray spectrum ( skbb ) .",
    "_ one - component _ fits turned out to be unlikely .",
    "e.g. , a single raymond - smith model requires a huge absorbing column along the line - of - sight , the consequence being an intrinsic ( absorption corrected ) luminosity of @xmath9 erg / s , almost impossible to reach in any starburst - superwind scenario .",
    "the one model that does _ not _ require excess absorption is a single black body .",
    "although physically implausible , this description does allow to derive a lower limit on the intrinsically emitted x - ray luminosity which any model has to explain : @xmath10 erg / s in the ( 0.1 - 2.4 ) kev band ( fricke & papaderos 1996 obtained 3.810@xmath11 erg / s by fitting a thermal bremsstrahlung model and allowing for some excess absorption ) .",
    "successful _ two - component _ models require the presence of a _ hard _ x - ray component , in form of either very hot thermal emission ( @xmath12 7 kev ) or a powerlaw.solar abundances in the raymond - smith component instead of single - component models of very subsolar abundances .",
    "in particular , buote & fabian conclude that the necessity of a second x - ray component can not be circumvented by details of the modelling of the fel emission . ]    due to its large luminosity of several 10@xmath11 erg / s we interpret the hard component to arise from an agn . both , the essential lack of non - x - ray evidence for an _ unobscured _ agn , and the high equivalent width of the fek line observed by ( e.g. , mitsuda et al .",
    "1995 ) suggest we see the agn mainly in scattered light .",
    "indeed , the x - ray spectrum can be successfully described by a ` warm scatterer ' ( cf .",
    "4 of komossa et al .",
    "1998 ) , highly ionized material seen in reflection which could also explain the strong fek line seen by _ asca_. our model , which was suggested to explain the hard component , is quite similar to the one suggested by netzer et al . ( 1998 ) who , however , explained the _",
    "spectrum in terms of scattering . in this respect , we emphasize that the widely _ extended _ x - ray component detected with the hri ( komossa et al .",
    "1998 ; cf .",
    "next sect . ) is likely of different origin , given the low efficiency of a hugely extended scattering mirror ( skbb ) .    with an x - ray luminosity in scattered emission of a few 10@xmath11",
    "erg / s one obtains an _ intrinsic _ luminosity of order 10@xmath13 erg / s , depending on the covering factor of the scatterer .",
    "various fits of spectra ( e.g. , mitsuda 1995 , kii et al .",
    "1997 , iwasawa 1998 , netzer et al .",
    "1998 , nakagawa , these proceedings ) revealing the extension of the hard component up to 10 kev support this conclusion ; the various approaches differ in the description of the soft component(s ) and the amount of absorption of the hard component , though . in any case",
    ", the agn contributes an appreciable fraction of the total @xmath14 erg / s .",
    "if @xmath15 a black hole mass of @xmath16 results .",
    "ngc6240 is expected to form an @xmath17 elliptical galaxy rather than a giant elliptical after having completed its merging epoch ( shier & fischer 1997 ) .",
    "however , to match the relation @xmath18 ( lauer et al .",
    "1997 ) for the evolved elliptical the black hole has still to grow by an order of magnitude which would require another @xmath19 yrs of accretion while the merger is settling down .",
    "alternatively , the present accretion rate could be below the eddington rate .",
    "the hri _ images _ ( komossa et al .",
    "1998 ) reveal that part of the huge x - ray luminosity arises in a roughly spherical source with strong ( @xmath20 above background ) emission out to a radius of 20  ( @xmath2114 kpc ; fig .",
    "[ ovl ] ) .",
    "hence , ngc6240 is the host of one of the _ most luminous extended _ x - ray sources in isolated galaxies ( see fig . [ lxlb ] where @xmath22 is compared with a sample of elliptical galaxies and arp220 ) .",
    "analytical estimates based on the mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) models show that the extended emission can be explained by superwind - shell interaction from the central starburst ( skbb ) .",
    "a puzzle is the high circular symmetry of the x - ray bubble , in contrast to the bicone - symmetry expected in a wind - driven supershell scenario so that it seems worthwhile to look for further potential contributors to the x - ray emission .",
    "an additional small contribution may come from a wind induced by the large velocity dispersion of 350 km / s ( lester & gaffney 1994 ) leading to shocks in the gas expelled by the red giant population .",
    "another interesting point is that the extended x - ray bubbles around elliptical galaxies are usually brighter in the inflow phases or ` when caught in the verge of experiencing their central cooling catastrophe ' ( ciotti et al .",
    "1991 , friaca & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "although time scales and details for an ongoing merger are certainly different , it is conceivable that ngc6240 experiences a lack of heating when a majour starburst period has ended . in this case",
    ", a cooling flow would commence boosting @xmath23 and presumably shock heating the ism in the central kiloparsecs .",
    "due to fragmentation , shock velocities could be enhanced causing the liner like line ratios in the two nuclei ( gravitational centers ) and , with lower velocities , excite the molecular cloud complex between the nuclei leading to the extreme h@xmath2 luminosity found there ( van der werf et al.1993 ) .",
