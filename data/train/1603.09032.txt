    "an undirected graph is formed by a set of vertices and a set of undirected edges between pairs of vertices . a cycle ( or a loop ) of such a graph is a closed path connected by a set of different edges .",
    "a feedback vertex set ( fvs ) is a subset of vertices intersecting with every cycle of this graph @xcite .",
    "if all the vertices in a fvs are deleted from the graph , there will be no cycle in the remaining subgraph .",
    "the fvs problem aims at constructing a fvs of cardinality ( size ) not exceeding certain pre - specified value or proving the nonexistence of it @xcite .",
    "this problem has wide practical applications , such as combinatorial circuit design @xcite , deadlock recovery in operating systems @xcite , network dynamics analysis @xcite , and epidemic spreading process @xcite .",
    "the fvs problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in the nondeterministic polynomial - complete ( np - complete ) complexity class @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed ( yet not rigorously proven ) that there is no way to solve this problem by a complete algorithm in time bounded by a polynomial function of the number of vertices or edges in the graph .",
    "so far , the most efficient complete algorithm is able to construct a fvs of global minimum cardinality in an exponential time of the order @xmath7 by solving the equivalent maximum induced forest problem @xcite .",
    "many heuristic algorithms have been developed to solve it approximately .",
    "these algorithms are incomplete in the sense that they may fail for some input graph instances , but they have the merit of reaching a fvs solution very quickly if they succeed . one famous heuristic algorithm is feedback of bafna and co - authors @xcite , which is guaranteed , for any input graph , to construct a fvs with cardinality at most two times the minimum value . in a more recent paper , two of the present authors demonstrated that a heuristic algorithm based on the idea of simulated annealing extensively outperforms feedback on random graphs and finite - dimensional lattices @xcite . the fvs problem has also been treated by statistical physics methods and the associated belief propagation - guided decimation ( bpd ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "this physics - inspired message - passing algorithm outperforms simulated annealing to some extent and constructs a fvs of cardinality being very close to the global minimum value .",
    "the spin glass model for the fvs problem was proposed in @xcite by implementing the global cycle constraints as a set of local edge constraints .",
    "this spin glass model was then studied by mean field theory at the level of replica symmetry ( rs ) without taking into account the possibility of spin glass phase transitions . at low temperatures ( equivalently , high inverse temperatures @xmath8 ) ,",
    "the rs mean field equations can not reach a self - consistent solution @xcite , which indicates that the rs theory is valid only at sufficiently high temperatures and that the property of the fvs spin glass model at low temperature is much more complex than that at high temperature . in the present paper ,",
    "we continue to study this spin glass model at finite temperatures and at the zero temperature limit using the first - step replica - symmetry - breaking ( 1rsb ) mean field theory @xcite .",
    "we mainly work on the ensemble of regular random ( rr ) graphs , and in some cases also consider the ensemble of erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs .",
    "the degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges attached to the vertex ( i.e. , the number of nearest neighbors ) .",
    "each vertex in a rr graph has the same degree @xmath9 , but the edges in the graph are connected completely at random . on the other hand , an er graph",

    "the existence of two distinct spin glass phases for dense rr graphs may have significant algorithmic consequences .",
    "in the final part of this paper we consider the @xmath17 limit of the 1rsb mean field theory ( sec .",
    "[ sec : t01rsb ] ) to estimate the ensemble - averaged minimum fvs cardinality .",
    "for rr graphs these theoretical results improve over the corresponding results obtained through the rs mean field theory , and they are in good agreement with numerical results obtained by the bpd algorithm",
