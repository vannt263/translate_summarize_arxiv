    "axially symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations corresponding to disklike configurations of matter are of great astrophysical interest , since they can be used as models of galaxies or accretion disks .",
    "these solutions can be static or stationary and with or without radial pressure .",
    "solutions for static disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "disks with radial tension have been considered in @xcite , and models of disks with electric fields @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , and both magnetic and electric fields have been introduced recently @xcite .",
    "solutions for self - similar static disks were analyzed by lynden - bell and pineault @xcite , and lemos @xcite .",
    "the superposition of static disks with black holes were considered by lemos and letelier @xcite , and klein @xcite .",
    "also bick , lynden - bell and katz @xcite studied static disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes and bick , lynden - bell and pichon @xcite found an infinity number of new static solutions . for a recent survey on relativistic gravitating disks ,",
    "see @xcite .    the principal method to generate",
    "the above mentioned solution is the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method .",
    "one of the main problem of the solutions generated by using this simple method is that usually the matter content of the disk is anisotropic i.e. , the radial pressure is different from the azimuthal pressure . in most of the solutions",
    "the radial pressure is null .",
    "this made these solutions rather unphysical .",
    "even though , one can argue that when no radial pressure is present stability can be achieved if we have two circular streams of particles moving in opposite directions ( counter rotating hypothesis , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in this article we apply the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method on spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations in isotropic coordinates to generate static disks made of a _ perfect fluid _ ,",
    "i.e. , with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure and also disks of perfect fluid surrounded by an halo made of perfect fluid matter",
    ".    the article is divided as follows .",
    "section ii gives an overview of the `` displace , cut and reflect '' method .",
    "also we present the basic equations used to calculate the main physical variables of the disks . in section iii",
    "we apply the formalism to obtain the simplest model of disk , that is based on schwarzschild s vacuum solution in isotropic coordinate .",
    "the generated class of disks is made of a perfect fluid with well behaved density and pressure .",
    "section iv presents some models of disks with halos obtained from different known exact solutions of einstein s field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates . in section v we give some examples of disks with halo generated from spheres composed of fluid layers .",
    "section vi is devoted to discussion of the results .",

    "the material content of the disk will be described by functions that are distributions with support on the disk .",
    "the method can be divided in the following steps that are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_schem1 ] : first , in a space wherein we have a compact source of gravitational field , we choose a surface ( in our case , the plane @xmath4 ) that divides the space in two pieces : one with no singularities or sources and the other with the sources .",
    "then we disregard the part of the space with singularities and use the surface to make an inversion of the nonsingular part of the space .",
    "this results in a space with a singularity that is a delta function with support on @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure is mathematically equivalent to make the transformation @xmath5 , with @xmath0 constant . in the einstein tensor",
    "we have first and second derivatives of @xmath6 . since @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the heaviside function and the dirac distribution .",
    "therefore the einstein field equations will separate in two different pieces @xcite : one valid for @xmath11 ( the usual einstein s equations ) , and other involving distributions with an associated energy - momentum tensor , @xmath12 , with support on @xmath4 . for the metric ( [ eq_line2 ] ) , the non - zero components of @xmath13 are @xmath14 \\mbox { , } \\label{eq_qtt}\\\\ q^r_r & = q^{\\varphi}_{\\varphi } = \\frac{1}{16 \\pi } \\left [ -b^{zz}+g^{zz}(b^t_t+b^r_r+b^z_z ) \\right ] \\mbox { , } \\label{eq_qrr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denote the jump of the first derivatives of the metric tensor on the plane @xmath4 , @xmath16 and the other quantities are evaluated at @xmath17 .",
    "the `` true '' surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk can be written as @xmath18 , thus the surface energy density @xmath19 and the radial and azimuthal pressures or tensions @xmath20 read : @xmath21 note that when the same procedure is applied to an axially symmetric spacetime in weyl coordinates we have @xmath22 , i.e. , we have no radial pressure or tension .",
    "this procedure in principle can be applied to any spacetime solution of the einstein equations with or without source ( stress tensor ) .",
    "the application to a static sphere of perfect fluid is schematized in fig .",
    "[ fig_schem2 ] .",
    "the sphere is displaced and cut by a distance @xmath0 less then its radius @xmath23 .",
    "the part of the space that contains the center of the sphere is disregarded .",
    "after the inversion of the remaining space , we end up with a disk surrounded by a cap of perfect fluid .",
    "the properties of the inner part of the disk will depend on the internal fluid solution , but if the internal spherical fluid solution is joined to the standard external schwarzschild solution , the physical properties of the outer part of the disk will be those originated from schwarzschild s vacuum solution .        in isotropic",
    "coordinates the matching at the boundary of the fluid sphere leads to four continuity conditions metric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 together with their first derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate should be continuous across the boundary .",
    "in addition , to have a compact body the pressure at the surface of the material sphere has to drop to zero . also to have a meaningfully solution the velocity of sound , @xmath26",
    "should be restricted to the interval @xmath27 .",
    "the einstein equations for a static spherically symmetric space time in isotropic coordinates for a perfect fluid source give us that density @xmath28 and pressure @xmath29 are related to the metric functions by @xmath30 \\mbox { , } \\\\ p & = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}}{8 \\pi}\\left [ \\frac{1}{4}(\\lambda')^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda'\\nu'+\\frac{1}{r}(\\lambda'+\\nu ' ) \\right ] \\mbox{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where primes indicate differentiation with respect to @xmath31 .    also static spheres composed of various layers of fluid can be used to generate disks with halos of fluid layers ( see figure [ fig_schem3 ] ) .",
    "the disk will then be composed of different axial symmetric `` pieces '' glued together .",
    "the matching conditions at the boundary of adjacent spherical fluid layers in isotropic coordinates involves four continuity conditions : the two metric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the first derivative of @xmath32 with respect to the radial coordinate , and the pressure should be continuous across the boundary . at the most external boundary ,",

    "we believe that the presented disks can be used to describe more realistic model of galaxies than most of the already studied disks since the counter rotation hypothesis is not needed to have a stable configuration .           in the table we list the seed metric coefficients , matching conditions at the boundaries and relevant physical quantities of all disks studied in this work .",
