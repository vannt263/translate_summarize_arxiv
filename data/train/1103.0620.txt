    ", this mode of molecular transport , called translocation , finds its great potentiality in the multidisciplinary field of nano - technology and biological sciences  @xcite , e.g. , in inventing nano - pore based rapid dna sequencing devices .    in typical situations , a polymer ( with @xmath0 segments ) passes through driven by the force @xmath1 acting at the pore site .",
    "the corresponding setup has been realized in most of experiments , where the charged polymers ( dnas ) are driven by the electric field , and the voltage drop is concentrated in the pore  @xcite . from the technological design perspective , one of the most important measure is the translocation time @xmath2 , i.e. , an average passage time for a polymer to go through . for this reason ,",

    "we begin by clarifying the exponents relevant to equilibrium ( static ) and near - equilibrium ( dynamic ) situations .",
    "first , the flory exponent @xmath6 characterizes the fractality of the equilibrium polymer coil whose size is given by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 : segment size ) .",
    "equally important is the dynamical exponent @xmath9 characterizing the dynamics of  critical fluctuation \" ( polymer coil )  @xcite .",

    "the latter indeed corresponds to models in most ( but not all ) of numerical simulations . by denoting the translocation time @xmath12 ,",
    "our aim is to find these dynamical exponents @xmath13 , @xmath14 relevant to the driven translocation in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "there is a growing evidence that a key element lies in the dynamical property of the polymer ; it can not respond to the driving force all at once .",
    "this becomes evident for rather weak forces @xmath15 , i.e. , the thermal energy @xmath16 divided by the equilibrium coil size @xmath17 . in what follows",
    ", we make the length , force and time dimensionless by the units @xmath8 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , with @xmath20 being the viscosity of the solvent . to analyze the case @xmath21 ,",
    "let us see the sketches of a translocating polymer where the driving force acts on the segment at the pore ( @xmath22 ) as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note that @xmath23-axis is taken to be perpendicular to the wall with the pore .",
    "the one chain end is first sucked at time @xmath24 , while the polymer keeps the equilibrium conformation in @xmath25 . by the time @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 segments have been already translocated , and the subsequent @xmath28 segments in the anterior _ cis _ side ( shaded in fig .  1 )",
    "are set in motion under the tension , while the remaining @xmath29 segments in the rear part are still at rest .",
    "although plausible , a mathematical formulation of the above picture is nontrivial . in fact , at any moment , each segment moves with its own velocity and the complete characterization of the transient process would require handling highly nonlinear equations in multi - dimensional space with excluded - volume / hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "a drastic simplification is achieved , however , by introducing the  two phase picture \" , i.e. , a moving and a quiescent domains separated by the tension front , and applying the steady - state approximation for the former ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "it amounts to say that the relevant properties of the moving domain can be captured by the representative velocity @xmath30 and the steady - state conformation of the @xmath28 segments dragged at its velocity . leaving its justification in the appendix i , we remark here that there remains only single gross variable , i.e. , the position of the front , or the boundary between the moving and the quiescent domains .",
    "this coarse - graining makes the problem analytically treatable .",
    "then , by considering the mass conservation relation , we can show that the boundary position obeys the following equation ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the line density of the segment and @xmath33 is the location of the boundary ( see appendix ii for this derivation ) .",
    "note that we first consider only the tension - propagation stage ( fig .",
    "1(b),(c),(d ) ) since this is the dominant process giving the scaling exponents in the translocation .",
    "in addition , @xmath34-th segment is just located in the boundary during the moving domain growth and then it still retains an initial rest position .",

    "this is a two phase picture and applying a steady state approximation for the moving domain . before closing , let us make several remarks on the derived exponents .",

    "@xcite are in good agreement with our prediction , further careful checks are awaited on it .",
    "( ii ) as stated in appendix i , the steady state approximation is by construction marginally valid to capture the salient features of the driven translocation , but there is some room to improve the theory by incorporating a slight deviation from the approximation .",
    "( iii ) the presence of several different regimes and the finite - size effects makes the accurate determination of the exponents very difficult ( see also the remark ( i ) , ( ii ) above ) .",
    "we expect , however , that it would be possible to capture a global trend in the exponents by carefully analyzing numerical / experimental data obtained in widely different conditions .",
    "( iv ) aside from exponents , the proposed physical picture is generic , and we believe that our formalism constitutes a minimal model , or a prototype in the problem . from our point of view",
    ", it is more important to comprehend the underlying physics ( even qualitatively ) , and seek for possible improvements of theory to describe the phenomena more adequately ( see , for example , a recent attempt by rowghanian and grosberg  @xcite ) .",
    "( v ) one of the interesting predictions concerns the beta exponent ; it is not necessarily unity in contrast to claims in most other works .",
    "we expect that such a trend ( even qualitatively ) could be detected by careful experiments ; its reliable trend should serve as a stringent test for any theory of the driven translocation .",
    "in summary , we proposed dynamical scaling scenario applicable to the broad range of situations met in the study of polymer driven translocation .",
    "the paper was devoted to the detailed account of tension - propagation mechanism proposed in  @xcite and its extension to cover the wider parameter space through the distinct nonequilibrium conformations . also shown",
    "are the finite size effect , various associated crossovers and their rounding off .",
    "we believe that these elements operate as a guide for further studies towards comprehensive understanding of the driven translocation .",
    "last of all , we expect that the emergent physical picture may be relevant to many other polymeric systems driven by local and strong stimuli .",
    "best examples would be found in the micro - manipulation experiments as well as the biopolymer functions in cells .      since @xmath34-th segment at the front",
    "have just taken part in the moving domain and the velocity profile would be smooth even around the front , there might be substantial velocity gradient there .",
    "if so , its magnitude can be estimated as @xmath130 , whose @xmath48 is the size of the largest blob at the front ( eq .  ( [ rear_blob ] ) ) and can be regarded as the boundary layer . comparing the shear rate with the corresponding longest relaxation time @xmath131 , we find @xmath132 using eqs .",
    "( [ rear_blob ] ) .",
    "thus the concerned shear rate is marginal and one can apply the steady state approximation .    as another possibility",
