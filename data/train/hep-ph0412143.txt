    "the inflationary paradigm  @xcite offers simple answers to the shortcomings of the standard hot big bang model .",
    "in addition , simple inflationary models offer successful candidates for the initial density fluctuations leading to the observed structure formation .",
    "one crucial question though is to answer how generic is the onset of inflation  @xcite and to find consistent and natural models of inflation from the point of view of particle physics .",
    "one can argue that the initial conditions which favor successful inflationary models are the likely outcome of the quantum era before inflation  @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult however to find natural ways to guarantee the flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "the early history of the universe at energies below the planck scale is described by an effective n=1 supergravity theory .",
    "since inflation should have taken place at an energy scale @xmath0 gev , this implies that inflationary models should be constructed in the framework of supergravity . here",
    "is where the problem arises : it is difficult to implement slow - roll inflation within supergravity .",
    "the positive false vacuum of the inflaton field breaks spontaneously global supersymmetry , which gets restored after the end of inflation ( when @xmath1 disappears ) . in supergravity theories ,",
    "the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to all fields by gravity , and thus any scalar field , which could play the rle of the inflaton , gets an effective mass @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for the expansion rate during inflation , and @xmath4 denotes the reduced planck mass .",
    "this problem , known as the problem of `` hubble - induced mass '' , originates from f - term interactions and thus it is resolved if we consider the vacuum energy as being dominated by non - zero d - terms of some superfields  @xcite .",
    "this result led to a dramatic interest in d - term inflation , since in addition this model can easily be implemented in string theory .",
    "however , later on d - term inflation in its turn was though to be plagued with problems .    in d - term inflation ,",
    "the inflationary era ends when a u(1 ) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by a vacuum expectation value of some scalar field , leading to the formation of gauge cosmic strings . as it was explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , cosmic strings are generically expected to be formed at the end of a hybrid inflation phase , in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories . it was claimed  @xcite that the cosmic strings contribution to the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies is constant and dominant ( @xmath5 ) . from the observational point of view",
    "however , strong constraints  @xcite are placed on the allowed cosmic strings contribution to the cmb : it can not exceed @xmath6 .",
    "thus , standard d - term inflation was thought to be inconsistent with cosmology . to rescue d - term inflation there",
    "have been proposed different mechanisms which either consider more complicated models , or they require additional ingredients so that cosmic strings are not produced at the end of hybrid inflation .",
    "for example  @xcite , one can add a nonrenormalisable term in the potential , or add an additional discrete symmetry , or consider gut models based on non - simple groups .",
    "more recently , a new pair of charged superfields has been introduced in d - term inflation so that cosmic strings formation is avoided  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our study is to show that standard d - term inflation leading to the production of cosmic strings is still compatible with cosmological data , and in particular cmb , without invoking any new physical mechanisms .",
    "we find that in d - term inflation the cosmic strings contribution to the cmb data depends on the free parameters , as for f - term inflation  @xcite .",
    "the maximum allowed cosmic strings contribution to the cmb measurements places upper limits on the inflationary scale ( which is also the cosmic string energy scale ) , or equivalently on the coupling of the superpotential .",
    "we first review the results for f - term hybrid inflation , in which case the supersymmetric renormalisable superpotential reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 are three chiral superfields , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are two constants .",
    "the cosmic strings contribution to the cmb is a function of the coupling @xmath9 , or equivalently of the mass scale @xmath10 .",
    "it can be consistent with the most recent measurements , which require that it is at most equal to @xmath11  @xcite , provided  @xcite @xmath12 the above limit was obtained in the context of so(10 ) gauge group .",
    "upper limits of the same order of magnitude are found for other gauge groups  @xcite .",
    "this result implies that f - term inflation leading to the production of cosmic strings of the gut scale can be compatible with measurements , provided the coupling is sufficiently small .",
    "thus , hybrid supersymmetric inflation losses some of its appeal since it is required some amount of fine tuning of its free parameter , @xmath9 should be of the order of @xmath13 or smaller .",
    "this constraint on @xmath9 is in agreement with the one given in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is also subject to the gravitino constraint which imposes an upper limit to the reheating temperature , to avoid gravitino overproduction . within supersymmetric guts , and assuming a see - saw mechanism to give rise to massive neutrinos , the inflaton field will decay during reheating into pairs of right - handed neutrinos . using the constraints on the see - saw mechanism it is possible  @xcite to convert the constraint on the reheating temperature to a constraint on the coupling parameter @xmath9 , namely @xmath14 , which is clearly a weaker constraint .",
    "the superpotential coupling @xmath9 is allowed to get higher values , namely it can approach the upper limit permitted by the gravitino constraint , if one employs the curvaton mechanism  @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism can be easily accommodated within supersymmetric theories , where one expects to have a number of scalar fields . for fixed @xmath9 ,",
    "the cosmic strings contribution decreases rapidly as the initial value of the curvaton field , @xmath15 , decreases .",
    "thus , the wmap measurements lead to an upper limit on @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 gev  @xcite .",
    "this limit holds for @xmath9 in the range @xmath17 $ ] ; for lower values of @xmath9 , the cosmic strings contribution is always suppressed and thus lower than the wmap limit .",
    "the above results hold also if one includes supergravity corrections .",
    "this is expected since the value of the inflaton field is several orders of magnitude below the planck scale .",
    "d - term inflation is derived from the superpotential @xmath18 where @xmath19 are three chiral superfields and @xmath20 is the superpotential coupling . d - term inflation requires the existence of a nonzero fayet - illiopoulos term @xmath21 , permitted only if an extra u(1 ) symmetry beyond the gut framework , is introduced . in the context of supersymmetry",

    "the quadrupole anisotropy is the sum of the inflaton field ( scalar and tensor parts ) and cosmic strings contributions and we normalise it to the cobe data .",
    "we compute the mass scale of the symmetry breaking , given by @xmath26 , and we find that it increases with @xmath20 .",
    "we then calculate the cosmic strings contribution to the temperature anisotropies .",
    "we find that within supersymmetry d - term inflation is consistent with cmb data provided the superpotential coupling @xmath20 is quite small , namely @xmath27 .    however , the dependence of @xmath28 ( the index q denotes the scale corresponding to the quadrupole anisotropy ) on the superpotential coupling @xmath20 results to values of the inflaton field @xmath29 above the planck mass .",
    "this implies that the correct analysis has to be done in the framework of supergravity . for small values of the gauge coupling @xmath24 ,",
    "the study in the context of supergravity becomes just the analysis within supersymmetry .",
    "some previous studies  @xcite found in the literature kept only the first term of the radiative corrections .",
    "we find that it is necessary to perform the analysis using the _ full _ effective potential , which we calculated for minimal supergravity .",

    "this implies that contrary to what is often assumed , the simplest d - term inflation is still an open possibility and one does not need to consider more complicated models .",

    "the constraint induced by cmb measurements is expressed as a single constraint on the fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath21 , namely @xmath56 .    as a next step",
    "we examine whether there is a mechanism to allow more natural values of the couplings . assuming the existence of a scalar field , that is subdominant during inflation as well as at the beginning of the radiation dominated era , such a field ( the curvaton ) gives an additional contribution to the temperature anisotropies , which we calculate below for the case of d - term inflation .",
