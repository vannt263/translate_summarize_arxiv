    "hyperbolic metamaterials ( hmms ) , materials which have a negative dielectric constant in at least one direction , are attracting attention due to their interesting physics and myriad applications .",
    "they can be manufactured relatively simply from alternating layers of metal and dielectric , or by embedding metal rods in a dielectric background  @xcite .",
    "hmms have recently been shown to have unique properties , described by effective medium theory  @xcite , including a broadband infinite density of states  @xcite , arbitrarily large values of the wavevector  @xcite , and negative refraction  @xcite . this has led to many proposed applications , from imaging  @xcite , sensing  @xcite , and wave guiding  @xcite to information processing  @xcite .",
    "the most common hmms considered are uniaxial materials for which @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the principal dielectric constants .",
    "this leads to a hyperboloid isofrequency surface ( refractive index surface ) for the extraordinary ray .",
    "the change in topology from an ellipsoid to a hyperboloid is responsible for many of the important properties of these materials  @xcite . the general case , however , is a biaxial hmm , where @xmath4 .",
    "such a material could be realized as layers of metal and dielectric , where the dielectric material has uniaxial isotropy in the plane , or as rods of metal embedded in a dielectric with different rod spacings in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions  @xcite .",
    "the isofrequency surface for the extraordinary ray is then an asymmetric hyperboloid  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the full two - sheeted isofrequency surface of a hmm , which describes the propagation of both the ordinary and the extraordinary rays with orthogonal polarizations , and show that it contains conical singularities .",
    "these singularities are degenerate points where the two sheets intersect at a point in @xmath7-space .",
    "similar conical singularities occur in conventional biaxial materials , i.e. , @xmath8  @xcite , and lead to the phenomenon of conical refraction , in which a beam of light is refracted into two concentric hollow cones  @xcite .",
    "we describe these intersections in the case of a hmm , and derive a geometrical optics description of refraction for rays with wavevector close to the degeneracy , including establishing the polarization and the poynting vector , or energy flow .",
    "this predicts refraction into two intersecting rather than concentric cones , an effect topologically distinct from that in a conventional biaxial crystal and completely lacking from a uniaxial hmm .",
    "we then extend this theory to develop a paraxial wave optics description of the propagation of light through these materials .",
    "this allows us to calculate the diffraction patterns formed from arbitrary beams incident on a biaxial hmm close to the optic axis .",
    "we find these patterns to be qualitatively different from those obtained in positive index materials , in particular lacking circular symmetry .",
    "these conical singularities are , in some respects , similar to the dirac points  @xcite that are of growing importance in solid - state physics .",
    "these points , where bands cross linearly at a particular frequency and wavevector , are best known in graphene  @xcite .",
    "graphene has attracted huge theoretical and applied interest  @xcite , with many new features attributable to the linear dispersion near a dirac point , which means that the low - energy excitations are massless chiral dirac fermions  @xcite .",
    "they thus provide a model of quantum electrodynamics with the limiting speed given by the fermi velocity rather than the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "they also lead to effects such as the anomalous integer quantum hall effect  @xcite , and mean that electrons are immune to localization , propagating over large distances without scattering  @xcite .",
    "tilted dirac cones , which are not circularly symmetric around the degenerate wavevector , are similar to the skewed - cone intersections reported here , and have previously been predicted in mechanically deformed graphene  @xcite .",
    "dirac points in optical systems have been found in photonic crystals , as a result of the same lattice symmetry  @xcite , or in materials with a frequency dependent permittivity , which may pass through zero at a particular frequency leading to a degeneracy  @xcite .    in these cases , however , a degeneracy occurs at a particular frequency , due to fine tuning the frequency to match the sublattice periodicity , or to match a zero of the frequency dependent dielectric constant . at other nearby frequencies",
    "there is generally no singularity .",
    "in contrast , biaxial materials have conical singularities in the isofrequency surface in @xmath7-space , which is directly comparable to a fermi surface .",
    "the presence of these singularities depends on the symmetry of orthogonal polarizations in a crystal , and does not rely on fine tuning of any parameter .",
    "in particular , we show that they occur within effective medium theory , and argue that their presence is required on topological grounds . since this implies that they occur over a finite range of frequencies they correspond to line , rather than point , degeneracies in the dispersion relation ( which describes a three dimensional surface in the four dimensional space of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",

    "these parameters control the diffraction patterns and have the following interpretations : @xmath121 is a propagation constant , @xmath122 is proportional to the angle of the cone opening , and @xmath123 and @xmath120 control the fine - structure of the diffraction pattern leading to circular asymmetry .     and @xmath124 .",

    "the beam waist @xmath126 is taken as the unit length scale .",
    "the resulting intensity profile is plotted in the focal image plane , @xmath127 , where the resulting ring structure is sharpest .",
    "this position corresponds to the image of the input beam waist in an isotropic crystal of index @xmath128 , and the pattern here can be imaged with a lens if it occurs inside or before the crystal  @xcite . as @xmath129 and @xmath120 all",
    "appear multiplied by @xmath110 for propagation inside the crystal , the length of the crystal is only important relative to the overall scale of these parameters , e.g. a short , strongly diffracting crystal will have the same effect as a long , weakly diffracting one .",
    "the parameter @xmath130 is chosen to give a ring radius @xmath131 to ensure well developed rings while the other parameters are @xmath132 .",
    "this choice allows us to show the asymmetry of the beam on the same scale as the overall conical refraction .    like the positive @xmath11 case , the diffraction pattern consists of two rings .",
    "in contrast to that case , however , the diffraction pattern is not circularly symmetrical .",
    "the rings are broadened in the @xmath6 direction but remain tight in the z direction .",
    "this is in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] which shows the cones moving apart in the @xmath6 direction with increasing @xmath116 .",
    "the diffraction pattern is bounded approximately on the inside and the outside by the arcs of two intersecting circles , also in agreement with the ray diagram .",
    "in addition there is a dark ring .",
    "this is purely an effect of diffraction and is not predicted by geometrical optics  @xcite .",
    "a similar dark ring , known as the pogendorff ring , also appears in the conventional positive @xmath11 case .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a key feature of our results is the existence of linear intersections in the isofrequency surface in hmms . these resemble the dirac points that are of great interest in both condensed - matter physics and optics .",
    "it is therefore important to consider the relation between these phenomena carefully .",
    "the dispersion surfaces describing the propagation of light in a biaxial material can be related to a bandstructure in two ways .",
    "the most straightforward is to consider the full dispersion relation @xmath133 of light , which is a surface in the four - dimensional space of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and compare it with the corresponding dispersion relation for electrons in a periodic lattice . in this case , the isofrequency surfaces described here are directly equivalent to a constant energy surface like the fermi surface , and not directly to the dispersion relation as usually plotted . both are , of course , cross - sections of the full dispersion relation in the four - dimensional space of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but in different directions .    for electrons there are two spin states related by time reversal , so that if time reversal symmetry is present @xmath134 .",
    "if there is spatial inversion symmetry then we furthermore have @xmath135 .",
    "hence if these two symmetries are present there is only one , doubly degenerate , sheet to the fermi surface .",
    "this is a case of kramer s degeneracy .",
    "if one of these symmetries is broken then the spin up and spin down electrons can have different fermi surfaces which may have conical intersections analogous to those described here , with the most common example being ferromagnetism  @xcite .    for photons",
    "there are also two states , corresponding to the two polarizations , but these are related not by time - reversal symmetry , but by electro - magnetic duality .",
    "this symmetry is present if the electric and magnetic fields can be interchanged . in most materials",
    "it is broken , because @xmath136 , and this allows full frequency gaps to open , for example in a photonic crystal  @xcite . in terms of the isofrequency surfaces the ( usual )",
    "breaking of this symmetry lifts the polarization degeneracy for most directions , leaving only the isolated point singularities described here .",
    "there is , however , a less immediate but stronger connection between conical singularities and dirac points , based on the well - known equivalence between the schrodinger equation in @xmath137 and the paraxial helmholtz equation . to demonstrate this connection in the present case",
    ", we construct the paraxial helmholtz equation describing conical diffraction in a biaxial hmm .",
    "we begin by writing the electric field as a plane wave times a slowly varying envelope function @xmath138 where @xmath139 varies slowly with @xmath5 . the diffracted field given by eq .",
    "can be expressed as the two - dimensional transverse input field evolving in the @xmath5-direction as @xmath140 where for conical diffraction in a hmm we find that the hamiltonian is @xmath141 for @xmath142 , and is the free hamiltonian @xmath143 for @xmath144 . here",
    "@xmath145 is a vector of pauli matrices in a cartesian basis and @xmath146 is formally represented by @xmath147 .",
    "the envelope function , thus , obeys the paraxial helmholtz equation , which takes the form @xmath148 since this is equivalent to the schrdinger equation  @xcite , the propagation with @xmath5 of the two dimensional transverse beam is equivalent to the evolution with time of the wavefunction for a spin-@xmath149 particle .",
    "the birefringence of a biaxial material appears as a spin - orbit coupling , whose explicit form , close to the optic axis for a hmm , can be seen in eq . .",
    "this form , with different definitions of the constants , also applies to a conventional biaxial material , but in that case the anisotropic terms proportional to @xmath123 and @xmath120 are negligible and can be dropped  @xcite .    since light ( of a fixed frequency ) propagates in space according to eq .",
    ", with @xmath5 playing the role of time , the propagation constant @xmath150 can be interpreted as the energy .",
    "the isofrequency surfaces can thus be seen as a dispersion relation , giving the propagation constant as a function of the two transverse momenta @xmath151 .",
    "the point intersections in the isofrequency surfaces then correspond to dirac points for two - dimensional electrons ; specifically , the point intersections discussed here are the dirac points of the hamiltonian , eq . .",
    "dirac points in two dimensional materials have been of interest for their role in topological insulators and topologically protected edge states   @xcite . in a hexagonal lattice such as graphene ,",
    "subject to time reversal symmetry and spatial inversion symmetry , the electronic band stucture must contain dirac points .",
    "these degeneracies can be lifted by breaking spatial inversion symmetry , leading to a trivial insulator , or by breaking time reversal symmetry , leading to a topological insulator   @xcite .",
    "hence , work on topological effects in photonic systems has focused on dirac points , primarily in the full frequency dispersion @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "more recently however attention has shifted to the analogous dirac , or conical , intersections in the paraxial propagation constant surface  @xcite .",
    "understanding the effects of different symmetries on these two dispersion surfaces could therefore help progress towards topologically protected photonic systems .",
    "these results illustrate the unique singularities found in hyperbolic metamaterials when all three indices are allowed to vary independently . by examining the full dispersion surface of a general , biaxial , hyperbolic metamaterial , we have identified conical singularities at which the refraction direction is not defined . we have found the approximate dispersion surface and the refracted poynting vector for a ray traveling close to the axis of these singularities .",
    "we have shown that this leads to a new form of refraction which does not appear in the usual uniaxial hmms and is topologically and quantitatively different from the phenomenon of conical refraction which occurs in ordinary biaxial materials .",
    "these propagating solutions remain when a small imaginary component is included , leading to a small amount of absorption , with additional mostly evanescent singular solutions also appearing .",
    "we have also calculated the diffraction pattern for a beam traveling through such a material .",
    "we have found that the diffracted beam is generally not circularly symmetric and that , similar to the positive @xmath11 case , a dark ring appears where ray optics predicts the largest intensity .",
