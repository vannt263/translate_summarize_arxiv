    "the nature of the progenitors of subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars is not well understood .",
    "one theoretical formation method is through a common - envelope ( ce ) phase of evolution with an orbital companion @xcite .",
    "as the progenitor star ascends the first red giant branch , interaction with a companion via a ce may cause it to lose large amounts of mass .",
    "when the progenitor star finally ignites core helium burning on the horizontal branch , it has a small radius , a high effective temperature , and a low - mass hydrogen envelope that can not sustain shell burning : it is a sdb star .",
    "@xcite suggests that a substellar companion ( a brown dwarf or planet ) may be massive enough to survive this ce phase without merging with the host star .",
    "this implies that some sdbs may be created via the evolution of single stars with large planetary companions .",
    "in addition to their importance as tracers of the many paths of stellar evolution , sdb stars have broader importance in that they may be the dominant source of the uv - excess seen in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "hd 149382 is the brightest known sdb star , and thus provides an excellent opportunity to better understand the progenitors of sdb stars .",
    "it is an sdob star with atmospheric parameters @xmath2  k , @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter g09 ) , and a pattern of photospheric abundances altered by diffusion processes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who found @xmath4  k , @xmath5 ) .",
    "g09 claim to have detected a substellar companion to hd 149382 with a mass of @xmath6 using 16 radial velocity ( rv ) measurements collected from four different telescopes over a span of four years .",
    "g09 claim this is significant because it suggests that the progenitors of sdb stars can be stripped of their hydrogen envelopes by substellar companions during the ce phase , strongly supporting @xcite .",
    "this is the first claim of a close substellar companion to an sdb star able to affect the evolution of its host . for brevity we will use the word `` planet '' to refer to a substellar companion of hd 149382 , whether a true planet or a brown dwarf .",
    "@xcite reported a non - detection of the claimed planet from their own rv measurements of hd 149382 using the hermes spectrograph @xcite .",
    "their upper limit on the rv variability of hd 149382 was @xmath7 , nearly three times lower than the amplitude reported by g09 .",
    "since a planet with the reported short orbital period would have important implications , we independently sought verification of its existence , as we describe here .",
    "we observed hd 149382 on 10 nights between april 10 - 27 , 2010 using the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ; * ? ? ? * ) in its @xmath8 configuration , at the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a 9.2 m telescope stationed at the mcdonald observatory near fort davis , texas .",
    "we exploited the queue scheduling of this telescope @xcite to efficiently make our 10 observations and acquire good phase coverage of the orbit .",
    "typical single - exposure signal - to - noise ratios at blaze peak near 5500   were 100 per 4-pixel resolution element .",
    "the use of a single , fiber - fed spectrograph should reduce the potentially significant systematic velocity errors that g09 may have incurred combining measurements made from four different telescopes .",
    "our observing procedure was to obtain two exposures of the star through the @xmath9 fiber followed immediately by two exposures with the iodine absorption cell inserted in the beam .",
    "the cell served to measure night - to - night instrumental offsets due to imperfect repeatability of the instrument configuration .",
    "we also obtained bracketing thorium - argon ( thar ) lamp exposures through the calibration fiber , and the standard thar exposures and flat lamp exposures through the iodine cell at the beginning or end of each night . on the first night",
    ", we obtained only one stellar exposure of each type , and on the final night we obtained three .",
    "the spectra were reduced using ` reduce ` , an advanced image reduction package designed to reduce 2-dimensional , raw echelle spectra into 1-dimensional , wavelength - calibrated spectra @xcite .",
    "the reduction was modified slightly to accommodate fiber - fed spectra , rather than slit spectra .",
    "each observation contains information on two charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) , a `` blue '' ccd and a `` red '' ccd ; we limited our analysis to the blue ccd , where we expect most velocity information to be located .",
    "we extracted 47 orders of 1-dimensional spectra from the blue ccd .    when determining velocities , we stacked all stellar exposures from the same night into a single spectrum .",
    "the time between stellar exposures on the same night is always less than 31 minutes ; finding rv from a stacked spectrum for each night should not change our results , since any change in the rv of the star will be small over the `` smoothing interval '' of our exposures . since we combined pure stellar exposures with stellar - plus - iodine - cell exposures , we were careful to analyze only those orders that contain no iodine lines .",
    "in addition to the putative substellar companion , hd 149382 features a known visual , stellar companion . @xcite detected this visual companion using adaptive optics .",
    "the visual companion is about @xmath10 away ( corresponding to 75 au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the hrs fiber diameter is @xmath9 , so we likely collected light from both stars .",
    "we therefore took care in our velocity analysis to select only lines expected from the primary .",
    "@xcite detected an infrared excess in hd 149382 , probably due to this visual companion , but @xcite detect no spectral features from the companion in the optical .",
    "since we also observed in the optical , and since any orbital motion between the stars must be too slow to be detectable over a 17 day span , we do not expect significant rv errors due to the companion spectrum .",
    "to aid in selecting absorption lines that are unequivocally from the primary star , and not from the faint companion , we generated a synthetic spectrum from a castelli & kurucz model @xcite with the approximate parameters of hd 149382 , as reported by g09 .",
    "we started from a solar - abundance kurucz atmosphere model in lte with @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we selected a line list from the vienna atomic line database ( vald ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spanning the wavelength range @xmath13 , and corresponding to the model selected .",
    "we used the ` synth3 ` code @xcite to generate a stellar spectrum , adopting abundances for elements derived by @xcite , and solar abundances of @xcite for remaining elements .",
    "the resulting spectrum was broadened with a rotational profile of ( @xmath14 ) , and convolved with a gaussian profile to match the @xmath15 hrs observation .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is not an exact match to the observed spectrum of hd 149382 , as several lines are present in the model but not the data ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we note though , that such an exact match is not required for our purpose .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is of sufficient fidelity to unambiguously identify lines that belong to the primary star , and we chose these lines ( i.e. present in the model _ and _ the data ) to measure the rvs .    we visually selected 15 regions containing moderately deep and narrow metal absorption features .",
    "each of these 15 pixel groups contains one or more lines at wavelengths predicted from the model .",

    "we checked our ability to determine precise wavelength solutions on different nights by comparing the night - to - night shift in the wavelength solution to the shifts we measured in the iodine region of the stellar spectra .",
    "since the iodine exposures were made through the science fiber and have extremely high doppler content , they provide a highly sensitive measurement of any instrumental drift affecting stellar velocity measurements .",
    "we compared the shifts measured in 192 63-pixel sections of the iodine region ( through a cross - correlation analysis in pixel space ) to the shifts we measured in the same sections using the nearest adjacent thar exposures ( made through the calibration fiber ) . on each night , the median shift measured from all 192 sections differs by @xmath16 pixel between the thar exposures and the iodine region of the stellar spectra , indicating that the thar exposures track the instrumental shifts of the basement - mounted , temperature - controlled hrs as observed through the science fiber to better than @xmath17 .",
    "the stability of the wavelength solution ( i.e. , its night - to - night precision ) is not a limiting factor in our rv precision .    to determine a rv for each night",
    "s average spectrum , we rebinned our model spectrum into the wavelengths of each pixel group , using the wavelength solution determined from the adjacent thar exposures .",
    "we then calculated the peak in the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) in pixel space between our model and our observation , and used the dispersion of the wavelength solution to calculate a velocity shift .",
    "the primary source of uncertainty in our rv measurements is the uncertainty in the location of the ccf peak due to the finite signal - to - noise ratio of the data .",
    "each of the 15 pixel groups yielded its own set of rv measurements .",
    "we subtracted the barycentric motion of the telescope using routines provided by the california planet survey , which are proven below @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . over the timespan of our data ,",
    "the change in barycentric correction amounts to almost @xmath19 . probably because of line blends ,",
    "the ccfs for the different regions yield rvs that do not share a common apparent systemic velocity , although they indepently detect the barycentric motion .",
    "since we are primarily concerned with the acceleration of the star in its putative orbit rather than the systemic velocity of the star , we subtracted the mean rv of each pixel group from its time series .",

    "we have no reason to suspect the existence of planets at other periods , and our experiment was designed only to confirm or disconfirm this particular claim .",
    "nonetheless , we have thoroughly searched our data for any periodicity to determine the parameter space for planets that is excluded by our data .",
    "we restrict our search to periods between 0.228 days , limited both by a semimajor axis @xmath34 stellar radius as well as the longest period easily detectable with our data span .",
    "we further restrict our search to circular orbits .",
    "the observational cadence of the het creates `` blind spots '' in our coverage near the harmonics of 1 sidereal day .",
    "we have excluded these regions from the following analysis ( we define such a `` blind spot '' as any period for which we have no data points for a stretch of phase larger than 144 degrees , or 0.4 cycles , and for some higher harmonics where the data cluster tightly at two phases 180 degrees apart ) .",
    "we determined the semi - amplitudes of the best fit sinusoids for a well - sampled set of periods between 0.228 days .",
    "the largest semi - amplitudes we find are near @xmath35 , which we find at a variety of periods across our search space .",
    "if we adopt the upper limit of the range of masses of hd 149382 reported by g09 of @xmath36 , then we can translate these semi - amplitudes into upper limits on the minimum companion masses ( @xmath37 ) at each trial period .",
    "we find no best - fit companions with @xmath37 in excess of @xmath38 , which makes the existence of any close - in giant planet with @xmath1 highly unlikely .",
    "figure  [ fig : periodogram ] illustrates our upper limits and blind spots . in principle",
    ", a more massive companion could exist in a face - on orbit , or in one of our period blind spots ( or perhaps in a highly eccentric orbit ) , but this remaining parameter space is extremely narrow .",
    "our results agree with those of @xcite , who also find no massive planets out to @xmath39 days through an analysis of four lines , although our constraints on the rv variability of hd 149382 are over four times more stringent .",
    "there are several claims of substellar companions in orbit around hot subdwarf stars , summarized in @xcite . with the exception of hd 149382 and sdss j08205 + 0008 ( discussed below ) ,",
    "these claims are all based on the interpretation of residuals in an @xmath40 diagram , in which observed ( `` @xmath41 '' ) moments of eclipse or pulsation maximum are compared with a calculated ( `` @xmath42 '' ) ephemeris .",
    "a quasi - sinusoidal pattern of residuals is interpreted in terms of a light - time effect across the orbit of the subdwarf . for the eclipsing systems , the inferred `` planet '' is circumbinary ; for the case of pulsations ( v391 peg : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sdb star is otherwise thought to be single .",
    "except for hd 149382 and cs 1246 ( see below ) , all of the claimed orbital periods for substellar companions to sdb stars are long , in the range of 3 to 16 years .",
    "nearly always , a parabolic term is fitted to the @xmath40 residuals along with the orbital sinusoid .",
    "the parabola represents either an evolving pulsation period or an evolving orbital period of the eclipsing binary , as angular momentum is transferred by tides from the orbit to the binary companion , which undergoes `` magnetic braking '' .",
    "the relatively short observational timespans , with the additional issue of correlations between model parameters describing the parabolic term and the light - time orbit , conspire to make these claims of substellar companions quite fragile  new observations tend to destroy the previous solution .",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for examples of broken timing orbits in the case of eclipsing binaries with white dwarf primaries . )",
    "quasi - cyclical variation in @xmath40 residuals for binaries may have causes other than orbital motion involving a third body , such as the `` applegate mechanism '' @xcite , in which mass quadrupole variations induced by stellar activity cycles alter the effective keplerian mass of the binary .",
    "the only timing - based ( @xmath40 ) detection of a companion to an sdb star that has been confirmed by an rv study is that of cs 1246 @xcite . here",
    "the orbital period is 14.1 days , but the minimum mass of the companion is @xmath43 , above the substellar limit .    some of the claimed substellar companions in long - period orbits may be corroborated with continuing observations , and others will surely be found .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that these large orbits tell us anything directly about the formation process of the sdb stars themselves .",
    "( @xcite does discuss the possibility that large orbits may be indicators for the previous existence of inner planets , destroyed in a ce process . )",
    "it is also important to bear in mind that only a lower limit @xmath44 to the companion mass @xmath45 is found from these timing solutions .",
    "short - period orbits of substellar companions around sdb stars are of more interest for elucidating the prior history of the sdb star .",
    "in addition to the idea that a planet may assist in removing the hydrogen envelope from the proto - sdb stars @xcite , there is the possibility that `` second - generation '' planets may form in the debris left from the merger of two helium white dwarfs ( the  helium planet  scenario of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note however , that since a merger between a helium white dwarf and a low - mass hydrogen - burning star may also create an sdb star @xcite , a resulting second - generation planet need not be of exotic composition .",
    "the formation of sdb stars through envelope stripping by planets is an intriguing hypothesis , but in light of the fact that the claimed planet hd 149382 @xmath46 does not exist , it currently has little observational support . to date the only such companion known is that in the eclipsing sdb+brown dwarf system sdss j08205 + 0008 , found by @xcite . the orbital period is @xmath47 , and the estimated mass for the strongly irradiated companion , for reasonable estimates of the mass of the sdb star , is in the range @xmath48 , slightly below the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "this pushes the lower mass limit for companions in short - period sdb systems to somewhat lower masses than before ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion of hw vir systems ) , but hardly into the planetary realm .",
    "given the potential importance of significantly substellar companions to the understanding of the extremes of binary star evolutionary channels as well as the formation of second - generation planets , searches for such companions to sdb stars in short - period orbits should continue .",
    "meanwhile , the putative planet orbiting hd 149382 has already been put to use by @xcite in revising the `` @xmath49 formalism '' for ce binary evolution .",
    "those authors make the ce efficiency parameter @xmath49 a strongly decreasing function of mass ratio .",
    "this conclusion relies strongly on the large value of @xmath50 inferred for the putative hd 149382 `` planetary '' system .",
    "@xcite recognized hd 149382 as an outlier , and presented parametrized forms for @xmath49 derived with and without including it in the sample of studied systems . with our demonstration that this system does not exist ( at least , as specified by g09 )",
    ", the weaker dependence of @xmath49 on mass ratio is favored .",
    "our findings conclusively refute the @xcite claim of a substellar object orbiting the hot subdwarf star hd 149382 .",
    "the orbital solution found by @xcite is strongly inconsistent with our rv measurements .",
    "our best fit results near the putative planet s best period are @xmath51 and @xmath30 , which is consistent with @xmath33 given the uncertainties in our measurements .",
    "we can further confidently rule out planets with @xmath52 in circular orbits with periods @xmath53 days , except for a few special cases arising from the cadence of our observations .",
