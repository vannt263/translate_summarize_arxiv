    "first , we briefly review the approach .",
    "of course , the standard model interaction term for @xmath1 decay or @xmath2 includes the leptonic piece :    @xmath3    the object @xmath4 is now known @xcite-@xcite to be a linear combination of neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath5 : @xmath6    where , in a basis with the charged leptons diagonal , the full lepton mixing matrix is written as : @xmath7 as has been discussed by many authors @xcite-@xcite the results of neutrino oscillation experiments are ( neglecting possible phases to be discussed later ) consistent with the  tribimaximal mixing \" matrix : @xmath8 many different approaches have been used to explain the form of @xmath9 .",
    "natural\",and often investigated one uses the parallel three generation structure of the fundamental fermion families as a starting point .",
    "an underlying discrete symmetry @xmath10 , the permutation group on three objects , is then assumed .",

    "one may note that the tribimaximal matrix , @xmath13 is an example of the transformation which relates the given basis to the irreducible one .",
    "this fact provides our motivation for further investigating the @xmath14 symmetry , even though many other interesting approaches exist .",

    "physically one can assign different masses to the mass eigenstate @xmath26 in the 1-dimensional basis and to the ( doubly degenerate ) eigenstates @xmath25 and @xmath27 in the 2-dimensional basis . at first glance",
    "this sounds ideal since it is well known that the three neutrino masses are grouped into two almost degenerate ones (  solar neutrinos `` ) and one singlet , with different values .",
    "however , since we are demanding that r be taken as the tribimaximal form , the physical identification requires @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be the ' ' solar \" neutrino eigenstates rather than the degenerate ones @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "this had been considered a serious objection to the present approach since often a scenario is pictured in which the mass eigenvalue for @xmath28 is considerably larger than the roughly degenerate masses associated with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a way out was suggested in @xcite where it was noted that , for values of @xmath31 larger than around 0.3 ev , the neutrino spectrum would actually be approximately degenerate .",
    "this may be seen in detail by consulting the chart in table 1 of @xcite wherein the neutrino masses are tabulated as a function of an assumed value of the third neutrino mass , @xmath32 .",
    "actually it is seen that there is also a region around @xmath33 0.04 ev and @xmath34 where an assumed initial degeneracy may be reasonable . to make physical sense out of such a scenario , it was suggested that the neutrino mass matrix be written as , @xmath35 where @xmath36 has the full @xmath14 invariance and has degenerate ( at least approximately ) eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , the smaller @xmath37 is invariant under a particular @xmath38 subgroup of @xmath14 and breaks the degeneracy .",
    "finally , @xmath39 is invariant under a different @xmath38 subgroup of @xmath14 and is assumed to be smaller still .",
    "the strengths are summarized as : @xmath40 this is inspired by the pre - qcd flavor perturbation theory of the strong interaction which works quite well . in that case the initially unknown strong interaction hamiltonian is expanded as @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the dominant @xmath43 flavor invariant piece , @xmath44 is the smaller gell - mann okubo perturbation @xcite which transforms as the eighth component of a flavor octet representation and breaks the symmetry to su(2 ) and @xmath45 , which transforms as a different component of the octet representation and breaks the symmetry further to the hypercharge u(1 ) , is smaller still .",
    "there is a possible immediate objection to the assumption that the neutrino mass eigenvalues be degenerate in the initial s@xmath46 invariant approximation ; after all eq.([complexeigenvalues ] ) shows that there are two different eigenvalues @xmath18 and @xmath47 .",
    "this was overcome by recognizing that these are both complex numbers and that they could both have the same magnitude but different directions .",
    "having the same magnitude guarantees that all three physical masses will be the same .",
    "this introduces a physical phase @xmath0 corresponding to the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath47 .    in the strong interaction case , the initial su(3 )",
    "invariance was found to be reasonably well obeyed .",
    "it is thus natural to ask what predictions may exist in the initial @xmath14 invariant approximation in our neutrino model .",
    "it was found @xcite that the leptonic factor for neutrinoless double beta decay , @xmath48 could be predicted in this limit to be , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the degenerate neutrino mass and @xmath0is the majorana type phase mentioned above .",
    "this led to the inequality @xmath51    the next step in the program is to consider the effect of the perturbation @xmath37 .",
    "many authors @xcite-@xcite have suggested that a @xmath52-@xmath53 symmetry ( ( 23 ) symmetry in the present language ) is associated with tribimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector .",
    "thus it is a natural @xmath38 symmetry choice for @xmath37 .",
    "recently , chen and wolfenstein @xcite applied this type of perturbation to our present model with the additional assumption that the majorana phase @xmath0 takes the value @xmath54 .",
    "this corresponds to cp conservation .",
    "their result for @xmath55 is in agreement with the lower limit in eq.([inequality ] ) . here",
    "we will investigate the first perturbed case without assuming that special value of @xmath0 .    before going on to this",
    "we will present an amusing argument to show that the ( 23 ) perturbation is naturally associated with the tribimaximal form ( modulo the majorana type phase @xmath0 ) rather than a tribimaximal form multiplied by a rotation in the two dimensional degenerate subspace ( which is physically irrelevant at the @xmath14 invariant level ) .",
    "this is based on the fact that degenerate perturbation theory must be employed , which leads to a stability condition .",
    "further we will show that other @xmath38 perturbations are mathematically consistent but do not lead to the desired tribimaximal form .",
    "in the present framework there are three different possible perturbations , each characterized by the @xmath38 subgroup which remains invariant .",
    "let us first consider the favored perturbation which leaves invariant the s@xmath56 subgroup , consisting of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "apart from a piece which may be reabsorbed in eq.([solution ] ) , such a perturbation has the form , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are parameters .",
    "it is convenient to adopt the language of ordinary quantum mechanics perturbation theory .",
    "we should then work in a basis like eq.([complexeigenvalues ] ) where @xmath20 in eq.([solution ] ) is diagonal .",
    "however , because of the double degeneracy between the eigenvectors @xmath25 and @xmath27 in eq.([r ] ) , the matrix @xmath23 is not the unique one which diagonalizes @xmath20 .",
    "we should really use the more general matrix @xmath62 where @xmath63 is given by : @xmath64 in this basis @xmath65 has the form : @xmath66 here , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . note that , before adding a perturbation , the @xmath14 symmetry predicts the lepton mixing matrix to be @xmath62 rather than the desired tribimaximal form , @xmath23 .",
    "in perturbation theory , the first correction to the @xmath69 eigenvector involves the ratio @xmath70 . for degenerate perturbation theory it is of course necessary that the numerator vanishes for those states with @xmath71 .",
    "here we simply require for the ( 13 ) matrix element : @xmath72 this yields in general , @xmath73 .",
    "the solution with @xmath74 is the desired tribimaximal form .",
    "the solution with @xmath75 just changes the signs of the first and third columns .",
    "however , the solutions with @xmath76 and @xmath77 interchange the first and third columns , which does not agree with experiment .",
    "thus , apart from a discrete ambiguity , the tribimaximal form is uniquely chosen when a smooth connection with the ( 23)-type perturbation is required .",
    "of course , the smooth connection corresponds to choosing the correct initial states for the perturbation treatment .",
    "it is easy to see that perturbations which leave the other two @xmath38 subgroups invariant , do not lead to mixing matrices of the desired tribimaximal form .",
    "the perturbation which commutes with @xmath78 is : @xmath79 similarly , the perturbation which commutes with @xmath80 has the form : @xmath81    the stability condition for obtaining the tribimaximal mixing for the @xmath82 pertubation would require the matrix element @xmath83 to vanish ; instead it takes the value @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , the stability condition for the @xmath85 pertubation does not work since the matrix element @xmath86 takes the generally non - zero value @xmath87 .",
    "while we have seen that the stability condition for ( 23 ) invariant perturbations enforces the experimentally plausible tribimaximal mixing , the underlying @xmath14 symmetry should allow characteristic stable mixing matrices to emerge for either the ( 12 ) invariant or ( 13 ) invariant perturbations .",
    "what are their forms ? in the case of a ( 12 ) perturbation , the stability condition associated with degenerate",
    "perturbation theory reads : @xmath88 here the characteristic mixing matrix emerges as @xmath89 for a suitable value of @xmath90 .",
    "the solution is easily seen to have the form : @xmath91 in the case of a ( 13 ) invariant perturbation , the stability condition associated with degenerate perturbation theory reads : @xmath92 here the characteristic stable mixing matrix turns out to be : @xmath93    the situation is summarized in table [ firsttable ] .",
    "mathematically , any of the three perturbations will result in a stable mixing matrix .",
    "however , only the ( 23 ) perturbation gives the experimentally allowed tribimaximal form .",
    "for example ,",
    "we see that the zero value of @xmath94 , in good present agreement with experiment , only holds for the @xmath65 [ ( 23)-type ] perturbation .    .characteristic , stable mixing matrices for each @xmath38 invariant perturbation . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to go further we adopt convenient conventions for the , in general , complex parameters @xmath18 and @xmath1 defined in eq.([solution ] ) .",
    "the goal is to adjust a phase , @xmath0 in order that the zeroth order spectrum has three exactly degenerate neutrinos . as shown in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , we take the 2-vector 3@xmath1 to be real positive . then the 2-vector @xmath18 lies in the third quadrant as : @xmath95 where the physical phase @xmath0 lies in the range : @xmath96 finally @xmath97 is related to @xmath1 by , @xmath98 in the limiting case @xmath99 , @xmath18 takes the real value , @xmath100",
    "for simplicity we will consider the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 in eq.([23pert ] ) to be real rather than complex .",
    "the entire neutrino mass matrix to first order is @xmath101 . since we are working in a basis where the zeroth order piece is diagonalized by the tribimaximal matrix , @xmath23 , we must diagonalize the matrix : @xmath102    diagonalizing the upper left 2 x 2 sub - matrix yields the three , in general , complex eigenvalues : @xmath103 where we introduced the abbreviation , @xmath104 .",
    "the indicated approximations to the exact eigenvalues correspond to working to first order in the parameters t and u. remember that according to our original setup , t and u are supposed to be small compared to @xmath97 and @xmath1 . since fig .",
    "[ triangle ] shows that generally @xmath105 , it is sufficient that @xmath106 and @xmath107 be small compared to @xmath1 .    in this approximation",

    "the neutrino masses , to order @xmath113 , are seen to be : @xmath114 , \\nonumber \\\\ m_2&\\approx & \\frac{3\\beta}{2}csc(\\frac{\\psi}{2})\\left[1 + \\frac{4}{9\\beta } ( t+u)sin^2(\\frac{\\psi}{2 } ) \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ m_3&\\approx & \\frac{3\\beta}{2}csc(\\frac{\\psi}{2})\\left[1- \\frac{6}{9\\beta } ( t - u)sin^2(\\frac{\\psi}{2})\\right ] .",

    "it is known that @xcite @xmath117 also , constraints on cosmological structure formation yield @xcite a rough bound , @xmath118 the two allowed spectrum types are : @xmath119 .",
    "now , from eq.([numasses ] ) we see to leading order : @xmath120    the quantities @xmath121 and @xmath122 may thus be obtained for a type 1 spectrum as : @xmath123 where the central experimental values were used . in the type 2 spectrum case",
    ", we should change @xmath124 in the above to find , @xmath125    thus the , assumed real , @xmath14 violation parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 are now known for each spectrum type .",
    "information about the quantity @xmath1 may in principle be obtained from the perturbed lepton mixing matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ fullmixingmat ] ) : @xmath126    with a usual parameterization @xcite the matrix with zero ( 13 ) element takes the form ,    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is short for @xmath129 for example .",
    "this amounts to the predictions , @xmath130 notice that , when the perturbation is absent , this agrees with the tribimaximal form used here if both @xmath131 and @xmath132 lie in the second quadrant .",
    "the results of a recent study @xcite of neutrino oscillation experiments are : @xmath133 one immediately notices that the prediction , @xmath134=1/2 is unchanged from its tribimaximal value by the perturbation and agrees with the new analysis . on the other hand",
    "the tribimaximal prediction , @xmath135=1/3 is slightly changed from its tribimaximal value and actually lies slightly above the upper experimental error bar .",
    "this is probably not a serious disagreement but it might be instructive to try to fix it using the predicted perturbation in the present model : @xmath136 for either the type 1 or type 2 assumed spectrum , the perturbation is seen to be in the correct direction to lower the value of @xmath137 , as desired .",
    "however , because of the large cancellation between @xmath138 and @xmath122 , this effect is extremely small for a reasonable value of @xmath139 ; even with @xmath1 as small as 0.05 ev , @xmath135 is only lowered to 0.332 .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss the absolute masses of the neutrinos rather than just the differences of their squares .",
    "since the differences are known , let us focus on one of them , say @xmath32 : @xmath140 notice that the first term on the right hand side is , using eq.([alphabeta ] ) , simply the zeroth order degenerate mass , @xmath97 while the second term represents the correction . also note that ( see fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ) the point @xmath141 is not allowed . considering @xmath0 as a parameter ( related to the strength of neutrinoless double beta decay )",
    ", this equation represents a quadratic formula giving @xmath1 in terms of the absolute mass @xmath32 for any assumed @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ pregion ] , adopting the criterion that @xmath142 and @xmath143 be less than 1/5 for perturbative behavior , we display the perturbative region in the @xmath144 plane .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath32 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are seen to have small corrections since they of course depend on @xmath145 rather than @xmath146 .",
    "the characteristic physical novelty of of a theory with majorana type neutrinos is the prediction of a small , but non - zero , rate for the neutrinoless double beta decay of a nucleus : ( a , z ) @xmath147 ( a , z+2 ) + 2@xmath148 .",
    "the appropriate leptonic factor describing the amplitude for this process is ,    @xmath149    substituting in the neutrino masses to order @xmath113 from eq.([numasses ] as well as eq.([phasematrix ] ) yields : @xmath150 e^{2i(\\tau-\\sigma})| . \\label{meetwo}\\ ] ] the needed intermediate quantity @xmath151 $ ] may be easily obtained from eqs.([majphases ] ) by construction of a suitable right triangles to be : @xmath152 \\approx cos \\psi -\\frac{(t+u)sin\\psi}{9\\beta}. \\nonumber\\ ] ]    we then find , correct to first order in @xmath113 , @xmath153 which is just the zeroth order result . the experimental bound on @xmath55 is given @xcite as ,    @xmath154    which is small enough so that there is hope the possibility of a majorana neutrino might be settled in the near future . since the correction to @xmath55 has been seen to be zero in this model we can take over the zeroth order inequality in eq.([inequality ] ) .",
    "this means that the existence of the majorana phase , @xmath0 can alter the amplitude for neutrinoless double beta decay by a factor of three for given ( approximately degenerate ) neutrino masses .",
    "in some ways the problem of  flavor \" in the standard model is reminiscent of that in strong interaction physics before the quark model . at that time",
    "it was realized that , as a precursor to detailed dynamics , group theory might give important clues .",
    "then the strong interactions were postulated to be su(3 ) flavor invariant with a weaker piece having just the the su(2 ) isospin ( times hypercharge ) invariance .",
    "in addition it was known that there was a still weaker isospin breaking ( possibly qed ) which by itself preserved a different su(2 ) invariance ( so - called u - spin ) .    here ,",
    "an analogy for neutrinos of the first two steps was studied in a perturbative framework . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the possibility that the neutrinos are not strictly degnerate at the unperturbed level was contemplated .",
    "however in this paper we have examined a strictly degenerate first stage ( setting to zero the parameters called respectively @xmath155 and @xmath156 in those two papers ) .    at the @xmath14 invariant level",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix is actually arbitrary up to a rotation in a 2-dimensional subspace .",
    "this problem can be settled ( since degenerate perturbation theory is involved ) by specifying the transformation property of the perturbation to be added . although there is widespread agreement that the first perturbation should preserve the @xmath38 subgroup which interchanges the second and third neutrinos , we presented in section ii , for completeness and interest , the mixing matrices for the other two possibilities also .    in sections iii and iv we carried out the perturbation analysis for any choice of a majorana - type phase , @xmath0 which plays an important role in this model .",
    "if @xmath0 is considered fixed there are three parameters in the model ( in @xcite @xmath0 was considered fixed at the value @xmath54 . )",
    "these three parameters can be taken as @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath157 defined above .",
    "the quantities @xmath121 and @xmath122 were found in terms of the neutrino squared mass differences for each choice of neutrino spectrum type , ie normal or inverted hierarchy .",
    "the value of @xmath1 depends on the presently unknown absolute value of any neutrino mass .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath121 and @xmath122 are similar ( though not exactly equal ) but differ in sign .",
    "thus the perturbation corrections which involve ( @xmath138 + @xmath122 ) are very small .",
    "clearly ( see the first of eqs.([deltanus ] ) ) this is due to the small solar neutrino mass difference .",
    "this situation occurs for the correction to the mixing parameter @xmath158 in addition to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the masses of the first two neutrinos . the perturbation dependence on ( @xmath138 -@xmath159 is not suppressed however .",
    "this occurs for the mass , @xmath32 of the third neutrino .",
    "this result was used to make a sketch of the region in the @xmath0-@xmath32 plane for which the perturbation approach given seems numerically reasonable .",
    "the explicit role of the higgs sector , which is believed to be at the heart of the matter , was not discussed in the present paper . however , this as well as some further technical details were discussed in @xcite .",
    "further treatment of this aspect is interesting for future work as is a detailed investigation of the weakest perturbation , the analog of the u - spin preserving perturbation in the strong interaction .",
    "this could be used to further study other consequences @xcite of possibly non - zero @xmath160 .",
