    "the geothermal reservoir of soultz - sous - forts , like most geological systems , contains structures of various size along which flow occurs : three main types of structures were identified : individual fractures , fracture clusters and major faults  @xcite . in order to understand these flow systems and help with managerial decisions ,",
    "large scale numerical models incorporating such heterogeneities have been developed . yet",
    ", when the transport of solutes is involved , the choice of a dispersion law ( possibly scale dependent ) valid at the scale of an individual fracture remains an open issue  @xcite .",
    "+ at this scale , tracer dispersion results from the combined action of the complex velocity field ( varying both in the gap of the fracture and in its plane ) and of mixing by molecular diffusion .",
    "the latter allows the tracers to move from one streamline to another and homogenizes the spatial distribution of the tracers . in the classical approach",
    ", tracer particles are assumed to perform a random walk superimposed over a drift velocity .",
    "the latter is the average of the fluid velocity over an appropriate volume ( the representative elementary volume or rev ) while smaller scale variations induce tracer spreading . at the rev scale ,",
    "the average @xmath8 of the tracer concentration over a section of the medium normal to the mean displacement satisfies the convection - diffusion equation  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient , @xmath6 the mean velocity of the fluid ( parallel to @xmath11 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath10 ( or equivalently of the dispersivity @xmath12 ) is independent of both time and the travelled distance : it is determined by the combined contributions of molecular diffusion and advection .",
    "the relative order of magnitude of these two effects is characterized by the pclet number : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the molecular diffusion coefficient ; @xmath15 is a characteristic length of the medium ( here the mean fracture aperture ) .",
    "+ recent experimental studies of breakthrough curves of solutes in natural fractures  @xcite measured dispersion coefficients increasing linearly with the mean flow @xmath16 ( or with @xmath1 ) . moreover , the value of the dispersivity @xmath17 observed agreed with the predictions of a perturbation analysis  @xcite .",
    "these results suggested that dispersion is controlled ( like in 3d porous media @xcite ) by spreading due to velocity variations associated to the geometry of the void structure .",
    "the latter determines the correlation length of the velocity field , leading to the so called geometrical dispersion regime .",
    "however , flow in fractures is known to be frequently concentrated in long channels of high hydraulic conductance  @xcite .",
    "the velocity remains then correlated over distances which may be too large for establishing a fickian dispersion regime .",
    "these previous experiments were all performed for a fixed path length : however , in order to test the validity of the fickian description one must measure the variation of the width of the mixing front with time @xmath18 and check whether it increases , as expected , as @xmath19 ) . +",
    "another key factor is dispersion resulting from the flow profile in the gap of the fracture : the variation of the velocity between the walls ( where it cancels out ) and the middle of the gap ( where it has a maximal value ) stretches the solute front .",
    "this creates a concentration gradient across the gap which is balanced by transverse molecular diffusion .",
    "the decorrelation of the velocity of the solute is then determined by the characteristic time for the diffusion of solute particles across the gap .",
    "this differs from the geometrical regime in which the decorrelation is determined by the geometrical structure of the fracture.then , the longitudinal dispersion coefficient scales like @xmath20 in this so - called taylor dispersion ( instead of @xmath21 for geometrical dispersion ) .",
    "+ in fractures , both dispersion regimes are expected to coexist ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) : at low pclet numbers ( but large enough to neglect pure molecular diffusion ) , dispersion is controlled by the disordered geometry , while , at higher ones , taylor dispersion becomes the leading dispersion mechanism . yet , the critical pclet number characterizing the transition still has to be determined .",
    "also , the robustness of this model when contact points between the fracture walls are present must be tested . + we discuss in this paper dispersion experiments dealing with these issues and carried out in transparent fractures with various degrees of heterogeneities .",
    "the geometries of the void space and the roughness of the walls of these models are described in sec .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "they range from a random wall roughness with a correlation length of the order of the aperture to a multiscale rough wall geometry similar to that observed in the field  @xcite ; this latter case often leads to a strong flow channelization  @xcite . in the present models a relative shear displacement @xmath4 of complementary matching rough walls",
    "is introduced : high aperture channels oriented normal to the displacement and spanning over the fracture are then created leading to an anisotrope aperture field  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon increases with the magnitude of @xmath4 and becomes noticeable as soon as @xmath5 is of the order of the mean aperture  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the contact area between the fracture walls was also investigated by performing flow experiments in a transparent model fracture with an array of contact points .",

    "+ @xmath22 models @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 : the roughness of the walls of these models has a multiscale self - affine geometry similar to that of many fractured rocks ; the walls of these fractures are complementary with a relative shear displacement either parallel ( @xmath47 ) for model @xmath40 or perpendicular ( @xmath49 ) for models @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the relative shear produces a channelization perpendicular to @xmath4 of the aperture field : as a result , dispersion depends strongly on the relative orientation of @xmath4 and @xmath6 . + for @xmath49 , the global spreading of the mixing front is not dispersive .",
    "the global width of the front parallel to @xmath6 increases instead linearly with time and reflects directly the velocity contrasts between the channels created by the shear .",
    "the large scale structures of the front can be predicted from the aperture field and their size increases with the shear - thinning character of the fluid .",
    "the variation of the local thickness of the front remains instead dispersive , but with a magnitude larger than for taylor dispersion . for model",
    "@xmath40 ( @xmath47 ) , the global spreading of the front is much weaker that in model @xmath41 which has the same characteristics but for which @xmath49 : local spreading is controlled by taylor dispersion at large @xmath1 s and by molecular diffusion at lower ones .",
    "the experiments reported here demonstrate that varying the fluid rheology is a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding hydrodynamic tracer dispersion mechanisms in rough fractures .",
    "+ for models @xmath23 and @xmath31 , both the size of the wall rugosities and the correlation length of the velocity field are small compared to the global size of the fracture : this allows one to reach a geometrical dispersion regime at low @xmath1 values . at higher @xmath142e s ,",
    "other characteristics of the structure of the void space such as the flow profile in the aperture ( model @xmath23 ) and the distribution of the tracer in the pore junctions ( model @xmath31 ) strongly influence dispersion . in these models ,",
    "dispersion may be characterized by a single macroscopic dispersion coefficient : however the knowledge of the microscopic structure of the fracture aperture field ( correlation length , pore size ... ) is necessary to predict its value and dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "+ experiments performed on multiscale fractures ( models @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) reproducing the roughness of natural fractures have demonstrated the strong influence of channelization and of its orientation with respect to the mean flow on the transport of tracer .",
    "an important issue is whether , in these cases , transverse exchange of tracer is large enough so that a diffusive spreading regime might be reached at very large distances .",
    "these results have potentially a strong relevance to the efficiency of the recovery of heat through water circulation in geothermal reservoirs .",
    "there are also other possible applications to the prediction of seismic events from water circulation in the rock layers under stress .",
