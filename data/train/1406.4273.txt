    "the real - time behavior of quantum systems composed of fermions coupled to gauge fields is one of the major challenges of modern theoretical physics .",
    "exactly solvable models , such as the schwinger model of massless quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in @xmath4 space - time dimensions @xcite , can provide important insights into more general phenomena .",
    "the schwinger model shares several key properties with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , charge screening and the axial anomaly . since a long time it is used as an effective model for the description of some characteristic qcd properties  @xcite , and has been recently employed to real - time questions of jet energy loss and photon production in the context of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "while the massless schwinger model is analytically solvable , no exact solution is known for massive fermions @xcite .",
    "the current quark masses of the light quarks are small compared to the qcd scale .",
    "however , they are not massless and the question arises how the results of the schwinger model are connected to the massive case .",
    "recently , also the prospect of constructing quantum simulators for gauge theories using ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices boosted the interest in questions regarding the real - time dynamics of string breaking in @xmath4 dimensional qed with massive fermions  @xcite .",
    "though nonequilibrium real - time problems are not amenable to standard euclidean lattice simulations , there is a large class of time - dependent problems for which the quantum dynamics can be accurately mapped onto a classical - statistical ensemble that can be simulated on a lattice  @xcite .",
    "this has recently been used to simulate real - time lattice qed with wilson fermions in @xmath4 @xcite as well as @xmath5 dimensions @xcite .",
    "no attempt has been made so far to connect these real - time results to the limit of vanishing fermion mass @xmath1 . in @xmath4 dimensions",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath2 has the dimension of mass and the massless limit emerges from the strongly correlated regime of large @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , calculations in this regime serve also as an important benchmark for the simulation method where they have to connect to known exact results .    in this work",
    "we simulate real - time properties of @xmath4 dimensional qed for a wide range of fermion mass values and demonstrate the approach to analytic predictions of the massless limit .",
    "we investigate two scenarios corresponding to opposite charges which are either placed at a fixed distance apart from each other or moving back - to - back along the light cone .",
    "the latter scenario has been employed for effective descriptions of jet energy loss and photon production in the context of heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . following these applications ,",
    "we first consider the applied charges as external sources on the light cone .",
    "since the introduction of external sources violates energy conservation , the question arises whether treating the charges fully dynamically  including the backreactions from the system onto their dynamics  alters the results . for this",
    "we produce two dynamical fermions of charge @xmath6 by applying a suitable short electric field pulse via the schwinger effect and compare this energy conserving prescription to the previous studies .",
    "remarkably , we find that for all considered cases the observed dynamics is well described by the massless limit for a large range of mass values at fixed coupling .",
    "this establishes an important link for applications as well as the computational procedure .",
    "for instance , the link clearly demonstrates the relevance of the multiple string breaking phenomenon , which was found in simulations with massive fermions @xcite , for our understanding of the dynamics of receding fermions close to the light cone .",

    "<S> quantum electrodynamics in @xmath0 space - time dimensions is analytically solvable for massless fermions , while no solution is known for massive fermions . employing the classical - statistical approach </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate the real - time dynamics on a lattice using wilson fermions with mass @xmath1 at gauge coupling @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that quantitative properties of the massless schwinger model are emerging in the limit of large @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate two scenarios corresponding to opposite charges which are either held fixed or moving back - to - back along the light cone , as employed in effective descriptions for jet energy loss and photon production in the context of heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that the dynamics is rather well described by the massless limit for a wide range of mass values at fixed coupling . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our study shows that previous approximate scenarios with external charges on the light cone rather accurately capture the self - consistent dynamics of the energy conserving simulation . </S>"
