    "two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) under perpendicular magnetic fields have revealed at low temperatures a wealth of surprising transport properties @xcite , which are direct manifestations of quantum mechanics at the macroscopic scale .",
    "remarkably , in the same 2deg system one may observe gradually by increasing the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath2 different quantum phenomena @xcite : shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations , followed by integer and then fractional quantum hall effects ( qhe ) .",
    "all these effects capitalize on the quantization of the cyclotron orbital motion resulting from the lorentz force , which gives rise to discrete kinetic energy levels @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 a positive integer , @xmath5 the cyclotron frequency , @xmath6 the electron charge , @xmath7 the effective mass , and @xmath8 planck s constant divided by @xmath9 ) .",
    "the qhe characterized by a spectacularly robust quantization of the hall conductance in integral @xcite or fractional @xcite multiples of @xmath10 differ from the sdh ( diffusive ) regime by the quasi - absence of dissipation in the bulk , as vindicated by the spectacular drop in magnitude of the longitudinal conductance minima .",
    "this transition is usually understood with the onset of a quasi - ballistic transport regime @xcite , associated with the localization of all the bulk states except at the center of a landau level @xcite where a diffusive electronic propagation throughout the system can set in only via percolation .",
    "a semiclassical localization mechanism @xcite resulting from the decoupling of the ( quantized ) cyclotron motion with the guiding center , which leads to a quasi - regular drift of the electronic states along constant energy contours of the smooth disorder potential landscape , has recently been confirmed @xcite by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the integer qhe regime .",
    "percolative spatial structures for the local density of states taking place at the transition between hall plateaus have also been clearly identified in this local probe experiment @xcite .",
    "signatures of percolation in transport properties have been mainly discussed in the literature @xcite at very low temperatures ( typically below @xmath11 k ) , when several quantum mechanical effects ( tunneling , quantum coherence , etc ... ) play a role @xcite and complicate the analysis both theoretically and experimentally . however",
    ", if the localization mechanism for the qhe is classical in nature , we expect these percolative features at high magnetic fields to be also observable at much higher temperatures , in a classical transport regime .    in this paper",
    ", we study the nature of the high magnetic field , high temperature transport regime , combining experimental measurements in the 1 - 50 k range with recent theoretical predictions @xcite . we first identify a crossover magnetic field @xmath0 t above which chaotic classical ( diffusive ) dynamics breaks down , that we correlate to the onset of qhe at low temperature .",
    "this observation points to the common origin of long - range disorder in suppressing the diffusive regime , both in the classical and quantum realms .",
    "for @xmath1 we observe various scaling laws that demonstrate the combined role of phonon scattering and classical percolation in the transport properties .",
    "the 2degs used in our study are delta - doped al@xmath12ga@xmath13as / gaas heterostructures patterned into a hall bar .",
    "the transport measurements were performed with a standard low frequency lock - in technique for temperatures @xmath14 between 1.2 k and 50 k in a variable temperature insert , under magnetic fields up to 11 t. the first ( second ) sample has a mobility @xmath15 @xmath16 10@xmath17 @xmath18/vs at 1.2 k ( 8 @xmath16 10@xmath19 @xmath18/vs ) , and an electron density @xmath20 @xmath16 10@xmath21 @xmath22 ( 7 @xmath16 10@xmath21 @xmath22 ) .",
    "the two samples differ also by their growth process since sample 1 is an heterojunction , while sample 2 is a quantum well  @xcite .",
    "a particular attention has been paid to the mobility range of the samples chosen to investigate the high - temperature regime of the qhe . on the one hand ,",
    "high enough mobility was required by the need to clearly separate the crossover magnetic field @xmath23 for which the classical localization is expected to set in and the @xmath2-scale where the quantization of the cyclotron motion starts to be felt ( typically , @xmath24 t corresponds to @xmath25 for the lowest temperatures studied here ) . on the other hand , very high mobility samples had to be avoided because of the importance of many - body effects ( such as e.g. spin splitting ) blurring the physics under consideration .",

    "classically , @xmath35 is expected to obey the drude - lorentz law , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the transport time determined by the combined scattering on the ( random ) impurity potential and by phonons . as long as @xmath38 , @xmath35 remains constant , while a quadratic decrease @xmath39 is expected when @xmath40 .",

    "interestingly , we note that this breakdown of drude s law at high @xmath14 appears correlated to the onset of the qhe at low @xmath14 .",
    "because we are working at a relatively high @xmath14 , it is very likely that this breakdown has a purely classical origin .",
    "a linear classical magnetoresistance in several high - mobility samples at high @xmath14 , qualitatively similar to that shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , has already been reported several years ago by rtger _",
    "et al . _",
    "these observations were correlated to the empirical proportionality relation between longitudinal and hall resistances , @xmath46 , originally pointed out in the low temperature quantum hall regime in ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , in the classical hall regime where @xmath47 , this empirical relation predicts a purely linear longitudinal magnetoresistance .",
    "it has been argued that this linear behavior at high temperature could be explained by macroscopic density inhomogeneities in the sample  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we note that this interpretation leaves unexplained the clear transition to the constant drude - lorentz resistance at low magnetic field as observed in our data , see fig .",
    "more recent studies by renard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite evidenced obvious non - linearities in the high @xmath14 magnetoconductance , with a dependence @xmath48 and an exponent @xmath49 .",
    "this translates into a high - field dependence for the conductance @xmath50 , where the exponent @xmath51 .",
    "this turns out to be higher than the value of @xmath52 that we have extracted for sample 1 , but all these measurements concur to invalidate both the high - field drude - lorentz law @xmath53 and the empirical relation ( between @xmath26 and @xmath29 ) leading to @xmath54 .",
    "the appearance of a non - integer exponent @xmath55 is rooted in the percolative nature of transport in actual samples , which is the main issue addressed in this paper .",
    "note that in our other sample 2 , we obtain @xmath56 ( see appendix ) , i.e. , again a non - linearity of the magnetoconductance .",
    "the error bars on the high - field scaling exponent @xmath55 are mainly due to the limited range of magnetic field which can be used , making a very accurate extraction of @xmath55 difficult from a simple field - dependence .",
    "indeed , even at @xmath57 k , landau level quantization gives rise to noticeable quantum oscillations of @xmath35 superposed to the power - law scaling background @xmath58 , since @xmath59 for magnetic field @xmath60",
    "t.    to understand these discrepancies between the different extracted exponents , it is necessary to better characterize the disorder potential in the different samples .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic field dependence of sdh oscillations at temperature @xmath27 k leads to a quantum lifetime @xmath61 ps for sample 1 , and @xmath62 ps for sample 2 .",
    "the transport lifetimes calculated at the same temperature from mobility measurements ( @xmath63 ps in sample 1 , and @xmath64 ps in sample 2 ) are in both samples larger than the quantum lifetimes , what shows the dominant contribution of long range scattering due to a long range disorder potential .",
    "the ratio of the transport time to the single - particle scattering time ( @xmath65 in sample 1 , @xmath66 in sample 2 ) is however not as strong for sample 2 , indicating the non negligible contribution of short range scattering mechanisms in the sample ( such as , e.g. , surface roughness ) , which could be at the origin of the observed discrepancies . with the help of a theoretical analysis of the data to be developped in the next section",
    ", we will first confirm the above exponent values by using in addition the temperature scaling of the magnetoconductance , which will further support the present interpretation for the exponent dispersions .",
    "a breakdown of law ( [ drude ] ) has been predicted in a few theoretical papers @xcite addressing long - range disorder at large magnetic field .",
    "essentially , drude - lorentz formula relies on classical diffusive transport with chaotic electronic motion due to elastic collisions on impurities at low magnetic fields .",
    "when the cyclotron radius becomes basically smaller than the correlation length of the disorder potential , this evolves at high magnetic fields into a quasi - ballistic transport regime with a regular motion of the guiding center along the constant energy contours of the disorder potential landscape , which follows mainly closed trajectories .",
    "macroscopic transport then only takes place by following an extended percolating backbone occurring at a single critical energy and passing through many saddle points of the disorder landscape .",
    "the fractal nature of the percolating contour is expected to give rise to non - trivial universal exponents in the temperature and magnetic field dependences of @xmath35 , as reported here at high magnetic fields .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that the percolating contour alone is not sufficient to allow macroscopic transport , since the guiding center drift velocity vanishes at the saddle - points of the disorder landscape .",
    "different microscopic dissipative processes may a priori be at play to provide a finite drift velocity at these transport bottlenecks , an issue that will be clarified in the present work .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the high temperature crossover field @xmath23 for the drude - lorentz breakdown should be quite close to the low temperature transition between the sdh and qhe regimes .",
    "our experiments in the two samples corroborate this scenario .",
    "however , the classical prediction @xcite of an exponential suppression of @xmath35 with @xmath2 above @xmath23 , which is based on a mechanism of dissipative transport via a stochastic layer around the percolating contour resulting from elastic scattering on the disorder random potential only , is not consistent with the power - law decrease seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , hinting at more efficient relaxation processes .",
    "we now provide detailed theoretical analysis of our experimental data .",
    "the high-@xmath2 percolative transport regime can be described in terms of a ohm s law involving a local conductivity tensor @xcite , which takes the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 encodes dissipative processes ( assumed to be uniform ) , and @xmath69 is the local hall component , whose spatial dependence originates from charge density fluctuations due to disorder @xmath70 in the sample . the local conductivity model expresses the inhomogeneous nature of the high - magnetic field transport , which results from the formation of local equilibrium , and is valid at temperatures high enough so that phase - breaking processes , such as electron - phonon scattering , occur on length scales that are shorter than the typical variations of disorder .",
    "the ohmic conductivity @xmath71 is assumed very weak [ i.e. , @xmath72 but finite .",
    "a priori , it may be due to other scattering mechanisms than elastic impurity scattering such as electron - phonon scattering @xcite .",
    "it has been found @xcite from model ( [ tensor ] ) that the longitudinal conductance scales as @xmath73^{1- \\kappa } \\left| \\frac{e^2}{h } \\sqrt{\\langle v^2 \\rangle } \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } n'_f(e_n-\\mu ) \\right|^{\\kappa}\\!\\!\\ ! , \\label{sigmal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a non - trivial exponent previously conjectured @xcite to be @xmath74 , a result confirmed recently by a diagrammatic approach @xcite .",
    "here @xmath75 is a nonuniversal dimensionless constant , @xmath76 is the chemical potential , and @xmath77 is the derivative of the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "formula ( [ sigmal ] ) has been established under the assumption that @xmath69 follows _ linearly _ the spatial fluctuations of disorder @xmath70 , what requires a sufficiently high @xmath14 .",
    "typically , it does not describe the low temperature regime  @xcite when the peak conductance starts to level off around conductance values of the order of @xmath78 ( per spin ) .",
    "another important limitation of formula  ( [ sigmal ] ) is the assumption of a gaussian correlated disorder with a single correlation length , which is valid for impurities located far away from the gas and in absence of sources of short - range impurity scattering .",
    "for instance , sample 2 ( a quantum well ) is likely characterized by multi - scale disorder , which would involve extra ( unknown ) microscopic parameters in the modelling , making difficult a quantitative comparison to theory ( see discussion in appendix ) .",
    "in addition , model  ( [ tensor ] ) leads  @xcite to the conventional classical hall s law at @xmath79 , where fingerprints of percolations are absent .",
    "it predicts therefore a slight breakdown of the empirical proportionality law ( between @xmath29 and @xmath26 ) due to the non - linearity related to the non - integer exponent @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , this gives at high magnetic field @xmath80 , which is non - linear for @xmath81 .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite however that the presence of disorder on multiple length scales tends to increase the exponent @xmath55 towards 1 , thus recovering the empirical proportionality law in the case of more inhomogeneous samples .",

    "[ fig3 ] the presence of a pronounced minimum at a temperature that perfectly correlates for each peak with the scale @xmath88 where quantized landau levels start to emerge , a striking effect that went previously unnoticed to our knowledge . in addition , two different power - law scalings ( with a negative power at @xmath89 and positive one at @xmath90 ) are clearly seen , that we would like to attribute to the critical state associated to classical percolation .",
    "it can be easily noted from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the classical conductance seems to scale as @xmath91 for @xmath90 , what implies a linear temperature dependence for @xmath68 according to eq .",

    ". its origin may be the inelastic electrons - phonons scattering , as has been put forward in many theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the electrons undergo a large number of scattering events on the phonons , i.e. , their rate @xmath92 is much higher than the characteristic frequency of drift motion , we can estimate the _ short - distance _ dissipative conductivity @xmath68 using the drude - lorentz formula @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the electron - phonon scattering time .",
