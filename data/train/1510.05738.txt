    "the deployment of systems that provide for the distribution of entangled quantum states via satellite would represent an important step in the pursuit of a global quantum communications network @xcite .",
    "however , a serious issue that will be faced by such systems is the unavoidable degradation of entanglement caused by atmospheric effects , most notably atmospheric turbulence @xcite . from the perspective of future quantum communications , it is therefore important to fully quantify this anticipated entanglement degradation , and to pursue system designs that minimize it .    in the continuous - variable ( cv ) space",
    ", previous efforts in this regard have largely focussed on the transmittance of gaussian entangled states through atmospheric channels @xcite .",
    "although gaussian quantum states are a well - established resource from both a theoretical and an experimental perspective ( for review see@xcite ) , the use of cv non - gaussian quantum states as a means for quantum communication has also garnered interest @xcite .",
    "consideration of non - gaussian states is interesting for many reasons , including teleportation @xcite , and cloning @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of quantum communications via satellite , entangled non - gaussian states are particularly interesting for two key reasons .",
    "first , non - gaussian states can undergo entanglement distillation without the requirement for further non - gaussian operations or de - gaussification procedures - an outcome forbidden for gaussian states @xcite .",
    "second , in some circumstances , the entanglement intrinsic to non - gaussian states is more robust against decoherence compared to the entanglement intrinsic to gaussian states @xcite .",
    "previous works @xcite on the robustness of non - gaussian entanglement have focussed on noisy _ fixed _ attenuation ( or amplification ) channels .",
    "however , illuminating as such studies are we note that the turbulent atmosphere between ground and low - earth orbit ( leo ) leads to an attenuation channel that is highly _",
    "stochastic _ in nature ( i.e. a fading channel ) .",
    "as such , in the context of entanglement transfer through atmospheric channels towards ( and from ) leo , it remains unclear if non - gaussian states actually represent an effective resource relative to gaussian states .",
    "further , in operational modes the non - deterministic nature of the operations that produce many non - gaussian states can have a dramatic effect on their perceived usefulness @xcite .",
    "for example , in the deployment scenario we focus on in this work , most of the non - gaussian entangled states will be created dynamically via non - gaussian operations on input two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) states that would otherwise be used directly in the communication channel .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to include both channel fading and non - deterministic production effects in a detailed comparison study of the ground - to - leo ( and vice - versa ) entanglement - generation rates offered by a wide class of non - gaussian entangled states .",
    "our initial focus will be the use of such states in _ first - generation _ deployments aimed at delivering real - time quantum keys between earth and leo satellites , without the assistance of any entanglement distillation , post - selection , or quantum memory .",
    "later in the paper we will explore the impact such assistance can have on the outcomes of second - generation deployments .",
    "we will also discuss our results in the context of the most well - known non - gaussian entangled state - single photons combined into a bell pair .",
    "the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we detail our system model , and describe the evolution of our entangled states over the atmospheric channel . in sec .",
    "iii we present our key results . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the potential impact of distillation , post - selection , and quantum memory ; and provide a comparison with single - photon technologies in the context of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "we outline our system model , the quantum entangled states adopted , the evolution of the states through the atmospheric channel , and determination of the final entanglement .      in free - space channels the transmittance fluctuates due to atmospheric effects .",
    "such fading channels can be characterized by a distribution of transmittance ( transmission ) factors @xmath0 with a probability density distribution @xmath1 .",

    "however , we note that @xmath29 is an upper bound on the distillable entanglement.$ ] where @xmath147 is the negativity of a state that has traversed a channel of transmittance @xmath145 . ]",
    "we also note that the conditional entropy provides a lower bound on the distillable entanglement @xcite .",
    "the conditional entropy is calculated as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the conditional entropy of a state that has traversed a channel of transmittance @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath149 is given by @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath102 is the density operator of the state after each realization of @xmath145 , and @xmath152 refers to its reduced density operator with respect to the mode  1 .",
    "the rate for the tmsv state ( marked as tmsv ( lower bound ) ) based on the conditional entropy is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "since the tmsv state after each realization of @xmath145 is still gaussian , its conditional entropy can be calculated from its covariance matrix . for a given covariance matrix in the form of @xmath153 ,",
    "the entropies can be calculated as @xmath154 and @xmath155 , where @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , where @xmath158 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] that distillation on the non - gaussian states shown will not lead to any improvement in the entanglement - generation rates relative to those from the tmsv state ( the distillable entanglement lower bound on the tmsv state is greater than the upper bounds on non - gaussian states ) .",
    "this same conclusion is reached for all other non - gaussian states studied .",
    "in fact , @xmath138 of the other non - gaussian states studied is below that of the non - gaussian states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "this figure also shows the tmsv rate based on its conditional entropy in the case of a noisy asymmetric channel with @xmath159 .",
    "as we can see for losses greater than about 10db the distillable entanglement lower bound on the tmsv state falls below the upper limit on the non - gaussian states . for a noisy asymmetric channel and initial squeezing of 10db on the initial tmsv state",
    ", we find @xmath160 must be less than approximately @xmath161 ( an attainable limit ) for our argument on no improvement from distillation to be valid across all channels losses we consider",
    ". a similar result would apply to the symmetric case .",
    "distillation can still play a role in enhancing the quality ( entanglement ) of a received state relative to direct transmission of a tmsv state .",
    "however , the results of fig .  [ fig:6 ]",
    "( even though they apply only strictly in the infinite limit of state number ) do imply that for optimizing _ the number of received pulses above a specific entanglement target _ in a low - noise channel , direct transmission of modestly squeezed tmsv states would be superior ( the more squeezing the better ) .",
    "of course this last implication could be altered if a generation rate of non - gaussian states beyond that adopted here could be achieved .",
    "one route to this would be through the availability of a long - term quantum memory coupled to a form of classical post - selection at the receiver .",
    "in such a scenario the receiver will feedback to the sender a transmittance measurement of the channel - possible due to the long coherence time of the channel ( in the milliseconds range ) . on receipt of this classical message ,",
    "the sending station will make a decision on whether to send the non - gaussian states previously stored in memory ( in addition to those being produced from the tmsv state ) dependent on the transmittance measurement being above some threshold @xmath162 .",
    "when below this threshold the sending station stores all non - gaussian states produced from the tmsv state .",
    "consider the following relation for some atmospheric channel and for some non - gaussian state created from a squeezed tmsv , @xmath163 where @xmath164 $ ] , and @xmath165 is the logarithmic negativity of the non - gaussian ( gaussian ) state that has traversed a channel of transmittance @xmath145 . if there existed a non - gaussian state that satisfied eq .",
    "for some @xmath166 , then a quantum memory that could store the non - gaussian state for a timescale of order @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the channel coherence timescale , would provide equality of the entanglement rates produced by the gaussian and non - gaussian states .",
    "however , for the non - gaussian states we have adopted ( and their associated @xmath139 values ) , we find no solution to eq .   for some @xmath166 in any realistic channel settings ( and useful initial squeezing values ) .",
    "further , in this discussion we have ignored gains to be had by also storing the tmsv state . as such",
    ", a more likely use of quantum memory in the context of high - loss atmospheric channels would be in situations where both types of states are stored in memory so as to produce a true ` on - demand ' system . assuming only output from the quantum memory is used for transmission , the entanglement rate generated between stations ( by any state ) would simply increase linearly with the timescale of the memory .    finally , it is perhaps worth considering our results in relation to the entanglement generation - rate over atmospheric channels achievable by the transfer of single photons ( quantum communication with leo using single - photon technology has been achieved recently @xcite ) . in the single - photon setting the loss manifests itself directly as a reduced detection rate .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ( top ) shows @xmath169 , the ratio of the entanglement - generation rate , @xmath138 , achieved by asymmetric transfer of the tmsv state ( our state with the highest @xmath138 ) to that achieved by single photon transfer . here",
    "we have assumed the channel transmittance is measured , the single photon is the entangled partner of a bell pair , and the rate of tmsv generation is equal to the rate of bell - pair generation .",
    "we have set @xmath128 for the cv entanglement determination , but have ignored any additional noise terms in the single - photon detectors or any reduction in the bell pair entanglement caused by secondary channel effects ( e.g. depolarization ) .",
    "we have also assumed a perfect bell pair source ( i.e. only pure two - photon bell states produced ) .",
    "the ratio of the entanglement rates are shown as a function of the initial squeezing of the tmsv state , and as a function of the fading channel loss . from this idealized",
    "setting for the single - photon production , we can see that above approximately 3db squeezing ( current state - of - the - art is @xmath170db @xcite ) the entanglement in the tmsv states dominates for all fading losses studied .",
    "the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ( top ) is of limited value in its own right for several reasons , most important of which is the fact that the forms of entanglement being compared are fundamentally different .",
    "a true comparison of the merits of cv versus bell - pair entanglement technologies is complex and ultimately requires performance evaluation in the context of some operational measure ( indeed operational measures are useful even in comparison amongst cv states - entanglement is not always a unique measure of operational efficiency ) .",
    "an important operational measure would be the key rates of qkd .",
    "the results shown in the middle figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] for the same asymmetric setting illustrate the ratio , defined as @xmath171 , of the key rates of a cv entanglement - based qkd scheme relative to a discrete entanglement - based qkd scheme . for the cv case",
    ", we have adopted the secret key rate @xmath172 ( bits per initial pulse ) of a reverse reconciliation scheme with homodyne detection by the sender and receiver .",
    "this is derived as @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the key rate resulting from a tmsv state that has traversed a channel of transmittance @xmath145 ( we do not investigate key rates generated by our non - gaussian states due to their low production rates in realistic operational settings ) .",
    "since the tmsv state after each realization of @xmath145 is still gaussian , the cv key rate can be calculated through the use of eqs .",

    "the secret key rate @xmath175 ( bits per initial pulse ) can be derived as @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the key rate resulting from a state ( described by eq .",
    "( 2 ) of @xcite ) that has traversed a channel of transmittance @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath177 is determined through the use of eqs .",
    "( 9)-(12 ) of @xcite , with the variables defined in @xcite set as @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and a value of @xmath183 .",
    "is effectively optimal .",
    "if put to a more practical setting of say @xmath184 ( as discussed in @xcite ) the probability of producing a single two photon bell states is significantly reduced , and the ratio @xmath171 would then be about twice that shown . ]",
    "the ratio @xmath171 is then given by @xmath185 .",
    "note , this ratio implicitly assumes the number of exchanges between sender and receiver are infinite .",
    "note also , in order to largely remove detector issues from the comparison we have set all detector efficiencies to @xmath186 ( the efficiency of the homodyne detectors will likely be larger in practice ) .    as can be seen from this middle figure , significant enhancements in cv qkd relative to discrete qkd are present .",
    "of course , any comparison of cv qkd and discrete qkd is ultimately more complex than that provided here .",
    "quite different detectors are deployed in the different schemes ( different efficiencies , dark counts , etc . ) and variants on the implementation strategies ( and assumptions adopted ) of both schemes are available which can impact final key rates significantly .",
    "nonetheless , the results of the entanglement - based qkd comparison shown in fig .  [ fig : ratio ] ( middle ) are indicative of the intrinsic advantage infinite - dimension hilbert space systems possess , and show that this advantage can persist over the fading channels anticipated for communications between terrestrial stations and low - earth orbit satellites .    in the bottom figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we repeat our comparison of the quantum key rates just described , but this time for _ fixed _ channel losses .",
