    "the starting formula in calculations of the casimir energy @xmath0 requires the knowledge of the spectrum of the quantum field model under consideration @xcite . for this aim",
    "the boundary conditions at the spatial infinity should be imposed on the field in the case of an unbounded configuration space . making here use of the _ radiation condition _ leads , as a rule , to a _ complex discrete energy spectrum _",
    "( open systems with energy losses due to the outgoing waves ) .",
    "in this situation a more admissible is the condition utilized in formulation of the scattering problem , i.e. , at the spatial infinity the filed should be _ a sum of incoming and outgoing waves_. the spectrum of the same hamiltonian with scattering conditions is nonnegative but continuous , and the respective natural modes are not squared integrable . in order to define a correct integration over such a spectrum",
    "one has to introduce _ the spectral density _ , which is expressed in terms of the jost function of the relevant scattering problem .",
    "the frequency equation , which is derived by making use of the radiation condition , is related , in a direct way , with the jost function . as a result",
    "the final formulas for the spectral sums and spectral integrals turn out to be identical in the end .",
    "thus it is proposed a rigorous justification of the results of casimir calculations obtained by employment of the radiation condition and frequency equations with discrete set of complex roots .",
    "here we show in the general case in what way complex frequencies and quasi - normal modes appear when considering harmonic oscillations in unbounded regions . let a closed smooth surface @xmath1 divides the @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space @xmath3 into a compact internal region @xmath4 and noncompact external region @xmath5 .",
    "we consider here a simple scalar wave equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity of oscillation propagation and @xmath8 is the laplace operator in @xmath3 . for harmonic oscillations",
    "@xmath9 the wave equation ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) is reduced to the helmholtz equation @xmath10    the oscillations in the internal region @xmath4 are described by an infinite countable set of normal modes @xmath11 the spatial form of the normal modes ( the functions @xmath12 ) is determined by the boundary conditions which are imposed upon the function @xmath13 on the internal side of the surface @xmath1 .",
    "these conditions should fit the physical content of the problem under study .",
    "the set of normal modes is a complete one .",
    "hence any solution of ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) obeying relevant boundary conditions can be expanded in terms of the normal modes  @xmath12 .    when considering the oscillations in the external domain @xmath14 one imposes , in addition to the conditions on the compact surface @xmath1 , a special requirement concerning the behavior of the function @xmath13 at large @xmath15 . usually for this purpose the radiation boundary conditions , proposed by sommerfeld  @xcite ,",
    "are used @xmath16 for real values of the wave vector @xmath17 ( for real frequencies @xmath18 ) the solution to ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) , which obeys the radiation conditions ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) and reasonable boundary condition on a compact surface @xmath1 , identically vanishes .",
    "if we remove the requirement of reality of the wave vector @xmath17 , then the statement , formulated above , does not hold .",
    "namely , the wave equation ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) and the helmholtz equation ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) have nonzero solutions with complex frequencies , these solutions obeying the radiation boundary conditions ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) and a common condition on a closed compact surface @xmath1 ( for instance , dirichlet or neumann conditions ) .    as a very simple and clear example we consider the oscillations of electromagnetic field outside a perfectly conducting sphere of radius @xmath19 . in this case the electric and magnetic fields are expressed in terms of two scalar functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( debye potentials ) which are the radial parts of the solutions to the scalar wave equation ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) . outside the perfectly conducting sphere placed in vacuum the solution to the helmholtz equation ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) obeying the radiation conditions ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) has the form @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spherical hankel function of the first kind @xcite . at the surface of perfectly conducting sphere",
    "the tangential component of the electric field should vanish .",
    "this leads to the following frequency equation for te - modes @xmath25 and for tm - modes @xmath26 the spherical hankel function @xmath27 is @xmath28 multiplied by the polynomial in @xmath29 of a finite order . hence frequency equations ( [ 2 - 7 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) have a finite number of roots , which are in the general case complex numbers . for @xmath30 ( the lowest oscillations ) equations ( [ 2 - 7 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) assume the form @xmath31 @xmath32 thus the lowest eigenfrequencies are @xmath33 the complex eigenfrequencies lead to a specific time and spatial dependence of the respective natural modes and ultimately of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "so , with allowance of ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) , we obtain @xmath34    thus , the eigenfunctions are exponentially going down in time and exponentially going up when @xmath35 increases .",
    "such time and spatial behaviour is typical for eigenfunctions describing oscillations in external unbounded regions , the physical content and details of oscillation process being irrelevant .",
    "the eigenfunctions corresponding to complex eigenvalues are called _ quasi - normal modes _ keeping in mind their unusual properties  @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of such features is obvious , in fact we are dealing here with _ open systems _ in which the energy can be radiated to infinity . therefore in open systems field can not be in stationary state .",
    "quasi - normal modes do not obey the standard completeness condition and the notion of norm can not be defined for them @xcite .",
    "therefore these eigenfunctions can not be used for expansion of the classical field with the aim to quantize it and to introduce the relevant fock operators .",
    "thus the radiation conditions are not appropriate for the casimir calculations .",
    "the same situation , with regard to quasi - normal modes , takes place when we consider the oscillations of compound media . in this case in both the regions @xmath4 and @xmath5 the wave equations are defined @xmath36 with the matching conditions at the interface @xmath1 , for example , of the following kind @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are normals to the surface @xmath1 at the point @xmath40 for the regions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 specify the material characteristics of the media . at the spatial infinity the solution @xmath45 should satisfy the radiation conditions ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) . for real @xmath17",
    "we again have only zero solution in this problem , both functions @xmath46 and @xmath45 vanishing . however , the wave equations ( [ 2 - 14 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 15 ] ) have nonzero solutions with complex frequencies , i.e.  quasi - normal modes , which satisfy the matching conditions ( [ 2 - 16 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 17 ] ) at the interface @xmath1 and radiation conditions ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) at spatial infinity .",
    "it is important , that the frequencies of oscillations in internal ( @xmath4 ) and external ( @xmath5 ) regions are the same .",
    "a typical example here is the complex eigenfrequencies of a dielectric ball .",
    "this problem has been investigated by debye in his phd thesis concerned with the light pressure on a material ball @xcite .",
    "the physical content of the radiation conditions is very clear .",
    "they select only the oscillations with real frequencies caused by external sources , which are situated in a compact spatial area . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", these conditions ensure the uniqueness of the solution of the nonhomogeneous boundary problems in the external region @xmath5 or in the whole space ( @xmath47 ) in the case of compound media .    when formulating the radiation conditions in the text books , only the real wave vector @xmath17 is considered .",
    "the possibility of existence of quasi - normal modes with complex frequencies satisfying the radiation conditions at spatial infinity with complex wave vector @xmath17 is not mentioned usually .",
    "i am aware only of one literature source where the eigenfunctions with complex frequencies are noted in this context .",
    "it is the article written by sommerfeld in the book  @xcite .",
    "the standard physical method to escape appearance of complex frequencies and quasi - normal modes is the following : the system under study is placed in a sphere of a large radius @xmath48 and the field is subjected to an additional boundary condition on this sphere .",
    "the initial differential operator has now a real discrete spectrum , and the respective eigenfunctions are normalized in @xmath49 . upon conducting the calculations the limit @xmath50 should be taken .",
    "however , in order to justify this approach one has to prove that the final result does not depend on the explicit form of auxiliary boundary conditions imposed on the large sphere @xmath51 . obviously , it is nontrivial task .",
    "furthermore , in this approach always the feeling is rest , that something is lost because the region @xmath52 is actually ignored .",
    "fortuitous , there is a rigorous way to consider the open systems by making use of the formalism of the scattering problem without introducing a large auxiliary sphere .",
    "in the scattering problem the same differential operator ( for example , the laplace operator ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) ) is considered , but instead of the radiation conditions ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) it is required that the eigenfunctions @xmath53 at spatial infinity @xmath54 are reduced to the sum of incoming and outgoing waves @xmath55{,}\\quad r\\to\\infty \\,{.}\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the jost function , and spherical symmetry in the problem under consideration is expected .",
    "the operators of the type @xmath57 have real continuous spectrum @xmath58 when the potential @xmath59 obeys known conditions at @xmath60 and at infinity @xmath61 .    due to the continuity of the spectrum the corresponding eigenfunctions are not normalized in @xmath49 . making here use of the normalization on the dirack @xmath62-function proves to be useful in many physical applications ,",
    "however it does not allow one to define , in a correct way , the integration over a continuous spectrum .",
    "indeed , let @xmath63 be the eigenfunctions corresponding to the spectrum ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) normalized on the dirack @xmath62-function @xmath64 for example , those can be plane waves @xmath65 due to its meaning , the spectral density @xmath66 should be defined in the following way @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the volume of the space @xmath69 and obviously @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth noting that the spectral density ( [ 3 - 6 ] ) , considered just on the formal footing , does not depend on the details of the dynamics , i.e.  on the potential @xmath59 and corresponding boundary conditions , therefore it can not be used in physical calculations .    in the rigorous mathematical theory of scattering processes",
    "this problem has been solved . in the most simple way the spectral density for scattering states can be derived as a consequence of a _",
    "spectral property _",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be the resolvents of a complete ( @xmath73 ) and free ( @xmath74 ) hamiltonians .",
    "when the potential meets the relevant conditions , then the relation , known as the spectral property , holds @xmath75 = \\tr\\ ,   [ q(e ) ] \\,{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the two - body time delay operator and @xmath1 is the scattering matrix @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the phase shift and @xmath79 is the jost function .    by making use of the spectral representation for the resolvents and definition ( [ 3 - 6 ] ) one obtains immediately @xmath80 it is worth noting that in this formula the contribution of a free unbounded space is already subtracted .",
    "the finite expression for @xmath81 is a direct consequence of considering complex values of the wave vector @xmath17 and respective energy  @xmath82 .",
    "in the casimir calculations the spectrum of quantum field systems is not known explicitly . as a rule",
    ", it is given by the roots ( @xmath83 ) of a frequency equation @xmath84 with the known function @xmath85 . in order to sum these roots",
    "the counter integration can be used @xmath86 where the counter @xmath87 encloses , counterclockwise , all the roots of ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) .    for a compact configuration space without dissipation",
    "the roots of ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) are real and positive .",
    "the counter @xmath87 can be deformed continuously into the counter @xmath88 with @xmath50 ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "usually @xmath89 , therefore @xmath90 .",
    "the integral along the semicircle of radius @xmath48 vanishes when @xmath91 or it is canceled by the subtraction of the free space contribution . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath92    let us derive the analog of ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) for the open systems . according to the inferences of the previous section we have to consider the following integral along the continuous spectrum @xmath93 where @xmath79 is the jost function in the pertinent scattering problem .",
    "this function is analytic in the lower half plane of the complex variable @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that there are no bound states in the system in question . under this assumption",
    "the zeros of the jost function @xmath79 can lay only in the upper half plane @xmath17 @xcite . in view of this",
    "we infer that the counter integrals ( see figure 1b ) @xmath94 vanish because inside the counter @xmath95 there are no zeros and singularities of the function @xmath96 .",
    "now we can transform in ( [ 4 - 4 ] ) the integration along the real positive axes @xmath17 to the integration along the imaginary frequencies @xmath97 with the result @xmath98     plane which are used when going on to the integration over the imaginary frequencies in the case of bounded ( a ) and unbounded ( b ) configuration spaces.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]   plane which are used when going on to the integration over the imaginary frequencies in the case of bounded ( a ) and unbounded ( b ) configuration spaces.,title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    now we take into account the following .",
    "the function @xmath99 in frequency equation ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) , which is derived by making use of the radiation conditions at spatial infinity , is actually the jost function up to irrelevant multiplier .",
    "indeed , the solution ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) will contain only outgoing waves when @xmath100 for simplicity we have dropped here the index @xmath101 .",
    "thus we have @xmath102 now we can infer that the right - hand sides of ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 - 6 ] ) coincide . hence , the formula ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) with the function @xmath85 defining the frequency equation is applicable also to unbounded configuration spaces .",
    "all this removes the objections @xcite against using ( [ 4 - 3 ] ) for unbounded regions and explains why it gives correct results there  @xcite .",
    "importance of proper choosing conditions , imposed on the field at spatial infinity when determining the physical spectrum in casimir calculations , is illustrated by a circular infinite dielectric cylinder .",
    "if we confine our consideration to the oscillating asymptotics for @xmath61 the spectrum of maxwell equations is continuous .",
    "only this situation has been considered in all pertinent papers ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however from the physical point of view are acceptable also solutions exponentially going down when @xmath61 .",
    "it is these configurations of electromagnetic field ( surface waves with discrete spectrum ) that are used in dielectric wavegaudes  @xcite .",
    "thus the question arises whether this branch of spectrum has been taken into account in relevant calculations .",
    "casimir studies , which allow for the material properties of the boundaries , show importance of the surface waves , or more precisely , of surface plasmon contributions @xcite at short distances ( regime without retardation ) .",
    "obviously , such bound states should be added to the spectral density  ( [ 3 - 9 ] ) .",
