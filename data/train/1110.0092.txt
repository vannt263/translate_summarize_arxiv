    "the specific heat is a bulk thermodynamic quantity determined uniquely for every material by its spectrum of excitations .",
    "the measurement of the specific heat is a basic technique to reveal the physical properties of a material because it can , in principle , be calculated _ ab initio _ from a suitable physical model .",
    "the prediction of a linear specific heat , for example , is one of the most important consequences of fermi - dirac statistics for electrons in a metal , and its measurement provides a simple test to the electron gas theory of a metal .",
    "because the specific heat is a quantity that is probing the whole sample volume , it is significant to characterize volume effects such as the superconducting state in a material .",
    "therefore , specific - heat measurements have traditionally been of great importance for investigations in the field of superconductivity .",
    "the electronic specific heat of superconductors can be expected to yield information about the nature of the superconducting state ; and its temperature ( @xmath4 ) dependence should in particular be related to the energy gap @xcite .",
    "specific - heat measurements can also provide information about fluctuation effects @xcite , and they are particularly suited to measure phase transitions and to explore the phase diagram of superconductors .",
    "improvements in the techniques for specific - heat measurements are therefore of special value . as an example",
    ", the first - order nature of the melting of the flux - line lattice in high - temperature superconductors in the mixed state has been unambiguously proven for the first time by high - resolution specific - heat measurements based on a differential - thermal analysis ( dta ) method developed for this purpose @xcite . the dta method used in our laboratory",
    "is particularly suited to detect sharp phase transitions , e.g. , first - order phase transitions , and it does not require large sample masses . since high - quality samples often only exist in form of small crystals , such a sensitive method is of particular interest .",
    "in addition , it is often desirable to choose a method that yields a high data - point density within a reasonable measuring time .",
    "common techniques , such as standard heat - pulse or relaxation methods , are sensitive but very time consuming . as an example",
    ", the relaxation method implemented in a commercial ppms platform ( quantum design ) usually takes several _ minutes _ per data point for data acquisition , while the dta technique takes only approximately @xmath5s per data point , at an impressive data - point density of typically @xmath6 data points per kelvin . high resolution and high data - point density",
    "are needed for the observation of small and sharp effects . in the first part of this work we are comparing corresponding dta measurements on v@xmath0si , luni@xmath1b@xmath1c , and nbse@xmath1 with measurements done in a commercial ppms platform and with data from the literature , with a special focus on the transition width of the normal to the superconducting state .",
    "+ historically , specific - heat ( @xmath3 ) measurements using dta techniques have been proven to be particularly powerful when studying relative changes in @xmath3 at sharp phase transitions .",
    "however , to extract exact absolute values , or to identify smooth , featureless trends ( such as the exact functional temperature dependence of @xmath3 ) , is not easy using this technique due to various reasons @xcite . in superconductors ,",
    "not only the discontinuity in the specific heat at @xmath7 contains valuable information about the superconducting state , but also the temperature and the field dependence of this quantity below @xmath7 are of utmost interest . from the temperature dependence @xmath8 one can draw conclusions about zeroes in the gap function , which may help clarify questions about the nature of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "a power - law dependence of @xmath3 on temperature has been observed , for example , in yba@xmath1cu@xmath0o@xmath9 @xcite , with a @xmath10 term for a magnetic field @xmath11 and an @xmath12 term for @xmath13 and low @xmath4 , with a crossover to a stronger @xmath4 dependence at high @xmath4 .",
    "peculiar @xmath4 dependencies , very distinct from the standard one - band _ s_-wave exponential law , can also be expected in multigap superconductors , as has been measured for example in mgb@xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the field dependence of @xmath14 at constant temperature may also be influenced by the symmetry of the order parameter and also by other factors @xcite . in the second part of this manuscript",
    "we show that specific - heat data from dta measurements can , to some extent , also give useful information on absolute values of @xmath3 , and in particular reveal trends even in the absence of a sharp phase transition .",
