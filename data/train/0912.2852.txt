    "the performance of interferometers at ( sub)millimetre wavelengths is often limited by differential fluctuations in the atmospheric path along the line of sight to each of the constituent antennas .",
    "if uncorrected , these fluctuations lead to a loss in sensitivity , imaging artefacts and a limit on the maximum usable baseline ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alma will correct such path variations using a combination of techniques :    1 .",
    "fast - switching observations of bright calibrator sources ( e.g.  quasars ) .",
    "water vapour radiometry using dedicated 183-ghz radiometers ( wvrs ) , installed in every 12-m alma antenna .",
    "the wvrs will allow the retrieval of the amount of water vapour along the line of sight to each antenna and thus fluctuations in the atmospheric path length resulting from this water vapour .",
    "3 .   self calibration , for a fraction of the brightest science targets .    fast switching interleaves science observations with short ( @xmath2 a few seconds ) calibration observations on a cycle time of 20200s .",
    "these calibrations allow an estimate of the atmospheric and instrumental phase errors _ in the direction of the calibrator_. the applicability of the calibrator phase solutions to the science target depends on their angular separation and the observing frequency",
    ". the radiometric technique will be applied _",
    "continuously _ , correcting for atmospheric path fluctuations on timescales shorter than the fast - switching cycle time , but does require an accurate model to convert the wvr measurements into path delays .",
    "variations in the atmospheric path delay to the antennas predominantly arise from a combination of fluctuations in the water vapour content _ and _ density of air in the troposphere  respectively , the so - called wet and dry path components .",
    "furthermore , we can split both components ( the wet and dry ) into two parts : one dispersive ( i.e.  dependent on frequency ) and the other non - dispersive ( independent of frequency ) .",
    "conventionally , the non - dispersive part is taken to be the path in the low - frequency limit .",
    "this memo focuses on the dispersive part of the wet path delay introduced by the atmosphere .",
    "previously , atmospheric dispersion in the context of fast switching was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found the magnitude of the dispersive phase will become non - negligible in alma s submillimetre bands .",
    "furthermore , @xcite quantified the dispersive phase delay for _ typical _ conditions at the alma site .",
    "we extend their work by investigating how the dispersive path delay depends on the _ variation _ of the physical parameters of the atmosphere and what constraints can be placed on it from the proposed ancillary calibration devices on site .",
    "this memo is structured into six parts .",
    "first , we explain the planned phase - correction strategy for alma and where dispersive effects play a role .",
    "second , in , we describe how dispersive and non - dispersive path delays arise in the atmosphere and how we compute the dispersive path delay . also quantifies the dispersive path delay across the full range of alma observing frequencies , before demonstrates how varying different atmospheric parameters changes the magnitude of the dispersive path delay .",
    "finally , we look at what constraints can be placed on the dispersive path delay with temperature measurements from weather - monitoring devices .",
    "before we consider the magnitude of the dispersive path delay , we will detail the current phase - correction plans for alma and how these are affected by atmospheric dispersion .",
    "numerous previous memos have discussed fast - switching phase correction for alma ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , fast switching removes some of the antenna - based phase fluctuations by regularly making short observations of a bright point - source calibrator , close to the science target in the sky .",
    "this difference in direction between the target and calibrator means the calibration solutions need to be interpolated to estimate the science target s phase errors .    typically , at alma s highest observing frequencies , it will be unlikely that the calibrations can be taken at the same frequency as the science observations , for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "calibrators of the necessary strength at the science frequency will probably be too far from the science target ( although this depends on the source counts at high frequencies , which are currently not well known ) .",
    "2 .   the combination of high frequencies and long baselines may resolve many potential calibrators .",
    "3 .   the phase errors may prove to be so large that phase wrapping makes reliable solutions difficult .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "one proposal is for alma to observe calibration sources at 90ghz when necessary and then scale the corresponding phase solutions to the science frequency ( the _ phase - transfer _ technique ) .",
    "the frequency above which the phase transfer - approach will be necessary depends on the array configuration , atmospheric conditions and ultimately experience gathered at the site .",
    "it is currently expected to be the routine mode at wavelengths below 2 mm ( frequencies @xmath3ghz ) . in the absence of dispersion ,",
    "the required phase scaling is simply the ratio of the calibration and science frequencies .",
    "however , at high frequencies , as we have already mentioned and will detail below , the numerous nearby water vapour lines ensure that atmospheric dispersion will need to be taken into account .",
    "fluctuations in the atmospheric path on timescales shorter than the fast - switching cycle time will be corrected radiometrically using wvrs installed in every 12-m alma antenna .",
    "the wvrs measure the brightness of the 183-ghz atmospheric water line , which is very sensitive to the total amount of water vapour in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the fundamental difficulty in the analysis of wvr data is how to convert fluctuations in the measured sky brightnesses around the 183-ghz water line into variations in the atmospheric path delay .",
    "we have begun to develop a bayesian framework for computing such conversion factors @xcite , which naturally incorporates the prior knowledge of the system and all the observable data . in the first memo @xcite , we begin with the simplest possible model atmosphere , comprising a single , thin layer of water , which is the only cause of path fluctuations .",
    "even so , an analysis of test data from prototype wvrs that were installed on the submillimeter array ( sma ) yields corrections that are within @xmath4per cent of optimal ones .",
    "memo 588 @xcite extends this scheme to include the observed correlation between phase and sky brightness , which alma may implicitly record during fast switching , when the calibrator s phase is measured whilst data are taken with the wvrs .",
    "the inclusion of this empirical relationship should significantly improve the accuracy of the phase correction .",
    "typically , the calculation of phase - correction coefficients ( i.e.the conversion factors above ) from wvr data requires a model of the atmosphere , which in principle can be used to estimate the dispersive as well as non - dispersive path delays . in our work to date , which was based on relatively low - frequency ( 220ghz ) data , we have not modelled the dispersive path contribution .",
    "instead , we simply scale the non - dispersive path delay by a constant factor to estimate the total wet delay .",
    "however , in reality this factor is a function of frequency .",
    "furthermore , if the dispersive contribution is a significant fraction of the total path delay , it must be determined with good accuracy . to date",
    "there has been little work on what atmospheric properties influence the magnitude of the dispersive path delay and by what amount . in",
    ", we therefore examine the variation of the dispersive path delay using multiple realistic models of the atmosphere above the alma site .",
    "fluctuations in the wet path delay , @xmath5 , are separated into the sum of non - dispersive ( @xmath6 ) and dispersive delays ( @xmath7 ) :      the _ total _ non - dispersive path delay ( i.e.  the sum of the wet and dry components ) can be computed from the smith - weintraub equation for the refractive index , @xmath9 , at a temperature , @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11\\rmn{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the partial pressures of the dry air and water vapour respectively and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants .",
    "since we are only concerned with the excess path introduced by water vapour ( i.e.  d@xmath17 above ) , then we may omit the first term and of the remaining terms the last one dominates .",
    "hence we can transform to the following expression @xcite:@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the water vapour column .    in general , atmospheres with spectral lines",
    "are dispersive , with the dispersion related to the absorption according to the kramers - krnig relations .",
    "thus , any atmospheric property that affects the shapes of absorption - line features will probably influence the atmospheric dispersion , summarized in the following functional form ( see for a list of the symbols used ) :          we calculate the dispersive and non - dispersive contributions to the wet and dry path delays between 1ghz and 1thz from model atmospheres using the atmsoftware @xcite .",
    "atmaccurately predicts the atmospheric opacity above mauna kea , hawaii up to 1.6thz @xcite .",
    "its dispersive calculations have not been as thoroughly verified due to a lack of high - frequency test data , which should change in the near future once the alma wvrs become operational at chajnantor .    in , we plot the wet and dry , dispersive and non - dispersive path delays overlaid on top of the atmospheric transmission , all computed using the basic model parameters listed in , which are suitable for the alma array operations site ( aos ) at chajnantor .",
    "the parameters listed in are the median values measured by site - monitoring equipment where possible and their origin will be detailed in later sections .",
    "the computed dispersive path delay is small except around the atmospheric h@xmath22olines ( for the wet component ) or o@xmath22lines ( for the dry ) .",
    "the largest contribution to the total delay at all frequencies arises from the dry non - dispersive path delay .",
    "however , we expect the dry column to be relatively stable and so contribute very little to the _ differential _ path delay @xcite i.e.the difference in delay between antennas .",
    "we will ignore the dry path delays for the rest of this memo but they may prove to be a significant extra source of error that remain after phase correction using the wvrs ."
