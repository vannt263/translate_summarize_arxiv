    "the elusiveness so far of any clear deviation from the standard model ( sm ) in flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) amplitudes poses problems to phenomenological supersymmetry , arguably even more than the lack of direct signals of any s - particle . since the early times the supersymmetric flavour problem has been the subject of many investigations with several suggestions for its possible solution .",
    "however the remarkable progression of the flavour tests achieved in the last years has rendered the problem more acute .",
    "while deviations from the sm could be hiding just around the corner , as perhaps even hinted by recent data , the overall quantitative success of the sm in describing many measured fcnc effects calls for a reconsideration of the issue .",
    "broadly speaking one can group the various attempts at addressing the supersymmetric flavour problem in three categories : `` degeneracy '' @xcite@xcite , `` alignment '' @xcite or `` hierarchy''@xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we follow a specific direction centered on the special role of the top yukawa coupling and , by extension , of the full yukawa couplings for the up - type quarks .",
    "we base its implementation on a definite pattern of flavour symmetry breaking , which will result in a kind of blending of the three different approaches just mentioned .",
    "our assumptions are the following :    * among the squarks , only those that interact with the higgs system via the top yukawa coupling are significantly lighter than the others . * with only the up - yukawa couplings , @xmath0 , turned on , but not the down - yukawa couplings , @xmath1 , there is no flavour transition between the different families .",
    "the first assumption is in line with the `` hierarchical '' picture .",
    "on one side the tight constraints on the flavour structure of the first two generations of squarks , @xmath2 , by kaon physics get relaxed by taking @xmath2 sufficiently heavy . on the other side",
    "the naturalness upper bounds on all the squarks that do no feel the top yukawa couplings , i.e. again @xmath2 and the right - handed sbottom , are much looser than for all the other s - particles@xcite .",
    "the second assumption corresponds to the `` alignment '' between @xmath0 and the squared mass matrices of the left - handed doublet squarks , @xmath3 , and of the right - handed singlet squarks of charge 2/3 , @xmath4 .",
    "this alignment can result from a suitable pattern of flavour symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath5 limit , the largest flavour symmetry consistent with the above hypotheses is @xmath6 where @xmath7 acts as baryon number but only on the supermultiplets @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the i - th generation , respectively the left - handed doublets and the charge-2/3 right - handed singlets , whereas @xmath10 acts on the three right - handed supermultiplets of charge 1/3 .",
    "we are going to analyze in detail the consequences of this flavour symmetry , assumed to be broken down to overall baryon number by the small @xmath1 couplings only . throughout this paper",
    "we take @xmath11 , as usually defined in supersymmetric models , below about 10 .",
    "smaller symmetries that are interesting to consider as well are @xmath12 and @xmath13 always broken by the ( supersymmetric ) down - yukawa couplings only .",
    "needless to say , when @xmath1 is switched on , @xmath10 still implies approximate degeneracy of all the right - handed down squarks , whereas only the first two generations are approximately degenerate in the @xmath14 case .",
    "these symmetries can be compared , for @xmath15 , to @xmath16 that leads , under suitable further hypotheses , to minimal flavour violation ( mfv)@xcite of the fcnc amplitudes .",
    "let us analyze the consequences of ( [ u3 ] ) . in the physical basis for the charge 2/3 quarks , where we work from now on , the squared mass matrices @xmath17 and the a - terms for the charge 2/3 squarks are flavour diagonal , up to possible corrections controlled by @xmath1 .",
    "we promote @xmath1 to a non - dynamical spurion field transforming under ( [ u3 ] ) in such a way that the down - quark yukawa couplings , @xmath18 , are formally invariant . in this case",
    "the symmetry - breaking corrections to the diagonal mass matrices are at least quadratic in @xmath1 and can be safely neglected .",
    "this is in view of the non degeneracy of @xmath17 and , in particular , of the large separation between the third and the first two eigenvalues . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass matrices of the up - type squarks , left or right , and of the left down - type squarks are diagonal .",
    "this is unlike the case of the right handed down - squark squared mass matrix , for which @xmath19 where @xmath20 sets the scale of the @xmath21-squark masses , * 1 * is the @xmath22 unit matrix and @xmath23 is an unknown numerical coefficient .",
    "other than ( [ m2d ] ) , the only other mass matrix that needs to be diagonalized is the @xmath24-quark mass matrix , @xmath25 where @xmath26 gev . with @xmath1",
    "expressed in terms of two unitary matrices and its diagonal form , @xmath27 , it is now immediate to go to the full physical basis for all the matter fields .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 can be transformed away both from ( [ m2d ] ) and ( [ md ] ) by a simultaneous unitary rotation of the @xmath29 supermultiplets without affecting any interaction term . on the contrary , by @xmath30 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath31 enters as the only flavour - changing matrix in the interaction terms expressed in the physical basis for all matter fields @xmath32 where terms proportional to @xmath1 have been neglected . as seen from the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ lfc ] )",
    ", @xmath31 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix . in deriving ( [ lfc ] ) we have neglected the mixing between left and right squarks induced by the a - terms .",
    "their introduction would not change the fact that @xmath31 is the only flavour - changing matrix .",
    "furthermore , mild conditions on their size make them only relevant in the @xmath33 mixing , which can be straightforwardly introduced in the analysis .",
    "@xmath34 in ( [ lfc ] ) coincides with the one that would be obtained from ( [ u33 ] ) and @xmath35 were promoted to spurions that keep the supersymmetrized sm yukawa couplings invariant requires in fact some further assumptions on the relative size of the various corrections induced by switching on @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite . ] .",
    "the squark spectrum is , in the two cases , largely different .",
    "the interactions in ( [ lfc ] ) inserted in suitable box diagrams give rise to the following general structure of the @xmath36 effective lagrangian @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( here @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 are functions of the masses of the j - th , k - th generations of up or down squarks , of the charged higgs boson and of the various gaugino , higgsinos .",
    "similarly from penguin - type diagrams one obtains @xmath41 where @xmath42 extends over all the the effective operators @xmath43 relevant to the processes with different final states in @xmath44 fcnc transitions and the functions @xmath45 depend on the masses of the k - th generations of up or down squarks , other than on the masses of the various gaugino , higgsinos and of the charged higgs boson .    to be precise , both ( [ fcnc2 ] ) and ( [ fcnc1 ] ) only include the extra contributions from the sm ones , due to the standard charged current interaction in ( [ lfc ] ) , which however , in the down sector , have exactly the same structure .",
    "the only difference is in the form of the functions @xmath46 and @xmath45 , which , in the sm case , depend on the w mass and on the masses of the up - type quarks of the j - th , k - th generations .",
    "using @xmath47 for any @xmath48 , it is useful to reorganize the various terms in ( [ fcnc2 ] ) as @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 similarly , for the @xmath44 case , @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 in the sm , where , as said , these expressions also apply , the high degeneracy of the up and charm quarks relative to the w mass makes such that only the first terms on the right - hand - sides of ( [ f2dec ] ) and ( [ f1dec ] ) ( for brevity `` the top - quark exchanges '' ) are relevant , or dominate over the others , in every fcnc process , with the exception of the `` real part '' of the @xmath56 transition , where @xmath57 is important .",
    "therefore , in any extension of the sm where the extra fcnc effects are described by ( [ fcnc2 ] ) and ( [ fcnc1 ] ) and , furthermore , the first term on the right - hand - side of ( [ f2dec ] ) and ( [ f1dec ] ) dominates over the others , all fcnc amplitudes have the forms @xmath58 @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 real and universal , i.e. not dependent on @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this is called effective minimal flavour violation . for clarity of the exposition we are neglecting here flavour blind cp phases@xcite .",
    "as already mentioned a supersymmetric extension of the sm with a maximal flavour symmetry ( [ u33 ] ) only broken by @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads under reasonable assumptions to effective mfv . in this case the extra terms in ( [ f2dec ] ) and ( [ f1dec ] ) are suppressed by the high degeneracy of the squarks of the first two generations relative to their mean masses . in the case of hierarchical squark masses considered here , based upon ( [ u3 ] ) ,",
    "the extra terms in ( [ f2dec ] ) and ( [ f1dec ] ) will in general only be suppressed by the heaviness of the first and second generation of squarks . from the dependence upon @xmath64 of @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the consideration of the experimental constraints on the various fcnc amplitudes",
    ", it is seen that the dominant effects to be taken under control to obtain effective mfv are :    * from @xmath57 the contribution to the `` real part '' of @xmath67 ; * from @xmath68 the contribution to the `` imaginary part '' of @xmath67",
    ".    furthermore , once these constraints are satisfied , all possible deviations from mfv in other fcnc channels are negligibly small .",
    "the precise knowledge of the mixing angles allows a neat determination of the bounds to be satisfied by the heavy squark masses to obtain effective mfv . to this end",
    "resummed qcd corrections must also be taken into account .",
    "since there is no other @xmath69 operator involving the left - handed fields @xmath70 other than @xmath71 ( with colour indices made explicit ) , one would think that the qcd corrections consist in a simple rescaling of the well known anomalous dimension of @xmath72 .",
    "this is true for the lagrangian @xmath73 , with the corresponding box diagrams in leading order only sensitive to `` low '' momenta ( of the order of the masses of the lighter squarks and of the gluino ) and for @xmath74 , generated by box diagrams sensitive only to `` high '' momenta ( of the order of the masses of the heavier squarks ) .",
    "this is however not the case of @xmath75 with the corresponding box diagrams sensitive , already in leading order , to all momenta between the low and the high scale effective lagrangian has in fact already been considered in @xcite@xcite@xcite in the context of a hierarchical spectrum , but the special problem presented by @xmath75 was missed . ] .",
    "let us deal for simplicity only with the gluino box diagrams which give , in most of the parameter space , the dominant contribution .",
    "the new ingredient that is required to deal with the heavy - light exchange in @xmath68 is the mixing between the @xmath69 operator ( [ q1 ] ) and the @xmath76 operators with two gluino external legs , for which a possible basis is @xmath77 the appropriate effective lagrangian to work with is @xmath78 it is convenient to define the scale - dependent 4-component vector @xmath79 satisfying an appropriate initial condition at @xmath80 , a mean heavy squark mass , and a renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath81 the @xmath82 matrix of anomalous dimensions , @xmath83 , receives contributions both from standard gluon exchanges as from flavour - changing light - squark exchanges .",
    "its explicit expression for a generic @xmath84 of colour is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the standard anomalous dimension of @xmath72 and : @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of light squarks ( @xmath90 , i.e. @xmath91 in our context ) .",
    "we are interested in the expression for @xmath92 at the light scale , with @xmath93 , up to first order in @xmath94 ( which makes @xmath95 irrelevant ) . to this end",
    "one has first to evolve the @xmath96 to the scale @xmath97 , which is readily done by diagonalizing the @xmath22 matrix @xmath98 , via @xmath99 . in terms of @xmath100 and of the diagonal matrix @xmath101",
    ", one has @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the first coefficient of the beta - function for @xmath104 .",
    "the rge for @xmath105 now has the form @xmath106 where the last term on the right - hand - side , upon insertion of ( [ eq : soldf1 ] ) , is a known function of @xmath97 . by standard techniques",
    "one has therefore @xmath107 with the matrix elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath108 given by @xmath109\\ ; , ~\\gamma_k = ( \\hat{\\gamma}^d_{gg})_{kk}. \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : soldf2 ] ) corresponds to the standard rescaling of @xmath72 , whereas the second term , proportional to @xmath110 is the qcd corrected contribution appearing at lowest order in @xmath68 .",
    "indeed by expanding the second term in @xmath104 one recovers the lowest order coefficient of the form @xmath111 .",
    "we are in the position to determine the lower bound that have to be satisfied by the heavy squark masses in order to give rise to effective mfv in the sense discussed in section 3 . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath112 the full expressions of the functions @xmath46 entering in ( [ fcnc2 ] ) can be found in the literature@xcite@xcite . to allow",
    "an analytic control of the final results we describe the two limiting cases :    * quasi degenerate : @xmath113 sufficiently small that an expansion in @xmath114 can be made ( and @xmath115 ) * non degenerate : @xmath116 ( or , equivalently , viceversa ) .",
    "we also take all the masses of the light particles comparable to each other and to the mass @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 from the lowest order box diagrams one obtains @xmath119 where , for the two limiting cases ( the indices @xmath120 on @xmath121 omitted in this section for brevity ) : @xmath122,\\ ] ] @xmath123,~ \\mathcal{r } = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2{\\theta_w } } \\left ( \\frac{1}{4 } -\\frac{2}{9}\\sin^2{\\theta_w}\\right)\\ ] ] similarly , for the heavy - light exchange at lowest order one has @xmath124 where @xmath125\\ ] ] @xmath126   \\label{nds}\\ ] ] both in the qd as in the nd cases we are neglecting terms vanishing as @xmath127 .    from the above equations , using the results of the previous section , the @xmath128 terms in @xmath129",
    "can be corrected to include the resummed higher - order qcd effects by computing @xmath92 .",
    "the relevant initial conditions at the heavy scale , to be used in ( [ eq : soldf2 ] ) , are :    * for the quasi degenerate case : @xmath130 * for the non degenerate case : @xmath131    @xmath92 can then be evolved down to the gev scale in a standard way , properly accounting for the different thresholds one encounters in the beta - function coefficient .     as a function of the ratio @xmath132 to obtain effective mfv . for a given light mass , @xmath133 gev , the allowed region is above the corresponding line , from @xmath134 , and in any case above the `` hh '' line , from @xmath135 , which is @xmath117 independent.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    to determine finally the lower limits on the heavy squark masses that give rise to effective mfv in the fcnc amplitudes we use the following bounds , quoted in @xcite and referred to the parametrization @xmath136 with the standard definition of the phases of the quarks @xmath42 and @xmath24 :    * @xmath137 tev , relevant to @xmath135 , which depends on the two heavy masses , @xmath138 an @xmath139 ; * @xmath140 tev , relevant to @xmath134 , which depends on the two heavy masses , @xmath138 an @xmath139 and on the light mass @xmath117 .    the lower limits implied by these bounds on @xmath139 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : bound_light - heavy ] as function of the ratio , @xmath132 , from @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",
    "given our hypotheses we would not be able to defend a too near degeneracy of the two heavy masses . for values of",
    "@xmath143 higher than 2 all the curves rapidly flatten out since the heavier mass decouples .",
    "the bound from @xmath134 is shown for three different values of @xmath117 .",
    "for any given value of @xmath117 what determines the bound on @xmath139 is the strongest between the one derived from the heavy - heavy exchange ( from @xmath135 and denoted `` hh '' in the figure ) and that arising from @xmath134 .",
    "the near equality between @xmath144 and @xmath145 implies that the bounds shown in this figure would be almost identical if the ratio between @xmath138 and @xmath139 , the masses of the first two generations of squarks , were reversed . as seen from fig.[fg : bound_light - heavy ] , in most cases the bound is dominated by the limit on @xmath134 from @xmath146 in ( [ lambda_def ] ) , which makes the qcd corrections computed in the previous section particularly relevant-[nds ] ) containing the electroweak couplings .",
    "this requires a straightforward extension of the calculation described in the previous section . ] .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , it is of interest to consider also the case in which the symmetry ( [ u3 ] ) is lowered to ( [ u12 ] ) or ( [ u123 ] ) . in this case",
    "it is no longer true that the unitary matrix @xmath28 that diagonalizes @xmath1 on the right can be transformed away without affecting the various interactions . on the contrary , in the physical basis for the various particles , the flavour changing lagrangian in ( [ lfc ] )",
    "receives the extra contribution @xmath147 with a serious loss of predictive power since @xmath28 is unknown .",
    "we nevertheless present an estimate of the dominant effects , always in the form of lower bounds on the masses of the heavy squarks in order to maintain effective mfv . to this end",
    "we define @xmath148 and , at least as a normalization , we consider @xmath149 where @xmath150 are arbitrary phases .",
    "furthermore we do not assume any special degeneracy among the squark mass parameters that respect ( [ u12 ] ) or ( [ u123 ] ) .    under these assumptions",
    "the largely dominant contribution to the fcnc amplitudes arises again in the cp violating @xmath56 channel .",
    "due to the much larger hadronic matrix elements of the left right operators @xmath151 ( with two possible contractions of the colour indices ) , by similar arguments to the ones used in section 3",
    "one easily sees that the most important effects are :    * for the symmetry ( [ u12 ] ) @xmath152 * for the symmetry ( [ u123 ] ) @xmath153    with the functions @xmath154 , not symmetric in @xmath155 , dependent upon left and right down squark masses .",
    "for all the heavy down squark masses of typical size @xmath156 , it is @xmath157 up to dimensionless coefficients of order unity , sensitive to the ratios of the squark masses .",
    "if one uses ( [ dls2 ] ) for @xmath158 , in a standard notation , and one scales down its coefficient by its diagonal anomalous dimension , ignoring mixing with @xmath159 , one obtains the lower bounds :    * for the symmetry ( [ u12 ] ) @xmath160 * for the symmetry ( [ u123 ] ) @xmath161    once again , without deviations from the assumptions made on the various parameters ( or special relations among them ) , these bounds imply effective mfv in all other fcnc amplitudes to high precision .",
    "the idea that the squarks with only a small coupling to the higgs system , i.e. the first two generations and perhaps the right handed sbottom as well , be significantly heavier than the other ones , the two stops and the left handed sbottom , has received a lot of attention for different reasons .",
    "a particular motivation has been seen in the context of the supersymmetric flavour problem , as of the supersymmetric cp problem .",
    "it is also well known , however , that solving these problems by purely raising the masses of the first two generations of squarks without further specific assumptions requires values for these masses far beyond any reasonable naturalness limit , as in fact explicitly shown in the previous section .",
    "the progress of the last decade in testing the flavour structure of the sm strengthens the motivations to reconsider this subject .",
    "this same experimental progress has brought the focus on the so called mfv .",
    "while it is clear that mfv is far from being a theory of flavour , it may nevertheless contain an element of physical reality in as much as it rests on a postulated pattern of flavour symmetry breaking . in the context of supersymmetry ,",
    "the example of @xmath162 only broken in a suitable way by @xmath0 and @xmath1 certainly offers a possible way to address the flavour problem .",
    "at the same time it is clear that @xmath162 is not compatible with hierarchical sfermions . in this paper",
    "we have shown that effective mfv can also be made compatible with hierarchical sfermions as long as the relevant flavour symmetry is @xmath163 , only suitably broken by the small @xmath1 couplings .",
    "this is the case if the heavy squark masses satisfy a definite lower bound , that we have quantified in a precise way , as summarized in fig.[fg : bound_light - heavy ] .",
    "this bound is dominated by the limit on @xmath134 from @xmath146 in ( [ lambda_def ] ) , which makes the qcd corrections computed in section [ qcdc ] particularly relevant .",
    "we are not discussing any dynamical theory capable of producing the phenomenological pattern that we are advocating .",
    "such pattern requires a coupling between the sources of flavour breaking and of supersymmetry breaking , which may at first seem difficult to realize .",
    "we think however that too little is known about these matters to consider this as a serious obstacle . at the time",
    "being it suffices to notice that the pattern we propose is centered on the special role of the top yukawa coupling and , by extension , of the full yukawa couplings for the up - type quarks , with the down yukawa coupling matrix as a small perturbation .",
    "we believe that the view presented in this paper altogether strengthens the case for hierarchical sfermions .",
    "the study of signals of flavour with supersymmetry and mfv , with or without flavour blind cp phases , is beyond the scope of this work and has in fact already received lot of attention since long time @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one point that we find useful to emphasize in this context , however , is the importance of the value of @xmath11 .",
    "most if not all the significant deviations from the sm still possible in supersymmetry with mfv , which occur in @xmath164 and in cp - violating @xmath165 amplitudes , are related to the possibility that @xmath11 acquires a large value , like @xmath166 , which has not been our concern here@xcite . on the other hand",
    "some of us have recently put forward a view that relates the hierarchical sfermions with a heavier higgs boson than in the normal minimal supersymmetric standard model@xcite .",
    "this is possible for example in `` @xmath167-susy''@xcite@xcite , i.e. in a next to minimal supersymmetric standard model with a largish value of the yukawa coupling @xmath167 between the extra singlet @xmath168 and the higgs doublets @xmath169 . in turn",
    "this requires indeed a moderate value of @xmath11 , below @xmath170 .",
    "whether or not it will ever be possible to detect relatively small flavour signals in such case with hierarchical fermions is hard to tell .",
    "definitely more likely is the earlier appearance of characteristic signals in direct production of supersymmetric particles@xcite .",
