    "2014 , in preparation ) , and the lamost stellar parameter pipeline at peking university ( lsp3 ; xiang et al .",
    "2015 ) , spectroscopic metallicities can be determined to an accuracy of about 0.1dex at good ( @xmath8 ) signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) . in spite of the high accuracy , of the hundreds of billions of galactic stars spreading over the whole sky of 4@xmath9 steradians , the number that can be spectroscopically targeted within the limiting magnitudes of the surveys , albeit",
    "now rapidly increased to order of a few millions thanks to the operation of lamost ( cui et al .",
    "2012 ) , remains to be small .",
    "for example , the sdss has hitherto spectroscopically surveyed hundreds of thousands of stars selected with a variety of algorithms in several hundred pencil beams . with 4,000 fibers , lamost has the potential to build a statically complete sample of millions of stars selected with a simple yet non - trivial algorithm ( yuan et al . 2015a ) , allowing the recovery of the underlying population for whatever class of objects that are revealed by the spectra ( e.g. , rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "even so , various selection effects have still to be properly taken into account , which is a non - trivial task .",
    "stellar colors depend mainly on star s effective temperature .",
    "however , they also vary significantly with metallicity , in particular those blue colors as most metal absorption lines are in the blue wavelength range .",
    "therefore , photometric colors have long been used to estimate stellar metallicities , for example , in the traditional uv excess method ( wallerstein 1962 ; sandage & smith 1963 ) . for fg main - sequence ( ms ) stars of the same @xmath10 color ,",
    "those of bluer @xmath11 colors have lower metallicities .",
    "the method has been extended to the sdss photometric system by ivezi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using the sdss dr6 data . in spite of successfully mapping the metallicity distribution for a complete volume - limited sample of 2 million fg stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc , the photometric metallicity estimators developed by ivezi et al .",
    "have some limitation and room of refinement : a ) the estimators are only applicable to fg stars of @xmath1 colors between 0.2  0.6mag ; b ) the calibration of [ fe / h ]  estimates yielded by the sspp has improved significantly since dr7 , particularly for those very metal - rich and very metal - poor stars ( lee et al .",

    "the artifacts at the top right corner of each panel are due to the fact that the combined @xmath32 colors of the simulated systems become redder than 1.6mag , and are thus beyond the color range that can be dealt with the method presented in the current work . due to the problems in @xmath0 color of the metallicity - dependent stellar loci at @xmath83 0.4mag , the simulated differences in [ fe / h ]",

    "about 91 , 72 , and 53 per cent of the sample stars are brighter than @xmath7 = 20.5 , 19.5 , and 18.5mag , respectively . in the calculations , we have assumed that all stars are single dwarfs . using the besancon galactic model ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) , we estimate the fraction of giant stars ( including sub - giants ) in the sample is about 4 per cent , in agreement with the estimate of juri et al .",

    "the trend is also seen in fig.9 , which plots the photometric metallicities against @xmath32 colors for stars of different magnitude ranges .",
    "fig.9 also shows that stars of different colors exhibit different metallicity distributions , largely because stars of different colors have different intrinsic luminosities and thus probe different depths .",
