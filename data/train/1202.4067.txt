    "the origin of baryon number asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe have been discussed for decades , but are still main unsolved mysteries in cosmology . no solution can be found in the standard model ( sm ) , and we must seek for something beyond sm .",
    "one good way is to consider supersymmetry ( susy ) . in susy ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is , with @xmath1 parity conservation , very stable and , in most cases , scarcely interacts with other particles .",
    "these natures make the lsp a strong candidate of the dark matter .",
    "susy could not only give a candidate of the dark matter , but also explain the origin of baryon number asymmetry .",
    "the affleck dine  ( ad ) baryogenesis is one of the promising mechanism @xcite .",
    "the ad field , carrying the baryon number , has a large vev during inflation and rotates in the potential after inflation , and the baryon number is created .",
    "it finally decays into quarks to become the baryon asymmetry of the universe . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there exist many flat directions , which consist of squarks , sleptons and higgs , thus carry the baryon number . therefore , the flat direction could be responsible for the ad field .",
    "the very attractive feature of the ad mechanism is to provide both the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe simultaneously in the context of the @xmath0-ball cosmology @xcite . during the rotation",
    ", the ad condensate may fragment into nontopological solitons , @xmath0 balls .",
    "these @xmath0 balls can be the dark matter if they are stable , while the lsp dark matter could be produced from unstable @xmath0 balls .",
    "stable @xmath0 balls form if the charge @xmath0 is large enough in the gauge - mediated susy breaking @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 balls are unstable in the gravity mediation producing the neutralino lsp @xcite , the gravitino lsp @xcite , and the axino lsp @xcite , and in the gauge mediation creating the gravitino lsp if the charge is small enough @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a model where the @xmath0 ball decays into axino lsps in gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "( similar situation in the gravity mediation was investigated in ref .",
    "the axino is a fermionic superpartner of the axion , which is introduced as a dynamical scalar field to solve the strong cp problem in quantum chromodynamics known as peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism @xcite . in our model",
    ", @xmath0 ball decays mainly into nucleons and partially into axinos directly in order to account for both the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the decay of the @xmath0 ball takes place well before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) so that the decay itself does not affect the bbn . almost throughout the process",
    ", it is kinematically prohibited to decay into the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) of mssm , whose decay may destroy light elements synthesized during the bbn .",
    "however , the mssm lsps ( mlsps ) would be produced at the very end of the @xmath0-ball decay when the charge becomes small enough to open the kinematically allowed channel to the mlsp production @xcite .",
    "this restricts some parameter space of the axino models .",
    "@xmath0 balls may decay into gravitinos in our scenario @xcite .",
    "however , the branching into the gravitino is much smaller than that of the axino because of the much stronger coupling to the axinos than to the gravitino , and we may well neglect the contribution of the gravitino abundance to the dark matter density . also notice that we assume the axion density is negligible in our scenario .",
    "this is simply achieved by setting the misalignment angle small enough .",
    "the structures of this article are as follows .",
    "after briefly reviewing the @xmath0-ball features in the gauge mediation in the next section , we show the details of the decay process of the @xmath0 ball in sec.3 . in sec.4",
    ", we obtain the baryon and the axino dark matter abundances as well as the mlsp abundance . in sec.5 , we examine the constraints on the mlsp abundance by the bbn to derive the parameters of the axion models which lead to the successful scenario .",
    "we also show the realization of those successful scenario in the @xmath0-ball parameters in that section .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec.6 . appendix is devoted to some details of the axino productions in the susy axion models which are used in the main text .",
    "the ad field @xmath2 is a combination of squarks , sleptons and higgs whose potential is flat in the susy exact limit .",
    "because of the susy breaking in gauge mediation , the flat potential is lifted such that @xmath3 below the messenger scale , while it is flat above the messenger scale , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath5 is a soft susy breaking mass and @xmath6 is related to the @xmath7 component of a gauge - singlet chiral multiplet @xmath8 in the messenger sector as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a gauge coupling constant in the standard model , and @xmath6 is allowed in the following range : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the gravitino and the reduced planck masses , respectively .",
    "when the hubble parameter becomes smaller than the curvature of the potential , the ad field begins to oscillate giving the baryon number . during the helical motion ,",
    "it transforms into @xmath0 balls .",
    "the typical charge of the formed @xmath0 ball is estimated as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the field amplitude when the oscillation begins , and @xmath16 when the oscillating field has a nearly circular orbit @xmath17 ( @xmath18 : ellipticity of the orbit ) and @xmath19 when @xmath20 .",
    "the charge @xmath0 is just the @xmath2-number , and relates to the baryon number of the @xmath0 ball as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the baryon number carried by a @xmath2 particle .",
    "for example , @xmath23 for the _ udd _ direction .",
    "the mass , the size , the rotation velocity and the field value at the center of the @xmath0 ball are related to the charge @xmath0 as @xmath24 respectively .",
    "a @xmath0-ball decay occurs when some decay particles have the same kind of charges as the @xmath0 ball and the mass of each decay particle is less than the @xmath0-ball mass per charge @xmath25 .",
    "the decay rate @xmath26 has an upper bound @xmath27@xcite : @xmath28 this saturation occurs approximately when @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the effective coupling constant by which the interaction is written as @xmath31 . on the other hand , for the weak coupling limit such as @xmath32 , the decay rate is calculated as @xcite @xmath33    here we are interested in the case where the @xmath0 ball decays into nucleons but not into mlsps .",
    "it is described by the condition @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the nucleon and mlsp masses , respectively .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0-ball charge should be @xmath37 where @xmath38    the elementary process of the @xmath0-ball decay into nucleon is squark + squark @xmath39 quark + quark via gluino exchanges and the rate of this process is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gluino mass , and @xmath42 is a possible ckm suppression factor ( @xmath43 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the effective coupling constant @xmath44 is evaluated as @xmath45 where we suppose @xmath46 .",
    "since we have @xmath47 we can see that this process is saturated and the decay rate of the @xmath0 ball is given by eq.([satdecayrate ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 balls decay at the cosmic time @xmath48 when the universe is radiation - dominated , and the cosmic temperature at the decay is estimated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the relativistic degrees of freedom at the @xmath51 and now set to be 10.75 .    next , we consider the @xmath0-ball decay into axinos .",
    "the condition for the decay into axinos is described by @xmath52 . using eq.([mq ] ) , this condition is rewritten as @xmath53 the elementary process is squark @xmath39 quark + axino whose effective coupling is given by @xcite @xmath54 which leads to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the axion decay constant as @xmath57 throughout the paper , where @xmath58 is the color anomaly of the pq symmetry . ] , and we take the coupling strength for strong interaction as @xmath59 and the gluino mass @xmath60 the decay may be saturated depending on the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath0 , contrary to the case of the gravitino dark matter @xcite . if the decay is not saturated , the branching ratio of the decay into the axinos can be calculated as @xmath62 while @xmath63 when the decay saturates . in the latter case , we set @xmath64 below for simplicity .",
    "one may wonder if the gravitinos are abundantly produced by the @xmath0-ball decay in this senario . to examine this",

    "in this section , we estimate the number densities of the baryon and the axino dark matter . we also calculate the mlsp abundance which is constrained by the bbn observation and by the upper limit of the reheating temperature which comes from the requirement that the thermally produced axinos and/or gravitinos should not be the main component of the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the analysis largely follows ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number densities of the baryon , the axino and the mlsp are expressed in terms of the ad field number density @xmath68 as @xmath69 respectively , where @xmath64 in the saturated case . from the observations ( such as the wmap observation @xcite ) , the ratio of the dark matter to baryon energy densities is @xmath70 , so @xmath71 this gives an expression for @xmath18 such that @xmath72 therefore , the orbit of the ad field is typically oblate , and we generally set @xmath73 below .",

    "the elementary process of the @xmath0-ball decay into axino is squark @xmath39 quark @xmath169 axino .",
    "the dominant part of the coupling comes from the logarithmically divergent part of the gluon - gluino-(s)quark loop term .",

    "the yield of axino from the higgsino decay is estimated as @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the higgsino degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
