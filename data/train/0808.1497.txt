    "the prediction of a relativistically invariant quantum field theory in 2 + 1 dimensions as low energy limit of a solid state system @xcite was confirmed by investigation of graphene @xcite .",
    "modification of the graphene structure may allow to obtain more general quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "since solid state systems typically have edges , the study of quantum field theories with boundaries acquired additional interest .",
    "an important tool in this context is the bulk - boundary ope . in particular , some of its singularities yield divergent observables and constitute obstructions to any experimental realization .",
    "the coefficient function of the identity in such an ope is just the corresponding vacuum expectation value in the presence of the boundary .",
    "integrated expectation values of current operators can be interpreted as measurable charge or spin currents and should remain finite in realistic systems . here",
    "we study this obstruction in the simplest case of free fermions , where vacuum expectation values can be interpreted as integrated contributions of the particles in the dirac sea .",
    "it is of course well known that such effects can prevent the lifting of a quantum mechanical system to a quantum field theory , even without the presence of a boundary . in our case the dirac sea of a single fermion yields a half - integral value of the hall conductivity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "consequently one needs an even number of fermions , though some of them may be shifted to infinite mass , which results in a chern - simons term instead . for boundary states",
    "we shall find more intricate obstructions , which depend on the numerical parameters of the boundary state .",
    "we consider spinor fields @xmath0 acted upon by the dirac operator @xmath1 on the open half plane @xmath2 , as in @xcite .",
    "this operator is a closable symmetric operator on the domain @xmath3 of smooth functions with compact support vanishing in a neighbourhood of @xmath4 .",
    "the possible boundary conditions are classified by its self - adjoint extensions .",
    "the latter can be obtained by the standard von neumann theory . here",
    "we give a modification , which is less general but better adapted to the present problem .",
    "since @xmath5 is dense in the hilbert space @xmath6 , the image of an arbitrary vector @xmath7 in the domain of a self - adjoint extension is uniquely determined by the unextended operator , so the problem is reduced to the determination of such domains .",
    "let @xmath8 be the adjoint of the unextended @xmath9 .",
    "by von neumann theory , every self - adjoint extension of @xmath9 corresponds 1 - 1 to an isometry @xmath10 between the defect spaces @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a fixed but arbitrary positive number .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 gives rise to the self - adjoint extension @xmath14 with domain @xmath15 the choice @xmath16 is standard , but we shall see that the limit of large @xmath12 allows a more direct physical interpretation . applied to ( [ dirac - op ] ) , @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 integrals over elements of the one - dimensional spaces @xmath19 where @xmath20 for @xmath21 the defect spaces consist of wave functions which become supported on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the boundary and factorize in a universal term @xmath22 and a spinor of the form @xmath23 thus isometries @xmath24 become tensor products of a unitary map @xmath25 with the map between one dimensional subspaces of @xmath26 which takes @xmath27 to @xmath28 . from ( [ extended domain ] ) we read off that any @xmath29 satisfies @xmath30 if @xmath31 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath13 , then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the self - adjoint operator @xmath34 the physical necessity of such a boundary condition can be understood as follows .",
    "consider the conserved current densities @xmath35 one needs a boundary condition which implies @xmath36 , and this indeed follows from ( [ b.c.g ] ) .",
    "we only study local boundary conditions , for which @xmath37 vanishes identically and also impose translational invariance .",
    "thus @xmath33 has to commute with @xmath38 and with multiplication by functions of @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that it is a real constant @xmath40 , and we obtain the boundary condition @xmath41 which we shall use in the sequel . to include the case @xmath42",
    ", we consider @xmath40 as an element of the projective real line , including the value @xmath43 .    for any @xmath40",
    "the hamiltonian commutes with the pt transformation @xmath44 .",
    "the space reflection @xmath45 lifts by @xmath46 to a map between systems with parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "because of this duality we only need to consider positive @xmath49 .",
    "arbitrary values of @xmath49 will only be considered at the very end of the calculation .",
    "it turns out that the results allow a continuous extension to @xmath50 , which is the case relevant for graphene .",
    "the cpt map @xmath51 relates the positive energy states for @xmath47 to the negative energy states for @xmath52 .",
    "a different type of duality is given by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , which relates boundary states of complementary half planes .",
    "the dirac operator commutes with @xmath55 and consequently with @xmath56 we denote the real eigenvalues of these hermitean operators by @xmath18 and @xmath57 .",
    "we take @xmath58 for positive @xmath57 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 for negative @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath61 of @xmath9 satisfy @xmath62 .    according to the sign of @xmath57 the spectrum of @xmath9 has two parts , which will be refered to as bulk and edge .",
    "bulk eigenfunctions @xmath63 with given @xmath64 have the form @xmath65 with constant spinors @xmath66 . the equation @xmath67 and",
    "the boundary condition reduce to @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for each @xmath70",
    "there is a unique solution up to normalization , such that for the bulk part we just recover the spectrum of the dirac operator on the whole plane , with a gap @xmath71 .",
    "we normalize these eigenfunctions with respect to the measure @xmath72 and choose phases such that    @xmath73    where @xmath74 with @xmath75    edge eigenfunctions @xcite have the form @xmath76 .",
    "we normalize them with respect to the measure @xmath77 and choose phases such that @xmath78 the equation @xmath79 yields @xmath80 and @xmath81 thus @xmath82 are one - valued functions of @xmath18 , and for any @xmath18 one has a unique edge state whenever @xmath83 and no edge state otherwise .",
    "the latter inequality restricts the possible values of @xmath84 .",
    "the limiting values for @xmath85 lie on the mass shell .",
    "when we put @xmath86 then positive energy half of the mass shell is touch for @xmath87 and the negative energy half for @xmath88 .",
    "one finds energies within the spectral gap @xmath89 of the bulk iff @xmath90 .",
    "the linear dispersion relation for the boundary equation implies that edge states travel at the fixed velocity    @xmath91 note that @xmath92 determines @xmath40 up to the replacement of @xmath40 by @xmath93 , which is the one induced by cpt .",
    "the latter transformation changes the signature @xmath94 .",
    "altogether , the boundary condition can be characterized by @xmath92 and @xmath94 , except for the fact that @xmath94 is undefined in the limiting cases @xmath95 .",
    "one observes that    1 .   for vanishing edge velocity , i.e. for @xmath96 and @xmath43 , edge states have @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , independently of @xmath18 .",
    "this case is probably unphysical , since all edge states have the same energy and the thermodynamic partition function diverges for a system of infinite width . since the width of the edge excitation increases linearly with @xmath18 , the thermodynamic properties of a system of a finite system would depend on the sample size .",
    "the edge velocity is equal to the maximal bulk velocity for the cpt invariant boundary conditions @xmath95 . these yield @xmath99 and @xmath100 independently of @xmath18 . for @xmath101",
    "there are no edge states , for @xmath102 all edge states have the same dependence on @xmath103 .",
    "this yields particular divergences , so we will tacitly exclude @xmath95 in most of the subsequent calculations .",
    "in @xmath104-space the half - line of edge states is tangent to the half - hyperboloid given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath107 . for @xmath108",
    "this happens at positive energy and for @xmath109 at negative energy .",
    "the tangency has consequences for the behaviour at large distance from the boundary , as we shall see later .",
    "the portion of edge energies within @xmath89 gives rise to an edge current parallel to the boundary , with edge - conductivity equal to ( in units of @xmath110 ) @xcite    @xmath111    this applies whenever some subinterval of the gap is actually occupied , independently of the size of this subinterval .",
    "when no boundary exists , fermi energies within the gap @xmath89 obviously yield the same theory .",
    "this means that any pair @xmath112 with @xmath113 yields a boundary state of the standard lorentz invariant free fermion theory .",
    "we want to calculate the corresponding expectation values of the current densities .",
    "the bulk contribution does not depend on the choice of @xmath114 and edge contributions for energies within @xmath89 are finite and were calculated in @xcite .",
    "thus it suffices to consider @xmath115 .",
    "the required vacuum expectation values are @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 here the variable @xmath61 in @xmath63 is the negative roots of @xmath119 .",
    "note that @xmath120 and @xmath121 vanish identically . on the other hand eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] , [ rho ] ) yield @xmath122 where @xmath123 the first term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ j2-bulk ] ) is an odd function of @xmath18 , so that its contribution to the vacuum expectation value of @xmath124 vanishes for any symmetric regularization . for the second term",
    "we also will find a partial cancelation .",
    "we substitute @xmath125 by @xmath126 , which yields for negative @xmath61 @xmath127 moreover @xmath128 here @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 the two denominators @xmath132 and @xmath133 are formally related by a reflection across the boundary , with @xmath54 .",
    "one obtains a partial fraction expansion @xmath134 with @xmath135    to regularize the momentum integrals we have to introduce a cutoff . in a solid state context",
    "the underlying physics selects a stationary lorentz frame , in which a symmetric cutoff in @xmath18 is natural . for this cutoff",
    "the @xmath136 integrals of these two terms cancel against each other due to the symmetry @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "the remaining terms are @xmath139 for a symmetric cutoff @xmath140 of the @xmath141-integration one finds @xmath142    to calculate the @xmath143 integral we need @xmath144 where the principal value of the logarithm has to be taken , so that @xmath145    to calculate the @xmath146 integral over the logarithmic part we use @xmath147 the argument of @xmath148 has branching points at @xmath149 .",
    "we may move the integration path towards the cut with branching point @xmath150 .",
    "since the discontinuity of the logarithm is @xmath151 , this yields an elementary integral .",
    "altogether we obtain @xmath152    for the contribution from the edge functions , we have according to ( [ lambda ] ) @xmath153 we have to integrate over those @xmath154 for which @xmath83 and @xmath155 .",
    "this yields @xmath156.\\ ] ] note that @xmath157 vanishes for @xmath158 and is non - singular for @xmath159 .    for @xmath109",
    "both the bulk and the edge current densities decay algebraically at large distance from the boundary . in their sum",
    "these terms cancel , an interesting effect which reflects the tangency of the edge state and bulk state manifolds in @xmath104 space , which was discussed in the previous section .    in all cases",
    "the singular part of the vacuum expectation value has the form @xmath160 remarkably , this equation is invariant under @xmath39 reflection together with @xmath161 , such that it remains true for @xmath162 and is in fact independent of @xmath49 .",
    "the regular part of the expectation value is continuous in @xmath49 and vanishes for @xmath50 . for infinite @xmath49",
    "the contribution becomes localized at the boundary and is given by the @xmath163 terms in ( [ j2bulk ] ) .",
    "it may be interesting to rederive this result from a chern - simons lagrangian .",
    "a single free fermion yields a divergent edge current on a half plane . for @xmath164 fermions with boundary conditions",
    "@xmath165 the cut - off dependent edge current vanishes for @xmath166 one still has a dipolar edge current @xmath167 which in general does not vanish .",
    "in addition there is a @xmath168 singularity , which yields an unphysical divergent particle transport in the neighborhood of the edge , unless @xmath169    since the bulk system and the boundary at @xmath4 are lorentz invariant under boosts in the @xmath39 direction , one should be able to act with lorentz transformations on the boundary conditions . in the context of relativistc quantum mechanics",
    "this is straightforward .",
    "the action on the parameters @xmath165 can be determined from eq .",
    "( 3 ) or more easily from eqs .",

    "when one moves from one - particle states to field theory , control of divergencies requires a cutoff which breaks lorentz invariance .",
    "it may or may not be restored , when this cutoff is taken to infinity .",
    "one would expect that a restoration of loretz invariance implies cpt invariance . due to the unbroken pt",
    "invariance this should yield invariance under charge conjugation and consequently an absence of net boundary currents .",
    "in our case we will find an unexpectedly subtlety , however . in terms of edge velocities and signatures",
    "the two divergency cancellation conditions can be rewritten as @xmath175 where @xmath176 for @xmath177 there is no solution , in agreement with the restriction to an even @xmath164 coming from the bulk physics . for @xmath178",
    "one needs @xmath179 , thus invariance under charge conjugation .",
    "more generally , pairs of edge states related by charge conjegation do not contribute to the breaking of lorentz invariance or to net boundary currents , as expected .",
    "there is an unexpected remainder of lorentz invariance in more general situation , however . when all @xmath180 of the remaining states have the same sign , the cancellation conditions are invariant under sufficiently small boosts which do not change the sign of edge velocities .",
    "when @xmath180 of different signs occurs , no aspect of lorentz invariance is recovered when the cutoff is removed . in any case , breaking of lorentz invariance by edge states does not seem to be an argument against the realization of such systems in solid state physics , where this invariance is only a low energy phenomenon",
    ".    it will be interesting to see to what extent the @xmath40 values can be controled experimentally .",
    "systems without time reversal invariance would be particularly interesting , but are certainly very difficult to realize ."
