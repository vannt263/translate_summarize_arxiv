    "the technique of using the broad h@xmath8 emission line to estimate the central black - hole masses of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has recently been employed widely in the literature ( eg .",
    "lacy et al .",
    "2001 , laor 2001a , wandel 1999 ) . given the ease with which the nuclear spectra of agn can be obtained , a proper calibration of line - width black - hole mass estimates has the potential to allow the study of the evolution and demographics of active supermassive black holes over a wide range in redshift .    in a previous paper ( mclure & dunlop 2001 , hereafter md01 ) we reported h@xmath8 black - hole mass estimates for a 45-object sample consisting of both seyfert galaxies and powerful ( @xmath9 ) quasars .",
    "by combining the black - hole mass estimates with host - galaxy bulge luminosities derived from full two - dimensional disc / bulge decompositions , md01 found that quasars and seyfert galaxies follow the same @xmath2 relation , a result recently confirmed by laor ( 2001a ) .",
    "furthermore , by adopting a simple inclination correction factor for the h@xmath8 line widths , md01 found that the mean m@xmath10m@xmath11 ratio in agn is a factor of @xmath12 lower than had been determined by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for nearby galaxies , in reasonable agreement with the results from recent stellar velocity dispersion studies ( eg .",
    "merritt & ferrarese 2000a ) .",
    "despite the recent attention which has been focussed on determining the black - hole masses of both active and inactive galaxies , several important problems remain to be resolved , all of which are potentially soluble .",
    "firstly , at present the usefulness of the @xmath2 relation as a black - hole mass estimator for both active and inactive galaxies is severely limited due to its large scatter ( @xmath13 dex ) . in our previous study ( md01 ) we demonstrated that much of this scatter could be due to the difficulty of accurately determining the bulge luminosities of late - type galaxies , even at @xmath14 .",
    "although the correlation between black - hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion for nearby inactive galaxies displays a much smaller scatter ( @xmath15 dex , merritt & ferrarese 2000b ) , it is still clear that a @xmath2 correlation with reduced scatter would be highly desirable , given the extreme difficulty in obtaining stellar velocity dispersions for high redshift galaxies .",
    "in this paper we investigate the possibility that the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath2 relation is substantially lower than previously reported by studying a sample of nearby inactive galaxies for which @xmath1 has been determined to high accuracy .",
    "a further complication which arises when studying the @xmath2 relation for powerful active galaxies , is the uncertainty in how best to calibrate the virial black - hole mass estimates produced by using the broad h@xmath16 line - width to trace the central gravitational potential . indeed , uncertainty about the exact geometry of the broad - line region ( blr ) in agn has the potential to produce large systematic errors in line - width based black - hole mass estimates ( see krolik 2000 for a discussion ) . in this paper",
    "we directly address this issue by adopting a flattened disc - like blr geometry , which we demonstrate to be fully consistent with presently available data .",
    "thirdly , it is currently unclear whether the @xmath3 relation is linear over a large baseline in bulge mass .",
    "although our previous study ( md01 ) found no evidence for non - linearity in the @xmath3 relation , the recent study of laor ( 2001a ) came to the opposite conclusion , finding that @xmath17 . as well as being of intrinsic interest ,",
    "the question of the linearity of the @xmath3 relation can also be used to constrain current models of combined black hole / bulge formation ( eg .",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "fourthly , the results of our hst host - galaxy study ( mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "dunlop et al . 2001 ) together with our previous h@xmath8 study ( md01 ) , and the h@xmath8 study of laor ( 2001b ) , point to an apparent division between the black - hole masses of optically selected radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars at @xmath18 . however , recent results from lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and dunlop et al .",
    "( 2001 ) both indicate that this apparent threshold is not of fundamental physical importance . in this paper",
    "we use a large sample of 72 agn , together with a sample of 20 nearby inactive galaxies with dynamic black - hole mass estimates , to systematically re - address these questions .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sample ]",
    "we describe the construction of the agn and inactive galaxy samples . in section [ model ]",
    "we briefly review the technique of estimating black - hole masses from emission - line widths , before proceeding to describe our adopted disc blr model , and then to demonstrate that it is fully consistent with recent velocity dispersion measurements for a subset of our seyfert galaxy sample . in section [ main ] the normalization and linearity of the resulting @xmath2 relation for the agn and inactive galaxy samples",
    "is investigated and compared with literature results . in this section",
    "we also compare the @xmath2 and @xmath7 relations for the inactive galaxy sample , and demonstrate that the scatter in both is virtually identical . in section [ leddsec ]",
    "we investigate the correlation between black - hole mass and the ratio of bolometric luminosity to the eddington limit for the agn sample . in section",

[",
    "cols=\"<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      as pointed out in section [ intro ] , one of the aims of this paper was to investigate the linearity of the @xmath3 relation . in our previous study ( md01 ) of a sample of 45 agn",
    "we found that @xmath23 , and therefore concluded that there was no evidence that the @xmath3 relation was non - linear .",
    "in contrast , evidence for a non - linear relation was recently found by laor ( 2001a ) . in his @xmath24band study of the black hole to bulge mass relation in a 40-object sample ( 15 pg quasars , 16 inactive galaxies and 9 seyfert galaxies ) laor found a best - fitting relation of the form : @xmath25 which is clearly apparently inconsistent with linearity .",
    "however , in order to determine the @xmath3 relation it is obviously necessary to convert the measured bulge luminosities into masses , via an adopted mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the form of this mass - to - light ratio affects the derived slope of the @xmath3 relation in the following way .",
    "if the mass - to - light ratio is parameterized as @xmath26 , then the resulting slope ( @xmath27 ) of the @xmath3 relation is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath8 is the slope of the @xmath2 relation ( eqn 5 ) .",
    "as in md01 we choose to adopt the derived @xmath29band mass - to - light ratio for the coma cluster from j@xmath30rgensen , franx & kj@xmath31rgaard ( 1996 ) , which has @xmath32 . with this mass - to - light ratio the best - fitting @xmath2 relation ( eqn [ bestfit ] ) transforms to a @xmath3 relation of the following form : @xmath33 it can immediately be seen that that there is no indication from our results that the relation is inconsistent with a linear scaling between black hole and bulge mass .    in order to calculate the bulge mass of the objects in his sample , laor ( 2001a ) adopted a @xmath24band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath34 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is significantly different from our chosen mass - to - light ratio . indeed , if laor ( 2001a ) had adopted the mass - to - light ratio used here , then his best - fit to the @xmath3 relation for his full sample would be @xmath35 , which is not formally inconsistent with linearity .",
    "however , irrespective of this , our new best - fit to the slope of the @xmath2 relation ( @xmath36 ) of our new sample , which has a larger dynamic range in @xmath1 than both the samples studied in md01 and laor ( 2001a ) , means that any disagreement about mass - to - light ratios can not now alter the conclusion that the @xmath3 relation is consistent with being linear . to demonstrate this",
    "we conclude by noting that even using the @xmath34 mass - to - light ratio adopted by laor ( 2001a ) , our best - fitting @xmath2 relation is equivalent to : @xmath37 again , completely consistent with a linear scaling .",
    "having established that the @xmath3 relation is consistent with being linear , we now assume perfect linearity in order to establish the normalization of the @xmath3 relation . with the mass - to - light ratio adopted here , a linear scaling corresponds to enforcing a slope of @xmath39 in the @xmath40 vs. @xmath41 relation . under this restriction",
    "the best - fitting relation ( dotted line in figs [ mainfig ] & 5a ) has a normalization of @xmath4 , and can clearly be seen to be an excellent representation of the data .",
    "it is noteworthy that the normalization of @xmath4 is identical to that determined by merritt & ferrarese ( 2000a ) from their velocity dispersion study of the 32 inactive galaxies in the magorrian et al .",
    "sample .",
    "the closeness of the agreement between the @xmath42 ratios determined here with those determined by merritt & ferrarese is highlighted by fig [ ratio ] , which shows a histogram of the @xmath42 distribution for our 72-object agn sample",
    ". the agn @xmath42 distribution has @xmath43 with a standard deviation of @xmath44 .",
    "this is in remarkably good agreement with the merritt & ferrarese results , which were @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the close agreement between the distribution of @xmath42 found here for the 72-object agn sample and that found by merritt & ferrarese using velocity dispersions of nearby inactive galaxies , can also be taken as further supporting evidence that the adoption of a disc model for the blr geometry is valid .",
    "finally , we note that the normalization of @xmath4 agrees very well with the predictions of recent models of coupled bulge / black hole formation at high redshift ( archibald et al .",
    "in this section we use the optical continuum information available for the agn sample to investigate how bolometric luminosity as a fraction of the eddington limit varies with black - hole mass . in order to estimate the bolometric luminosity of each agn we follow wandel , peterson & malkan ( 1998 ) and",
    "adopt @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100  . although this calibration was also found to be appropriate for the composite quasar spectrum of laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it is obviously only a rough estimate ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1998 ) and consequently we allow for a factor of 4 uncertainty when deriving the best - fitting relation .",
    "in fig [ ledd ] we plot black - hole mass against @xmath49 for the full 72-object agn sample .",
    "it can be seen that the two quantities are well correlated , with a spearman rank coefficient of @xmath50 .",
    "the best - fitting relation ( solid line ) has the following form : @xmath51 and shows clearly that the data are inconsistent with all agn having a constant eddington ratio , a conclusion which was also arrived at by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . as in fig [ mainfig ]",
    ", it is apparent that the seyfert galaxies and quasars form a continuous sequence , and that in terms of eddington ratio , there is no evidence for any systematic offset between the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that there is no evidence for a correlation within the qso sub - sample alone . indeed , given that the observed correlation is entirely dependent upon the heterogeneous seyfert galaxy sample , it should perhaps be viewed with some caution .",
    "for example , it is inevitable that objects which should occupy the top - left corner of fig [ ledd ] will be missing from our sample , since their large bulge luminosity and weak nuclear emission will have prevented them from being classified as powerful agn .",
    "however , it is not immediately obvious why there should be no members of the seyfert galaxy sample which are radiating at much closer to their eddington limit . although it is possible that the bottom - right of fig [ ledd ] could be populated by so - called narrow - line seyfert galaxies , which are thought to have intrinsically small black - hole masses and to radiate at a large fraction of their eddington limit ( eg .",
    "mathur 2000 ) , our present study does not support this .",
    "four of the objects in the seyfert galaxy sample have fwhm@xmath52 kms@xmath20 and yet do not occupy this region of the diagram .",
    "the implications of the @xmath53 relation , together with the @xmath3 relation determined in the previous section , will be explored in a forthcoming paper ( mclure , percival & dunlop , in prep ) .",
    "in this final section we investigate the relationship between black - hole mass and radio luminosity for the objects in the agn sample , to explore the role played by black - hole mass in the quasar radio - loudness dichotomy . to ensure that any connection between black - hole mass and radio power can be investigated properly it is essential that the radio - quiet and radio - loud sub - samples should be indistinguishable in terms of both redshift and optical nuclear luminosity . from the total of 53 quasars in the agn sample it has been possible to construct two sub - samples of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , numbering 23 and 26 objects respectively , which are well matched in term of redshift and optical luminosity ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the matching of the two sub - samples is confirmed by the application of the two - dimensional ks test ( peacock 1983 ) , which returns a probability of @xmath55 that the two distributions are indistinguishable in the @xmath56 plane . given that the quasars as a whole are a heterogeneous sample , this @xmath56 matching is the best that can be done to ensure that any differences in the sub - sample black - hole mass distributions should be linked to the large differences in radio power .",
    "the mean black - hole mass of the radio - quiet quasar sample is @xmath57 , with a median value of @xmath58 .",
    "the black - hole masses of the radio - loud quasar sub - sample are somewhat larger on average , with a mean of @xmath59 , and a median of @xmath60 .",
    "the suggestion from these results is that there does appear to be a tendency for the radio - loud quasars to have larger black - hole masses than their radio - quiet counterparts ( the median figures differ by nearly a factor of 2 ) , although the overlap between the two sub - samples is sufficient to ensure that the two black - hole mass distributions are not statistically distinguishable ( ks , @xmath61 ) . given that the radio - loud and radio - quiet sub - samples were deliberately chosen to be matched in terms of their nuclear optical luminosity , it is clear from eqn [ eqn2 ] that the difference in average black - hole mass between the two sub - samples must be due to differences in observed h@xmath8 fwhm .",
    "this does appear to be the case , and can be seen in fig [ matchedfig ] , which shows a plot of optical luminosity against observed fwhm for the two sub - samples . as is highlighted in fig [ matchedfig ] there is a separation around fwhm=5500 kms@xmath20 , with 11/23 rlqs having fwhm @xmath62 kms@xmath20 , while only 4/26 rqqs have fwhm@xmath62 kms@xmath20 .",
    "this difference is confirmed as being significant , with the ks test returning a probability of @xmath63 that the two fwhm distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "the difference in the fwhm distributions between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars has been previously reported at higher significance ( @xmath64 ) from the larger - scale spectrophotometric studies of corbin ( 1997 ) and boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",
    "the suggestion that the black holes of radio - loud quasars are on average more massive than their radio - quiet counterparts is consistent with the results of our recent host - galaxy study ( dunlop et al .",
    "2001 , mclure et al .",
    "1999 ) , our previous h@xmath8 line - width study ( md01 ) and the recent line - width study of the lbqs by laor ( 2001b ) . in this study , laor calculated virial black - hole mass estimates for the 87 lbqs objects with @xmath65 , finding an apparent separation between the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars at a black - hole mass of @xmath66 .",
    "however , it is important to remember that the radio - loud objects in both of these studies are predominantly optically selected .",
    "the possible weakness of using optically selected quasar samples to study the link between black - hole mass and radio power has recently been highlighted by lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in their line - width study of a virtually complete sub - sample of the fbqs , lacy et al .",
    "find that the apparent gap in the radio : black - hole mass plane is filled in by radio intermediate quasars , and that the quasar population as a whole follows a relation of the form : @xmath67 .",
    "although the black - hole masses and 5ghz radio luminosities of the radio - loud quasars analysed here are consistent with the results of lacy et al . , the large scatter around the lacy et al .",
    "relation ( 1.1 dex ) makes this somewhat inevitable .",
    "in fact , we argue elsewhere ( dunlop et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , mclure & dunlop , in prep ) that the data are more consistent with the existence of an upper and lower envelope to the radio power that can be produced by a black hole of a given mass .",
    "consequently , we argue that in order to produce a truly radio - loud agn ( @xmath68 whz@xmath20sr@xmath20 ) , the central black - hole mass must be @xmath69 and lie on the upper @xmath70 envelope ( see dunlop et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a full discussion ) .",
    "finally , we note that this picture of the radio - loudness dichotomy is in good agreement with the predictions of the merger model proposed by wilson & colbert ( 1995 ) , in which the radio - loudness of an agn is dependent on both the mass and angular momentum of the central black hole .",
    "[ matched ]",
    "new virial black - hole mass estimates have been presented for a sample of 72 agn using the fwhm of the broad h@xmath8 emission line , corrected for inclination under the assumption of a disc - like broad - line region .",
    "the form of the @xmath3 relation is investigated using reliable bulge luminosity measurements for both the agn sample and a carefully selected sample of nearby inactive galaxies with dynamical black - hole mass measurements . using the inactive nearby galaxy sample a rigorous comparison was made of the scatter around the @xmath2 and @xmath7 relations .",
    "the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows :    * for a 10-object subset of the seyfert galaxy sample it is found that the inclination predictions of a disc model blr are more consistent with the available data than the assumption of purely random broad - line velocities . * a strong correlation ( @xmath71 ) is found between bulge luminosity and black - hole mass estimated via the disc blr model . * the best - fitting @xmath2 relation to the combined sample of 72 agn and 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies is found to be consistent with a linear scaling between black hole and bulge mass ( @xmath72 ) , and to have much lower scatter than previously reported ( @xmath5 dex ) . *",
    "the best - fitting normalization of the @xmath3 relation is found to be @xmath4 , in excellent agreement with recent stellar velocity dispersion studies . * in contrast to previous reports it is found that the scatter around the @xmath2 and @xmath7 relations for the nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample are comparable , at only @xmath73 dex .",
    "* using samples matched in terms of optical luminosity , the median black - hole mass of radio - loud quasars is found to be larger by 0.27 dex than that of their radio - quiet counterparts .",
    "this difference is found to be due to a small but significant ( @xmath63 ) difference in their respective fwhm distributions .",
