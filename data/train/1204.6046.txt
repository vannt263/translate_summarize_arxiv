    "modified theories of gravity ( mg ) have received a lot of attention in recent years , primarily as a way of explaining the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . a modification of general relativity ( gr ) on large ( astrophysical ) scales is generically expected to be a scalar - tensor gravity theory , where a new scalar field couples to gravity .",
    "equivalently these can be described via a coupling of the scalar field to matter which leads to enhancements of the gravitational force .",
    "nonrelativistic matter  such as the stars , gas , and dust in galaxies  will feel this enhanced force , which in general lead to larger dynamically inferred masses .",
    "the discrepancy from gr ( or the true masses , measured via lensing ) can be up to a factor of 1/3 in @xmath0 gravity ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite )",
    ".    the enhanced gravitational force should be detectable through fifth force experiments , tests of the equivalence principle ( if the scalar coupling to matter varied with the properties of matter ) or through the orbits of planets around the sun ( will 2006 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that nonlinear screening of the scalar field , called chameleon screening , can suppress the fifth force in high density environments such as the milky way , so that solar system and lab tests can then be satisfied .",
    "this screening was originally suggested to hide the effects of a quintessence - like scalar that forms the dark energy and may couple to matter ( generically such a coupling is expected unless forbidden by a symmetry ) .",
    "hence there are reasons to expect such a screening effect to operate in either a dark energy or modified gravity scenario .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviour occurs in symmetron screening ( hinterbichler & khoury 2010 ) and the environmentally dependent dilaton ( brax et al .",
    "the screening map we present here may be applied to these mechanisms as well once the parameters of the theories are ( approximately ) matched .",
    "the logic of screening of the fifth force in scalar - tensor gravity theories implies that signatures of modified gravity will exist where gravity is weak .",
    "in particular , dwarf galaxies in low - density environments may remain unscreened as the newtonian potential @xmath1 , which determines the level of screening , is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in the milky way .",
    "hence dwarf galaxies can exhibit manifestations of modified forces in both their infall motions and internal dynamics .",
    "hui , nicolis and stubbs ( 2009 ) discuss various observational effects , in particular the fact that rotation velocities of hi gas can be enhanced .",
    "interestingly , stars can self - screen so that the stellar disk in an unscreened dwarf galaxy may have lower rotational velocity than the hi disk .",
    "jain and vanderplas ( 2011 ) study the offsets and warping of stellar disks , detectable by comparison of the morphology with the hi gas disk and through observations of rotation curves .",
    "observations in the solar system rule out the presence of mg effects in galaxy halos with masses higher than the milky way , @xmath2 . in chameleon theories ,",
    "two parameters are relevant for describing tests of gravity : the background field value @xmath3 and the strength of the coupling to matter @xmath4 ( using the notation of jain , vikram and sakstein 2012 ) .",
    "models of @xmath0 gravity have recently been worked out ( starobinsky 2007 ; hu & sawicki 2007 ) . in these models",
    "the parameter corresponding to the background field value is the present day value of the derivative of the function @xmath0 , denoted @xmath5 .",
    "milky way constraints corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "cosmological probes rule out @xmath7 ( based primarily on cluster counts , see schmidt , vikhlinin and hu 2009 and lombriser et al 2010 ; other cosmological tests are significantly weaker ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies have the potential to probe field values down to @xmath8 .",
    "tests using distance indicators also probe field values down to @xmath9 .    the tests with dwarf galaxies and nearby distance indicators rely on observations of nearby galaxies , within 100s of mpc and 10s of mpc respectively .",
    "the first step in carrying out these tests is to classify the galaxies as being screened or unscreened .",
    "the screened galaxies may be self - screened if they are sufficiently massive , or screened by virtue of being close enough to a large galaxy or group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a method to classify galaxies based on observables .",
    "we also study systematics in the observations and its effect into screening .",
    "we use n - body simulations to test and calibrate our methods .",
    "we apply the methods to galaxies in the sdss .",
    " 2 contains a description of the n - body simulations . in  3 we describe the observable properties of galaxies used to quantify the level of screening .",
    "we test two different methods to make a screening map and explore a variety of systematic errors .",
    "we apply our results to the sdss in  4 and conclude in  5 .",
    "in order to find a proper criterion to determine whether or not a given galaxy is shielded against the modification of gravity , we utilise the high - resolution @xmath10-body simulations for the @xmath0 gravity presented in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity generalises the general relativity ( gr ) by adding to the ricci scalar @xmath11 in the einstein - hilbert action a specific function @xmath0 , hence the name .",
    "if the function @xmath0 is suitably chosen , this simple extension of gr can produce accelerated expansion of the universe , and also evade the stringent solar system test thanks to the chameleon mechanism with which gr can be locally restored in high density regions .",
    "interestingly , this model predicted a different structure formation on the intermediate scales compared with the @xmath12cdm model , so it can be tested observationally ( for a review of @xmath0 gravity , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0 models may be considered representative of the chameleon mechanism , which is one of the viable screening mechanisms in modified gravity ( mg ) .",
    "others include the vainshtein , symmetron and environmentally dependent dilaton screening .",
    "we choose the @xmath0 model proposed by @xcite , and for the analysis we shall use the high - resolution @xmath10-body simulations preformed by @xcite based on the hu - sawicki model .",
    "specifically , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are free parameters .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 determines the expansion rate of the universe in this model , and @xmath17 , which is proportional to @xmath5 ( the value of @xmath18 at @xmath19 ) , dictates the structure formation .",
    "we follow @xcite to tune @xmath16 to match the expansion history in a @xmath12cdm model , and choose values for @xmath5 so that those models can evade the solar system tests . to satisfy these requirements ,",
    "we set @xmath20 and simulate four models with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 hereafter ) .",

    "the minimum particle mass is @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "we use the halo catalog , obtained by using the spherical over - density algorithm , with minimum mass set at @xmath30 to obtain reliable dynamical masses . for each realization , all the models have the same initial condition at @xmath31 , where gr is perfectly restored for these @xmath0 models .",

    "as we move from the @xmath23 to the @xmath25 model , fewer halos are unscreened  though a significant fraction still show small deviations , i.e. @xmath35 . ]",
    "to test gr using dwarf galaxies , one of the first steps is to create a 3d screening map , which can be used to determine whether a galaxy is screened or not . in this section , using n - body simulation explained in the previous section , we develop a technique to find screened and unscreened galaxies . in the simulation",
    "we can estimate the degree of screening exactly by comparing the lensing mass and dynamical mass of the dark matter halos .",
    "we use @xmath33 , the difference between the dynamical and lensing mass , defined in @xcite , to quantify the degree of screening for the simulated halos . however ,",
    "in our initial application to observational data we will use a binary classification , i.e. screened and unscreened .    in the @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the poisson equation gets modified and reads , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is newton s constant , @xmath38 is the gravitational potential ( the time - time part in the perturbed frw metric ) , @xmath39 is the perturbed ricci scalar due to mg , and @xmath40 is the perturbed total effective energy density , which contains contributions from matter and modifications to the einstein tensor due to mg .",
    "the dynamical mass @xmath41 of a halo is m_d_effdvwhere the integral is over the extension of the body .",
    "physically , the dynamical mass @xmath41 means the mass inferred from the gravitational potential felt by a test particle at @xmath42 . assuming the spherical symmetry , we can integrate the poisson equation once to obtain [ eq : m_d ] m_d(r ) d(r)/dr .",
    "we actually use eq .",
    "[ eq : m_d ] to measure the dynamical masses of halos in our simulation .",
    "note that if the gravity is modified , @xmath43 will be different from the lensing mass @xmath44 , the true mass of an object since @xmath43 includes the contribution from the scalar field , which mediates the finite - ranged fifth force within the compton wavelength .",

    "some values of @xmath33 are higher than 1/3 , due to numerical uncertainties .",
    "we are interested in a sample of galaxies within a few hundred mpc , especially low mass galaxies .",
    "observations do not allow us to estimate lensing masses for these galaxies and thus estimate @xmath33 directly .",
    "this leads us to look for an alternate method to classify screened galaxies .",
    "we can estimate the dynamical masses of galaxies using measurements of luminosities or velocities . from the mass estimate we can find their virial radius under reasonable assumptions . using the locations and dynamical masses of a reasonably complete galaxy catalog , we attempt to build a screening map using two simplified criteria as follows .    in @xmath0 gravity",
    "the chameleon effect recovers gr if @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the newtonian potential of the object ( hu & sawicki 2007 ) .",
    "this condition applies for an isolated spherical halo .",
    "we will make a simple approximation and use the same condition to determine whether an object is self - screened or environmentally screened .",
    "i.e. we look for the galaxies which satisfy the following conditions : @xmath51 the first condition describes the self - screening condition .",
    "however , low - mass galaxies may be _ environmentally _ screened ; the second condition is a simplified attempt at describing this , with @xmath52 being the newtonial potential due to the neighbor galaxies within the background compton length @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath53 for a galaxy is defined as @xmath54 where the mass @xmath55 and the virial radius @xmath56 are related via @xmath57 .",
    "here we use @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "the external potential @xmath52 is evaluated using neighbors @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the 3d distance to the neighboring galaxy with mass @xmath62 and virial radius @xmath63 , @xmath26 is the compton wavelength and @xmath5 is the model parameter defined in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the above criteria is the following : the range of the fifth force is finite , defined by the compton length @xmath26 . our test galaxy will only feel the fifth force from neighbors within a distance @xmath64 of the @xmath65-th galaxy ( which itself must not be self - screened ) .",
    "we make the _ ansatz _ that the level of environmental screening is set by @xmath52 , though an accurate treatment requires a full solution of the scalar field equations .",
    "as we increase @xmath5 , the fifth force range becomes larger .",
    "we use the n - body simulation described in the previous section to test the validity of the screening criteria of eq .",

    "we have checked that the cuts are very similar even in the presence of the systematics tested in previous figures . ]      in this section we study how systematic errors and other limitations in real surveys impact the screening methodology described above .",

    "3 .   incompleteness .",
    "somewhere between 5 - 20% of the neighboring galaxies for a typical test galaxy may be missing in our sample .    in order to study the uncertainty in galaxy halo mass ,",
    "we add a 30% gaussian error to the dynamical mass in the simulations , both for test masses ( the halo under classification ) and neighbors .",
    "the virial radius is recalculated given the new estimated mass .",
    "see top - center plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : phimassdisp ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : plotcont ] to see the effect of mass uncertainty in the screening .",
    "the dispersion increases along the mass direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phimassdisp ] ) .",
    "this implies that the contamination due to self - screening condition is larger than the contamination due to environmental screening condition .",
    "the best cuts in @xmath52 and @xmath66 are similar to the ideal case .",
    "however , the contamination increases up to 5% ( for screened galaxies ) with respect to the ideal case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plotcont ] ) .",
    "next , we study the completeness in the catalog",
    ". the incompleteness can arise in survey catalogues due to masking or by edge effects . to mimic these effects",
    "we randomly reduce the number of neighbors by 10% .",
    "this incompleteness is independent of the mass .",
    "however , since there are more low mass galaxies in the universe , most of the randomly selected galaxies are low - mass .",
    "the effects due to incompleteness can be seen on the top - right plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phimassdisp ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : plotcont ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phimassdisp ] , we see that this systematic affects mainly low massive galaxies .",
    "the contamination in screened galaxies increases by around 5% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plotcont ] ) .",
    "we also study the effect of uncertainties in distance on the classification .",
    "the distance uncertainty mainly originates from the use of redshift to estimate distances  which is affected by the peculiar velocities of the galaxies . in order to introduce this systematic in the simulation ,",
    "we add the peculiar velocity distortion @xmath91 to the @xmath92 direction as @xmath93 .",
    "this systematic affects @xmath52 , since it changes the distance .",
    "it is a very large source of systematics as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : phimassdisp ] , bottom - left , and fig .",
    "[ fig : plotcont ] .",
    "we can reduce this systematic by estimating the distance using only the 2-d projected distance for suitably selected neighbors , and assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "we use neighbor galaxies within a line - of - sight distance of 5mpc / h around the test galaxy ( or equivalently 500km / s in the measured velocity ) .",
    "this is the velocity dispersion of an intermediate cluster .",
    "the improved results are on the bottom - center plot .",
    "we also checked the result using neighbors within a line - of - sight distance of 10 and 20 mpc / h and found that the results remain the same .",
    "see bottom - left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : phimassdisp ] for a summary of all the systematics together .",
    "we also tested what happens when there is incompleteness specifically in low mass neighbor galaxies used to determine @xmath52 .",
    "not surprisingly we find that completeness is important for halo masses just below the self - screening threshold .",
    "we tested this with the @xmath24 simulations , and we expect that for the @xmath25 model this will be the principal limitation in our simulations . in conclusion",
    ", once we add systematics , the best cuts in @xmath52 and @xmath66 remain nearly the same as in the ideal case",
    ". however , the overall contamination nearly doubles compared to the ideal case .",
    "we did the same analysis for the second classification scheme based on @xmath75-@xmath66 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmassmean ] . in the upper left panel",
    "we plot the contours of mean @xmath33 for the ideal case and in the upper right panel we show the contours with all systematics together .",
    "the bottom panels show the dispersion in @xmath33 for these two cases .",
    "we see that when adding the systematics the separator between screened and unscreened sample changes significantly from the ideal case .",
    "this makes these parameters harder to calibrate to reliably classify screened and unscreened galaxies .",
    "also , the contamination is much larger than when using @xmath94 .",
    "thus in the presence of systematics the @xmath52@xmath66 is preferred .",
    "tests of gravity with a sample of galaxies requires a screening map : given the coordinates of a test galaxy , such a map would allow one to determine the level of environmental screening .",
    "we have created a screening map over about 10,000 square degrees out to a distance of 210 mpc using the sdss group catalog created by @xcite ( dr7 version ) and other surveys of galaxies and clusters .",
    "the group catalog from the sdss covers the redshift range 0.01 - 0.2 and includes close to 400,000 galaxies .",
    "we restrict our screening map to @xmath95 .",
    "yang et al find group members using the friends - of - friends algorithm and calculate the group luminosity from member galaxies brighter than a certain threshold .",
    "the group luminosity is then converted to halo mass using an interative procedure that has been carefully tested with simulations .",
    "the mass of the groups ranges from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "they estimated the scatter in the estimated mass using mock catalogs and found that it is less than @xmath98 dex .    in the sdss region ,",
    "most of the contribution in our environmental screening map comes from the @xcite groups , but we include other galaxy and cluster catalogs to determine @xmath52 .",
    "we use the group catalog from 2m++ all sky survey @xcite .",
    "there are 3984 2m++ groups of galaxies in our catalog . for local galaxies within 10 mpc",
    "we use the galaxy catalog of @xcite .",
    "these two catalogs improve our completeness for lower mass halos but not uniformly with distance .",
    "we compiled a catalog of clusters with known redshifts using archival data .",
    "our catalog mainly consists of abell @xcite and rosat @xcite bright clusters .",
    "we ignore many clusters from the abell catalog as they lack spectroscopic redshifts or lie beyond @xmath99 .",
    "our catalog has a total of 675 clusters of galaxies .",
    "a direct estimate of the masses of clusters and groups of galaxies can be found either by x - ray observation or by lensing observations . however , many of our clusters and groups do not have such an estimate .",
    "so we used established scaling relations to estimate the mass of clusters and groups .",
    "we use either the mass - luminosity relation given by @xcite or the mass - velocity dispersion relation given by @xcite to determine the mass . for the galaxies within 10 mpc we use the mass estimates given by @xcite , which covers 313 out of 451 galaxies .",

    "<S> astrophysical tests of modified modified gravity theories in the nearby universe have been emphasized recently by @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a key element of such tests is the screening mechanism whereby general relativity is restored in massive halos or high density environments like the milky way . in chameleon theories of gravity , including all @xmath0 models , </S>",
    "<S> field dwarf galaxies may be unscreened and therefore feel an extra force , as opposed to screened galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the first step to study differences between screened and unscreened galaxies is to create a 3d screening map . </S>",
    "<S> we use n - body simulations to test and calibrate simple approximations to determine the level of screening in galaxy catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> sources of systematic errors in the screening map due to observational inaccuracies are modeled and their contamination is estimated . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply our methods to create a map out to 200 mpc in the sloan digital sky survey footprint using data from the sloan survey and other sources . in two companion papers </S>",
    "<S> this map will be used to carry out new tests of gravity using distance indicators and the disks of dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also make our screening map publicly available . </S>"
