    "the dwarf galaxies of the local group offer a unique opportunity to quantify the evolution and interactions of low - mass galaxies .",
    "dwarf spheroidals were originally thought to be very similar in their metallicity and star formation histories to the galactic globular clusters , but their star formation history is now known to be more complex .",
    "the sculptor dwarf spheroidal , the first dsph discovered ( shapley 1938 ) , has a population which is predominantly old and moderately metal poor ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the presence of an extended horizontal branch ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and the detection of associated neutral hydrogen ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggest the possibility of a more complex star formation history . a metallicity spread has been inferred in sculptor from the large spread of its red giant branch ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the period distribution of rr lyrae ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity gradients have been discovered in several dwarf spheroidals ( @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite showed that the red horizontal branch ( rhb ) of sculptor is more strongly concentrated towards the centre than is the bluer population .",
    "@xcite suggest this and the detection of two bumps in the sculptor red giant branch are direct evidence for a bimodality in sculptor s metallicity distribution .",
    "@xcite find no radial gradient of the age or metallicity distribution within sculptor , whereas using the same data , @xcite find a metallicity gradient .",
    "spectroscopic studies of a few stars in the central regions confirmed a wide abundance range , over 1  dex ( @xcite ) , while first results from an extensive spectroscopic study of @xcite confirm the broad abundance distribution , with range -2.5@xmath2[fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.5 , and show that the central regions , where the rhb stars are found , also contains a significant subpopulation of stars as metal rich as -1  dex .",
    "photometric studies of the age distribution in sculptor ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) confirm that a significant metallicity gradient , with some relatively smaller age spread , are both required by the stellar colour - magnitude diagram , and are consistent with all other data .",
    "this predominately old age is puzzling , given that sculptor is apparently unique among the dsph galaxies in having associated hi .",
    "sculptor is further of interest in that it may belong to a common orbital plane with several other dsph ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present the first near - infrared photometric study of sculptor . the combination of our near - infrared data , obtained with the cambridge infrared survey instrument ( cirsi ) on the las campanas 2.5 m dupont telescope , and optical data from the eso 2.2 m wide field imager archive , has allowed us to undertake a broader waveband study of the metallicity spread in sculptor .",
    "observations and data reduction procedures are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "colour - magnitude diagrams of sculptor are compared with theoretical isochrones and globular cluster data . in section 4",
    "we present the detection of the rgb and agb bumps .",
    "the metallicity distribution function is derived in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the study of the variation of rgb and hb morphologies with radius .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the main results .",
    "photometric studies provide a valuable tool to determine internal metallicity spreads in dsph galaxies .",
    "although individual spectroscopic measurements are more precise , as yet the numbers of stars with direct spectra is small .",
    "most such photometric studies use optical photometry . the combination of optical and near - infrared data provides substantially enhanced information , reducing the effect of photometric errors , allowing colour - colour selection of sources , and providing in particular the v - k colour , which is a good indicator of the stellar effective temperature .",
    "we have obtained wide - area near - infrared j and k - band photometry of the sculptor dsph galaxy , complementing this with optical v and i - band data from the eso archive .",
    "figure [ fov ] presents the sculptor area observed , while table [ obslog ] summarises the observations .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ bumptab ]    @xcite also detected those two bumps within the central 10 , but associated the second one with the rgb bump of a more metal - poor population .",
    "indeed , the agb bump of a population of metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath3 is located at the same position on the cmd as is the rgb bump of a population of metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath4 .",
    "the v magnitude of the second bump is consistent with the value of @xmath5 used by @xcite .",
    "its clear detection can be explained by the fact that the luminosity level of the agb bump stays fairly constant with the cluster metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the agb bump being always bluer than the rgb , it explains the detection of this second bump on the blue side of the rgb by @xcite .",
    "using , as they did , a division of the giant branch into a red and blue part ( figure [ fiduc ] ) , we not only find as expected the second bump on the blue side of the giant branch , but also the rgb bump shifted by about 0.2 magnitudes ( figure [ bump]b ) , which is consistent with a variation in metallicity . if the second bump is to be due to a distinct metal - poor population , being clearly detected at all wavelengths , this second population should also show a clear imprint on the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "no such distinct second rgb can be detected ( figures [ isochrones]a . and [ ferraro ] ) .",
    "we then conclude that the second bump is the agb bump .",
    "the v magnitudes of the hb and the rgb bump are good indicators of the metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the peculiar shape of sculptor s hb however makes the determination of its mean v magnitude unreliable ( figure [ hbindex ] ) .",
    "the v magnitude of the rgb bump leads to a global metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath60.12 from the calibration of @xcite .",
    "its k@xmath7 magnitude leads to [ m / h]@xmath8 according to @xcite , while it leads to [ m / h]@xmath9 from the new calibration of @xcite .",
    "those calibrations were made using the relation of @xcite : @xmath10 = [ fe / h ] + \\log(0.638 * 10^{[\\alpha / fe]}+0.362 ) \\label{eq : sal93}\\ ] ] sculptor does not seem to present a strong enhancement of alpha - elements : @xcite measured for 5 stars the following values for [ @xmath11/fe ] : 0.18 , 0.13,0.13,-0.01 and 0.23 ( table 2 of @xcite ) . for [ @xmath11/fe]=0.13 , [ m / h]=-1.3 can be translated to [ fe / h]=-1.4 by equation [ eq : sal93 ] .",
    "it should be stressed that the indicated errors do not take into account the uncertainty in the distance modulus , estimated to be 0.08 mag in @xcite .",
    "another metallicity indicator , independent of the distance modulus and of zero point calibration errors , is the difference between the agb and rgb bump luminosities . from @xcite , with @xmath12 , we can derive [ m / h]=@xmath13 .",
    "those metallicity indicators agree with the previous comparisons of the rgb morphology with theoretical isochrones and globular clusters ( figure [ isochrones]a and figure [ ferraro ] ) .",
    "the mean fiducial of the sculptor red giant branch was computed through a least squares fit to a second order polynomial on the ( v - k@xmath7,k@xmath7 ) cmd .",
    "horizontal branch stars and foreground stars have been eliminated by selecting only the stars 0.2 magnitudes away from the mean fiducial ( figure [ fiduc ] ) .",
    "only the giant branch stars brighter than k@xmath7=18.7 and up to the rgb tip ( k@xmath7@xmath1413.8 ) have been selected . as the agb stars occupy the same location on the cmd as the most metal poor rgb population , no attempt to discard agb stars",
    "was made .",
    "we derive the metallicity distribution of those selected sculptor giant branch stars using the padova isochrones described previously .",
    "each isochrone of figure [ isochrones]a can be approximated by a second order polynomial : @xmath15 a second order polynomial regression of those coefficients as a function of the metallicity of the isochrones is obtained : @xmath16 + a_{(i,2 ) } { [ fe / h]}^2 \\label{eq : fidmet}\\ ] ] by inverting equation [ eq : fidiso ] , each point in the ( v - k@xmath7,k@xmath7 ) cmd can then be assigned an estimate of its metallicity . taking into account only the uncertainty of the accuracy on the polynomical regression of equations [ eq : fidiso ] and [ eq : fidmet ] and the photometric errors , the typical uncertainty in the resulting measurement of the metallicity of a individual star is smaller than 0.04 dex .",
    "the resulting metallicity distribution function is represented in figure [ fig : mdf ] .",
    "the secondary peak at [ fe / h]@xmath17 is an artefact due to agb stars and should be ignored .",
    "the mean metallicity obtained is [ fe / h]@xmath1 with a dispersion of 0.2 dex .",
    "this mean metallicity is in agreement with the value obtained from the rgb bump .",
    "a comparison of those metallicity estimates with the literature is given in the discussion section .",
    "since the rgb in our photometric system provides a good indicator of metallicity , we studied its variation with radius as a test of a possible metallicity gradient in sculptor .",
    "the metallicity indicators derived in the previous section have been studied as a function of radius .",
    "the central 10 arcminutes of sculptor has zero ellipticity ( @xcite ) , so as our data do not extend beyond a radius of 15 arcminutes , we use a simple circular annulus .",
    "figure [ fig : metrad ] show that no metallicity gradient is detected within our data .",
    "this gives an upper limit of 0.03 dex for the metallicity gradient within twice the core radius of sculptor .",
    "the horizontal branch of sculptor can be clearly divided into a blue ( b ) and a red ( r ) part , lying on either side of the instability strip ( v ) .",
    "the ratio of the number counts of those different parts , quantified by the hb index ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) , is dependent on the metallicity .",
    "but there is a well known ` second parameter problem ' , which could be age ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the hb index was computed from the ( v - i , v ) cmd , as illustrated in figure [ hbindex ] , for the same radial annuli as used for the rgb study .",
    "both the full eso wfi field of view data and the sub - area in common with the cirsi field of view are presented in figure [ hbrad ] .",
    "a k - s test for the hypothesis that the red and blue horizontal branch stars have the same radial distribution gives a significance level of 10@xmath18% .",
    "this confirms the hb gradient detected by @xcite and @xcite .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]    the @xcite models give theoretical isochrones that show , for an hb index between -0.5 and 0.5 and a given age , a linear relation between the hb index and the metallicity : @xmath19 \\simeq -0.34 * hbindex + cte \\label{hbmet}\\ ] ] the observed gradient in hbindex of about 0.5 then corresponds to a gradient in metallicity of 0.17 dex . considering the upper limit of 0.04 dex for a metallicity gradient derived previously from the rgb morphology",
    ", an age gradient is required to explain the observed hb gradient . as always when discussing hb morphology however , one must recall that the ` second parameter problem ' is not yet solved and that another parameter may influence the hb morphology .",
    "the simplest conclusion is that a small gradient in mean age is apparent in sculptor and that an eventual small metallicity gradient associated with it would have a too small effect on the rgb compared to the large abundance dispersion to be detected .",
    "the combination of near - infrared photometry from cirsi with optical data from the eso wfi , allowed a detailed study of the sculptor dwarf spheroidal giant branch morphology .",
    "we confirm that the broad giant branch of sculptor demonstrates an intrinsic metallicity spread ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . from our photometric study",
    "we quantify this spread into a metallicity range of @xmath20=0.75 $ ] dex .",
    "the rgb and agb bumps are detected in all the optical and near - infrared luminosity functions , excluding the substantial metal - poor contribution to sculptor s metallicity distribution proposed by @xcite .",
    "we derive a mean metallicity within two core radii in sculptor of about [ fe / h]@xmath21 from both the rgb and agb bumps magnitudes and isochrones fitting .",
    "our mean metallicity and the metallicity range are higher than those derived in @xcite from photometry of the rgb and in @xcite from rr lyrae stars : these results were summarized in the @xcite review as a mean of [ fe / h]@xmath220.1 with a spread of 0.3 dex .",
    "however our photometry is in agreement with the metallicity estimations from sculptor rr lyrae stars of @xcite and caii triplet observations of 37 stars of @xcite .",
    "it is in excellent agreement with the very recent spectroscopic survey of @xcite , whose derived metallicity distribution inside two core radii indicates a mean metallicity of @xmath23  dex , and metallicity range of about 1  dex .",
    "their data show the population structure is complex , with the more metal - poor part of the distribution function becoming dominant at radii beyond those we have studied here .",
    "we do not detect a gradient in the rgb morphology within a radius of 13 , 2.2 times the sculptor core radius . although @xcite and @xcite find a metallicity gradient in sculptor , our result is in agreement with their data .",
    "indeed figure 6 of @xcite shows that the radial distribution of blue and red rgb stars begins to differ only after 13 .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite , based on spectroscopic data , indicates that a metallicity gradient is indeed visible only beyond this radius . on the other hand",
    ", we do detect at high significance a gradient in the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite . as this can not be explained by metallicity , the most likely second parameter could be age .",
    "@xcite did not find evidence for a gradient in the main - sequence turn off , leading to an upper limit of a 2 gyr variation at constant metallicity . according to the models of @xcite a small variation in age of",
    "even a few gyr leads to a strong variation in the hb morphology .",
    "age could then still be the second parameter .",
    "moreover , [ fe / h ] and age are not the only variables which can affect the hb morphology , but also other element abundances , in particular the [ o / fe ] ratio ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite detected another population presenting a gradient in sculptor : a ` spur ' of stars extending @xmath240.7 mag above the old main sequence turn off .",
    "they conclude that it can not be explained by the presence of an intermediate age population , preferring the interpretation of the spur as a binary sequence , and speculate that it could be related to the variation of the hb morphology .",
    "no significant intermediate age population has been found in sculptor , excluding star formation within the last 5  gyr .",
    "the large metallicity spread requires extended star formation , while the evidence of low alpha - element enhancement implies extended star formation and self - enrichment over a period of at least 1  gyr : quite long enough to affect the hb morphology .",
    "the hb morphology gradient implies that the most recent star formation episode occurred in the centre of the galaxy , consistent with naive expectation that gas is more easily retained deeper in the galaxy potential well . indeed in most",
    "dwarf galaxies observed with sufficiently deep wide - field imaging , populations gradients have been found with the younger stars being more centrally concentrated ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our lack of detection of a metallicity gradient may be explained by the age - metallicity degeneracy that would hide a small age and metallicity difference and by the stronger dependence of the hb on other parameters such as the oxygen abundance , stellar rotation or binarism , as already suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all this could be consistent for sculptor with a single period of star formation extended in time for of the order of a few gyr .",
    "@xcite conclude that their study of the element abundances are consistent with a closed - box chemical evolution scenario .",
    "the small dynamical mass of dwarf spheroidals such as sculptor means that their binding energy is small compared to the energy released by several supernovae , which leads the high metallicity spread and relatively high mean metallicity derived for sculptor puzzling : how did the gas stay bound long enough to have an extended star formation and gas enrichment ?",
    "the star formation rate should be low to allow the chemical enrichment to proceed gradually .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations are trying to answer this question ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
