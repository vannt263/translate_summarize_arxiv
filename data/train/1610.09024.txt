    "the theoretical paradigm of tev - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) continues to be one of the best - motivated candidates for new physics that can be probed extensively at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "indeed , supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have already been subjected to stringent tests at the lhc , both from direct constraints such as the non - observation of superpartners to date , with limits on colored superpartners that reach well into the tev region , and constraints from the 2012 discovery @xcite of a new scalar particle that is compatible with the sm higgs boson .",
    "while the higgs mass @xmath5 gev is within the allowed range of ( perturbative ) supersymmetric models , its relatively high value requires either ( i ) large stop mixing or very heavy stops in the mssm ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or ( ii ) extended higgs sectors .",
    "together , the data has placed severe limits on the viable regions of the vast ( more than 100-dimensional ) parameter space of the mssm , largely ruling out many minimal scenarios for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .    of the possible directions to explore in susy model - building in light of the experimental bounds , the gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking framework",
    "@xcite is particularly compelling due to its lack of sensitivity to unknown uv physics as compared to the gravity mediation framework . in the context of the mssm",
    ", however , the minimal implementation of this idea , known as minimal gauge mediation , is particularly constrained by the lhc higgs measurements @xcite .",
    "the reason is that minimal gauge mediation models predict family - universal scalar masses and vanishing soft trilinear scalar parameters ( @xmath6 terms ) at the messenger scale , requiring a significant amount of renormalization group ( rg ) evolution to generate the needed stop mixing .",
    "even when this structure can be obtained , in this class of models it is generally the case that the higgs mass bound requires a very heavy superpartner spectrum that is largely inaccessible at the lhc .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to go beyond minimal gauge mediation and consider more intricate models in which the messengers have nontrivial yukawa couplings to the sm fields , as first discussed in @xcite and more recently considered in @xcite . with a standard messenger sector of some number of vectorlike pairs of @xmath7 of @xmath8 ( as typically assumed so as not to spoil the approximate gauge coupling unification of the mssm ) , there are many possible renormalizable couplings of the messengers to the matter fields , as enumerated e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the generic outcome of the presence of one or more of such couplings is that the soft terms now include two - loop contributions to the scalar masses and one - loop contributions to the @xmath6 terms that depend on the messenger yukawa couplings ( and depending on the model , there can also be one - loop contributions to the scalar masses ) .",
    "hence , while the flavor - blind structure of minimal gauge mediation is sacrificed , what has been gained is a much greater ease in accommodating the higgs mass constraints , and thus in constructing viable models of the mssm parameter space .",
    "one class of interesting models of this type is one in which the @xmath0 messenger doublets of the @xmath7 pairs couple to the sm fields in a similar way to the electroweak higgs fields @xmath9 . in such models , which are known as  flavored gauge mediation \" models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the underlying mechanism for generating the sm yukawa couplings , such as via a horizontal @xmath10 symmetry , should also play a dominant role in the structure of the messenger yukawa couplings .",
    "one immediate situation then is to address the impact of the flavor - violating contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that are a generic consequence of this model structure .",
    "models of this type can be constructed such that new contributions are consistent with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , and thus are safe from large flavor - violating effects beyond the sm . in cases",
    "in which there is not precise alignment of this type , viable models can also be constructed in which the messenger yukawas can share the same parametric suppression as the sm yukawas , which can also result in acceptably small flavor violation @xcite .",
    "while phenomenologically acceptable constructions are not guaranteed , it has been shown that the potential flavor and cp violation in this class of models is more strongly suppressed in general than indicated by naive estimates due to the special structure of the soft terms as governed by a ( softly ) broken  messenger number \" symmetry @xcite .    within the flavored gauge mediation framework ,",
    "one novel model - building direction is to consider scenarios in which the @xmath0 messenger doublets and the electroweak higgs doublets transform as multiplets under a discrete non - abelian symmetry .",
    "the idea that this discrete non - abelian symmetry is also the horizontal family symmetry that governs the sm and messenger yukawa couplings was first proposed by proposed by perez , ramond , and zhang @xcite ( hereafter referred to as  prz \" ) . in the prz approach , the field that breaks the family symmetry also breaks supersymmetry , resulting in soft supersymmetry breaking terms with a nontrivial flavor dependence that originates both from the details of the family symmetry breaking and the mixing of the higgs and messenger fields .",
    "after enumerating the constraints for generating reasonable soft supersymmetry breaking terms , prz constructed a toy two - generation model in which the non - abelian symmetry group is the @xmath1 symmetry group .",
    "this model achieves hierarchical sm yukawas and predicts that the messenger yukawas obey an inverted hierarchy ; the resulting off - diagonal flavor - violating couplings of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms can be reduced by rg effects from the messenger scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "prz s approach is striking in that it dispels the standard folklore that the unification of family symmetry breaking and supersymmetry breaking inevitably leads to excessive flavor violation .",
    "their approach also suggests new flavor model - building directions in which the higgs fields transform nontrivially under the family symmetry group .    in this paper ,",
    "we continue the exploration of the idea that the electroweak and messenger doublets are connected via a discrete non - abelian symmetry , which we also take to be @xmath1 for simplicity , and explore possibilities for constructing potentially viable models with three generations .",
    "our study deviates from the prz framework in that we consider two possibilities for the @xmath1 symmetry : ( i ) it is just a symmetry relating the higgs and messenger doublets , and hence the sm fields are @xmath1 singlets , and ( ii ) it is ( part of ) the full family symmetry that governs the sm yukawa couplings , and hence the sm fields are embedded in nontrivial @xmath1 representations .",
    "clearly , the choice made will dramatically affect the possibilities for the sm and messenger yukawa couplings , and thus the structure of the resulting soft terms .",
    "our focus will not be on constructing fully viable three - generation models of the sm and messenger yukawas , but instead on the structure of the soft terms in each case and the resulting constraints on the superpartner mass spectrum .",
    "hence , we will focus on third generation couplings , and defer a more complete study for future work .",
    "we will see immediately that in this approach , we will generally be confronted by a severe @xmath2 problem that must be addressed to have any hope of obtaining a realistic theory .",
    "the presence of a @xmath2 problem is a well - known problem in gauge mediation @xcite ( see also @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "here it is more severe than usual because of the necessity of coupling the higgs fields to the supersymmetry breaking field at the renormalizable level , since the higgs and doublet messengers are connected by the discrete non - abelian symmetry .",
    "we will show that while a minimal implementation of this framework leads inevitably to this severe @xmath2 problem , viable scenarios can be constructed when the messenger sector is enlarged to include different representations of the higgs - messenger fields with respect to the @xmath1 symmetry , such that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters can be _ separately _ tuned to acceptable values .",
    "this therefore is not a compelling solution to the @xmath2 problem of gauge mediation , but it does at least allow for the possibility of viable ( albeit tuned ) models of the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters of the mssm .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in the next section with an overview of our theoretical model - building framework , and discuss the ways in which it has similarities and differences to the prz approach .",
    "we then demonstrate how a minimal implementation of the higgs - messenger sector results in the severe @xmath2 problem just mentioned , and discuss possible resolutions of the issue . in the following section , we next present an example of an enlarged higgs - messenger field content that allows for separate adjustments of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we follow this discussion with examples of different assignments of the sm fields into representations of the @xmath1 symmetry , and discuss the resulting impact on the yukawa couplings of the sm fields to the electroweak higgs fields and the messenger fields .",
    "for each example , we investigate the phenomenology of the resulting soft supersymmetry breaking terms , and investigate patterns of superpartner mass spectra that are consistent with the 125 gev higgs mass .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss prospects future model - building directions along these lines .",
    "our framework for exploring flavored gauge mediation is as follows .",
    "we assume the presence of a discrete non - abelian symmetry that we denote by @xmath11 .",
    "the key features of @xmath11 are as follows .",
    "first , @xmath11 relates the chiral superfields that will later be identified as the electroweak higgs fields @xmath9 and the @xmath0 doublet messengers @xmath12 , in which @xmath13 , into a set of representations of @xmath11 , that we denote collectively as follows : @xmath14 in which the @xmath15 are rotation matrices that are obtained upon diagonalizing the mass matrices of the higgs / doublet messenger sector of the theory . in the above",
    ", we note that @xmath16 can either represent a single set of multiplets of @xmath11 , or it can represent a collection of them , as we will later explore in greater detail .",
    "we will take the @xmath17 triplet messengers @xmath18 , which are needed to generate gluino masses , to be @xmath11 singlets for simplicity . recall that the messenger triplets @xmath18 and messenger doublets @xmath12 together form @xmath19 vectorlike pairs of @xmath20 , @xmath21 representations of @xmath8 .",
    "second , the spontaneous breaking of @xmath11 is due at least partially to a field or fields that break supersymmetry in the hidden sector . in other words , in the supersymmetry breaking sector , which consists of superfields that develop both scalar and f - component vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , there is at least one field that has a nontrivial @xmath11 representation .",
    "we will also assume that there is a supersymmetry - breaking field @xmath22 that is a singlet with respect to @xmath11 ; we assume throughout that this field couples only to the ( @xmath23 triplet and @xmath11-singlet ) messengers @xmath18 as follows : @xmath24 such that when @xmath22 develops vacuum expectation values in the scalar and f - components @xmath25 we will later specify options for the coupling of @xmath16 to the supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "in addition , depending on the model in question , there may be other ",
    "flavon \" supermultiplets that are sm singlets charged under @xmath11 that acquire scalar vevs , but do not participate in supersymmetry breaking . these fields may be needed to generate nontrivial yukawa couplings to the matter fields , as discussed below .",
    "the role of @xmath11 for the observable sector fields other than the electroweak higgs doublets has not yet been specified . in this sector , which we presume for simplicity consists solely of the mssm matter and gauge supermultiplets , the question of whether the matter fields are also charged with respect to @xmath11 or not will be a model - building choice that will have a significant impact on the resulting mssm and messenger yukawa couplings .",
    "we will explore different options in this work .",
    "the diagonalization of the messenger - higgs sector and the identification of the electroweak higgs fields @xmath9 and the ( heavier ) messenger doublets @xmath12 , together with the mixing matrices @xmath26 , will play a critical role in the structure of the mssm and messenger yukawa couplings . in a schematic form , the superpotential couplings involving the mssm matter superfields ( in self - evident notation ) and @xmath16 of eq .",
    "( [ higgs_s3 ] ) take the form ( neglecting neutrino masses for simplicity ) : @xmath27 in which family indices have been suppressed for simplicity , and the parentheses denote contractions of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath28 represent prefactors that may either be yukawa couplings of renormalizable superpotential couplings or effective couplings originating from higher - dimensional operators .",
    "upon supersymmetry breaking and the breakdown of @xmath11 , the effective yukawa couplings of the mssm fields to the mssm higgs fields @xmath9 and to the heavy messenger doublets @xmath29 , take the form @xmath30 while the details of the relations between the mssm yukawa couplings @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the messenger yukawa couplings @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 will depend in detail on the model , the two sets of couplings are generally related and depend on various entries of the unitary matrices @xmath26 . as is well known ,",
    "messenger yukawa couplings of this type result in additional contributions to the soft terms beyond those present in minimal gauge mediation .",
    "these corrections have been computed for example in @xcite and are given for completeness in full three - family structure in appendix [ flavorcorrections ] .",
    "the messenger yukawas are not necessarily diagonal in the same basis as the mssm yukawas , such that the constraints from experimental bounds on flavor - changing processes must be considered carefully in each case .",
    "analyses of the constraints from flavor physics on certain classes of flavored gauge mediation scenarios have been presented in @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis of the question of the viability of full three - family models necessarily involves the complete modeling of the sm yukawa couplings , which we do not pursue here .",
    "instead , we consider toy scenarios , depending on ways in which the mssm matter fields are embedded within representations of the non - abelian discrete symmetry group @xmath11 , and focus on the effects on the mssm soft terms .    in this paper , we presume that the couplings between the messengers and the mssm fields as given in eq .",
    "( [ effyukawas ] ) are the _ only _ direct interactions between the sectors ( see @xcite for a classification of additional terms that can be in principle be present ) .",
    "this will generically require the presence of symmetries in addition to @xmath11 to ensure that such additional messenger - matter couplings are absent ; we leave the possibility of including them to future work .    up to this point , we have left @xmath11 unspecified .",
    "we will now consider the concrete case that @xmath37 , the permutation group on three objects .",

    "we now turn to the case of model b1 , in which the top quark yukawa coupling arises from couplings to @xmath1 doublet fields . in this scenario ,",

    "[ fig : b1lowint ] . in both cases ,",

    "charged particles are the first and second generation right - handed squarks because the corrections deflect the soft mass - squared parameters down .",
    "in either case , we see that the nlsp will likely be a long - lived right - handed slepton .",
    "the corrections from messenger matter mixing generally push the smuon and selectron below the stau and because the spectra are split , there are large corrections from the running at large @xmath111 from the @xmath112 term in the @xmath113 function .",
    "these models can be constrained by searches for charged tracks at lhc13 @xcite .",

    "the solid lines are the higgs mass , the dashed lines are the bino - like neutralino mass , the dotted contours are the lightest slepton mass , and the color is the stop mass .",
    "one interesting feature is the mass of colored particles at @xmath114 tev , heavier than the case of models a1 and a2 ( as expected ) .",
    "these models are more strongly constrained as a function of @xmath74 , with the possibility of tachyonic sleptons for large @xmath74 and low to intermediate messenger scales once the higgs mass requirement is imposed .    here",
    "we note that the messenger - matter mixing corrections split the first and second generations from the third generation at the messenger scale , and this difference is ameliorated by renormalization group running towards an ir fixed point .",
    "this  focusing \"",
    "behavior was found at low scales in @xcite because they had a larger top quark messenger coupling than what is used here .",
    "we have seen that these models allow for viable superpartner spectra while achieving @xmath115 gev . for the scenarios in which it is the third family that has nonvanishing messenger yukawa couplings ( models a1 and a2 ) , the spectra for @xmath84 are characterized by squarks and gluinos in the @xmath106 tev range and a bino - like nlsp neutralino . in the case in which it is the first and second generations that have nontrivial messenger yukawas ( model b1 ) , the squarks and gluinos are heavier ( @xmath114 tev ) , and the lightest squark is one of the first or second generation squarks .",
    "it is instructive to compare these scenarios with other representative examples of flavored gauge mediation in the literature , such as the family @xmath10 benchmark models of @xcite , all of which involve messenger yukawa couplings in the up quark sector only .",
    "these benchmark models are of course far more developed than the toy scenarios considered here , as they have a full treatment of the three - family mssm yukawa couplings and the three - family messenger yukawa couplings to the up - type quarks , which allows for reliable estimates of the flavor - mixing effects in the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar mass - squared parameters . nonetheless , the spectra of some of these benchmark examples resemble our models to some extent , for example , with the up squark or charm squark as the lightest @xmath23-charged superpartner for the non - minimal - flavor - violating cases with a nonvanishing messenger yukawa coupling only to the first or second generation up - type quarks , as in our model b1 in which there is a diagonal coupling in the first and second generation subblock .    however , one main difference is that the family @xmath10 benchmark models allow for the possibility that only one of the messenger fields couples to the up - type quarks , instead of two messenger pairs as in the scenarios considered here .",
    "this feature contributes to the fact that these benchmarks have viable spectra that reproduce the light higgs mass with significantly lighter @xmath23 charged superpartners , resulting in an improved discovery potential at the lhc . in our scenarios , the large messenger yukawa contributions to the soft scalar mass - squared parameters of the squarks result quite generally in large stop masses .",
    "furthermore , our models all include messenger yukawas in the slepton sector , which typically results in heavier / more split sleptons .",
    "another important difference between these models and our scenarios is that while they allow for the dominant one - loop contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking terms that generically arise in flavored gauge mediation , we explicitly forbid these terms through our requirement that @xmath116 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this feature was important in our scenarios for a smooth decoupling of the heavy messengers from the light electroweak higgs doublets .",
    "however , since the one - loop contributions are generically negative while the two - loop corrections are typically positive , their inclusion can also be an important factor for achieving mass spectra that are accessible at the lhc .",
    "in this paper , we have explored flavored gauge mediation models in which the electroweak higgs doublets and the @xmath0 messenger doublets are embedded in representations of a higgs - messenger discrete symmetry group , which we take for concreteness to be the discrete group @xmath1 .",
    "the idea of connecting the higgs and messenger doublets with a non - abelian discrete symmetry was first explored in a two - family context by perez , ramond , and zhang @xcite , in which they went a step further and had the same @xmath1 group also serve as a family symmetry group . in these scenarios ,",
    "the supersymmetry - breaking field is a doublet representation of @xmath1 ; the field space directions of its scalar and f - component vacuum expectation values generically must be misaligned in order to produce working models with a smooth decoupling of the light higgs fields from the heavier messenger fields .",
    "the question was whether the intriguing two - family examples of @xcite could be extended into realistic three - family scenarios .",
    "this paper represents a first step in this direction .",
    "we have shown that a model framework of this type , in which the higgs and doublet messenger fields are taken to be components of higgs - messenger fields with @xmath1 quantum numbers , generically suffers from a severe @xmath2 problem .",
    "the reason is that if there is a coupling of the doublet messengers to the supersymmetry breaking field , as is generally needed to mediate supersymmetry breaking , the @xmath1 symmetry dictates that there will also necessarily be a dangerous direct coupling of the higgs fields to the supersymmetry breaking field , which results in an incorrect @xmath2 hierarchy .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by expanding the field degrees of freedom to allow for the possibility of independently tuning @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; we achieve this here by allowing for a larger higgs - messenger sector that includes both @xmath1 doublets and @xmath1 singlets .",
    "while not a satisfactory solution to the @xmath2 problem in that it involves two fine - tunings ( that each increase for higher values of the messenger scale ) , it does allow for the construction of viable scenarios in which one pair of higgs - messenger fields is light and thus is identified as the electroweak higgs fields , while the others are heavy messenger fields that have nontrivial yukawa couplings to the mssm fields .",
    "the addition of the singlet higgs - messenger fields also allows for new possibilities for obtaining a renormalizable top quark yukawa coupling , which is also a crucial model - building ingredient .    to this end",
    ", we have constructed three model scenarios that include only third - family yukawa couplings of the mssm fields to the electroweak higgs fields .",
    "two of these models ( models a1 and a2 ) have the top quark yukawa coupling arising from the higgs - messenger singlets and differ only in their treatment of the bottom and tau yukawa couplings ; both scenarios predict third family messenger yukawa couplings of similar size and strength to the mssm yukawa couplings . in these scenarios , there is a one - loop contribution to the trilinear stop coupling , which allows for a viable prediction of the light higgs mass without ultraheavy squarks as in minimal gauge mediation . in the third scenario ( model b1 ) , the mssm fields are also charged under the @xmath1 symmetry , such that the top quark yukawa coupling has a nontrivial contribution from the higgs - messenger @xmath1 doublets . in this minimal scenario",
    "in which only the third family fermions obtain nonzero masses , the resulting messenger yukawa couplings are zero for the third family , but nonzero and diagonal in the first and second generation sector .",
    "this results in vanishing soft trilinear scalar couplings , and hence heavier stops are needed to generate the higgs mass .",
    "the spectra in all cases have squarks in @xmath117 tev range due to the large messenger corrections that arise from the effective @xmath81 structure of the messenger sector .",
    "nonetheless , we find it very encouraging that these toy scenarios , which each have a very small number of parameters , allow for a variety of viable spectra .",
    "as stated , these models represent a first step in this direction . obtaining realistic models",
    "requires that the mssm yukawa couplings are fully modelled .",
    "the question of whether the resulting correlated messenger yukawa couplings can survive stringent flavor constraints is not clear ( though it has been pointed out that the flavor - dependent couplings that generically arise in flavored gauge mediation are not as dangerous as it might naively appear  @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that this framework provides a new and potentially fruitful playground for flavor model building , depending on whether the higgs - messenger symmetry group also plays the role of a family symmetry group .",
    "there are also other fundamental questions to be addressed , such as possible connections between the @xmath1 singlet supersymmetry breaking field @xmath22 that couples to the messenger @xmath23 triplet fields and the @xmath1 doublet supersymmetry breaking field @xmath43 ( in particular , the question of a supersymmetric cp problem since these degrees of freedom are _ a priori _ independent ) , and the origin of the needed misalignment between the scalar and f - component vacuum expectation values and its connection to the @xmath2 problem .",
    "studies along these lines are underway .",
    "exploring novel model - building directions is important to ensure we are able to understand and interpret the outcome of the current unprecedented exploration of the tev scale at the lhc .",
    "flavored gauge mediation models quite generally represent a nontrivial extension of minimal gauge mediation that allows for viable mssm spectra . in this version in which the higgs and messenger doublets are connected by a discrete non - abelian symmetry , we believe that the first model - building steps taken here show promise that in a more complete implementation , this approach may provide useful input for the comprehensive lhc tests of the paradigm of tev - scale supersymmetry",

    "as a trivial example of the consistency of these results , let us consider a simplified scenario with only leptons and messengers coupling in the superpotential , with messenger yukawas that are degenerate and diagonal .",

    "we can look at the structure of the single messenger corrections @xmath147 for instance , and notice that the terms that are quadratic in the messenger yukawas will not contribute to the correction from two sets of messengers , but terms quartic in messenger couplings will have nontrivial contributions .",
