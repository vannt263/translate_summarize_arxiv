    "the analysis of the statistical distribution of fluctuations in the universe is a potent method for constraining theories or components within cosmology .",
    "in fact , the power spectrum will fully describe these variations , which are predicted by theory , if they are given by a gaussian random field .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been a great example of this principle in action with recent high precision measurements @xcite confirming that a clear and consistent picture of cosmology is emerging .",
    "it is desirable however to test this picture with additional and independent data that explores a contrasting epoch of cosmic evolution and breaks the parameter degeneracies that exist from a single probe of the early universe .",
    "a galaxy redshift survey is therefore a powerful tool in cosmology @xcite .",
    "in addition , this late - time galaxy distribution is sensitive to the emergence of dark energy ( @xcite and @xcite ) and arising through the growth of structure enables a test of gravity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the mass of the neutrino ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the structure and aim of this paper is as follows : to construct and present the angular power spectra @xmath0 of the new sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) photometric survey , along with the associated error and individual cosmological constraints .",
    "specifically , we determine the colour , redshift and angular selection functions that define the survey in section  [ sec : lrgs ] . the spherical harmonic analysis is described in section  [ sec : measurement ] and section  [ sec : powerspectrum ] .",
    "the cosmological constraints inferred and the potential systematics of the data set are discussed in section  [ sec : result ] and section  [ sec : systematics1 ] , respectively .",
    "this last section also includes a cosmological comparison of different photometric redshift methods .",
    "extended and combined _ cosmological implications _ are to be presented in a companion paper with the likelihood .",
    "the development of galaxy surveys over the past few years reflects the balance between observational technology and gains in cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "this has at present culminated in the impressive 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs - @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - @xcite ) .",
    "however , the acquisition of a vast number of precise redshifts through spectroscopy is an expensive , challenging and time consuming task .",
    "an alternative method is to use photometric redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) resulting from observations of broadband galaxy colours through a series of filters .",
    "the motivation is that a decrease in redshift accuracy is outweighed by measurements of a vast number of galaxies over a wide area of the sky , therefore encompassing a large cosmic volume .",
    "photometric redshift surveys have been shown to be competitive by @xcite and @xcite and here we follow these papers .",
    "upcoming surveys , such as the dark energy survey ( @xcite ) , are heavily based on this efficiency principle .",
    "we therefore aim to analyse the clustering of the latest and final sdss ii photometry given by data release 7 ( dr7 ) - @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 million lrg catalogue ( megaz - lrg dr7 ) is produced as an updated version of megaz - lrg @xcite .",
    "these lrgs are old red elliptical galaxies that provide a clean and consistent galaxy sample . with a stable spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and a sharp @xmath16 break",
    "they provide good photometric redshift estimates .",
    "furthermore , they are known to strongly trace the underlying mass density ; a distribution we are striving to quantify . also , being among the brightest galaxies in the universe they allow detailed studies over a large cosmic volume .",
    "this is highly desirable for a cosmological study given that it diminishes the effect of sample variance .",
    "the redshift estimates for this above sample were constructed by using the redshift output as given by annz @xcite an artificial neural network code .",
    "this empirical photometric redshift estimator learns an effective parameterisation of redshift with varying galaxy magnitudes ( here in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands ) by working on a representative training set . for our training",
    "set we use a subset of the @xmath22 spectroscopic redshifts from the 2df - sdss lrg and quasar survey ( 2slaq - @xcite ) , a @xmath23 ( declination ) stripe within the dr7 imaging area .",
    "specifically , we use @xmath24 of these objects as the training set with the rest utilised for testing . for this reason and for this specific galaxy sample over the range of redshifts of interest ( @xmath3 ) @xcite found",
    "the annz training method to have the best performance on an evaluation lrg sample compared with other redshift estimation codes , with average scatter @xmath25 and @xmath26 defined by , @xmath27 the performance of this procedure and the representative photometric - spectroscopic scatter can be seen in figure 2 of @xcite and figures 2 - 5 in @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the neural network training procedure depends on the training set being completely representative of the target galaxy sample .",
    "it is noted that by applying this 2slaq stripe to the wider photometric lrgs there is an extrapolation of the training set with sky position .",
    "the discussion of this potential systematic , however , is left to section  [ sec : systematiccodes ] .      our sdss pre - selection and secondary colour selection of galaxies",
    "is based on and described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , at the start of the 2slaq survey there was an alteration in the selection criteria used to extract the homogeneous lrg sample from the overall galaxy and object population .",
    "this is associated with the de vaucouleurs model magnitude @xmath28 and also @xmath29 , a colour cut which is related to the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 model magnitudes via , @xmath30 we prefer to act cautiously in order to analyse a galaxy sample that most represents the training set used to infer its properties .",
    "therefore , we use the colour cuts @xmath31 and @xmath32 to select and extract the lrg population given that these were the selection criteria used in the strict majority of 2slaq . again , these cuts were also used in the earlier megaz - lrg analysis @xcite .",
    "comparison with the spectroscopic 2slaq survey verifies that the pre - selection of sdss galaxies and further colour cuts from @xcite and @xcite are accurate .",
    "star - galaxy separation was also ensured using the criteria @xcite , @xmath33 @xmath34 however , the presence of m - stars still persist and represent the main source of object contamination ( @xmath35 ) within the remaining sample owing to similar broadband colours .",
    "generally , an uncorrelated sample of stars will act to suppress the power of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , one would expect a slightly correlated variation of stellar material through the galactic plane and hence our survey area .",
    "we therefore remove a large proportion of these contaminants with an extra cut in star - galaxy separation .",
    "the annz code has a star - galaxy parameter @xmath36 as an additional optional output @xcite .",
    "this uses a variety of further inputs , including angular size and gauges of the light profile throughout the object .",
    "these extra parameters are detailed in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 output parameter varies continuously from ` guaranteed ' star @xmath37 to ` certain ' galaxy @xmath38 .",
    "we remove all objects with @xmath39 , in the processes decreasing the contamination fraction to @xmath40 with minimum loss of real lrgs ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the angular selection function , which is used to determine the observable boundaries of the survey , was obtained from ` tschunk.dr7.best.par ` downloaded at ` www.sdss.org/ dr7/coverage ` .",
    "we converted the provided great circle coordinates ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) and the survey s stripe numbers to declination and right ascension before undergoing a healpix pixelisation on a sphere @xcite .",
    "we used a total of 3,145,728 pixels ( @xmath43 where @xmath44 ) over the entire sky , placing a zero in pixels corresponding to holes , gaps or regions not surveyed and a one in genuinely surveyed pixels .",
    "this discrete survey mask was then overlaid with the aforementioned lrg catalogue to leave the final galaxy map .",
    "we further tested this with @xmath45 to examine the effects of a pixelised space .",
    "after appropriately adjusting the estimated @xmath0 ( found in section  [ sec : measurement ] ) , by dividing by the square of the healpix window function @xmath46 , the pixelisation effect was found to be negligible .",
    "we imposed an additional constraint on the mask / map by excluding the survey stripes 76 , 82 and 86 , which are widely separated from the rest of the contiguous region .",
    "these segments act to increase the complexity of the survey window function and contribute relatively little extra galaxies .",
    "the resulting survey used for the primary angular power spectrum analysis spans @xmath1 @xmath47 and @xmath48 galaxies over a redshift @xmath49 .",
    "this is a @xmath50 larger area for analysis than the first and previous megaz - lrg survey ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , it is significantly more expansive than the earlier @xcite , which covering @xmath51 @xmath47 and @xmath52 represents a slightly different lrg population and analysis method .",
    "the final sky coverage is shown in figure  [ fig : sdssmask ] .",
    "the measurement of the angular power spectrum is performed by undertaking a spherical harmonic analysis @xcite . by explicitly summing the discrete galaxies over the incomplete sky we follow the derivation , methodology and/or notation of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one connects the underlying density field in a redshift band to the relevant statistical entities by first projecting the mass distribution @xmath53 .",
    "this distribution is then decomposed into a series of spherical harmonics @xmath54 and their corresponding coefficients @xmath55 ,      the statistical distribution  the angular power spectrum @xmath0is then given by the multi - realisation expectation of these @xmath55 coefficients , @xmath57 . for a full sky survey",
    "these coefficients represent an orthogonal and normalised basis and are thus found by a summation of the spherical harmonic conjugate over the galaxy catalogue ,      however , in reality one will observe a masked and therefore incomplete sky .",
    "this effectively correlates the spherical harmonic coefficients and induces the correction and adjustment for loss of power given by ,      where @xmath60 is the number of galaxies , @xmath61 is the area of the sky and the @xmath62 and @xmath63 integrals in equations  [ eq : ilm ] and [ eq : jlm ] are evaluated over the geometry of the discrete survey area . i.e. , @xmath64 for a surveyed pixel and @xmath65 for an unsurveyed pixel . the last subtracted term is a correction for the statistical distribution of shot noise and is equivalent to the expectation of the corresponding harmonic coefficient for a random unclustered sample . @xmath66",
    "one can then obtain the resulting angular power spectrum for a given multipole @xmath68 via an averaging of @xmath69 over the ( @xmath70 ) @xmath55 values , @xmath71 the angular power spectrum is independent of @xmath72 for statistical isotropy .",
    "the @xmath0 values are further averaged into bins of width @xmath73 .",
    "as seen later this has the effect of decorrelating the measurements and provides a more gaussian likelihood .",
    "we weight this average by the corresponding number of @xmath74 , @xmath75 the angular power spectrum in these @xmath76 bands is measured up to @xmath77 .",
    "one can therefore use these statistics for each redshift band within the survey volume .",
    "we measure the clustering distribution in four such photometric redshift bins , each having width @xmath78 from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "it is this expression in equation  [ eq : weightedcls ] that is presented in figure  [ fig : cl_redshift_bin_1 ] and section  [ sec : observedspectra ] .",
    "these procedures are in line with @xcite and therefore a direct megaz - lrg consistency check can be made .",
    "the aforementioned redshift bins are correlated , however , as photometric errors scatter galaxies between the bins . a small modification to the angular power spectra",
    ", @xmath81 enables a measurement where the harmonic coefficients in bin @xmath20 and bin @xmath82 have been adjusted for incomplete sky coverage as detailed above .",
    "the results are listed in section  [ sec : observedspectra ] .",
    "note there exist other analogous procedures for the analysis of galaxy clustering including , for example , quadratic estimators , maximum likelihood methods and explicit reconstructions of the power spectrum ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) ."
