    "there has long been a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas between laboratory plasma physics and plasma astrophysics .",
    "an example is the proposal by lundquist@xcite that cosmical magnetic fields are force - free,@xcite satisfying @xmath1 .",
    "woltjer showed@xcite that these force - free states are intimately related to the concept of magnetic helicity conservation and that the force - free state results from a variational principle in which the magnetic energy of a system is minimized subject to the constraint of constant magnetic helicity , which is a measure of magnetic flux twist and linkage.@xcite this idea was then used to explain the spontaneous generation of reversed magnetic fields in the reversed field pinch@xcite and the tendency of coaxial gun produced plasmas to reach the spheromak state.@xcite although _ _ taylor relaxation__@xcite as this process is now known , is not a complete and rigorous theory , it was very successful , indicating that the same fundamental physical principles govern both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the taylor argument showed that the end result of complex dynamics is a relatively simple _ relaxed _ state , but the argument sidesteps the issue of characterizing the detailed dynamical processes leading to this state .",
    "this paper describes recent experiments providing new insights into the detailed dynamical processes of magnetic helicity injection and plasma relaxation .",
    "in particular , the experiments shed light on the non - axisymmetric dynamics of spheromak formation , a subject with a long history beginning with the work of alfvn@xcite and lindberg.@xcite these experiments also show how magnetic helicity injection can lead to the formation and collimation of magnetically - driven jets in astrophysics.@xcite    an important feature of this experiment is the use of the simplest possible setup for allowing studies of the details and three - dimensional ( 3d ) dynamics of magnetic helicity injection and spheromak formation .",
    "key results include ( 1 )  observation of distinct plasma regimes depending on the parameter @xmath2 ( ratio of peak gun current to flux ) , similar to those previously found@xcite using a conventional cylindrical coaxial gun , ( 2 )  formation and axial expansion of a central plasma column from merging of plasma - filled poloidal flux tubes@xcite in a manner consistent with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models of magnetically - driven astrophysical jets,@xcite ( 3 )  clear identification of a kink instability of this central column and a kink onset threshold that is quantitatively consistent with the kruskal - shafranov limit for an ideal mhd kink,@xcite and ( 4 )  identification of the nonlinear limit of the kink instability as a poloidal flux amplification mechanism leading to spheromak formation.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ setup ] describes the experimental setup .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the experimental results .",
    "section  [ discussion ] provides a detailed discussion of the results in the context of both spheromak formation and astrophysical jets .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in order to facilitate interpretation of results , the coaxial gun design was made to be as geometrically simple as possible : a disk surrounded by a co - planar annulus ( fig .  1 ) and a bias magnetic field coil located just behind the disk ( not visible in fig .  1 ) .",
    "this experimental setup provided the additional advantage that the entire plasma formation region is in plain view so that all steps of the topological evolution could be observed .",
    "note that this setup has essentially the same magnetic topology as a star - disk system associated with magnetically - driven astrophysical jets ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the various components of the experimental setup are described in detail below .      the cylindrical vacuum chamber , shown in fig .",
    "3(top ) , is about 2  m long , 1.4  m in diameter , and constructed using 6  mm thick electro - polished stainless steel .",
    "the chamber has large windows on the side that provide a good view of the entire plasma .",
    "a key point is that the chamber size is large compared to both the coaxial gun source and the plasma , so that plasma - wall interactions are minimal during the time of interest for the results presented here .",
    "the chamber is evacuated to @xmath3  t with a cryogenic pump , and a sorption pump is used for initial pump - down from atmosphere to 100  mt so that the the entire pumping system is oil - free .",
    "the oil - free property and the minimal plasma - wall interactions resulted in plasmas that did not require a discharge cleaning protocol in order to provide clean , reproducible results .",
    "the planar magnetized coaxial gun,@xcite shown in figs .  1 and 3(bottom ) , is mounted on one end - dome of the vacuum chamber , as shown in fig .",
    "the gun consists of ( 1 )  an inner 20.3  cm diameter copper disk electrode , ( 2 )  a co - planar , coaxial outer 50.8  cm diameter copper annulus electrode , and ( 3 )  a magnetic field coil located just behind the inner electrode .",
    "the copper disk inner electrode is bolted onto the vacuum - face of a re - entrant 7.5  in .",
    "diameter stainless steel half nipple mounted on one end of an 8  in .",
    "diameter ceramic break which insulates the inner electrode from ground .",
    "the other end of the ceramic break is mounted on a 10  in .",
    "flange centered on the vacuum chamber end - dome .",
    "thus , the inner electrode is electrically floating and is connected to a capacitor bank via coaxial cables connected across the ceramic insulating break .",
    "the outer annulus electrode is mounted via copper brackets directly to the inner surface of the vacuum chamber end - dome and therefore is electrically tied to chamber ground .",
    "a 6  mm vacuum gap separates the disk and outer annulus .",
    "the experiments are characterized using the cylindrical coordinate system shown in fig .",
    "3(bottom ) ; the @xmath4 and ( @xmath5-@xmath6 ) directions will be referred to as toroidal and poloidal , respectively .",
    "the disk and annulus each have eight 6  mm diameter gas injection holes spaced equally in @xmath4 .",
    "the gas injection holes on the disk and annulus are at @xmath7 and 17.8  cm , respectively .",
    "details of gas injection are given in sec .",
    "the external bias magnetic field coil is located just behind the central disk but , because of the re - entrant geometry , is at atmosphere .",
    "the coil consists of 110 turns of # 11 insulated square magnetic wire wound on a phenolic form ( 13.0  cm inner and 18.4  cm outer diameters ) and has an inductance of 2.3  mh and resistance of 0.39  @xmath8 .",
    "contours of constant poloidal flux @xmath9 generated by the coil are shown in fig .",
    "3(bottom ) .",
    "the coaxial gun is powered by an ignitron - switched 120  @xmath10f capacitor bank rated up to 14  kv .",
    "eight 2  m long belden yk-198 low inductance coaxial cables in parallel carry power from the capacitor bank to the gun electrodes .",
    "routine operation at bank voltages of 5  kv yields peak plasma currents @xmath11  ka and gun voltages @xmath12  kv ( after breakdown ) , or peak gun power on the order of 200  mw .",
    "typical @xmath13 and @xmath14 traces are shown in fig .",
    "the external magnetic field coil is powered by a 1.4  mf , 450  v capacitor bank .",
    "the half - period of the current trace for the external coil is 10  ms and is effectively constant on the 10  @xmath10s time - scale of the experiment .",
    "the bias poloidal magnetic flux @xmath15 ( intercepting the inner gun electrode ) created by the external coil is typically 12  mwb .",
    "fast gas puffs are required in these experiments because local gas pressures on the order of 100  mt are required for breakdown .",
    "a slow or steady gas fill is intolerable because the entire vacuum chamber would rise to 100  mt which would result in a weakly ionized cold plasma and also an overloading of the cryopump .",
    "fast gas valves provide a transient , highly localized cloud of high pressure gas in front of the gun electrodes .",
    "the gas valves utilize a pulsed current in a thin pancake coil to induce image currents in an adjacent aluminum disk@xcite but also employ a plenum for measured , reproducible gas output .",
    "the disk is thus repelled from the coil , creating a transient opening for gas flow from the plenum into the vacuum chamber . restoring force on the disk",
    "is provided by a combination of the high pressure gas in the gas lines and a metal spring .",
    "calibrations indicate that each pulse injects @xmath16@xmath17 hydrogen molecules , depending on the applied voltage .",
    "optimum timing of gas valve firing is determined empirically by adjusting the valve firing time to minimize the delay between capacitor bank trigger and gas breakdown ( typically a few @xmath10s ) .",
    "one valve is used for the eight inner electrode gas injection holes , and two valves are used for the eight outer electrode holes .",
    "typical gas valve firing voltage is 600  v , with all three valves injecting on the order of @xmath17 hydrogen molecules .",
    "it was found that the amount of gas injected per pulse slowly increased throughout the day@xcite due to heating in the electrolytic capacitors@xcite powering the gas valve .",
    "a new power supply using metal film polypropylene capacitors has been constructed recently to eliminate this problem.@xcite      the images presented in this paper were taken with multiple - frame charge - coupled device ( ccd ) cameras . most of the images were taken with a cooke co.  hsfc - pro ( figs .  5 , 8 , 12 , and 14 ) .",
    "the specifications for this camera are as follows : 4 or 8 frames per shot , @xmath18 pixels per frame , 12 bits per pixel , a 10  ns minimum exposure time , and a minimum inter - frame time of 5  ns ( 250  ns ) in 4 ( 8) shot mode .",
    "other images were taken with a drs hadland imacon 200 ( fig .",
    "11 ) , which has 8 or 16 frames per shot , @xmath19 pixels per frame , 10 bits per pixel , a minimum 10  ns exposure time , and a minimum of 5  ns ( 250  ns ) inter - frame time in 8 ( 16 ) shot mode .",
    "the camera is placed on a tripod and positioned in front of the right - most vacuum chamber window shown in fig .",
    "3(top ) .",
    "magnetic field data are taken with a radial array of small pickup coils mounted on a stainless steel shaft , which can be scanned in @xmath6 and rotated in @xmath4 .",
    "the array contains twenty groups of three coils arranged so that all three components of @xmath20 are measured from @xmath21 to @xmath22  cm with 2  cm resolution .",
    "the coils are commercial chip inductors ( coil craft 1008cs-472xgbb ) and have calibrated turns @xmath23 area @xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "the coils are placed into precision - machined slots of a long thin strip of delrin , which in turn is slid down a thin - wall stainless steel tube covered by an alumina tube to prevent metal contact with the plasma ( see fig",
    "the alumina has an outer diameter of 8.4  mm .",
    "the frequency response , limited by the skin effect of the stainless steel tube , is good up to 1  mhz .",
    "further details of probe design , construction , calibration , as well as probe improvements since this work are reported elsewhere.@xcite    a rogowski coil placed around the ceramic break , which is connected to the inner electrode , measures total @xmath13 .",
    "the rogowski coil was hand - wound with a calibrated @xmath26  m@xmath27 , and the signal is integrated via a passive integrator with @xmath28  ms .",
    "an attenuating tektronix p6015 high voltage probe measures @xmath14 .",
    "triggering of the various power supplies ( bias coil , gas valves , and coaxial gun ) , the data acquisition system , and the camera is provided by a programmable 12-channel sequencer with fiber optic outputs .",
    "a typical trigger sequence is as follows : ( 1 )  the bias coil is fired at @xmath29  ms ( due to its @xmath30  ms rise - time ) , ( 2 )  the gas valves are fired at @xmath31  ms ( to accommodate the @xmath32  ms travel time of neutral gas through the gas lines into the plasma formation region ) , and ( 3 )  the main capacitor bank ignitrons are triggered at @xmath33 with gas breakdown typically occuring at @xmath34  @xmath10s .",
    "the digital data acquisition system is a 64-channel vme ( versa module europa ) system from struck innovative systems .",
    "each channel has a sampling rate of 105  mhz , a 12-bit resolution , 50  @xmath8 input impedance , 32  kb memory , and an input range of -512 to 512  mv with continuously adjustable offset .",
    "all magnetic probe and gun diagnostic signals are digitized on this system .",
    "the digital acquisition system is controlled and the data is displayed and analyzed using interactive data language ( idl ) routines .",
    "the magnetic probe array signals are integrated numerically .",
    "the plasmas produced by the coaxial gun have the following nominal global parameters : @xmath35  @xmath36,@xcite @xmath3715  ev , and @xmath381  kg .",
    "the global plasma length scale @xmath39 is approximately 25  cm , and the typical ion gyroradius is @xmath40  cm .",
    "the characteristic alfvn  transit time is @xmath41  @xmath10s ; plasma lifetime is about 15  @xmath10s ; resistive diffusion time is on the order of 1  ms . the lundquist number @xmath42@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the alfvn  speed and @xmath45 is the classical resistivity .",
    "thus , the 15  @xmath10s duration plasma dynamics lasts several alfvn  times , and the magnetic flux is reasonably frozen into the plasma .",
    "the paschen condition for gas breakdown@xcite shows that the voltage required for gas breakdown between two electrodes separated by distance @xmath46 depends on the product @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the pressure in the region between electrodes .",
    "the dependence is such that the breakdown voltage becomes infinite when the @xmath47 product becomes less than about half the value at which the breakdown voltage is minimum .",
    "this property is exploited using a fast , localized gas injection , as shown in fig .",
    "3(bottom ) .",
    "the gas valve operation is adjusted so that @xmath47 satisfies the paschen condition along the bias field lines .",
    "because of the 6  mm size of the inter - electrode gap and the negligible gas pressure in the gap , the @xmath47 value in the gap is so small as to be well to the left of the paschen minimum such that breakdown can not occur there .",
    "this setup demonstrates the counter - intuitive fact that a very small distance between conductors in vacuum can provide perfect electrical insulation.@xcite this fact was also utilized in the caltech solar prominence experimental setup.@xcite    breakdown along the bias field lines is shown in frame  1 of fig .  5 , which is a ccd camera image of the plasma within approximately the first microsecond after breakdown .",
    "the electrodes are located in the right hand side of each frame ; the circular gap between electrodes is identified by an arrow .",
    "the locations of the eight bright legs correspond to the locations of the eight pairs of gas injection holes , and the shape of the legs matches the calculated bias field configuration .",
    "these observations indicate that breakdown is occurring along the bias field lines and that the gas pressure is non - uniform and concentrated azimuthally at the eight @xmath4 positions corresponding to the gas injection holes .",
    "the breakdown occurs approximately 45  @xmath10s after high - voltage is applied ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . in order to minimize jitter and maximize reproducibility ,",
    "the gas injection timing was adjusted to minimize the time delay before breakdown .",
    "the gun current ramps up steeply during the next 10  @xmath10s ( see fig .  4 ) , and the eight bright legs expand and merge , as shown in the next two frames of fig .",
    "the rising gun current corresponds to an increase in toroidal magnetic flux linking the bias field lines , and therefore magnetic helicity is injected at the rate @xmath49.@xcite the applied gun voltage creates a radial electric field . from the radial component of the ideal ohm s law , @xmath50",
    "it is seen that a combination of toroidal rotation @xmath51 and axial flow @xmath52 will arise to balance @xmath53 .",
    "note that an astrophysical accretion disk is similar to a coaxial gun but with the driving term coming from the keplerian disk rotation @xmath51 which gives rise to @xmath53.@xcite as described below , further evolution of the plasma after frame  3 of fig .",
    "5 is dependent on the peak value of @xmath54 .",
    "after the initial formation stage , the plasma can evolve into three distinct morphologies depending on peak @xmath2.@xcite similar regimes were also observed in previous caltech experiments using a conventional cylindrical coaxial gun.@xcite the parameter @xmath2 can be thought of as a boundary condition imposed on the plasma at the gun surface .",
    "its functional form @xmath55 can be easily derived by integrating @xmath56 over the inner gun electrode surface .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is varied experimentally by adjusting the main capacitor bank voltage ( which controls @xmath13 ) and the bias coil bank voltage ( which controls @xmath15 ) . a plot of @xmath2 parameter space is shown in fig .  6 , with the different observed plasma morphologies ( i , ii , iii ) indicated .",
    "the formation of a central plasma column along the @xmath6 direction is observed for values of @xmath58  m@xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . magnetic probe measurements in this regime ( fig .  7 ) show that the column has magnetic field radial profiles resembling a screw pinch .",
    "the axial expansion of the column is derived from fig .",
    "5 to be approximately 40  km / s which is of the order of the alfvn  speed .",
    "the filamentary shape of this column provides compelling experimental evidence for magnetically - driven models of astrophysical jet collimation,@xcite in which an ionized rotating accretion disk winds up a background magnetic field and injects magnetic helicity into the disk corona .      for @xmath60  m@xmath61  m@xmath59 , the plasma column forms along the @xmath6 direction but then develops a helical instability with toroidal mode number @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "the helical instability is shown to be consistent with an ideal mhd kink instability by two independent experimental measurements described below .",
    "the kruskal - shafranov condition for mhd kink instability in cylindrical geometry is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the safety factor and @xmath64 and @xmath39 are the column radius and length , respectively . by invoking the relationships @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the kruskal - shafranov condition for kink instability",
    "can be expressed as@xcite @xmath67 thus , the experimentally observed instability onset can be compared to the kruskal - shafranov condition by knowing only @xmath2 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure  9 shows a scatter plot of @xmath2 versus @xmath39 for an ensemble of shots in which a plasma column forms .",
    "the data points represent both different shots and different times within the same shot ( _ i.e. _ , before and after the instability occurs ) .",
    "it is seen that the threshold for the appearance of the helical instability is in good agreement with the kruskal - shafranov limit ( dashed line in fig .",
    "consistency with the kruskal - shafranov limit was also checked with direct magnetic probe measurements .",
    "radial profiles of @xmath68 and @xmath69 yielded @xmath63 profiles as a function of time , as shown in fig .",
    "it is shown that @xmath63 drops to unity around 10.5  @xmath10s . the corresponding image sequence for this shot , shown in fig .",
    "11 , indicates that the helical instability develops at this same time .",
    "thus the observed helical instability is consistent with an ideal kink , with onset occurring when @xmath63 drops to unity .",
    "the @xmath63 is initially greater than unity because the bias poloidal flux dominates and @xmath39 is small .",
    "then @xmath39 increases quickly and @xmath70 also increases to a lesser degree , and therefore @xmath63 drops according to eq .",
    "( [ ks - condition ] ) .",
    "the growth of the kink mode was captured by shortening the inter - frame time of the ccd camera to 0.25  @xmath10s ( see fig .",
    "the mode amplitude as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "13 and is seen to exhibit a fairly linear growth rate .      at values of @xmath71  m@xmath59",
    ", the plasma appears to `` pinch - off '' without the formation of a central column , as shown in fig .",
    "14 . from the image sequence",
    ", the propagation velocity of the detached plasma along the @xmath6-axis is calculated to be around 50  km / s ( of the order of the alfvn  speed ) .",
    "magnetic probe measurements indicate that the detached plasma has much stronger toroidal than poloidal field ( fig .",
    "it is possible that this toroidal - flux - rich detached plasma will relax to a spheromak configuration with equivalent toroidal and poloidal flux .",
    "poloidal flux amplification , as measured by the magnetic probe array , is large in this regime .",
    "flux amplification for all three regimes is shown in fig .",
    "16 as a function of peak @xmath2 . in the kinked regime ,",
    "the flux amplification is typically around a factor of two , and the flux amplification mechanism in this regime ( discussed below ) has been identified .",
    "the flux amplification is neligible in the low @xmath2 regime , but it is very large in the high @xmath2 regime",
    ". the mechanism for the high @xmath2 regime is not known , but it is probably related to the mechanism operating in the kink regime . an interesting question requiring further study is what determintes the maximum amount of flux amplification .",
    "the next section shows that the kink is a mechanism for poloidal flux amplification and spheromak formation .",
    "the kink instability is identified experimentally as a mechanism for ( 1 )  poloidal flux amplification and ( 2 )  spheromak formation.@xcite both are experimentally observed immediately following kinking of the central column .",
    "this can be seen by examining the evolution of poloidal flux contours and maximum @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "17 ) calculated from time - resolved magnetic probe data and the sequence of ccd images showing the kink ( fig .",
    "11 ) .",
    "the kink modifies the direction of current flow from purely @xmath6 ( poloidal ) to a partially @xmath4 ( toroidal ) direction .",
    "consequently , it converts toroidal to poloidal flux .",
    "this process is paramagnetic , amplifying @xmath9 over the initial applied @xmath72  mwb .",
    "the paramagnetism is understood by realizing that kinks involve perturbations with dependence @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "the latter means @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the trajectory of the kink is determined by considering a locus of constant phase of the perturbation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 thus , substituting eq .",
    "( [ kz ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) gives the coordinates of the helix , @xmath79 , from which it can be seen that the kinked current channel is a right - handed helix if @xmath80 and a left - handed helix if @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the helix will always have the form of a solenoid with the appropriate handedness to amplify the original @xmath68 .",
    "the additional @xmath9 introduced by the kink can be estimated by considering the helically deformed current channel to be a solenoid with current @xmath82 , turns per length @xmath83 , and radius @xmath64 .",
    "the solenoid formula for the field inside the solenoid is @xmath84 ; the @xmath9 produced by the solenoid is @xmath85 and thus depends non - linearly on the kink amplitude @xmath64 . using the measured values @xmath86  cm , @xmath87  cm , and @xmath88  ka at 13.5  @xmath10s",
    ", the @xmath9 generated by the kink is predicted to be approximately 1  mwb , which is within a factor of 2 of the observed amplification of @xmath89 over @xmath15 .",
    "the discrepancy is within the accuracy of @xmath64 and @xmath39 measurements and of the @xmath9 calculation assuming axisymmetry in the presence of the rotating kink .",
    "because the coaxial gun injects only toroidal flux , 3d plasma dynamics must be responsible for @xmath9 exceeding @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamics are provided by the kink , which is the mechanism by which toroidal flux is converted to poloidal flux .",
    "the appearance of the kink is followed immediately by three signatures of spheromak formation : ( 1 )  appearance of closed @xmath9-contours [ calculated assuming axisymmetry , @xmath90 , ( 2 )  @xmath9-amplification , and ( 3 )  magnetic field radial profiles consistent with spheromak formation .",
    "it is important to note that the relationship between closed @xmath9-contours and closed flux surfaces becomes ambiguous when axisymmetry is broken .",
    "thus , in the presence of a non - axisymmetric kink , closed @xmath9-contours indicate closed flux surfaces only in a time - averaged manner . shortly after 13  @xmath10s ,",
    "the kink breaks apart ( fig .",
    "this coincides with signatures of spheromak formation as observed in the magnetic probe measurements ( fig .",
    "17 ) . at approximately 13  @xmath10s , closed @xmath9-contours appear and @xmath89 is amplified to larger than @xmath15 ( @xmath9-amplification is due mainly to broadening of the @xmath68 profile after 12  @xmath10s ) . at 15  @xmath10s , magnetic field profiles consistent with spheromak formation are observed ( fig .",
    ". the measured radial profiles of @xmath68 and @xmath91 at 15  @xmath10s are compared with taylor state solutions@xcite in cylindrical geometry , _ i.e. _  uniform @xmath92 solutions of @xmath93 the solutions are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are bessel functions of order zero and one , respectively , and the best fit is found for @xmath98  m@xmath59 with a radial offset of 4  cm ( displacement of spheromak off the geometric axis ) .",
    "the slight disagreement between measured profiles and the taylor solution is not surprising since the spheromak is expected to be either ( 1 )  still undergoing relaxation toward the taylor state or ( 2 )  in a modified relaxed state since it is still being driven by the gun , where peak @xmath99  m@xmath59 .",
    "spheromak formation involves a sequence of steps that in principle should be possible to visualize mentally .",
    "however , the inherent geometric and topological complexity of these steps has made such a visualization so challenging that no consensus exists on the precise form of this sequence .",
    "this shortcoming is important because without being able to visualize how the 3d topology evolves during the spheromak formation sequence , it is difficult to optimize this process and the closely related sustainment process.@xcite because visualization of the process has proved difficult , the main appoach used to date for experimentally characterizing spheromak formation and sustainment is modal analysis , a method where fourier modes are first identified and then the time dependence and spatial profile of these modes are measured and compared with theoretical models . while useful in many respects , modal analysis gives little insight into 3d topological issues such as linkage , connectivity , knottedness , and conversion between toroidal flux and poloidal flux .",
    "the photographs of evolving magnetized plasmas in the present experiments have provided an actual visualization which helps provide new insights into these issues .",
    "new interpretations are given here and placed into context with respect to past experimental work.@xcite it should also be noted that many aspects of the present work are qualitatively similar to recent time - dependent mhd simulations of spheromak formation via electrostatic helicity injection.@xcite    bounded , axisymmetric , force - free plasma equilibria were first discussed in the 1950s.@xcite these theoretical models invoked rather abstract astrophysical contexts and did not contain descriptions of the detailed processes by which such equilibria could be created . a hypothetical analogy to this situation would be to be in possesion of an abstract theoretical model demonstrating that soap bubbles should in principle exist , while never having observed a soap bubble nor being aware of how to blow soap bubbles .",
    "the soap bubble analogy is apt because a bounded , axisymmetric , force - free equilibrium can be thought of as being a bubble ( local maximum ) of poloidal flux @xmath100 .",
    "first derivatives ( gradients ) of @xmath9 show that a local @xmath100 maximum constitutes a magnetic axis , and second derivatives ( laplacian - like operators ) of @xmath9 show that a toroidal current necessarily flows along this magnetic axis .    lacking detailed knowledge for how to make these `` magnetic bubbles ''",
    "is a non - trivial shortcoming because cowling s anti - dynamo theorem@xcite shows that there is no simple way to make such @xmath9 bubbles .",
    "specifically , cowling showed that creation / sustainment of an axisymmetric , steady - state toroidal current can not be achieved via axisymmetric ( _ i.e. _ , simple ) means .",
    "since creation of an axisymmetric toroidal current is tantamount to creating a local @xmath100 maximum , the cowling anti - dynamo theorem effectively requires that any poloidal flux amplification process must be non - axisymmetric .",
    "thus , spheromak formation and sustainment necessarily involve non - axisymmetric processes .",
    "helical ( _ i.e. _ , non - axisymmetric ) distortions of magnetized coaxial gun central columns and associated poloidal flux amplification were first observed in the early 1960 s in experiments by alfven et al.@xcite and lindberg et al.@xcite it is interesting to note that these early magnetized coaxial gun experiments revealed phenomena relating to spheromak formation nearly two decades before the word `` spheromak '' was coined by rosenbluth and bussac.@xcite in particular , lindberg et al.@xcite imaged the helical instability of an initially azimuthally symmetric axial current channel , characterized this as an `` @xmath101 instability , '' noted that `` such instabilities are well known in the theories of pinches , '' and measured an amplification of the poloidal flux .",
    "lindberg et al .  interpreted this central column helix as a kink instability of the _ geometric axis _",
    "current and postulated that the helical deformation of the current path was responsible for observed poloidal flux amplification .",
    "however , lindberg et al .  did not provide quantitative measurements establishing that the observed helical instability was indeed a kink ( _ i.e. _ , that the configuration destabilized when the @xmath102 kink stability threshold was crossed ) nor that the instability produced a magnitude and polarity of poloidal flux consistent with observation .",
    "similar modes ( now called @xmath0 modes ) were also observed in all later coaxial gun experiments,@xcite but there have been two distinct , differing interpretations of these modes . in the first interpretation ,",
    "referred to here as `` rotating static mode , '' the modes are assumed to have a steady - state geometry in some rest frame so that their apparent laboratory frame time - dependence is solely due to the rotation of the mode rest frame with respect to the laboratory frame . in this interpretation",
    "the modes are thus assumed to have a laboratory frame time - dependence @xmath103 so that an observer located in a frame rotating with the mode ( _ i.e. _ , a frame with coordinate @xmath104 ) would see a time - independent , or static , mode . in the second interpretation , referred to here as `` relaxation oscillation , '' the modes are not static in any frame but , rather , are growing modes which start with zero amplitude , build up to finite amplitude , undergo a nonlinear crash , and then the process repeats",
    ". there might be rotation as well , but even if one moved to an optimally chosen rotating frame , there still would be relaxation oscillations .",
    "thus , in the relaxation oscillation case , the mode time - dependence during its growth stage would be @xmath105 or possibly @xmath106 so that no change of observer rest frame would cause the mode to appear static .",
    "the @xmath0 modes were typically observed as oscillations in magnetic field during the _ sustainment _ ( as opposed to formation ) phase .",
    "however , it seems likely that sustainment ought to involve much the same processes as formation since formation requires creating a localized poloidal flux maximum , and sustainment requires maintaining this maximum against resistive losses .",
    "knox et al.@xcite observed @xmath0 and higher order modes using wall magnetic probe arrays and proposed that sustainment was due to a rotating static mode which they called a `` rotating internal kink distortion . '' on the other hand nagata et al.@xcite made similar magnetic probe measurements but interpreted sustainment as a sequence of relaxation oscillations (  collapse and recovery \" ) .",
    "thus knox et al .",
    "considered the mode as a rotating perturbation of an otherwise axisymmetric flux surface , whereas nagata et al .",
    "interpreted the mode as being the creation and destruction of flux surfaces .",
    "the sphex group@xcite used internal probes to identify two distinct structures in their experiment , namely ( i )  a central column of open magnetic field lines with a force - free current flowing from the gun electrode along the geometric axis and ( ii )  an annulus ( torus ) of closed field lines and toroidal current linking the central column .",
    "the sphex group found that the @xmath0 oscillations were primarily in the central column and , using probes , showed that the central column had a helical deformation .",
    "the helical deformation was inferred on the assumption that the @xmath0 oscillation was a rotating static mode , and this mode was interpreted to be a nonlinearly saturated kink instability of the _ geometric axis _",
    "current rotating toroidally at the @xmath107 frequency.@xcite it is important to emphasize that the rotation was _ _",
    "assumed__@xcite but not directly measured . because the signal was observed to be periodic , it was assumed that the fluctuations were of the form @xmath108 so that observations made at different times could be used to map out the spatial profile of the assumed rotating structure . however , this assumption of rotation misses the interpretation that there is a relaxation oscillation with repeated births of new helices , _",
    "i.e. _ , the rotation assumption did not consider the possibility of a repetitive sequence of modes with time behavior @xmath109 .",
    "the present results suggest that the @xmath0 fluctuations result from repeated births of new kinked helices with time dependence @xmath110 and that these helices detach and merge into the time - averaged closed flux region of a spheromak . according to this interpretation of spheromak formation / sustainment ,",
    "the current starts out aligned along the geometric axis and so is initially purely poloidal .",
    "then , upon kinking ( _ i.e. _ , the current channel becoming helical so that it is effectively a solenoid ) , the current channel axis has a toroidal component which creates new poloidal flux .",
    "kink growth means that the radius of the helix increases .",
    "growth of the kink , in turn , means that the radius of the helix increases until this radius becomes so large that the helical current channel merges with any existing spheromak toroidal current , thereby amplifying / sustaining the poloidal flux .",
    "new current will now flow from the gun along a new straight central column aligned along the geometric axis , and initially , this new central current column will be stable against kinking because of the strong axial magnetic field resulting from the strong toroidal current flowing in the spheromak .",
    "however , because no electromotive force sustains the spheromak toroidal current against ohmic decay , the spheromak toroidal current decays with time so that the poloidal field on the geometric axis becomes weaker .",
    "the open poloidal field on the geometric axis weakens to the point that a new kink develops on the geometric axis .",
    "the new kink deforms into a new solenoid which merges with the spheromak , replenishing the toroidal curent in the spheromak , and increasing the geometric axis open poloidal field so that the process starts over again .",
    "thus , power flow from the geometric axis region to the spheromak is not the result of rotation of a saturated kink but is instead due to the repetitive creation of successive helical ( kinked ) geometric axis current channels which expand nonlinearly in radius and merge with the spheromak .",
    "the interpretation in the above paragraph is buttressed by considering what happens when a simple solenoid , consisting of many turns of wire , is rotated about its own axis .",
    "such a rotation does not result in flow of magnetic energy or in transformation of toroidal field energy into poloidal field energy .",
    "in fact rotation of a solenoid about its axis does not change the magnetic field produced by the solenoid at all because rotation of a solenoid does not change the relative toroidal drift velocity between electrons and ions in the solenoid wire .",
    "in contrast , increasing the radius of the solenoid , as would be the consequence of a growing kink instability , increases the poloidal flux through the bore of the solenoid .",
    "if the conductor forming the solenoid ( _ i.e. _ , the initial geometric axis current channel ) is a flux conserver , then this increase of poloidal flux linking the conductor must be at the expense of a decrease in the toroidal flux linking the conductor , resulting in a conversion from toroidal to poloidal flux due to the kink .",
    "the primary result in this work regarding spheromak formation is the experimental demonstration that the kink instability of the geometric axis current and its growth result in the poloidal flux amplification required to produce the local maximum of poloidal flux necessary for spheromak formation .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar to the point of view expressed by lindberg et al .  and",
    "nagata et al .  but differs significantly from the point of view expressed by knox et al .  and the sphex group .",
    "the present work has provided a quantitative demonstration that the onset of the helical instability is consistent with the kruskal - shafranov condition for kink instability and a theoretical demonstration that the kink is necessarily paramagnetic ( _ i.e. _ , amplifies poloidal flux ) .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the poloidal flux amplification calculated using the visually observed kink dimensions are consistent with the magnetic probe measurements of poloidal flux .",
    "these measurements support the interpretation that poloidal flux amplification is due to kink _ growth _ and not kink rotation .",
    "repetition of this sequence with successive , new kinked current channels during sustainment could explain the previously observed @xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "the flux amplification mechanism would be insensitive to the magnitude or direction of the rotation frequency .",
    "magnetically - driven astrophysical jets are intriguing astronomical phenomena which have been observed for nearly a century .",
    "these jets are highly collimated and have been observed to emanate from stars , black holes , and active galactic nuclei ; the sources are generically called central objects .",
    "the characteristic size of jets ranges over many orders of magnitude , but in all cases the axial extent of the jet is much larger than the characteristic dimension of the source .",
    "theoretical models of jet formation and collimation have been discussed at length in the literature.@xcite observations of helical magnetic fields in jets@xcite provide especially tantalizing evidence that plasma physics plays an important role governing jet collimation , structure , and dynamics .",
    "theoretical models based on mhd have become the leading candidates to explain jet formation and collimation .",
    "many of these models show how axisymmetric force - free or nearly force - free plasma equilibria could be made to resemble the long thin morphology of a jet.@xcite more recently , time - dependent 3d mhd simulations@xcite have illustrated dynamical collimation starting with an initial `` seed '' magnetic field configuration . despite impressive similarities between the theoretical models and astronomical observations of jets , experiments to test the underpinnings of these theories have been lacking .",
    "the planar spheromak gun formation experiment discussed here has a geometry very similar to the geometry associated with the formation region of magnetically - driven astrophysical jets ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and so this work can be considered as a laboratory investigation into the underlying processes governing astrophysical jet formation , collimation , and acceleration.@xcite the mhd theories are based on the generation of an axisymmetric poloidal current with geometry essentially the same as the poloidal current in the central column of the present experiments . in the astrophysical situation ,",
    "this poloidal current is driven by a radial electric field resulting from the rotation of an accretion disk located in the equatorial plane of the central object .",
    "the rotation of the accretion disk cuts across a pre - existing poloidal magnetic field , resulting in an electric field @xmath111 , which is equivalent to the radial electric field applied across the gap between inner and outer electrodes in the experiment . in both cases ,",
    "magnetic helicity is injected at the rate @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the potential drop between the inner and outer electrodes ( or between star and disk ) and @xmath9 is the poloidal magnetic flux linking the two .",
    "the present work demonstrates experimentally for the first time that magnetic helicity injection in relevant geometry leads to the formation and collimation of a jet ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in particular ,",
    "the data indicate both a jet - like flow and a collimation of this flow , _ i.e. _ , the lengthening central column is the jet , and the narrowing of the central column is the collimation .",
    "the jet flow is consistent with a recent model@xcite proposing that axial gradients in @xmath114 drive axial flows from where the current channel radius is small to where the channel radius is large and that collimation occurs where @xmath115 is negative so that there is a compression of the toroidal flux frozen into the flow .",
    "the present work also shows that collimation can occur within just one twist of the poloidal magnetic field , as demonstrated by the fact that the kink instability occurs when @xmath63 drops to unity , _ after _ collimation has already been observed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the kink instability has been proposed to explain the observed knotted structures in astrophysical jets.@xcite",
    "magnetic helicity injection experiments using a simple magnetized coaxial gun setup have revealed insights into the dynamics of spheromak formation and collimation of magnetically - driven astrophysical jets .",
    "depending on the peak value of @xmath2 , three different plasma morphologies were observed : ( 1 )  a collimated jet at @xmath58  m@xmath59 , ( 2 )  kink instability of the jet at @xmath116  m@xmath59 , and ( 3 )  a quickly detached plasma at @xmath117  m@xmath59 .",
    "the kink instability was shown to provide the mechanism for poloidal flux amplification in coaxial gun spheromak formation .",
    "the latter result supports a model in which repeated births of kinked helices can form and sustain spheromaks .",
    "it is proposed that this mechanism , rather than a rotating static saturated kink which does not lead to flux amplification , could explain past observations of @xmath0 fluctuations in coaxial gun spheromak experiments . a collimated jet is formed by driving electric current along a background poloidal field in a geometry relevant for magnetically - driven astrophysical jets .",
    "collimation is observed well before kink onset .",
    "since kink onset takes place when the magnetic field has undergone one complete twist , consistent with the kruskal - shafranov theory , these observations demonstrate that collimation occurs before the initial poloidal field has undergone one complete twist .",
