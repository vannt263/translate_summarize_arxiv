    "phase ordering is emergence of order from disorder through domain growth and coarsening .",
    "the standard setting when phase ordering occurs is a temperature quench from a high - temperature disordered phase into a two - phase or a multiphase region .",
    "phase ordering has been the subject of extensive research during the last two decades @xcite .",
    "an important simplifying assumption in phase ordering theory is dynamic scale invariance . according to this assumption",
    ", the coarsening system possesses , at late times , a single relevant dynamic length scale @xmath3 ( the characteristic domain size ) which grows with time as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is by now well established that in systems with short range correlations @xmath5 for non - conserved ( model a ) dynamics , while @xmath6 for locally conserved ( model b ) dynamics .",
    "there is , however , an important additional coarsening mechanism : _ globally conserved _ phase ordering @xcite .",
    "globally conserved dynamics can be thought of as model a dynamics constrained by global conservation of the order parameter : for example , ising model with fixed magnetization .",
    "this global conservation law is maintained by an external field ( for example , a magnetic field ) which depends on time but is uniform in space .",
    "the globally - conserved phase ordering is accessible in experiment . consider the sublimation / deposition dynamics of a solid and its vapor in a small closed vessel kept at a constant temperature below the melting point .",
    "as the acoustic time scale in the gas phase is short compared to the coarsening time , the gas pressure ( and , consequently , density ) remain uniform in space , changing only in time .",
    "this character of mass transport in the vapor phase makes the coarsening dynamics conserved globally rather than locally .",
    "an important characteristics of globally - conserved dynamics is interface - controlled kinetics , in contrast to the bulk - diffusion - controlled kinetics typical for locally - conserved systems .",
    "interface - controlled kinetics was investigated in the context of growth of small platinum particles supported on alumina substrates in an oxidizing environment @xcite .",
    "there are additional examples of cluster growth on surfaces @xcite , where it was found possible to single out the interface - controlled kinetics @xcite .",
    "there is also strong evidence in favor of globally conserved interface - controlled transport during the coarsening of clusters in granular powders driven by a low - frequency electric field @xcite .",
    "part of the theoretical importance of globally conserved phase ordering lies in the fact that it enables an access to off - critical quenches in the simpler model a dynamics ( with global conservation ) .",
    "thus , it allows one to determine which characteristics of the system depend on the volume ( or area ) fraction @xmath7 and which do not .",
    "dynamic renormalization group arguments show that global conservation should not change the growth law @xcite .",
    "this early result was confirmed by particle simulations with short range correlations in the initial conditions : for critical ( @xmath8 ) @xcite and for off - critical ( @xmath9 ) @xcite quench .",
    "recent phase field simulations of systems with long - range ( power - law ) correlations in the initial conditions have also shown dynamic scale invariance with the same growth exponent @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 independently of @xmath7 . on the other hand , the autocorrelation function @xcite and persistence exponent @xcite were found to be @xmath7-dependent .",
    "globally conserved dynamics are related to a wide range of multiphase coarsening systems .",
    "sire and majumdar @xcite showed that in the large-@xmath10 limit the dynamics of the @xmath10-state potts model are equivalent to the dynamics of the globally conserved model with an area fraction @xmath11 .",
    "the large-@xmath10 limit of the potts model is of practical importance as it describes correctly some of the dynamic characteristics of dry soap froths @xcite and of the coarsening of polycrystalline materials @xcite .    in the limit of a vanishing volume fraction of the minority phase the late stage of coarsening is describable by the mean field theories of ostwald ripening .",
    "lifshitz and slyozov",
    "@xcite developed such a theory for the bulk - diffusion - controlled ( or locally conserved ) dynamics .",
    "they showed that the size distribution function of the minority domains approaches , at large times , a self - similar form .",
    "correspondingly , the average size of the minority phase domains grows with time like @xmath12 .",
    "following the seminal work by lifshitz and slyozov @xcite , wagner developed a similar mean - field theory for the interface - controlled ( globally conserved ) ostwald ripening @xcite .",
    "the wagner s theory yields a growth law @xmath13 for the average domain size , and a different ( broader ) shape of the scaled distribution function .",
    "we shall refer to this scaled distribution function as the wagner distribution .",
    "more recently , it was shown that interface - controlled ostwald ripening appears in the sharp - interface limit of scalar ginzburg - landau equations ( and its modifications ) with a global conservation law @xcite .    although the simple theories of lifshitz - slyozov and wagner were developed more than 40 years ago , they are still very useful in phase ordering theory . for example , sire and majumdar @xcite employed the wagner distribution to calculate the equal - time pair correlation function .",
    "lee and rutenberg @xcite used the two theories of ostwald ripening for calculating the autocorrelation exponent and persistence exponent for the locally- and globally - conserved systems .",
    "many works were devoted to extensions of the lifshitz - slyozov theory to finite volume fractions .",
    "already lifshitz and slyozov @xcite made an attempt to go beyond their simple model and account for coalescence .",
    "later it became clear that , in the locally - conserved systems , the dominant effect unaccounted for by the simple theory is inter - domain correlations , rather than coalescence . at small area fractions ,",
    "the relative role of correlations is of order @xmath14 @xcite , while the relative role of coalescence is of order @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , an account of coalescence without a proper account of correlations is an excess of accuracy .",
    "the situation is quite different in globally - conserved systems , and this fact has not been recognized until now .",
    "correlations between neighboring domains are _ exponentially _ small in this case @xcite .",
    "therefore , coalescence is expected to give the dominant correction to the theory of wagner @xcite . we shall report numerical simulations that show a strong effect of coalescence at moderate @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , we find that , at large times , the size distribution function of the minority domains has a self - similar form with the  normal \" growth exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the scaled distribution function , however , strongly differs from the wagner distribution .",
    "we attribute this difference to coalescence and develop a new theory of ostwald ripening that takes coalescence into account .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is the following . in section [ model ]",
    "we briefly review the phase field model of globally conserved phase ordering : a scalar ginzburg - landau equation with a global conservation law .",
    "the sharp - interface asymptotic limit of this equation is introduced and reduced , in 2d , to a simpler model of area - preserving motion by curvature .",
    "the criteria for the validity of this reduction are obtained and presented in appendix .",
    "the model of area - preserving motion by curvature is used to obtain dynamic scaling laws for the characteristic coarsening length and for the effective magnetic field .",
    "the results of the phase field simulations for the critical quench ( @xmath15 ) and off - critical quench ( @xmath16 ) are presented and analyzed in section [ simu ] . in section [ sor ] a new theory of ostwald ripening is developed .",
    "the theory leads to a non - linear integro - differential equation for the scaled distribution function .",

    "we shall see in the following that an account of coalescence also leads to strong selection , even in the absence of fluctuations .",
    "we shall now take into account the processes of binary coalescence .",
    "coalescence events occur when two droplets contact each other . within the framework of the gle ,",

    "binder and stauffer @xcite suggested a mean - field scenario of phase separation in alloys in which clusters of the minority phase are regarded as brownian particles : they perform random walk in space .",
    "when two clusters collide , they merge into a larger single cluster .",

    "( [ c7 ] ) , but with a different kernel @xmath168 . if the cluster diffusivity is a power - law function of the cluster size , one arrives at a self - similar solution for the size distribution function of the droplets .",
