    "lyapunov exponents are fundamental to our understanding of chaotic processes .",
    "they describe the time - asymptotic rate of separation of neighboring trajectories in a dynamical system , and are global properties of a chaotic region , independent of the trajectory chosen to measure them ( the fiducial trajectory ) .",
    "this independence is a consequence of a theorem of oseledec,@xcite which applies in the limit of infinite time .",
    "in contrast , the _ finite - time _",
    "lyapunov exponents , which describe the instantaneous rate of separation of neighboring trajectories , depend on the choice of fiducial trajectory and so characterize local properties of the chaotic region .",
    "similarly , the characteristic direction of expansion or contraction associated with each exponent is a local property of the chaotic region ; it converges exponentially to its time - asymptotic orientation@xcite  a much more rapid convergence rate than that of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the slow convergence of the lyapunov exponents means that in practical situations , _",
    "i.e. _ , a computer or laboratory experiment , the system under study only rarely evolves long enough to `` feel '' the value of the true , infinite - time lyapunov exponents .",
    "rather , the rates of stretching and contracting of infinitesimal elements of phase - space are dominated by local effects , described by the finite - time lyapunov exponents . in fluid dynamics and plasma physics ,",
    "these rates are tied to the strong enhancement of transport observed in chaotic mixing.@xcite thus , the spatial and temporal behavior of the finite - time lyapunov exponents is worthy of study in its own right , in addition to their time - asymptotic value .    in the present paper",
    "we expand upon the work of tang and boozer@xcite on the geometrical properties of finite - time lyapunov exponents .",
    "we consider an arbitrary smooth dynamical system , which we take to be a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , but could also be a discrete map .",
    "for such a system , the solution of the equations of motion is a smooth coordinate transformation ( diffeomorphism ) from the space of initial conditions ( the lagrangian coordinates , which label a trajectory ) to the state of the system at a later time ( the eulerian coordinates ) .",
    "the coordinate transformation is smooth even when the system is chaotic , though it then becomes extremely complicated .    to define lyapunov exponents , it is necessary to define a norm on the space of our dynamical system , that is , a prescription for measuring distances .",
    "this norm is used to quantify the exponential separation of trajectories .",
    "the usual choice is the euclidean norm , a mathematical embodiment of what we intuitively think of as distance .",
    "the euclidean norm is also the simplest realization of a flat space .",
    "in essence , flatness is an intrinsic property of a space that reflects the commutativity of partial derivatives , a fact that is not so trivial in general coordinate systems .",
    "flatness is taken for granted in most numerical and laboratory experiments , as reflected by the use of the euclidean norm .",
    "when a space is not flat , it is said to have curvature ; an example is a two - dimensional sphere embedded in three - dimensional space , used in some geophysical models where the atmosphere or the ocean is regarded as very thin .",
    "but presently we deal only with flat systems .",
    "a remarkable result of differential geometry is the existence and uniqueness of the riemann curvature tensor , which vanishes if and only if the the underlying space is flat ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : riemann ] ) .",
    "the riemann tensor plays a central role in general relativity , where the curvature of space determines the gravitational forces on matter and light rays . here , we shall only use curvature as a geometrical property ; we make no use of general relativity .",
    "when the riemann tensor vanishes in one coordinate system ( usually , in cartesian coordinates with the euclidean norm ) , it also vanishes in any other coordinate system reached by a smooth transformation.@xcite in particular , in a smooth dynamical system the transformation from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates leaves a vanishing riemann tensor invariant . when the system is chaotic , so that trajectories exhibit exponential separation , some terms in the riemann tensor exhibit exponential growth , while others decrease exponentially . because the riemann tensor vanishes identically",
    ", these terms have to balance each other ; this requires the finite - time lyapunov exponents and their associated characteristic directions to satisfy certain differential relations , or constraints , as was demonstrated for two - dimensional systems by tang and boozer.@xcite under more general conditions and using the orthonormal basis form of the metric tensor,@xcite we rederive their constraint and analyze its rate of convergence carefully .",
    "we also extend the calculation to three dimensions , confirming a constraint conjectured by tang and boozer,@xcite as well as deriving new ones .",
    "we support our theoretical claims with numerical simulations on two- ( oscillating convection rolls@xcite ) and three - dimensional flows ( @xmath0 flow@xcite and the lorenz model@xcite )",
    ". we also comment on the possible physical applications of the constraints , specifically to the advection - diffusion equation and the dynamo problem .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffgeom ] we review some basic concepts of differential geometry , as applied to dynamical systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : riemann ] we focus our attention on the riemann curvature tensor and its properties .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec : twodsystems ] we examine the nature of the vanishing curvature requirement in two dimensions .",
    "we obtain a constraint relating the derivatives of the smallest lyapunov exponent and the stable direction vector . in sec .  [",
    "sec : threedsystems ] we carry out the same procedure in three dimensions , deriving three new constraints .",
    "we find that a combination of two of these constraints yields the same differential relation as in the two - dimensional case ; the persistence of this constraint in three dimensions was conjectured by tang and boozer,@xcite who were guided by numerical investigation of three - dimensional volume - preserving maps .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarize our results , and discuss possible applications of the constraints .",
    "[ sec : diffgeom ]    in this section we describe the point of view that the solution of a set of differential equations is a coordinate transformation from the set of initial conditions to the state of the system at a later time . in that sense ,",
    "the time evolution is a map of the fluid domain onto itself .",
    "moreover , if we assume that the dynamics are `` smooth , '' the properties of the coordinate transformation are described by differential geometry .",
    "an analysis of these properties is the focus of this paper .",
    "we consider a prescribed smooth two- or three - dimensional vector field given by  @xmath1 .",
    "for example ,  @xmath1 could be a fluid flow obtained by a solution of the navier  stokes equation , but in general the vector field does not have to correspond to such a fluid flow : it can represent the right - hand side of any smooth system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , because of the convenient framework provided by a fluid flow , we often refer to the phase space domain of  @xmath2 as `` the fluid '' and to infinitesimal elements of phase space as `` fluid elements '' .",
    "the _ eulerian _ coordinates , @xmath2 , denote the position of a point fixed in the `` laboratory '' frame .",
    "the trajectory of an infinitesimal element of phase space ( also called a fluid element by analogy with the fluid - dynamical case ) in eulerian coordinates , @xmath2 , satisfies @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the _ lagrangian _ coordinates that label fluid elements : they are coordinates that describe a frame moving with the fluid .",
    "we have made the usual choice of taking as initial condition @xmath5 , which says that fluid elements are labeled by their initial position ; thus , eulerian and lagrangian coordinates coincide at @xmath6 .    the solution @xmath7 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrcdef ] ) is the transformation from lagrangian ( @xmath4 ) to eulerian ( @xmath2 ) coordinates . for a chaotic flow ,",
    "this transformation gets extremely complicated as time evolves .",
    "however , since we have assumed that @xmath8 is a smooth vector field , the transformation is always differentiable , so that the jacobian matrix @xmath9 is well - defined .",
    "this allows us to use the tools of differential geometry on the transformation @xmath10 .    since our focus is on the rate of separation of neighboring trajectories , as characterized by the lyapunov exponents , we need to define a way of measuring distances in the eulerian coordinates , _ i.e. _ , a _ norm _ for vectors in the space .",
    "the norm we use is the euclidean norm , defined by  , where  @xmath11 is the dimension of the space . with this norm ,",
    "the distance  @xmath12 between two infinitesimally separated trajectories  @xmath10 and   is @xmath13 we use the chain rule to write this distance in terms of the initial separation  @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 in the terminology of differential geometry , eq .",
    "( [ eq : metricdef ] ) is the flat metric tensor @xmath17 of eulerian space transformed to lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the metric @xmath18 is a symmetric , positive - definite matrix that tells us the distance between two infinitesimally separated points in lagrangian space .",
    "because @xmath18 is symmetric and positive - definite , it has @xmath11 positive real eigenvalues , which we denote by @xmath19 , with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath20 ; we can then write the metric in the diagonal form @xmath21 where  @xmath22 is the  @xmath23th component of  @xmath24 . we assume without loss of generality that   for  .",
    "the eigenvectors  @xmath24 define directions of initial separations for which neighboring fluid elements are converging or diverging , with  @xmath25 the distance separating them .",
    "it is the rate of exponential growth of these distances that defines the _ finite - time lyapunov exponents _ ( or characteristic exponents ) @xmath26 ( the factor of @xmath27 enters because @xmath28 is the square of the distance . ) in the limit as  @xmath29 , the finite - time lyapunov exponents converge to the true lyapunov exponents ,  @xmath30 , which are independent of  @xmath31 and @xmath4.@xcite a flow is said to be _ chaotic _",
    "if at least one of its lyapunov exponents converges to a positive value . however , this convergence is very slow ( logarithmic in time ) : in practical applications we are almost always dealing with finite - time lyapunov exponents . for",
    "the remainder of this paper , `` lyapunov exponents '' refers to the finite - time exponents , unless explicitly denoted as infinite - time . whereas the lyapunov exponents converge very slowly , in a chaotic region the characteristic directions  @xmath20 ( the eigenvectors of  @xmath18 ) converge rapidly ( exponentially fast ) to their time - asymptotic value ,  @xmath32.@xcite    in the chaotic case",
    ", we assume that @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , so that there is at least one exponentially expanding and one exponentially contracting direction .",
    "these are referred to as the unstable and stable directions , respectively . in three dimensions , the intermediate exponent  @xmath37",
    "can have either sign . for bounded , autonomous flows ( where the velocity field @xmath8 does not depend explicitly on time ) , the intermediate lyapunov exponent must converge to zero in the infinite - time limit.@xcite for simplicity , we shall often use   to mean  , and write  .",
    "the letters  @xmath38 are abbreviations for `` unstable '' , `` middle '' , and `` stable '' directions , respectively . in two dimensions",
    ", we drop the extraneous middle direction and use @xmath39 to mean  @xmath40 , and write  .",
    "the existence of a contracting direction in a chaotic flow follows from the assumption that the determinant of @xmath18 @xmath41 stays bounded with time ; otherwise , the volume of fluid elements grows indefinitely , usually an undesirable situation from the physical standpoint .",
    "however , a bounded  @xmath42 is only a sufficient condition for the existence of a contracting direction , which often exists without this requirement .",
    "note that  @xmath43 for incompressible flows ( @xmath44 ) .    in theory ,",
    "the numerical procedure for finding the characteristic directions and exponents is straightforward : we integrate the ordinary differential equations  ( [ eq : lagrcdef ] ) with initial conditions  @xmath4 , together with the set of  @xmath45 equations on the tangent space , @xmath46 with initial conditions  .",
    "the metric is then formed from  @xmath9 using the definition  ( [ eq : metricdef ] ) , and its  @xmath11 eigenvalues  @xmath47 and eigenvectors  @xmath24 are obtained via standard numerical techniques . in practice , for a chaotic flow , the elements of the jacobian matrix  @xmath48 grow exponentially , and one quickly runs into numerical accuracy problems related to subtracting very large numbers .",
    "many methods have been devised to circumvent this difficulty,@xcite and we shall use the method of greene and kim@xcite .",
    "most methods yield a quantity that differs by a factor proportional to  @xmath49 from the true finite - time lyapunov exponent , and so need to be corrected.@xcite    to illustrate the concept of the characteristic directions  @xmath24 , let us take the two - dimensional , time - dependent periodic flow , @xmath50 this flow is incompressible ( @xmath44 , so that  @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is used by many authors ( see for example refs .   and  ) to model a periodic set of oscillating convection rolls .",
    "the parameters are the amplitude of the rolls , @xmath51 , the relative amplitude of the oscillations , @xmath52 , the aspect ratio , @xmath53 , and the frequency of oscillations , @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath55 , the flow is steady , and the lagrangian trajectories are nonchaotic .",
    "this is true in general of any two - dimensional steady flow.@xcite    figure  [ fig : oscrollsman ] shows the field of stable directions @xmath56 for the oscillating rolls , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ocr ] ) .",
    "the two lines in the figure are portions of stable manifolds , obtained by integrating the set of  @xmath11 ordinary differential equations @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the arc length along the manifold . in a chaotic flow ,",

    "analogous to the stable manifold , there is an unstable manifold corresponding to @xmath60 ( and , in three dimensions , a manifold corresponding to  ) .",
