    "the heun functions appear with increasing frequency in modern physics . for example , they arise in the schrdinger equation with anharmonic potential , in water molecule , in the stark effect , in different quantum phenomena related with repulsion and attraction of levels , in the theory of lunar motion , in gravitational physics of scalar , spinor , electromagnetic and gravitational waves in schwarzschild and kerr metric , in crystalline materials , in three - dimensional waves in atmosphere , in bethe anzatz systems , in collogero - moser - sutherland systems , e.t.c . , just to mention a few . because of the wide range of their applications ( @xcite) from quantum mechanics to astrophysics , from lattice systems to economics ",
    "they can be considered as the @xmath0 century successors of the hypergeometric functions encountered in some simple physical problems of @xmath1 century .",
    "it is not hard to explain this situation . in natural sciences ,",
    "in particular , in physics we usually study the different phenomena starting from some equilibrium state",
    ". then we study small deviations from it in linear approximation , and at the end , going far away from the equilibrium we are forced to take into account nonlinear phenomena .",
    "it is well known that to describe the wave processes ( like those in quantum mechanics ) , related with some linear phenomenon in classical physics ( like classical mechanics ) , we have to use hypergeometric functions .",
    "therefore these functions were well studied in @xmath2 and @xmath1centuries and today one can find the corresponding codes in all good computer packages . according to the theorem by slavyanov @xcite , if we study nonlinear classical phenomena , described by elliptic functions , or even by the solutions of any of painlev type equations , the corresponding wave problems can be solved exactly in terms of the heun functions .",
    "since the painlev equations can be considered as hamilton ones for a very large class of nonlinear classical problems , one can expect a fast increase in the applications of the heun functions in physics and other natural sciences of @xmath3 century .",
    "their mathematical complexity , however , makes working with them a significant challenge both analytically and numerically .",
    "the heun functions are unique local frobenius solutions of a second - order linear ordinary differential equation of the fuchsian type @xcite which in the general case have 4 regular singular points",
    ". two or more of those regular singularities can coalesce into an irregular singularity leading differential equations of the confluent type and their solutions : confluent heun function , biconfluent heun function , double confluent heun function and triconfluent heun function .",
    "the heun functions generalize the hypergeometric function ( and also include the lam function , mathieu function and the spheroidal wave functions @xcite ) and some of their uses can be found in @xcite and also in the more recent @xcite . clearly , the heun functions will be encountered more and more in modern physics , hence , there is a need of better understanding of those functions and new , more adequate algorithms working with them .    despite the growing number of articles which use equations from the heun type and their solutions ,",
    "the theory of those functions is far from complete .",
    "there are some analytical works on the heun functions , but they were largely neglected until recently .",
    "some recent progress can be found in @xcite , but as a whole there are many gaps in our knowledge of those functions .",
    "particularly , the connection problem for the heun functions is not solved ",
    "one can not connect two local solutions at different singular points using known constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "another example of a serious gap in the general theory of the heun functions in general is the absence of integral representations analogous to the one for hypergeometric functions . according to whittaker s hypothesis ,",
    "the heun s functions are the simplest class of special functions for which no representations in form of contour integrals of elementary functions exists . in some particular cases",
    "are known integral representations in form of double integrals of elementary functions , but the general case is an open problem .",
    "numerically , the only software package currently able to work with the heun functions is maple .",
    "alternative ways for evaluations of those functions do not exist ( to the best of our knowledge ) and there are no known projects aiming to change this situation , an admittedly immense task by itself .",
    "this means that the use of the heun functions is limited to the routines hidden in the kernel of maple , which the user can not change or improve  a situation that makes understanding the numerical problems or avoiding them adequately very difficult . on the positive side ,",
    "those routines were found by the team to work well enough in many cases ( see , for example , the match between theory and numerical results in @xcite , as well as the other applications of those functions in @xcite ) . yet , there are some peculiarities  there are values of the parameters where the routines break down leading to infinities or to numerical errors .",
    "the situation with the derivatives of the heun functions in maple is even worst  for some values they simply do not work , for example outside the domain @xmath4 , where their precision is much lower than that of the heun function itself .",
    "also , in some cases there are no convenient power - series representations and then the heun functions are evaluated in maple using numerical integration .",
    "therefore the procedure goes slowly in the complex domain ( compared to the hypergeometric function ) which means that the convergence of the root - finding algorithm is essential when one solves equations including heun s functions .",
    "despite all the numerical set - backs , the heun functions offer many opportunities to modern physics . they occur in the problem of quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) of rotating and nonrotating black holes , which is to some extent the gravity analogue of the problem of the hydrogen atom . finding the qnms is critical to understanding observational data from gravitational wave detectors and proving or refuting the black holes existence ( @xcite and also @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", one has to solve a two - dimensional connected spectral problem with two complex equations in each of which one encounters the confluent heun functions . the analytical theory of the confluent heun function is more developed than that of the other types of heun functions , but still many unknowns remain .",
    "again , the evaluation of the derivative of the confluent heun function is problematic in maple , which makes newton s root - finding algorithm ( @xcite ) unusable .",
    "broyden s algorithm ( @xcite ) generally works , but it is slowly convergent even close to a root ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that we need a novel algorithm , that will offer quicker convergence than broyden s algorithm , but without relying on derivatives .    to solve this problem , in the case of a system of two equations in two variables ,",
    "our team developed a two - dimensional generalization of the mller algorithm .",
    "the one - dimensional mller algorithm ( @xcite ) is a quadratic generalization of the secant method , that works well in the case of a complex function of one variable .",
    "it has very good convergence for a large class of functions ( @xmath5 ) and it is very efficient when the starting point ( the initial guess ) is close to a root ( for applications see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is also well convergent when working with special transcendental functions such as the heun functions .",
    "most importantly , this algorithm does not use derivatives , which is key for our work .",
    "the two - dimensional mller algorithm seems to inherit some of the advantages of its one - dimensional counterpart like good convergence and usability on large class of functions as our tests show .",
    "the new algorithm was used to solve the qnm problem in the case of a schwarzschild black hole and it proved to work without significant deviations from the results published by andersson ( @xcite ) and fiziev ( @xcite ) . also , preliminary results for the qnm of the kerr black hole are discussed and for them we also obtain a very good coincidence with published results @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section 2 reviews the one - dimensional mller algorithm and it introduces in detail its two - dimensional generalization , in section 3 we give two examples of the application of the new method in systems featuring the confluent heun functions  the qnms of rotating and nonrotating bh , and the results in both cases are analyzed in terms of precision and convergence . in section 4 we summarize our results .",
    "the one - dimensional mller algorithm ( @xcite ) is iterative method which at each step evaluates the function at three points , builds the parabola crossing those points and finds the two points where that parabola crosses the x - axis .",
    "the next iteration is the the point farthest from the initial point .",
    "explicitly , the one - dimensional mller algorithm can be defined as the map @xmath6 , which obtains the final point @xmath7 in @xmath8 iterations by calculating for every three points @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( with the corresponding values of the function @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , the next iteration @xmath15 as : @xmath16    the iterations continue until @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of digits of precision we require .",
    "this exit - condition works independently of the actual numerical zero in use , which may vary for the confluent heun function and thus it is the most appropriate for our numerical work .",
    "the two - dimensional mller method comes as a natural extension of the one - dimensional mller method .    for two complex - valued functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 we want to find such pairs of complex numbers @xmath21 which are solutions of the system : @xmath22 where @xmath23 numbers the solution in use . from now on , we will omit the index @xmath24 , considering that we work with one arbitrary particular solution . finding all the solutions of a system",
    "is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "consider the functions @xmath25 as two - dimensional _ complex _ surfaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 in a three - dimensional space of the _ complex _",
    "variables @xmath28 .",
    "normally , to solve the system , one expresses the relation @xmath29 from one of the equations , then by substituting it in the other equation , one solves it for @xmath30 and from @xmath29 one finds @xmath31 . in the general case , however , this is not possible .",
    "the idea of our code is to approximately follow that procedure by finding an approximate linear relation @xmath29 between the two variables and then using it to find the root of function of one variable trough the one - dimensional mller algorithm .    to find the linear relation @xmath29 , at each iteration we form the plane passing trough three points of one of the functions and then the equation of the line of intersection between that plane and the plane @xmath32 is used as the approximate relation @xmath29",
    "this basically means that the so found @xmath29 is an approximate solution of one of the equations which ideally should be near the real solution in the @xmath32 plane . substituting this relation in the other function , we run the one - dimensional mller algorithm on it to fix the value of one of the variables , say @xmath30 . using the value of @xmath30 in the first function",
    ", we again run the one - dimensional mller algorithm on it to fix the value of the other variable  @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively one can substitute the value of @xmath30 directly in @xmath29 to obtain @xmath31 .",
    "this ends one iteration of the algorithm .",
    "the process repeats until one of the exit - conditions discussed below has been reached .",
    "the block - scheme of the algorithm can be seen on fig .",
    "( [ block ] ) .",
    "is the plane with equation @xmath33 that crosses trough the 3 pairs of points @xmath34 and the function @xmath35 evaluated in them .",
    "the plane @xmath36 is defined by the equation @xmath32 .",
    "the one - dimensional mller algorithm , @xmath37 , is applied on the function of _ one variable _",
    "@xmath38 with starting point @xmath39 and final point @xmath40.,width=300,height=200 ]    explicitly , the code starts by evaluating the two functions @xmath41 in three starting pairs of points ( @xmath42 ) that ideally should be near one of the roots of the system . in our case , those three _ initial _",
    "pairs are obtained from one starting pair to which we add and subtract certain small complex number .",
    "this artificial choice is done only in the first iteration ( @xmath43 ) , afterwards we use the output of the last three iterations to form @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the respective @xmath46 . thus on every iteration after @xmath43 the actual complex functions",
    "@xmath47 are evaluated only once outside of the one - dimensional mler subroutines .",
    "next we construct the plane passing trough those three points for one of the functions , say @xmath35 by solving the linear system : @xmath48 from it one obtains the coefficients @xmath49 of the plane @xmath50 .",
    "this plane is intersected with the plane @xmath32 and the equation of the line between those two planes is the approximate relation @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath51 ) of the two variables .",
    "we substitute that relation in the first function @xmath52 and we start the one - dimensional mller on that  linearized  function of only one variable , @xmath30 . after some pre - determined maximal number of iterations , the exiting point is chosen for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "then , there are two possibilities .    algorithm m1",
    ": one could use directly the relation @xmath55 to find @xmath56 . or ,    algorithm m2 : one can substitute @xmath57 in the other function @xmath58 in order to find @xmath59 using again the one - dimensional mller algorithm ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "our numerical experiments showed that both approaches lead to convergent procedure .",
    "after @xmath61 are fixed , the two functions @xmath62 are evaluated and if the new points are not roots , the iterations continue .",
    "the exit - strategy in the two - dimensional mller algorithm is as follows :    1 .   to avoid hanging of the algorithm or its deviation from the actual root of the system , one fixes the maximal number of iterations for the one - dimensional mller subroutine , @xmath8 . from our experience",
    ", @xmath63 gives best convergence .",
    "the precision - condition ( @xmath64 ) remains in force for the one - dimensional mller algorithm .",
    "usually the subroutine exits , because of @xmath65 during the first few iterations of the two - dimensional mller algorithm , until it gets closer to the roots and exits with @xmath64 .",
    "the primary exit - condition of the two - dimensional mller is fulfilled when for two consecutive pairs @xmath66 : @xmath67 . in this case , if the values of functions @xmath68 at those points are sufficiently small , the algorithm exits with a root .",
    "4 .   to keep the two - dimensional mller algorithm from hanging , a maximal number of iterations @xmath69 should be set . for @xmath70 the algorithm exits without fixing a root . 5 .   a common problem occurs when one of the functions becomes zero before the other function .",
    "a possible way out is to substitute one of the so - fixed variables , say @xmath71 , in the non - zero function and to to run the one - dimensional mller subroutine using the other variable  @xmath72 .",
    "the algorithm then exits with a possible root : @xmath73 .",
    "the procedure can be fine - tuned trough change in the starting pair of points , the initial deviation or by switching the places of the functions , or even by replacing the functions with their independent linear combinations .",
    "the numerical experiments of the application of this algorithm on systems featuring different classes of functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the tests showed that the algorithm inherits some of the advantages of the one - dimensional mller algorithm , like the quick convergence in proximity of the root and the vast class of functions that it can work with .",
    "the major disadvantage comes from the complicated behavior of the two - dimensional complex surfaces defined by the functions @xmath46 which requires one to find the best combination of starting points and number of iterations in the one - dimensional mller subroutine so that the algorithm converges to the required root ( if it is known or suspected ) . generally , it is hard to tell when one point is `` close '' to a root . in some cases , even if certain starting pair of points is close to a root in terms of some norm , using it as a starting point in the algorithm may still lead to convergence to another root or simply to require more iterations to reach the desired root than if other pair of starting points were used .",
    "it is important to note that unlike broyden s algorithm and newton s algorithm which do not dependent on the order of the equations in the system , our two - dimensional mller algorithm depends on the order of the equations .",
    "the numerical experiments show that while for some systems , changing the places of the equations has little or no effect on the convergence , in other cases , it slows down or completely breaks down the convergence .",
    "while such inherent asymmetry certainly is a weakness of the algorithm , there are ways around it . for example , one may alternate the places of the equations at each iteration or use their independent linear combinations ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "those approaches make the algorithm more robust , but since they may cost speed , we prefer to set the order of the equations manually .",
    "a technical disadvantage is that the whole procedure is more cpu - expensive than newton s method and broyden s method , since it generally makes more evaluations of the functions ",
    "each one - dimensional mller makes at least @xmath75 iteration on every step of the two - dimensional mller , thus it makes at least @xmath76 evaluations of each function .",
    "this is because on each iteration of the two - dimensional mller algorithm the functions in use change and thus one can not use previous evaluations to reduce time .",
    "still , in some cases , as demonstrated in @xcite and also below , the so - constructed algorithm is quicker or comparable to newton s or broyden s method .",
    "we will work only with the confluent heun functions , which are much better studied than the other types of heun functions , due to their numerous physical applications . besides their numerical implementation was used successfully in previous works by the authors . for details on the numerical testing , see @xcite .",
    "the quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) of a black hole ( bh ) are the complex frequencies ( @xmath77 ) that govern the late - time evolution of the perturbations of the bh metric ( @xcite ) , which have been extensively studied .",
    "first , we consider the problem of the gravitational qnms of a nonrotating black hole so that the precision of the new method can be tested on a very well studied physical problem .",
    "the physical results in this case were published in @xcite , so here we will focus on the numerical details instead .    to find the qnms ,",
    "one uses the exact solutions of the regge - wheeler equations , describing the linearized perturbations of schwarzschild metric , in terms of confluent heun functions(@xcite ) . from @xcite ,",
    "when the mass of the bh is set to @xmath78 , one obtains the following system of the type : @xmath79    where @xmath77 is a complex frequency , @xmath80 is the angular momentum of the perturbation , @xmath81 $ ] is the angle which we set to @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "heunc is the confluent heun function ( @xcite ) in maple notations .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 is a small variation ( @xmath85 ) in the phase condition @xmath86 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "using eqs .",
    ", we run the two - dimensional mller algorithm to find the unknown @xmath80 and @xmath77 with precision of the algorithms set to @xmath87 digits .    from the theory ,",
    "it is known that @xmath80 is an integer and @xmath88 . comparing with the results obtained by the two - dimensional mller algorithm , for the first root @xmath89 , one has @xmath90 , with the first different from @xmath91 digit being the @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that the new algorithm is capable of solving systems with one purely integer root in the pair with the expected precision .",
    "a comparison of the new algorithm with the well - known newton s and broyden s methods , can be found in table [ table3 ] .",
    "mode:&0&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10 + @xmath93 [ s]&100&99&156&196&386&240&253&282&302&368&398 + @xmath94 [ s]&317&413&595&741&1175&799&874&892&1364&971&1355 + @xmath95 [ s]&202&218&335&357&497&457&396&613&623&594&667 +    because the phase condition @xmath96 includes the complex argument in non - analytical way , which can not be differentiated , this problem can not be solved directly using newton s method .",
    "broyden s method works but with serious limitation of its precision .",
    "this happens , because one of the roots @xmath31 in the pair @xmath97 is a real integer , while the other is complex and the algorithm fixes the integer root very quickly , thus the finite differences in the jacobian become infinity .",
    "because of this , the algorithm is able to fix only the first @xmath98 digits , while the other algorithms fix @xmath99 digits .",
    "therefore , although broyden s algorithm gives better times ( see table [ table3 ] ) than the two - dimensional mller algorithms , its precision is much lower and for modes with big imaginary part , it can not be increased even by raising the software floating - point number to very high values .",
    "furthermore , from table [ table3 ] , one can see that the time needed for the each algorithm to exit with a root dramatically increases with @xmath100 .",
    "this emphasize on the importance of the convergence of the algorithm , which may become critical in physical problems where multiple roots must be found ( see the second example ) .    the numerical results for the qnms are summed in table ( [ table2 ] ) . in it , the qnm frequencies obtained from sys .",
    "are compared to those found by andersson ( @xcite ) with the phase amplitude method .",
    "recently , those results were confirmed by fiziev ( see @xcite ) with the one - dimensional mller method applied on the exact solutions of the radial equation in terms of the confluent heun function for @xmath89 . to check the accurateness of the new method",
