    "the rapidly developing new field of atom optics @xcite exploits wave aspects of quantum mechanical particles and associated interference effects , similar to electron and neutron interferometry .",
    "typical optics experiments have been carried over to atoms .",
    "for example , an atomic beam can be passed through a double slit or through a transmission grating and the diffraction pattern can be observed @xcite . in such experiments",
    "the incoming atoms usually can be considered as point particles and described by plane waves .",
    "the standard wave - theoretical methods and approximations of classical optics ( huygens , kirchhoff ) have been successfully applied in atom optics and yield in general good agreement with experiment . indeed , in view of the success of these methods one might be inclined to think that all theory needed for atom optics is contained in a good optics book .",
    "new problems and challenges , however , might arise for diffraction experiments with molecules , in particular with weakly bound systems .",
    "a system , when observed at a nonzero diffraction angle from the incident direction , clearly has received a momentum transfer from the grating . for weakly bound systems this might induce break - up processes which in turn might change the diffraction pattern . moreover , weakly bound systems in general are larger than atoms .",
    "treatment as a point particle might therefore not be adequate when the grating slits approach the size of the system and when therefore more break - up processes are to be expected .",
    "in fact , it is an interesting and difficult dynamical problem how a relatively large molecule squeezes through a slit .    in view of recent diffraction experiments with molecules",
    "this is not a moot question .",
    "grating diffraction of both he@xmath0 @xcite and of na@xmath0 @xcite have been observed @xcite .",
    "the molecule na@xmath0 is very small compared to present - day slit widths and the binding energy is large compared to the incident molecular kinetic energy .",
    "therefore no appreciable deviations from point particle diffraction are expected even if present - day slit widths are reduced by a factor of 2 or 4 . on the other hand , for the helium dimer he@xmath0 ,",
    "discovered a few years ago @xcite , the extremely low binding energy of @xmath1 @xmath2ev ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is much smaller than the incident kinetic energy of typical experiments .",
    "its estimated diameter of about 6 nm @xcite is still an order of magnitude smaller than the slit widths used in the experiments , but a further reduction in the slit width might make a difference .    a theoretical analysis of diffraction of weakly bound systems by a transmission grating , as undertaken in this paper ,",
    "may therefore be of more than only academic interest .",
    "we restrict ourselves to diatomic systems .",
    "since diffraction by a transmission grating is really a scattering by the bars of the grating and since we want to include break - up processes and finite - size effects we use quantum mechanical scattering theory . as in the case of point - particle diffraction",
    "we describe the effect of the grating bars by a short - range repulsive ( `` reflecting '' ) potential .",
    "attractive parts to the potential could also be included , but for simplicity this is not done here .    as usual we neglect the electronic degrees of freedom of the two atoms .",
    "we thus consider a bound system of two interacting particles and its scattering by an external potential . due to the presence of the latter",
    "this problem does not resemble so much one - particle scattering but rather the three - body problem ( the external potential playing the role of the third body ) .",
    "not surprisingly one can therefore use similar methods .",
    "we have found it advantageous to employ the faddeev approach @xcite in its formulation by alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) @xcite .",
    "briefly , our results are the following .",
    "we obtain an analytic expression for the elastic diffraction amplitude of a weakly bound two - particle system which  implicitly  incorporates break - up processes and finite - size effects .",
    "we also give an expression for diffraction including excitation and de - excitation of the two - particle system , but the break - up channel is not explicitly treated here .",
    "provided the bar and slit width of the grating are not much smaller than the molecular diameter , the diffraction amplitude contains the familiar grating function of classical optics as a factor .",
    "this grating function appears automatically from our general results , and we give a simple intuitive argument why its appearance is not surprising .",
    "the grating function , which just as in classical optics determines the peaks at the different diffraction orders , is multiplied by the molecular diffraction amplitude due to a single bar of the grating , and this is where a difference to the point - particle case may arise .",
    "we show that for a molecular diameter very small compared to the bar and slit width the deviations from the point - particle result are indeed negligible , as expected .",
    "this then verifies the interpretation of the he@xmath0 diffraction curves given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for smaller bar and slit widths",
    "noticeable deviations occur .",
    "in particular , heights of diffraction peaks may become lower than for a point particle .",
    "this can clearly be attributed to break - ups which diminish the actual number of molecules in a given direction .",
    "moreover , the decrease in peak height goes with the diffraction angle and thus with the lateral momentum transfer .",
    "this is also intuitively clear since higher momentum transfer implies more break - ups . as another effect , diffraction orders which are sometimes suppressed to zero for point particles may reappear",
    "this is probably a finite - size effect .    if the slits become much smaller than the diameter of the two - particle system , additional terms appear in the diffraction pattern .",
    "this case , however , is presently not of experimental interest and not further evaluated here .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : generaltheory ] we establish ags equations for the scattering amplitude of a bound two - particle system for scattering by an external potential .",
    "these equations decouple in our case .",
    "they can be iterated in a straightforward way , and in section [ sec : specialization ] we specialize the lowest order term to diffraction scattering . in section [ sec : evaluation ] we evaluate this for the diffraction of a weakly bound two - particle system by a transmission grating .",
    "the reader not interested in the detailed derivation can proceed directly to the main result in eqs .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) to ( [ 40 ] ) . as an illustration of our general formulae , in section",
    "[ sec : example ] diffraction patterns for he@xmath0 are determined for three slit widths and compared with the corresponding patterns for a point particle .",
    "a full discussion of the he@xmath0 case and a detailed comparison with corresponding experimental results will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we consider a bound two - particle system  designated as ( diatomic ) `` molecule ''  which is scattered by an obstacle .",
    "later we will specialize to diffraction by a transmission grating .",
    "the two particles are taken to represent two atoms whose electronic degrees of freedom are neglected .",
    "the ( molecular ) binding potential of the two particles is denoted by @xmath3 which may have several bound states , with ( negative ) binding energy @xmath4 and wave function @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the coordinates of the two particles .",
    "the obstacle ( grating ) is represented by a potential @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are short - range and strongly repulsive @xcite .    for a molecule ,",
    "as opposed to a point particle , there are various scattering channels . in the elastic channel",
    "the molecule is scattered without energy transfer , while in the inelastic channels the molecule might end up in a different bound state or might break up . in a break - up process",
    "both constituents may emerge as asymptotically free particles or one of them may stick to the obstacle if @xmath9 has an attractive part .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the problem is @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the kinetic energy , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the momentum operators of the particles , @xmath18 and @xmath19 those for the total and relative momentum , and @xmath20 and @xmath2 the total and reduced mass , respectively . for elastic and ( de-)excitation scattering the channel hamiltonian is @xmath21 .",
    "its improper eigenstates are denoted by @xmath22 , @xmath23 as in the case of one - particle scattering the @xmath24 matrix can be decomposed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the transition amplitude for an incoming molecule of momentum @xmath27 and internal state @xmath28 to an outgoing one of momentum @xmath29 and internal state @xmath30 .    in one - particle scattering",
    "the scattering amplitude can usually be determined by means of a lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation . in the present multi - channel situation",
    "there is a set of coupled ls equations , and one meets the same difficulties with them as in the three - body problem . in the latter one therefore uses the faddeev approach @xcite . for the calculation of transition",
    "amplitudes one often employs its formulation by alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the ags approach is easily carried over to the present two - body problem with its external potential .",
    "moreover , the resulting equations decouple and can be evaluated for interesting situations .",
    "this will now be outlined .",
    "we introduce the green s operators @xmath31 and similarly @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the free and @xmath34 the total resolvent .",
    "one has the usual resolvent equations @xmath35 we also define @xmath36 which are the @xmath37 matrices @xcite for the potential @xmath3 and @xmath9 , respectively , in the two - particle hilbert space .",
    "they satisfy @xmath38 which follows by writing eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) as @xmath39 and similarly for @xmath40 .    in analogy to the treatment of the three - body case in ref .",
    "@xcite we now introduce operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 through the equations @xmath43 proceeding verbatim as in section 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite one shows that the transition amplitudes of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 thus @xmath46 acts as a transition operator , and its advantage is that it satisfies a simple equation , seen as follows .",
    "we equate eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ e ] ) , @xmath47 and insert eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) for @xmath34 .",
    "this gives @xmath48 by eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) . similarly equating eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) and ( [ f ] ) and inserting eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) gives @xmath49 eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ i ] ) are the ags equations for our problem which decouple here . indeed , insertion of eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) gives @xmath50 which no longer contains @xmath51 .",
    "this is an exact equation for the transition operator and for the transition amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "break - up processes and finite - size effects are exactly included .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) one can show that @xmath52 is the transition operator for break - up processes into two asymptotically free particles .",
    "thus a knowledge of @xmath46 and @xmath51 would also cover these processes .",
    "one can further show that eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ i ] ) yield unitarity of the @xmath24 matrix .    the great advantage of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) or of the system in ( [ h ] ) and ( [ i ] ) is that it lends itself immediately to a perturbative approach by iteration .",
    "such an iterative procedure is also used in the multiple - scattering expansion in the three - body problem @xcite .",
    "to lowest order one has @xmath53 and as in ref .",
    "@xcite this is expected to give a good approximation for large incident energy , viz . for @xmath54",
    "where @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the ground - state energy and @xmath57 the ground - state wave - function .",
    "then in general the above condition also holds for other bound states .",
    "the relevant matrix elements of @xmath58 will then be small compared to the incident energy and this allows one to show that the next order term in the iteration can be neglected .",
    "thus in the region of large incident energy one has , by eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) for the transition amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath59    although @xmath40 is the transition operator for scattering of two asymptotically free particles by @xmath9 , the above matrix element differs crucially from a scattering amplitude for free particles since the wave functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not have a definite ( relative ) momentum .",
    "it is therefore through these wave functions that the above expression takes the interaction potential @xmath3 between the two particles and the finite size of the molecule into account .",
    "the major problem remaining is the explicit evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) for the transition amplitude , and this we will do here for the experimentally interesting case of diffraction by a grating and for small scattering angles .",
    "the operator @xmath62 appearing in the approximate expression for the transition amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) is , in principle , the @xmath37 matrix for the scattering of two asymptotically free particles by the potential @xmath63 .",
    "but even for this simple additive potential it is not easy to calculate @xmath64 since ( i ) it is not evaluated on the energy shell of two asymptotically free particles and ( ii ) the green s operator @xmath65 is not easily expressed by one - particle green s operators .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves in the following to the experimentally important diffraction domain and to small scattering angles .    in the diffraction domain",
    "the de broglie wave - length is , by definition , small compared to the extension of the obstacle and the potential @xcite .",
    "small scattering angles mean @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the component of @xmath29 orthogonal to the incident momentum @xmath27 . for a transmission grating of @xmath68 bars , grating period @xmath69 and slit width @xmath70 the domain of diffraction scattering can be characterized by the condition @xmath71 we also assume here and in the following that the masses @xmath72 and @xmath73 are of the same order of magnitude .    to calculate the matrix element of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) one could proceed as in the eikonal approximation @xcite by considering an absorbing ( `` black '' ) obstacle , instead of a reflecting one , and thus work with a complex _ ersatz _ potential instead of the real potential @xmath9 .",
    "we have done this , and the results agree with those of the more direct approach we are presenting here .    inserting two complete sets of two - particle plane waves in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) and performing the integration over resulting @xmath74 functions one obtains @xmath75 where for @xmath76 and @xmath77 one has to insert @xmath78 and similarly for @xmath79 .",
    "we note that the kinetic energies of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are not equal to @xmath82 so that we are not on the energy shell .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) only those values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 enter for which @xmath85 and @xmath86 are essentially different from zero",

    "( [ 20 ] ) of large incident energy ensures that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are centered at momenta which are small compared to @xmath89 since the schrdinger equation implies , upon multiplication with @xmath90 , @xmath91 therefore one has indeed @xmath92 and thus , by eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) , @xmath93 hence @xmath94 where in the last step eqs . ( [ g ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) have been used .",

    "<S> atomic diffraction through double slits and transmission gratings is well described in terms of the associated de broglie waves and classical wave optics . however , for weakly bound and relatively large systems , such as the he@xmath0 dimer , this might no longer hold true due to the possibility of break - up processes and finite - size effects . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore study the diffraction of weakly bound two - particle systems . </S>",
    "<S> if the bar and slit widths of the grating are much larger than the diameter of the two - particle system we recover the usual optics results . for smaller widths , however , </S>",
    "<S> deviations therefrom occur . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the location of possible diffraction peaks is indeed still governed by the usual grating function from optics , but the peaks may have a lower intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this is not unexpected when break - up processes are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> more unusually though , diffraction peaks which would be absent for de broglie waves may reappear . </S>",
