    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , those objects with 1 - 1000@xmath1 m luminosities in excess of @xmath15 ) were first discovered in the 1970s @xcite . since then , they have fascinated astronomers with their unique and extraordinary properties , and infuriated them with their singularly opaque natures , almost in equal measure .    in the local universe ulirgs are a rare , if interesting oddity , with only fifty or so examples known at @xmath16 .",
    "first uncovered in significant numbers by surveys with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras , @xcite ) , work focused on determining the power source behind their colossal infrared emission .",
    "this initially provoked heated debate between a starburst camp and an agn camp , a debate that has not yet entirely cooled .",
    "early studies showed that some ulirg optical spectra resembled those of starburst galaxies @xcite , whereas others contained emission lines characteristic of seyferts @xcite .",
    "radio observations showed direct evidence for starbursts in some ulirgs @xcite and agn in others @xcite . over the last decade or so however a consensus has started to emerge ; local ulirgs are likely to be ` composite ' objects , with most powered mainly by a starburst , but with a significant fraction also containing an ir - luminous agn .",
    "this is suggested from several lines of evidence , including optical / uv spectroscopy @xcite , mid - infared spectroscopy @xcite , modelling of their 1 - 1000@xmath1 m spectral energy distributions @xcite , and x - ray observations @xcite , though some recent studies suggest a significantly greater average agn contribution @xcite .",
    "local ulirgs are also associated almost exclusively with galaxy mergers @xcite , and may be involved to some degree in triggering qsos @xcite .",
    "excellent reviews of the properties of ulirgs can be found in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "their rarity in the local universe compared to lower luminosity systems initially led astronomers to believe that ulirgs did not play a fundamental role in galaxy formation processes , however this perception changed abruptly when it was realised that ulirgs were vastly more numerous at high redshift .",
    "first hinted at by spectroscopic followup of iras surveys @xcite , which showed strong evolution in the ulirg luminosity function with redshift , and from the discovery of a remarkably high cosmic infrared background by cobe @xcite , this was confirmed by surveys with iso @xcite , which found a large population of ulirgs up to @xmath17 , and thrown into sharp relief by sub - mm surveys @xcite , which showed that there were several hundred ulirgs _ per square degree _ at @xmath18 .",
    "though obviously much harder to study , these distant ulirgs seem superficially similar to their low redshift counterparts in that they appear to be powered by both starburst and agn activity @xcite , and are probably mergers @xcite .",
    "their properties may make them important tools in understanding the global evolution of galaxies and large - scale structures ; their rapid star formation rates and comoving number densities make them strong candidates for being the rapid growth phases of massive elliptical galaxies @xcite , and they may serve as efficient ` lighthouses ' of the seeds of massive clusters at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the still controversial nature of the power source in local ulirgs , coupled with the central position that ulirgs seem to play in several astrophysical processes at high redshift , makes it ever more important to understand the nature of the heavily obscured starburst and agn activity in these systems .",
    "this is ideally done in the mid - infrared , directly sampling the emission from the hot dust that shrouds the central engines of ulirgs , and using fine - structure lines , which suffer much less from extinction effects than optical or near - ir lines .",
    "the recently launched _",
    "space telescope @xcite provides an ideal platform to undertake such studies , with its suite of mid - ir instruments , including the infrared spectrograph @xcite , which offers dramatic improvements in sensitivity and resolution compared to previous generation facilities . in this paper , we present high resolution mid - infrared spectra of 53 local ulirgs , and discuss some spectral diagnostics based on their emission line fluxes and other spectral features .",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the ulirgs presented here were observed as part of a large study within the irs gto program to obtain mid - infrared spectra of 110 low redshift ulirgs ( spitzer program i d 105 ) .",
    "these 110 ulirgs were selected from the iras 1jy @xcite and 2jy @xcite spectroscopic surveys , and from the first ulirg sample @xcite .",
    "low resolution spectra were obtained of all 110 objects , and high resolution spectra were obtained of the 53 brightest ( at 60@xmath1 m , those with @xmath24jy ) objects . the low resolution spectra span 5.2@xmath1 m - 38.5@xmath1 m , with a resolution of r@xmath25 .",
    "initial results are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen masses are presented in @xcite , and crystalline silicate measurements are presented in @xcite .",
    "an atlas of the low resolution spectra can be found in @xcite , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) luminosities and equivalent widths .",
    "measurements of the strengths of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption features from the low resolution spectra can be found in @xcite .    here , we present the 53 high resolution spectra .",
    "the sample is listed in table [ sample ] .",
    "a few of the sample have ir luminosities that lie slightly below the canonical ulirg lower limit of 10@xmath26l@xmath27 , but for simplicity we refer to them as ulirgs for the remainder of this paper .",
    "each ulirg was observed with both the short - high ( sh , 9.9@xmath1 m - 19.6@xmath1 m , @xmath28 , r@xmath29 , 2.3  pix@xmath21 ) and long - high ( lh , 18.7@xmath1 m - 37.2@xmath1 m , @xmath30 , r@xmath29 , 4.5  pix@xmath21 ) modules onboard the irs .",
    "the targets were placed in the center of each slit by performing high accuracy peak - ups using the blue peak - up array , on either a nearby 2mass star or on the nuclei of the ulirgs themselves , and observed in two nod positions . for five ulirgs ,",
    "their nuclei are separated by distances of @xmath65  or more ; for iras 08572 + 3915 the slits were centered on the north - western nucleus , for iras 14348 - 1447 the slits were centered on the south - western nucleus , for iras 19254 - 7245 the slits were centered on the southern nucleus , for iras 23498 + 2423 the slits were centered on the north - western nucleus , and for mrk 463 the slits were centered on the eastern nucleus .",
    "the other ulirgs are all either single - nucleus ( in ground - based imaging ) systems , or have close separation ( @xmath315@xmath32 ) double nuclei . while the available optical spectroscopy for our sample is not homogenous , there are no examples of objects in our sample where two nuclei with clearly different optical spectral classifications fall within the irs slits .    for most of the sh observations we observed each object for 6 ramps , with a ramp time of 30s , to give a total on - source exposure time of 180s . for the fainter targets we observed for two ramps using a ramp time of 120s , for a total on - source exposure time of 240s .",
    "the lh observations were the same for each object ; namely 4 ramps and a ramp time of 60s , for a total on - source exposure time of 240s within the _ leopard _",
    "software , available from the spitzer science center ] .",
    "the data were processed through the _ spitzer _",
    "science center s pipeline reduction software ( version 13.2 ) , which performs standard reduction tasks such as ramp fitting and dark current subtraction . to ensure an accurate flatfielding correction we started our reduction from the _ un_flatfielded ( _ droopres _ ) images .",
    "starting with these frames , we flagged rogue and otherwise ` bad ' pixels using the _",
    "tool , which uses a mask of rogue pixels for each campaign to first flag and then replace rogue pixels .",
    "the individual frames were then combined into a single image , and spectra were extracted from each nod using the smart software package @xcite , using full - slit extraction . wavelength and flux calibration were performed by dividing the extracted spectra by that of a standard star , @xmath33dra , and multiplying by its template @xcite .",
    "features present in only one nod position were treated as artifacts and removed manually .",
    "the two nods were then combined .",
    "the pixels on the edge of each order ( typically the first and last 12 pixels ) corresponding to regions of decreased sensitivity on the array were then removed to give the final spectrum for each object .",
    "the resulting spectra were generally of excellent quality .",
    "in a few cases some slight mismatch in continuum fluxes between orders was apparent , but not to an extent that could impact the analysis of emission line fluxes .",
    "both the sh and lh slits are too small to allow for on - slit background subtraction . ideally the sky continuum background ( which is comprised mainly of temporally and spatially varying zodiacal light )",
    "should be subtracted using contemporaneous ` sky ' observations , taken with similar exposure times and as close on the sky as possible to the observations of the target .",
    "such observations were however not taken for our sample . in the absence of sky observations , modelled",
    "sky fluxes can be used @xcite , but they are uncertain by at least a factor of two . in this paper",
    "we are interested only in the emission line fluxes , for which background continuum subtraction is not necessary .",
    "hence , we do not correct our spectra for contamination from sky continuum background .",
    "we measured line fluxes and wavelengths by assuming the emitting region was a point source at the spatial resolution of the sh and lh slits , subtracting the continuum via a cubic spline fit over a @xmath34 m region centered on each line , and then fitting a single gaussian profile to each line .",
    "we found a pure gaussian profile to be a good fit to the lines in virtually all cases .",
    "the resulting 3@xmath35 uncertainties in the wavelengths are themselves a function of wavelength , and are typically 0.01@xmath1 m at 10@xmath1 m , 0.03@xmath1 m at 20@xmath1 m , and 0.04@xmath1 m at 30@xmath1 m .",
    "blended lines were measured by simultaneously fitting multiple gaussians to the combined profile .",
    "upper limits were determined by measuring the noise level of the data at the wavelength where the line is expected to lie ; this can give rise to significant variations in upper limits for different lines in the same source if the wavelength of a line lies in an order overlap region .",
    "previous authors have generally used either near - ir line ratios , or the [ siii]@xmath3618.713,33.481 line ratio to derive an extinction correction ( e.g. @xcite ) , however we only detect both [ siii ] lines in a small fraction of our sample , and the available near - ir spectroscopy for our sample is heterogenous and incomplete . given this , and the uncertain structure of the narrow - line emitting gas in the mid - ir , we have chosen not to correct our line fluxes for extinction .",
    "we can however estimate what effect this lack of an extinction correction will have on our analysis .",
    "the relationship between the intrinsic and observed flux ratio for a pair of emission lines at wavelengths @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be written :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the extinctions at the wavelengths of the pair of lines and in the rest - frame @xmath43 band , respectively . assuming @xmath44 , and obtaining values for @xmath45 from a standard extinction law @xcite then allows us to estimate the effect on a line ratio in terms of an increase in the @xmath43 band extinction . using this formalism , we find that the effect on most line ratios if @xmath42 is increased is small .",
    "for example , for the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio we obtain :    @xmath46}{[neii]}\\right)_{int } = \\left (   \\frac{[neiii]}{[neii]}\\right)_{obs}\\times10^{\\left ( -7.34\\times10^{-4 } \\right)a_{v } } \\ ] ]    which is negligible unless the increase in @xmath42 is at least a few tens . hence our lack of an extinction correction , while important to be aware of , should not unduly affect our analysis of most line ratios , though the effect of a lack of an extinction correction on line luminosities is more significant .",
    "we discuss the effects of extinction in terms of an increase in @xmath42 for both fine structure line ratios and luminosities in the following sections .",
    "finally , we note that the magnitude , and in some cases the direction , of the effect on a line ratio for an increase in extinction depend significantly on ones choice of extinction law . in table",
    "[ extinctlaws ] we present the scaling factors for several line ratios for an increase in @xmath42 , assuming some commonly used extinction laws . for a given line ratio",
    "there is broad consistency between the extinction laws , but differences of up to @xmath47 between the scaling factors are common .",
    "these differences in scaling factors between extinction laws should be kept in mind in the following sections .",
    "the sh spectra are presented in figures [ sh_figa ] to [ sh_fige ] , and the lh spectra are presented in figures [ lh_figa ] to [ lh_fige ] .      all of the spectra show various fine structure emission lines of neon , oxygen , sulfur , silicon and ( depending on redshift ) argon . also present are molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "these lines are listed in table [ linefluxa ] .",
    "we detect [ neii]@xmath712.81 and [ neiii]@xmath715.56 in nearly every object .",
    "[ siii]@xmath718.71 is also common , detected in @xmath680% of the sample , and [ siv]@xmath710.51 is detected in just under half of the sample .",
    "the detection of [ siii]@xmath733.48 is dependent on redshift , requiring @xmath48 ( for the line to lie at @xmath49 m in the observed frame ) , but is detected in @xmath680% of the objects where this line lies within the lh bandpass .",
    "other lines whose detection is dependent on redshift include [ arii]@xmath78.99 , which is detected in the majority of objects at @xmath50 , and [ siii]@xmath734.82 , which is seen in about half of the objects at @xmath51 ( though this line lies in a noisy lh order even at @xmath52 and thus is hard to detect ) .",
    "three higher ionization lines are also present , though less commonly than the lines discussed above ; [ nev]@xmath714.32 and/or [ oiv]@xmath725.89 are detected in just under half the sample , while [ nev]@xmath724.32 is detected in about one third of the sample . turning to molecular hydrogen lines ; the s(3 ) , s(2 ) and s(1 ) pure rotational transitions of h@xmath3 are seen in nearly all of the sample , while the s(0 ) h@xmath3 transition is seen in about one third of the sample , though its rarity compared to the other molecular hydrogen lines is probably as much to do with the rising continuum towards longer wavelengths as anything else .",
    "our line fluxes are in all cases consistent with those in @xcite and @xcite , though we use a more recent version of the irs pipeline .",
    "the fluxes reported here should therefore be more accurate than those previously published .",
    "in addition to fine - structure ( and other ) emission features , some objects show one or more absorption features .",
    "the focus of this paper is the fine - structure emission lines , so here we only briefly mention these features , deferring a full discussion to later work .",
    "several objects show two absorption features , corresponding to the vibration - rotation absorption bands of @xmath53 at 13.70@xmath1 m and hcn at 14.02@xmath1 m .",
    "an extensive discussion of these features can be found in @xcite .",
    "a total of ten objects , most prominently arp 220 , iras 15250 + 3609 and iras 20551 - 4250 , show an oh absorption feature at @xmath634.6@xmath1 m ( iras 15250 + 3609 may also show a further oh absorption feature at rest - frame 28.9@xmath1 m , though the significance of detection is weak ) .",
    "this feature is most likely the @xmath54 oh absorption doublet , which is thought to pump the 1667mhz oh maser line , among others @xcite .",
    "this absorption feature has been seen previously in galactic sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , ngc 253 @xcite , and arp 220 @xcite .",
    "the prominence of this feature in arp 220 is consistent with the presence of an oh megamaser in this source @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lines discussed in the previous section , we also see a variety of ` rare ' ( which we arbitrarily define as appearing in ten or fewer objects ) emission features in several objects , listed in table [ linefluxc ] .",
    "we detect [ clii]@xmath714.37 in six objects , four of which also show [ nev]@xmath714.32 , leading to a double - peaked profile ( see also @xcite ) . in the other two objects",
    "only one peak is seen , and it is possible that we have confused [ clii]@xmath714.37 with [ nev]@xmath714.32 , however the velocity shift relative to the systemic ( optical ) redshift would have to be @xmath55 km s@xmath21 for this to be the case .",
    "we therefore regard [ clii]@xmath714.37 as the more likely identification .",
    "this line is seen in some lower luminosity starbursts @xcite , but is rare in agn @xcite .",
    "a number of low - ionization iron lines are present , including [ feii]@xmath5617.94,24.52,25.99 and [ feiii]@xmath722.93 , all of which are seen ( rarely ) in lower luminosity starbursts and agn .",
    "we tentatively detect [ piii]@xmath717.89 in two objects .",
    "this line is seen in small numbers of local ir - luminous sources , and in a variety of galactic sources . also present",
    "is the [ arv]@xmath713.10 line , which is occasionally seen in agn @xcite . one object , arp220 , shows a weak detection of what is plausibly [ neiii]@xmath736.01 , though arp220 is the only object in our sample at a low enough redshift for this line to enter a well behaved part of the lh bandpass .",
    "we weakly detect the hi 7 - 6 line ( i.e. the alpha transition of the humphreys atomic hydrogen series ) in four objects . finally , two objects show features that appear to be real , but proved difficult to identify reliably , hence we have not listed them in table [ linefluxc ] . iras 23498",
    "+ 2423 shows a feature at a rest - frame wavelength of 10.581@xmath1 m with a flux of 3.17@xmath57 w @xmath58 .",
    "this feature is clearly resolved from the [ siv]@xmath710.511 line .",
    "if this feature is real , then possibilities include [ coii]@xmath710.521 , which is seen in the 200 day - 500 day mid - ir spectra of core collapse supernovae @xcite , or [ niii]@xmath710.682 .",
    "iras 19297 - 0406 shows an emission feature with a flux of 3.88@xmath59 w @xmath58 that can plausibly be identified as the 31.77@xmath1 m water ice emission feature .",
    "mid - ir fine structure lines can be used to study three properties of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) gas ; excitation , electron temperature and electron density .",
    "measuring electron temperature though requires combining a mid - ir line with an optical or near - ir line of the same species . in this paper",
    ", we therefore concentrate only on electron density and excitation .",
    "the electron density in a nlr can be estimated by using the ratios of two lines representing transitions from the same orbital and suborbital ( i.e. the same principal and angular momentum quantum numbers ) , but with different numbers of electrons in that ( sub)orbital . for our sample",
    "there are two line ratios that satisfy this requirement ; the @xmath60 and @xmath61 transitions of [ nev ] at 14.32@xmath1 m and 24.32@xmath1 m , and the @xmath60 and @xmath61 transitions of [ siii ] at 18.71@xmath1 m and 33.48@xmath1 m .",
    "these ratios can then be converted to an electron density by solving the relevant rate equation .",
    "of the two , the [ nev ] ratio is more useful .",
    "its high ionization potential of 97ev means that it can only be produced ( at a level observable in a ulirg ) by an agn , making it more straightforward to interpret than the [ siii ] ratio .",
    "furthermore , for most extinction laws the extinctions of the two [ nev ] lines are virtualy identical ( table [ extinctlaws ] , see also @xcite ) , making the [ nev ] ratio only marginally sensitive to the lack of an extinction correction .",
    "sixteen of the ulirgs in our sample show detections in both [ nev ] lines .",
    "the line ratios for these objects span the range 0.57 @xmath62 [ nev]@xmath714.32/[nev]@xmath724.32 @xmath62 2.69 , with a fairly even spread .",
    "the nine objects that are only detected in [ nev]@xmath714.32 have lower limits on the [ nev ] line ratio consistent with this range . using figure 3 of @xcite , then these [ nev ] line ratios are consistent with electron densities of @xmath63 @xmath64 in all cases , well below the critical densities of the two lines .",
    "our derived electron densities are also comparable to those derived ( using the same [ nev ] ratio ) for lower luminosity agn @xcite . as a check",
    ", we examine the [ siii ] line ratio ; for those objects with detections in both lines we see a range of 0.14 @xmath62 [ siii]@xmath718.71/[siii]@xmath733.48 @xmath62 1.10 , consistent with electron densities of @xmath65@xmath64 .",
    "it is important to note however that we expect the [ nev ] and [ siii ] line ratios to give different electron densities , because the [ nev ] lines are likely produced solely by the agn , while the [ siii ] lines ( probably ) arise from both starburst and agn heated regions .      if electron densities are below the critical density , then the excitation level of the nlr can be estimated by considering flux ratios of adjacent ionization states of the same element , e.g. for an element @xmath66 ; @xmath67 . for a fixed number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom ( i.e. a given ionization parameter @xmath68 ) , this ratio will be approximately proportional to the number of photons producing the observed @xmath69 flux relative to the number of lyman continuum photons , though if @xmath68 varies then @xmath67 will also vary . therefore , for a fixed @xmath68 , a higher value of @xmath67 indicates a harder radiation field , though the details depend on the element in question .",
    "our spectra contain a limited number of lines , hence detailed excitation diagnostics are not possible .",
    "we can however get a qualitative idea of the range in excitations in our sample .",
    "the two most useful diagnostic ratios are [ neiii]@xmath715.56/[neii]@xmath712.81 and [ siv]@xmath710.51/[siii]@xmath718.71 .",
    "both neon and sulfur are abundant in galactic sources , with both [ ne / h ] and [ s / h ] lying approximately in the range @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the photon energies required to produce any of these four ions are @xmath71ev , meaning that they can all be produced in star - forming regions as well as agn .",
    "all four lines are seen in wolf - rayet star spectra @xcite , hii regions @xcite , planetary nebulae @xcite , as well as the integrated spectra of local galaxies .",
    "we might also expect [ neiii ] and [ siv ] to increase in strength relative to [ neii ] and [ siii ] in lower density and/or lower metallicity star forming regions @xcite .",
    "it is however strange , given their similar ionization energies , that we detect [ neiii]@xmath715.56 in virtually all the sample , but only detect [ siv]@xmath710.51 in about 45% of the sample .",
    "the [ siv]@xmath710.51 line lies close to the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate feature , but we detect the h@xmath3,s(3)@xmath79.66 line in most of our sample , in many cases with a flux that is lower than the upper limit on the [ siv]@xmath710.51 line .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is that the neon and sulfur emitting zones in ulirgs lie within regions extincted by silicate dust , while the h@xmath3 emitting region lies outside it ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by the fact that we do not detect [ siv]@xmath710.51 in any object which has a silicate strength @xcite greater than 2.1 ( see @xcite for the silicate strengths of our sample ) .    in figure",
    "[ excite ] we plot an ` excitation plane ' of [ neiii]/[neii ] vs [ siv]/[siii ] for our sample .",
    "the ulirgs span a broad range in excitation , but with a positive correlation between the sulfur and neon line ratios , suggesting that we are seeing emission from the same region in both species . a similar correlation has previously been noted for blue compact dwarf galaxies @xcite , and for nearby infrared - faint galaxies @xcite . the ulirgs are fairly evenly distributed across the correlation region , with no obvious over- or underpopulated regions .    also plotted in figure [ excite ] are data for starbursts and agn with ir luminosities ( mostly ) between @xmath72l@xmath27 and @xmath73l@xmath27 @xcite , and the relations from figure 4 of @xcite for star forming regions and ir - faint agn , the bulk of which have ir luminosities below @xmath72l@xmath27 .",
    "the ulirgs occupy the same region in the ionization plane as the @xcite and @xcite starburst and agn samples . barring some particularly subtle bias from a lack of extinction correction ,",
    "this suggests that the mid - ir emitting narrow line region gas in ulirgs is excited in broadly the same way as the nlr in @xmath74 l@xmath10(l@xmath27 ) @xmath75 starbursts and agn , and that any differences in density , metallicity or star formation history between ulirgs and lower luminosity systems are not sufficient to manifest themselves in simple ionization plane diagrams .",
    "the same does not however appear to be true for systems with l@xmath76l@xmath27 .",
    "the ulirgs are consistent with the slopes of the @xcite relations , but are offset below them by @xmath60.2 dex . increased extinction in the form of a foreground screen could explain this , but would require an additional @xmath77 of foreground extinction ( and see also table [ extinctlaws ] ) .",
    "an ( arguably ) more likely explanation is that there is a decrease in the intrinsic [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio for a given [ siv]/[siii ] ratio in going from l@xmath78l@xmath27 starbursts to l@xmath79l@xmath27 systems .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate this effect in detail , so here we simply suggest a possible explanation . from table",
    "[ linefluxa ] , [ siv ] has a significantly smaller ionization energy than [ neiii ] , and the difference in ionization energies between [ siv ] and [ siii ] is smaller than the difference between [ neiii ] and [ neii ] .",
    "this means that , if we increase the gas density in the nlr or decrease the hardness of the ionizing radiation then both the [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ siv]/[siii ] ratios will decrease , but the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio will decrease by a larger fraction than the [ siv]/[siii ] ratio . as we might expect the gas density in the nlr of ulirgs to be significantly higher than in l@xmath76l@xmath27 star forming regions",
    ", we might also expect a smaller [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio in ulirgs for a given [ siv]/[siii ] ratio than in lower luminosity starbursts .",
    "a softer ionizing radiation field in ulirgs compared to lower luminosity starbursts would produce a similar effect .",
    "we can also explore variations in excitation as a function of the total emission . in figure [ excitelum ]",
    "we plot the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio against infrared ( rest - frame @xmath80 m ) luminosity .",
    "there is no discernible correlation .",
    "two ulirgs , mrk 463e and 3c 273 , have elevated [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios ( though with very different ir luminosities ) , while the rest of the sample is confined to [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios in the range 0.08 - 1.05 , irrespective of their ir luminosity .",
    "this picture remains broadly the same if we substitute ir luminosity for radio luminosity ( figure [ excitelum2 ] ) . in this case , objects with 1.4ghz luminosities lower than @xmath81w show no discernible correlation between radio luminosity and [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "those objects with higher radio luminosities appear to be confined to higher [ neiii]/[neii ] ratios , and with a narrower spread , though the number of objects with l@xmath82w is too small to draw firm conclusions .",
    "we conclude therefore that neither 1 - 1000@xmath1 m luminosity or @xmath83ghz luminosity are good proxies for the excitation of the nlr in ulirgs .",
    "mid - ir emission from galaxies can arise from five sources ; ( 1 ) a non - thermal component , e.g. supernova remnants , ( 2 ) photospheres of evolved stars , ( 3 ) ionized gas , ( 4 ) dust grains , and ( 5 ) molecular gas . in most ulirgs",
    "the latter three sources dominate the mid - ir emission .",
    "the ionized gas gives rise to the fine structure lines , while the smaller dust grains produce the mid - ir continuum longward of about 10@xmath1 m .",
    "larger dust grains give rise to features such as the absorption features at 9.7@xmath1 m and 18@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "large molecules give rise to several emission and absorption features ; the most prominent emission features are seen from 3.3@xmath1 m to about 19@xmath1 m and arise from bending and stretching modes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "other molecular features include several hydrogen emission lines , as well as weaker features such as co , hcn and c@xmath3h@xmath3 gas absorption @xcite .",
    "the use of these mid - ir emission and absorption features as diagnostics of the power source in ulirgs is however not straightforward .",
    "the fundamental problem is that dust and gas simply require a source of ionizing radiation to emit in the mid - ir , and do not particularly care what the source of that ionizing radiation is . in principle , a population of hot stars or an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole both serve equally well .",
    "exhaustive reviews of these difficulties are given elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) , so here we highlight some examples .",
    "fine structure line fluxes are affected by several factors , particularly in starbursts , where the age of the burst , the geometry of the region and the upper and lower bounds on the imf can all have a drastic effect on observed line ratios ( e.g. fig 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "the factors determining pah strengths are still poorly understood ; one factor that is known to have a significant effect is metallicity , with strong suppression of pahs seen in low metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "there is also no _ a priori _ reason why pah bending and stretching modes can not be excited by an agn , although observationally pahs seem to be almost exclusively associated with either star forming regions or ambient interstellar light @xcite .",
    "significant silicate absorption on the other hand merely requires a mass of warm dust obscured by a significant column of cooler dust , and therefore on its own says nothing about what is heating the warm dust .    with these subleties in mind",
    ", we examine the nature of the starburst and agn activity in our sample .",
    "we focus here on a limited number of diagnostics , deferring detailed analysis to upcoming papers .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that the total luminosity of the [ neii]@xmath712.81 and [ neiii]@xmath715.56 lines are a diagnostic of star formation rates in galaxies across a wide range in ir luminosity .",
    "this method potentially offers a number of advantages over other mid - ir star formation diagnostics ; the neon lines in question are strong and easily observed , and the dependence on an accurate extinction correction is small . with ulirgs however , there is the obvious caveat that some or all of the [ neii]@xmath712.81 and [ neiii]@xmath715.56 may originate in regions excited by an agn rather than a starburst , so in this section we explore the use of the [ neii]@xmath712.81 and [ neiii]@xmath715.56 lines as star formation rate diagnostics in our sample .",
    "in figure [ hoketo ] we plot the [ neiii]+[neii ] luminosities of our sample against total ir luminosity , and overplot the relation given in equation 2 of @xcite .",
    "there is a large scatter in the [ neiii]+[neii ] luminosities as a function of ir luminosity for our sample , comparable to the scatter seen in figure 1 of @xcite , but we see a clear upward trend in [ neiii]+[neii ] luminosity with increasing ir luminosity .",
    "a power law fit yields @xmath84 , and a horizontal line fit ( i.e. no dependence of [ neiii]+[neii ] luminosity on ir luminosity ) is ruled out at @xmath85 significance .",
    "the slope of the relation for the ulirgs is consistent with the slope of the ho & keto relation plotted in figure [ hoketo ] , but the ulirgs are systematically lower , offset by @xmath86 dex , on average .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this offset .",
    "first is that an agn is contributing to the total ir luminosity but not to the neon line fluxes , however this explanation seems unlikely , as we see systems with known ir - luminous agn scattered on either side of the ho & keto line ; mrk 463e and ngc 6240 both lie above it , whereas mrk 231 and iras 03158 + 4227 ( which contains a compton - thick agn , @xcite ) both lie well below it .",
    "second is a different electron density in the nlr of ulirgs ; either significantly lower than that seen in lower luminosity starbursts , or much higher and approaching the critical density .",
    "a high electron density however is ruled out ( see  [ elecdens ] ) , and there is no evidence for electron densities substantially lower than in lower luminosity systems .",
    "a significantly lower metallicity would also serve to lower neon luminosities for a given ir luminosity , but again there is no evidence ( or indeed plausible motivation ) for such low metallicities in local ulirgs .",
    "finally , this offset could be caused by higher extinction .",
    "this explanation seems the most likely .",
    "though the ho & keto relation was derived without correcting for extinction , we expect ulirgs to suffer heavier extinction in their nuclear regions relative to lower luminosity starbursts .",
    "the offset seen for ulirgs corresponds to @xmath87 over and above the extinction seen in lower luminosity systems .",
    "the correlation between [ neiii]@xmath715.56 + [ neii]@xmath712.81 luminosity and ir luminosity is consistent with the idea that there is a correlation between [ neiii]@xmath715.56 + [ neii]@xmath712.81 luminosity and star formation rate in ulirgs .",
    "this on its own however does not support such a hypothesis , as we expect the luminosity of any mid - ir fine - structure line to correlate approximately with the mid - ir luminosity of the ionizing souce , irrespective of what that source may be .",
    "therefore , to test this hypothesis further , we examine the relationship between [ neiii]@xmath715.56 + [ neii]@xmath712.81 luminosity and the luminosity of pah features .    the origin of pah features and their use as star formation indicators are still controversial ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observationally however , pah features are usually prominent in starburst galaxies , with previous authors noting a good correlation between the strength of pah features and ir luminosity in starbursts @xcite , but appear to be weak or absent in agn @xcite .",
    "the cause of this dichotomy is thought to be a combination of two factors .",
    "first , the uv radiation field from an accretion disk around a black hole is harder than the uv radiation field from a starburst , and is therefore more adept at destroying the c - h and c - c bonds in pahs .",
    "second , a luminous agn produces a prominent mid - ir continuum which can drown out pah features , even if there is a vigorous starburst present @xcite .",
    "even though there is good evidence that pahs originate in star forming regions , the behaviour of individual pah features as a function of star formation rate remains uncertain , with strong variations observed in individual pah feature strengths between different starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , we elect to use the combined luminosities of two pah features in order to reduce the likely scatter introduced by variances in individual pah strengths . the choice of the two pah features is a straightforward one ; the most luminous pah features are those at 6.2@xmath1 m , 7.7@xmath1 m and 11.2@xmath1 m , but the 7.7@xmath1 m feature is difficult to measure as it lies in a crowded part of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , even though the 11.2@xmath1 m feature can be significantly affected by silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath1 m , we use the luminosities of the pah 6.2@xmath1 m and 11.2@xmath1 m features .",
    "these pah luminosities are measured from the low resolution irs spectra presented in @xcite . for the 11.2@xmath1 m pah feature the luminosity was measured by integrating over 10.8@xmath1 m - 11.8@xmath1 m in the continuum - subtracted spectra , with the equivalent width evaluated at 11.25@xmath1 m .",
    "the relevant parameters for the 6.2@xmath1 m pah feature were 5.90@xmath1 m - 6.55@xmath1 m and 6.22@xmath1 m , respectively .    in figure [ hoketoalt ]",
    "we plot [ neiii]+[neii ] luminosity against the combined luminosities of the pah 6.2@xmath1 m and 11.2@xmath1 m featuresm luminosity or the 11.2@xmath1 m luminosity yield plots with significantly greater scatter ] .",
    "the neon line luminosities and pah luminosities clearly track each other , lending support to the idea that , on average , lower ionization neon lines originate in regions heated mostly by star formation .",
    "a power law fit yields :    @xmath88    where l@xmath89 and l@xmath90 are the [ neiii]+[neii ] and 6.2@xmath1m+11.2@xmath1 m luminosities ( in any units , as long as they are both the same ) , respectively . equation [ neopah ] is solely intended to indicate the trend , and evidently is not a good physical model for the data .",
    "it is notable however that the scaling between [ neiii]+[neii ] luminosity and pah 6.2@xmath1m+11.2@xmath1 m luminosity predicted from this fit is , to within the error on the exponent of @xmath91 , linear .",
    "interestingly , we see a comparable slope ( though different normalization ) if we instead plot [ siii]@xmath92 luminosity against pah 6.2@xmath1m+11.2@xmath1 m luminosity .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the sizes of the lower ionization neon and sulfur emiting regions , and pah emitting regions in ulirgs scale linearly with each other with increasing luminosity , though a luminosity dependence on metallicity and/or electron density could also play a role .",
    "it is also straightforward to derive a relation between pah 6.2@xmath1m+11.2@xmath1 m luminosity and star formation rate , using equation 12 from @xcite combined with equation [ neopah ] . in doing so",
    "however , we use the updated conversion between lyman continuum flux and star formation rate given by @xcite , rather than the relation in @xcite . by combining equation 12 from @xcite with the relations between lyman continuum flux and star formation rate given in  2.1 of @xcite",
    ", we obtain :    @xmath93 = 2.69\\times10^{-41}\\frac{l_{n } [ ergs\\ s^{-1}]}{f_{ion}(f_{ne^{+ } } + 1.67f_{ne^{++}})}\\ ] ]    where sfr is the star formation rate , @xmath94 is the combined luminosity of the two neon lines , @xmath95 is the fraction of photons that actually contribute to ionizing the gas , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the fractional abundances of [ neii ] and [ neiii ] , respectively . for ulirgs however there is an additional complication .",
    "the conversion in @xcite assumes continuous star formation over @xmath98 years .",
    "star formation in ulirgs however is likely to occur in some form of ` burst ' over timescales of @xmath99 years .",
    "this means that the star formation rates in ulirgs will be underestimated by a significant amount if the conversion in equation [ bigeqn ] is used unmodified . following previous work @xcite",
    ", we adopt an _ approximate _",
    "upward scaling of 50% to correct for this difference .",
    "this scaling is likely to be sufficient for considering trends , but should be adjusted for specific objects where the age and nature of the burst are known . assuming this scaling , plus linear scaling between neon and pah luminosity , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xcite , we arrive at :    @xmath103 = 1.18\\times10^{-41}l_{p } [ ergs\\ s^{-1}]\\label{pahstar}\\ ] ]    where @xmath91 is in units of ergs s@xmath21 .",
    "this assumes solar metallicity and a salpeter imf spanning 0.1m@xmath27 to 100m@xmath27 , and is only applicable to objects where the pah and neon luminosities arise from recent star formation .",
    "the errors on the star formation rates derived using equation [ pahstar ] are difficult to quantify .",
    "the conversion from ly@xmath104 continuum flux to star formation rate has an error of @xmath630@xmath105 @xcite , and there is a significant extra error introduced by the scatter in figure [ hoketoalt ] .",
    "we therefore estimate that the errors on star formation rates derived using equation [ pahstar ] are of order 30% for population studies , rising to at least 50% for individual objects .",
    "equation [ pahstar ] does however offer the advantage that it does not require an accurate measure of the rest - frame 1 - 1000@xmath1 m luminosity , and hence is particularly suited to population studies at high redshifts .",
    "equation [ pahstar ] also gives plausible star formation rates for our sample .",
    "we defer a complete analysis to an upcoming paper , but note that for arp 220 and using the pah luminosities in @xcite , equation [ pahstar ] gives a star formation rate of 57m@xmath27 yr@xmath21 , which is consistent with the total star formation rate inferred from radio observations , which give 50 - 100m@xmath27 yr@xmath21 ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .      to distinguish between starburst and agn power behind the 1 - 1000@xmath1 m emission in ulirgs , we need diagnostics that are sensitive to the observable differences between young stars , and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole . for our purposes , there are two such differences .",
    "first , the ionizing radiation from an agn is harder and ( potentially ) more intense than that from a starburst .",
    "second , agn occupy a smaller volume , @xmath106pc , as opposed to a few tens to a few hundreds of pc for a starburst . in principle",
    "therefore , we might expect the averaged mid - ir spectra of agn to exhibit three differences compared to those of starbursts ; higher ionization fine structure lines , increased quantities of ` hot ' ( @xmath107k ) dust , and ( potentially ) increased obscuration .",
    "we explore each of these differences in this section .",
    "we start with the simplest possible diagnostic ; the detection ( or otherwise ) of individual lines . for examining starburst and agn activity , the [ nev]@xmath714.32 and [ oiv]@xmath725.89 lines are the most useful single line diagnostics",
    ". both lines can be strong in planetary nebulae and young supernova remnants @xcite , and [ oiv ] is sometimes seen in w - r star spectra .",
    "both lines are however weak in spectra of star forming regions ( e.g. @xcite ) , while being strong in spectra of agn . as [ nev]@xmath714.32 has @xmath108 ev , compared to 54.9ev for [ oiv]@xmath725.89 , and because models indicate that [ nev]@xmath714.32 is unlikely to be strong in galaxies without an agn @xcite , we focus most of our attention on the [ nev]@xmath714.32 line .    the presence of [ nev]@xmath714.32 can not provide meaningful constraints on the bolometric luminosity of an agn , simply becase a comparable [ nev]@xmath714.32 flux can be produced by a faint agn with low obscuration , or a luminous agn with high obscuration . from table",
    "[ linefluxa ] however we can see that [ nev]@xmath714.32 is detected in 22 out of 53 objects , providing direct spectroscopic evidence for an agn in these 22 objects .",
    "our sample is flux- rather than volume - limited , hence we can not draw firm conclusions about local ulirgs as a whole , however this suggests that an agn provides a non - negligible fraction of the mid - ir flux in @xmath109% of local ulirgs .",
    "this is significantly higher than the fraction of ulirgs that show spectroscopic signatures of agn activity in their optical or near - ir spectra , @xmath110 @xcite , though strictly speaking the @xcite sample and our sample are not directly comparable as their selections are different .",
    "interestingly , we see no convincing trend in the detection of [ nev]@xmath714.32 as a function of ir luminosity . from table [ linefluxa ] the ulirgs with a [ nev]@xmath714.32 detection are fairly evenly spread between ir luminosities of @xmath111l@xmath27 and @xmath112l@xmath27 ; 10/22 ulirgs with a [ nev]@xmath714.32 detection have l@xmath113l@xmath27 , while 20/53 of the whole sample have l@xmath113l@xmath27 .",
    "this contrasts with optical / near - ir spectroscopic surveys , which report a rising fraction of ulirgs with agn signatures , reaching @xmath114 at @xmath115l@xmath27 @xcite.l@xmath27 , however this is for @xmath116 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 and @xmath117 a plausible reason for this discrepancy is high levels of extinction toward the nuclei of ulirgs . from ",
    "[ neosfr ] , the increase in extinction toward the nuclei of ulirgs compared to lower luminosity systems is of the order @xmath118 , making it harder to see agn signatures in the optical or near - ir .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy on the other hand appears to be a sensitive probe of the presence or otherwise of agn in ir - luminous systems .",
    "we detect [ oiv]@xmath725.89 in 21/22 objects that show [ nev]@xmath714.32 , and detect [ oiv]@xmath725.89 in only two objects that do not show [ nev]@xmath714.32 , suggesting that [ oiv]@xmath725.89 is a good , but not perfect proxy for [ nev]@xmath714.32 .",
    "we next consider diagnostics based on fine - structure line ratios . in figures",
    "[ hiresdiaga ] and [ hiresdiagb ] we plot [ nev]/[neii ] and [ oiv]/[neii ] against ir luminosity , together with the predicted agn contribution to the total ir luminosity based on these line ratios @xcite .",
    "both diagrams predict a broad spread in power source , ranging from 100% starburst to 100% agn . in both diagrams",
    "however only 10 - 12 ulirgs are above the 40% agn line , and more than half the sample lie below the 20% lines .",
    "this is consistent with star formation being the dominant contributor to the ir emission in most ulirgs , with only 20% of ulirgs hosting an agn with a comparable or greater ir luminosity than the starburst , in agreement with studies at other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "there are however many caveats in using such simple diagnostics @xcite , and figures [ hiresdiaga ] and [ hiresdiagb ] should not be considered reliable diagnostics of the power source in individual ulirgs , but rather as crude indicators of trends .",
    "it is however notable that we seem to have results consistent with other diagnostics for ( some ) individual objects .",
    "for example , both diagrams predict a small contribution from an agn in arp 220 , consistent with results from the x - ray @xcite and from iso @xcite , and 3c 273 , mrk 1014 , mrk 463e and iras 05189 - 2524 are all predicted to contain a luminous agn , in line with previous work @xcite .",
    "given the likely origin of the [ nev]@xmath714.32 line in agn , we can use the [ nev]/[neii ] ratio to test other mid - ir agn diagnostics .",
    "one such diagnostic is the iras 25@xmath1m/60@xmath1 m flux density ratio ; it has been suggested that ` warm ' objects ( those with @xmath119 ) are more likely to contain an agn than ` cool ' ( @xmath120 ) objects @xcite . in figure [ nevcfwarm ]",
    "we plot [ nev]/[neii ] against @xmath121 . just over half of the ` warm ' objects",
    "have [ nev]@xmath714.32 detections , compared to about one third of the ` cool ' objects .",
    "furthermore , for those objects with [ nev]@xmath714.32 detections , the ` warm ' objects have systematically higher [ nev]/[neii ] ratios than the cool objects . while our small sample sizes ( particularly for the warm objects ) render any conclusions tentative , we infer from this that the iras 25@xmath1m/60@xmath1 m flux density ratio is a reasonably good , though not perfect diagnostic for the presence of an ir - luminous agn in a ulirg .",
    "we move on to consider diagrams with a diagnostic of the starburst and agn luminosities on both the @xmath122 and @xmath123 axes .",
    "a natural diagnostic to combine with a fine - structure line ratio is a measure of the strength of the pah features .",
    "to measure pah strength we use the equivalent width ( ew ) of the 6.2@xmath1 m pah feature , taken from @xcite , as this feature is strong , and lies in a relatively uncluttered part of the mid - ir spectra of ulirgs , though its use does depend on an accurate correction for water ice and/or aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption . a mid - ir fine - structure line ratio @xmath124 pah ew diagnostic diagram has been used by several authors for many classes of ir - luminous galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in figures",
    "[ hipahdiaga ] and [ hipahdiagb ] we plot [ nev]/[neii ] and [ oiv]/[neii ] against the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath1 m pah feature , together with the linear mixing ratios from @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we again see a broad spread in fractional agn and starburst luminosities , from ` pure ' agn to ` pure ' starbursts .",
    "those sources classified by figures [ hipahdiaga ] and [ hipahdiagb ] as agn dominated tend to have pah@xmath125 , [ nev]/[neii]@xmath126 and [ oiv]/[neii]@xmath127 , whereas the ` pure ' starbursts tend to have pah@xmath128 , [ nev]/[neii]@xmath129 and [ oiv]/[neii]@xmath130 . the ir emission from the majority of the sample",
    "are still predicted to be powered mainly by star formation , though this trend is not so clear as from figure [ hiresdiaga ] .",
    "we see broad ( to within a factor of three ) agreement between the two axes , and also that no object lies in the ` forbidden ' top right hand corner of either diagram . in both diagrams ,",
    "the six objects which show a detection of the [ clii]@xmath714.37 line ( @xmath131[rarelines ] ) are mostly located toward the right hand side , consistent with the postulated origin of this line in star forming regions .",
    "it is however notable that several sources lie in a ` forbidden ' region in each diagram , where the pah equivalent widths suggest a low starburst contribution , but the fine - structure line ratios suggest a low agn contribution .",
    "there are , broadly , four possible reasons for this discrepancy , and would therefore give an unusually low [ nev]/[neii ] ratio , for example .",
    "we do not however have the data to address this possibility ] ; ( 1 ) underestimated 6.2@xmath1 m pah ews due to nearby water ice and/or aliphatic hydrocarbon absorption , ( 2 ) destruction of pahs in _ luminous _ starburst environments @xcite , ( 3 ) suppression of pah ews in _ compact _ starburst environments , and ( 4 ) increased general obscuration levels .",
    "we do not consider the first two possibilities likely though .",
    "we have in all cases used ice absorption - corrected values for the 6.2@xmath1 m pah ews ( the correction is of order @xmath132 for the 6.2@xmath1 m feature and less than @xmath133 for the 11.2@xmath1 m feature , @xcite ) and it is unlikely that any residual ice absorption could shift sources by such a significant distance on this plot . if the pahs were being destroyed in extremely luminous starbursts then we would expect the objects in the ` forbidden ' region to all have high ir luminosities , but the objects in this region ( e.g. iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 00397 - 1312 , iras 15462 - 0450 ) span a wide range in ir luminosity . a combination of increased overall obscuration and increased starburst compactness",
    "therefore seem the most likely culprits .",
    "the mixing ratios in both diagrams are based on starbursts and agn with ir luminosities of @xmath134l@xmath27 .",
    "their use therefore assumes a linear scaling between starburst and agn luminosity , and overall obscuration and starburst geometry , to give rise to comparable observed [ nev]/[neii ] and [ oiv]/[neii ] ratios and pah 6.2@xmath1 m ews .",
    "these assumptions are unlikely to be valid . for example , previous authors have noted @xmath135 s of ten or more , even in the mid - ir @xcite , and we derived @xmath118 over and above lower luminosity stabursts in  [ neosfr ] . increased overall obscuration will lead to greater suppression of the [ nev ] and [ oiv ] lines compared to the [ neii ] line , as these regions must lie closer to the starburst and/or agn .",
    "this increased obscuration will also arise in lower than expected pah luminosities , but is unlikely to affect their ews .",
    "however , we expect more compact starbursts to have a stronger mid - ir continuum , which will lead to suppression of pah ews . overall therefore , increased overall obscuration combined with more spatially compact starbursts in ulirgs compared to lower luminosity systems can plausibly explain the outliers in figures [ hipahdiaga ] and [ hipahdiagb ] .",
    "an important caveat however is that diagrams like figures [ hipahdiaga ] and [ hipahdiagb ] are not suited to studying the physics of individual objects , and can often get the answers wrong .",
    "for example , if the power source is so obscured that it does not emit significantly at wavelengths shortward of @xmath136 m , then mid - ir fine structure line ratio @xmath124 pah ew diagnostic plots can give misleading results @xcite .",
    "some ` outliers ' are therefore understandable .",
    "one example is iras 15206 + 3342 ( # 28 ) .",
    "this object lies squarely in the ` starburst ' part of both plots , and from this one might conclude that it does not contain an energetically significant agn .",
    "its uv spectrum @xcite however shows clear evidence for a broad absorption line qso .",
    "a second example is ngc 6240 , which also lies in the ` starburst ' part of both plots , despite the extensive evidence for an ir - luminous agn in this source @xcite .",
    "the key point is that diagnostics such as those in figures [ hipahdiaga ] and [ hipahdiagb ] probe the physics of specific environments within ulirgs . to obtain a complete picture of an individual object",
    "therefore requires multiple diagnostics to probe multiple environments .",
    "we explore the issue of mid - ir obscuration in ulirgs further by combining the diagnostics discussed previously with a measure of the strength of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption feature , @xmath5 :    @xmath137    where @xmath138 is the observed flux at rest - frame 9.7@xmath1 m , and @xmath139 is the underlying continuum flux at rest - frame 9.7@xmath1 m deduced from a spline fit to the continuum flux at rest frame 5.0 - 7.0 , 14.0 - 14.5 , and 25.0 - 40.0@xmath1 m",
    ". a complete description of the method used to measure @xmath5 can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the silicate strengths for our sample are measured from the low resolution spectra , and are presented in @xcite .",
    "in figure [ oivsi ] we plot @xmath5 against the [ oiv]/[neii ] line ratio , along with the ` reference ' starbursts and agn @xcite .",
    "the reference starbursts and agn separate well on the @xmath123 axis , with most of the agn above [ oiv]/[neii]=0.2 and most of the starbursts below . nearly all the starbursts and agn",
    "are confined to @xmath140 .",
    "the ulirgs are found over the whole range of [ oiv]/[neii ] ratios where the reference samples are seen , but are offset on the @xmath122 axis , with greater silicate strengths for a given [ oiv]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this is that the starbursts in ulirgs are similar in nature to those in lower luminosity systems , but with significantly greater ( @xmath42 s of a few tens ) total obscuration , consistent with the conclusion in  [ neosfr ] .",
    "it would be natural , from this , to postulate that silicate strength is a measure of the total obscuration of the starburst .",
    "if so , then we might expect a correlation between star formation rate and silicate strength ; the reasoning being that a more luminous starburst will have a deeper 9.7@xmath1 m absorption feature as the starburst has an increased total dust column .",
    "it is straightforward to test this hypothesis ; in figure [ sidepthcode ] we duplicate figure [ hoketoalt ] , but this time color - coded each object according to its silicate strength . clearly , there is no correlation .",
    "objects with the strongest silicate absorption seem to be confined to the lower left of the plot , though with only three objects it is impossible to draw firm conclusions .",
    "the other objects seem to be scattered randomly ; strongly absorbed and weakly absorbed sources are found from the top right to the bottom left .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath5 was simply a measure of the obscuration of the starburst , then we would expect the sources with the greatest negative offset from the ho & keto line in figure [ hoketoalt ] to have the largest values of @xmath5 , but this is not the case .",
    "for example , three of the sources with the greatest negative offset in figure [ hoketoalt ] , iras 06035 - 7102 , iras 20551 - 4250 , and 3c 273 , range from having a deep silicate absorption feature to a silicate emission feature .",
    "we infer from this that silicate strength is not simply a measure of the total obscuration of the starbursts in ulirgs .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite , based on the molecular hydrogen line strengths .",
    "we move on to consider a different scenario , in which the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption in ulirgs is affected by the agn as well as , or instead of , the starburst . to examine this possibility",
    "we duplicate the plot in figure [ hipahdiagb ] in figure [ sidepthcodeb ] , again color - coding each point by its silicate strength . from this",
    "we see that both strongly and weakly absorbed sources are found across the span of the plot , and there is no appreciable trend in _ average _ silicate strength in any direction .",
    "there is however one interesting trend .",
    "those sources towards the left side of the diagram tend to have either very deep absorption , or very shallow to no absorption , whereas those objects on the right hand side of the plot seem to be almost universally ` averagely ' absorbed .",
    "of the 13 objects on the right hand side , all but two ( iras 15206 + 3342 & iras 23128 - 5919 ) have @xmath141 .",
    "of the 13 objects on the left hand side , only one ( iras 12514 + 1027 ) does not satisfy @xmath142 or @xmath143 .",
    "overall , there is a clear shift in the distribution of values of @xmath5 as we move from the left hand side to the right hand side of the plot , from a single , broad peak centered at around @xmath144 to two narrower peaks , one at @xmath145 and one at @xmath146 .",
    "this shift is conceptually similar to the ` fork ' diagram in @xcite .",
    "these distributions in silicate strength can be interpreted in one of two ways .",
    "the first is that very strong or very weak silicate absorption indicates the presence of an agn , with moderate silicate absorption indicating the presence of a starburst . for an agn",
    "we expect a strong dependence of observed properties on viewing angle , as nearly all lines of evidence suggest that the dust in agn is arranged in a planar structure , whether that structure is a torus @xcite , a flared disk @xcite , or discrete clouds @xcite . for a starburst",
    "however we expect a weaker ( though still possibly significant ) dependence on viewing angle ; millimeter interferometry has shown that the starburst regions in ulirgs are dense and compact @xcite , while recent theoretical ( e.g. @xcite ) and indirect observational evidence suggests that starbursts in ulirgs are unlikely to have a disklike structure @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the distribution of values of @xmath5 in obscured agn will be bimodal , with a high apparent obscuration when the agn is viewed edge on , but low obscuration when the agn is viewed face on , but that the dependence of @xmath5 on the viewing angle of the starburst will be weaker .",
    "this is supported by the fact that optical qsos usually show silicates in emission @xcite , and that one of the two objects on the right hand side of the lower panel of figure [ sidepthcode ] is iras 15206 + 3342 which , as previously mentioned , contains a bal qso .",
    "the second way is that the sources with @xmath147 instead contain an extremely obscured starburst , and that only those sources with either a [ nev ] detection or a silicate feature in emission contain an ir - luminous agn .",
    "this scenario is plausible as a very compact , highly obscured starburst could also result in suppression of pah features , and would also explain the absence of [ nev ] detections ( if the starburst surrounds the agn ) in the few objects on the left hand side of figure [ sidepthcodeb ] with @xmath147 . with the data available to us it is difficult to choose between these two possibilities .",
    "both scenarios are consistent with the ` fork ' diagram in @xcite for example . with some reserve therefore , we propose that the first scenario is more likely , and that moderate silicate absorption signifies the presence of a dominant starburst , but that very deep or very shallow silicate absorption in ulirgs likely signifies the presence of a bolometrically significant agn .",
    "we have presented an atlas of fine structure lines and other emission features measured from high resolution mid - infrared spectra of 53 ulirgs at 0.018@xmath1480.319 , taken using the infrared spectrograph onboard the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we have employed a variety of diagnostics using these emission lines as well as those based on pah features and the strength of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption feature to investigate the power source behind the infrared emission .",
    "our conclusions are :    \\1 ) all of the spectra show various of fine structure emission lines of neon , oxygen , and sulfur , as well as one or more molecular hydrogen lines . we see the [ neii]@xmath712.81 , [ neiii]@xmath715.56 and [ siii]@xmath718.71 in most of the sample , and [ siv]@xmath710.51 in just under half the sample . the higher ionization lines [ nev]@xmath714.32 and [ oiv]@xmath725.89 are detected in just under half the sample , while [ nev]@xmath724.32 is detected in about one third of the sample .",
    "rarer lines include [ clii]@xmath714.37 ( six objects ) , hi 7 - 6@xmath712.37 ( four objects ) , [ piii]@xmath717.89 ( two objects ) , and [ arv]@xmath713.10 ( two objects ) .",
    "some objects also show low - ionization iron lines , including [ feii]@xmath5617.94,24.52,25.99 and [ feiii]@xmath722.93 .",
    "the detection of three further lines is dependent on redshift , but we see [ siii]@xmath733.48 in @xmath680% of the objects where this line lies within the bandpass , [ arii]@xmath78.99 in just over @xmath149 , and [ siii]@xmath734.82 in just over @xmath149 .",
    "\\2 ) the presence of the [ nev]@xmath714.32@xmath1 m line in 22/53 objects is direct spectroscopic evidence for the presence of an agn that provides a significant , though not necessarily dominant fraction of the mid - ir flux in @xmath8 of ulirgs .",
    "based on this , we find that the iras 25@xmath1m/60@xmath1 m flux density ratio is a reasonable , though not perfect , diagnostic for the presence of an ir - luminous agn in ulirgs . in most , but not all objects where we see",
    "[ nev]@xmath714.32@xmath1 m we also see [ oiv]@xmath725.89 , suggesting that [ oiv]@xmath725.89 is a good proxy for the [ nev]@xmath714.32@xmath1 m .",
    "in contrast , we see [ siv]@xmath710.51 in a surprisingly low fraction of the sample , given that its ionization energy is comparable to that of [ neiii]@xmath715.56 , and that the h@xmath3,s(3)@xmath79.66 line is seen in most of our sample .",
    "the most likely reason for this is that the the neon and sulfur emitting zones in our samples lie within regions that are more strongly extincted by silicate dust than the h@xmath3 emitting regions ; the increased extinction due to the nearby 9.7@xmath1 m absorption feature would then weaken the apparent flux of [ siv]@xmath710.51 relative to [ neiii]@xmath715.56 .",
    "\\3 ) we use the [ neiii]/[neii ] vs [ siv]/[siii ] plane to show that the excitation levels in the mid - ir emitting regions span more than two orders of magnitude in both the neon and sulfur line ratios .",
    "the range in both line ratios is comparable to that seen in starbursts and agn with ir luminosities in the range @xmath9l@xmath10(l@xmath11 , but we see a systematically lower [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio for a given [ siv]/[siii ] in our sample compared to systems with ir luminosities of @xmath150l@xmath27 , possibly due to the increased density of gas in the nlr of ulirgs .",
    "we use the [ nev]14.32@xmath1m/[nev]24.32@xmath1 m and the [ siii]18.71@xmath1m/[siii]33.48@xmath1 m line ratios to show that the electron densities in the mid - ir emitting regions of ulirgs are @xmath63 @xmath64 in all cases , well below the critical densities .",
    "\\4 ) we show that the combined luminosity of the [ neiii]@xmath715.56 and [ neii]@xmath712.81 lines correlates with both total ir luminosity ( figure [ hoketo ] ) , and the combined luminosity of the pah 6.2@xmath1 m and 11.2@xmath1 m features ( figure [ hoketoalt ] ) . combining this result with previous work @xcite",
    ", we derive a calibration between star formation rate and pah 6.2@xmath1 m + 11.2@xmath1 m luminosity for ulirgs :        \\5 ) we employ a variety of spectral diagnostics to show that , despite the presence of a luminous agn in @xmath642% of ulirgs , the most likely dominant contributor to the total ir emission in most ulirgs is star formation , with an agn providing a higher contribution than a starburst in only @xmath152 of ulirgs .",
    "the fine structure line ratios , luminosities and pah ews of our sample are consistent with the starbursts and agn in ulirgs being more extincted ( @xmath118 ) , and for the starbursts more compact , versions of those in lower luminosity systems .",
    "\\6 ) we show that the strength of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate feature is unlikely to be a simple indicator of the total obscuration of the starburst .",
    "we combine measurements of pah equivalent widths , 9.7@xmath1 m silicate feature strengths , and fine structure line ratios to show that ulirgs with silicate strengths of @xmath143 likely contain an energetically significant agn , whereas the ir emission from ulirgs with @xmath141 is likely dominated by star formation .",
    "we postulate that ulirgs with @xmath142 contain an deeply buried agn , though a comparably obscured starburst is also possible .",

    "<S> we employ diagnostics based on the fine - structure emission lines , as well as the equivalent widths and luminosities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features and the strength of the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate absorption feature ( @xmath5 ) , to explore the power source behind the infrared emission in ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the infrared emission from the majority of ulirgs is powered mostly by star formation , with only @xmath620% of ulirgs hosting an agn with a comparable or greater ir luminosity than the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of the [ nev]@xmath714.32 line in just under half the sample however implies that an agn makes a significant contribution to the mid - ir flux in @xmath8 of ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> the fine structure line ratios , luminosities and pah ews of our sample are consistent with the starbursts and agn in ulirgs being more extincted , and for the starbursts more compact , versions of those in lower luminosity systems . </S>",
    "<S> the excitations and electron densities in the narrow - line regions of ulirgs appear comparable to those of lower luminosity ( @xmath9l@xmath10(l@xmath11 ) starbursts , though there is evidence that the nlr gas in ulirgs is more dense . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the combined luminosity of the [ neii]@xmath712.81 and [ neiii]@xmath715.56 lines correlates with with both infrared luminosity and luminosity of the 6.2@xmath1 m and 11.2@xmath1 m pah features in ulirgs , and use this to derive a calibration between pah luminosity and star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that those ulirgs with @xmath12 are likely to be powered mainly by star formation , but that those with @xmath13 , and possibly those with @xmath14 , contain an ir - luminous agn . </S>"
