    "the past decades have seen an accelerating miniaturization of both mechanical and electrical devices , so that a better understanding of properties of ultrasmall systems is required in increasing detail .",
    "the first measurements of conductance quantization in the late 1980s @xcite in constrictions of two - dimensional electron gases formed by means of gates , have demonstrated the importance of quantum confinement effects in these systems and opened a wide field of research .",
    "a major step has been the discovery of conductance quantization in metallic nanocontacts @xcite : the conductance measured during the elongation of a metal nanowire is a steplike function where the typical step height is frequently near a multiple of the conductance quantum @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron charge and @xmath2 planck s constant .",
    "surprisingly , this was initially not interpreted as a quantum effect but rather as a consequence of abrupt atomic rearrangements and elastic deformation stages .",
    "this interpretation , supported by a series of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , was claimed to be confirmed by another pioneering experiment @xcite measuring simultaneously the conductance and the cohesive force of gold nanowires with diameters ranging from several ngstroms to several nanometers .",
    "as the contact was pulled apart , oscillations in the force of order 1nn were observed in perfect correlation with the conductance steps .",
    "it came as a surprise when stafford _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) introduced the free - electron model of a nanocontact  referred to as the _ nanoscale free - electron model _ ( nfem ) henceforth  and showed that this comparatively simple model , which emphasizes the quantum confinement effects of the metallic electrons , is able to reproduce quantitatively the main features of the experimental observations . in this approach",
    ", the nanowire is understood to act as a quantum waveguide for the conduction electrons ( which are responsible for both conduction and cohesion in simple metals ) : each quantized mode transmitted through the contact contributes @xmath3 to the conductance and a force of order @xmath4 to the cohesion , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the fermi energy and wavelength , respectively .",
    "conductance channels act as delocalized bonds whose stretching and breaking is responsible for the observed force oscillations , thus explaining straightforwardly their correlations with the conductance steps .    since then , free - standing metal nanowires , suspended from electrical contacts at their ends , have been fabricated by a number of different techniques .",
    "metal wires down to a single atom thick were extruded using a scanning - tunneling microscope tip @xcite .",
    "metal nanobridges were shown to `` self - assemble '' under electron - beam irradiation of thin metal films ( kondo _ et al . _",
    "1997 , 2000 , rodrigues _",
    "et al . _  2000",
    ") , leading to nearly perfect cylinders down to four atoms in diameter , with lengths up to fifteen nanometers .",
    "in particular , the mechanically - controllable break junction technique , introduced by moreland and ekin ( 1985 ) and refined by ruitenbeek and coworkers @xcite , has allowed for systematic studies of nanowire properties for a variety of materials . for a survey see the review by agrat _",
    "et al . _  ( 2003 ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of metal nanowires is that they are stable at all .",
    "most atoms in such a thin wire are at the surface , with small coordination numbers , so that _ surface effects _ play a key role in their energetics .",
    "indeed , macroscopic arguments comparing the surface - induced stress to the yield strength indicate a minimum radius for solidity of order ten nanometers @xcite . below this critical radius and absent some other stabilizing mechanism , plastic flow would lead to a rayleigh instability @xcite breaking the wire apart into clusters . already in the 19th century plateau ( 1873 )",
    "realized that this surface - tension - driven instability is unavoidable if cohesion is due solely to classical pairwise interactions between atoms .",
    "the experimental evidence accumulated over the past decade on the remarkable stability of nanowires considerably thinner than the above estimate clearly shows that electronic effects emphasized by the nfem dominate over atomistic effects for sufficiently small radii .    a series of experiments on alkali metal nanocontacts ( yanson _ et al . _  1999 , 2001 ) identified _ electron - shell effects _ , which represent the semiclassical limit of the quantum - size effects discussed above , as a key mechanism influencing nanowire stability .",
    "energetically - favorable structures were revealed as peaks in conductance histograms , periodic in the nanowire radius , analogous to the electron - shell structure previously observed in metal clusters @xcite .",
    "a supershell structure was also observed @xcite , in the form of a periodic modulation of the peak heights .",
    "more recently , such electron - shell effects have also been observed , even at room temperature , for the noble metals gold , copper , and silver ( diaz _ et al .",
    "_  2003 , mares _",
    "et al . _",
    "2004 , 2005 ) as well as for aluminum @xcite .",
    "soon after the first experimental evidence for electron shell effects in metal nanowires , a theoretical analysis using the nfem found that nanowire stability can be explained by a competition of the two key factors , surface tension and electron - shell effects @xcite .",
    "both linear @xcite and nonlinear ( brki _ et al . _",
    "2003 , 2005a ) stability analyses of axially symmetric nanowires found that the surface - tension driven instability can be completely suppressed in the vicinity of certain `` magic radii . ''",
    "however , the restriction to axial symmetry implies characteristic gaps in the sequence of stable nanowires , which is not fully consistent with the experimentally observed nearly perfect periodicity of the conductance peak positions . a jahn - teller deformation breaking the symmetry can lead to more stable deformed configurations .",
    "recently , the linear stability analysis was extended to wires with arbitrary cross - section ( urban _ et al . _  2004a , 2006 ) .",
    "this general analysis confirms the existence of a sequence of magic cylindrical wires of exceptional stability which represent roughly 75% of the main structures observed in conductance histograms .",
    "the remaining 25% are deformed and predominantly of elliptical or quadrupolar shapes .",
    "this result allows for a consistent interpretation of experimental conductance histograms for alkali and noble metals , including both the electronic shell and supershell structures @xcite .",
    "this chapter is intended to give an introduction to the nfem .",
    "section [ sec : model ] summarizes the assumptions and features of the model while the general formalism is described in sec.[sec : formalism ] . in the following sections ,",
    "two applications of the nfem will be discussed : first , we give a unified explanation of electrical transport and cohesion in metal nanocontacts ( sec .  [",
    "sec : forcecond ] ) and second , the linear stability analysis for straight metal nanowires will be presented ( sec .",
    "[ sec : stabana ] ) .",
    "the latter will include cylindrical wires as well as wires with broken axial symmetry , thereby discussing the jahn - teller - effect .",
    "guided by the importance of conduction electrons in the cohesion of metals , and by the success of the jellium model in describing metal clusters @xcite , the nfem replaces the metal ions by a uniform , positively charged background that provides a confining potential for the electrons .",
    "the electron motion is free along the wire , and confined in the transverse directions .",
    "usually an infinite confinement potential ( hard - wall boundary conditions ) for the electrons is chosen .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the effective potential confining the electrons to the wire will be short ranged due to the strong screening in good metals .    in a first approximation",
    "electron - electron interactions are neglected , which is reasonable due to the excellent screening @xcite in metal wires with @xmath7 .",
    "it is known from cluster physics that a free electron model gives qualitative agreement and certainly describes the essential physics involved .",
    "interaction , exchange and correlation effects as well as a realistic confinement potential have to be taken into account , however , for quantitative agreement . from this",
    "we infer that the same is true for metal nanowires , where similar confinement effects are important .",
    "remarkably , the electron - shell effects crucial to the stabilization of long wires are described with quantitative accuracy by the simple free - electron model , as discussed below .",
    "in addition , the nfem assumes that the positive background behaves like an incompressible fluid when deforming the nanowire .",
    "this takes into account , to lowest order , the hard - core repulsion of core electrons as well as the exchange energy of conduction electrons .",
    "when using a hard - wall confinement , the fermi energy @xmath5 ( or equivalently the fermi wavelength @xmath6 ) is the only parameter entering the nfem .",
    "as @xmath5 is material dependent and experimentally accessible , there is no adjustable parameter .",
    "this pleasant feature needs to be abandoned in order to model different materials more realistically .",
    "different kinds of appropriate surface boundary conditions are imaginable in order to model the behaviour of an incompressible fluid and to fit the surface properties of various metals .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalconstraint ] .    a more refined model of a nanocontact would consider effects of scattering from disorder ( brki _ et al . _  1999a ,",
    "b ) and electron - electron interaction via a hartree approximation @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of disorder in particular leads to a better quantitative agreement with transport measurements , but does not change the cohesive properties qualitatively in any significant way , while electron - electron interactions are found to be a small correction in most cases . as a result ,",
    "efforts to make the nfem more realistic do not improve it significantly , while removing one of its main strengths , the absence of any adjustable parameters .",
    "the major shortcoming of the nfem is that its applicability is limited to good metals having a nearly spherical fermi surface .",
    "it is best suited for the ( highly reactive ) s - orbital alkali metals , providing a theoretical understanding of the important physics in nanowires .",
    "the nfem has also been proven to qualitatively ( and often semi - quantitatively ) describe noble metal nanowires , and in particular , gold .",
    "lately , it has been shown that the nfem can even be applied ( within a certain parameter range ) to describe the multivalent metal aluminum , since al shows an almost spherical fermi surface in the extended - zone scheme .",
    "the nfem is especially suitable to describe shell effects due to the conduction - band s - electrons , and the experimental observation of a crossover from atomic - shell to electron - shell effects with decreasing radius in both metal clusters @xcite and nanowires @xcite justifies _ a posteriori _ the use of the nfem in the later regime .",
    "naturally , the nfem does not capture effects originating from the directionality of bonding , such as the effect of surface reconstruction observed for au .",
    "for this reason it can not be used to model atomic chains of au atoms , which are currently extensively studied experimentally . keeping these limitations in mind ,",
    "the nfem is applicable within a certain range of radius , capturing nanowires with only very few atoms in cross - section up to wires of several nanometers in thickness , depending on the material under consideration .",
    "a metal nanowire represents an open system connected to metallic electrodes at each end .",
    "these macroscopic electrodes act as ideal electron reservoirs in thermal equilibrium with a well - defined temperature and chemical potential . when treating an open system , the schrdinger equation is most naturally formulated as a scattering problem .",
    "the basic idea of the scattering approach is to relate physical properties of the wire with transmission and reflection amplitudes for electrons being injected from the leads .",
    "the fundamental quantity describing the properties of the system is the energy - dependent unitary scattering matrix @xmath8 connecting incoming and outgoing asymptotic states of conduction electrons in the electrodes . for a quantum wire , @xmath8",

    "the eigenmodes of the leads are also referred to as scattering channels .",

    "the maximum temperature up to which the wires remain stable , given in the last column of tab.[tab : deformedwires ] , is expressed in units of @xmath98 .",
    "the use of this characteristic temperature reflects the temperature dependence of the shell correction to the wire energy @xcite .",

    "fortunately , the stability matrix @xmath101 for cylinders is found to be diagonal , and therefore the different fourier contributions of the deformation decouple .",

    "the heights of the dominant stability peaks in fig.[fig : stabcylinders ] exhibit a periodic modulation , with minima occurring near @xmath105 9 , 29 , 59 , 117 , ... the positions of these minima are in perfect agreement with the observed supershell structure in conductance histograms of alkali metal nanowires @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the nodes of the supershell structure , where the shell effect for a cylinder is suppressed , are precisely where the most stable deformed nanowires are predicted to occur ( see discussion above ) .",
    "thus symmetry breaking distortions and the supershell effect are inextricably linked .",
    "linear stability is a necessary  but not a sufficient  condition for a nanostructure to be observed experimentally .",
    "the linearly stable nanocylinders revealed in the above analysis are in fact _",
    "metastable _ structures , and an analysis of their lifetime has been carried out within an axisymmetric stochastic field theory by brki _",
    "et al . _  ( 2005a ) .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the height of the stable fingers in the linear stability analysis and the size of the activation barriers @xmath106 , which determines the nanowire lifetime @xmath107 through the kramers formula @xmath108 .",
    "this suggests that the linear stability analysis , with temperature expressed in units of @xmath109 , provides a good measure of the total stability of metal nanowires . in particular , the `` universal '' stability of the most stable cylinders",
    "is reproduced , wherein the absolute stability of the magic cylinders is essentially independent of radius ( aside from the small supershell oscillations ) .",
    "a detailed comparison between the theoretically most stable structures and experimental data for sodium is provided in fig.[fig : compare ] . for each stable finger in the linear stability analysis its mean conductance is extracted and plotted as a function of its index number , together with experimental data by yanson _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "this comparison shows that there is a one - to - one relation between observed conductance peaks and theoretically stable geometries which in particular allows for a prediction of the cross - sectional shape of the wires .",
    "this striking fit is only possible when including non - axisymmetric wires , which represent roughly 25% of the most stable structures and which are labeled by the corresponding aspect ratios @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "the remaining @xmath111 of the principal structures correspond to the magic cylinders .",
    "the role of symmetry in the stability of metal nanowires is thus fundamentally different from the case of atomic nuclei or metal clusters , where the vast majority of stable structures have broken symmetry .",
    "the crucial difference between the stability of metal nanowires and metal clusters is not the shell effect , which is similar in both cases , but rather the surface energy , which favors the sphere , but abhors the cylinder .",
    "besides the geometries entering the comparison above , the stability analysis also reveals two highly deformed quadrupolar nanowires with conductance values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , cf.tab .",
    "[ tab : deformedwires ] .",
    "they are expected to appear more rarely due to their reduced stability relative to the neighboring peaks , and their large aspect ratio @xmath110 that renders them rather isolated in configuration space .",
    "nevertheless they can be identified by a detailed analysis of conductance histograms of the alkali metals @xcite .",
    "results for different metals are similar in respect to the number of stable configurations and the conductance of the wires . on the other hand , the deviations from axial symmetry and the relative stability of jahn - teller deformed wires is sensitive to the material - specific surface tension and fermi temperature .",
    "the relative stability of the highly deformed wires decreases with increasing surface tension @xmath114 , measured in intrinsic units , and this decrease becomes stronger with increasing order @xmath99 of the deformation .",
    "therefore , for the simple s - orbital metals under consideration ( tab.[tab : sigma.gamma ] ) , deformed li wires have the highest , and au wires have the lowest relative stability compared to cylinders of `` magic radii . ''",
    "notable in this respect is aluminum with @xmath115 , some five times smaller than the value for au .",
    "aluminum is a trivalent metal , but the fermi surface of bulk al resembles a free - electron fermi sphere in the extended - zone scheme .",
    "this suggests the applicability of the nfem to al nanowires , although the continuum approximation is more severe than for monovalent metals .    .",
    "thick lines mark stable wires in the configuration space of rms radius @xmath116 and deformation parameter @xmath96 .",
    "the dashed box emphasizes a series of very stable superdeformed wires , whose peanut - shaped cross section is shown as an inset .",
    "this sequence was recently identified experimentally @xcite .",
    "[ fig : alstabdia],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    recent experiments @xcite have found evidence for the fact that the stability of aluminum nanowires also is governed by shell filling effects .",
    "two magic series of stable structures have been observed with a crossover at @xmath117 and the exceptionally    stable structures have been related to electronic and atomic shell effects , respectively . concerning the former",
    ", the nfem can quantitatively explain the conductance and geometry of the stable structures for wires with @xmath118 and there is a perfect one - to - one correspondence of the predicted stable al nanowires and the experimental electron - shell structure .",
    "moreover , an experimentally observed third sequence of stable structures with conductance @xmath119 provides intriguing evidence for the existence of `` superdeformed '' nanowires whose cross sections have an aspect ratio near 2:1 .",
    "theoretically , these wires are quite stable compared to other highly deformed structures and , more importantly , are very isolated in configuration space , as illustrated in the stability diagram shown in fig.[fig : alstabdia ] .",
    "this favors their experimental detection if the initial structure of the nanocontact formed in the break junction is rather planar with a large aspect ratio since then it is likely that the aspect ratio is maintained as the wire necks down elastically .",
    "aluminum is unique in this respect and evidence of superdeformation has not been reported in any of the previous experiments on alkali and noble metals , presumably because highly - deformed structures are intrinsically less stable than nearly axisymmetric structures , due to their larger surface energy .",
    "in this chapter we have given an overview on the nanoscale free - electron model , treating a metal nanowire as a non - interacting electron gas confined to a given geometry by hard - wall boundary conditions . at first sight",
    ", the nfem seems to be an overly simple model , but closer study reveals that it contains very rich and complex features . since its first introduction in 1997 , it has repeatedly shown that it captures the important physics and is able to explain qualitatively , when not quantitatively , many of the experimentally observed properties of alkali and noble metal nanowires .",
    "its strengths compared to other approaches are , in particular , the absence of any free parameters and the treatment of electrical and mechanical properties on an equal footing .",
    "moreover , the advantage of obtaining analytical results allows the possibility to gain some detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the stability and structural dynamics of metal nanowires .",
    "the nfem correctly describes electronic quantum size effects , which play an essential role in the stability of nanowires .",
    "a linear stability analysis shows that the classical rayleigh instability of a long wire under surface tension can be completely suppressed by electronic shell effects , leading to a sequence of certain stable `` magic '' wire geometries .",
    "the derived sequence of stable cylindrical and quadrupolar wires explains the experimentally observed shell and supershell structures for the alkali and noble metals as well as for aluminum .",
    "the most stable wires with broken axial symmetry are found at the nodes of the supershell structure , indicating that the jahn - teller distortions and the supershell effect are inextricably linked .",
    "in addition , a series of superdeformed aluminum nanowires with an aspect ratio near 2:1 is found which has lately been identified experimentally . a more elaborate fully quantum mechanical analysis within the nfem reveals an interplay between the rayleigh and a peierls - type instability .",
    "the latter is length - dependent and limits the maximal length of stable nanowires but other than that confirms the results obtained by the long wavelength expansion discussed above .",
    "remarkably , certain gold nanowires are predicted to remain stable even at room temperature up to a maximal length in the micrometer range , sufficient for future nanotechnological applications .",
    "the nfem can be expanded by including the structural dynamics of the wire in terms of a continuum model of the surface diffusion of the ions .",
    "furthermore , defects and structural fluctuations may also be accounted for .",
    "these extensions improve the agreement with experiments but do not alter the main conclusions .",
    "however , the nfem does not address the discrete atomic structure of metal nanowires . with increasing thickness of the wire the effects of surface tension decrease and",
    "there is a crossover from plastic flow of ions to crystalline order , the latter implying atomic shell effects observed for thicker nanowires .",
    "therefore , the nfem applies to a window of conductance values between a few @xmath3 and about @xmath120 , depending on the material under consideration .",
    "promising extensions of the nfem in view of current research activities are directed , e.g. , towards the study of metal nanowires in nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) which couple nanoscale mechanical resonators to electronic devices of similar dimensions .",
    "the nfem is ideally suited for the investigation of such systems since it naturally comprises electrical as well as mechanical properties .",
    "it is hoped that the generic behaviour of metal nanostructures elucidated by the nfem can guide the exploration of more elaborate , material - specific models , in the same way that the free - electron model provides an important theoretical reference point from which to understand the complex properties of real bulk metals ."
