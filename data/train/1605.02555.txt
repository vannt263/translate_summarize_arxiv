    "this paper is devoted to the systematic studies of the asymptotic solutions of advection equation with time - oscillating velocity field .",
    "we employ the two - timing method in the form introduced by @xcite , which allows us to produce the classification of an infinite number of distinguished limits and solutions .",
    "we have obtained several new versions of averaged equations for a passive scalar and have presented several examples .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is the introduction of a new systematic and general viewpoint on the hierarchy of distinguished limits , drifts , and pseudo - diffusion .",
    "this viewpoint can help to organize and to unify a number of results , including that of @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the advection equation as the simplest interesting example , with the hope that similar studies can be performed for other interesting equations .",
    "the two - timing method has been used by many authors , see @xcite , however our analysis goes well beyond the usual calculations of the main approximations in various special cases .",
    "our analytic calculations are rigorous and straightforward by their nature , however they include a large number of integration by parts and algebraic transformations ; the performing of such calculations represents a ` champion - type ' result by itself .",
    "the details of calculations are fully presented in the appendix .",
    "the key point of asymptotic theory for odes or pdes ( with two or more small parameters ) is the choice of asymptotic path in the space of these parameters . in other words ,",
    "all available small parameters should be expressed through a single one ; it allows one to compare different terms in asymptotic series .",
    "the related literature is very diverse and short of exact mathematical formulations .",
    "usually , during the studies of a particular problem , some ` lucky ' asymptotic path is chosen on the basis that it gives the successful derivation of an averaged equation or successful calculation of the main term in asymptotic solution , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "such ` lucky ' asymptotic paths are called _ distinguished limits _ ( dl s ) , while related solutions are called _ distinguished limit solutions _ ( dls s ) .",
    "any studies of the multiplicity of distinguished paths ( as well as the multiplicity of averaged equations and related solutions ) and interrelations between them are always avoided .",
    "a different approach is given by @xcite , where the concept of ` strong ' , ` moderate ' , and ` weak ' oscillations is introduced .",
    "however , this approach overlooks some asymptotic solutions and could be seen as being ` too rigid ' ; therefore we propose its development in this paper .",
    "our asymptotic procedure is based on the simultaneous scaling ( with the use of strouhal number @xmath0 ) a slow time - scale and vibrational velocity amplitude .",
    "this procedure is flexible , self - consistent , covers broad classes of asymptotic solutions , and leads to a natural classification of solutions .",
    "the considered advection equation is a hyperbolic pde of the first order with time - oscillating coefficient , which represents the _ prescribed _ velocity field .",
    "we emphasize that the velocity field has no connection to any particular dynamics . indeed",
    ", the governing equations for a velocity can be chosen very differently : they could represent an inviscid or viscous fluid , a fluid with any rheology , liquid crystals , blood , elastic and plastic medium , _ etc .",
    "_ the advection equation can be also a part of the collisionless boltzmann equation or vlasov equation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of dimensional variables into the advection equation and the use of the two - timing assumption leads us to the problem with _ two independent small scaling parameters that represent the ratio of two time - scales and amplitude of oscillations_. the given set of parameters produces the _ strouhal number @xmath0 as a basic large dimensionless parameter _ ; the appearance of @xmath0 means that the scaling is not unique . in agrement with the general _ ansatz _ of asymptotic theory we can use @xmath0 to vary all the characteristic scales ; in our approach we use @xmath0 to introduce the appropriate scales of velocity and slow time .",
    "the obtained dimensionless equation has been used for the identifying of distinguished limits .",
    "we have found the infinite sequence of the distinguished limits , which are corresponding to the successive degeneration of a drift velocity .",
    "the _ order _ of this degeneration is chosen to enumerate the distinguished limits .",
    "the derivation of averaged equations produce the successive approximations for a drift velocity as well as a qualitatively new ` diffusion - like ' term , which we call _ pseudo - diffusion_. remarkably , all the coefficients in the obtained averaged equations are universal ; they are the same in dls s of different orders and only ` moving ' to lower approximations with the increasing of the order of dls . as the next important step we discover _ one - parametric _ families of solutions ( infinite number of solutions corresponding to each dls ) ,",
    "different parametric solutions contain different slow time - scales and different velocity amplitudes .",
    "our results are particularly striking for the case of purely periodic velocity oscillations . here",
    "we address an intriguing question : how to find the related slow time - scale while it does not appear in the coefficients of the equation ?",
    "our answer is : the slow time - scale is uniquely determined by the magnitude of a given velocity in terms of @xmath0 . for a given velocity",
    "we obtain the unique slow time - scale .",
    "we have established that the solutions corresponding to different orders of velocity are physically different even if they have the same functional form .",
    "the central notion which appears in this paper is a _",
    "drift velocity_. our study can be seen as a general view on the studies of drift velocities with the emphasis at their different appearances in averaged equations ; it is complemented by an unexpected but inevitable appearance of pseudo - diffusion .",
    "we put the studies of drifts into the general context of the asymptotic theory , that has never been done before .",
    "in addition , there is a difference between the _ classical drift _ and _ eulerian drift_. the classical ( or lagrangian ) drift appears as an averaged velocity for fixed lagrangian coordinates ; hence the classical drift represents an average velocity of material particles .",
    "the classical drift , in its main approximation , is a well - studied phenomenon , see @xcite . in our consideration ( as well as in @xcite )",
    "the average operation takes place for _ fixed eulerian coordinates _ , hence our drift represents an average velocity at a given eulerian position and we call it an _ eulerian drift_. the relation between the classical drift and eulerian drift represents an open question to study , while their leading terms ( in the amplitude series ) are certainly coincide . in our consideration of eulerian drift",
    "we explicitly show its different options , approximations , and appearances .",
    "we calculate first three approximations for the eulerian drift velocity that is especially useful in the cases of vanishing leading approximation .",
    "situation with _ pseudo - diffusion _ is more intriguing .",
    "first of all , the appearance of this ` diffusion - like ' term in averaged equations is surprising by itself .",
    "another surprise is the form of the pseudo - diffusion matrix which appears as a _ lie - derivative _ of an averaged _ quadratic displacement tensor_. for different flows , pseudo - diffusion can correspond to diffusion or ` anti - diffusion ' or to some intermediate cases .",
    "we make the first step in the understanding of the meaning of pseudo - diffusion by considering some simple example of rigid - body oscillations .",
    "we arrive to a surprising conclusion that the combination of the advection due to rigid - body oscillations and the eulerian averaging procedure can produce the evolution of the averaged field , which formally coincides with physical diffusion .",
    "we present five examples of flows aimed to illustrate different appearances of drift and pseudo - diffusion .",
    "these examples cover the general form of modulated oscillatory fields , stokes drift , a spherical ` acoustic ' wave , a class of velocity fields with vanishing main term of the drift , and a velocity field which provides a chaotic averaged ` lagrangian ' dynamics .",
    "it is important , that in this paper we do not use any additional assumptions , except the two - timing hypothesis itself .",
    "all the results appear from the straightforward and rigorous calculations and represent mathematical theorems , although they are not formulated explicitly in this way .",
    "hence , our results can be seen as the test on the validity and reliability of two - timing method . any failure to interpret our results physically or mathematically",
    "can be explained only by the insufficiency of two time - scales , that might mean that three time - scales ( or more ) are required .",
    "at the same time , following to a high mathematical rigour , we avoid any physical interpretations , while such interpretations could be needed in future .",
    "a fluid flow is given by its velocity field @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are cartesian coordinates and time , asterisks stand for dimensional variables .",
    "we suppose that velocity field is sufficiently smooth , but _",
    "we do not assume that it satisfies any equations of motion_. the dimensional advection equation for a scalar field @xmath4 is @xmath5 this equation describes the motions of a lagrangian marker in either an incompressible or compressible fluid , and the advection of a passive scalar admixture with concentration @xmath4 in an incompressible fluid .",
    "it is also closely relevant to various models , not related to fluid dynamics .",
    "the hyperbolic equation ( [ exact-1 ] ) has characteristics curves ( trajectories ) @xmath6 described by an ode @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are eulerian and lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the _ classical drift _ motion follows after the averaging of ( [ exact-1a ] ) , which is automatically performed for fixed lagrangian coordinates .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we consider only the equation ( [ exact-1 ] ) , which is subject of averaging for fixed eulerian coordinates , the related drift motion can be called _ eulerian drift . _ such an approach significantly simplifies calculations and is reacher on results , however the link between the classical ( lagrangian ) drift and the considered below eulerian drift emerges as a new problem to study .",
    "we accept that the field @xmath1 is oscillating in time and possesses the characteristic scales of velocity @xmath10 , length @xmath11 , and frequency @xmath12 .",
    "these three parameters give a dimensionless parameter ",
    "strouhal number @xmath13 , hence the dimensionless variables and parameters ( written below without asterisks ) _ are not unique _ ; in this paper we use the following set @xmath14 while @xmath15 has the ` two - timing ' functional form @xmath16 with constants @xmath17 we note that the scale of velocity is @xmath18 , not just @xmath10 ; such kind of ` combined ' scaling is usual for asymptotic analysis and for fluid dynamics ( for example , for viscous flows the length - scale can be chosen as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is reynolds number ) .",
    "in fact , the accepted scaling for a velocity is absolutely required for the further consideration , otherwise ( say , for @xmath21 ) the asymptotic solutions for some important cases do not exist ( see discussion ) .",
    "the appearance of two constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 reflects the fact that we have two small parameters in the equation .",
    "different options for the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 will be introduced later .",
    "physically , the restriction @xmath24 makes the variable @xmath25 ` slow ' in comparison with @xmath26 , while @xmath27 gives the smallness of a vibrational spatial amplitude .    in the accepted dimensionless variables ( after the use of the chain rule ) our main equation ( [ exact-1 ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath28 where subscripts @xmath26 and @xmath25 stand for the related partial derivatives ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent two _ mutually dependent _ variables , which are called _ slow time _ and _ fast time_. equation ( [ exact-6 ] ) can be rewritten in the form containing two independent small parameters @xmath29 hence , we study the asymptotic limit in the plane @xmath30 @xmath31 where different asymptotic paths can be prescribed by different choices of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in .",
    "each such a path may produce different solutions ; the paths which produce valid asymptotic solutions are called _ distinguished limits_.",
    "the key suggestion of the two - timing method is @xmath32 as a result , we convert , from pde with independent variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( where @xmath26 and @xmath25 are mutually dependent and expressed in terms of @xmath33 ) into pde with the extended number of independent variables @xmath35 and @xmath34 . then the solutions of , must have a functional form : @xmath36 it should be emphasized , that without the functional form of solutions can be different from ; indeed the presence of @xmath0 allows us to build an infinite number of different time - scales , not just @xmath26 and @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we accept and analyse the related averaged equations and solutions in the functional form .    in order to make further analytical progress",
    ", we introduce a few convenient notations and agreements . in this paper",
    "we assume that _ any dimensionless function _",

    "we notice that the integral of a tilde - function @xmath49 often does not belong to the tilde - class . in order to keep the result of integration in the tilde - class",
    "we should subtract the average @xmath50 , which can be rewritten as @xmath51",
    "our calculations have shown that there is a series of _ distinguished limits _ for the equation ( [ exact-6a ] ) with independent variables @xmath52 ; each distinguished limit represents the one - parametric path @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( with an integer @xmath55 ) in the plane @xmath56 ; hence ( [ exact-6a ] ) yields : @xmath57 we denote the distinguished limits as dl(@xmath58 ) ; our calculations have been performed for @xmath59 .",
    "the detailed calculations for the most interesting case @xmath60 are given in appendix .",
    "other cases @xmath61 are very similar and contain the same coefficients of the averaged equations and the same blocks of calculations as the case @xmath60 ; therefore for @xmath61 we present below some final results only . in all cases",
    "we are looking for solutions in the form of regular series @xmath62 analytical calculations contain the following two steps : ( i ) writing the equations of successive approximations and splitting each such equation into its ` bar ' and ` tilde ' parts , see ;  ( ii ) obtaining the closed systems of equations for the ` bar ' parts ; during this step one should perform a large number of integrations by parts and algebraic transformations .",
    "the results give full solutions @xmath63 in any considered approximation .",
    "the described above steps can be performed only for distinguished limits ; all other asymptotic paths produce controversial systems of equations or they are not leading to closed systems of equations for successive approximations .",

    "an intricate question arises : how to choose any particular scale of @xmath25 ?",
    "our answer is : in this case the slow time - scale is uniquely determined by the magnitude @xmath123 of @xmath124 . for every given value of @xmath23 we obtain the related slow time variable @xmath125 .",
    "it should be accepted that solutions with different @xmath23 are physically different since they correspond to different orders of a prescribed velocity field and different slow time - scales @xmath25 .",
    "\\(v ) the functional dependence between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is physically natural : the increasing of the amplitude of a given velocity ( increasing @xmath23 ) leads to the decreasing of the slow time - scale ( decreasing @xmath22 ) .",
    "in general , the transformations similar to ( [ main - eq111 ] ) produce an infinite number of _ parametric solutions _ for each case dl(1 - 4 ) .",
    "the inevitable appearance of the _ pseudo - diffusion _ terms in our averaged equations does represent an intriguing result .",
    "we have introduced the term _ pseudo - diffusion _ on the grounds of the following arguments :    \\(i ) the evolution of @xmath126 is described by an advection - pseudo - diffusion - type equation ( [ 4.21 ] ) , where the matrix of pseudo - diffusion coefficients @xmath98 can be positive , negative or sign - indefinite ; it also can change its sign in space and time ; ( ii ) the equation ( [ 4.21 ] ) is valid only for the regular asymptotic expansions ( [ 4.22])-([4.22aa ] ) , while the classical diffusion is often affiliated with the singular expansions ;    \\(iii ) for the most interesting case dl(2 ) the pseudo - diffusion term represents a known ` source ' term in the second approximation ; for dl(4 ) the pseudo - diffusion does appear already in the leading approximation , although its evolution is described by ` very ' slow time @xmath127 ;    \\(iv ) the possibility of the secular growth ( in @xmath25 ) of averaged solutions due to pseudo - diffusion represents a central open question .",
    "such secular terms could appear for the pseudo - diffusion matrix @xmath98 , which is constant or monotonically increasing in @xmath25 , but they are unlikely to appear if @xmath98 is oscillating in @xmath25 .",
    "if such a growth does appear , then the sufficiency of two time - scales only should be reconsidered .",
    "\\(v ) the appearance of pseudo - diffusion matrix as a _ lie - derivative of an averaged quadratic displacement tensor _ , represents the result of straightforward calculations , which still requires qualitative understanding .",
    "we propose the following example as a first step of such understanding .    _ : _ the simple and instructive example of a prescribed velocity is a rigid - body oscillations of a medium , where @xmath128 . due to the vanishing of all spatial derivatives ,",
    "all approximations of a drift velocity also vanish @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) and the dl(4 ) equation takes a simplified form @xmath131 there are few observations for this equation :    \\(a ) when @xmath132 ( purely periodic oscillations of a velocity ) , then @xmath133 , which leads to a steady distribution @xmath134 ; hence , any purely periodic rigid - body oscillations do not affect the averaged field @xmath135 .",
    "\\(b ) in order to obtain @xmath136 ( with @xmath137 a constant tensor ) , one has to take @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is an arbitrary tilde - function ; we note that for positive matrix @xmath137 we have a standard diffusion equation , for negative @xmath137  an ` anti - diffusion ' equation , and for a sign - indefinite matrix  a pseudo - diffusion equation .",
    "\\(c ) one can see , that for positive matrix @xmath137 the related evolution of @xmath135 is described by standard diffusion equation .",
    "however , in a contrast to classical diffusion , the mechanism of this evolution is different : this evolution is due to the growth of a spatial oscillatory amplitude as @xmath140 ; hence , the described phenomenon ( which looks like diffusion ) actually represents an advection ( by the increasing in amplitude oscillations ) , which is ` superimposed ' with the average operation .",
    "hence , we have arrived to the following striking result : the superposition of advection due to rigid - body oscillations and the eulerian averaging operation can lead to the evolution of an averaged solution , that is mathematically equivalent to the classical diffusion .",
    "\\(d ) for @xmath141 being a periodic function of @xmath25 ( which represents modulated oscillations ) , the sign of @xmath98 is periodically changing , mathematical properties of such pde are unknown , however one might expect that such an equation has bounded solutions ( secular growth is absent ) .",
    "the case when the eigenvalues of @xmath98 have different signs , has not been systematically studied yet , see @xcite .",
    "\\(e ) for understanding of applicability of one should keep in mind that all our dimensionless functions and their derivatives are of order one , hence , the consideration of solutions with large gradients ( _ e.g. _ a point source solution ) represents an invalid operation .",

    "<S> the aim of this paper is to study and classify the multiplicity of distinguished limits and asymptotic solutions for the advection equation with a general oscillating velocity field with the systematic use of the two - timing method . </S>",
    "<S> our results are :    \\(i ) the dimensionless advection equation contains _ two independent small parameters _ , which represent the ratio of two characteristic time - scales and the spatial amplitudes of oscillations ; the scaling of the variables and parameters contains strouhal number ;    \\(ii ) an infinite sequence of _ distinguished limits _ has been identified ; this sequence corresponds to the successive degenerations of a _ drift velocity _ ;    \\(iii ) we have derived the averaged and oscillatory equations for the first _ four distinguished limits _ ; derivations are performed up to the forth orders in small parameters ;    \\(v ) we have shown , that _ each distinguish limit solution _ generates an infinite number of _ parametric solutions _ ; these solutions differ from each other by the slow time - scale and the amplitude of prescribed velocity ;    \\(vi ) we have discovered the inevitable appearance of _ pseudo - diffusion _ , which appears as a lie derivative of the averaged tensor of quadratic displacements ; we have clarified the meaning of pseudo - diffusion using a simple example ;    \\(vii ) our main methodological result is the introduction of a logical order into the area and classification of an infinite number of asymptotic solutions ; we hope that it can help to study the similar problems for more complex systems ;    \\(viii ) since in our calculations we do not employ any additional assumptions , our study can be used as a test for the validity of the two - timing hypothesis ;    \\(ix ) the averaged equations for five different types of oscillating velocity fields have been considered as the examples of different drifts and pseudo - diffusion . </S>"
