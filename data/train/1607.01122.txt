    "in this work we explore the possibility whether an inhomogeneous underdamped sinusoidal potential@xcite system can be an appropriate candidate for obtaining ratchet current@xcite while simultaneously exhibiting stochastic resonance@xcite . in other words , whether in an inhomogeneous system one can obtain an optimally improved response to a subthreshold external field as the temperature is raised ( stochastic resonance ) in addition to exhibiting net asymmetric transport ( ratchet effect ) in a sinusoidal potential without the application of an external bias or with the application of an external field that , on its own , on the average , adds up to equal impulse in opposing directions .    stochastic resonance was shown earlier to occur in sinusoidal potentials@xcite contrary to its absence having been stressed previously@xcite .",
    "it follows from the realization that when driven at a suitably large frequency , an underdamped particle moving in the sinusoidal potential shows two kinds of response trajectories , one with a large amplitude ( and also large phase lag with respect to the drive ) and the other with a small amplitude ( and small phase lag ) .",
    "these solutions are quite robust and have the status of dynamical states . the characteristics that fully establish the trajectories as dynamical states are discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the motion ( trajectory ) of the particle can be in either of these two states at any given instant of time .",
    "this is especially clearly observable at lower temperatures before the occurrence of stochastic resonance .",
    "therefore , dynamically the system can be considered as bistable .",
    "the transition between these dynamical states , as the temperature is raised , can provide an explanation for the occurrence of stochastic resonance in periodic potentials .",
    "as far as the phenomenon of stochastic resonance is concerned , the sinusoidal potential thus recedes into oblivion and the problem is recast into one in a bistable system .",
    "this is important , for it is in the bistable systems that stochastic resonance is commonly observed .",
    "the two dynamical states and the transitions between them refer mostly to trajectories about the minimum within a period of the periodic potential .",
    "however , the statement , `` stochastic resonance in a periodic potential '' , is meaningful only if the motion includes not only inter-(dynamical)state transitions present but also movements between various wells ( periods ) of the potential . in other words ,",
    "the bistability must be maintained whichever period of the sinusoidal potential the particle happens to occupy as time progresses so that the full sinusoidal potential , and not just one period of it , is found to be accessed .",
    "given the criterion to be satisfied , the occurrence of stochastic resonance is discussed only in terms of the two dynamical states and any reference to the sinusoidal potential is conveniently kept silent . however , sometimes , the reference to the interwell transitions has to be alluded to in order to check the credibility of the claim of occurrence of stochastic resonance in periodic potentials .",
    "in fact , well before stochastic resonance occurs , numerous interwell transitions take place . as",
    "the temperature becomes much larger than the temperature at which stochastic resonance occurs the transitions become so frequent that the two dynamical states become hardly discernible with separate identity , for the intervals of existence of the two states become too short ( could even be less than a period ) .    by an inhomogeneous system we mean , in the present work , a system with nonuniform ( space - dependent ) friction coefficient .",
    "it has been theoretically shown earlier that an overdamped particle experiences a net effective driving force when subjected to a drift in a sinusoidal potential and also a sinusoidally modulated space - dependent diffusion , with the same period as the potential@xcite .",
    "however , diffusion coefficient @xmath0 depends on both , the temperature @xmath1 and the friction coefficient @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of temperature variation is considered dominant as it determines the local stability of states@xcite .",
    "it has been shown analytically that in an underdamped periodic potential a similarly periodic variation of temperature but with a phase difference leads to ratchet current@xcite .",
    "this remarkable result was also supported numerically in a related work@xcite .",
    "the effect of friction coefficient variation is weak and , unlike temperature variation , a mere similar periodic variation of friction coefficient is not expected to yield ratchet current ; to yield ratchet current , in this case , one needs to apply , in addition , a zero - mean external forcing@xcite .",
    "the ratchet effect has been studied in nonuniform friction periodic potential systems earlier too but mostly in the overdamped limit@xcite unlike in the present case of underdamped systems .",
    "also , the period of the drive taken earlier used to be very large , typically of the order of mean first - passage - time across a potential barrier . in these circumstances , stochastic resonance in the periodic potential systems was not found to occur and hence there was no question of exploring whether both the effects occur simultaneously in the same parameter space .    as stated earlier , in addition to the ratchet effect discussed above",
    ", the present work endeavours to observe sr simultaneously in the same parameter space .",
    "though the present work is not experimental , it is not hard to think of an easy - to - visualize experimental situation illustrating the present case .",
    "consider a series of nodes and antinodes , created by a stationary pressure wave , representing sites of alternate low and high density of the medium .",
    "a particle , therefore , while moving along longitudinally , experiences a periodic variation of friction .",
    "in addition , if the particle is charged and an alternating electric potential field , of same wavelength as the pressure wave but with a phase difference , is created the particle will experience a spatially periodic force field .",
    "the application of a temporally sinusoidal external electric field completes the illustrative experimental situation to describe the problem at hand and allows the following questions to be asked .",
    "is it possible to obtain a net ( ratchet ) current ?",
    "if a thermal noise is added and increased gradually , either through the external field or the system itself , will the response of a host of particles to the external field be sharper or more smeared ? in other words , does the quality of response , as conventionally measured by the ( output ) signal to ( input ) noise ratio , improve as the noise level is gradually increased ?",
    "if the response shows a peak ( stochastic resonance ) at an intermediate temperature ( noise strength ) does the net particle current also exhibit a maximum , simultaneously@xcite ?",
    "these are some of the questions that will be attempted to be clarified in a model system .",
    "these questions together have already been discussed earlier , however , in a uniform friction medium and subjected to a biharmonic external field@xcite , @xmath4 . in the present work , the potential is considered sinusoidal @xmath5 and an external field of @xmath6 .",
    "the asymmetry in the system is introduced via the phase shifted nonuniform friction @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . in the case of temperature inhomogeneity ,",
    "similar in form to the frictional inhomogeneity considered here , it has been shown earlier@xcite that the ratchet current @xmath9 depends on the phase difference @xmath10 between the potential function and the temperature function as @xmath11 .",
    "thus , understandably , the ratchet current is maximum when the asymmetry is maximum , namely , for @xmath12 and the same should be true in the present case of frictional inhomogeneity as well .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath12 , the inhomogeneous friction yields particle trajectories ( and stochastic resonance ) qualitatively similar to the uniform friction case in response to the same sinusoidal external field ( see sec .",
    "however , the inhomogeneous friction , in addition , helps in obtaining a net ( ratchet ) current .",
    "since , in both the cases , the trajectories show same periodicity as the external field , the particle spends almost the same time in the small and large friction regions which lie , respectively , on either side of the potential minimum .",
    "the present situation is therefore quite different from the adiabatic drive case wherein the particle is likely to spend unequal durations in the two friction regions .",
    "hence the reason put forth for the explanation of occurrence of ratchet current in the adiabatic limit will not hold in the finite frequency drive case@xcite . a closer statistical analysis of the parts of trajectories in the two separate regions , however , hints at why the net ( asymmetric ) particle current should be expected .",
    "the turning points of the trajectories on either side of potential minimum ( @xmath13 ) show interesting distributions . at very low temperatures , ( @xmath14 ) , the mean distance of turning points , @xmath15 ( in the high friction side of the potential peak ) and @xmath16 ( in the low friction side ) from @xmath13 and their standard deviations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , about the mean values on both sides are same , showing that the motion remains symmetrical on both directions , for all @xmath19 .",
    "however , as @xmath1 is gradually increased the differences show up for @xmath20 and @xmath12 . for @xmath21 and at low temperatures",
    "only large amplitude trajectories appear ( see sec .",
    "iii , fig .",
    "9 ) . in this case",
    ", one obtains @xmath22 and @xmath23 upto a reasonably large temperature . and , for @xmath24 and at low temperatures only small amplitude trajectories",
    "appear in which case one finds @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , since inter - well transitions and hence ratchet current is dominantly determined by the large amplitude trajectories , there is more likelyhood of right - to - left net transport than the other way round .",
    "of course , differences of @xmath16 and @xmath15 , etc .",
    "are very small ( less than one percent ) and the interwell transtions are thus decided by the rare large amplitude events .    in the next section ii , the model system of our study will be described . in section",
    "iii the numerical results based on our investigations will be presented in detail and in the last section iv our results will be discussed and summarised .",
    "we consider the motion of an ensemble of under - damped non - interacting brownian particles each of mass @xmath27 in a periodic potential @xmath28 .",
    "the medium in which the particle moves is taken to be inhomogeneous in the sense that it offers a spatially varying friction with coefficient @xmath29 that leads / lags the potential by a phase difference @xmath10 .",
    "this choice of friction coefficient breaks the right - left spatial symmetry of the system . here , @xmath30 is the inhomogeneity parameter , with @xmath8 and hence @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the potential is rocked by a sub - threshold periodic time - dependent forcing @xmath32 , with @xmath33 = 2@xmath34/@xmath35 as the rocking frequency and @xmath35 as the rocking period .",
    "the equation of motion of the particle subjected to a thermal gaussian white noise @xmath36 at temperature @xmath1 is given by the langevin equation@xcite , @xmath37 with @xmath38 here , and throughout the text , @xmath39 correspond to ensemble averages .    for simplicity and convenience",
    "the equation is transformed in to dimensionless units@xcite by setting @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with reduced variables denoted again by the same symbols .",
    "thus , the langevin equation takes the form @xmath43 where the potential is reduced to @xmath44 and @xmath45 equation ( 2.4 ) is numerically solved ( i.e. , integrated using ito definition ) to obtain the trajectories @xmath46 of the particle for various initial conditions@xcite . for initial positions @xmath47 the period @xmath48 is divided uniformly into either @xmath49 or @xmath50 parts ( and hence @xmath51 initial positions)and the initial velocity @xmath52 is set equal to zero throughout in the following .",
    "for each trajectory , corresponding to one initial position @xmath53 , the work done by the field @xmath54 on the system , or the input energy , is calculated as @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a large integer denoting the number of periods taken to reach the final point of the trajectory .",
    "the effective potential @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 the mean input energy per period , for the particular trajectory , is therefore given by @xmath59    for the deterministic case ( @xmath60 , for example @xmath61 ) and also at low temperatures ( low noise strengths , typically less than about 10% of the largest potential barrier corresponding to @xmath54 ) the trajectories @xmath46 appear to be periodic and similar in nature to that of @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath62 is not explicitly dependent on time , all of the contribution to @xmath63 comes from the second term in @xmath57 , eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) , because of the phase difference between @xmath54 and @xmath46 .",
    "the nonzero phase difference also implies hysteresis @xmath64 , whose area is a measure of energy dissipation per period by the system .",
    "a typical mean hysteresis loop is shown in fig.1 .",
    "not surprisingly , therefore , it turns out that the corresponding mean hysteresis loop area @xmath65 is same as @xmath66 .",
    "the overall mean input energy per period , @xmath67 , is calculated as an ( ensemble ) average over all the @xmath51 trajectories ( corresponding to all the initial positions considered ) .",
    "again , we find that @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , the mean velocity @xmath9 , over one trajectory , is calculated as @xmath69 and the overall mean ( net ) velocity or the ratchet current , @xmath70 , is calculated as the ensemble average over all the @xmath51 trajectories . typically , as discussed below , @xmath71 for small temperatures and @xmath72 for large temperatures .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is chosen to have relatively small error bars so that the qualitative features of the results ( see below ) are not obscured .     as a function of the forcing . here ,",
    "@xmath35 = 8.0 , @xmath10 = @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this loop represents a large amplitude state.,width=529,height=302 ]    the error bars are calculated assuming the numerical procedure adopted to be correct and errors occurring only due inherently to the stochastic dynamics of the system .",
    "we calculate the @xmath78 for each initial condition used to calculate @xmath79 .",
    "the deviations of these @xmath9 from the mean @xmath80 calculated as an ensemble average over all trajectories with distinct initial conditions . the standard deviations @xmath81 form the error bars .     as a function of the number of periods of",
    "the forcing used to calculate @xmath82 s .",

    "the inset in the bottom - right shows the variation of @xmath80 without error bars .",

    "however , one needs to calculate the mean values carefully .",
    "the frictional inhomogeneity provides only a weak ( left - right ) asymmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "the ratchet current @xmath70 obtained is not large and the standard deviations , @xmath81 ( errorbars ) , are not small , though smaller than the mean @xmath70 .",
    "this is especially true when the temperatures are large .",
    "therefore , whereas for smaller temperatures @xmath86 one gets sensible @xmath70 , values , say @xmath87 , when averaged over 200000 periods of the drive , it takes 500000 periods at temperatures @xmath88 to obtain similar sensible @xmath70 values .",

    "@xmath85 is the difference between the number of transitions to the left and right direction potential wells and @xmath56 is the total number of periods of @xmath54 used to obtain @xmath85 .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath70 and @xmath84 almost coincide .",
    "note that the possibility of the particle making transition to a potential well farther than the adjacent well of the starting well before getting trapped is not ruled out , though such events are rare at lower temperatures but not so rare at higher temperatures .",
    "( these events are actually observed in the trajectory plots . )",
    "this naturally brings in the question of distribution of jump lengths ( in terms of number of wells ) on either directions and hence the dependence of net displacements ( and ratchet currents ) on the distributions .",
    "however , from the matching of @xmath70 and @xmath84 in fig.3 shows that the disribution is sharply peaked at the jump length of @xmath89 , or one well - length , on either directions ; distributions are almost identical on both the directions . of course , a finite small tail of the distributions corresponding to larger lengths , at least at higher temperatures , is always there .    of course ,",
    "clearly , the quantities of our interest @xmath67 and @xmath70 depend on the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 of the external field @xmath54 . in what follows",
    "we shall keep the amplitude @xmath90 fixed and equal to 0.2 throughout .",

    "we measure them in either of the two ways : ( i ) we calculate the mean values of the quantities over several periods from the trajectories , or ( ii ) calculate from the mean hysteresis loops , fig.1 , considering this approximately to be an ellipse .",

    "therefore , a particle will experience a moderate effective damping force , of magnitude , say @xmath119 , measured roughly by the averaged product @xmath120 over a period . on the other hand , from fig.8(b )",
    ", for @xmath118 , one can see that at the bottom of the potential , where the particle velocity is expected to be large , the friction coefficient @xmath2 is small and at the peak of the potential , where the velocity should be small the friction is large .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the effective damping force experienced by the particle in this case will be smaller than @xmath119 of the former case and hence the particle will be more mobile in this case of smaller @xmath10 . from a similar",

    "one can conclude that for a given pair of ( @xmath123 ) values the effective friction coefficient @xmath122 increases with @xmath10 and hence , as can be seen in fig.9 , the total number ( @xmath125 ) of interwell transitions at a given temperature @xmath1 decreases monotonically .",

    "the inset shows the loci of constant percentages of population of the sa state in the ( @xmath35-@xmath2 ) space at @xmath127 for various @xmath10 values : 30% population of sa states when @xmath10 = 0.25@xmath34 , @xmath10 = 0.50@xmath34 and @xmath10 = 0.75@xmath34 are , respectively , depicted by red , black dotted and black dash - dotted lines , whereas for 40% population of sa states are correspondingly shown in brown , blue and purple .",
    "the point ( @xmath92=0.07,@xmath35=7.7 ) is marked in the inset.,width=566,height=377 ]    in fig.11 , the input energy @xmath67 is plotted as a function of @xmath10 for two temperatures , ( i ) @xmath93 , based on the weightage average of results for la and sa states ( figs . 6(e , f ) ) , and ( ii ) @xmath128 , for @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "at low temperatures @xmath131 strongly depends on the choice of the point @xmath114 and the variation can be explained with the help of the coexistence diagrams , fig.7 and the loci of fractions of the sa states . in the inset of fig .",
    "11 are drawn some representative loci of the fractions of the sa state for @xmath115 , and @xmath113 together around the point ( 0.07,7.7 ) in the @xmath114 space .",
    "one can find that the fractions of the sa states for @xmath121 is 38.5% , for @xmath116 it is 25% and for @xmath118 it is 17.5% . in other words , the fractions of the la states are respectively , 61.5% , 75% , and 82.5% for @xmath132 , and @xmath133 . since @xmath66 for la states",
    "are much larger compared to @xmath66 for sa states the weightage average @xmath67 decreases with @xmath10 because the fraction of la states decreases with @xmath10 .",
    "however , the @xmath66 for la and sa states are monotonically increasing as a function of @xmath10 , fig.6 , implying thereby that @xmath67 increases with @xmath10 if the fractions are kept fixed .",
    "these two opposing trends of variations of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath10 leads to the peaking behaviour of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath10 at low temperatures .",
    "however , as the temperature is increased the transitions between the la and sa states allow sa states to appear where previously only la states existed and vice versa .",
    "this makes the coexistence boundaries of fig.7 blurred and nonexistent and hence @xmath131 gets smoothened .",
    "fig.11(b ) shows that , at @xmath128 , @xmath131 is monotonic which is to be compared with @xmath70 , shown in fig.10 , showing a peak close to @xmath12 irrespective of the choice of @xmath114 point .",
    "thus , there is no correlation between energy absorption and the ratchet current , at least as far as variation with respect to @xmath10 is concerned .     as a function of @xmath1 for various @xmath35 values as indicated in the top - right corner of the figure with @xmath90 = 0.2 , @xmath92 = 0.07 , @xmath30 = 0.9 , @xmath10 = 0.50@xmath34 .",

    "invariably , stochastic resonance occurs if the region of @xmath114 space is chosen such that both the dynamical states coexist , at low temperatures ( for example , @xmath93 ) , with their fractions not too far away from 0.5 . in fig.12 , the mean",
    "energy absorbed @xmath67 is plotted against temperature for various values of @xmath35 with @xmath135 . in fig.13 ,",
    "the ratchet current @xmath70 is plotted for the same parameters . from these figures",
    "one can observe that stochastic resonance and ratchet effect do occur simultaneously in the same parameter space .",
    "note , however , that the temperatures at which @xmath67 and @xmath70 peak are widely separated ; stochastic resonance and peak of ratchet current do not occur at close by temperatures .",
    "similar results have also been obtained earlier when a homogeneous system was driven by a biharmonic forcing@xcite .",
    "figs . 12 and 13 , obtained for an inhomogeneous system driven by a sinusoidal field , are the main results of the present work and deserve further analysis .     as a function of @xmath35 at @xmath93 for the two dynamical ( la and sa ) states as indicated , with @xmath90 = 0.2 , @xmath92 = 0.07 , @xmath30 = 0.9 , @xmath10 = 0.50@xmath34 .",
    "the inset shows the variation of amplitude @xmath95 as a function of @xmath35 for both la and sa states at @xmath93 , @xmath30 = 0.9 , @xmath90 = 0.2 , @xmath10 = 0.5@xmath34 for different @xmath92 values as indicated.,width=529,height=377 ]    figure 14 shows the variation of the input energy ( or energy absorbed ) per cycle , @xmath66 , of @xmath54 as a function of the period @xmath35 of @xmath54 in the la and sa states at very low temperatures @xmath136 and @xmath135 .",
    "of course , the comparison makes sense only in the coexistence region of ( @xmath123 ) space .",
    "the trend of variation of @xmath66 qualitatively follows that of the amplitude @xmath95 of the trajectories , as indicated by the curves in the inset of the figure . the trend remains the same as the temperature",
    "is increased by a small amount .",
    "note that in the la state the system absorbs more energy per cycle than when it is in the state sa .",
    "of course , the mean input energy @xmath67 , as discussed earlier , is the weightage average of @xmath66 in the two states . in view of these results and",
    "based on the nature of variation of the curves in fig .",
    "12 at low temperatures , the set of curves in fig.12 can be put in two qualitatively distinct groups : one roughly with @xmath137 and the other with @xmath138 , though the dividing line @xmath139 is not precise .",
    "the decrease of @xmath67 due to thermal fluctuations as the temperature is raised from @xmath140 indicates transition from la state to sa state .",
    "this shows that for the former group of curves with larger @xmath35 the dynamical ( sa ) state is more stable compared to the la state . on the other hand , for the latter group of curves with lower @xmath35 the la state is more stable compared to the sa state .",
    "this is consistent with the diagram shown in fig.7 .",
    "this is also understandable because larger is the frequency ( smaller period ) of drive larger should be the phase lag and hence the la state ( with larger phase lag ) should be preferred and vice versa .",
    "we presented above the results of our calculations as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath10 for various values of @xmath92 and @xmath35 .",
    "the results are consistent with each other and bear plausible explanations . however , some detailed results as a function of @xmath35 ( or frequency , @xmath141 ) need further scrutiny , which at present we lack clear explanation for .     as a function of @xmath35",
    "is shown in fig.15(a ) and that of @xmath70 in fig.15(b ) for various small temperatures as indicated , with @xmath90 = 0.2 , @xmath92 = 0.07 , @xmath30 = 0.9 , @xmath10 = 0.50@xmath34 .",
    "the inset in fig.15(b ) , with the same axes label as the main plot , shows the two curves for lower temperatures @xmath142 and @xmath143 for clarity.,width=529,height=755 ]    in figs .",
    "15 a and b are presented the variations of @xmath67 and @xmath70 as a function of @xmath35 for @xmath135 and @xmath116 at various temperatures .",
    "particular attention may be given to the occurrence of maxima of @xmath67 and @xmath70 at low temperatures as summarized in fig.16 .",
    "values corresponding to maximum @xmath67 ( in red ) and maximum @xmath70 ( in blue ) as @xmath1 is changed , with @xmath90 = 0.2 , @xmath92 = 0.07 , @xmath30 = 0.9 , @xmath10 = 0.50@xmath34.,width=529,height=377 ]    from fig.14 , it is clear that @xmath66 for la states is much larger than for the sa states , one would , therefore , expect @xmath67 to peak just before the sa states make their appearance around @xmath144 , unless the loss due to appearance of sa states is more than compensated for by the rise of @xmath66 with increase in @xmath35 . however , the slope of @xmath145 is not so large as to offset the loss due to appearance of the sa states , yet @xmath67 peaks at a value of @xmath35 larger than 7.5 .",
    "though this anomaly is curious , the peaking of @xmath70 at low temperatures is more interesting .",
    "@xmath70 peaks at a value of @xmath146 where sa and la states are nearly equally stable .",
    "( as concluded earlier , at smaller @xmath35 the la state is more stable than sa state and vice versa . )",
    "in other words , at low temperatures , the asymmetry in the probability of crossings to the left and right wells of the periodic potential becomes the largest at that value @xmath35 for which la and sa states are equally stable !",
    "though @xmath67 and @xmath70 do not peak at the same @xmath35 values , the difference in @xmath35 values at which they peak is much smaller compared to the range of @xmath35 over which the two states coexist .",
    "however , for given values of @xmath92 and @xmath35 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 peak at widely separated temperatures , fig.16 .",
    "thus the variation of @xmath67 and @xmath70 as a function of frequency is nearer to coincidence than the peaking of @xmath67 ( stochastic resonance ) and @xmath70 as a function of temperature .    as stated earlier , frictional inhomogeneity is a comparatively weak agent to yield ratchet effect , yet the maximum ratchet current that we obtain is not negligible and there is a possibility of obtaining still larger current if the parameters are tuned suitably .",
    "for example , we have not yet completely explored the variation of @xmath67 and @xmath70 as a function of @xmath92 which may yield larger ratchet current .    in summary , we are closer to finding answer to all questions that we had mentioned to begin with",
    ". we could observe stochastic resonance and ratchet effect in the same region of parameter space .",
    "however , sr and ratchet current peak do not occur at the same temperature .",
    "we now have a better idea about the relative roles played by the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath30 characterising the frictional inhomogeneity and also the periodicity @xmath35 of the external periodic field to obtain @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
