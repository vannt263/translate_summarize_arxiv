    "we show that the absence of long - range magnetic order in the nearly isotropic organic antiferromagnet @xmath10 can be understood in terms of strongly enhanced quantum spin fluctuations due to finite @xmath1-induced competing interactions and frustration .",

    "the realization in the triangular lattice of a non - magnetic insulator state at intermediate @xmath1 , in which magnetic ordering is suppressed by strong quantum spin fluctuations , is interesting as it allows , with decreasing @xmath1 , for a mott - type metal - insulator transition not accompanied by any magnetic symmetry breaking . in this context ,",
    "another quantum correction which assumes significance is that for the af band gap .",

    "a highly asymmetric doping behaviour was obtained for electron and hole doping , when the _ intraband _ particle - hole processes were incorporated in the spin - fluctuation propagator .",
    "while hole doping was found to initially stabilize the af state and actually increase the spin stiffness by suppressing the intrinsic frustration , any electron doping was found to destroy the @xmath0 af ordering .",
    "in fact , the stabilization for hole doping and instability for electron doping , with nearly concentration independent negative spin stiffness , closely resembles the doping behaviour of the square - lattice af within the @xmath24-hubbard model for positive @xmath35 .    finally , whether a non - magnetic insulator intervenes between the paramagnetic metal and the af insulator depends on the relative strengths of the quantum corrections to magnetic order and af band gap . in case",
    "the af band gap closes before the magnetic order is lost , the magnetic transition is pre - empted , leaving a ( nearly ) first - order afi - pm transition , when the af bands start overlapping , possibly with an intervening afm phase in a narrow @xmath1 range . in this context ,",
    "quantum corrections to quasiparticle dispersion and band gap due to motion of an added hole ( electron ) in the @xmath0 ordered af background are presently under investigation .",
    "helpful discussions with z. teanovi and v. ashwin are gratefully acknowledged ."
