    "the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) is one of the most frequently used methods in the theoretical study of vibrational collective excitations in low - energy physics .",
    "these collective modes include the low - lying vibrations and high - lying giant resonances . within the rpa ,",
    "these vibrational excitations are generated by the coherent superpositions of elementary excitations .",
    "for instance , the electric multipole excitations @xmath2",
    "( @xmath3 , etc . ) , including the isoscalar ( is ) and isovector ( iv ) giant resonances , consist of many particle - hole ( ph ) components .",
    "the basic assumption of the rpa is the quasi - boson approximation ( qba ) , which implies that the operators of ph pairs behave like ideal bosons , ignoring the pauli principle owing to their fermion structure .",
    "algebraically , the qba is the replacement of the exact commutation relation between the ph pair operators @xmath4 $ ] with its expectation value @xmath5|hf\\rangle$ ] in the hartree - fock ( hf ) ground state , where @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the particle ( p ) creation and hole ( h ) annihilation operators , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this assumption perfectly holds when the rpa vibrations consist of many coherent ph excitations , for instance in the case of high - lying collective excitations such as the giant resonances or low - lying ones such as the first @xmath9 or @xmath10 states in medium and heavy nuclei , where the concept of a nuclear mean field works very well .",
    "however , in light nuclei the validity of the mean - field concept and the qba itself become questionable .",
    "hence it becomes necessary to take into account properly the fermion structure of the ph pairs , removing in this way the violation of the pauli principle .",
    "there have been several methods to preserve the pauli principle between the ph pairs by including the correlations in the ground state , which are neglected within the qba .",
    "these correlations are referred to as the ground - state correlations ( gsc ) beyond rpa . among the earliest approaches to include gsc beyond rpa , the one proposed by hara  @xcite is rather transparent and simple because it evaluates the expectation value @xmath11|0\\rangle$ ] of the commutation relation @xmath4 $ ] in the correlated rpa ground state @xmath12 by using the diagonal approximation , resulting in the particle and hole occupation numbers , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the latter are approximately expressed in terms of the rpa backward - going amplitudes @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to the renormalized rpa ( rrpa ) equation , nonlinear with respect to the amplitudes @xmath15 , which can be solved by iteration . in the rrpa equation",
    "the residual interactions are renormalized by the so - called gsc factor @xmath16 , which is a function of @xmath17 .    in a later development , catara , dang and sambataro derived in ref .",
    "@xcite an equation for the gsc factor @xmath18 , which recovers the expression for @xmath19 , which was obtained by hara in the limit of small @xmath15 .",
    "it has been shown by dukelsky and schuck that this equation produces the exact expression for the gsc factor in the equidistant multilevel pairing model  @xcite . however , the application of the rrpa using this gsc factor @xmath18 has been limited so far only to the energy and @xmath20 value of the lowest @xmath21 state in @xmath22gd and @xmath23pb  @xcite .",
    "the rrpa was also studied by using the equations of motion method in ref . @xcite and the green s functions techniques in ref .",
    "an alternative derivation of the occupation numbers by using the number - operator method was carried out in refs .",
    "this method was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain an expression for the gsc factor @xmath18 within the improved rpa up to the order of @xmath24 , which was applied to the calculations in metallic clusters .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that , due to the gsc beyond the rpa , the energy the @xmath21 state in these two nuclei increases upward , leading to the significant decrease of around 40@xmath25 and 20@xmath25 in the associate @xmath20 values in @xmath22gd and @xmath23pb , respectively .",
    "these effects are more pronounced than those predicted for the low - lying @xmath26 states  @xcite .",
    "no investigation was carried out for the @xmath27 states , whose first moment @xmath28 , known as the energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) , is the most important . for the @xmath29 transitions ,",
    "this ewsr is related to the model - independent thomas - reich - kuhn sum rule trk = 60 nz / a ( mev mb ) for the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in a nucleus with a nucleons ( n neutrons and z protons ) . when a velocity - dependent effective interaction , such as the skyrme one , or the meson - exchange interaction is used , the velocity - dependent and/or exchange terms contribute to the iv multipole sum rules .",
    "the iv @xmath29 ewsr then exceeds the trk as trk@xmath30 with 0@xmath31 1  @xcite .",
    "the rpa ( with the velocity - independent interaction ) fulfills the gdr sum rule .",
    "however , being multiplied by the factor @xmath18 , the rrpa matrix elements of the ph interactions are reduced .",
    "this leads not only to a shift down of the gdr energy but also to a decrease in the @xmath32 values , causing the violation of the gdr sum rule .",
    "the problem of model - independent sum rule violation within the rrpa was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors attributed the origin of the problem to the adopted structure of both the hamiltonian and the transition operators , which neglect the scattering terms coming from the particle - particle ( pp ) and hole - hole ( hh ) transitions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the improved rpa does not fulfill the ewsr as well . a practical idea to restore the ewsr within the rrpa",
    "was suggested in the same paper in the same spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite by noticing that the transition operator , in general has not only a ph part but also the particle - particle ( pp ) and hole - hole ( hh ) ones .",
    "therefore , in order to restore the ewsr , the rrpa transition amplitudes should contain also the contributions from the pp and hh transitions .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the importance of the pp and hh transitions were evident already in the studies of the finite - temperature rpa ( ft - rpa ) in the 1970s - 1980s , where the ft - rpa equations were derived and studied in details  @xcite .",
    "the ft - rpa equations , which were derived in these papers for the separable interactions , are formally identical to the rrpa ones if the ph transitions are considered .",
    "the only difference is that the single occupation numbers @xmath33 within the ft - rpa are described by the fermi - dirac distributions for non - interacting fermions at finite temperature @xmath34 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the gdr energy decreases with increasing @xmath34 for the ph transitions within the ft - rpa , because @xmath18 becomes smaller than 1 and decreases with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "however , after the pp and hh transitions are included together with the ph ones , the gdr energy remains nearly the same as its value when @xmath35 0 at @xmath34 varies up to 4 mev .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 eswrs also remain essentially constant up to @xmath35 2 mev . as for the iv @xmath29 excitations with thin the ft - rpa , the results of calculations obtained for @xmath38ca , including ph as well as pp and hh transitions by using a zero - range force in ref .",
    "@xcite have also shown that the ewsr remains nearly constant up to temperature @xmath35 6 mev .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the skyrme force sgii was used in calculations . with increasing the number of neutrons , a phenomenon called pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr )",
    "is predicted in neutron - rich nuclei and a number of theoretical and experimental studies were devoted to its properties in the recent years @xcite .",
    "the pdr has often been interpreted as a manifestation of the oscillation of the weakly - bound neutron skin against the isospin - symmetric core of protons and neutrons , although this picture is rather sketchy . as a matter of fact",
    ", the nature of the pdr still remains an issue open to debate .",
    "different theoretical models still do not agree on its collectivity and coherence . for example , while the relativistic random - phase approximation predicted a prominent peak below 10 mev in @xmath39sn and @xmath40zr  @xcite , which is identified as the collective pdr ,",
    "the results of calculations including monopole pairing within the quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) show only a group of slightly collective states @xcite in @xmath41sn , whereas for @xmath39sn  @xcite no collective @xmath29 states are even seen in the low - energy region . as the pdr",
    "is located in a low energy region , the effect of gsc beyond the rpa , which are included in the phrrpa , should be taken into account in the study of the pdr .",
    "this study should be complementary to those , which include 2p-2h excitations such as the second rpa  @xcite , the relativistic rpa plus phonon - coupling model  @xcite , the quasiparticle - phonon model  @xcite , a version of which includes even couplings upto 3p3h configurations in terms of three - phonon components  @xcite .",
    "however , the major drawback , as mentioned above as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that all extensions of the rpa to the rrpa so far violate the energy - weighted sum rules ( ewsrs ) for is and iv dipole excitations .    obviously , in order to restore the @xmath29 sum rule",
    ", one should derive and solve the complete set of rrpa equations that include all the ph , as well as pp and hh configurations .",
    "the transition probabilities , which are calculated based on these solutions , should also include all ph , pp , and hh transitions .",
    "this is undoubtedly a formidable task , which we are now working on . in the present paper , as a preparatory study , we would like to see if the problem can be resolved in an approximate and simple way , which can nonetheless be applied in practical calculations of electric dipole excitations .",
    "to this end , we modify the computer code for self - consistent rpa with skyrme - type interactions , which has been developed by col and collaborators  @xcite , to include the effect of gsc beyond the rpa following the method proposed in ref .",
    "the dipole ewsrs are restored by perturbatively taking into account also the contribution of pp and hhole configurations , which have been neglected so far in all practical calculations within the rrpa .",

    "the computer code for the self - consistent hf - rpa with skyrme - type interactions , developed by col and collaborators  @xcite , is modified to include the effect of gsc beyond rpa .",
    "this code is restricted to the calculations of natural - parity states having @xmath200 in spherical nuclei with filled subshells , that is without partial occupancies .",
    "the single - particle energy spectra for neutrons and protons are discretized and superfluid pairing is not included .",
    "regarding the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction , the density - dependent skyrme interactions are employed in the calculations .",
    "the code first carries out the hf calculations for a specified nucleus using a given skyrme - type interaction .",
    "the hf single particle energies , wave functions and densities , which are obtained in a radial mesh extending to @xmath201 ( fm ) and cut - off energy @xmath202 of unoccupied states , are then used in solving the rpa equation . as for the phrrpa and rrpa equations",

    "we restrict ourselves to studying the is and iv dipole states in @xmath0ca and @xmath1zr isotopes . for the skyrme interactions , we employ the sly5 force , whose",
    "parameters have been specified and used in the hf - rpa code in a spherical box with radius @xmath203 15 fm and the cut - off energy @xmath204 60 mev of unoccupied states .",
    "this value has been chosen because , for the iv e1 excitations in the nuclei under consideration , the energy of the lowest rpa state decreases very slowly with increasing @xmath202 higher than 60 mev . a value @xmath205 0.4 mev for the smoothing parameter is used in calculating the strength function ( [ strength ] ) .",
    "and the corresponding strength functions @xmath206 for @xmath207ca [ ( a ) and ( d ) ] , @xmath208ca [ ( b ) and ( e ) ] , and @xmath209ca [ ( c ) and ( f ) ] obtained within the rpa , phrrpa , and rrpa . the solid and dashed vertical bars denote the @xmath32 values obtained within the rpa and phrrpa , respectively .",

    "the results are obtained by using the sly5 interaction with the summation taken from 0 to @xmath213 60 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table3 ]    shown in figs .",
    "[ be1ca ] and [ be1zr ] are the is and iv dipole distributions in calcium and zirconium isotopes obtained within the rpa , phrrpa , and rrpa .",
    "the values of the energy shift @xmath194 in eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) are chosen equal to 1 mev for calcium isotopes , 1.5 mev for both @xmath214zr and @xmath215zr , and 1.4 mev for @xmath216zr",
    ". it is seen from these figures that , as compared to the rpa results , the overall is strengths obtained within the phrrpa are always smaller , whereas the phrrpa iv strength distribution is slightly shifted to the lower excitation energy with an increase in the total strength at the low - energy side of the gdr main peak and a depletion strength at its high - energy side . as the result of these shifts in the distributions of the is and iv strengths ,",
    "the ewsrs calculated within the phrrpa are significantly reduced , as shown in the 5@xmath217 and 9@xmath217 columns of table [ table1 ] . for the is excitations , the largest value of @xmath218 amounts to only 92.0@xmath25 for @xmath214zr , whereas the smallest value is 86.98@xmath25 for @xmath208ca . for the iv excitations , the value of @xmath219 ranges from 0.97 to 1.04 .",
    "the first excited is state , which is the spurious mode caused by the center - of - mass motion , is shifted up within the phrrpa . however , in all the cases under consideration , this increase in the energy of the spurious mode is not large and the associated @xmath32 values are negligible .",
    "similar to the rpa case , the phrrpa spurious mode is still well separated from all physical states located at higher energies , and therefore does not affect these states . within the rrpa",
    ", there are several is and iv transition strengths caused by the pp excitations ( green dotted vertical bars ) , but only few enhanced strengths are seen in the is distributions , especially in @xmath207ca and @xmath220zr , whereas those seen in the iv distribution are quite small .",
    "the transitions associated with hh excitations are found to be negligible in the present calculations and , therefore , not shown in the figures .",
    "the largest iv transition strengths associated with the pp excitations are seen in the low energy ( pdr ) region , which slightly redistributes the pdr strengths , especially for calcium isotopes . adding the transition strengths associated with the pp excitations , the ewsrs obtained within the rrpa are fully recovered for both the is and iv excitations as seen in the 4@xmath217 and 8@xmath217 columns of table [ table1 ] , respectively .",
    "this result is particularly interesting because it reveals the reason why all extensions of rpa so far violate the ewsrs : they have neglected the transitions associated with the pp and hh excitations .",
    "to have a deeper look inside the effects of gsc beyond the rpa , we report in table [ table2 ] the centroid energies @xmath221 , which are defined as @xmath222 , where @xmath28 is calculated from eq . and",
    "@xmath223 , obtained within the rpa , phrrpa , and rrpa for the is and iv strength distributions .",
    "for the is mode , as compared to the rpa , @xmath221 obtained within the phrrpa increases slightly , whereas a significant increase in @xmath221 obtained within the rrpa is observed , implying the significant contribution of the pp and hh strengths . for the iv mode , @xmath221 obtained within the phrrpa is always lower than that obtained within the rpa , whereas the rrpa centroid energy increases to be closer to the data obtained from the empirical fitting of the experimental centroid energy @xcite as compared to the rpa one , except for @xmath214zr nucleus .",
    "once again , this increase in the centroid energy obtained within the rrpa for the iv mode shows the important contribution of the pp and hh transitions .    to see the contribution of the pdr to the total @xmath32 strength , we present in table [ table3 ] the ratio @xmath224 of the energy weighted sum of strength ( ewss ) of the pdr to that of the gdr , where @xmath225 .",
    "the summation is taken within 0@xmath226 10 mev for the pdr and 0@xmath226 60 mev for the gdr .",
    "the values of @xmath227 increase from almost 0@xmath25 in the stable nuclei , such as @xmath207ca and @xmath214zr , to about 4@xmath25 in very neutron - rich nuclei , such as @xmath209ca and @xmath216zr .",
    "as compared to the rpa , the phrrpa increases the ratio @xmath227 in most nuclei under consideration , except in @xmath208ca , whereas this ratio is significantly enhanced within the rrpa due to the contributions of the pp transition strengths in the pdr region .",
    "the present work studies the effects of gsc beyond rpa on is and iv strength distributions in calcium and zirconium isotopes . the self - consistent rpa code using skyrme interactions",
    "@xcite has been modified and applied in the numerical calculations to include the effects of gsc beyond rpa within the phrrpa  @xcite . to restore the ewsr , which is violated within the phrrpa",
    ", we propose a simple rrpa calculations taking into account , in addition to the ph excitations , the contribution of the pp and hh excitations in a perturbative way , which increases the total energy - weighted sum of strengths , including those from the ph ones .",
    "1 - although gsc beyond rpa shift up the energy of the spurious mode obtained within the phrrpa and increases the corresponding b(e1 ) value for the is spurious transition , this increase however is not large and the phrrpa spurious mode is still well separated from all physical states .",
    "2 - gsc beyond rpa reduces the transition strengths associated with the is mode , whereas it slightly increases the total strength on the low - energy region ( the pdr region ) and decreases the strength on the other side ( the gdr region ) leading to a significant decrease of the ewsrs for both the is and iv modes obtained within the phrrpa .",
    "this violation of the sum rule is then fully recovered by taking into account the contribution of pp and hh excitations within the rrpa .",
    "this result reveals the reason why all the rpa extensions that do not take into account the pp and hh excitations violate the ewsrs .",
    "3 - the ratio of the pdr ewss to the gdr one , which is almost zero in stable nuclei , increases with the neutron number . as compared to the rpa case",
    ", this ratio is in general significantly larger within the rrpa .    in the present rrpa calculations , for feasibility and simplicity of numerical calculations ,",
    "the contribution of the pp and hh excitations is considered approximately in an perturbative way . to perform the complete rrpa calculations",
    ", we need to employ the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite or @xcite in a fully self - consistent way , as has been mentioned previously .",
    "moreover , the exact superfluid pairing , which has been shown to have a non - negligible effect on the pdr  @xcite , is neglected in the present study .",
    "the extension of the hf mean - field approach incorporated with the rrpa into the renormalized quasiparticle rpa , taking into account the pp and hh excitations together with exact pairing , remains one of the goals in our future study .",
