    "quantum control theory is an important part of modern quantum information theory and a basic field of quantum computation . actually , every model of a quantum computer has to be justified by control theoretic considerations as its elementary transformations have to be achievable by controlling parameters of a real physical system .",
    "even the definition of quantum complexity relies on the available _ resources _ for computation .",
    "the resources may for instance be one- or two - qubit gates @xcite , bipartite interactions @xcite a multi - particle interaction @xcite , certain types of measurements @xcite or whatever . to understand what is easy and what is difficult to compute in nature various models have to be studied .    in the control theoretic model studied here we consider @xmath0 qubits that are addressed and controlled by a quantum controller that is given by a single qubit .",
    "we assume that there is no possibility to directly address the @xmath0-qubit register . in sections",
    "[ group],[simple ] , and [ gates ] we assume that each of the @xmath0 qubits that should be controlled interact with the control qubit via a fixed interaction .    the main part of this paper describes procedures for measuring joint observables .",
    "the usual approach of quantum computation is that single qubit measurements are elementary and that measurements of arbitrary joint observables can be reduced to those `` basic '' measurements by implementing an appropriate unitary operation in advance .",
    "more explicitly , this can be done as follows :    if the observable @xmath1 is non - degenerate , i.e. , it has @xmath2 different eigenvalues , one can implement a unitary @xmath3 with the property that @xmath4 is diagonal with respect to any basis that consists only of tensor product states and measure in this basis afterwards . in case one",
    "wants to achieve that the system is in an eigenstate of @xmath1 afterwards one can implement @xmath5 after the measurement . for degenerate @xmath1 with spectral decomposition @xmath6 one can use an ancilla register having at least @xmath7 basis states and implement a unitary transformation @xmath8 such that @xmath9 for all register states @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a fixed initial state of the ancilla register and @xmath12 are mutual orthogonal vectors .",
    "then one can measure the ancilla system and obtains a measurement of the observable @xmath1 with corresponding state reduction in the sense of the von - neumann projection postulate .",
    "this method to measure joint observables reduces the question of their _ complexity _ completely to the complexity of the required unitary transformations . in this model",
    "the single qubit observables are the most elementary ones by definition .",
    "in contrast , we emphasize that every measurement , whether it is a single - qubit observable or a complex joint observable , relies on interactions between the considered system with the environment ( the measurement apparatus ) .",
    "depending on the structure of the interaction between register and measurement apparatus the time evolution may transport _ directly _ some information about the _",
    "joint _ state of the register to the apparatus .",
    "the question studied here is how to construct measurement algorithms for joint observables and we show some examples of non - trivial joint observables that can be measured by comparably simple control operations . in other words , we would like to know which kind of information transfer to the measuring device is `` done by the interaction '' without much external control .",
    "therefore we assume to have a fixed interaction between probe particle and measuring device .",
    "we do not claim the model used here to be `` the ultimate setting '' to discuss the complexity of joint measurements .",
    "however , it has some nice features :    * the measuring device is as small as possible ( with respect to its register size ) . if the measuring device would be a large system too the set of observables that are easy to measure would depend on the set of basic observables of the measuring device . to avoid this kind of circularity in treating the question of complexity of observables we have to keep the measuring device small . *",
    "the set of extern control possibilities is extremely restricted as we only allow one - qubit operations on the control spin .",
    "if transformations on the register would be allowed the complexity of measurement procedures would rather depend on the set of available transformations on the register than on the interaction with the environment .",
    "processes where the `` measuring device '' is a quantum mechanical probe particle are sometimes called _",
    "premeasurements _ as they do not describe the interface between the classical and the quantum world ( we do not address this deep problem here ) .",
    "the simplicity of the measuring device makes it possible to describe the instructions of the measurement process as a sequence of operations in the unitary group @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , the use of control operations in finite subgroups of @xmath13 makes is possible to formulate the design of measurement processes as a group theoretical problem .",
    "more explicitly , we assume the interaction between the single qubit and the register to be given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 for @xmath16 is the pauli matrix @xmath17 acting on register qubit @xmath18 and the matrices @xmath17 on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ wwe ] ) operate on the hilbert space of the control qubit . for the following hypothetical system",
    "this hamiltonian is an appropriate approximation : let the register consist of nuclear spins and the controller be an electron spin . due to different gyro - magnetic factors ,",
    "the magnetic moment of a nucleus is considerably smaller than the magnetic moment of an electron .",
    "therefore we neglect the magnetic interactions among the nuclear spins .",
    "we assume that the nuclei have different distances @xmath19 from the electron .",
    "hence they interact with different interaction strength @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    [ 3sp ]    abstractly speaking , we have a composed system with hilbert space @xmath21 where @xmath22 , an interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 are self - adjoint operators on @xmath25 . furthermore we assume that unitary operations @xmath26 on the controller can be implemented arbitrarily fast , i.e. , the time required for the measuring process is essentially determined by the interacting between register and probe particle .    in section [ group ]",
    "we describe how to measure the observable @xmath27 if @xmath28 is an arbitrary two - valued function on the spectrum of @xmath29 with @xmath16 .",
    "in section [ simple ] we present some examples for joint observables that are simple to measure in our setting . in section [ gates ]",
    "we show that usual two qubit gates can be implemented efficiently if the strength of the interaction between different qubits and the controller can be varied , for instance when the position of the probe particle changes .",
    "first we describe two simple tricks to convert the interaction @xmath30 to one of the interactions @xmath31 by operating on the controller only : the first method is to intersperse the natural time evolution by fast implementations of @xmath32-rotations on the controller .",
    "if the time intervals are made arbitrarily small , the interaction converges to the average hamiltonian @xmath33 ( `` selective decoupling '' techniques , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , one can apply a strong magnetic field in @xmath34 or @xmath35 direction at the position of the electron spins . to see that a strong field in @xmath35-direction cancels the @xmath36 and @xmath37-terms note that the time average of @xmath38 over the interval @xmath39 $ ] vanishes .",
    "hence the interaction term @xmath40 is approximatively cancelled as long as @xmath41 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath42 .",
    "now we describe how to measure two - valued observables @xmath43 using the interaction @xmath44 if @xmath43 denotes the operator obtained by application of @xmath28 in the sense of operator functional calculus . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath45 has the eigenvalues @xmath46 .",
    "up to a translation and a time scaling factor , this is the case when @xmath47 .",
    "note that the translation of the spectrum of @xmath45 corresponds to an additional term proportional to @xmath48 for the probe spin hamiltonian that is not mentioned explicitly in the following .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath20 may be achievable by appropriate distances @xmath19 between register spin @xmath18 and the controller spin .    after the time @xmath49 the system evolution is given by @xmath50 if the register is in an eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath18 the controller evolves according to @xmath51 we describe therefore the total time evolution as @xmath52 and external unitary operations @xmath26 ( where @xmath53 denotes teh identity ) on the controller as @xmath54 in both cases , the @xmath18-th component ( note that the counting begins with @xmath55 ) of the direct product describes the transformation if eigenvalue @xmath18 is present .",
    "the evolution caused by the interaction has therefore the abstract form @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "it is a _ conditional _",
    "transformation on the control qubit depending on the state of the register .",
    "note that every transformation of this form can be implemented : conjugate the conditional transformation @xmath58 by an unconditional operation @xmath59 on the controller and obtain the conditional transformation @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be an arbitrary function .",
    "then an algorithm for measuring @xmath43 must have the property that eigenvalues @xmath62 of @xmath45 with @xmath63 lead to mutual orthogonal controller states and to equal controller states if @xmath64 .",
    "we can achieve this by a sequence of conditional and unconditional transformations that implements the conditional transformation @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an element of order @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we interpret the transformations as rotations of the controller s bloch vector .",
    "then we describe each step of the measurement procedure as an element of @xmath70 and the resulting transformation is a rotation by @xmath71 degree in the @xmath18-th component of the direct product if and only if @xmath72 .",
    "one can initialize the controller spin in such a way that its bloch vector is orthogonal to the rotation axis and achieves that the resulting states of the controller are perfectly distinguishable for different values @xmath73 .",
    "this justifies the following definition :    * definition * let @xmath28 be a function @xmath74 .",
    "an algorithm for measuring @xmath28 with @xmath7 steps is a sequence @xmath75 where each @xmath76 is of the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 or @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary element of @xmath81 such that @xmath82 with @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that it is irrelevant which element @xmath80 of order @xmath67 is chosen since they can be transformed into each other by conjugation with unitaries on the controller . the construction of this kind of measurement procedures has been discussed in @xcite by lie - algebraic methods .",
    "here we are interested in a more explicit design of procedures that does not refer to an infinite number of infinitesimal transformations .",
    "if one restricts the attention to conditional and unconditional transformations in a finite group @xmath83 , the construction of measurement procedures reduces to a word problem in the group @xmath84 and computer algebra software can be used to solve it .",
    "we checked , for instance , that the elements @xmath85 and @xmath77 with @xmath86 in the alternating group @xmath87 generate the whole group @xmath88 .",
    "this means that every function on @xmath89 equidistant eigenvalues can in principle be measured by @xmath87-transformations on the controller .",
    "the group @xmath87 is the symmetry group of dodecahedron and the icosahedron .",
    "if @xmath90 has the order @xmath67 there exists two opposite corners of the dodecahedron or icosahedron that are permuted by @xmath66 .",
    "if the probe spin is initialized to one of them one can distinguish the transformations @xmath66 and @xmath53 by measuring the resulting state .",
    "now we show that a measurement process exists for every @xmath91 and every two - valued function @xmath28 if one does not restrict the attention to a specific finite group but combine transformations of different finite groups .",
    "the following argument shows that it is sufficient to construct measurements for the functions @xmath92 with @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denote the kronecker symbol .",
    "an arbitrary function @xmath28 can be written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is appropriate subset of @xmath97 .",
    "since the xor operation @xmath98 corresponds to a concatenation of measurement procedures we can restrict our attention to each @xmath92 .",
    "we construct measurements for all @xmath92 by the following recursive scheme : we assume that we have already constructed a procedure for measuring the function @xmath99 that is defined by @xmath100 if and only if @xmath101 .",
    "now we describe the measurement for @xmath102 .",
    "let the measurement procedure for @xmath99 implement @xmath103 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary 180 degree rotation .",
    "let @xmath104 be a rotation by @xmath105 , i.e. , @xmath106 around an axis orthogonal to the axis of @xmath80 .",
    "then the recursion runs as follows :    1 .",
    "implement the conditional transformation @xmath107 2 .",
    "implement the unconditional transformation @xmath108 3 .",
    "call the measurement procedure for @xmath99 , i.e. , implement @xmath109 4 .   implement the inverse of the transformation in 1 , i.e. , @xmath110 5 .",
    "implement the unconditional transformation @xmath111 6 .",
    "call the measurement procedure for @xmath99 again .",
    "the resulting transformation implements on the @xmath18-th component the @xmath81-rotation @xmath112 for every @xmath113 the rotation is the identity since expression ( [ ausdr ] ) reduces to @xmath114 due to @xmath115 now we distinguish between the two remaining cases @xmath116    in the first case expression ( [ ausdr ] ) reduces to @xmath117 this is the identity since 180 degree rotations around mutual orthogonal axis commute .    for @xmath118 expression ( [ ausdr ] )",
    "is equal to @xmath119 since @xmath120 commutes with @xmath80 .",
    "hence we obtain a rotation by 180 degree since @xmath121 is a 90 degree rotation and the commutator between a 180 degree rotation and a 90 degree rotation around mutual orthogonal axis is a 180 degree rotation . by iteration of this scheme we can implement the function @xmath122 for every arbitrary @xmath123 .",
    "chosing @xmath124 such that @xmath125 we have a measurement procedure for @xmath92 .",
    "the number of necessary conditional transformations for measuring @xmath92 is then of the order @xmath126 since the measurement of @xmath102 uses the measurement of @xmath99 twice .",
    "hence the complexity of the measurement is linear in @xmath91 , i.e. , exponential in the number of qubits .",
    "we have already mentioned that measurement procedures for two functions @xmath28 and @xmath86 can concatenated to measurements for @xmath127 .",
    "there is also a simple rule to combine two measurements to obtain @xmath128 .",
    "for doing so we have to achieve that @xmath28 and @xmath86 implement @xmath66 and @xmath80 respectively with the property that @xmath66 and @xmath80 are elements of @xmath129 with the property that @xmath130 is an element of the order @xmath67 .",
    "the group @xmath129 is the symmetry group of the cube and the octahedron .",
    "we can implement the measurement for @xmath86 followed by the measurement of @xmath28 and repeat both procedures and we have implemented the transformation @xmath131 i.e. , a measurement for @xmath128 . note that this kind of `` computation on a single qubit '' is similar to the so - called rom - based computation in @xcite .",
    "the scheme presented in section  [ group ] for generic functions @xmath28 involves a rather large number of transformations .",
    "it is straightforward to ask which joint observables are simple to measure . referring more specificly to our model",
    "it would be interesting to know which functions require only rather short sequences of transformations .",
    "the following observation is obvious : the basic observable in our model is given by @xmath132 which was defined as @xmath133 in section  [ group ] .",
    "this measurement does not require any unitary operations on the control spin , we have only to initialize the probe spin orthogonal to the @xmath35 axis and wait for the time @xmath134 .",
    "then the probe spin rotates @xmath71 degree if the register state is an eigenstate of @xmath45 with odd eigenvalue and rotates a multiple of @xmath135 if the eigenvalue is even .",
    "if all spins are coupled to the probe spin with equal interaction strength , this process measures the parity of the binary word in the register . if the strengths of the couplings are @xmath136 the process measures the observable @xmath137 for the spin with the _ weakest _ coupling .",
    "single qubit - observables for the other qubits seem to be less simple to measure .",
    "note that the other functions @xmath99 for @xmath138 ( which are relative elementary in our scheme ) are not single qubit observables since they refer to the states of at least @xmath7 qubits .",
    "now we show how to measure the function @xmath139 using conditional and unconditional transformations in the dihedral group @xmath140 , the symmetry group of the octagon .",
    "we have checked that all two - valued functions with periodicity @xmath141 ( i.e. @xmath142 ) can be measured by a sequence in @xmath143 some of the functions with periodicity @xmath141 can be implemented by a sequence of @xmath144 steps and some functions can even be measured by sequences of length @xmath67 . since it would not give any insights to consider all of them , we will only describe the procedure for @xmath139 . for two qubits with coupling strengths @xmath145 and @xmath67 , respectively , this is simply the and function ( in section  [ gates ] we will use this procedure to implement a controlled - phase - gate on two qubits ) , in general it measures whether the content of the register is equal to @xmath144 modulo @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath66 be a rotation by @xmath146 degree around the @xmath35 axis .",
    "consider @xmath66 as an element of the dihedral group @xmath140 .",
    "initialize the probe spin to an arbitrary state in the @xmath147-plane .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only the eigenvalues @xmath148 since we use only transformations @xmath59 with @xmath149 and therefore the probe particle evolves in the same way for @xmath18 and @xmath150 .",
    "then we use the conditional transformation @xmath151 fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the positions of the resulting states for the eigenvalues @xmath152 .",
    "[ 8pos ]    then we implement the conditional transformation @xmath153 where @xmath80 is a 180 degree rotation in @xmath140 around the axis going through point 1 and 5 in fig .",
    "the effect is that the state is fixed for all even eigenvalues and mirrored at the @xmath154-line for all odd values .",
    "the resulting states are shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) .    by implementing @xmath155",
    "the state of the probe spin evolves to the positions shown in fig  2.(c ) .",
    "the states for the eigenvalues group in two classes @xmath156 and @xmath157 lying on the opposite side of the bloch sphere .",
    "hence we can distinguish those two classes by measuring the probe spin .",
    "the measurement procedure presented here consists of @xmath144 conditional transformations ( `` steps '' ) . it would be interesting to know which other observables allow simple measurement procedures .",
    "note that the only function that can be measured in one step is the parity function .",
    "this is easy to see : if the conditional transformation @xmath158 should only contain rotations by 180 degree , one can only have @xmath159",
    "the implementation of gates on @xmath0 spins by addressing only the control spin can directly be performed by measuring procedures .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath0-spin transformation that is diagonal in the @xmath137-basis .",
    "furthermore assume that @xmath3 has only two distinct eigenvalues .",
    "they can assumed to be @xmath160 w.l.o.g .",
    "then we have @xmath161 for some function @xmath162 .",
    "apply the following scheme : ( 1 ) initialize the control spin in the state @xmath11 with respect to the @xmath137 basis .",
    "( 2 ) perform a measurement of @xmath28 .",
    "( 3 ) implement @xmath163 on the control spin .",
    "( 3 ) repeat the measurement process ( note that our kind of measurements are their own inverse ) .    by selecting interactions @xmath164 or @xmath42",
    "one can similarly obtain unitaries that are diagonal with respect to the @xmath36 and @xmath37-basis .",
    "for each spin @xmath18 the single qubit transformations @xmath165 with @xmath16 can clearly be implemented by this method .",
    "furthermore the controlled phase gate can be implemented using the measurements process for the and function of section  [ simple ] if we neglect a physically irrelevant global phase factor . with @xmath166",
    "the controlled phase gate is equivalent to a controlled - not by single qubit hadamard transformation .",
    "this shows that the set of gates that can be obtained is universal for quantum computation .",
    "if one uses functions @xmath99 with @xmath167 the process explained above implements a phase shift controlled by the states of all qubits .",
    "note that the results can in principle be generalized to the case that @xmath24 have non - equidistant spectrum .",
    "first we find a suitable rational approximation for the eigenvalues and calculate the least common multiple of the denominators . by rescaling the time by this factor the spectrum can be viewed as a subset of the integers and",
    "the algorithm above can be applied .",
    "the measurement and control schemes presented above are not efficient at all for controlling and measuring a large number @xmath0 of qubits since even the computation of simple functions as the monomials @xmath92 above requires a number of operations that is linear in @xmath91 and exponential in @xmath0 in the case that @xmath45 has equidistant eigenvalues .",
    "now we present a model that is only a slight modification with respect to its physical assumptions but changes the computational model significantly : we assume that the controlling electron can be moved and put at different positions ( see fig .",
    "since the coupling strength @xmath20 between nucleus @xmath18 and electron depends on the distance @xmath19 between them , the interactions strength is no longer fixed .",
    "note that the silicon - based quantum computer proposed by kane @xcite also uses the spins of mobile electrons to control nuclear spins .",
    "however , this analogy should not be taken to literally since the kane - proposal does not control several nuclei by the same electron simultaneously .    for a specific position of the electron",
    ", we define the `` coupling vector '' by @xmath168 where @xmath20 is the strength of the coupling to spin @xmath18 .",
    "now we chose @xmath0 different points @xmath169 as possible positions of the electron . in the generic case",
    ", we will have that the corresponding coupling vectors @xmath170 are linearly independent .",
    "then we can achieve an arbitrary effective coupling vector @xmath171 as follows : if @xmath172 we put the electron for the time @xmath173 at position @xmath18 and before and after this time interval we implement the transformation @xmath174 on the controller spin if and only if @xmath19 is negative .",
    "this reverses the sign of the coupling .",
    "this scheme allows to implement usual two - qubit gates efficiently : set for instance @xmath175 with the values @xmath145 and @xmath67 at arbitrary positions @xmath176 .",
    "this allows to measure every boolean function of these two qubits efficiently or to implement arbitrary two qubit gates",
    ".    it may also be reasonable to choose @xmath177 in order to control three qubits at once , since the control schemes above are not too complex for @xmath178 . in order to compute any function of the hamming weight of the binary word in the register",
    "we choose the effective coupling @xmath179 . using the results of sections  [ group ] and [ simple ]",
    "we can therefore implement all few qubit operations efficiently .",
    "to compare the computational power of our model to the common model with single and two qubit gates as elementary operations we have already mentioned in the last section that all few qubit gates require complexity @xmath180 since the electron has to be put at @xmath0 different positions in the generic case .",
    "conversely , the operation @xmath181 which is elementary in our model ( provided that there is a position such that the coupling vector is @xmath182 ) requires @xmath0 controlled phase shift gates each acting on one of the nuclear spins and the electron spin . note that we do not consider the transformations that can be implemented if one uses the full interaction @xmath183 . to investigate the computational power of this interaction",
    "may be an interesting but difficult task and the simulation of the corresponding time evolution by gate operations is non - trivial .",
    "in principle @xmath0 spins can be controlled by acting on a single control - spin only provided that an appropriate fixed interaction between controller and the @xmath0 spins is given .",
    "measurements and unitary transformations on the @xmath0-qubit register can be implemented . for large @xmath0 , this method becomes rather inefficient . however , there are still some interesting joint observables that can be measured efficiently . if all qubits couple with the probe particle via interactions of the same strength , some simple functions of the hamming weight are easy to obtain .",
    "this illustrates in which way certain joint observables can relative directly be measured , even more directly than single qubit observables .",
    "our model shows that single qubit observables are not necessarily the `` straightforward elementary observables '' of a complex system .",
    "of course one may object that also our model relies on single - qubit measurements on the probe particle .",
    "but , if we consider the probe particle as part of the environment and as more directly observable than the system itself , we may maintain our statement that other observables are sometimes more direct than single qubit measurements .",
    "however , the objection rather shows the circularity of the deep and interesting question `` which quantum observables are most directly accessible ? '' ."
