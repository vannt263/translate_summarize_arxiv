    "observations of classical t tauri stars indicate accretion rates @xmath2yr@xmath3 for @xmath4.@xcite .",
    "the torques driving the accretion are probably magnetic , whether exerted on the face of the disk by a magnetized wind @xcite , or across the thickness of the disk by magnetorotational ( mri ) turbulence ( @xcite ) . at the low temperatures characteristic of most of the mass of a protostellar disk",
    ", the ionization fraction would be too low for good coupling to a magnetic field were it not for nonthermal ionization processes such as cosmic rays , x - rays , and radioactivity . since the sources of the first two lie outside the disk , the surface layers of the disk are expected to be more strongly ionized than the midplane .",
    "it is possible that accretion occurs mainly in the surface layers , while the rest of the disk column forms a magnetically decoupled `` dead zone '' in which mass may accumulate @xcite .",
    "dead zones may be favorable environments for the formation of planets , or for the survival of planets once formed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been recognized at least since gammie s work that small dust grains , through their influence on the ionization balance , are crucial for mri turbulence and for magnetic coupling more generally .",
    "a number of authors have investigated the thickness of the active layer based on different disk models , ionization sources , chemical reaction networks , and grain properties . @xcite and @xcite pointed out the importance of stellar x - rays to the active layer .",
    "@xcite considered the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn , @xcite ) with a chemical network including dust grains and found dead zones extending to @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite showed that the conductivity is sensitive to the abundance of `` metals '' ( mg , fe , etc . ) in the gas phase , eliminating the dead zone entirely from some of their grain - free models , which were @xmath6  disks with lower column density than the mmsn .",
    "@xcite adopted the `` fiducial '' @xmath6  disk model by @xcite , which also has lower surface density at @xmath1 than the mmsn , and a chemical network based on the umist  95 database @xcite supplemented by reactions on grain surfaces from @xcite ; they found a marginally dead zone somewhat smaller than that of @xcite .",
    "more recently , in a similar study based on an @xmath6-disk model and a yet more extensive network , @xcite concluded that adding sub - micron sized grains with concentration of @xmath7 per @xmath8 molecule efficiently depletes metal atoms and dramatically reduces the extent of the active layer .",
    "dust grains in protostellar disks have observable signatures in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from infrared to millimeter wavebands .",
    "small grains in particular near the disk surface are superheated by absorbtion of visible light from the star ; this promotes flaring ( concavity ) of the disk surface and may contribute to the relatively slow decline of the sed with increasing wavelength @xcite .",
    "more refined models , however , show that the dust size distribution may not be well constrained solely from seds @xcite .",
    "@xcite further studied comprehensively the effect of grain growth and settling on the sed of the protoplanetary disks ; comparing their theoretical sed with recent mid- and near - ir observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they found that grains in the disk upper layer should be depleted by at least a factor of 10 relative to interstellar dust - to - gas ratios , and perhaps by @xmath9 .",
    "little attention has been given to the implications of the conductivity constraints for the emissions by the dust and gas .",
    "this is the focus of the present paper .",
    "we recalculate , in yet greater detail , the influence of grains on the ionization balance . in view of the ambiguities in measuring small grains from the seds and",
    "the difficulty of improving on previous work on that problem , however , we chose to concentrate on an indirect signature of dust depletion : enhanced molecular emission from the active layer .",
    "the fundamental co emission line has been frequently observed in cttss , with the likely origin of the protostellar disks within 1 - 2 au ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , discoveries of organic and water molecules have been reported , and these molecules are likely to originate from the inner region ( @xmath10 ) of young protostellar disks @xcite .",
    "these molecular emissions are consistent with hot , optically thin gas . based on the derived temperature and column density",
    ", the emission lines may originate from a uv - heated layer above the disk surface .",
    "however , we argue from the conductivity constraints that dust must be sufficiently depleted from the active layer so that it is at least marginally optically thin , allowing molecular emission lines to stand out .",
    "if the dust size distribution extends to grains as small as @xmath11 , then the heat of accretion may be expressed primarily in these lines rather than in the dust continuum .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : magnetic ] , we review constraints on the minimum ionization fraction and magnetic field strength required to drive accretion at observed rates by winds or by mri turbulence . in   3 - 4 , we calculate the thickness of the active layer .",
    "this is an extension of the work by in06a , with the following differences and additions .",
    "firstly , we use the mmsn for the density and temperature profile of the disk , rather than an @xmath6 model . the mmsn is simply defined and has been used extensively as a standard model for discussion of protostellar disks and planet formation .",
    "it has an empirical basis in the observed properties of our own solar system and is not inconsistent with inferences of t  tauri disks by , e.g. , submillimeter emission .",
    "steady @xmath6 disks are have a weaker observational basis .",
    "they come in many forms , depending on assumptions about accretion and cooling , and they are often not self - consistent where active layers exist .",
    "the particular @xmath6 model used by in06a is convex rather than flared like the mmsn .",
    "secondly , we adopt the latest version of the umist database @xcite for the chemical reactions .",
    "changes in the reaction rates have perceptible consequences for the ionization fraction .",
    "thirdly , we provide more detailed analysis of the dependence of conductivity on the grain properties , especially their size distribution . in  5 , we discuss the conditions under which molecular lines in the active layer of protostellar disks may stand out above the dust continuum . for illustrative purposes , we study the water molecule only ; it is abundant , and its rich spectrum makes it a good coolant . using the emission line and energy level list given by @xcite ( hereafter bt ) , we calculate the molecular line emissions from an isothermal slab in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) to mimic the disk active layer .",
    "various line broadening effects are considered in our calculation .",
    "we derive the conditions on the dust abundance and size distribution in which water lines dominate the cooling of the layer",
    ". limitations of our study and some open questions are discussed in  6 , and a summary is given in  7 .",
    "in this section , we discuss theoretical constraints on the ionization fraction ( @xmath12 ) , magnetic field strength ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) , and surface mass density ( @xmath15 ) of the active layer required to explain magnetically driven accretion rates of order @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "first we consider a magnetized wind , and then mri turbulence . in the latter case",
    ", we emphasize the conditions needed to sustain accretion at the above rate , which are more stringent than those required for linear instability .",
    "the minimal field strength ( @xmath18 ) is about one order of magnitude larger for mri turbulence than for wind - driven accretion at the same @xmath19 .",
    "but the degree of ionization is similar .",
    "we adopt the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) model with stellar mass @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the disk is vertically isothermal with radial temperature profile @xmath21 surface mass density @xmath22 sound speed @xmath23 volume density @xmath24 and scale height @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the disk radius measured in astronomical units and @xmath27 .",
    "note that the disk flares , that is , @xmath28 increases with @xmath29 .",
    "when accretion is wind - driven , angular momentum is extracted via the mean magnetic torque per unit area @xmath30 exerted on the surface the disk .",
    "this must balance the rate of loss of angular momentum per unit area , which is @xmath31 when one considers that the accretion is divided between the two faces of the disk so that @xmath32 we consider @xmath33 for inflow , and hereafter we omit the overbars and absolute value signs where this will not cause confusion .",
    "it is also required that @xmath34 in order that the wind be centrifugally propelled @xcite .",
    "minimizing the total magnetic energy subject to these constraints leads to a minimum total field at the surface of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath35 in this configuration , @xmath36 ; some wind models require @xmath37 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and therefore a stronger total field for the same @xmath19 .",
    "the active layer has thickness @xmath38 , where the dimensionless factor @xmath39 is such that the volume density at the base of the active layer is @xmath40 .",
    "since the vertical density profile under isothermal conditions is gaussian with scale height @xmath41 , @xmath39 depends logarithmically on @xmath42 ; for example , if @xmath43 , then the appropriate value of @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the roughness of our estimates hardly justifies keeping track of this logarithmic dependence , so we simply take @xmath46 at all radii hereafter .    in the configuration that achieves the minimum ( [ eq : windfield ] ) , the total horizontal component",
    "@xmath47 is approximately equal to @xmath48 at the disk surface .",
    "but in the dead zone , @xmath49 because the field there is poorly coupled to the gas and straightens out under magnetic tension .",
    "thus in the active layer , @xmath50 , so that there will be a horizontal electric current in the active layer and an associated electric field . as described in the review by @xcite , the current and the electric field are not in the same direction under the likely conditions prevailing in active layers ; the conductivity is nontrivially tensorial because of the field itself , and because some charged species are more firmly attached to the field than others .",
    "this is quantified by the hall parameters @xmath51 for each charged species @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath54 is the timescale on which particles of species @xmath52 lose their momentum in collisions with the neutrals .",
    "the reduced mass @xmath55 is essentially @xmath56 for free electrons , and @xmath57 for metallic or molecular ions as well as for charged grains , since all of these are heavier than molecular hydrogen .",
    "wardle gives numerical scalings for free electrons and ions , which we rewrite in terms of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the standard properties of the mmsn as @xmath60 charged grains are unmagnetized , @xmath61 . for magnetic fields comparable to the value ( [ eq : windfield ] ) , the ions follow the neutrals ( because @xmath62 ) but the electrons follow the field ( because @xmath63 ) . in the rest frame of the neutrals ,",
    "the current density @xmath64 is therefore borne almost entirely by the electrons , as is the lorentz force @xmath65 .",
    "so there must be an electric field @xmath66 in this frame to prevent the electrons from accelerating , since collisions are ineffective .",
    "thus `` ohm s law '' in the frame of the neutrals becomes @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a unit vector and @xmath69 is the hall conductivity .",
    "the electric field component parallel to @xmath70 is much smaller than the perpendicular component because the ordinary ohmic conductivity @xmath71 is much larger than @xmath72 .",
    "the electric field in the inertial reference frame of the star , where the neutrals have velocity @xmath73 , is @xmath74 .",
    "the azimuthal component @xmath75 must vanish , at least on average , provided that there is no secular increase in the magnetic flux threading the disk . substituting @xmath76 into @xmath77 , and presuming that @xmath78 within the active layer ( though not within the wind ) , we find that the steady - state accretion velocity in the layer is related to the the electron density by @xmath79 on the other hand , local angular momentum conservation requires @xmath80 eliminating @xmath81 and @xmath82 between these two expressions leads to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the density of hydrogen nuclei , so that @xmath85 at cosmic abundance",
    ". taking @xmath86 , as is true for the minimal configuration ( [ eq : windfield ] ) , we have @xmath87 which is independent of @xmath88 .",
    "note that @xmath89 in order that @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xeb ] ) .",
    "strictly steady wind - driven accretion in the extreme hall limit ( @xmath91 ) appears to be a degenerate case .",
    "it may be that the active layer for wind - driven accretion must be in the ambipolar ( @xmath92 ) regime , as in the models of @xcite . still , the electron fraction  ( [ eq : xem ] ) is interesting as a characteristic value",
    ".    a lower bound on @xmath88 can be obtained by considering that the gas pressure at the base of the layer can be no smaller than the change in magnetic pressure across the layer .",
    "the former is @xmath93 , unless the field is strong enough to significantly compress the layer ( which is actually a requirement of the models of @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is @xmath94 , which becomes @xmath95 in the minimum - energy magnetic configuration ( [ eq : windfield ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath96 this is well into the ambipolar regime , because the ion hall parameter @xmath97 for @xmath98 if the minimal field ( [ eq : windfield ] ) is used for @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : betas ] ) .",
    "accretion may be driven by radial transport of angular momentum within the disk or active layer rather than the torques exerted by a wind .",
    "we assume that the transport is due to turbulence excited by the magnetorotational instability ( hereafter mri ) . in a statistical steady state ,",
    "the constancy of the angular momentum of the disk within radius @xmath29 requires @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the torque exerted on the inner edge of the disk ; at radii @xmath101 , it is probably safe to neglect this torque compared to the larger terms on the left hand side above .",
    "the two terms in the integrand are the relevant components of the reynolds and maxwell stresses for angular - momentum transport , with @xmath102 being the mass - weighted velocity fluctuation associated with the turbulence , @xmath103 so that @xmath104 .",
    "linear analysis and nonlinear simulations indicate that the reynolds stress in mri turbulence has the same sign as the maxwell stress but is smaller by a factor @xmath105 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , so for the purposes of the estimates below , the reynolds stress will be neglected , and the maxwell stress will be assumed to be confined to active layers each of column density @xmath88 and thickness @xmath106 on either side of the disk midplane .    with these approximations ,",
    "the average maxwell stress within the active layers becomes @xmath107 since @xmath108 , a lower bound for the root - mean - square total magnetic field in the active layers is @xmath109 in which we have taken the thickness of the layer to be @xmath110 as before . at this field strength ,",
    "the magnetic pressure within the layer is comparable to the gas pressure : @xmath111 the ratio ( [ eq : beta ] ) is often denoted by @xmath112 in the mri literature but is not to be confused with the hall parameters (  [ subsec : wind ] ) .",
    "the linear analysis of wardle ( 1999 ) and the nonlinear simulations of @xcite indicate that mri may grow in stronger fields and produce stronger turbulence with the hall terms than without them , at least for the favorable sign of @xmath113 .",
    "however , it is generally presumed that neither linear mri nor mri - driven turbulence can operate unless @xmath114 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so eq .  (",
    "[ eq : beta ] ) suggests that @xmath115 if mri dominates the accretion process .",
    "the ratio of the minimum fields ( [ eq : bminmri ] ) and ( [ eq : windfield ] ) is @xmath116 , because the turbulent stress is exerted over an area proportional to the thickness of the active layer , whereas the wind stress is exerted on the ( much larger ) horizontal surfaces of these layers .",
    "inserting the lower limit ( [ eq : bminmri ] ) into the expressions ( [ eq : betas ] ) for the hall parameters yields @xmath117 , so the ions may be marginally magnetized . for @xmath97",
    ", the slippage between the neutrals and the field lines is further enhanced by ambipolar diffusion , which scales @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat complicated to discuss if the abundance of negatively charged grains is comparable to that of free electrons . in view of the discussion of magnetic and gas pressures above , however , we expect that @xmath119 will remain less than unity  though not by much  at the radii and accretion rates of interest to us , so that the hall diffusivity is still marginally dominant , @xmath120 .",
    "( a more accurate treatment would likely lead to larger lower bounds on @xmath12 . )",
    "a dimensionless measure of the coupling between the neutrals and the magnetic field within the active layer is the magnetic `` reynolds number '' based on this hall diffusivity , @xmath121 ; like @xcite , we presume that @xmath122 is necessary for sustained turbulence . in that case ,",
    "@xmath123 , and therefore @xmath124    as noted above , the ratio of ohmic to hall conductivities is @xmath125 when @xmath63 and @xmath126 . at the lower bound ( [ eq : bminmri ] ) for the field strength , @xmath127 .",
    "it follows that the magnetic reynolds number ( [ eq : rem ] ) based on the ohmic diffusivity should satisfy @xmath128 in order to support mri - driven accretion at rates @xmath129 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that a criterion based on the elsasser number , @xmath130 , accurately traces the edge of the mri turbulence in their simulations .",
    "( but the former authors referred to this quantity as  magnetic reynolds number \" . )",
    "the elsasser number depends explicitly upon magnetic field as well as @xmath12 .",
    "using @xmath131 to define @xmath88 would impede comparison with most previous studies of the ionization balance  in particular , @xcite  which have adopted thresholds in @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , however , linear stability depends upon at least two dimensionless parameters : @xmath133 , or equivalently @xmath134 since @xmath135 the criterion @xmath136 for the active layer is more conservative ( i.e. , allows a larger active layer ) when @xmath137 , which is the case in almost all published mri simulations because it is desired that the fastest - growing vertical wavelength be smaller than the gas scale height @xmath41 .",
    "for example @xmath138 in @xcite , where @xmath139 is the adopted adiabatic index .",
    "moreover , this criterion is consistent with @xcite s result ( see fig",
    ". 6 of their paper ) .",
    "a strong  but not too strong  vertical field may permit linear growth at @xmath140 .",
    "@xcite found instability up to @xmath141 in their `` quasi - global '' analysis of a vertically stratified shearing box , although their analysis was limited to ideal mhd .",
    "the nonlinear development of mri with equipartition - strength background fields has not been well explored , but it is conceivable that radial advection of flux somehow prefers such states .      for @xmath142 ,",
    "wind - driven and mri - driven accretion require similar ionization fractions , @xmath143 , as shown by equations ( [ eq : xem ] ) and ( [ eq : xermh ] ) .",
    "winds may allow weaker fields than turbulence for the same accretion rate [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : windfield ] ) vs. ( [ eq : bminmri ] ) ] because of a geometric advantage : wind torques are exerted on the disk surface , which has a larger area than the disk thickness by @xmath144 .",
    "however , winds have their own theoretical difficulties @xcite , and the field may have to be much stronger than the minimal value ( [ eq : windfield ] ) .",
    "the constraint that the field not exceed equipartition allows winds to couple to a smaller surface density than turbulence [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_min_wind ] ) & ( [ eq : beta ] ) ] .",
    "we emphasize that the constraints on field strength , active surface density , and ionization fraction discussed in  [ subsec : mri ] are based on accretion rates in the nonlinear regime rather than the minimal conditions for linear mri instability , which are more easily satisfied .",
    "in this section we describe our model for the disk conductivity , including sources of ionization , chemical reaction rates , and grain interactions .",
    "readers interested only in the results may wish to skip ahead to  [ sec : ionresults ] .",
    "our criterion for the active layer is @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the magnetic reynolds number , and @xmath147 is the magnetic diffusivity based on the ohmic conductivity @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "the discussion of  [ sec : magnetic ] indicates that the use of the single dimensionless parameter ( [ eq : rem ] ) is an oversimplification  the hall parameters ( [ eq : betas ] ) , which involve the field strength , are also important  but the criterion @xmath145 appears to be necessary if not sufficient near @xmath1 , at least if mri turbulence dominates the transport of angular momentum .      a number of nonthermal processes may contribute to an excess of free electrons over the abundance in lte .",

    "the results above can be qualitatively understood .",
    "the cross sections of all grain reactions scale with grain surface area , but they are modulated by a grain - polarization term that enhances the cross section of smaller grains . for the reaction @xmath260 , the collision rate per grain is proportional to @xcite @xmath261 and for @xmath262 , the reaction rate is roughly proportional to @xmath263 although smaller grains also have smaller sticking coefficients for electrons , we find through numerical experiments that over a wide temperature range , the electron sticking coefficient for an @xmath264 neutral grain is greater than that for an @xmath265 neutral grain by a factor only @xmath266 .",
    "therefore , the electron abundance is roughly controlled by the total surface area of the dust grains , but smaller grains lead to smaller @xmath12 at fixed total surface area .",
    "our simple analysis here considers just the direct electron absorption by dust grains , which roughly applies to the simple network . for the complex network , however , much more complicated interactions between dust and all the species , as well as the complex reactions in the gas phase make it less predictive .",

    "however , figures [ fig : sig1 ] , [ fig:7 ] , & [ fig:8 ] do suggest that at gas densities relevant to the base of the active layer ( @xmath418 ) , it is roughly the case that @xmath12 varies with @xmath419 and @xmath254 in the combination @xmath420 with an exponent @xmath421 somewhere between @xmath422 and @xmath423 , where @xmath424 is the differential mass fraction of grains with size @xmath254 .",

    "also shown in figure  [ fig : constraints ] are the loci at which an active layer of surface density @xmath432 would be marginally optically thick to to dust , and the much lower loci at which the emissivities of the layer due to @xmath433 and dust would be comparable . the dust opacities were derived from the thermally - averaged optical efficiency factors computed by @xcite ; we assumed a mixture of 58% silicate and 42% graphite grains by mass .",
    "the figure shows that the absorption opacity depends mainly on dust mass fraction provided @xmath434 , because emission and absorption then occur mainly in the dipole regime .",
    "the @xmath412 curves are also rather insensitive to the temperature , at least over the range we consider ( @xmath435 ) .",
    "the equal - emissivity curves are more sensitive , however , because of the temperature dependence of the molecular emissivity seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : slabs ] .",
    "the main conclusion that we draw from figure  [ fig : constraints ] is that the active layer should be optically thin to dust .",
    "therefore molecular emission lines should stand out above the dust continuum if the layer is heated by dissipation of mri turbulence .",
    "the detectability of the lines will be reduced by the doppler broadening associated with the orbital motion of the gas , which is much larger than thermal and collisional broadening , unless the disk is observed face on or spatially resolved ( e.g. with an interferometer ) .",

    "it seems even to require that cooling of the active layer is dominated by molecules rather than dust , unless grains smaller than @xmath440 are essentially completely excluded .",
    "the preceding sections have shown that our understanding of the interplay among grains , magnetic fields , and thermal emissions in protostellar disks suffers from many uncertainties .",
    "some of these uncertainties might be reduced in the foreseeable future by further research .",
    "others seem likely to plague astronomers for quite some time .",
    "our criterion of the active zone is based on the choice of the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath441 . as discussed in  [ sec : magnetic ] , our estimate may be conservative , and our calculation may provide the upper limit of the size of the active zone .    we have adopted the minimum - mass solar nebular disk model .",
    "this model is idealized in two aspects .",
    "it has an empirical surface density profile designed to match the mass distribution in the solar system . in the mmsn ,",
    "the mass density scales linearly with the surface density coefficient @xmath442 , but the disk scale height is independent of @xmath442 , and therefore so is the flux of x - rays and cosmic - rays impinging on the disk .",
    "in fact , we have experimented with different @xmath442 , and found that @xmath15 is essentially independent of @xmath442 , although at higher surface density , the active layer of the disk resides at higher altitude .",
    "the mmsn is also assumed to be vertically isothermal . in reality , in the presence of small grains , the surface layers should be warmer than the midplane even in a disk passively heated by stellar irradiation @xcite , and warmer still if turbulent accretion is concentrated in active layers .",
    "higher temperature reduces the recombination rate and thereby increases the electron abundance , but only weakly ( @xmath443 , see  [ sssec : g0chem ] ) . therefore , we expect that the size of the active zone is not affected much by the disk temperature profile . molecular emission , however , could be strongly affected (  [ sec : cooling ] ) .",
    "major uncertainties attend the ionization model .",
    "the ionization rate is proportional to the x - ray luminosity and also depends on the x - ray temperature of the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "a stellar wind may shield cosmic rays from the disk . in the outer disk ,",
    "x - ray ionization is inefficient when small dust grains are present , and the ionization rate critically depends on cosmic rays .",
    "these effects are well studied in this paper .",
    "a related uncertainty comes from metal abundances .",
    "metal atoms are effective electron donors . in the absence of grains ,",
    "the electron abundance is directly correlated with metal abundance .",
    "since our results show that grains must be severely suppressed in order for a reasonable amount of the disk to be active , under such conditions , metals may be important .",
    "our standard parameter assumes a relatively high metal abundance ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "our results also suggest that the abundance is unlikely to be much lower than this , since an even more severe constraint on the dust abundance would then be required . moreover , in the outer disk where the disk temperature is low , essentially all the metals are adsorbed onto dust grains .",
    "unless cosmic - rays can provide the ionization , the outer disk is unlikely to be very active .",
    "grain properties are another major source of uncertainty , as studied in detail in this paper .",
    "we devote the next subsection discussing the grain size distribution . here , we emphasize that the simple and complex reaction networks show different response to grain abundance .",
    "namely , in the complete absence of grains , or at the full ism dust - to - mass ratio ( @xmath232 ) , the complex network produces more free electrons .",
    "however , for intermediate dust abundances , the simple network gives a larger @xmath12 , sometimes even 10 times larger .",
    "the oppenheimer & dalgarno model , though popular for its simplicity ( eg.@xcite ) , should therefore be used with caution when grains are assumed .      the basic theme of this paper is to compare constraints on the grain abundance from the requirement of adequate magnetic coupling to those provided by infrared observations of thermal disk emission . for a given total mass @xmath255 in grains per unit mass of gas , however , these two constraints depend differently on the sizes of grains , to the point that no useful comparison can be made if the size distribution is regarded as a completely free function . thus , it is important to consider what constraints are available for this distribution . to bound the discussion ,",
    "we take the distribution to be a truncated power law similar to the standard mrn form ( [ eq : mrn ] ) but possibly with different lower and upper cutoffs ( @xmath427 and @xmath409 ) and with a different exponent @xmath421 , i.e. @xmath444 .    collisional cascades involving macroscopic bodies such as asteroids or kuijper - belt objects result in powerlaws with @xmath445 when the cohesive strength is independent of size ; the slope becomes steeper ( i.e. larger @xmath421 ) if large bodies are weaker than small ones , and shallower in the opposite case ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in line with this , @xcite have proposed that the msn distribution results from collisions between grains overrun by shocks . in their model , the grains are taken to have strengths similar to those terrestrial rocks and minerals , so that the minimum relative velocity between grains required for fragmentation is @xmath446 .",
    "this is much larger than the likely collisional velocities of submicron grains in protostellar disks .",
    "many authors have considered the collisional agglomeration of grains in protostellar disks . in a recent study , @xcite",
    "demonstrate that if the sticking probability is taken to be high and fragmentation is ignored , then almost all grains smaller than @xmath447 would disappear in less than @xmath448 , causing the disks to become optically thin .",
    "as they note , this contradicts the observation that many or most t  tauri disks remain optically thick , as judged by their spectral energy distributions at @xmath449 , to ages of at least @xmath450 ; the suggestion is that small grains must be replenished by fragmentation processes .",
    "in a recent review , @xcite discuss the observational evidence for grain growth and grain processing in protostellar disks .",
    "millimeter observations indicate the presence of millimeter or even centimeter - sized grains in many disks .",
    "on the other hand , infrared silicate features  especially crystalline features near @xmath247point to the persistence of micron or submicron - sized grains even in the oldest disks .",
    "pah features are also sometimes seen .",
    "but there is no clear evolutionary trend in the grain size distribution with disk ( or rather stellar ) age , which points again to active replenishment of the small - grain population .",
    "we have calculated the free - electron abundance and conductivity as a function of local parameters : density , temperature , grain abundance , and ionization rate , etc .",
    "since x - rays and cosmic rays penetrate only a limited column , the resulting electron abundance has a large vertical gradient . any turbulent diffusion would mix electrons and ions vertically .",
    "the consequences for the width of the active layer depend upon the ratio of the timescales for mixing and recombination .",
    "if accretion is driven by turbulence and the turbulent transport coefficient for mass is comparable to that for momentum ( i.e. to the turbulent viscosity ) , then absent dust grains , the diffusion may be faster than recombination ; as a result , the dead zone may be reduced or even eliminated @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed 3d mhd simulations of protostellar disks with vertical structure , ohmic resistivity , and time - dependent chemical evolution based on the simple ( oppenheimer - dalgarno ) reaction network without grains , allowing the reactants to be passively advected .",
    "turbulent mixing led to a weak coupling of the dead zone to the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite found in similar simulations that the effect of turbulent mixing critically depend on gas - phase metal abundance .",
    "@xcite included a uniform mass fraction of @xmath451 dust grains . despite rapid recombination on grain surfaces , the radial magnetic field generated in the active layer diffused toward the disk mid - plane , causing some accretion there and rendering it  undead \" .",
    "the simulations cited above adopted microphysical parameters very favorable to mri . for example , in the absence of grains , as in @xcite and @xcite , atomic metal ions recombine only by radiative processes , which are slow compared to the dissociative recombination of molecular ions .",
    "the 1@xmath452 grains adopted in @xcite affect the electron abundance much less than smaller grains , as we have seen .",
    "@xcite chose a rather high protostellar x - ray luminosity ( @xmath453 ) and temperature ( @xmath454 ) .",
    "while all of these simulations would be described as `` vertically stratified '' in the parlance of mri shearing - box work because they included vertical gravitational accelerations , buoyancy forces were excluded by the use of isothermal equations of state .",
    "true stratification , as expected in real disks , may inhibit vertical mixing .",
    "most importantly , the relevant component of the turbulent stress , @xmath455 , was found to be at best constant with height .",
    "since , in steady state accretion , the accretion rate is proportional to the areal integral of this stress [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : jcons ] ) ] , the `` undead '' zones contribute to @xmath19 only in proportion to their geometrical thickness , which is comparable to that of the active layers , rather than in proportion to their mass column .",
    "we have studied constraints on small dust grains in protostellar disks posed by the requirement that the electrical conductivity be sufficient to support magnetically driven accretion at observed rates .",
    "we have considered the implications of these constraints for the production of molecular emission lines , especially at radii @xmath456 where accretion is likely to to be confined near the surfaces of the disk in `` active '' layers comprising a fraction of the total column density .",
    "we adopt the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) and assume protostellar x - rays and interstellar cosmic - rays to be the main sources of ionization .",
    "we compare a simple chemical reaction modeled on @xcite with a complex reaction network extracted from the latest umist database @xcite .",
    "reactions involving dust grains are modeled according to the general scheme laid out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter in06a ) , with some improvements , including the use of up to two grain sizes in order to mimic an mrn grain size distribution .",
    "the conductivity is heavily dominated by the smaller grains .",
    "we discuss in detail the dependence of free electron abundance ( @xmath12 ) on density , temperature , ionization rate , gas - phase metal abundance , and especially on grain size and grain abundance .",
    "separately , we estimate that electron fractions @xmath457 are required at @xmath1 to explain accretion at @xmath458 , which is typical of the more active systems ; minimum magnetic field strengths range from a few tenths of a gauss if accretion is driven by winds , to several gauss if it is powered by magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "it is difficult to be very precise about these requirements because of the complexities of winds and turbulence in the presence of vertical stratification and tensorial conductivities , but the numbers just given are probably conservative .",
    "we define the active layer as the column density @xmath88 at which @xmath459 , where @xmath460 and @xmath461 is the ohmic diffusivity .",
    "smaller values of @xmath462 are probably not realistic because , at the field strengths we estimate , hall and ambipolar drift contribute to slippage between the neutrals and the field . by this definition ,",
    "it is difficult to achieve @xmath463 at @xmath1 even if the small grains are strongly suppressed .    in more detail ,",
    "our conclusions regarding the conductivity are as follows :    1 .   the free electron abundance @xmath12 depends more strongly on density ( @xmath188 ) and ionization rate ( @xmath179 ) than on temperature .",
    "even a small amount of dust suppresses atomic ions such as @xmath464 and @xmath465 in the gas phase , as found by @xcite ; however , we find that this is due to recombination on grain surfaces rather than adsoprtion , except at temperatures ( @xmath466 for mg ) .",
    "2 .   in the absence of grains ,",
    "the complex chemical reaction network predicts a slightly higher @xmath12 than the simple oppenheimer - dalgarno model , rather than the reverse as in06a found .",
    "this appears to be caused by updates to the reaction rates in the umist database .",
    "these changes are within the typical uncertainties of those rates @xcite .",
    "the electron abundance depends sensitively on grains , but this dependence can not be accurately characterized by a simple combination of grain size and grain abundance , especially in the complex network",
    ". roughly however , the controlling parameter lies somewhere between the total grain surface area , @xmath467 , and the grain abundance weighted by linear size , @xmath468 .",
    "standard cosmic - ray ionization rates @xmath469 render the entire disk column active beyond @xmath173 even in the presence of sub - micron grains .",
    "x - rays contribute to @xmath12 only near the disk surface , within columns @xmath470 .",
    "the effect of x - ray scattering on the ionization rate is small at @xmath1 , but becomes important farther out .",
    "5 .   in the inner disk around @xmath1 ,",
    "rather extreme parameters are required to achieve active layers as large as @xmath471 if submicron grains are present .",
    "for example , if all grains have size @xmath231 , then the dust - to - gas ratio must be reduced to @xmath472 for standard x - ray and cosmic - ray parameters . if @xmath473 were increased to @xmath474well above ism values but perhaps a proxy for nonthermal processes within the disk or stellar corona ",
    "then @xmath475 could be tolerated , still two orders of magnitude below the ism abundance but compatible with some models of the infrared spectral energy distribution @xcite . if the grains extend to @xmath476 with a standard @xmath477 size distribution , then @xmath317 even if the maximum grain size grows to @xmath478 with our standard ionization sources .",
    "the last two points above lead us to suspect that either an important source of ionization has been overlooked , or else something other than mri turbulence drives accretion , at least near @xmath1 .",
    "however , if we suppress these suspicions , then we conclude that the active layer at @xmath1 should be optically thin to dust in the planck average .",
    "just how thin depends upon the minimum grain size , since the dust opacity depends mainly on total dust mass fraction @xmath255 as long as @xmath409 is smaller than a few microns .",
    "we have estimated the emissivity of the active layer due to water lines , taking into account that the important lines are strongly saturated for @xmath479 because collisional broadening is almost negligible at relevant pressures ( @xmath480 ) . for plausible grain properties , the heat dissipated by mri turbulence",
    "may be radiated primarily in molecular lines , and the gas temperature may be significantly higher than the effective temperature because the total emissivity of the active layer due to dust and molecules is small .",
    "this offers the exciting prospect that molecular lines from active layers may be observable , and indeed may already have been observed by @xcite",
    ". however , quantitative diagnoses of active layers using such lines will require theoretical modeling of the coupled dynamical and thermal evolution of the mri turbulence .",

    "we also thank mark wardle , and our referee , neal turner , for stressing the importance of x - ray scattering on disk ionization .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf award phy-0821899 `` center for magnetic self - organization in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . ''",
    "the x - ray ionization rate is a crucial factor on disk conductivity . in our original version of this paper",
    ", we calculated the x - ray using the formula given by equations ( 2)-(4 ) of @xcite , where the x - ray photons was assumed to be attenuated only by absorption .",
