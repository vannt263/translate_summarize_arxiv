    "after a period of harsh criticism , the connection between the microscopic world and the displayed macroscopic properties of the system by means of the boltzmann principle , which was later extended by gibbs to systems in contact with a reservoir , has achieved an incontestable consensus  [ @xcite ] . despite its broad acceptance ,",
    "it is neglected by many people that the standard statistical mechanics is still based on a hypothesis , the _ stosszahl ansatz",
    "_  [ @xcite ] .",
    "this ansatz is intimately related to the ergodic theory which has only been analytically proven for a set of very few simple systems  [ @xcite ] . with the surging interest in more intricate systems for which the ergodic theory is bound to be invalid , _",
    "e.g. _ , systems that occupy their allowed phase space in a scale - invariant way or exhibit long spatiotemporal correlations  [ @xcite ] , entropic forms different to the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) functional have been presented . among several , two of them",
    "might be given special emphasis : the renyi entropy  [ @xcite ] and the non - additive entropy proposed in a physical context by tsallis  [ @xcite ] .",
    "for the last two decades there has been an impressive amount of work towards the physical validation and application of the latter  [ @xcite ] . as occurs in the bg standard case  [ @xcite ] , many systems studied within the non - additive formalism present a reduced number of observations or correspond to finite size systems  [ @xcite ] .",
    "consequently , a considerable error can be introduced if the simplest method based on binning the data is assumed and the number of observables is very small .    in this manuscript",
    "we generalise a well - known binless strategy for the estimation of bg entropy , the kozachenko - leonenko algorithm ( kla )  [ @xcite ] , which bases the estimation of the theoretical entropy on the distance @xmath0 to the nearest - neighbour of a specific order @xmath1 .",
    "we illustrate its possible validity by comparing numerical results with the theoretical values in two different situations : independent and dependent variables . in the former ,",
    "we survey three standard distributions ( pdf ) , namely the gaussian , the student-@xmath2 ( or @xmath3-gaussian ) and the uniform pdf . in the latter case",
    ", we analyse linear and non - linear dependent student-@xmath2 variables . for the sake of simplicity , we will restrict our analysis to one - dimensional systems corresponding to sets of random variables .",
    "the non - additive entropy is defined as  [ @xcite],@xmath4   ^{q}\\,dx}% { q-1},\\qquad\\left (   q\\in\\mathbb{r}\\right )   \\label{s - q}%\\ ] ] which in the limit @xmath5 going to @xmath6 concurs with the boltzmann - gibbs entropy , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents the average .",
    "bearing in mind the @xmath5-logarithm definition @xcite , @xmath9 , it is easily verifiable that the entropic functional can be written in the following way,@xmath10 with @xmath11 . in other words ,",

    "in this manuscript we have introduced a generalisation of the well - known binless lozachenko - leonenko entropy estimator to appraise the ( tsallis ) non - additive entropy in systems with a small number of observations for which binning strategies are likely to present strong deviation from the expected theoretical result . by comparing numerical results with theoretical values",
    "we have verified that the kla approach is not effective .",
