    "in 2005 , cohen and moerner introduced the anti - brownian electrokinetic ( abel ) trap , a new experimental technique for studying long - time dynamical properties of small particles and molecules .",
    "one key advantage over other trapping techniques such as optical or magnetic tweezers is its ability to trap molecules and sub - micron particles directly rather than via the micron - sized particles of the former techniques .",
    "the abel trap uses feedback to counteract the random thermal fluctuations that perturb the motion of small objects in a finite - temperature fluid @xcite , with electrokinetic forces being one way among many to apply restoring forces ; it is thus perhaps more simply termed a _",
    "feedback trap_. the basic idea is to observe the position of an object , compare its estimated position with a desired position , and , as rapidly as possible , apply a corrective force to move the particle towards the desired position . to trap small objects ,",
    "the observations must be rapid , as the particle diffuses  out of control \" during the time @xmath0 between corrections .",
    "indeed , the lower limit to the size of particle that can be trapped depends directly on @xmath0 .",
    "recently , fields and cohen , by responding to every detected photon , were able to trap for several seconds a single fluorescent dye molecule diffusing in water @xcite .",
    "cohen has also shown that a feedback trap can do more than just trap a particle : it is also possible to place the particle in an arbitrary  virtual \" potential @xcite .",
    "the protocol to approximate motion in a potential @xmath1 works as follows : let the estimated position of the particle at time step @xmath2 , in units of a sampling period @xmath0 , be @xmath3 .",
    "( we distinguish between the observed position @xmath3 and the true position @xmath4 . ) then , at time step @xmath2 , we apply the force @xmath5 , held constant over the interval @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "experimental evidence is given that the probability distribution of observed positions @xmath6 obeys the boltzmann distribution @xmath7 $ ] .    in the above scheme",
    ", the potential imposed is a virtual one that is imposed by the rules of the feedback loop .",
    "take away the feedback loop , and there is only a particle diffusing in a fluid .",
    "but then it is fair to ask , in what sense is the motion of a discrete closed - loop feedback system equivalent to a  real \" potential ?",
    "after all , the dynamics is discretized at a time scale @xmath0 .",
    "reasoning by analogy to computer simulations of the langevin equation , we expect that as @xmath8 , the closed - loop feedback system will be equivalent to the desired continuous dynamical system .",
    "but experiments are always done at finite @xmath0 , and the information is acted upon only after a delay , @xmath9 . in addition , the position is typically measured ( with random error ) by integrating a camera over a finite time @xmath10 that can be comparable to @xmath0 . under such conditions , is the motion truly equivalent to the desired potential ? are there corrections to the  naive potential \" ?",
    "if so , are such corrections important in a given application ? likewise ,",
    "can one use virtual potentials for thermodynamic calculations such as the work done by a changing potential ?",
    "we will find that the answers to these questions are mathematically boring ",
    "the situation resembles that of a continuous system with discrete observations  but",
    "physically exciting : we can now study the motion of a particle in an arbitrary potential or force field and learn about both dynamic and thermodynamic quantities .",
    "indeed , this article was motivated by attempts to use a feedback trap to explore landauer s principle that erasing information in a memory element requires a finite amount of work @xcite . after making preliminary measurements reporting a qualitative observation of the effect @xcite",
    ", we realized that there were systematic deviations from calculations based on a continuous potential that needed to be understood before a quantitative study could be made .",
    "the calculations reported below address these concerns .",
    "in this section , we explore the dynamics of a feedback trap with an imposed quadratic virtual potential",
    ". the goal will be to calculate the power spectrum and variance of the particle s position fluctuations .",
    "the calculation is complicated by the presence of three short time scales , which are comparable but not in general equal :    1 .",
    "the output is updated after an observation with a delay time @xmath9 .",
    "the observation is made via a camera exposure of duration @xmath10 .",

    ", previous work has not described all the consequences of these experimental complications .",
    "below , we will see how to incorporate them by solving a series of increasingly complicated problems :    1 .",

    "[ fig : kchangework](c ) , we see that the skew decreases as @xmath182 for large @xmath158 . to reduce the effect of rare outliers , we use a robust measure of skew , @xmath183/w_{50}$ ] , where @xmath184 is the median value of work and @xmath185 and @xmath186 represent the first and third quartile values @xcite .",
    "skewness thus serves to measure disequilibrium .",
    "an alternative measure  requiring more data to calculate with equivalent precision  is based on the relative entropy between forward and backward processes @xcite .",
    "the origin of the scaling of the skew measure deserves more investigation .",
    "we note that the values for the asymptotic work differ from the  naive \" calculation of @xmath187 by @xmath138 for @xmath68 .",
    "since the work depends on @xmath86 and since this quantity also differs by @xmath138 from the continuous value for small @xmath61 , the observation is expected .",
    "the main point is that there are no secular terms whose error grows with @xmath158 .",
    "rather , no matter how long the measurement , the errors are controlled by the discretization size @xmath61 .",
    "we also note that the work we calculate is greater than that for the corresponding continuous case . in a recent paper ,",
    "sivak et al .  have pointed out that the integration scheme itself injects extra  shadow \" work into the system  @xcite . in principle , integration schemes that are more sophisticated than euler integration could be used to remove the effects of shadow work .",
    "finally , we have explored numerically the effects of a camera exposure @xmath10 and observation noise @xmath115 and find that they have only a small numerical effect ( data not shown ) .",
    "such a result is expected from the results of our calculations of power spectra and variance in section  [ sec : equiv2cont ] , where we saw that @xmath10 and @xmath115 made only minor shifts in those quantities .",
    "in this article , we have shown that the complications brought on by finite time scales in virtual potentials can be accounted for and do not lead to radical differences between virtual and actual potentials , as long as we are careful .",
    "we find that calculations of dynamics  such as variance , power spectrum , and work ",
    "lead to answers that agree with continuum calculations to @xmath138 , where @xmath61 is the ratio of the feedback update time to the relaxation time of the potential .",
    "the situation is then similar to that of ordinary experiments that also discretize continuous signals .",
    "the main practical difference is that experiments with a physical potential can usually sample at very small values of @xmath61 ( e.g. , @xmath188 in @xcite ) , whereas feedback experiments , which must act in real time on each observation , often use higher values ( e.g. , @xmath112 in @xcite ) . as we saw in section",
    "[ sec : harmonic - perfect ] , minimizing the delay helps to increase the value of the instability gain @xmath87 and , by extension , to increase the range of acceptable feedback gains @xmath61 .",
    "although feedback traps use relatively large values of @xmath61 , they can impose more general and better - controlled motion ( via virtual potentials ) on a particle than can be done with physical potentials .",
    "for example , in exploring the landauer principle with the feedback trap , we have been able to implement the scheme proposed by dillenschneider and lutz @xcite , which is based on a specific parametrization of a double - well potential where the difference in well depth and barrier heights are separately controlled .",
    "although such manipulations can be approximately done by placing two optical traps side by side and adding a sideways flow @xcite , more general and better - controlled variations are possible in the feedback trap , since the form of the imposed potential is now arbitrary , as long as the feedback gain is small enough .",
    "one assumption in the work presented above is that the electrokinetic force in an abel trap responds instantaneously to the command signal .",
    "this is usually a good approximation : both electrophoretic and electroosmotic forces depend on a realignment of the double - layer , which is typically much less than a micron in scale .",
    "typical response times are then of order 10 @xmath189s @xcite , which is much faster than the ms time scale of feedback traps . in related work , we have used piezoelectric translation stages to _ track _ the motion of small particles rather than trap them .",
    "the formalism that is required is similar to that explored here , but one must then account for the finite relaxation time , of order ms , of the translation stages  @xcite .    we have also shown that calculations of work done by the virtual potential are relatively straightforward , although many theoretical questions deserve more exploration",
    ". however , the situation is less clear regarding the calculation of heat dissipation into a thermal bath . a naive discretization analogous to that used for work , eq .",
    "gives the correct result when applied to harmonic potentials but has spurious secular terms that grow linearly with the protocol time for anharmonic potentials .",
    "however , we observe similar effects when using the euler discretization to calculate heat dissipation for ordinary langevin equations with anharmonic potentials ( but no feedback ) .",
    "indeed , how to calculate the heat properly from sampled data  with or without feedback  remains an issue of current discussion  @xcite .",
    "one final question is whether experiments can impose conditions and forces that are well - enough controlled to apply the theory described in this work .",
    "that is , we have assumed that the particle moves only because of thermal fluctuations and because of deliberately applied forces . knowing their effects",
    "requires a calibration of both electrical mobility ( the charge on a particle ) and diffusion constant ( the size of a particle ) .",
    "it also assumes that the electric field is known and there are no mechanical drifts . in preliminary experimental work",
    ", we have established that it is possible to accurately describe motions at frequencies above 1 hz , but at lower frequencies , mechanical drifts from temperature variations become important .",

    "this work was supported by nserc ( canada ) .",
