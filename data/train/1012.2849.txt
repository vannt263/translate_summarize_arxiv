    "the cosmological principle is one of the cornerstones of modern cosmology . roughly speaking , the principle states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "although large - scale homogeneity and isotropy were initially postulated , in recent decades the principle has received mounting experimental support , and today there is little doubt about its validity .",
    "the cosmological principle has a slightly preciser formulation , which states that a perturbed friedman - robertson - walker metric provides an accurate description of the universe .",
    "thus , according to the cosmological principle , the universe is well - described by the perturbed spacetime metric @xmath1,\\ ] ] with sufficiently small ( scalar ) perturbations at long wavelengths @xmath2 but apart from that , the principle has nothing to say about the properties of these perturbations .",
    "many of the advances in modern cosmology consist in the characterization of the metric perturbations @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "though not often explicitly emphasized , one of the key assumptions is that these perturbations are just a particular realization of a random process in a statistical ensemble .",
    "hence , we do not really try to describe the actual perturbations @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; our goal is to characterize the statistical properties of the random fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote any random field in the universe , such as the metric perturbations considered above , or the energy density of any of the components of our universe .",
    "the statistical properties of the random field are uniquely specified by its probability distribution functional .",
    "it turns to be simpler however to study the moments of the field @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes ensemble average , and all the fields are evaluated at a common but arbitrary time @xmath0 , which we suppress for simplicity .",
    "the cosmological principle has formal counterparts in the properties of the perturbations , though , as we emphasized above , the cosmological principle itself only requires the actual perturbations in our universe to be small .",
    "we say that a random field @xmath12 is statistically homogeneous ( or stationary ) , if all its moments are invariant under translations , @xmath13 in some cases , statistical homogeneity may apply only to some field moments .",
    "the random field is _ stationary in the mean _ if @xmath14 and it is _ stationary in the variance _ if @xmath15 where we have defined @xmath16 . if the random field is gaussian , the one- and two - point functions uniquely determine all the remaining moments of the field .",
    "a gaussian random field stationary in the mean and in the variance is hence automatically fully stationary .",
    "parallel definitions apply to the properties of the perturbations under rotations . in particular",
    ", we say that a random field @xmath12 is _ isotropic in the mean _",
    "if @xmath17 analogously , a random field is _ isotropic in the variance _ if @xmath18 since there is always a rotation that maps @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and because any two points related by a rotation always differ by a translation , equations ( [ eq : stationary mean ] ) and ( [ eq : isotropic mean ] ) imply that homogeneity and isotropy in the mean are equivalent .",
    "but homogeneity in the variance _ does not _ imply isotropy in the variance , though the converse is true @xcite , @xmath21    homogeneity and isotropy in the mean have an important consequence : equations ( [ eq : stationary mean ] ) or ( [ eq : isotropic mean ] ) immediately imply that the expectation of a stationary field is constant , @xmath22 and , conversely , any random field with constant mean is homogeneous and isotropic in the mean . because , by definition , cosmological perturbations always represent deviations from a homogeneous and isotropic background , it is then always possible to assume that the constant value of their mean is zero , if they happen to be stationary .",
    "for example , in perturbation theory we write the total energy density @xmath23 as a background value @xmath24 plus a perturbation @xmath25 , @xmath26 this split into a background value and a perturbation is essentially ambiguous , unless we specify what the background actually is . in cosmology , what sets the background apart from the perturbations is symmetry . because of the cosmological principle , the background energy density @xmath24 is _ defined _ to be homogeneous . hence , if the constant mean of the stationary random field @xmath25 is not zero , we may redefine our background and perturbations by @xmath27 without affecting the overall value of the energy density , @xmath28 . in this case the redefined perturbation @xmath29 has zero mean , while the redefined background @xmath30 is still space - independent .",
    "it is important to recognize that cosmological perturbations can be assumed to have zero mean if and only if their mean is a constant .",
    "consider again the example of the energy density ( [ eq : split ] ) , but now assume that @xmath25 is not stationary .",
    "although the redefinitions ( [ eq : redefinition ] ) allow us to set the mean of the perturbations @xmath31 to zero , the redefined background @xmath30 is inhomogeneous in this case , in contradiction with our definition of the background density @xmath24 in equation ( [ eq : split ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that homogeneity in the mean , isotropy in the mean and zero mean are all equivalent , @xmath32    homogeneity and isotropy in the variance also have important implications @xcite .",
    "if a random field is stationary in the variance , its two point function in momentum space has to be proportional to a delta function , @xmath33 and if the variance is isotropic , the power spectrum @xmath34 can only depend on the magnitude of @xmath35 , @xmath36    based on the equivalences ( [ eq : equivalencea ] ) and ( [ eq : equivalenceb ] ) , there are hence six possible different combinations of the statistical properties of the primordial perturbations , which we list in table [ tab : cases ] .",
    "hypothesis @xmath37 describes the standard assumption that underlies most analyses of cosmological perturbations , and case @xmath38 describes what is usually known as a violation of statistical isotropy . in this article",
    "we focus on violations of the zero mean hypothesis , cases @xmath39 through @xmath40 . our goal is to test the standard assumption @xmath37 against one of its non - zero mean alternatives .",
    ".the six possible different combinations of statistical properties of the primordial perturbations .",
    "we are concerned here with the mean and variance alone . [",
    "tab : cases ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "at present , the arguably cleanest and widest window on the primordial perturbations in our universe stems from the temperature anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "hence , if we want to test whether cosmological perturbations have zero mean , we need to explore how these temperature anisotropies are related to the random fields that we have considered in the introduction .      in a homogeneous and isotropic universe ,",
    "different fourier modes of cosmological perturbations evolve independently in linear perturbation theory .",
    "hence , we may always assume that the temperature anisotropies ( of primordial origin ) observed at point @xmath19 in the direction @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the fourier components of a random field at a sufficiently early time , and @xmath44 is a transfer function whose explicit form we shall not need .",
    "say , in a standard @xmath45cdm cosmology we have @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the primordial newtonian potential , which , because of the absence of anisotropic stress , also equals @xmath48 . due to the linear relation between temperature anisotropies and primordial perturbations",
    ", it immediately follows that zero mean in the primordial perturbations implies zero mean of the temperature anisotropies .    for many purposes ,",
    "it is more convenient to represent functions on a sphere , like the temperature fluctuations , by their spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath49 throughout this article we work with _ real _ spherical harmonics @xmath50 , whose properties are summarized in appendix a. to calculate the spherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature anisotropies @xmath51 we note that because linear perturbations evolve in an isotropic background ( by definition ) , the transfer function @xmath52 can only depend on the two scalars @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , we may expand the latter in legendre polynomials @xmath55 , @xmath56 with real functions @xmath57 . substituting then equation ( [ eq : legendre expansion ] ) into ( [ eq : t anisotropies ] ) ,",
    "setting @xmath58 , and using the addition theorem for ( real ) spherical harmonics in equation ( [ eq : addition theorem ] ) we get @xmath59 clearly , if primordial perturbations have zero mean , so do the spherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature anisotropies : @xmath60 in particular , a violation of the condition @xmath61 would thus imply a violation of statistical homogeneity .",
    "later we shall also need to know the covariance of the temperature multipoles , which follows from equation ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "if the random field @xmath12 is homogeneous and isotropic in the variance , the covariance matrix of the multipoles has elements @xmath62 recall that for arbitrary @xmath63 we define @xmath64 thus , @xmath65 denotes departures from a homogeneous and isotropic background , whereas @xmath66 denotes deviations from the ensemble mean . in the following ,",
    "we drop the hat from random variables and fields .      unfortunately , the temperature anisotropies we actually observe in the sky are not entirely of primordial origin .",
    "they are a superposition of primordial anisotropies @xmath67 and foreground contributions , such as dust emission and synchrotron radiation from our very own galaxy .",
    "appropriate foreground templates allow the wmap team to eliminate foregrounds in some regions of the sky @xcite , but the cleaning procedure does not completely remove foreground contamination along the galactic disc .",
    "it is thus necessary to subject these maps to additional processing .",
    "since the actual temperature measurements involve a convolution with the detector beam @xmath68 , and also include detector noise @xmath69 , we model the temperature anisotropies in a smoothed , foreground - reduced map by @xmath70,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the smoothing kernel , the star denotes convolution , and @xmath72 represents the residual foreground contamination .",
    "we assume that the smoothing kernel and the detector beam are rotationally symmetric .",
    "this is actually not the case for the wmap beam , but it should be a good approximation at the scales we are going to consider . in that case , in harmonic space , the convolution acts on the spherical harmonic coefficients simply by multiplication , say , @xmath73    in order to remove the residual foregrounds @xmath72 , the contaminated sky regions have to be masked out .",
    "let @xmath74 be the corresponding mask , which is defined by @xmath75(\\hat{n})=0}$ ] .",
    "then , by construction , the masked sky @xmath76 does not contain foregrounds , @xmath77(\\hat{n}).\\ ] ] it proves then useful to define an hypothetical  unmasked \" smoothed sky map which is free of foregrounds , but contains the effects of noise and detector beam , and whose multipoles are hence given by @xmath78    the multipole coefficients of the masked sky @xmath76 are obtained by multiplication with an appropriate convolution matrix . if @xmath79 denotes the ( real ) spherical harmonic coefficients of the mask , it is easy to show that the elements of the convolution matrix are given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is defined in equation ( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "in particular , the spherical harmonic coefficients of the masked sky are given by @xmath82 in practice , we need to work with finite matrices , so we restrict our attention to a finite range of multipole values , @xmath83 .",
    "in particular we assume that @xmath84 is a square matrix .",
    "the wmap team has found that detector pixel noise is well described by a gaussian distribution with zero mean @xcite , which implies that @xmath85 therefore , the masked temperature anisotropies have zero mean if the primordial anisotropies do . according to the wmap team @xcite , the noise variance is inversely proportional to the number of times point each pixel is observed .",
    "this is not the same for all pixels , but it is is fairly isotropic ( see figure [ fig : noise ] ) .",
    "hence , assuming a constant @xmath86 , and that the noise in different pixels ( of area @xmath87 ) is uncorrelated , with variance @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 where @xmath90 . in any case , at the scales we are interested in , the contribution of the noise to the variance of the masked temperature anisotropies is subdominant .",
    "this is however not crucial for our analysis , which simply assumes that the noise satisfies equation ( [ eq : noise covariance ] ) , without reference to the actual magnitude of @xmath91 .    .",
    "the figure shows a plot of the  power spectrum \" @xmath92 in units of the monopole @xmath93 .",
    "weighted by @xmath94 , this captures the degree of anisotropy of the noise variance on angular scales @xmath95 .",
    ", height=302 ]      in order to test whether the primordial temperature anisotropies have zero mean ( which follows from @xmath96 ) we need additional information about the distribution of the harmonic coefficients @xmath97 . at this point",
    ", there is no evidence for non - gaussian primordial perturbations @xcite , so we assume that the latter are normally distributed . in order to uniquely characterize their distribution",

    "we test @xmath37 against @xmath39 . what singles out our test is the ability to examine the zero mean hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis of non - zero means .",
    "indeed , the only difference between @xmath37 and @xmath39 lies in the assumptions about the mean of the perturbations . without the alternative hypothesis ,",
    "we would be simply conducting a goodness - of - fit test .",
    "mathematically it is certainly sensible to postulate hypothesis @xmath39 , but the reader may wonder whether @xmath39 is also physically reasonable .",
    "in fact , we think it is .",
    "suppose for instance that primordial perturbations are created during an inflationary period in a slightly inhomogeneous universe ( after all , if inflation is supposed to explain cosmic homogeneity , it should start with an inhomogeneous universe . )",
    "if we regard these small inhomogeneities as first order perturbations , in linear perturbation theory the properties of the created perturbations  vacuum fluctuations of an appropriate field  only depend on the homogeneous and isotropic background . hence , the resulting seeded perturbations turn out to be homogeneous and isotropic in the mean and the variance , as in the conventional case , but they have to be added on top of the already existing initial inhomogeneities .",
    "in fact , similar ideas have been already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "if we just happened to know the temperature multipoles @xmath97 ( or their foreground - cleaned counterparts @xmath104 ) , a test of hypothesis @xmath37 against its alternative @xmath39 would be straight - forward . under the null hypothesis , for fixed @xmath99 , the variables @xmath97 form a set of independent , normally distributed variates with zero mean and common variance @xmath105 .",
    "the standard and time - honored way to test the latter involves student s @xmath0 statistic , @xmath106 where @xmath107 are , respectively , unbiased estimators of the mean and variance of the distribution . under the null hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath0 follows student s distribution with @xmath108 degrees of freedom , while under the alternative hypothesis , its square is distributed like a ratio of non - central chi - squares ( more about this below . )",
    "note that we do not need to make any assumption about the actual values of the @xmath105 in order to know how @xmath0 is distributed under the null hypothesis .    as we mentioned above , though",
    ", it is not possible to subtract part of the galactic contamination , so we are forced to work with the masked sky in equation ( [ eq : masked sky ] ) . while masking preserves the property of zero mean , equation ( [ eq : masked mean ] ) , it does not preserve the diagonal form of the covariance matrix",
    "hence , one of the key assumptions of student s test is lost . to bring the problem back to the realm of student s @xmath0",
    ", we shall impose additional symmetries on the problem .",
    "on large angular scales , the main source of foreground contamination stems from the galactic disc , which can be covered by a mask that spans galactic latitudes in the range @xmath109 .",
    "let us hence assume that the mask is symmetric under rotations around the galactic @xmath110-axis .",
    "under such rotations , the real spherical harmonics transform according to equation ( [ eq : m rotation ] ) .",
    "hence , rotational invariance implies @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "when we substitute the last relation into equation ( [ eq : mask matrix ] ) we find , using the results in the appendix , @xmath113 in other words , the mask matrix is diagonal in @xmath114 space , and we can basically restrict our attention to @xmath115 . of course , a mask with these symmetry properties can not eliminate all sources of foreground contamination ( primarily point sources ) .",
    "we shall address this problem by restricting our analysis to large angular scales , for which the contribution of point sources is small .    for notational simplicity",
    "let us call @xmath116 the ( symmetric ) matrix with elements @xmath117 , and let us collect all the multipoles @xmath118 for fixed @xmath114 into a single vector @xmath119 in this notation then , @xmath120 , and equation ( [ eq : c ] ) reads @xmath121 suppose now that we find a positive integer @xmath122 and a vector @xmath123 such that @xmath124 in other words , suppose that we find a sky @xmath125 with no components along the contaminated region , such that @xmath126 for _ all _ values of @xmath114 between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "if such a vector exists , it must clearly have vanishing components for @xmath129 , since @xmath130 can not exceed @xmath99 . under these conditions then , the @xmath131 variables @xmath132 ( with @xmath133 satisfy @xmath134 where we have used equation ( [ eq : s ] ) and @xmath135 . in particular , these variates do not contain galactic residual backgrounds , because they can be constructed from a masked sky , they have zero mean under the null hypothesis , @xmath136 and , because of equation ( [ eq : b covariance ] ) , they have covariances @xmath137 where @xmath138",
    "the off - shot of this construction is not only that the variables @xmath139 are uncorrelated ( and hence independent ) , but also that their variance , equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , is the same for all of them . note that , by construction , the variables @xmath140 only contain temperature multipoles @xmath104 in the range @xmath141 , where @xmath142 .      equation ( [ eq : covariances ] ) states that the @xmath131 variates @xmath139 ( @xmath143 ) form a set of normally distributed _ independent _ variables , with common variance @xmath144 .",
    "they are thus statistically analogous to the primordial temperature multipoles @xmath97 , which are independent and have the same variance for fixed @xmath99 . under the null hypothesis",
    "@xmath37 the @xmath139 have zero mean , and under the alternative hypothesis @xmath39 their mean is generically non - zero . because the @xmath139 are linear combinations of the normally distributed @xmath97 , the distribution of the former is also gaussian .",
    "it is hence natural to choose student s @xmath0 as test statistic , although , for later convenience , we shall actually work with its square , @xmath145 where @xmath146 intuitively , the nature of the test statistic is clear : up to factors that involve @xmath128 , @xmath147 is just the square of the ratio of sample mean to sample standard deviation .",
    "we would expect this ratio to be small if the variables indeed have zero mean , and large if they do nt .",
    "one of the keys of our test statistic is that we know its distribution both under the null and the alternative hypothesis .",
    "the identity @xmath148 implies by an extension of cochran s theorem ( section 15.20 in and section 35.7 in ) that the numerator and denominator of equation ( [ eq : t squared ] ) are independent variables , both under @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "again by the same extension of cochran s theorem , the numerator ( divided by @xmath144 ) follows a non - central chi - square distribution with @xmath149 degrees of freedom , and non - central parameter @xmath150 whereas @xmath151 ( divided by @xmath144 ) follows a non - central chi - square distribution with @xmath152 degrees of freedom , and non - central parameter @xmath153 the statistic @xmath147 is thus a ratio of non - central chi - squares divided by their respective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter follows a doubly non - central @xmath72 distribution , with probability density given by ( section 24.30 in ) @xmath154 where @xmath68 is the beta function . if all the ensemble means are equal , @xmath155 , @xmath156 vanishes , and the distribution of @xmath147 simplifies to a non - central @xmath72-distribution with degrees of freedom @xmath149 and @xmath152 , and non - central parameter @xmath157 . under the null hypothesis",
    "@xmath37 the non - central parameter is @xmath158 , and the distribution reduces to a central @xmath72 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 , which is just the square of student s @xmath0 distribution .",

    "evidently , as the number of degrees of freedom @xmath160 increases , so does the power of any of these tests.,height=302 ]      the value of the @xmath147 statistic tells us not only whether the null hypothesis holds , but also how far from zero the mean may be if the alternative hypothesis @xmath39 is the correct one .",

    "we can also extend this analysis to a set of several independent @xmath147 statistics , designed to probe the temperature anisotropies at different angular scales .",

    "as long as we stick to a single ( random ) orientation of the sky , our results have a straight - forward statistical interpretation , since all we need to know is how the test statistic is distributed for an arbitrary ( but fixed ) sky orientation .",
    "in addition , the non - scalar nature of the statistic may help us to identify that area of the sky eventually responsible for a violation of the zero mean hypothesis . to conclude , we should also point out that student s @xmath0 test is known to be robust to departures from normality , at least for _ independent _ variables drawn from the same distribution ( section 31.3 in ) .",

    "the reader not interested in technical details is welcome to skip this part and jump to the next section for the actual results .      as mentioned above , in order to eliminate galactic contamination , and preserve azimuthal symmetry at the same time , we construct a mask invariant under rotations along the galactic @xmath110-axis .",
    "our starting point is a healpix pixelization of the sphere with @xmath213 .",
    "we set all pixels in the mask with galactic latitude @xmath214 to zero , and all the remaining pixels to one .",
    "the effective area covered by the mask is @xmath215 of the full sky .",
    "we label the components of the pixelized mask by @xmath216 , where @xmath192 runs over all the @xmath217 pixels of the mask .",
    "this particular mask is in fact also symmetric under parity , but we do not make explicit use of this symmetry .      in order to find a @xmath123 that satisfies equation ( [ eq : s ] ) , we look for a common solution of the set of equations @xmath218 since @xmath116 is the mask matrix , the linear operator @xmath219 gives the components of the vector along the contaminated galactic region .",
    "hence , equation ( [ eq : null ] ) states that the vector @xmath123 should have a vanishing component along such region .    in order to find the components of @xmath123 , it is numerically more convenient to work in real space .",
    "we fix the values of @xmath220 and @xmath128 and calculate a matrix @xmath81 whose elements are defined by @xmath221 where @xmath192 runs over all pixels in a healpix pixelization of the sphere with @xmath222 , and @xmath223 .",
    "then , the set of equations ( [ eq : null ] ) reads @xmath224 , or @xmath225 we find an approximate solution of equation ( [ eq : cv ] ) by singular value decomposition , @xmath226 here , the @xmath227 is a set of @xmath228-dimensional orthonormal vectors , the @xmath229 are the singular values ( arranged in order of decreasing magnitude ) , and the @xmath230 is a set @xmath231-dimensional orthonormal vectors .",
    "we choose the vector @xmath123 to be the last right singular vector , that is , @xmath232 , with @xmath233 .",
    "we label the corresponding singular eigenvalue @xmath234 .",
    "because the vectors @xmath235 and @xmath236 are orthogonal , the singular value @xmath234 is the norm of @xmath237 , @xmath238 in general , this singular value is non - zero , so our solution of equation ( [ eq : cv ] ) is not exact but only approximate .",
    "modulo a normalization factor , the value of @xmath234 is then an indicator of the potential degree of contamination , i.e. , the overlap between our vector @xmath123 and the contaminated galactic region .",
    "the latter typically increases with increasing @xmath128 , since the number of non - zero elements of @xmath239 freely available to solve equation ( [ eq : cv ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath128 .",
    "because the power of the @xmath147 test increases with the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath160 , we choose the maximum possible value of @xmath128 for which @xmath234 , divided by the norm of the mask times the norm of sky encoded in @xmath123 , remains under @xmath240 .",
    "indeed , the resulting vector can be represented visually , by defining the sky @xmath241 which captures those regions of the sky that enter our statistic . as an example , the corresponding real space sky for @xmath242 and @xmath243 is shown in figure [ fig : v ] .",
    "the same process can be repeated for different choices of @xmath220 and @xmath128 .",
    "if the corresponding intervals ( [ eq : interval ] ) do not overlap , we can use the resulting set of vectors @xmath123 to construct a set of mutually independent @xmath147 statistics , as explained in subsection [ sec : extension ] .    ) , for @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "those regions of the sky with the largest values are those that are more heavily weighted in our statistic , as implied by equation ( [ eq : e and b ] ) .",
    "as seen in the figure , the galactic region is basically excluded from our analysis . for other choices of @xmath220 and @xmath128",
    "the structure of the sky is the same , as long as the singular eigenvalue @xmath234 remains sufficiently small.[fig : v],height=302 ]      we analyze the seven - year ( version 4 ) , full resolution , foreground - reduced q2 , v2 and w1 differencing assembly cosmic microwave anisotropy maps provided by the wmap mission . since these maps probe different frequencies of the microwave spectrum",
    ", a dependence of our results on the particular map would indicate non - thermal foreground contamination .",
    "we expect the latter to be smallest for the w and v maps , and largest for the q map .",
    "we thus take the w1 assembly to be our fiducial map , and keep the v2 and q2 assemblies just for comparison .",
    "the wmap has subtracted the dipole and primordial monopole from the three differencing assemblies , and the latter have been smoothed with a gaussian kernel @xmath71 of @xmath244 .",
    "the sky maps are expanded into ( real ) spherical harmonics , and band - limited to a maximum multipole value @xmath245 .",
    "the different values of @xmath220 are chosen iteratively to cover the multipole range @xmath246 with non - overlapping intervals .",
    "we choose @xmath247 as the absolute maximum for @xmath99 because we expect point sources to significantly contaminate the temperature anisotropies at higher multipoles .",
    "note that it is not necessary to mask the sky prior to processing , since the vector @xmath123 has no components along the galactic region by construction .",
    "there are two main possible sources of systematic errors in our analysis : galactic contamination due to an insufficiently resolved mask or an imperfect solution of equations ( [ eq : null ] ) , and point source contamination due to unmasked high - latitude point sources . in order to estimate both we basically follow the same approach .",
    "let us assume that the values of @xmath220 and @xmath128 have been fixed . to estimate the amount of galactic contamination , we subtract from the cosmic microwave maps the portion of the sky covered by the wmap seven - year temperature analysis mask and run the resulting sky map through the analysis pipeline described above .",
    "the change in the @xmath248-value of the @xmath147 statistic is then a measure of galactic contamination . for @xmath242 and @xmath243 for instance ,",
    "the change in the @xmath147 statistic after subtraction of the galaxy is less @xmath249 for the w1 map .    similarly , to estimate the amount of point source contamination we construct a sky map of temperature anisotropies from the point source fluxes listed in the wmap point - source catalog @xcite .",
    "we subtract the point source map from the cosmic microwave background and run the resulting sky map through our data analysis pipeline .",
    "the change in the corresponding @xmath248-value of the @xmath147 statistic is then a measure of point source contamination .",
    "certainly , there are unresolved point sources that the wmap catalog does not contain , but the contribution of these sources is small compared to the contribution of the actually detected sources that we are not able to mask .",
    "say , if we choose @xmath242 and @xmath243 , the change in the @xmath147 statistic after point source subtraction is less @xmath250 for the w1 map .",
    "point sources do not typically have thermal spectra , so an inspection of our results for different differencing assemblies gives us yet another handle on such contamination .",
    "an alternative way to estimate point source contamination involves the ratio @xmath251 where the @xmath252 are the multipoles of the temperature map constructed from detected point sources alone , and the @xmath97 are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the analyzed sky ( say , the @xmath253 map ) .",
    "the sums in @xmath254 only run over @xmath114 , because our statistics are sensitive only to a relatively small window of multipoles in @xmath99 space . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig : point sources ] , @xmath254 remains below @xmath250 up to @xmath255 , which is in broad agreement with our direct estimate of point source contamination using the @xmath147 statistic . because point source contamination decreases with the frequency of the map @xcite , the w1 differencing assembly is less contaminated than the other two assemblies",
    "this is why we take w1 to be our fiducial map .",
    "note by the way that none of the procedures described above is an actual attempt to subtract galactic or point source contamination .",
    "instead , it is just a way to estimate the contribution of the unmasked foregrounds to the @xmath248-value of our statistic .    ) .",

    "our results are summarized in table [ tab : results ] and represented graphically in figure [ fig : p values ] .",
    "there are two multipole ranges in which the @xmath248-value of our @xmath147 statistic is smaller than @xmath256 . in the first case , for @xmath257 ,",
    "the @xmath248-value across the three differencing assemblies remains under @xmath258 , so it does not seem that this result is due to residual foregrounds alone",
    ". in particular , in this multipole range point source contamination is negligible . in the second case",
    ", for @xmath259 , the @xmath248-value of the statistic for the q2 map is normal , so we may tentatively attribute the difference in the values of @xmath147 among maps to foreground contamination .",
    "this explanation however is somewhat problematic , because we expect foregrounds to make the actual value of @xmath147 less likely , and because contamination is stronger in the q2 map , whose @xmath147 is normal .",
    "can we speak then of statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis ? to answer this question ,",
    "we need to realize that we have constructed a set of @xmath260 independent tests of the null hypothesis , one for each multipole range . hence",
    ", if we would like the of all individual statistics to be larger than @xmath161 with probability @xmath261 ( under the null hypothesis ) , we should choose the size @xmath161 of each individual test to satisfy @xmath262 for @xmath260 and @xmath263 , this yields @xmath264 .",
    "none of the @xmath248-values in table [ tab : results ] is as low .",
    "we reach similar conclusions by calculating the value of a statistic often used to combine the results of multiple independent tests of a single hypothesis : stouffer s weighted @xmath265 test @xcite .",

    "<S> we find evidence for a non - zero mean in a particular range of multipoles , but the evidence against the zero mean hypothesis goes away when we correct for multiple testing . </S>",
    "<S> we also place constraints on the mean of the temperature multipoles as a function of angular scale . on angular scales </S>",
    "<S> smaller than four degrees , a non - zero mean has to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the standard deviation of the temperature anisotropies . </S>"
