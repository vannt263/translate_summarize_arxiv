    "it is well known that progressive motion of topological solitons ( _ kinks _ ) in lossy media can be supported by a dc ( constant ) field which couples to the soliton s topological charge @xcite . in this case , the kink is , effectively , a quasiparticle .",
    "the same quasiparticle approximation strongly suggests that ac ( time - periodic with zero mean value ) field(s ) applied to the kink in an infinitely long homogeneous system can only give rise to its oscillatory motion .",
    "a more sophisticated possibility is to drive a kink by a pure ac force in a lossy system subjected to a periodic spatial modulation . in particular ,",
    "spatial periodicity is an inherent feature of discrete systems ( dynamical lattices ) . as it was first predicted in an analytical form for damped lattices of the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) and toda types in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , and for a periodically modulated lossy continuum system of the sine - gordon ( sg ) type in ref .",
    "@xcite , resonances ( of different orders ) between the time - periodic driving force and periodic passage of a moving kink through the spatial inhomogeneities make it possible to support progressive motion of the kink without any dc field .",
    "this mechanism selects absolute values of the mean velocity of the ac - driven kink which provide for the resonance of the order @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the frequency of the ac drive and the period of the spatial modulation .",
    "the sign of the velocity is determined by a random initial push applied to the kink .",
    "while the velocity selected by the locking condition ( [ resonance ] ) does not depend on the amplitude of the ac drive , the driven progressive motion can not take place unless the drive s amplitude @xmath6 exceeds a certain minimum ( threshold ) value @xmath7 , which is usually proportional to the friction coefficient @xcite .",
    "the effect was generalized to include a case when a combination of ac and dc fields is applied @xcite . in this case ,",
    "a _ constant - velocity step _ is predicted , in the form of an ac - frequency - locked value ( [ resonance ] ) of the mean velocity of the driven kink in a finite interval of values of the dc component of the drive .",
    "the possibility of stable ac - driven motion of the soliton in the lossy toda lattice has been later demonstrated in simulations @xcite and in a laboratory experiment with an electrical transmission line described by this model @xcite .",
    "search for such regimes in fk models turned out to be more difficult , but simulations have finally demonstrated that the soliton in the form of a dislocation may be driven with a nonzero mean velocity by the ac force @xcite .    in terms of physical applications , the most appropriate medium where these effects may be realized is provided by long josephson junctions ( ljjs ) @xcite , which support topological solitons in the form of trapped fluxons ( magnetic - flux quanta @xcite ) . a convenient way to implement the periodic spatial modulation in ljj",
    "is to apply constant ( dc ) magnetic field to an annular ( and sufficiently long ) junction , with the field s vector lying in the plane of the annular junction . in this case",
    ", the full length of the ring - shaped junction plays the role of the modulation period @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ resonance ] ) . note that the use of the ljj of the annular shape is very natural also because it preserves the number of fluxons trapped in it .",
    "the necessary drive can be readily provided by ac electric bias current distributed along the junction .    as it was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this configuration gives rise to a harmonic spatial modulation in the corresponding sg model , the modulation amplitude being proportional to the external magnetic field ( the perturbation generated by the magnetic field is formally tantamount to an additional spatially modulated dc drive with zero average ) .",
    "the resonant relation ( [ resonance ] ) applies to this case , the period @xmath5 being the circumference of the annular junction , as it was mentioned above .",
    "experimental observation of the ac - driven motion of a fluxon in the annular ljj in the presence of the constant magnetic field was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the form of nonzero dc voltage across the junction , induced by ac bias current applied to it .",
    "a related issue is progressive motion of the fluxon under the action of a pure ac drive , or even a random drive , in the so - called _ ratchet _ ( asymmetric ) effective potential @xcite .",
    "however , a principal difference is that , in the case of the ratchet , there is an _ a priori _ selected preferred direction of motion . experimental realization of a ratchet for fluxons in ljjs was very recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , ac - driven progressive motion of a topological soliton in an indefinitely long lossy system can only be possible if it is assisted by the spatial periodic modulation .",
    "the objective of this work is to show , both numerically and analytically , that , quite surprisingly , the ordinary spatially uniform ac drive may support progressive , on average , motion of a fluxon in either direction in the perfectly _ uniform _ annular junction with non - zero losses , provided that the amplitude of the drive exceeds a certain threshold value .",
    "the effect is clearly stipulated by the finite size of the ring - like junction , being possible because a fluxon perturbed by the driving field may emit small - amplitude ( quasi - linear ) waves ( radiation , alias `` plasmons '' or `` phonons '' ) propagating along the junction and eventually hitting the same fluxon .",
    "we note that a somewhat similar effect was observed in numerical simulations reported in recent preprints @xcite , which , however , was related to the above - mentioned ratchet mechanism supporting unidirectional motion of ac - driven fluxons , and the ac drive was always a two - frequency one .",
    "it was stated that the progressive motion is possible due to the simultaneous action of driving forces oscillating at frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the absence of static spatial potential .",
    "we stress that in our work the ac drive is always represented by a single - frequency harmonic .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "numerical results which show the ac - driven progressive motion of the fluxon are displayed in section [ sec : simres ] .",
    "a theoretical explanation , that reflects our understanding of the effect , which is based on interaction of the fluxon with its own radiation `` tails '' , is set forth in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "comparison of the analytical and numerical results is presented in section [ sec : disc ] , and section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the work .",

    "this , in a sense , means that instead of one point on the @xmath41 dependence we get 100 closely situated points .",
    "if the dynamics is chaotic those 100 points will have large spread in @xmath42 . on the other hand , all the points will give almost equal values of @xmath42 if the dynamics is regular and averaging converges .",

    "results produced by means of both methods will be displayed below .",
    "first , we present dependencies @xmath45 generated by the averaging method ( i ) .",
    "four characteristic examples of the dependencies , obtained by increasing ( gray points ) and decreasing ( black points ) the drive s amplitude @xmath16 for the annular ljj of the length @xmath46 , with the dissipation constant @xmath47 and four different values of the driving frequency @xmath4 , are shown in fig .",

    "the average velocity @xmath42 increases with @xmath16 , but at @xmath59 a transition to a chaotic - like behavior takes place . in the latter case , the averaging over a long time interval does not produce any definite value of the mean velocity .",
    "closer inspection of this region shows that we are dealing not with true chaos , but rather with a deterministic quasi - periodic regime with a nonzero average velocity . in particular",
    ", the fundamental frequency of the corresponding time series is , effectively , incommensurate with the ac driving frequency in this case , that is why the average velocity can not be effectively calculated using the algorithm described above .",
    "continuing the consideration of fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) , we notice a split branch in the interval @xmath60 , where the average velocity is @xmath61 .",
    "accurate inspection shows that the averaging during one period yields a point belonging to one branch , while averaging over the next period produces a point situated on the other branch , and so on .",
    "this means that the fundamental frequency of the oscillatory component of the fluxon s motion is _ half _ the driving frequency .",
    "while generation of higher harmonics is common to all nonlinear systems , the appearance of sub - harmonics is a more specific effect , implying the existence of a certain form of parametric instability . for larger values of @xmath16 ,",
    "the system enters the region of chaos , which is shortly interrupted by a deterministic branch with a nonzero average velocity in the interval @xmath62 .    for driving frequencies that are @xmath63 higher than the josephson plasma frequency ( which is @xmath14 in the notation adopted above )",
    ", one can observe the fluxon s motion with a nonzero average velocity in a broad range of @xmath16 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the average velocity may attain relatively large values , which become comparable to the swihart velocity of the junction ( @xmath64 in our notation ) .",

    "[ fig : u(gamma)](d ) @xmath65 at @xmath66 , and reaches the value @xmath67 for larger values of @xmath16 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the dependence @xmath68 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](d ) features an additional step at @xmath69 , which suggests that there are two different mechanisms which generate the nonzero average velocity .",
    "the additional step may correspond to switching of the system between these two different mechanisms .        to visualize the fluxon motion , in fig .",
    "[ fig : x(t ) ] we present the law of motion , @xmath70 , of the fluxon s center for different values of the ac driving amplitude and fixed driving frequency @xmath57 , which corresponds to the dependence @xmath45 shown in fig .  [ fig : u(gamma)](b ) .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : x(t)](a ) that , indeed , at @xmath71 a systematic drift of the fluxon in one direction is superimposed on periodic oscillations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : x(t ) ] ( b ) , which corresponds to the quasi - periodic motion at @xmath72 , we see that the fluxon motion is qualitatively similar to that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : x(t ) ] , but it is less regular and nonperiodic .    the fluxon s law of motion for the case which corresponds to the generation of the sub - harmonic at @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x(t)](c ) .",
    "one can easily see that the period  of the oscillatory part of the soliton s motion in this case is indeed twice the period of the ac drive , as the trajectories look slightly different during alternating ( even and the odd ) periods of the ac drive .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : x(t)](d ) one can see the trajectories corresponding to the point @xmath73 , which belongs to a narrow window in fig .",

    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) ; and ( b ) a smaller spatial step of the finite - difference integration scheme .",

    "[ fig : cmp - diff - av](a ) . as is seen from the comparison of this figure with fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) , details of the pictures generated by the averaging procedures ( i ) and ( ii ) are somewhat different inside the chaotic regions .",
    "nevertheless , both methods identify the same regions of the regular motion , and yield the same dependencies @xmath45 in the regular cases .",
    "in fact , the consideration of the regular motion with nonzero average velocity , rather than of chaotic regimes , is the main subject of this work .",
    "our numerical simulations of the perturbed sg equation ( [ eq : sg ] ) used a finite - difference scheme .",
    "since the ac - driven progressive motion of kinks is possible in indefinitely long discrete lossy lattices @xcite , it is necessary to check that the effects reported above are not artifacts produced by the discretization of the model . to this end",
    ", simulations were run with the smaller value of the step size @xmath75 of the finite - difference scheme .",
    "comparing the results , we have concluded that they are almost identical , except for small variations in the location of the thresholds at which the system switches from one state to the other .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : cmp - diff - av](b ) displays the dependence @xmath45 obtained for the same case as in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) , but with @xmath76 , rather than @xmath77 used in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) . as for the different signs of the average velocity in some regions of the regular motion in figs .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) and [ fig : cmp - diff - av](b ) , this sign is always randomly selected by the initial conditions , as it was explained above .",
    "the numerical results presented above clearly demonstrate that progressive motion of fluxon can indeed be supported , in either direction , by the uniformly distributed ac drive ( bias current ) in annular uniform weakly damped ljj .",
    "an explanation to the effect will be proposed in the next section .",
    "the analysis developed below is based on a basic property of the system under consideration : the fluxon oscillating under the action of the ac drive emits plasma waves in both directions , and , due to the annular shape of the junction , these waves interact with the same fluxon after completing a round trip .",
    "however , this property does not offer an immediate explanation to the possibility that the fluxon will be able to systematically drift in one direction , if pushed initially .",
    "therefore , a detailed analysis is necessary , which is developed below .",
    "as it is known from earlier works on the perturbation theory ( pt ) for the sg equation ( see a review @xcite ) , a kink ( fluxon ) oscillating , without any systematic progressive motion , under the action of the ac drive emits radiation , in the lowest approximation , to the left and to the right at two wavenumbers @xmath78 , where @xmath79 provided that @xmath80 , i.e. , that the driving frequency exceeds the plasma frequency of the junction . if @xmath81 , the emission takes place in higher orders of pt ( at higher harmonics ) .    here , we concentrate on the case @xmath80",
    ". the numerical results ( both displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : u(gamma ) ] and those which are not shown here ) suggest that the strongest effect takes place when @xmath82 is a positive but relatively small parameter . in this case , the application of pt , which needs the drive s amplitude @xmath16 and the damping coefficient @xmath15 to be small , predicts that the oscillating fluxon emits two waves , which , far from the fluxon , have the following form ( neglecting , for the time being , the action of the dissipation ) : @xmath83 the amplitude of the two emitted waves is predicted by pt to be @xcite @xmath84 which is correct if @xmath85 in fact , the former inequality does not hold in many cases when the simulation reveal the progressive motion of the ac - driven fluxon , but this is not a principal limitation : instead of the expression ( [ amplitude ] ) , one can use more general ones ( 6.23 ) and ( 6.18 ) from ref .",
    "in such a case , a relation between @xmath86 and the drive s amplitude @xmath87 is more complex than that given by eq .",

    "( [ slow ] ) can be replaced by the expressions ( [ amplitude ] ) and ( [ tilde ] ) , which casts the equation into a form @xmath135 \\alpha { \\overline{u}}\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\frac{\\pi l\\alpha \\gamma _ { { \\rm ac}}}{8k^{3}}\\right ) ^{2}\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{\\alpha l}{2k}\\right ) \\sin \\left ( kl\\right ) \\cdot { \\overline{u}}^{3 } ,   \\label{motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the threshold value of the drive s amplitude is defined as @xmath136    the equation of motion ( [ motion ] ) has a trivial stationary solution ( trivial _ fixed point _ , fp ) @xmath91 , which , obviously , corresponds to no systematic motion of the fluxon .",
    "a crucially important issue is the stability of this fp .",
    "the linearization of eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) for @xmath137 immediately demonstrates that the trivial fp is _ unstable _ if the drive s amplitude exceeds the threshold value given by eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) . in this case , a transition to a nontrivial regime with a _ nonzero velocity _ of the progressive motion ( in other words , a bifurcation ) must take place .",
    "an essential feature of the expression ( [ threshold ] ) is its dependence on the phase @xmath124 gained by the emitted wave as a result of the round trip .",
    "in fact , the ac - driven motion is predicted to exist only if @xmath138 , or , as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) , @xmath139 in the opposite case , the effect is absent , or , possibly , the threshold amplitude is very large ( then the perturbative approach is irrelevant ) .    if @xmath140 , the existence of two mutually symmetric nontrivial fps , with finite velocities @xmath92 , may be expected .",
    "one can try to find these velocities close to the bifurcation point , i.e. , for a case @xmath141 , taking into account the cubic corrections in eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) .",
    "in fact , in the particular approximation in which the cubic term , which is present in eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) , was derived , a formal result will be @xmath142 , which , actually , implies that the bifurcation is _ subcritical _ , i.e. , it takes place by a finite jump ; in the opposite case , one should expect a soft supercritical transition ( corresponding to a bifurcation of the usual pitchfork type @xcite ) without a jump .",
    "the bifurcations observed in figs .",
    "1(a ) and , especially , in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](b ) look very much like a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation , while figs . 1(c ) and 1(d ) , corresponding to larger values of the parameter @xmath125 , strongly suggest that a subcritical bifurcation ( the one giving rise to a jump ) takes place in these cases . in many other runs of the simulations ,",
    "not displayed here , we observed a very similar trend , namely , to have a supercritical bifurcation for very small values of @xmath143 , and a transition to a subcritical bifurcation at somewhat larger @xmath143 .",
    "an accurate prediction of the type of the bifurcation ( sub- or super - critical ) is a rather difficult issue , as it demands precise summation of the lowest - order nonlinear corrections at the order @xmath144 , that may originate from many different terms in the above analysis .",
    "lastly , we note that the case shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : u(gamma)](a ) , with the driving frequency @xmath145 , which is smaller than @xmath14 , can not be directly explained in the framework of the approach developed here .",
    "however , it seems very plausible that the persistent motion of the ac - driven fluxon in this case can be explained if one takes into regard the fact that the kink oscillating under the action of the driving frequency @xmath81 emits radiation at the second - harmonic frequency @xmath146 , provided that @xmath147 @xcite , which is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](a ) . in accord with this , the effect seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : u(gamma)](a ) is very weak because it is accounted for by the second order of pt .",
    "the main prediction of the analysis presented in the previous section is the loss of stability of the zero - average - velocity state of the fluxon in the ac - driven weakly damped annular uniform ljj . as a result",
    ", the fluxon must inevitably perform a transition to a nontrivial state with a nonzero average velocity , which we consider as the cause for the effect revealed by the simulations . besides that , the analysis may , in principle , predict the character of the bifurcation ",
    "super- or sub - critical .",
    "while the comparison of the particular type of the analytically predicted bifurcation with results of the simulations is a sophisticated problem , it is much more straightforward ( and more important ) to compare the theoretically predicted and numerically found points of the transition to the progressive motion , i.e. , as a matter of fact , dependencies of the threshold amplitude of the ac drive on various parameters of the system . a crucially important prediction of the analysis is the fact that the transition to the nonzero velocity occurs ( within the framework of the perturbation theory ) only in those intervals of values of the ring s length @xmath5 ( if all the other parameters are fixed ) where the condition ( [ threshold ] ) holds .",
    "another important and , in the same time , simple prediction is that the threshold value ( [ threshold ] ) remains finite ( neither vanishes nor diverges ) in the limit @xmath148 .     and @xmath149 .",
    "]    comparing the analytical and numerical results , we focused on these two basic features . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thr(l ) ] , the threshold value of the ac - drive s amplitude , as found from the simulations , is plotted vs. the length @xmath5 of the annular junction for fixed values @xmath150 and @xmath47 .",
    "salient peculiarities of the dependence are existence of two minima at @xmath151 on the other hand , the value of the wavenumber corresponding to @xmath152 is @xmath153 [ see eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) ] , and eq .  ( [ threshold ] ) then predicts minimum values of the threshold at the points where @xmath154 , i.e. , at @xmath155 comparison of the numerical results ( [ min ] ) with the analytical predictions ( [ theormin ] ) demonstrates very good agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : thr(l ) ] also shows that @xmath156 diverges at some point between the two minima , and in a part of the region between them , where the data is absent in the figure , the effect does not take place at all ( or the threshold is extremely high ) .",
    "this feature also agrees well with the theoretical prediction ( [ threshold ] ) , which yields divergences at points @xmath157 with integer @xmath158 , and nonexistence of the effect in the intervals where the condition ( [ condition ] ) does not hold .",
    "however , unlike the minima points , detailed comparison of the numerically found and analytically predicted positions of the divergence points is not relevant , as the perturbation theory which was used to derive eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) clearly breaks down in a vicinity of the divergence points .    .",
    "the length of the annular josephson junction and driving frequency are @xmath46 and @xmath159 .",
    "the upper branch of the plot corresponds to the case when simulations start with a quiescent fluxon , and the drive s amplitude is gradually increased till the fluxon starts to drift .",
    "the lower branch corresponds to the opposite case , when the simulations start with a fluxon moving under the action of a sufficiently strong drive , and the amplitude is gradually decreased till the fluxon ceases to drift . ]    to verify the analytical prediction for the threshold amplitude of the ac drive as a function of the dissipative constant @xmath15 , the dependence @xmath160 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thr(alpha ) ] .",
    "the first noteworthy feature of the plot is strong hysteresis . for the comparison with the analytical prediction ,",
    "the relevant branch is the upper one , which corresponds to `` sweeping up '' , i.e. , gradual increase of @xmath161 , as precisely in this case we can detect the point at which the zero - average - velocity state becomes unstable , and the fluxon starts its progressive motion .    as it is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : thr(alpha ) ] , this branch of the dependence of @xmath156 vs. @xmath15 indeed yields a finite value in the limit @xmath148 , as it is predicted by eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) ; it should be stressed , though , that accurate simulations are quite difficult for very small @xmath15 , as relaxation of the dynamical regime to its established form is very slow in this case . a particular value that eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) yields for @xmath162 in the case shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : thr(l ) ] and [ fig : thr(alpha ) ] , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath150 , is @xmath163 , which roughly agrees with what can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig : thr(alpha ) ] .",
    "this work presents a novel dynamical effect : systematic drift of a topological soliton in an ac - driven weakly damped system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the effect has been demonstrated in a physically relevant model of a long josephson junction in the form of a ring , where fluxons play the role of kinks , and the ac drive is realized as bias current uniformly applied to the junction . unlike earlier considered cases of progressive motion of the ac driven fluxon , in the present case the long junction and the ac driving force are spatially uniform .",
    "numerical simulations reveal that progressive ( on average ) motion of the fluxon commences if the amplitude of the ac drive exceeds a certain threshold value . with the increase of the amplitude ,",
    "both regular and chaotic dynamical regimes are observed .",
    "the direction of the progressive motion is randomly selected by initial conditions , and regular dynamical regimes are characterized by strong hysteresis .",
    "the simulations demonstrate the effect in a well - pronounced form in the case when the driving frequency exceeds , but its rather close to , the plasma frequency of the junction .",
    "the analytical approach to the problem was based on consideration of the interaction between plasma waves emitted by the fluxon oscillating under the action of the ac drive and the fluxon itself , after the waves complete the round trip along the annular junction and hit the fluxon . in particular , a weaker effect , which is observed in the case when the driving frequency is smaller than the plasma frequency ,",
    "may be explained by the emission of the plasma waves at the second harmonic by the oscillating fluxon .",
    "the main finding which the analytical consideration yields is possible instability of the zero - average - velocity state of the fluxon interacting with its own radiation tails .",
    "the instability sets in if the drive s amplitude exceeds an explicitly found threshold .",
