    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our survey aims at a limiting magnitude of l@xmath21 for an elliptical galaxy at z@xmath31.5 ( 5@xmath4 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : tab2 ] shows the limiting magnitudes and the required exposure times .",
    "the multi - colour - classification scheme developed for the cadis and combo-17 surveys ( ( * ? ? ? * wolf , meisenheimer & rser 2001 ) ) will classify all objects and assign photometric redshifts .",
    "however , the accuracy of the redshifts will be not as accurate though sufficient for cluster detections .",
    "we will employ a 3-dimensional cluster finding algorithm based on finding overdensities in position on the sky and in redshift space . according to",
    "its redshift z@xmath5 derived from the multi - colour - classification the projected abell radius r@xmath6 for each object is calculated and the number of objects n@xmath7 within r@xmath6 counted .",
    "only objects with velocity differences below a given threshold are added to n@xmath7 : @xmath8    candidate galaxy clusters are found as excess numbers in n@xmath7 which exceed values expected for a random object distribution . from these excess numbers we define an overdensity parameter .    a first test application to the object catalog of the chandra deep - field south ( cdfs ) observed by combo-17 ( field size 31@xmath9@xmath1030@xmath9 ) reveals galaxy overdensities at z@xmath110.5 , 0.7 and 1.1 ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) . in the past several other techniques for identifying clusters of galaxies have been developed .",
    "we intend to compare the performance of our algorithm with the voronoi tessellation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ramella , boschin , fadda & nonino 2001 ) ) , the matched - filter and the friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "because of the imaging in five filters we will also be able to apply the red sequence approach established for the toronto red - sequence cluster survey ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gladders & yee 2000 ) ) for various colour combinations .",
    "since august 2003 we are collecting the survey data at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope and since december 2002 with the wide - field - imager ( wfi ) at the eso 2.2 m telescope . a first impression of the quality of the ir data gives a pipeline - reduced mosaic of 12 h - band images in the hirocs-22h field observed with the nir wide - field camera omega2000 on this webpage :    http://www.caha.es/newsletter/news04a/omega2000@xmath12mosaic.pdf + it covers almost 3/4@xmath13 ; the psf is @xmath110.@xmath148 .",
    "each frame is composed of 25 single exposures with 1 minute exposure time , the limit is 19.9mag ( 5@xmath4 ) .",
    "the holes around bright objects are due to over - corrected background , as the pipeline , whose result is shown , uses only a local sky determination ."
