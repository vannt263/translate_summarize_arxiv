    "there are various phenomena in nature including complex , chaotic , turbulent , critical , fractal and anomalous transport phenomena having erratic trajectories with often non - differentiable characteristics . such ` anomalous ' phenomena as a rule can not be described by standard approaches involving integer order partial differential equations .",
    "however , it has been shown that they often can be described by non - integer order , i.e. fractional differential equations @xcite .",
    "there are many definitions for fractional derivatives and integrals ( riemann , liouville , caputo , grnwald - letnikow , marchaud , weyl , riesz , feller , and others ) , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this diversity of definitions is due to the fact that fractional operators take different kernel representations in different function spaces which is a consequence of the nonlocal character of fractional kernels .",
    "whereas fractional operators are well known in the continuous space and obtained as power law convolutional kernels , the fractional calculus on discrete networks and lattices is more involved and much less developed .",
    "an approach to define fractional differential operators on lattices was suggested in the papers @xcite . in @xcite",
    "was suggested the fractional calculus which includes fractional difference operators and fractional integro - differential operators on lattices where exact results have been presented in these works ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to that approach , the goal of the present work is to introduce _ fractional centered difference operators _ on the lattice appearing as a natural fractional generalization of born von karman s centered symmetric second order difference operator . in the same time all good properties of the classical born von karman lattice approach such as translational symmetry and elastic stability is conserved by the fractional lattice model to be developed in the present paper . in this way",
    "the present approach opens the door towards a generalization of the classical lattice approaches @xcite .    in the context of markovian processes on networks ,",
    "the concept of ` fractional diffusion on undirected networks ' generalizing the ` normal random walk ' was recently introduced by riascos and mateos @xcite .",
    "such random motions on lattices are defined by diffusion equations where instead of discrete laplacian matrices defined by second order difference operators their fractional generalizations come into play . in these works",
    "it has been demonstrated that fractional generalizations of lattice models have a huge interdisciplinary potential as they are able to describe phenomena which account for nonlocal interactions including the emergence of lvy flights on lattices @xcite .",
    "fractional generalizations second order difference operators introduce nonlocal long - range features .",
    "in contrast to fractional orders , the standard finite differences of integer orders describe local nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the nonlocality increases with the integer order of the power .",
    "the difference operators of integer orders at the lattice level correspond to spatial forms of non - local lattice sums and the relations of differences and differential operators defined by infinite series are analyzed in recent articles @xcite , and further a fractional generalization of lattice derivative approach was introduced in @xcite .    beside the applications on diffusion problems on the lattice , the importance of fractional lattice models appears also for a description of fractional lattice vibrational phenomena , a generalization of crystal lattice dynamics .",
    "some initial steps towards such a fractional generalization generalization of nonlinear classical lattice dynamics has been introduced by laskin and zaslavsky @xcite and tarasov and zaslavsky @xcite . in a lattice dynamics model which defines by hamilton s variational principle the ` laplacian matrix ' which contains all constitutive information of the harmonic interparticle interactions , it is therefore desirable to develop a ` fractional generalization ' of the existing lattice dynamics approach . to this end in the present paper",
    "we utilize the methodology of characteristic matrix function which was introduced recently @xcite .",
    "the interdisciplinary fractional lattice approach developed in the present paper allows to describe all types of physical fields in the harmonic approximation defined on lattices having a continuum limit governed by a non - classical , ` anomalous ' power - law nonlocality in the form of riesz fractional derivative kernels .",
    "physical applications include especially problems of fractionally generalized lattice dynamics : lattice vibrations , elastic wave propagation , nonlocal elasticity , nonlocal electrodynamics , fractional quantum mechanics on lattices and networks , and last but not least above mentioned anomalous transport and diffusion phenomena with ` fractional random walk models ' and emergence of lvy flights . the entire set of problems of classical lattice dynamics in the harmonic approximation @xcite can be fractionally generalized by the present approach .",
    "this generalization contains only one characteristic parameter , namely the power - law index @xmath3 . newly emerging phenomena of this ` fractionalization '",
    "are to be expected .",
    "the classical ( born von karman ) theories are contained in the approach at the value @xmath2 . since the present fractional lattice approach is well defined by hamilton s variational principle",
    ", it provides a physically admissible nonlocal generalization of any classical harmonic lattice model .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the first part of the paper we deduce from  fractional harmonic lattice potentials \" on the cyclically closed linear chain a discrete fractional laplacian matrix .",
    "we do so by applying our recent approach to generate nonlocal lattice models by matrix functions where the generator operator is the discrete centered born von karman laplacian @xcite .",
    "first we obtain the discrete fractional laplacian in explicit form for the infinite chain for particle numbers @xmath4 , being in accordance with the fractional centered difference models of ortiguiera @xcite and zoia et al .",
    "@xcite . utilizing the discrete infinite chain fractional laplacian matrix we construct an explicit representation for the _ fractional laplacian matrix on the @xmath5-periodic finite 1d lattice _ where the particle number @xmath5 can be arbitrary not necessarily large .",
    "then we analyse continuum limits of the discrete fractional model : the infinite space continuum limit of the fractional laplacian matrix yields the well known infinite space kernel of the standard fractional laplacian .",
    "the periodic string continuum limit yields an explicit representation for the kernel of the fractional laplacian ( riesz fractional derivative ) which fulfills periodic boundary conditions and is defined on the finite @xmath6-periodic string .",
    "in the second part of the paper we suggest an extension of the fractional approach on nd periodic and infinite lattices .",
    "we deduce an integral representation for fractional laplacian on the infinite nd lattice and proof that as asymptotic representation the well known riesz fractional derivative of the nd infinite space is emerging .",
    "more detailed derivations of some of the results of the present paper can be found in recent articles @xcite .",
    "all these results are fully equivalent and can also be deduced by employing the more general approach of riascos and mateos for fractional diffusion problems on networks @xcite , and see also the references therein .",
