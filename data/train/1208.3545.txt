    "having decided to retile your bathroom this week - end , you go to your favorite retailer of construction products .",
    "there , you see a unusual special offer on two strange notched tiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] ) : `` pay the squares cash , get the rhombi for free ! '' +        fearing that this might be a scam , you try to figure out how your bathroom could be tiled at little cost . after careful consideration , you see that the possible tilings are exactly those where any two rhombi adjacent or connected by lined up squares have different orientations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alternance ] ) .",
    "in particular , rhombi only do not tile , so you would have to buy at least some squares .",
    "you could of course tile with squares only ( on a grid ) , but this would be missing this special offer ! +        we will show that the cheapest ( if not the simplest ) way to tile your bathroom is to form a non - periodic tiling , namely an _",
    "ammann - beenker tiling_. furthermore , we will show that the set of all possible tilings form a one - parameter family of tilings which can all be seen as digitization of two - dimensional planes in the four - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "[ fig : tilings ] depicts some possible tilings , with the rightmost one being an ammann - beenker tiling .",
    "+ this is of course not only of interest to tile bathrooms , but it could provide a new insight into the theory of quasicrystals .",
    "indeed , digitizations of irrational planes in higher dimensional spaces ( also called _ projection tilings _ ) are a common model of quasicrystals , and the above results give an example of how very simple local constraints can enforce long range order , with the non - periodicity simply coming from tile proportions .",
    "in particular , slight variations of tile proportions around those of a non - periodic tiling can lead to close periodic tilings , reminding approximants of quasicrystals .",
    "+         the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : ammann_beenker ] briefly recalls the history of ammann - beenker tilings .",
    "sections [ sec : tilings ] and [ sec : shadows ] introduce the main notions , section [ sec : algebra ] makes a simple but powerful connection with classic results of algebraic geometry , and the technical part of our proof is exposed in section [ sec : planarity ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] by formally stating our main result ( theorem  [ th : main ] ) .",
    "ammann - beenker tilings are non - periodic tilings of the plane by a square and a rhombus with a @xmath0 angle . enjoying a ( local ) @xmath1-fold symmetry",
    ", they became a popular model of the @xmath1-fold quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "they were introduced by ammann in the 1970s and beenker in 1982 , independantly and from different viewpoints .",
    "+ on the one hand , ammann defined these tilings as the ones that can be formed by two specific notched tiles and a `` key '' tile , with the non - periodicity deriving from the hierarchical structure enforced by the notching . this can be compared to the first ( and concomitant ) definition of penrose tilings @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , following the algebraic approach of de bruijn for penrose tilings @xcite , beenker defined these tilings , that he called _",
    "grid - rhombus _ , as digitizations of parallel planes in @xmath2 , with the non - periodicity deriving from the irrationality of the slope of these planes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , beenker was unaware of the work of the amateur mathematician ammann , published only some years later @xcite , and he was unable to find notched tiles which can form only these tilings .",
    "instead , he introduced the notching of fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] , calling _ arrowed - rhombus _ the tilings which can be formed and proving that they strictly contain the grid - rhombus tilings .",
    "+ to conclude this short review , let us mention that ammann - beenker tilings can not be characterized by their local patterns , that is , for any @xmath3 , there exists a tiling whose patterns of radius @xmath4 all appear in an ammann - beenker tiling but which is not itself an ammann - beenker tiling @xcite .",
    "suitable notchings of tiles must thus carry some information over arbitrarily long distances !",
    "let @xmath5 be pairwise non - colinear unitary vector of the euclidean plane .",
    "we define the six rhombi @xmath6 , for @xmath7 , and we call _ octogonal tiling _ any covering of the euclidean plane by translated rhombi , where rhombi can intersect only on a vertex or along a complete edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tilings ] ) .",
    "+ let @xmath8 be the canonical basis of @xmath2 .",
    "a _ lift _ of an octogonal tiling is obtained by mapping its rhombi onto faces of unit hypercubes @xmath9 so that any two rhombi adjacent along @xmath10 are mapped onto unit faces adjacent along @xmath11 .",
    "this is a two - dimensional surface of @xmath2 which is uniquely defined up to translation .",
    "+ an octogonal tiling is said to be _ planar _ if there are a two - dimensional plane @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that it can be lifted into the `` slice '' @xmath14 ^ 4 $ ] .",
    "the plane @xmath15 is called its _",
    "slope _ and the smallest suitable @xmath16 its _ thickness _ ( both are unique ) . a planar",
    "octogonal tiling can be seen as a digitization of its slope .",
    "+ for example , the ammann - beenker tilings are the planar octogonal tilings of thickness one whose slope is generated by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . + planar octogonal tilings form a subclass of the so - called _",
    "projection tilings_. those of thickness one are periodic for a rational slope , _ quasiperiodic _ otherwise , _",
    "i.e. _ , any pattern of radius @xmath4 which appears somewhere in a tiling reappears in this tiling at a distance uniformly bounded in @xmath4 .",
    "this perfect order weakens when the thickness increases , but the long range order nevertheless persists .",
    "the _ @xmath19-th shadow _ of an octogonal tiling is the orthogonal projection of its lift along @xmath11 .",
    "formally , a @xmath19-th shadow is a lift of an octogonal tiling , _",
    "i.e. _ , a two - dimensional surface of @xmath2 , but since it does not contain unit faces with the edge @xmath11 , it can be convenient to see it as a two - dimensional surface of @xmath20 . +",
    "a _ period _ of a shadow is a translation vector leaving invariant the shadow .",
    "the _ subperiods _ of an octogonal tilings are the periods of its shadows .",
    "[ fig : shadows ] depicts the fourth shadows of the tilings of fig .",
    "[ fig : tilings ] : they are periodic .",
    "actually , the alternation of rhombus orientations in these tilings , discussed in the introduction , precisely enforces a period for each shadow .",
    "formally , one checks that with @xmath21 ( complex notation ) for @xmath22 , the @xmath19-th shadow of any such tiling admits the period @xmath23 defined by @xmath24    .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=31.0% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=31.0% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=31.0% ]",
    "first , recall ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , chap .",
    "7 ) that a two - dimensional plane @xmath15 of @xmath2 generated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 has for _ grassmann coordinates _ the numbers @xmath27 , @xmath7 .",
    "theses coordinates are unique up to a common multiplicative constant ; one writes @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , any @xmath29 s not all equal to zero are the grassmann coordinates of some two - dimensional plane of @xmath2 if and only if they satisfy the _ plcker relation _",
    "@xmath30    then , it is not hard to see that if the @xmath31-th shadow of a planar octogonal tiling of slope @xmath15 admits a period @xmath32 , then the grassmann coordinates satisfy @xmath33 where @xmath34 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath15 is generated by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the @xmath31-th shadow can be seen as a digitization of the plane of @xmath20 generated by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath32 is a period of this plane , it belongs to this plane and thus has a zero dot product with the normal vector @xmath37 .",
    "+ one can also use shadows to show that in any planar octogonal tiling of slope @xmath15 , the ratio between the proportions of tiles with edges @xmath38 and @xmath39 and those with edges @xmath10 and @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "+ now , consider a tiling by tiles of fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] : it is octogonal up to the notching .",
    "if we assume that it is planar , then its subperiods yield @xmath42 and plugging this into the plcker relation , a short computation shows that the slope must be one of the planes @xmath43 conversely , any planar octogonal tiling with one of these slopes and thickness one satisfies the alternation of rhombi orientations ( two rhombi with the same orientation would not fit into the slice ) , thus can be tiled by the tiles of fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] .",
    "+ for example , the tilings of fig .",
    "[ fig : tilings ] have respective slope @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the latter case , which is an ammann - beenker tiling ,",
    "there is thus @xmath47 rhombi for each square ( since the square area is @xmath47 times the rhombus area , each tile covers exactly half of the plane ) .",
    "tilings by squares only have slope @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "+ however , nothing yet ensures that tilings by fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] tiles are indeed planar !",
    "[ lem : planarity ] fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] tiles form only planar tilings of uniformly bounded thickness .",
    "let @xmath50 .",
    "one checks that the orthogonal projection of the @xmath51 s onto @xmath15 are pairwise non - colinear vectors .",
    "let us identify @xmath15 with the two - dimensional euclidean plane and the above projections ( up to rescaling ) with the @xmath38 s which define the tiles , so that the orthogonal projection onto @xmath15 is a homeomorphism from any lift of any tiling of the euclidean plane by these tiles onto @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath52 be such a tiling and @xmath53 be a lift of it .",
    "define @xmath54 those are pairwise non - colinear vectors of @xmath15 .",
    "let also @xmath55 be obtained by changing @xmath47 in @xmath56 in @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath55 s are pairwise non - colinear vectors of @xmath58 .",
    "one checks that @xmath15 and @xmath59 are orthogonal planes , so that there exist two real functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 defined on @xmath15 such that the lift @xmath53 is the image of @xmath15 under @xmath62 let us show that the subperiods of @xmath52 enforce the map @xmath63 to be almost linear .",
    "let @xmath64 denotes the orthogonal projection along @xmath51 .",
    "one has @xmath65 . for any @xmath66 ,",
    "the plane @xmath67 intersects the shadow @xmath68 along the curve @xmath69 since both @xmath68 and @xmath67 are @xmath70-periodic , so is @xmath71 . in particular",
    ", it stays at bounded distance from some line directed by @xmath70 . for @xmath72 , since @xmath73 , this ensures that @xmath74 is uniformly bounded . in other words , @xmath61 has bounded fluctuations in the direction @xmath75 . similarly , for @xmath76 , @xmath77 yields that @xmath60 has bounded fluctuations in the direction @xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    ", one computes @xmath80 what yields bounded fluctuations for @xmath81 in the direction @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath75 and @xmath78 form a basis of @xmath15 , let @xmath83 stand for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and write @xmath86 if the difference of two functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 is uniformly bounded .",
    "the bounded fluctuations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the directions @xmath75 and @xmath78 yield the existence of real functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 . further , since @xmath91 , the bounded fluctuations of @xmath81 in the direction @xmath82 yield the existence of a real function @xmath92 such that @xmath93 . thus @xmath94 fix @xmath95 to get @xmath96 .",
    "fix @xmath97 to get @xmath98 .",
    "hence @xmath99 from this easily follows that @xmath92 , hence @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath63 , are linear ( up to bounded fluctuations ) .",
    "the tiling @xmath52 is thus planar .",
    "the thickness ( _ i.e. _ , the fluctuations of @xmath63 ) is uniformly bounded because the lifts are lipschitz with a constant which depends only on @xmath15 .",
    "the following theorem summarizes the results obtained in the sections [ sec : algebra ] and [ sec : planarity ] :      moreover , the ammann - beenker tilings have the slope which maximizes the area covered by rhombi : they provide the cheapest way to tile your bathroom !",
    "let us make some final comments .",
    "first , although we only prove that the thickness of tilings by fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] tiles is uniformly bounded , we conjecture that the thickness is one , so that exactly all these tilings can be formed .",
    "second , note that among the tilings by fig .",
    "[ fig : tiles ] tiles , ammann - beenker tilings are exactly ( up to the thickness ) those whose slope satisfies the relation @xmath101 , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the squares appear with the same frequency in their two possible orientations . the above mentionned result of @xcite shows that this relation , although simple , can not be enforced by local patterns : when @xmath16 tends towards @xmath47 , the tilings of slope @xmath102 and @xmath46 ( and thickness one ) become locally indistinguishable .",
    "last , let us stress that , to our knowledge , this is the first example of a finite set of tiles which can form only planar tilings with infinitely many different slopes .        f.  p.",
