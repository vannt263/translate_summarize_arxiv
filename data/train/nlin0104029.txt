    "the transition from _ phase _ to _ defect chaos _ for the one dimensional complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) was recently related to the bifurcation properties of a family of coherent structures called _ modulated amplitude waves _ ( maws ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "the relationship between maws and large scale chaos is studied in detail , providing a comprehensive description of various aspects of the cgle chaotic dynamics .    when a spatially extended system is driven sufficiently far away from equilibrium",
    ", patterns can eventually form  @xcite .",
    "in many cases these patterns show an erratic behavior in space and time : such behavior is commonly referred to as _ spatiotemporal chaos _  @xcite .",
    "examples of extended systems displaying such chaotic dynamics in one spatial dimension include : heated wire convection  @xcite , printers instability and film drag experiments  @xcite , eutectic growth  @xcite , binary convection  @xcite , sidewall convection  @xcite , the far field of spiral waves in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction  @xcite , the taylor - dean system  @xcite , hydrothermal  @xcite and internal  @xcite waves excited by the marangoni effect and the oscillatory instability of a rayleigh - bnard convection pattern  @xcite .",
    "near the pattern forming threshold , the dynamics of such systems can often be described by so - called amplitude equations .",
    "when the pattern forming bifurcation from the homogeneous state is a forward hopf bifurcation , the appropriate amplitude equation is the cgle @xcite , which in one spatial dimension reads as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are real coefficients and the field @xmath7 has complex values",
    ".    for different choices of the coefficients numerical investigations of the cgle have revealed the existence of various steady and spatiotemporally chaotic states @xcite .",
    "many of these states appear to consist of individual structures with well defined propagation and interaction properties .",
    "it is thus tempting to use these structures as building blocks for a better understanding of spatiotemporal chaos . in this paper we will essentially follow such an approach .    as a function of the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", the cgle ( [ cgle ] ) can exhibit two qualitatively different spatiotemporal chaotic states known as phase chaos ( when the modulus @xmath8 is at any time bounded away from zero ) and defect chaos ( when @xmath8 can vanish leading to phase singularities ) .",
    "it is under dispute whether the transition from phase to defect chaos is sharp or not , and if a pure phase - chaotic , ( _ i.e. , _ defect - free ) state can persist in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we will address these issues by suggesting a _ mechanism _ for the formation of defects related to the range of existence of maws .",
    "= 1.2    = .6    the main points of this paper are outlined in the following and illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig0],[fig1 ] . _",
    "( i ) _ our investigation starts with the study of maws , which are uniformly propagating , spatially periodic solutions of the cgle .",
    "these maws are parameterized by the average phase gradient @xmath9 and their spatial period @xmath0 .",
    "our study is confined to the case @xmath10 for reasons specified below .",
    "spatial profiles and the stable propagation of a particular maw are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig0]a - c .",
    "isolated maw structures consisting of just one spatial period @xmath0 play an important role in defect formation . in particular , for fixed cgle coefficients the range of existence of coherent maws is limited by a saddle - node ( @xmath11 ) bifurcation which occurs when @xmath0 reaches a maximal period @xmath1 . _",
    "( ii ) _ if the maws are driven into conditions with @xmath12 a dynamical instability occurs leading to the formation of defects ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]d ) . _",
    "( iii ) _ slowly evolving structures reminiscent of maws ( `` near - maws '' ) are observed in the phase chaotic regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]e , f ) . in order to characterize such states ,",
    "we have examined the distribution @xmath13 of spacings @xmath3 between neighboring peaks of the phase - gradient profile .",
    "in particular for sufficiently long spacing @xmath3 , the observed phase chaos structures are often very similar to a single period of a coherent maw ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]f ) . _",
    "( iv ) _ when a phase chaotic state displays spacings @xmath3 larger than @xmath1 , phase chaos breaks down and defects are formed ( _ e.g. _ at @xmath14 in fig .  [ fig0]i ) .",
    "thus , the maw with @xmath15 may be viewed as a `` critical nucleus '' for the creation of defects . in phase chaos defect formation",
    "is similar to the dynamical process by which isolated maw structures generate defects ( fig .  [",
    "therefore purely phase chaotic states are those for which @xmath3 remains bounded below @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]g ) , while defect chaos can occur when @xmath3 becomes larger than @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]i ) . _",
    "( v ) _ a more detailed study of the probability distribution of the @xmath3 s shows that for large @xmath3 the probability decays exponentially ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]h , j ) .",
    "as long as @xmath1 has a finite value , we expect that , possibly after a very long transient time , defects will be generated .",
    "_ ( vi ) _ however , in a finite domain of the phase chaotic region , maws of arbitrarily large @xmath0 exist : we expect that in this region , even in the thermodynamic limit , phase chaos will persist .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the main quadrant of the cgle coefficient space .",
    "the region of persistent phase chaos is bounded by the benjamin - feir - newell curve ( thin dot - dashed ) and the curve along which @xmath16 ( full curve in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : section [ seccs ] is devoted to the study of the coherent maw structures . in section [ sbif ]",
    "we study the bifurcation diagram of the maws , starting from the homogeneous oscillation . in section [ sdef ]",
    "the incoherent dynamics of near - maw structures is presented .",
    "we show that for @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. , _ beyond the saddle - node bifurcation , near - maws evolve to defects . to illustrate the origin of the saddle - node bifurcations in section [ break ] we compare bifurcation diagrams of coherent structures for different phase gradient expansions of the cgle . for the lowest order expansion ( known as the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation @xcite ) the saddle - node bifurcation is absent while it is captured by expansions of higher order .",
    "this explains why the divergence of the phase gradient was exclusively observed in simulations @xcite of higher order expansions . in section [ seclsc ]",
    "we study various aspects of spatiotemporal chaos in the cgle , and relate the observed continuous ( @xmath18 ) and discontinuous ( @xmath19 ) transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) to properties of the maws . _",
    "the transition to defect chaos takes place when near - maws with periods larger than @xmath1 occur in a phase chaotic state_. in section [ mec ] the typical values of @xmath3 in the phase chaotic regime are related to the competition of two instabilities of the maws , and it is possible to give a good estimate for the numerically measured transition from phase to defect chaos from these considerations .",
    "a discussion of the presented results and some final remarks are reported in section [ conclu ] .",
    "in this section we study the main properties of modulated amplitude waves ( maws ) @xcite .",
    "first , in section [ scoh ] the coherent structure framework that we use to describe the maws is introduced .",
    "the bifurcation diagram of maws is explored in section [ sbif ] , with a particular focus on the saddle - node bifurcations that limit the range of existence of maws . in section [ sdef ]",
    "we study the nonlinear evolution of near - maws that are `` pushed '' beyond their saddle - node bifurcation and show that this leads to the formation of defects .",
    "finally , in section [ break ] a bifurcation analysis of maw - like coherent structures is performed in various _",
    "phase equations _ that have been proposed as approximated models for the phase chaotic dynamics of the cgle , and we show that only higher order phase equations reproduce the saddle - node bifurcation .    [ tbph ] = .7      _ coherent _ structures in the cgle are uniformly propagating structures of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real - valued functions of @xmath23 .",
    "coherent structures have been studied extensively @xcite and play an important role in various regimes of the cgle @xcite .",
    "the restriction to uniformly propagating structures reduces the cgle to a set of three coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xcite .",
    "these odes are readily found by substitution of ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) into the cgle  ( [ cgle ] ) and read as : @xmath24 \\label{ode } \\\\",
    "\\psi_z & = & -2b\\psi / a+ \\gamma^{-1 } [ c_1+\\omega+v(c_1b / a-\\psi)-(c_1+c_3 ) a^2 ] ~ ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "solutions of the odes  ( [ ode ] ) correspond to coherent structures of the cgle .",
    "the simplest relevant solutions of these odes are the fixed points given by @xmath28 ; these correspond to plane wave solutions of the cgle where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "an example of more complex solutions of the odes ( [ ode ] ) are heteroclinic orbits which correspond to coherent structures that asymptotically connect different states .",
    "examples of such structures are fronts that connect nonlinear plane waves to the homogeneous state @xmath31 @xcite and nozaki - bekki holes that connect plane waves of different wavenumber @xmath32 @xcite .    here",
    "we present an extensive study of the structures that are associated with the _ limit cycles _ of the odes ( [ ode ] ) @xcite .",
    "these limit cycles correspond to spatially periodic solutions of the cgle that we have already referred to as maws ( fig .  [ orbits ] ) . for appropriate choices of @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", the period @xmath0 of these maws can be made arbitrarily large , and in this limit the limit cycles approach a homoclinic orbit connecting the stable and unstable manifold of one of the plane wave fixed points ( fig .",
    "[ orbits]a ) .",
    "some of these infinite period maws have also been referred to as `` homoclinic '' holes , and have been studied extensively recently @xcite ; they are qualitatively different from the well - known nozaki - bekki holes @xcite",
    ".    even if the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fixed , maws are not uniquely determined .",
    "counting arguments , similar to those developed in @xcite , yield that in general we may expect a two - parameter family of solutions . let us first perform the counting for the homoclinic orbits . as shown in @xcite , these orbits connect the one - dimensional unstable manifold of a fixed point with its two - dimensional stable manifold . in general , one needs to satisfy one condition to make such a connection , in other words , such a homoclinic orbit is of codimension one . since the coherent structure ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) has two freely adjustable parameters ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , we therefore expect a one parameter family of homoclinic orbits .",
    "the situation for the limit cycles of the odes is even simpler .",
    "limit cycles are of codimension zero in parameter space , and so we expect a two parameter family of limit cycles . in other words , if we have found a limit cycle for certain values of @xmath34 and @xmath33 , then we expect this limit cycle to persist for nearby values of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath33 .    obviously , we can parameterize this family of limit cycle coherent structures by @xmath34 and @xmath33 , but this is not very insightful .",
    "instead we will use the following two quantities that are more directly accessible in studies of the cgle : the spatial period @xmath0 of the maws , and their average phase gradient @xmath35 . note that for homoclinic holes",
    ", @xmath0 simply goes to infinity ; thus homoclinic orbits and limit cycles are members of a single family",
    ".    the multiplicity of the maws can also be obtained by considering the instability of the plane wave solutions from which the maws emerge @xcite ( see section [ sbif ] below ) .",
    "the plane waves form a one - parameter ( @xmath32 ) family and undergo the well - known eckhaus instability when the coefficients @xmath36 are increased beyond certain critical values which depend on @xmath32 . in the unstable regime ,",
    "a plane wave with wavenumber @xmath32 is unstable to a whole band of perturbations with wavenumbers @xmath37 $ ] @xcite . for finite systems of size",
    "@xmath38 , this instability thus only appears when @xmath39 .",
    "therefore for each @xmath32 there is a unique one - parameter ( @xmath38 ) family of perturbations that can render the plane wave unstable and at each of the corresponding bifurcations a new maw solution emerges .",
    "hence also by this line of reasoning maws form a two - parameter family .",
    "= .7    the general counting arguments given in the previous section do not provide information on the range of existence of maws as a function of the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath0 . here",
    "we will focus our analysis on the @xmath40 case since this is most relevant for the transition to defect chaos @xcite ; the @xmath41 case will be treated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "all bifurcation computations have been performed with the aid of the software package auto94 @xcite .",
    "auto94 can trace maw solutions through parameter space , and when it detects bifurcations it can follow the newly emerging branches . auto94 discretizes the odes ( [ ode ] ) on a periodic domain of length @xmath38 , and @xmath38 will play the role of the period @xmath0 of the maws .",
    "control of the average phase gradient @xmath42 is implemented via the integral constraint @xmath43 .",
    "since periodic boundary conditions result in translational invariance , we introduce an additional `` pinning '' condition @xmath44 in order to obtain unique solutions .",
    "under these conditions , the continuation procedure works as follows .",
    "first of all , @xmath9 and @xmath0 are set to fixed values , and throughout this paper we will set @xmath45 . starting from a known solution such as a plane wave or a coherent structure obtained by other means , auto94 is set up to trace the maws along trajectories in @xmath5 , @xmath6 space , while calculating the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 of these maws .",
    "the results of our bifurcation analysis are summarized in fig .",
    "[ tmpfig1 ] . when @xmath5 or @xmath6 is increased , the uniformly oscillating state of the cgle ( @xmath46 ) becomes unstable via a hopf bifurcation , from which stationary maws emerge ( section [ sshopf ] ) .",
    "these stationary , left - right symmetric solutions undergo a drift pitchfork bifurcation , which leads to left and right traveling maws ( section [ ssdrift ] , see also fig .  [ tmpfig1]b ) ; as discussed later , these are the solutions relevant for the dynamics in the phase chaotic regime . following these branches of traveling maws , we encounter a saddle - node bifurcation where an `` upper '' and `` lower '' branch of maws merge ( section [ sssn ] , see also fig .  [ bif3 ] ) ; this bifurcation limits the range of existence of maws and is closely related to the formation of defects .",
    "the upper branch maws can be continued back to negative values of @xmath5 , where they terminate in a solution consisting of a periodic array of shocks and stationary nozaki - bekki holes @xcite .",
    "upper branch maws with @xmath47 have been studied under the name homoclinic holes @xcite .",

    "if the average phase gradient locally ( on scales @xmath0 ) deviates from @xmath69 then the saddle - node bifurcation slightly shifts towards smaller coefficients @xcite .",
    "as far as the ( numerically ) improved @xmath19 and @xmath18 lines are concerned , we observe that both these lines lie to the left of the ones determined in earlier numerical studies @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that our simulations are of longer duration then those performed previously .",

    "we can not exclude such a possibility for higher space dimensions , but based on the results presented in this paper we conjecture that the saddle - node line for @xmath145 provides a lower boundary for the transition from phase to defect chaos in the one - dimensional cgle .",
    "_ final remarks - _ we have presented a systematic study of modulated amplitude waves ( maws ) in the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) .",

    "this scenario is valid for both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 transition .",

    "considerations of the linear stability properties of maws in light of their tendency to increase or decrease the typical period @xmath3 in phase chaos , has led us to a fit - free estimate of the apparent transition from phase to defect chaos that fits the numerical data well .",

    ", our analysis shows that there is no collective behavior that drives the transition . instead ,",
    "strictly local fluctuations drive local structures beyond their saddle - node bifurcation and create defects .",
    "_ outlook - _ we want to stress here that the extension of the analysis to maws with nonzero average phase gradients  @xcite , will be of considerable interest for experimentalists , because in some recent experiments concerning rayleigh - bnard or marangoni convection in quasi - one - dimensional geometries , supercritical eckhaus instabilities of plane wave trains and the corresponding emergence of stable saturated maws have been observed @xcite .",
    "these states are analogous to what happens for the 1d cgle when phase chaotic solutions with @xmath146 are considered @xcite .",
    "the relevance of maws for two - dimensional structures is suggested by recent experimental evidence of maws observed in connection with superspiral and spiral breakup occurring in a belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the phase chaotic regime of the 2d cgle the correspondence between long inter - peak spacings ( here diameter of cells ) and the strength of the local modulation has already been noticed numerically @xcite .",
