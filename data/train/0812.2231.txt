    "since the successful realization of bose - einstein condensation in a bosonic @xmath1 system  @xcite , ultracold atomic systems have attracted considerable interest .",
    "@xcite one of the most active topics in this field is an optical lattice system , @xcite which is formed by loading the ultracold atoms in a periodic potential .",
    "this provides a clean system with quantum parameters which can be tuned in a controlled fashion from weak to strong coupling limits .",
    "in fact , remarkable phenomena have been observed such as the phase transition between a mott insulator and a superfluid in bosonic systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the superfluid state  @xcite and the mott insulating state  @xcite have been observed in the fermionic optical lattices , which stimulates theoretical investigations on the quantum states in the optical lattice systems . among them , the possibilty of the supersolid state has been discussed as one of the interesting problems in optical lattice systems .",
    "the existence of the supersolid state was experimentally suggested in a bosonic @xmath2he system ,  @xcite and was theoretically discussed in the strongly correlated systems such as bosonic systems  @xcite and bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite . as for fermionic systems",
    ", it is known that a density wave ( dw ) state and an @xmath0-wave superfluid ( ssf ) state are degenerate in the half - filled attractive hubbard model on the bipartite lattice except for one dimension , @xcite which means that the supersolid state might be realizable in principle . however , the degenerate ground states are unstable against perturbations .",
    "in fact , the hole doping immediately drives the system to a genuine ssf state .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to realize the supersolid state in the homogeneous bulk system .",
    "by contrast , in the optical lattice , an additional confining potential makes the situation different . @xcite in our previous paper,@xcite we studied the attractive hubbard model on square lattice with harmonic potential to clarify that the supersolid state is indeed realized at low temperatures .",
    "however , we were not able to systematically deal with large clusters to discuss how the supersolid state depends on the particle density , the system size , etc",
    ". this might be important for experimental observations of the supersolid state in the optical lattice .    in this paper",
    ", we address this problem by combining the real - space dynamical mean - field theory ( r - dmft ) with a two - site impurity solver .",
    "we then discuss how stable the dw , ssf and supersolid states are in the optical lattice system .",
    "we also clarify the role of the confining potential in stabilizing the supersolid state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ 2 ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian and explain the detail of r - dmft and its impurity solver .",
    "we demonstrate that the supersolid state is indeed realized in a fermionic optical lattice with attractive interactions in sec . [ 3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ 4 ] , we discuss the stability of the supersolid state in large clusters .",
    "we also examine how the phase diagram depends on the particle number .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "let us consider ultracold fermionic atoms in the optical lattice with confinement , which may be described by the following attractive hubbard model , @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 annihilates ( creates ) a fermion at the @xmath5th site with spin @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath9 an attractive interaction , @xmath10 $ ] a harmonic potential and the term @xmath11 indicates that the sum is restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath12 is a distance measured from the center of the system and @xmath13 is lattice spacing . here , we define the characteristic length of the harmonic potential as @xmath14 , which satisfies the condition @xmath15 .",
    "the ground - state properties of the hubbard model on inhomogeneous lattices have theoretically been studied by various methods such as the bogoljubov - de gennes equations  @xcite , the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite , the slave - boson mean - field approach  @xcite , variational monte carlo simulations  @xcite , local density approximation.@xcite although magnetically ordered and superfluid states are described properly in these approaches , it may be difficult to describe the coexisting phase like a supersolid state in the inhomogeneous system .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group method  @xcite and the quantum monte carlo method  @xcite are efficient for one - dimensional systems , but it may be difficult to apply them to higher dimensional systems with large clusters .",
    "we here use r - dmft  @xcite , where local particle correlations are taken into account precisely . this treatment is formally exact for the homogeneous lattice model in infinite dimensions@xcite and the method has successfully been applied to some inhomogeneous correlated systems such as the surface  @xcite or the interface of the mott insulators  @xcite , the repulsive fermionic atoms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has an advantage in treating the ssf state and the dw state on an equal footing in the strong coupling regime , which allows us to discuss the supersolid state in the optical lattice .    in r - dmft , the lattice model is mapped to an effective impurity model , where local electron correlations are taken into account precisely .",
    "the lattice green function is then obtained via self - consistent conditions imposed on the impurity problem .",
    "when one describes the superfluid state in the framework of r - dmft,@xcite the lattice green s function for the system size @xmath16 should be represented in the nambu - gorkov formalism .",
    "it is explicitly given by the @xmath17 matrix ,    @xmath18_{ij}= -t\\delta_{\\langle ij \\rangle}\\hat{\\sigma}_z + \\delta_{ij}\\left [ i\\omega_n \\hat{\\sigma}_0   + \\left\\{\\mu - v\\left ( r_i\\right ) \\right\\}\\hat{\\sigma}_z   -\\hat{\\sigma}_i\\left(i\\omega_n\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eq : lat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the @xmath20th component of the @xmath21 pauli matrix , @xmath22 the identity matrix , @xmath23 the chemical potential , @xmath24 the matsubara frequency , and @xmath25 the temperature .",
    "the site - diagonal self - energy at @xmath5th site is given by the following @xmath21 matrix , @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] is the normal ( anomalous ) part of the self - energy .",
    "in r - dmft , the self - energy at the @xmath5th site is obtained by solving the effective impurity model , which is explicitly given by the following anderson hamiltonian , @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 annihilates ( creates ) a fermion with spin @xmath6 in the effective bath and @xmath30 is the impurity level .",
    "we have here introduced the effective parameters in the impurity model such as the spectrum of host particles @xmath31 , the pair potential @xmath32 and the hybridization @xmath33 . by solving the effective impurity model eq .",
    "( [ eq : imp ] ) for each site , we obtain the site - diagonal self - energy and the local green s function .",
    "the r - dmft self - consistent loop of calculations is iterated under the condition that the site - diagonal component of the lattice green s function is equal to the local green s function obtained from the effective impurity model as @xmath34_{ii } = \\hat{g}_{imp , i}\\left(i\\omega_n\\right)$ ] .    when r - dmft is applied to our inhomogeneous system",
    ", it is necessary to solve the effective impurity models @xmath16 times by iteration .",
    "therefore , numerically powerful methods such as quantum monte carlo simulations , the exact diagonalization method , and the numerical renormalization group method may not be efficient since they require long time to perform r - dmft calculations . in this paper",
    ", we use a two - site approximation  @xcite , where the effective bath is replaced by only one site . in spite of this simplicity",
    ", it has an advantage in taking into account both low- and high - energy properties reasonably well within restricted numerical resources  @xcite .    in the two - site approximation , a non - interacting green s function for the impurity model at the @xmath5th site",

    "this density relates the systems with different sites , number of particles , and curvatures of the confining potentials in the same way as the particle density does for periodic systems with different sites .",

    "that @xmath48 represents the order parameter for the ssf state for the @xmath5th site .    in the following , we consider the attractive hubbard model on square lattice with harmonic confinement as a simple model for the supersolid . in this case , it is known that the symmetry of the square lattice is not broken in the dw , ssf , and supersolid states  @xcite . therefore , the point group @xmath49 is useful to deal with the system on the inhomogeneous lattice .",
    "for example , when the system with 5513 sites @xmath50 is treated , one can deal with only 725 inequivalent sites .",
    "this allows us to discuss the low temperature properties in larger clusters , in comparison with those with @xmath51 treated in our previous paper .",

    "further increase in the interaction @xmath59 leads to different behavior , where the pair potential @xmath48 is induced in the region with @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the ssf state is induced by the attractive interaction , which is consistent with the results obtained from the bogoljubov - de gennes equation  @xcite . in the case with @xmath62 , another remarkable feature is found around the center of the harmonic potential @xmath63 , where a checkerboard structure appears in the density profile @xmath64 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "this implies that the dw state is realized in the region . on the other hand ,",
    "the pair potential @xmath48 is not suppressed completely even in the dw region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( c ) .",
    "this suggests that the dw state coexists with the ssf state , _",
    "i.e. _ _ a supersolid state _ appears in our optical lattice system .",
    "the profile characteristic of the supersolid state is clearly seen in the case of @xmath65 .",
    "figures [ fig : fig1](d ) and [ fig : fig2](d ) show that the dw state of checkerboard structure coexists with the ssf state in the doughnut - like region @xmath66 .",
    "by contrast , the genuine ssf state appears inside and outside of the region @xmath67 .",
    "further increase in the interaction excludes the dw state out of the center since fermionic atoms are concentrated around the bottom of the potential for large @xmath59 . in the region ,",
    "two particles with opposite spins are strongly coupled by the attractive interaction to form a hard - core boson , giving rise to the band insulator with @xmath68 , instead of the ssf state .",
    "therefore , the ssf state survives only in the narrow circular region surrounded among the empty and fully occupied states .",
    "we see such behavior more clearly in figs .",

    "we have studied the attractive hubbard model with the harmonic potential to clarify that the supersolid state is realized in a certain parameter region .",
    "however , it is not clear how the supersolid state depends on the system size and the number of particles . to make this point clear",
    ", we deal with large clusters to clarify that the supersolid state is indeed realized in the following .",
    "in this section , we discuss the stability of the supersolid state in fermionic optical lattice systems , which may be important for experimental observations .",
    "first , we clarify how low - temperature properties depend on the system size , by performing r - dmft for several clusters with different @xmath71 .",
    "we here fix @xmath65 and @xmath72 to obtain the profiles of the local particle density and the pair potential , which are shown in fig .",

    "we note that the distance @xmath76 is normalized by @xmath71 in the figure .",
    "it is found that @xmath77 and @xmath48 describe smooth curves for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where the genuine ssf state is realized . on the other hand , for @xmath80 , two distinct magnitudes appear in @xmath77 , reflecting the fact that the dw state with two sublattices is realized . since the pair potential is also finite in the region , the supersolid state is realized . in this case",
    ", we deal with finite systems , and thereby all data are discrete in @xmath76 .",
    "nevertheless , it is found that the obtained results are well scaled by @xmath71 although some fluctuations appear due to finite - size effects in the small @xmath71 case .",
    "the effective particle density @xmath81 is almost constant in the above cases .",
    "therefore , we conclude that when @xmath82 , the supersolid state discussed here is stable in the limit with @xmath83 . this result does not imply that the supersolid state is realized in the homogeneous system with arbitrary fillings .",
    "in fact , the supersolid state might be realizable only at half filling  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can say that a confining potential is essential to stabilize the supersolid state in the optical lattice system .",
    "next , we focus on the system with @xmath65 and @xmath52 to discuss in detail how the supersolid state depends on the effective particle density @xmath81 .",
    "the dw state is characterized by the checkerboard structure in the density profile @xmath64 , so that the fourier transform @xmath84 at @xmath85 is appropriate to characterize the existence of the dw state . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourier transform @xmath86 at @xmath87 may represent the rigidity of the ssf state in the system .     and @xmath88 as a function of the effective particle density @xmath89 when @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "[ fig : rho ] , we show the semilog plots of the parameters normalized by @xmath92 .",
    "it is found that the normalized parameter @xmath93 is always finite although the increase in the attractive interaction monotonically decreases it .",
    "this implies that the ssf state appears in the system with the arbitrary particle number .",
    "in contrast to this ssf state , the dw state is sensitive to the effective particle density as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] . these may be explained by the fact that in the system without a harmonic confinement @xmath94 , the dw state is realized only at half filling @xmath95 , while the ssf state is always realized . to clarify this",
    ", we also show the local particle density in the noninteracting case at the center of the system as the broken line in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] .",
    "it is found that when the quantity approaches half - filling @xmath96 , @xmath97 takes its maximum value , where the ssf state coexists with the dw state .",
    "therefore , we can say that the supersolid state is stable around this condition . increasing the effective particle density , the band insulating states become spread around the center , while the dw and ssf states should be realized in a certain circular region surrounded among the empty and fully - occupied regions .",
    "therefore , the normalized parameters @xmath98 and @xmath93 are decreased with increase in @xmath81 . on the other hand , in the case with low density @xmath99 ,",
    "the local particle density @xmath100 at each site is far from half filling even when @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the dw state does not appear in the system , but the genuine ssf state is realized .",
    "these facts imply that the condition @xmath101 is still important to stabilize the supersolid state even in fermionic systems confined by a harmonic potential.@xcite    by performing similar calculations for the systems with low , intermediate , and high particle densities ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) , we end up with the phase diagrams , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] .     and",
    "the density plot represents the profiles of the @xmath0-wave pair potential as a function of the attractive interaction @xmath104 .",
    "the dw state is realized in the shaded area .",
    "the broken lines give a guide to eyes which distinguishes the region with a fractional particle density from the empty and fully - occupied regions .",
    ", width=264 ]    we find that increasing the attractive interaction , fermionic particles gradually gather around the center of the system , where the empty state is stabilized away from the center and the band insulating state with fully occupied sites is stabilized .",
    "it is found that the region surrounded among these states strongly depend on the effective particle density @xmath81 .",
    "the increase in the effective particle density shrinks the region , which affects the stability of the ssf , dw and their coexisting states .",
    "in particular , the dw region , which is shown as the shaded area in fig . [",
    "fig : phases ] , is sensitive to the effective particle density , as discussed above .",
    "namely , the local pair potential @xmath48 takes its maximum value around @xmath105 , which may give a rough guide for the crossover region between the bcs - type and the bec - type states .",
    "we note that the dw state appears only in the bcs region @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that the condition @xmath107 is not sufficient , but necessary to stabilize the supersolid state in the attractive hubbard model with an inhomogeneous potential .",
    "we wish to comment on the conditions to observe the supersolid state in the fermionic optical lattice system .",
    "needless to say , one of the most important conditions is the low temperature.@xcite second is the tuning of the effective particle density @xmath108 , which depends on the curvature of the harmonic potential as well as the total number of particles .",
    "this implies that a confined potential play a crucial role in stabilizing the supersolid state in fermionic optical lattice systems .",
    "in addition to this , an appropriate attractive interaction is necessary to stabilize the dw state in the bcs - type ssf state .",
    "when these conditions are satisfied , the supersolid state is expected to be realized at low temperatures .",
    "we have investigated the fermionic attractive hubbard model in the optical lattice with harmonic confinement . by combining r - dmft with a two - site impurity solver",
    ", we have obtained the rich phase diagram on the square lattice , which has a remarkable domain structure including the ssf state in the wide parameter region . by performing systematic calculations ,",
    "we have then confirmed that the supersolid state , where the ssf state coexists with the dw state , is stabilized even in the limit with @xmath109 and @xmath110 const .",
