    "the circular chromatic number @xmath5 of a graph @xmath3 , which is a refinement of its chromatic number , has received much attention recently ( see  @xcite for a survey on recent developments ) .",
    "recall that the _ circular chromatic number _",
    "@xmath6 of a graph @xmath3 is the infimum of rational numbers @xmath7 such that there is a mapping from the vertex set of @xmath3 to @xmath8 with the property that for adjacent vertices are mapped to elements at distance @xmath9 .    in general , graphs of large girth can have arbitrary given circular chromatic number :    for any rational @xmath10 and any positive integers @xmath11 , there is a graph @xmath3 of girth at least @xmath12 such that @xmath3 has exactly @xmath13 @xmath14-colorings , up to equivalence . in particular , for any @xmath10 and for any integer @xmath12 , there is a graph @xmath3 of girth at least @xmath12 which is uniquely @xmath14-colorable and hence it has @xmath15 .",
    "however , if restricted to special classes of graphs , large girth graphs may be forced to have small circular chromatic number . for instance :    [ thm : ggh ] for any integer @xmath16 , for any @xmath17 , there is an integer @xmath18 such that every @xmath19-minor free graph @xmath3 with girth at least @xmath18 has @xmath20 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend theorem  [ thm : ggh ] to other classes , all with a bounded expansion .",
    "classes with bounded expansion have been introduced in @xcite , and are based on the requirement for the graph invariant @xmath21 to be bounded in the class for each @xmath14 .",
    "denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the vertex set and the edge set of @xmath3 .",
    "also denote by @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) the _ order _ of @xmath3 ( resp . _",
    "let @xmath26 be graphs with @xmath27 and let @xmath14 be an integer .",
    "a graph @xmath28 is a _ shallow minor _ of a graph @xmath3 _ at depth _",
    "@xmath14 , if there exists disjoint subsets @xmath29 of @xmath22 such that    * the subgraph of @xmath3 induced by @xmath30 is connected and as radius at most @xmath14 , * if @xmath31 is adjacent to @xmath32 in @xmath28 , then some vertex in @xmath30 is adjacent in @xmath3 to some vertex in @xmath33 .",
    "we denote @xcite by @xmath34 the class of the ( simple ) graphs which are shallow minors of @xmath3 at depth @xmath14 , and we denote by @xmath21 the maximum density of a graph in @xmath34 , that is : @xmath35 the _ expansion _ of a class @xmath36 is the function @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 a class @xmath36 has _",
    "bounded expansion _ if @xmath39 for each value of @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , the class @xmath40 of all graphs with maximum degree @xmath41 has @xmath42 , while a class @xmath43 has uniformly bounded @xmath44 ( that is : @xmath45 for some constant @xmath46 , independently of @xmath14 ) if and only if there is a graph @xmath47 that is a minor of no graph in @xmath36 .",
    "the expansion function @xmath44 is indeed non - decreasing and no other general constraint exists on the grow rate of expansion functions . in particular , for every non - decreasing function @xmath48 with @xmath49 there exists a class @xmath43 with @xmath50 ( see @xcite , exercice 5.1 ) .",
    "however , when studying properties of a class , it is sometimes the case that the frontier between classes that verify the property and those that do not can be ( at least approximately ) expressed by means of a threshold expansion function ( see for instance  @xcite , where it is proved that every class @xmath43 with expansion @xmath51 is small , but that some non - small class @xmath36 exists , for which @xmath52 ) .",
    "in such a setting , theorem  [ thm : ggh ] can be restated as the fact that if @xmath45 ( for some constant @xmath46 ) then for any @xmath17 , there is an integer @xmath18 such that every @xmath53 with girth at least @xmath18 has @xmath20 .",
    "however , such a statement can not be extended to all classes with bounded expansion , and even to all classes @xmath43 with exponential expansion : there exists @xmath41-regular graphs with arbitrary large girth and circular chromatic number at least @xmath54  @xcite , thus the class @xmath40 of all graphs with maximum degree @xmath41 ( which is such that @xmath42 ) does not have the property that large girth implies a circular chromatic number arbitrarily close to @xmath55 .    we show in this paper ( corollary  [ cor : circ ] ) that exponential expansion is indeed a threshold , in the sense that the condition @xmath56 ( as @xmath57 ) is sufficient to ensure the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : ggh ] .",
    "hence a natural problem arises , to make this threshold more precise :    [ pb : circ ] what is the maximum real integer @xmath58",
    "such that for every class @xmath36 with @xmath59 and every positive real @xmath17 there is an integer @xmath18 with the property that every graph @xmath60 with girth at least @xmath18 has @xmath20 ?",
    "it follows from @xcite and corollary  [ cor : circ ] that @xmath61 , and we conjecture @xmath62",
    ".    other application of our approach are theorem  [ thm : orient1 ] , which concerns the oriented chromatic number and which is the subject of section  [ sec : circ ] , and theorem  [ thm : chip],.which concerns the @xmath1th chromatic number @xmath2 and which is the subject of section  [ sec : chip ] .",
    "one of the main tools used to address homomorphism properties of graphs ( or directed graphs ) with high - girth is the notion of path - degeneracy ( see for instance @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath3 is _ @xmath1-path degenerate _ if there is a sequence @xmath63 of subgraphs of @xmath3 such that @xmath64 is a forest , and each @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is obtained from @xmath67 by deleting the internal vertices of a path of length at least @xmath1 , all of degree two",
    ".    we shall relate path - degeneracy of large girth graphs in a class @xmath36 to expansion properties of the class @xmath43 .",
    "first we recall a result that will needed for the proof .",
    "[ thm : dr ] let @xmath68 be an integer and let @xmath3 be a graph .",

    "our proof follows similar lines as the proof ( @xcite , lemma  2.5 ) .",
    "assume for contradiction that @xmath36 include graphs with girth at least @xmath18 that are not @xmath1-path degenerate , and let @xmath3 be a minimal such graph .",
    "the graph @xmath3 is @xmath55-connected , since a graph is @xmath1-path degenerate if all its blocks are .",
    "the graph @xmath3 is not a circuit since , as @xmath75 , the graph @xmath3 would be @xmath1-path degenerate .",
    "hence @xmath3 is neither an edge or a circuit .",
    "therefore , there exists a unique graph @xmath76 with minimum degree at least @xmath41 , which is homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "the graph @xmath3 can be obtained from @xmath76 by replacing each edge @xmath77 with a path @xmath78 of length at least one and at most @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath80 .",

    "if @xmath76 has girth greater than @xmath12 then @xmath82 .",
    "as @xmath83 it holds @xmath84 hence it holds @xmath85 what contradicts our assumption .",
    "we shall make use of the following property .    for every graph @xmath3 and integer @xmath86 ,",
    "the following are equivalent :    * @xmath87 * @xmath88    existence of a homomorphism to an odd cycle is also linked to path - degenacy .    [ lem : ggh ] a @xmath1-path degenerate graph @xmath3 admits a homomorphism to any odd circuit of length at most @xmath89 .",

    "the bound on the girth was reduced to @xmath100  @xcite ( where the result generalized to graphs embeddable on the torus , or the klein bottle ) and then to @xmath101  @xcite . in  @xcite , it is proved that the considered high - girth graphs not only have oriented chromatic number @xmath0 , but that every orientation of these have a homomorphism to the same @xmath0-vertex regular tournament @xmath102 .",
