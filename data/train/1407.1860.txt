    "there are two dimensionless constants , the fine - structure constant ( @xmath0 ) and the proton - electron mass ratio ( @xmath2 ) , for which spectroscopy is a test ground to probe temporal and spatial variations .",
    "the constant @xmath0 is important for electronic structure of atoms and molecules .",
    "the dependence of the spectrum on @xmath0 appears through the relativistic corrections , such as the fine - structure , lamb shift , etc .",
    "the leading relativistic corrections scale as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is atomic number .",
    "therefore , heavier elements have higher sensitivity to @xmath0-variation .",
    "for the astrophysically relevant elements @xmath5 and relativistic corrections do not exceed few percent .",
    "the constant @xmath2 enters atomic spectra only through the isotope shifts which are typically on the order of @xmath6 , or less . due to the presence of the vibrational and rotational structures ,",
    "the dependence of the molecular spectra on @xmath2 is much more pronounced .",
    "therefore , the search for @xmath0-variation is usually done using atomic spectra @xcite , while @xmath2-variation is studied with the help of molecular spectra @xcite .",
    "let us note in passing that much higher sensitivity to the variation of both fundamental constants than in optics , can be found in the infrared and microwave wavebands @xcite .",
    "astronomical differential measurements of the constant @xmath0 is based on the comparison of the line centers in the absorption or emission spectra of cosmic objects and the corresponding laboratory values .",
    "it follows that the uncertainties of the laboratory rest frequencies and of the line centers in astronomical spectra are the prime concern of such measurements .",
    "for example , the unknown isotopic abundances of the elements in the universe can lead to the systematic frequency shifts , comparable to the expected signal from @xmath0-variation @xcite .",
    "that is why it is important to use such heavy elements as fe and ni where relativistic effects are larger , while isotopic shifts are suppressed .",
    "most studies of the possible @xmath0-variation at the redshifts @xmath7 are based on the analysis of the quasar absorbtion spectra using many multiplet method suggested in refs .",
    "this method utilizes lines of different ions from the same source .",
    "all these lines are analyzed simultaneously to find the redshift and the value of @xmath0 for this object .",
    "the lines with small sensitivity coefficients to @xmath0-variation serve as anchors which give the redshift , while the lines with high sensitivity serve as probes , which give the value of @xmath0 .",
    "all lines of the light ions , like mg  ii and al  ii , belong to the first category .",
    "most lines of heavier ions , like fe  ii , ni  ii , and zn  ii , fall into second category .",
    "however , some of the lines of ni  ii have relatively small sensitivity and belong to anchors .",
    "this can be important for the control of the systematics .",
    "the lines of the ion fe  ii have sensitivity coefficients to @xmath0-variation of different signs .",
    "this also allows effective control of the possible systematic effects .    at present",
    "there is one group , that reports nonzero space - time variation of @xmath0 on the level of few parts per million ( ppm ) @xcite ( known as the `` australian dipole '' ) .",
    "these results have not been confirmed by other groups , who give only upper limits on the @xmath0-variation also at the ppm level ( see @xcite and references therein ) . because of that it is important to continue observations and include more sources and additional lines .",
    "such programs are currently going on at the vlt and keck telescopes @xcite .",
    "a list of the astrophysically relevant optical lines of atoms and ions is given in compilations @xcite .",
    "these compilations includes eleven lines of ni  ii . according to @xcite",
    "there are nine lines of ni  ii , which can be observed in the quasar spectra including one line not listed in @xcite .",
    "the rest frequencies for ni ii are tabulated in nist database @xcite .",
    "compilation by @xcite includes both frequencies and oscillator strengths @xmath8 for astrophysically relevant lines .",
    "several high accuracy laboratory rest frequencies were measured in ref.@xcite . according to @xcite more accurate laboratory measurements are needed .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0-variation ( @xmath1-factors ) was theoretically studied in refs .",
    "@xcite for four lines from the list @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do calculations of the @xmath1-factors and oscillator strengths @xmath8 for all nine astrophysically interesting lines of ni  ii .",
    "supposing that the nowadays value of @xmath0 differs from its value in the earlier universe we can study space - time variation of @xmath0 by comparing atomic frequencies for distant objects in the universe with their laboratory values . in practice , we need to find relativistic frequency shifts , known as @xmath1-factors @xcite .",
    "the difference between the transition frequencies in astrophysical spectra and the laboratory ones is given by the formula : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a transition frequency in non - relativistic approximation , @xmath11 is a relativistic correction . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory1 ] ) @xmath12 is the frequency value for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is fine - structure constant in the laboratory ( present time ) conditions .",
    "note that transition @xmath1-factor is simply a difference between @xmath1-factors of upper and lower levels .    for the search of the @xmath0-variation it is most advantageous to use atoms and ions for which @xmath1-factors of transitions between certain states significantly differ from each other .",
    "that means we need elements with high @xmath4 . at the same time",
    "these elements should be abundant in the universe to provide sufficient observational data .",
    "the latter restriction leaves us with fe and ni as the most heavy abundant elements .",

    "rough estimates of the @xmath1-factors can be obtained from a simple one - particle model @xcite .",
    "but in order to obtain more accurate values one has to account for electronic correlations and perform large - scale numerical calculations . to find @xmath1-factors numerically we need to solve the atomic relativistic eigenvalue problem for different values of @xmath0 , or equivalently for different values of @xmath15 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory1 ] ) . in this case",
    "we can get @xmath1-factor as : @xmath16 our previous experience shows that convenient choice is @xmath17 . in order to test the accuracy of this approximation we can also estimate the second derivative : @xmath18 where @xmath19",
    ".    when second derivative is small , results of the calculation using eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory2 ] ) are sufficiently reliable . if this were not the case we would have strong interaction between levels .",
    "such situation requires more carefulness",
    ". it may be useful to trace the levels to smaller values of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we do additional calculation for @xmath20 . when theoretical splitting for the interacting levels at @xmath21 is close to the experimental one , then we can expect good accuracy for the @xmath1-factors even for this case . otherwise , if the splitting at @xmath21 differs from the experiment , the @xmath1-factors calculated for @xmath21 may be incorrect .",
    "we can try to improve calculated @xmath1-factors by moving along @xmath15 axis to the point where theoretical splitting matches experiment @xcite . as an additional test of the accuracy of our theory we compare calculated @xmath22-factors with the experimental ones from @xcite .",

    "an upper component of the virtual orbitals is formed from the previous orbital of the same symmetry by multiplication with some smooth function of radial variable @xmath39 in the spherical cavity with a radius 50 a.u .",
    "the lower component is then formed using kinetic balance condition . this way we make finite basis set of 33 orbitals that include @xmath40 partial waves ( @xmath41 ) .",
