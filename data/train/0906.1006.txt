    "the draco dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy is a nearby satellite of the milky way .",
    "it was extensively studied by @xcite , who constructed a cmd and searched for variable stars .",
    "hst imaging by @xcite suggested that the bulk of the stars are old , with a luminosity function similar to that of old , metal - poor galactic globular clusters . although @xcite find a median age for draco stars of 7  gyr from hst archival images , the recent hst study by @xcite , which provides coarse age distributions for draco and several other galactic satellites , yields a somewhat older mean age for this stellar population .",
    "there is no evidence for multiple main sequences nor any sign of ongoing star formation .",
    "a very low upper limit for neutral hydrogen gas in draco was established by @xcite .",
    "many radial velocity surveys of large samples of stars have been carried out to confirm membership and measure the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of radius in draco as well as in the other milky way satellites ; @xcite is an early example of such for draco , while @xcite highlights the very large @xmath6 datasets that can be assembled today .",
    "the observed @xmath7 in draco is unexpectedly high , given the low luminosity of the system , and remains flat to large radii , which according to @xcite ( see also the references therein ) requires the presence of large amounts of dark matter .",
    "these studies generally ignore the issue of potential ongoing tidal disruption affecting the internal kinematics of the milky way satellite , which does not appear to be a concern in the case of draco @xcite .",
    "there is great current interest in the detailed properties of satellites of the galaxy in light of our greatly improved hierarchical cold dark matter cosmological models , which gave rise to the the missing satellite problem @xcite .",
    "this is only enhanced by the discovery that the dsph galaxies appear to be dark matter dominated systems , unlike globular clusters of similar total stellar mass . with the advent of efficient high dispersion spectrographs , large area ccd detectors , and 10-m class telescopes , studying stars in at least the nearer galactic satellites at high spectral dispersion",
    "has become feasible .",
    "early moderate resolution spectroscopic studies of draco by @xcite and by @xcite established the presence of an abundance spread of @xmath81  dex within draco . in this paper",
    "we present detailed abundance analyses of a sample of 8 luminous draco stars near the rgb tip , which more than doubles the sample of draco stars from the earlier work of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "our goal is understanding the chemical evolution of draco , and how this and other dsph galaxies may be related to the population of galactic halo field stars and to galactic globular clusters . the sample is presented in  [ section_param ] where the procedure for determining their stellar parameters is described .",
    "the next section describes the observations , while ",
    "[ section_analysis ] gives the details of the abundance analysis .",
    "we compare our results to those for galactic halo field stars in  [ section_field ] and introduce our toy model for abundance ratios in ",
    "[ section_toy_model ] . a comparison with the predictions of nucleosynthesis",
    "is given in ",
    "[ section_nuc ] and with chemical evolution models in  [ section_chemev ] .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of role the dsph satellite galaxies might have played the formation of the galactic halo in  [ section_discuss ] . after a brief summary",
    "we discuss in an appendix the fe - metallicity calibration for the infrared ca triplet , and compare our derived metallicities for draco giants with those inferred from cat measurements and from stromgren photometry .",
    "our sample in the draco dsph galaxy contains 8 stars ; details are given in table  [ table_sample ] .",
    "it was selected from table  2.9 of @xcite to include stars which are known radial velocity members of this satellite to the galaxy at or near the rgb tip spanning the full range in color and in metallicity and not previously observed at high spectral resolution .",
    "winnick measured the infrared ca triplet in moderate resolution spectra of draco stars obtained using the multi - fiber hydra spectrograph at the wiyn telescope .",
    "her sample was chosen from the photometric survey of @xcite and previous radial velocity surveys ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "only confirmed radial velocity members are listed in her table ; carbon stars known to be members of draco were excluded .",
    "she developed her own calibration of the relationship between ca triplet indices and fe or ca metallicity based on data for galactic globular clusters .",
    "details of the calibration and related issues are discussed in the appendix .",
    "we adopt the procedures described in @xcite and used in all subsequent work by the first author published to date to determine the stellar parameters for our sample of luminous draco giants .",
    "our @xmath9  determinations are based on the broad band colors @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the optical photometry ( we use @xmath12 only , the @xmath13 color supports the deduced @xmath9  in most cases , but is not used ) is from the sdss @xcite using the transformation equations of @xcite .",
    "the ir photometry is taken from 2mass @xcite , and is transformed from the 2mass system to the johnson - bessell system using the results of @xcite .",
    "the galactic extinction is from the map of @xcite ; e(@xmath14 ) does not exceed @xmath15  mag for any star in the draco sample .",
    "we derive surface gravities by combining these @xmath9   with an appropriate theoretical isochrone from the grid of @xcite assuming a fixed age of 12 gyr .",
    "we use the [ fe / h ] values of @xcite from the infrared ca triplet as an initial guess .",
    "we iterate as necessary given the metallicity we derive here through analysis of our high resolution spectra .",
    "we calculate the dereddened @xmath16 for each sample star ( ignoring the thickness of draco itself along the line of sight ) , adopting 76  kpc as its distance based on the rr  lyrae study in this dsph by @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath16 , which are independent of the adopted stellar parameters , to check for overall consistency with the adopted isochrones .",
    "we find the position along the rgb in the adopted isochrone appropriate for the initial estimate of metallicity for each star that has that @xmath16 and compare the corresponding @xmath9  with our adopted value inferred from the photometry for each star .",
    "the two independently determined values of @xmath9are reasonably consistent given the uncertainty in our adopted @xmath9  of 100  k. achieving this agreement is made easier since the slope of the upper rgb in the cmd is quite steep ; we find for @xmath17@xmath9   =   100  k that @xmath18   mag and @xmath17log(@xmath19)@xmath20  dex from the adopted isochrones .",
    "the resulting stellar parameters , which have been derived with no reference to the spectra themselves , are given in the second and third columns of table  [ table_param ] , as are their heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "the random uncertainties in the adopted @xmath9  from photometric errors are 100  k. this ignores systematic errors which may be present .",
    "the adopted uncertainties in log(@xmath19 )   based on the evolutionary tracks of @xcite for stars on the upper rgb are 0.25  dex .",
    "[ figure_isochrone ] shows our sample of 8 luminous giants in draco in a plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath22 corrected for interstellar reddening ; the previously studied sample of 6 giants from @xcite and by @xcite is shown as well .",

    "our hires sample of luminous draco giants was selected to span the full range in metallicity as inferred from the ca triplet indices @xcite .",
    "[ figure_isochrone ] shows it does cover the full range in @xmath21 color of the upper rgb of draco members .",
    "the luminosity of the brightest draco giants is in good agreement with that predicted from the isochrones for the rgb tip as a function of metallicity in the @xmath24 colors .",
    "the deduced ages will be described later in  [ section_age ] .",
    "the draco stars in our sample were observed with hires @xcite at the keck  i telescope during two runs , in june 2005 and in sep . 2006 .",
    "sky conditions during the 2006 run were better than in the 2005 run ; one star from the earlier run was re - observed at that time .",
    "total exposure times were two hours per star , broken up into 1800 or 2400 sec segments to expedite removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the instrument configuration yielded complete spectral coverage in a single exposure from 3810 to 6700   , and extends to 8350    with small gaps between orders .",
    "the slit width was 1.1 arcsec , which corresponds to a spectral resolution of 35,000 for all exposures .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per spectral resolution element ranges from 40 to 85 ( with 5 of the sample stars having at least 65 ) in the continuum in the central order of the spectrum ( at @xmath86050   ) , depending on the brightness of the star and the sky conditions during the exposure , most importantly on the seeing .",
    "the snr at the bluest end of these spectra is poor , only 30 to 40 per spectral resolution element .",
    "this snr calculation utilizes only poisson statistics , ignoring issues of cosmic ray removal , night sky subtraction , flattening , etc .",
    "the observations were carried out with the slit length aligned to the parallactic angle .",
    "the processing of the spectra was done with makee and figaro @xcite scripts , and follows closely that described by @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured as described in @xcite . due to the lower snr in the blue ,",
    "lines bluer than 4400  were ignored if the species had sufficient other detected lines . lines with @xmath25@xmath26  m  were discarded except for two lines from the mg triplet , the na  d lines and ba  ii lines in some of the stars ; for these key elements no or only a few weaker features could be detected in most of the stars .",
    "sometimes only one line of the na  d doublet could be measured ; the @xmath6 of some of the draco stars was such that the other component of the doublet was mangled by nad line emission from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "table  [ table_eqw ] lists the atomic parameters adopted for each line and their equivalent widths measured in the spectra of each of the draco dsph stars .",
    "the very luminous giant draco  xi-2 shows strong emission in the red wing of h@xmath2 in its spectrum , with even stronger emission seen in the blue wing .",
    "no other star in the sample shows any detectable emission in h@xmath2 .",
    "the analysis is identical to that of @xcite and earlier references therein .",
    "in particular we use the model stellar atmosphere grid of @xcite and a current version of the lte spectral synthesis program moog @xcite , which treats scattering as lte absorption .",
    "our analysis assumes classical plane parallel stellar atmospheres and lte , both for atomic and for molecular features .",
    "we adopt a solar fe abundance of log[@xmath27(fe ) ] = 7.45  dex , which is somewhat lower ( by up to 0.10  dex ) than that used by many groups .",
    "this leads directly to our [ fe / h ] values for a given star being somewhat higher and to our abundance ratios [ x / fe ] being somewhat lower than those which would be inferred by most other teams .",
    "our @xmath28 values are generally taken from version 3.1.0 of the nist atomic spectra database ( phsics.nist.gov/physrefdata/asd/index.html , nist standard reference database 78 ) .",
    "a comparison of @xmath28 values for fe we adopt with those of the first stars project at the vlt @xcite shows that the mean difference in fe transition probabilities between these us is @xmath29  dex for fe  i and 0.04 dex for fe  ii .",
    "corrections for hyperfine structure for sc  ii , v  i , mn  i , co  i , cu  i , ba  ii , and eu  ii , when necessary , were used ; the majority of the hfs patterns were adopted from @xcite .",
    "our abundances for c are from the 4320    region of the g band of ch , where the absorption is less than in the main part of the g band at 4300   .",
    "o abundances are from the forbidden line at 6300   ; sometimes the weaker 6363    line is also detected .",
    "our nominal solar c and o abundances are 8.59 and 8.83  dex respectively .",
    "we adopt a dissociation potential of 3.47  ev @xcite for ch .",
    "we have checked that with our adopted molecular parameters we can reproduce the solar spectrum of the g band of ch , taken from @xcite .",
    "the adopted solar abundances of c and of o are close to those of @xcite , but somewhat larger than the values obtained using 3d model atmospheres by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use 1d model atmospheres to synthesize the molecular features , ignoring any 3d effects , although @xcite suggest that these may be very large at [ fe / h ] @xmath30  dex , becoming less important at higher metallicities .",
    "they claim that cno abundances may be overestimated by @xmath80.8 dex as compared to a 1d analysis when molecular bands are used in extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "however , we prefer not to attempt 3d corrections until a full grid of 3d model atmospheres or of corrections to cno abundances derived from the molecular bands from 3d to 1d models becomes available .    since the draco stars are rather faint for 2mass , the uncertainties in the @xmath31 and particularly in the @xmath32 magnitudes are large .",
    "we therefore feel free to slightly adjust @xmath9  and log(@xmath19 )   after the first pass through the analysis to improve the ionization equilibrium and slope of the abundances determined from the set of fe  i lines as a function of @xmath33 ( the excitation potential of the lower level ) .",
    "these spectroscopic stellar parameters are given in the fourth and fifth column of table  [ table_param ] and are the ones used subsequently . with these values we were able to achieve good ionization equilibrium for ti and fe as well reasonable excitation equilibrium of fe  i. table  [ table_slopes ] gives the slope of a linear fit to the abundances determined from the set of fe  i lines as a function of @xmath33 , @xmath25 , and @xmath34 , which are most sensitive to @xmath9 , @xmath35 , and the wavelength dependence of any problems in establishing the correct location of the continuum ( perhaps arising from the more severe crowding towards bluer wavelengths ) or of a missing major source of continuous opacity , respectively .",
    "there are @xmath8 55 to 150 fe  i lines detected in each star , with @xmath33 ranging from 0 to @xmath84.5  ev .",
    "the only slope which is large enough to be of concern and which tends to have the most significant correlation coefficient is that with @xmath33 ( @xmath36 for some of the sample giants ) , which depends largely on @xmath9 . in our final adopted solutions , the fe  i slope as a function of @xmath33 tends to be slightly negative , with values ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38  dex / ev .",
    "however , since this slope decreases by @xmath80.2  dex / ev/(@xmath17@xmath9= 250  k ) , a decrease in @xmath9of a maximum of 125  k , consistent with our adopted @xmath9  uncertainty , would make all these slopes zero , and would decrease the [ fe / h ] derived from fe  i lines by @xmath80.2  dex .",
    "one potential concern is the possibility of non - lte in fe affecting the determination of stellar parameters using ionization equilibrium .",
    "in particular fe overionization has been observed in m dwarfs in the hyades open cluster , where the true fe abundance can be established from a detailed abundance analysis of the hotter members , by @xcite .",
    "they find that the overionization , in the sense of the deduced abundance from fe  ii lines being higher than that from fe  i lines , is considerably smaller in the hyades giants .",
    "a similar problem in the same open cluster was found earlier by @xcite , who demonstrate that the fe  i abundance in the coolest hyades dwarfs they studied is much closer to the cluster mean fe - metallicity .",
    "similarly , in resonance scattering ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the source function , s@xmath39 , is reduced to below the local planck function , thus leading to a stronger line in non - lte .",
    "resonance scattering is seen in the na  d lines of metal - poor stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the oi triplet at 7774    in the sun and may have affected the abundances from the ca  i 4226    resonance line of @xcite .",
    "the slightly negative fe  i slope with excitation potential mentioned above may be a sign that overionization of fe is occurring .",
    "if this were the case , to compensate we would then have been driven to adopt a higher @xmath9than the actual value ; our derived [ fe / h ] values would be too high as indicated above , but the deduced abundance ratios would not be significantly affected by such a decrease in @xmath9 . with this in mind , we adopt asymmetrical uncertainties for @xmath9  of + 100  k , @xmath40  k. since we have been able to achieve satisfactory ionization equilibrium for fe and for ti and at the same time reasonably good excitation equilibrium for fe with a single value of @xmath9  which differs from that set solely from broad band photometry by 50  k or less for 6 of the 8 draco giants , we regard our choices for stellar parameters as satisfactory .",
    "however , we could not find a consistent set of stellar parameters for one of the most luminous and coolest draco giants , draco  xi-2 , that would simultaneously satisfy the above conditions . in particular we could not achieve ti and fe ionization equilibrium simultaneously , and had to adopt compromise values .",
    "ideally , of course , one would like to have a full non - lte 3d analysis including both convection and spherical ( as distinct from plane parallel ) layers for all species , but at the present time this is not practical .",
    "in this section we study the behavior of abundance ratios within draco and compare them to those of galactic halo field stars in detail .",
    "the sample of draco stars with detailed abundance analyses based on high dispersion spectra is now 14 , including the 8 we present here . @xcite and @xcite presented an analysis for 6 draco members .",
    "they used 1 hour exposures per star and observed with hires prior to the major detector upgrade in 2004 .",
    "the most metal - poor star they observed , draco  119 , was reobserved with much longer hires exposures by @xcite as the earlier study only found an upper limit for ba  ii ; they too could only set upper limits for all elements heavier than ni yet very high [ mg / fe ] in the faint hercules dsph galaxy .",
    "these are reminiscent of draco  119 , which until now was believed to be unique in that no element heavier than ni could be detected in its spectrum in spite of a major effort at keck with hires by @xcite . ] .",
    "both studies adopted essentially the same @xmath9  for this star , but the recent work has log(@xmath19 )  0.6  dex larger . although they derive essentially the same [ fe / h ] for this star , there are substantial differences in abundance ratios between these two works , presumably largely due to the much higher snr of the @xcite spectra . in the following we always replace the @xcite abundances for draco  119 with those of @xcite and we refer to this collective data set for six draco giants as @xcite .",
    "our spectra of luminous stars in the draco dsph are not as deep as that of the single star observed by @xcite , but are substantially better than those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we proceed by examining a series of plots ( figs .",
    "[ figure_cfeh ] to [ figure_bafeh ] ) in which we show the draco sample , both our 8 stars ( indicated by large filled circles ) and the 6 observed previously from @xcite ( denoted by open circles , and less accurate than subsequent draco studies ) , with the more accurate revisiting of the star draco  119 by @xcite ( the large open circle ) used in preference to the earlier less accurate values .",
    "these figures also display results from the 0z project led by j.  cohen to datamine the hamburg / eso survey for extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "many of the most metal - poor candidates from this work have been observed with hires at the keck observatory and analyzed in a manner very similar to the present study as described in @xcite and @xcite , with the difference that most of the spectra for the 0z project were taken further towards the blue than those of the draco stars , a move necessary because of the low density of lines in the red in the spectra such low metallicity stars .",
    "only the metal - rich end of the 0z project database , much of which is not yet published ( j.  cohen , n.  christlieb et al , in preparation ) , is shown in these figures .",
    "a number of other halo field star surveys , the most important of which at the lower metallicities probed here is the first stars project @xcite , are shown as well as those stars from @xcite not re - observed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and other sources noted in the symbol key shown on each figure provide coverage at the higher metallicities reached by the draco stars . @xcite",
    "add higher metallicity information for sc and mn .",
    "we examine plots of [ x / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] for each element and use them to look for differences in the chemical inventory between galactic halo field stars and the draco sample , which may be a function of fe - metallicity .",
    "we will see that the differences are small , not larger than @xmath80.3  dex in most cases .",
    "this means that some care is required to ensure that all the abundances from the various sources are homogeneous .",
    "while we have not done a full check of this , we have taken a few steps the first of which is to adjust each survey to our set of solar abundances , particularly to our adopted value of [ fe / h ] , whenever possible .",
    "specific cases where there are clear problems related to issues of homogeneity between the various analyses are discussed individually below .",

    "the lines are linear fits from @xcite to their samples of thick disk and halo dwarfs ( solid line ) and to thin disk dwarfs ( dashed line ) .",
    "they use only the 7770    triplet , with appropriate non - lte corrections ; these lines become detectable in dwarf stars .",

    "the behavior of [ si / fe ] in the draco giants is similar to that described above for [ mg / fe ] , i.e. the lowest metallicity draco giants overlap the galactic halo stars , while at somewhat higher metallicities , where the galactic halo field stars still have elevated [ si / fe ] , @xmath8  + 0.5  dex , the draco stars have fallen to the solar value .",

    "the dependencies on star formation rates , yields of various nuclear reactions , etc . of the various parameters in the toy model are most clear in the case of elements which are produced largely by sources different from those of fe .",
    "the plateau value a(x ) at low [ fe / h ] presumably represents the abundance ratio [ x / fe ] from only those sources of material processed through the nucleosynthesis channels that were active at very early times , i.e. snii from core collapse of massive stars , events characteristic of the earliest epochs of star formation . the plateau level b(x ) represents the abundance ratio for element x at late times when all relevant sources , snia , snii , agb , novae , etc are contributing .",
    "these abundance ratios are independent of accretion of primordial material and , for a well mixed ism , of galactic winds .    the abundance ratios for the @xmath2-elements , produced strongly in snii , but not much in snia , and for the heavy neutron capture elements fall into this category .",
    "on the other hand , when the nucleosynthesis channels for element x are approximately the same as those for fe , we expect that the abundance ratio will be approximately constant , with a(x ) @xmath41 b(x ) @xmath60 , ignoring issues of metallicity dependent yields .",
    "there is overall agreement of the plateau values at both high and low [ fe / h ] for the @xmath2-elements between the draco giants and field halo stars in the milky way .",
    "[ mg / fe ] has the largest range , as might be expected since mg , unlike ca or si , is produced only in snii , while ca and si are produced in both snii and snia @xcite .",
    "a(ca ) is 2@xmath54 low compared to the galactic halo field stars ; all other @xmath2-element plateau values are close to those of the halo field stars .",
    "this suggests that the relative contributions to [ x / fe ] of snii at early times and of a mixture of various sources , dominated by snia , at later times are similar in the cases being compared .",
    "the yields depend both on the rates of various nuclear reactions ( which are mass dependent ) and on the initial mass function for star formation .",
    "the former is fixed by physics , so this implies that there can not be much variation in the latter , i.e. in the initial mass function ( and in the mass loss during the course of evolution of massive stars ) .",
    "the agreement at high [ fe / h ] suggests that the relative contributions of at least the dominant sources must also be the same in the two environments , constraining snia production .",
    "the major differences appear to be confined to the fit parameters [ fe / h](low ) and [ fe / h](high ) which define the point at which [ x / fe ] drops off the low - metallicity plateau and where it approaches the solar value respectively .",
    "these parameters are measures of the delay between when the contribution of snii is dominant and when snia contribute at full strength .",
    "snia are believed to arise from thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf whose mass increases , presumably through mass transfer in a binary system , until explosive carbon burning is ignited .",
    "thus [ fe / h](low ) measures how much [ fe / h ] builds up over the timescale required for the binaries responsible for snia to form , to explode , and to begin to contribute significantly to the chemical inventory of the ism in the dsph , while [ fe / h](high , x ) refers to the time when the snia reach the full level of their contribution .",

    "this delay pattern for a specific burst of star formation is to first order fixed by the imf .",
    "the fe - metallicity built up in draco over this fixed timescale , corresponding to [ fe / h](low ) , is lower in draco than it is in the galactic halo . given that we have already offered some evidence that the imfs are similar , this must constrain some combination of the star formation efficiency , the rate of loss of gas processed through stars and hence enhanced in both x and fe , and the rate of accretion of primordial gas consisting mostly of h , each of which affect the relationship between @xmath49[fe / h]@xmath61 in the stellar system and time . more detailed models for chemical evolution",

    "recent models of chemical evolution for the disk , bulge , and halo of the milky way based on the precepts first established by @xcite have been presented by several groups , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these models assume an initial mass function , a star formation history , a mass infall history , outflow from galactic winds , all as functions of time .",
    "they generally assume complete and uniform mixing of the gas over the total volume considered at all times with the exception of the sophisticated model of @xcite , which includes 3d hydrodynamic simulations of the ism and the spatial variation of its properties .",
    "such models combine networks of nuclear reactions from snii with yields from @xcite or @xcite , from snia with yields generally from @xcite ; some also add in the contributions to the light elements from agb winds and novae .",
    "they have been reasonably successful in reproducing the chemical evolution of the major components of the milky way overall , although failing in some ( minor ) details .",
    "the evolution of the dsph galaxies differs in principle from that of the milky way or its halo .",
    "their binding energies are lower , so the importance of gas loss may be higher , particularly material from snii , for which the ejection velocity is significantly larger than the escape velocity so that a considerable fraction of the enriched gas may be lost from the galaxy ; evidence for this happening today in small starburst galaxies is given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that if the dark matter halo is sufficiently massive , snii ejecta may be pushed far out into the halo , away from the central region where stars form , but remain confined within the halo .",
    "furthermore since draco at present shows no evidence for the presence of gas , gas loss via a galactic wind or through interactions between the dsph satellite and its host , the milky way , must have been important in the past .",
    "these galaxies also show the consequences of lower star formation efficiency which leads to slower star formation overall without the large initial burst that dominates nucleosynthesis in most of the milky way components . in a system where the star formation rate is more constant with time ,",
    "snia ejecta can become important contributors before [ fe / h ] just from snii production builds up to high values near @xmath71  dex .",
    "it is this time delay between the snii and snia contributions that dominates discussion of the chemical evolution of dsph galaxies .",
    "note that once substantial gas loss begins , either through a wind or an interaction with the milky way , the star formation rate drops , the snii rate drops precipitously , and thus the injection of @xmath2-elements into the ism drops , while snia continue unaffected , so the fe content of the ism continues to rise .",
    "this then causes the drop in [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios seen in draco and in the other dsph galaxies .",
    "a very useful diagnostic of the star formation rate as a function of time is the age  metallicity relationship .",
    "we construct this for draco using the [ fe / h ] available from detailed abundance analyses for our sample and that of @xcite .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_age_metal ] .",
    "the median age for the luminous draco giants is 7  gyr .",
    "the uncertainty for each individual star is large as an uncertainty in [ fe / h ] of 0.3  dex , typical of that values derived from the ca triplet ( see the appendix ) , introduces an age error of @xmath74  gyr . at a fixed [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the ( @xmath19  @xmath72 ) color changes by @xmath80.015  mag / gyr , thus requiring extremely accurate and well calibrated photometry .",

    "[ figure_age_metal ] suggests a rough age - metallicity relation , with star formation extending over perhaps 5  gyr beginning about 10  gyr ago over which the mean [ fe / h ] decreased by a factor of @xmath85 , although the large uncertainties in age introduce considerable scatter .",

    "[ figure_dsph_2panel ] for [ mg / fe ] and for [ ti / fe ] show the fits for these two galaxies , for draco , and for the milky way thin and thick disk .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that to first order the form of the [ x / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] relations , at least for mg and for ti , are identical to within the uncertainties , but what is changing is the fe - metallicity range , and the knee values [ fe / h](x , low ) and [ fe / h](x , high ) for these two elements .",
    "this reinforces our previous comparison between the draco abundance ratios and those of the stellar population of the milky way .",
    "while the initial low metallicity abundance ratios and the final high metallicity ones are identical to within the uncertainties for most elements , the key differences lie in the [ fe / h ] values corresponding to the knee values , i.e. in the timescale at which the overall metallicity of the system increases .",

    "the cause of the ( small ) difference in behavior of [ mg and si / fe ] vs [ ca , and ti / fe ] at the lowest metallicities in draco is not clear , particularly since si is an explosive @xmath2-element while mg is a hydrostatic one .",

    "qualitatively similar differences in the behavior of the @xmath2-elements vs [ fe / h ] are also seen in the galactic bulge @xcite , but again there are differences in detail as the separation between hydrostatic and explosive @xmath2-elements is cleaner there , i.e. [ si / fe ] behaves like [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] in the galactic bulge .",
    "@xcite suggested that the low @xmath2-element signature in the dsph galaxies is a reflection of the contribution of massive stars with smaller rotation compared to solar neighborhood stars , instead of the conventional interpretation that this is a consequence of a low star formation rate .",
    "current data are significantly better than what was available to him in 2006 . they show that the values of [ @xmath2/fe ] within the lowest fe - metallicity draco giants approach and often reach those of galactic stars , providing additional support for the conventional interpretation that this results from a low star formation rate .",
    "whether the galactic halo could have been formed by accretion of satellite dwarf galaxies has become a question of great current interest ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , among others .",
    "the cold dark matter cosmological model leads to hierarchical galaxy formation in which massive galaxies should be surrounded by numerous lower mass satellite halos ; the stellar component of the galactic halo presumably resulted at least in part from the dissolution of some of these satellites .",
    "but the small number of satellite galaxies known around our galaxy was in conflict with this prediction , a situation often called the `` missing satellites problem '' @xcite .",
    "recently , however , a substantial number of new satellite galaxies of the milky way have been discovered through searching the sdss ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if one multiplies the new discoveries by the fraction of the sky not surveyed by the sdss , taking into account the detection efficiency for finding a low luminosity satellite in the sdss data as a function of distance and total luminosity of the satellite quantified by @xcite , the `` missing satellites '' problem is well on the way to solution .    from the point of view of the chemical inventory of the galactic halo versus that of the dsph satellites of the galaxy , the initial answer to the question poised above given by @xcite was negative . @xcite and his earlier work demonstrated that dsph galaxies clearly have a chemical inventory which reveals signatures of a lower star formation rate and these low luminosity satellites appear to have a smaller fractional contribution of snii in the total chemical inventory than in the galactic halo itself .",
    "but since our work in draco and that published for the carina and for the sgr dsph galaxies show that abundance ratios among stars in dsph galaxies tend to overlap those of galactic halo giants at the lowest fe - metallicities probed , it is possible that the satellites were accreted early in their development",
    ". their properties as we observe them today would then not be relevant to this issue .",
    "@xcite claim , however , that early accretion is still ruled out because of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) they deduce for four dsph galaxies .",
    "given the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) they use for the galactic halo , they claim that dsph galaxies would be expected to contain at least a few stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath5  dex , while they have not to date detected any such stars in the four dsph galaxies in which they have extensive samples from the dart project .",
    "however , we have contributed to refuting this argument by finding a giant in our draco sample with [ fe / h ] from a high dispersion spectrum below @xmath76  dex , the first such discovered .",
    "@xcite have found a few more such stars in the still lower luminosity satellite galaxies using moderate resolution spectra , as have ( after this paper was submitted ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath77  dex in the bootes  i dsph galaxy found by @xcite may not actually be so fe - poor , as their fe - metallicities are from ca lines assuming [ ca / fe ] = + 0.3  dex , which is probably too large for stars in a dsph galaxy , so they require further verification .",
    "] furthermore , as is discussed in the appendix , the calibration adopted by the dart project to convert measurements of the strength of the ca infrared triplet into fe - metallicities is quite different at very low metallicities from that we use here , and with their adopted calibration , it is quite unlikely that they would have found any stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath77  dex in their dsph samples , even if they did exist , an issue also discussed by @xcite . in this context , it is interesting to note that the star in sextans recently found to have [ fe / h ] @xmath78  dex by @xcite has [ fe / h](cat ) from the dart team of @xmath23  dex assigned in @xcite , later revised to @xmath79  dex by @xcite ( see fig .  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "in addition @xcite recently completed a determination of the halo mdf based based on the hamburg / eso survey which shows that completeness corrections are important in the mdf derived from the he s .",
    "collectively this very recent work serves to help reestablish the scenario for the formation of the galactic halo via accretion of satellite galaxies as viable .",
    "the material now in the inner halo of the galaxy had to have been accreted early in the star formation history of the dsph galaxies , giving time for orbital mixing to eliminate traces of discrete stellar streams , while satellite galaxies accreted somewhat later could contribute to populating the outer halo , which shares many of the abundance anomalies of the dsph galaxies",
    ". dissolved globular clusters had to disperse fairly quickly before the light element correlations among na , mg and al developed , as these are not seen among halo field stars .",
    "finally we comment on the possible presence of a significant intermediate age population in the draco dsph galaxy .",
    "@xcite found several carbon stars in this dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite , in an effort to determine the highest metallicity reached in draco , probed stars redward of the rgb , but found that they were either non - members or carbon stars , to establish an upper bound for this dsph of [ fe / h ] @xmath80  dex ( the highest metallicity star in our draco sample has [ fe / h ] very close to this value . ) @xcite recently surveyed draco in the near - ir and found a few more carbon star candidates .",
    "the presence of these c stars has been used to argue for an intermediate age population in draco , and for a difference between the stellar population of draco vs that of the galactic globular cluster system , where such c - rich stars are very rare .",
    "@xcite point out that the carbon star specific frequency in draco is 25  100 times higher than that of the galactic globular clusters .",
    "however , study of the halo stellar population found in the hamburg / eso survey by the 0z project @xcite reveals the presence of numerous very carbon - rich stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath81  dex . while the exact frequency of such stars is uncertain ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is somewhere between 14 and 25% .",
    "this is a metallicity dependent phenomenon , with carbon rich stars becoming more frequent as [ fe / h ] decreases and the amount of c which must be dredged up to get to a situation where @xmath27(c)@xmath82(o ) consequently drops .",
    "it is for this reason that such c - stars are rare in the galactic globular clusters , most of which have [ fe / h ] substantially larger than that of the mean of the draco stellar population .",
    "in addition , the ir photometry of @xcite demonstrates that draco s c - stars are at luminosities near or well below the rgb tip ; they are not the very luminous intermediate age c - stars seen in the lmc .",
    "we suggest instead that these are these just ordinary low metallicity c - stars similar to those in the galactic halo , and in themselves do not imply the presence of an intermediate age population .",
    "we present an abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra obtained with hires on the keck  i telescope of 8 stars in the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "the sample was selected to span the full range in metallicity inferred from @xcite , who used moderate resolution spectroscopy for radial velocity members of this dsph galaxy found by earlier surveys , e.g. @xcite and others .",

    "for the explosive @xmath2-elements ca and ti , the abundance ratios are low over the full metallicity range of the draco dsph stars compared to galactic halo giants , being closer , but still slightly low , at the lowest fe - metallicities , traits shared by outer galactic halo field stars .",
    "nucleosynthetic yields sensitive to the neutron excess , hence to the initial metallicity of the sn progenitor @xcite , may be important in explaining the origin of differences between draco giants and galactic field stars for several of the abundance ratios studied here .",
    "the heavy neutron capture elements sr and ba have abundance ratios with respect to fe comparable to or lower than those of the lowest halo giants selected from much more extensive surveys . the @xmath4-process contribution to the production of heavy elements inferred from the ratio of ba to eu begins at significantly lower fe - metallicity than in the galactic halo .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in these results is the possibility of differential non - lte or 3d effects between the very cool luminous giants in our sample from the draco dsph and the comparison halo field and globular cluster stars , which are somewhat hotter . with a 30-m telescope it will be possible to reach lower luminosity and somewhat hotter draco giants where these issues will be less important .",
    "we develop a toy model which we use to illuminate these trends , and to compare them with those of galactic globular clusters and of giants from the carina and sgr dsph galaxies .",
    "the model has consists of a plateau in [ x / fe ] at low and at high [ fe / h ] connected by a straight line .",
    "there are four parameters determined directly from the data defining the plateau characteristics and two additional fit parameters which indicate the knee values . since there is such good agreement in almost all cases for the abundance ratios at the lowest metallicity within a given sample and also the highest metallicities sampled",

    "the draco system has the slowest evolution of metallicity in its stars of the three , as well as the lowest mean [ fe / h ] for its giants , sgr is intermediate , and the carina dsph is closest to the milky way halo and the thick disk .",

    "we note the presence of a draco giant with [ fe / h ] @xmath5  dex in our sample .",
    "this combined with other recent evidence for a small number of extremely low metallicity stars in other dsph galaxies reaffirms that the inner galactic halo could have largely been formed by early accretion and dissolution of galactic satellite galaxies and by globular clusters which dissolved prior to the imprinting of an agb signature , while the outer halo could have formed largely from those dsph galaxies accreted later .",
    "@xcite point out that the fraction of carbon stars in draco is is 25  100 times higher than that of the galactic globular clusters , and this has been viewed as an indication of the presence of an intermediate age stellar population .",
