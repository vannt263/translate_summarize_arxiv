    "the study of gas in absorption against background quasars ( quasar absorption systems ) has a long and rich observational history @xcite .",
    "damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) , defined as systems with column density @xmath7 , are of particular interest for studies of galaxy formation because they are believed to arise predominantly from neutral gas within or closely associated with galaxies .",
    "dlas are believed to contain the majority of neutral gas in the universe @xcite and are therefore reservoirs for future star formation . indeed , absorption studies are currently the only means of probing the  content of galaxies at significant redshifts and provide an orthogonal means of studying galaxy evolution .",
    "observational properties that can be measured for dlas include their number density and column density distribution , metallicities , and kinematic properties @xcite .",
    "these observations provide important constraints on the gas content of galaxies at high redshift , and indirectly constrain how gas is converted into stars , and how gas and metals are cycled into and out of galaxies in inflows and outflows .",
    "these , in turn , provide key constraints on some of the most uncertain aspects of our models of galaxy formation .    there has been a significant amount of observational activity and progress in this area in recent years .",
    "large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and boss @xcite have provided extensive target samples of optically detected quasars , yielding greatly improved statistics for samples of high redshift absorbers ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these improved statistics have greatly tightened the constraints on the shape of the column density distribution function , comoving line density of dlas , and the evolution of the cosmological neutral gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite employed a cross - correlation analysis of dlas from the boss survey with the ly@xmath0 forest and were able to obtain constraints on the dla cross - section as a function of halo mass . @xcite and",
    "@xcitehave published metallicities for a large number of dlas in the redshift interval @xmath9 , providing constraints on the build - up of heavy elements in the cold gas phase of galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "in addition , the uv - sensitive cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) is now enabling studies of dlas at lower redshift @xmath10 , which may be more easily connected with populations detected in emission and with the present day galaxy population @xcite .",
    "recent studies with cos have also yielded a wealth of information on ionized gas within low - redshift haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "two different pictures for the origin and nature of dlas have been debated in the literature . based on the observed kinematics of low - ionization metal systems in dlas , @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pw97 ) presented a picture in which thick , extended disc galaxies give rise to dlas , yet explaining how a sufficient number of large disc galaxies could have formed by @xmath11 remains a challenge .",
    "in contrast , in the context of the hierarchical picture arising in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony , many dlas would be expected to be associated with smaller , lower mass systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . however , reproducing the distribution of dla kinematics has remained a significant challenge for hierarchical models @xcite .",
    "these two scenarios have very different implications for galaxy evolution  the former requires large disc galaxies to be in place by @xmath12 , and the latter has implications for the expected star formation rates , stellar masses , and kinematics of dlas and their counterparts .",
    "a number of previous theoretical studies have made specific predictions for the properties of dlas in the framework of the cdm paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "early numerical hydrodynamic simulations typically neglected feedback from stellar and supernova - driven winds , or contained weak forms of stellar feedback .",
    "these simulations had moderate success in reproducing the column density distribution , cosmological neutral gas density , and line density of dlas at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) , although they had difficulty reproducing the turnover in the column density distribution at @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "these simulations were not able to discriminate between different phases of gas , and it was speculated that the turnover could be due to the -h@xmath15 transition .",
    "however , recent observational results from the boss survey @xcite have shown that while these high column density systems are rare , they do exist , relaxing some of this tension , although the origin of the turnover still remains something of a puzzle @xcite .",
    "many of these simulations had relatively small volumes and modeled the dla column density distribution by characterizing the relationship between dla cross - section and dark matter ( dm ) halo mass , then convolving this relationship with a dm halo mass function from larger volume dissipationless simulations .",
    "more recent simulations found that the inclusion of more effective stellar feedback and winds had a significant effect on the predicted dm halo mass to dla cross section relationship .",
    "for example , @xcite found that in simulations with strong winds , galaxies in low mass haloes ejected much of their gas , resulting in a lower dla cross section , thus shifting the dla population into higher mass host haloes .",
    "qualitatively similar results have been found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , although the detailed slope , normalization , and redshift dependence of the predicted halo mass to dla cross section relationship are different in these different simulations .",
    "recently , @xcite particularly emphasized the importance of outflows for reproducing the observed properties of dlas including their kinematics .",
    "cdm - based models have also had difficulty reproducing the observed metallicities of dlas @xcite .",
    "they have consistently predicted higher average metallicities , and none have reproduced the tail to very low metallicity , although again , simulations with strong stellar feedback and winds have been more successful .",
    "@xcite find that a significant number of @xmath16 dlas originiate in intergalactic gas .",
    "a combination of these intergalactic dlas and the ejection of metals by galactic winds lowers the average metallicities , bringing them into better agreement with observations .",
    "semi - analytic models ( sams ) , based within the framework of the cdm paradigm for structure formation @xcite , have been widely used to produce a general picture of how density fluctuations in the primordial universe evolve into the observable galaxy population @xcite . rather than solving detailed equations of hydrodynamics and thermodynamics for individual particles or grid cells , sams use simple but physically motivated `` recipes '' to track bulk quantities such as the total mass in stars , hot gas , cold gas , metals , etc , in various `` zones '' ( e.g. within a galaxy , within a dark matter halo , in a halo infall region , or in the intergalactic medium ) . in some cases ,",
    "sams attempt to track these quantities in radial bins within a galactic disc @xcite .",
    "although they can not offer the detailed spatial and kinematic information provided by fully numerical hydrodynamical simulations , sams do have a number of advantages over these techniques .",
    "numerical hydro simulations of galaxy formation still must rely heavily on `` sub - grid '' recipes for important processes such as star formation and stellar feedback .",
    "these are treated in a similar manner in sams , but the effect of varying the details of these recipes and their parameters can be explored much more thoroughly because of their greater computational efficiency .",
    "sams can provide `` mock catalogs '' for very large numbers of galaxies , comparable to modern surveys , while this is still inaccessable for numerical hydro simulations . finally",
    ", we still do not understand many of the details of the physics that shapes galaxy formation .",
    "it is easier to explore , albeit qualitatively , somewhat more schematic solutions in sams , which may point the way towards more physically rigorous investigations with numerical techniques .",
    "sams have been used extensively to investigate and interpret observations of nearby and distant galaxies in emission . a recent generation of sams that incorporates feedback from accreting black holes has been shown to be successful at reproducing a broad range of observations .",
    "these include the stellar mass function and luminosity function , gas fraction vs. stellar mass relation , and relative fraction of early vs. late type galaxies as a function of stellar mass at @xmath17 , and the evolution of the global stellar mass density and star formation rate density with redshift from @xmath18 to 0 @xcite .",
    "however , these models still fail to reproduce some important observations .",
    "for example , they predict that low mass galaxies form too early and are too quiescent at late times , reflecting star formation histories that apparently do not match observational constraints @xcite .",
    "numerical hydrodynamical simulations with similar implementation of `` sub - grid '' recipes largely show the same successes and problems @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that inadequacies in our modeling of star formation and/or stellar feedback are likely culprits for these remaining difficulties in reproducing observations of low - mass galaxies .",
    "meanwhile , recent observational and theoretical work has greatly advanced our understanding of the physics that regulates star formation on galactic scales . the vast majority of previous cosmological simulations relied on the classical `` kennicutt - schmidt '' ( ks ) relation as a recipe for describing how cool gas turns into stars .",
    "the ks relation , based on observations of nearby spiral galaxies and starburst nuclei , says that the star formation rate surface density ( @xmath19 ) is proportional to the total gas surface density ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "the ks relation is frequently approximated as a power law , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , above a critical total gas surface density @xmath23 .",
    "empirical studies have shown that @xmath2410   @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that @xmath19 is more tightly correlated with the density of _ molecular _ hydrogen @xmath25 ( as traced by co ) than with the total gas density .",
    "these results were confirmed and expanded upon with the results from the things survey @xcite combined with co maps from bima song and heracles @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that @xmath26 with @xmath27 very close to unity , implying that star formation takes place in molecular gas with roughly constant efficiency @xcite .",
    "these results underlined the importance of modeling the partitioning of gas into atomic and molecular phases in theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
    "@xcite showed that , empirically , the fraction of molecular to molecular plus atomic gas , @xmath28 , in nearby spirals is tightly correlated with the disc midplane pressure . @xcite",
    "proposed a theoretical explanation for this relationship , arguing that the thermal pressure in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , which is proportional to the uv heating rate and therefore to the sfr , adjusts until it balances the midplane hydrostatic pressure set by the vertical gravitational field .",
    "other recent theoretical work has argued that , as h@xmath15 forms most efficiently on dust grains , the metallicity of the gas , along with its surface density , should be an important factor in determining @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "using high resolution numerical simulations of isolated galaxies with detailed chemistry and an h@xmath15-based star formation recipe , @xcite showed that @xmath29 depended on metallicity , gas surface density , and the uv background radiation .",
    "@xcite characterized this dependence in detail with high resolution numerical cosmological simulations with detailed chemistry .",
    "the impact on the structural properties of disc galaxies of using an h@xmath15-based star formation recipe rather than a traditional ks recipe has recently been explored with high resolution `` zoom - in '' cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "several sam - based studies have modelled the partitioning of gas into atomic and molecular phases using various approaches , and studied the effect of using an h@xmath15-based star formation recipe .",
    "@xcite partitioned gas into atomic and molecular components using the empirical pressure - based relation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter br ) in post - processing on the millennium semi - analytic models .",
    "@xcite and @xcite implemented gas partitioning self - consistently into sams using two approaches : the empirical pressure - based recipe of br , and the theoretically motivated metallicity - dependent recipe of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kmt09 ) .",
    "these models then implemented an h@xmath15-based star formation recipe based on their computed h@xmath15 fractions .",
    "using a similar approach , somerville , popping & trager ( in prep ; spt14 ) explored the partitioning of gas using the br recipe , the kmt recipe , and an additional metallicity dependent recipe provided by gnedin & kravtsov ( gk ) , along with an h@xmath15-based star formation recipe based on the @xcite observational results .",
    "they concluded that the gk recipe was more successful and robust , particularly at low metallicities , than the kmt formulation ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "* hereafter pst14 ) presented the predictions of these models for the gas content of galaxies in , h@xmath15 , and co from redshift six to zero for direct comparison with upcoming surveys of gas tracers in emission .",
    "the sam developed by spt14 does not predict the internal structure of galaxies in detail , so we assume that the density profiles of the gas and stellar discs are described by a smooth exponential function in both the vertical and radial dimensions .",
    "we rely on simplified approximations to estimate the scale length of the gas disc from the specific angular momentum ( spin ) of the host dark matter halo .",
    "this approach has been shown to reproduce the evolution of stellar disc sizes ( as traced by their optical light ) from @xmath30 to 0 @xcite , and also reproduces the observed sizes of discs in the nearby universe , the observed sizes of co discs in local and high redshift galaxies for the small sample currently available , and the spatial extent of the sfr density in nearby and high - redshift galaxies ( pst14 ) .",
    "however , we also consider models in which the gas is more extended than in our standard models , either because the gas that forms the disc or is accreted onto the disc has higher specific angular momentum than the dark matter halo ( as some numerical simulations suggest ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accreted gas from cold streams deposit their angular momentum to the inner parts of the halo @xcite , or the gas is in a non - rotationally supported extended configuration such as tidal tails or an outflow @xcite .    in this paper , we make use of the sams developed in spt14 and pst14 to explore for the first time the predictions for the properties of dlas in semi - analytic models with partitioning of gas into different phases and an h@xmath15-based star formation recipe .",
    "we investigate the impact of the gas partitioning , star formation recipe , and assumptions about the structure of the cold gaseous disc on the main observable properties of dlas and confront our predictions with the latest observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sims ] , we describe the `` base - line '' semi - analytic models , the new recipes for partitioning gas into an atomic and molecular component , and the new h@xmath15-based star formation recipes .",
    "we also describe our methodology for generating gas distributions , and how we compile mock catalogs of dlas . in section [ sec : results ] , we present our predictions for key dla observables , including the dla column density distribution as a function of redshift , dla cross - section as a function of halo mass and redshift , comoving density of dlas and cosmological neutral gas density as a function of redshift , distribution of dla velocity widths , dla metallicity distribution , and dla metallicity as a function of velocity width and redshift .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section [ sec : discussion ] , and summarize and conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout this paper , we adopt the following values for the cosmological parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . our adopted baryon fraction is 0.1658 .",
    "these values are consistent with the seven - year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) results @xcite .",
    "all quoted metallicities are relative to solar .",
    "the semi - analytic models ( sams ) used here to compute the formation and evolution of galaxies within a @xmath36cdm cosmology were originally presented in @xcite and @xcite , with significant changes described in detail in , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s12 ) , and most recently in spt14 .",
    "the s12 sam includes the following physically motivated ingredients : ( 1 ) the growth of dark matter structure in a hierarchical clustering framework as described by ` merger trees ' , ( 2 ) shock heating and radiative cooling of gas , ( 3 ) conversion of cold gas into stars via an empirical ` kennicutt - schmidt ' relation , ( 4 ) evolution of stellar populations , ( 5 ) a combination of feedback and metal enrichment of the interstellar and intracluster medium from supernovae , ( 6 ) ` quasar ' and ` radio ' mode black hole growth and feedback from agn , ( 7 ) starbursts and morphological transformation due to galaxy mergers . here , we briefly summarize these ingredients  for a more detailed description of the model framework , see s08 and s12 .",
    "the ingredients in the models used here are the same as those described in s12 , with the exception of the new recipes for gas partitioning and star formation , which we describe below . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a standard @xmath36cdm universe and a chabrier stellar initial mass function ( imf ; * ? ? ?",
    "the merging histories ( or merger trees ) of dark matter haloes are constructed based on the extended press - schechter formalism using the method described in @xcite , with improvements described in s08 .",
    "these merger trees record the growth of dark matter haloes via merging and accretion , with each `` branch '' representing a merger of two or more haloes .",
    "we follow each branch back in time to a minimum progenitor mass @xmath37 .",
    "we refer to @xmath37 as the mass resolution of our simulation where we have adopted @xmath38 in all the models presented here .",
    "our sams give nearly identical results when run on the eps merger trees or on merger trees extracted from dissipationless n - body simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; porter et al . in prep ) .",
    "whenever dark matter haloes merge , the central galaxy of the largest progenitor becomes the new central galaxy , and all others become ` satellites ' .",
    "satellite galaxies lose angular momentum due to dynamical friction as they orbit and may eventually merge with the central galaxy . to estimate this merger timescale we use a variant of the chandrasekhar formula from @xcite .",
    "tidal stripping and destruction of satellites are also included as described in s08 .",
    "we have checked that the resulting mass function and radial distribution of satellites ( sub - haloes ) agrees with the results of high - resolution n - body simulations that explicitly follow sub - structure @xcite .    before reionization",
    ", each halo contains a mass of hot gas equal to the univeral baryon fraction times the virial mass of the halo .",
    "after reionization , which we assume to be complete by @xmath39 , the photoionizing background suppresses the collapse of gas into low - mass haloes .",
    "we use the results of @xcite and @xcite to model the fraction of baryons that can collapse as a function of halo mass after reionization .",
    "when a dark matter halo collapses or experiences a merger that more than doubles the mass of the largest progenitor , the hot gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the new halo .",
    "this gas then cools and collapses based on a simple spherically symmetric model .",
    "we assume that cold gas is accreted only by the central galaxy , even though realistically , satellite galaxies should receive some fraction of the new cold gas .    all newly cooling gas collapses to form a rotationally supported disc .",
    "the scale radius is based on the initial angular momentum of the gas and the halo profile , assuming angular momentum is conserved and the self - gravity of the collapsing baryons causes contraction in the inner part of the halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this approach reproduced the observed size versus stellar mass relation for discs from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . in this scenario ,",
    "the cold gas specific angular momentum is set equal to that of the dark matter : @xmath42 .",
    "star formation occurs in two modes , a `` normal '' mode in isolated discs , and a merger - driven `` starburst '' mode .",
    "star formation in the `` normal '' mode is modelled as described in section [ sec : sfr ] below .",
    "the efficiency and timescale of the merger driven burst mode is a function of the merger mass ratio and the gas fractions of the progenitors , and is based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations of binary galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "some of the energy from supernovae and massive stars is assumed to be deposited in the ism , resulting in the driving of a large - scale outflow of cold gas from the galaxy .",
    "the mass outflow rate is parameterized as a function of the galaxy circular velocity times the star formation rate , as motivated by the `` energy driven '' wind scenario .",
    "some fraction of this ejected gas escapes from the potential of the dark matter halo , while some is deposited in the hot gas reservoir within the halo , where it becomes eligible to cool again .",
    "the fraction of gas that is ejected from the disc but retained in the halo versus ejected from the disc and halo is a function of the halo circular velocity ( see s08 for details ) , such that low - mass haloes lose a larger fraction of their gas .",
    "the gas that is ejected from the halo is kept in a larger `` reservoir '' , along with the gas that has been prevented from falling in due to the photoionizing background .",
    "this gas is allowed to `` re - accrete '' onto the halo as described in s08 .",
    "each generation of stars also produces heavy elements , and chemical enrichment is modelled in a simple manner using the instantaneous recycling approximation . for each parcel of new stars",
    "@xmath43 , we also create a mass of metals @xmath44 , which we assume to be instantaneously mixed with the cold gas in the disc .",
    "the yield @xmath45 is assumed to be constant , and is treated as a free parameter .",
    "when gas is removed from the disc by supernova driven winds as described above , a corresponding proportion of metals is also removed and deposited either in the hot gas or outside the halo , following the same proportions as the ejected gas .",
    "mergers are assumed to remove angular momentum from the disc stars and to build up a spheriod .",
    "the efficiency of disc destruction and spheroid growth is a function of progenitor gas fraction and merger mass ratio , and is parameterized based on hydrodynamic simulations of disc - disc mergers @xcite .",
    "these simulations indicate that more `` major '' ( closer to equal mass ratio ) and more gas - poor mergers are more efficient at removing angular momentum , destroying discs , and building spheroids .",
    "note that the treatment of spheroid formation in mergers used here has been updated relative to s08 as described in @xcite .",
    "the updated model produces good agreement with the observed fraction of disc vs. spheroid dominated galaxies as a function of stellar mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* porter et al . in prep ) .",
    "in addition , mergers drive gas into galactic nuclei , fueling black hole growth . every galaxy is born with a small `` seed '' black hole ( typically @xmath46 in our standard models ) . following a merger ,",
    "any pre - existing black holes are assumed to merge fairly quickly , and the resulting hole grows at its eddington rate until the energy being deposited into the ism in the central region of the galaxy is sufficient to significantly offset and eventually halt accretion via a pressure - driven outflow .",
    "this results in self - regulated accretion that leaves behind black holes that naturally obey the observed correlation between bh mass and spheroid mass or velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "there is a second mode of black hole growth , termed `` radio mode '' , that is thought to be associated with powerful jets observed at radio frequencies .",
    "in contrast to the merger - triggered mode of bh growth described above ( sometimes called `` bright mode '' or `` quasar mode '' ) , in which the bh accretion is fueled by cold gas in the nucleus , here , hot halo gas is assumed to be accreted according to the bondi - hoyle approximation @xcite .",
    "this leads to accretion rates that are typically only about @xmath47 times the eddington rate , so that most of the bh s mass is acquired during episodes of `` bright mode '' accretion .",
    "however , the radio jets are assumed to couple very efficiently with the hot halo gas , and to provide a heating term that can partially or completely offset cooling during the `` hot flow '' mode ( we assume that the jets can not couple efficiently to the cold , dense gas in the infall - limited or cold flow regime ) .      throughout this paper",
    "we refer rather loosely to `` cold '' gas , which is gas that according to our simple cooling model has been able to cool below @xmath48 k via radiative atomic cooling .",
    "most previous cosmological simulations have considered all of this `` cold '' gas to be eligible to form stars . here",
    ", we partition it into components that we label atomic , molecular , and ionized , and only allow the `` molecular '' component to participate in star formation .",
    "as we do not explicitly track the temperature or density of the `` cold '' gas in our models , this is obviously still extremely schematic .",
    "however , when we refer to `` cold '' gas , we are referring to gas that is in one of these three states and is dynamically associated with the galactic disc ( rather than in an extended hot halo , an outflow , etc ) .    at each timestep , we compute the scale radius of the cold gas disc using the angular momentum based approach described above , and assume that the _ total _ ( + ) cold gas distribution is described by an exponential with scale radius @xmath49 .",
    "we do not attempt to track the scale radius of the stellar disc separately , but make the simple assumption that @xmath50 , with @xmath51 fixed to match stellar scale lengths at @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite showed that this is a fairly good representation , on average , for the discs of nearby spirals .",
    "we then divide the gas disc into radial annuli and compute the fraction of molecular gas , @xmath52 $ ] , in each annulus , as described below .",
    "most ( if not all ) previous semi - analytic models have neglected the ionized gas associated with galaxies , which may be ionized either by an external background or by the radiation field from stars within the galaxy . here",
    "we include a simple analytic estimate of the ionized gas fraction motivated by the model presented in @xcite .",
    "we assume that some fraction of the total cold gas in the galaxy , @xmath53 , is ionized by the galaxy s own stars .",

    "recent work in which a variable conversion factor between co and @xmath95 is accounted for suggests that @xmath97 for high @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this steepening is also expected on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "therefore , in spt14 we also considered an -based star formation recipe of the form    @xmath98    in spt14 , we found that the `` two - slope '' star formation recipe produces better agreement with observations of star formation rates and stellar masses in high redshift galaxies , so we adopt it in all of the models presented in this work .",
    "for the parameter values , we adopt @xmath99 , @xmath100 pc@xmath101 , and @xmath102 , consistent with the observational results discussed above .",
    "we consider nine main variants of our models : three recipes for gas partitioning ( the pressure - based br recipe and the metallicity - based gk recipe with a fixed / variable uv radiation field ) , and three choices for the specific angular momentum of the gas relative to the dark matter halo , parameterized by @xmath103 .",
    "we consider fixed values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and also a set of models in which @xmath103 is set based on the merger history of the galaxy .",
    "* the @xmath105 models result in stellar and gaseous disks with higher specific angular momentum than their dark matter halos , and are motivated by numerical simulations that suggest this situation may arise due to stellar driven winds and/or cold flows ( see section [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : disc_gas ] for a more detailed discussion and references ) . * in the merger models , we compute the disc properties and star formation rates using the @xmath104 models , then place the gas in a more extended distribution based on the halo s merger history , as we discuss further below .",
    "these model variants are denoted gkfj1 , gkj1 , brj1 , gkfj25 , gkj25 , brj25 , gkfjm , gkjm , and brjm and are summarized in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "while we only model azimuthally symmetric extended cold gas discs , we consider them as a proxy for other processes thay may cause the gas to be more extended .",
    "although we use the same -based star formation recipe in all of our models , both the choice of @xmath103 and the gas partitioning recipe can affect the star formation efficiency .",
    "a larger value of @xmath103 leads to larger discs and lower gas densities overall , less efficient formation of  and less efficient star formation .",
    "similarly , the different gas partitioning recipes lead to different  fractions as a function of mass and redshift ( see pst14 ) and therefore again to higher or lower star formation efficiency , since only  can form stars in our models .",

    "studies of hi in absorption are currently the _ only _ means of probing atomic gas at significant redshift , and this will remain true for quite some time at redshifts much greater than unity , although new radio telescopes such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) and its precursors will push studies of  in emission up to @xmath1121.5 .",
    "dlas are thought to contain the bulk of the  in the universe and extensive observations of their properties exist in the literature . in spite of this ,",
    "theoretical models of galaxy formation based on the predominant @xmath36cdm  paradigm have not been terribly successful at reproducing several of these observations , and therefore the connection between dlas and the galaxy population detected through their emission properties remains unclear .",
    "although our models rely on a number of simplifying assumptions , our study is the first to attempt to predict the properties of dlas in a model that includes both the cosmological formation of galaxies and the partitioning of the cold ism in galaxies into different phases ( ionized , atomic , and molecular ) , based on physically motivated recipes .",
    "in addition , unlike the numerical hydrodynamic simulations that have been predominantly used for previous studies of dla properties , our semi - analytic models broadly reproduce a large suite of observations that probe the stellar and dust content of galaxies over a broad redshift range ( s08 , s12 ) .",
    "an interesting general insight is that _ in spite _ of the freedom we allowed ourself in adjusting , for example , the distribution of cold gas in galactic discs , _ none _ of the models we considered is really fully satisfactory at reproducing the properties of dlas over all redshifts _ and _ the set of ` calibration ' quantities of @xmath17 galaxies ( e.g. stellar mass functions , hi mass functions ,  mass functions ) .",
    "we found that models with `` standard '' distributions of gas ( @xmath104 ) could not reproduce the column density distribution of dlas at any redshift , in agreement with the results of previous studies @xcite .",
    "this led us to consider models with ` extended ' gas distributions , which reproduced the hi column density distribution , the cosmic evolution of the line density , and @xmath113 quite well at @xmath114 .",
    "however , the models with extended gas distributions and a metallicity - dependent recipe for  formation were too inefficient at forming stars and predicted stellar fractions that were too low , and hi fractions that were too high , at @xmath17 .",
    "this is because the extended gas models place a large amount of gas at low surface density where it is inefficient at forming stars .",
    "the metallicity - based extended - gas model with a varying - uv background ( gkj25 ) performs better than the model with a fixed uv background , as the reduced uv background in low - mass systems results in weaker suppression of the star formation efficiency .",
    "the pressure - based extended - gas brj25 recipe fared better with the @xmath17 stellar mass function , but still overproduces the number of -rich galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "this may reflect the overly simple assumption of a fixed value of @xmath103 in all galaxies and at all redshifts that we made in this work .",
    "we motivated our assumption based on numerical hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "these simulations have shown that the average specific angular momentum @xmath115 of the baryonic disc can be larger than that of the dm halo if low-@xmath115 material is preferentially ejected by winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if the disc is formed by cold flows @xcite , or if the gas is spun up in a gas - rich major merger @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the effective value of @xmath103 in reality varies between galaxies and may depend on cosmic epoch and the star formation and merger history .",
    "our simple `` merger '' models did not fare well in reproducing the column density distribution or the @xmath113 evolution , indicating that a more physical approach to modeling the extent of the cold gas giving rise to dlas is needed .",
    "in addition , some authors have suggested that some of the absorbing gas giving rise to dlas may not be in a rotationally supported disc at all , but may instead be in an outflow @xcite .",
    "although we stated earlier that our ` extended ' disc models could be interpreted as representing any of these scenarios , this is not entirely consistent .",
    "our models implicitly assume that dlas arise from the cold gas reservoir that has accumulated within the `` box '' that we call a galaxy  i.e. , gas that has cooled and accreted but not turned into stars or been ejected in an outflow .",
    "assuming that this gas is in an extended configuration leads to large amounts of gas at low surface density where it is inefficient at forming stars .",
    "if the cross - section and kinematics of dlas are significantly affected by gas in an outflow , this would have different implications for the star formation efficiency of galaxies which in turn feeds back into the cold gas content as well as metallicities , etc .",
    "we are engaged in a program to study the distribution of gas and metals in high resolution zoom simulations that include a treatment of a multi - phase ism @xcite in order to study these issues and build more sophisticated semi - analytic models for absorption systems .",
    "regardless of these limitations , we believe that we can make some robust and interesting predictions based on our simple models .",
    "our preferred models , the br / varying - uv gk models with extended discs , are somewhat successful at reproducing the line density of dlas and @xmath113 at @xmath116 , indicating that the majority of hi in dlas could plausibly be associated with galactic discs .",
    "subsequently , one interesting suggestion we make is that the observed near constancy of @xmath113 from @xmath117 to @xmath118 is not a reflection of a truly constant global  density , but rather a cosmic coincidence resulting from the dla population being increasingly ` contaminated ' by intergalactic gas in filaments or cold streams at @xmath119 , and systematically under - representing the true  density at @xmath120 due to an increasing contribution to the global  budget from low-  systems .",
    "numerical hydrodynamic simulations do indicate that the number of `` intergalactic '' dlas increases with increasing redshift @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", it is a concern that in several of our models ( in particular the overall more successful br / varying - uv gk models ) the _ total _ cold gas density in all forms ( atomic , and molecular ) barely equals ( brj25/gkj25/gkfj1 ) or is even less than ( brj1/gkj1 ) the   density implied by observations of dlas at @xmath119 .",
    "on the other hand in the fixed - uv , extended gas model ( gkfj25 ) , the total amount of stars at @xmath17 is much less than observations .",
    "we note that a similar problem is seen in many other semi - analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be a reflection of another well - known problem , that low - mass galaxies in these models form too early @xcite .",
    "thus overly efficient star formation at high redshift may be consuming or expelling too much gas , leaving behind too little cold gas in galaxies .",
    "we note that the models with metallicity - based  formation recipes do appear to fare better in this regard .",
    "moreover , this effect may also be impacted by the decreasing average halo mass of dlas with redshift and the mass resolution of our models . in this case",
    ", a contribution from low mass dlas below our resolution limit may explain part of this discrepancy .",
    "correlation studies of dlas are an interesting and powerful method to directly constrain the dla cross section as a function of halo mass . through a cross correlation analysis of dlas with the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath121",
    ", @xcite recently found typical dla halo masses of @xmath122 and dla cross sections @xmath123 kpc@xmath124 .",
    "our ` extended disc ' ( @xmath105 ) models , specifically the brj25 and gkj25 models , produce dlas with comparable cross sections and halo masses at the same redshift , and the predicted slope of the dlas cross - section vs halo mass ( @xmath125-m@xmath126 ) is in reasonable agreement with these observations .",
    "we find that the distribution of @xmath127 for our model dlas depends on both the gas partitioning recipe and the specific angular momentum of the gas ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the @xmath127 distributions for our ` extended disc ' models are significantly better than results from previous sams and most numerical hydrodynamic simulations , with our metallicity - based extended - gas , varying - uv ( gkj25 ) model providing the closest match . similarly to @xcite , we find @xmath127 and disc rotation velocity to be positively correlated , although with a large scatter . the disc rotation velocity corrected for inclination is the primary factor determining the value of @xmath127 . we show that adopting the extended gas discs shifts dlas into more massive haloes , which leads to better agreement with the observed @xmath127 distribution .",
    "we still predict fewer very large @xmath127 systems ( @xmath128 km / s ) than are observed .",
    "this may be because @xmath127 is boosted by outflows in some systems , as suggested by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "additionally , outflows are known to be common among high - redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "another insight from our study is a first indication of how observations of gas at high redshift may help constrain our understanding of how  forms in galactic discs and how cold gas is converted into stars on galactic scales .",
    "some workers have recently emphasized the importance of metallicity in regulating  formation and hence star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , other authors have suggested that the ism is self - regulated on the scales of star - forming regions , so that the star formation rate adjusts itself until the turbulent pressure balances the gravitational restoring pressure , thus suggesting that the disc midplane pressure may be the more fundamental quantity @xcite .",
    "although the metallicity - based , varying - uv background gk model produces slightly better results for dlas , perhaps the more striking result is how similar are these results overall to those of the pressure - based br model .",
    "in addition , we find that including the effects of a varying uv background in the metallicity - based model produces significantly improved results relative to a model in which the galaxy - to - galaxy variation in the uv field is neglected ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the fixed - uv gk models make the dramatic prediction that a large fraction of dlas at all redshifts are composed of nearly `` pristine '' gas with metallicity log @xmath129 , that has never experienced significant star formation . these arise",
    "because the metallicity - based models predict that low surface density , low - metallicity gas is extremely inefficient at forming . in our models",
    ", stars can only form out of  so in these systems , stars never form efficiently and never enrich the gas , so remain `` barren '' unless kick - started by a merger - driven starburst .",
    "we were initially concerned that these systems were an artifact of inaccuracies in our models , but a similar population has recently been pointed out in numerical hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , which incorporate a similar metallicity - based recipe for  formation and -based star formation .",
    "therefore it is interesting to determine how robust these predictions are , and whether such a population is definitively ruled out by observations .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss the presence of a dla metallicity floor of log z @xmath130 , and no lower metallicity dlas have been discovered , although they could have been detected .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find systems in the ly@xmath0 forest with lower metallicities , down to log z @xmath131 .",
    "it is worth noting in this context , however , that we assume that the fitting functions based on numerical simulations with chemistry and simplified radiative transfer hold down to gas metallicities of @xmath132 , while @xcite note that these approximations are uncertain below metallicities of @xmath133 .",
    "in addition , recent high resolution numerical simulations suggest that in low metallicity gas ,  gas can form directly into stars without going through a molecular phase @xcite .",
    "another success of our models is improved agreement with the low metallicities and weak metallicity evolution of dlas , which has been a challenge for previous generations of sams and numerical simulations .",
    "the reduced efficiency of star formation in systems with low mass and/or low metallicity causes dlas to typically have lower metallicities than in previous sams , thereby increasing the slope of the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "our extended - gas brj25 and gkj25 models , with the possibility of observationally motivated metallicity gradients , reproduce the mean metallicities of dlas at @xmath116 , including the slope of the redshift evolution . at @xmath119 ,",
    "the varying - uv gk model predicts metallicities higher than the observations by up to 0.5 dex while the pressure - based br model is in better agreement .",
    "it is worth noting that as we discussed above , the observed population of dlas in this regime may be significantly contaminated by intergalactic gas which would be expected to have lower metallicity .",
    "however , more recently , @xcite find a much weaker evolution in dla metallicity than @xcite .",
    "their sample has a more limited redshift range of @xmath111 , and they note that they find much flatter metallicity evolution when they take the data set from @xcite and only include dlas in the same redshift range .",
    "these results suggest that a significant amount of evolution in the dla metallicity occurs at @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( see figure 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity gradients as steep as @xmath136 dex kpc@xmath81 have been observed in @xmath137 star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "we showed that introducing metallicity gradients of this order significantly changed the predicted metallicity distribution of dlas and its redshift evolution .",
    "thus our work shows that metallicity gradients may play a significant role in reconciling dlas metallicities and their evolution with those measured via emission line diagnostics , underlining the importance of understanding and constraining these gradients in simulations and observations .",
    "another possibility that has been discussed in the literature is that the metallicities of dlas could be biased low due to a selection effect , as metal - rich dlas would also be dusty , perhaps causing their background quasars to drop out of colour or magnitude selected quasar samples . however , using radio - selected quasars , @xcite and @xcite found no significant population of heavily reddened quasars with foreground dlas , suggesting that dlas do not strongly redden quasars . furthermore through stacking quasars with and without dlas along the line of sight , @xcite found that dlas are associated with very small amounts of dust reddening .",
    "these analyses suggest that observations of dlas are not missing dusty , evolved dlas and that they are well - characterized by small amounts of dust and low metallicities .",
    "we have presented predictions for the properties of quasar absorption line systems associated with cold gas in galactic discs , based on a new suite of semi - analytic models that include updated recipes for partitioning gas into an ionized , atomic , and molecular phase , and a molecular hydrogen based star formation recipe .",
    "we present results for three different prescriptions for partitioning gas into an atomic and molecular component : one ( br ) based on the empirical relationship between molecular fraction and gas midplane pressure from @xcite , and two ( gk ) based on numerical hydrodynamic simulations in which the metallicity and the local uv radiation field play a major role in determining the molecular fraction @xcite . in one ,",
    "the local uv radiation field is held fixed to the milky way value , while it is allowed to vary in proportion to the galaxy star formation rate in the other .",
    "in addition , we considered different approaches for how the cold gas is distributed within galaxies , using the parameter @xmath103 to represent the fraction of the specific angular momentum of the dark matter halo material that is `` captured '' by the cold gas within galaxies .",
    "first , we compared our predicted @xmath138 galaxy stellar mass functions and cold gas mass functions to local observations .",
    "we find that models with different physical ingredients produce different amounts of cold gas within galaxies , demonstrating that it is a key diagnostic for constraining theoretical models .",
    "we then selected dlas by passing sightlines through mock catalogs extracted along lightcones from the bolshoi simulation .",
    "the majority of our analysis focused on comparing the properties of these mock dlas with observations of real dlas .",
    "* models with  standard \" gas radial profiles where the cold gas specific angular momentum is equal to that of the dark matter , @xmath104 , fail to reproduce the observed column density distribution function and the number density of dlas .",
    "they also fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths , @xmath1 , of low - ionization metal lines , producing too many low-@xmath1 systems and not enough high@xmath1 systems . * our models with",
    " extended \" gas discs ( @xmath105 ) are able to reproduce the observed column density distribution function over the range @xmath139 at @xmath107 and also the number density of dlas at @xmath140 .",
    "the favored extended disc models produce comparable dla cross sections ( @xmath141 ) , halo masses , and predict a @xmath142 relation with slope and normalization that is in agreement with observations at @xmath121 .",
    "moreover at @xmath107 , these same models also reproduce the @xmath1 distribution fairly well , primarily because they select dlas in higher mass haloes with larger rotational velocities",
    ". however , they produce too many high - m@xmath143 mass galaxies and too few galaxies around the characteristic stellar mass at @xmath17 . * our  extended \" gas disc models reproduce the observed estimates of the comoving density of  in dlas ( @xmath144 ) at @xmath114 , with the model with pressure - based gas partitioning and the one with metallicity - based gas partitioning accounting for a varying uv radiation field producing the best agreement .",
    "all of our models fail to reproduce the number density of dlas and amount of  in dlas at @xmath16 .",
    "we suggest that a significant fraction of dlas at @xmath16 may reside in filaments , cold streams , or clumps of gas not associated with the rotationally supported gas in galactic discs . * the predictions of our favored  extended \" gas disc models for dla metallicities are in much better agreement with observations than previous studies .",
    "additionally , accounting for metallicity gradients motivated by observations of star - forming galaxies at a comparable redshift to the dla sample , we obtain very good agreement with the mean metallicity and metallicity - redshift relation in our models .",
