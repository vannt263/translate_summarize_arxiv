    "veritas , located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory near tucson , arizona , is an array of four 12-meter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "each telescope has a pixelated camera comprised of 499 photomultiplier tubes with a @xmath2 field of view . designed to detect photons of astrophysical origin between 100 gev and 30 tev , veritas detects and images the secondary cherenkov light produced when gamma rays and cosmic rays initiate particle cascades in the upper atmosphere .",
    "stereoscopic reconstruction of events using multiple telescopes allows for single - photon angular resolution of better than @xmath3 and energy resolution on the order of 15 - 25% . in its current configuration",
    ", veritas can detect a source with @xmath4 of the crab nebula flux in less than 30 hours .",
    "the instrument has been operating in full array mode since 2007 .",
    "see @xcite for further details regarding the operation of veritas .",
    "snr  g78.2 + 2.1 , also known as the @xmath0-cygni supernova remnant ( snr ) , is a @xmath5 diameter shell - like radio and x - ray snr@xcite .",
    "it is estimated to be at a distance of @xmath6  kpc@xcite and to be approximately @xmath7 years old@xcite .",
    "it is thought to be in an early phase of adiabatic expansion into a low - density medium@xcite .",
    "a slowly expanding h i shell immediately surrounding the radio shell was found by @xcite , which @xcite believes to have been created by the progenitor stellar wind .",
    "the radio shell divides roughly into northern and southern arcs @xcite .",
    "enhanced thermal x - ray emission in the north suggests shocked gas @xcite and falls in a void of co emission @xcite .",
    "strong optical emission with sulfur lines also characterizes the region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray satellite _ fermi _ , operating at gev energies , has discovered a @xmath0-ray pulsar  at the center of the remnant @xcite .",
    "while this pulsar has a low luminosity ( @xmath8  erg  s@xmath9 ) and a spin - down age ( 76.8  kyr ) much greater than the estimated age of , the pulsar kinematics make it probable that  was born with something close to its current spin period and is the remnant of s progenitor star @xcite .",
    "diffuse @xmath0-ray emission above 10 gev is also reported by _ fermi _  over the full extent of the remnant @xcite .",
    "a point source co - located with  was previously reported in the first and second _ fermi _  catalogs @xcite , but @xcite conclude it to be artifact .",
    "@xcite reported an extended region of emission above a few gev that they interpreted as a freshly accelerated cocoon of cosmic rays .",
    "the cavity defining the cocoon region is outlined by ionization fronts visible in the mid- infrared .",
    "@xmath0-cygni overlaps one end of the cocoon and is a potential source of the cocoon s trapped cosmic rays .",
    "figure  [ fig : excesswithoverlay ] displays the acceptance - corrected very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray excess map of the area around @xcite . an extended source is seen overlapping the northern edge of the remnant , with a detection significance of .",
    "we use a binned , extended maximum - likelihood fit to the raw counts map to assess the  morphology .",
    "the source is modeled in the fit as a symmetric , two - dimensional gaussian convolved with the  point - spread function ( psf ) ; the background is assumed to be flat before exposure effects are taken into account .",
    "we find a fitted extension of the two - dimensional gaussian to be , with fitted centroid coordinates .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the centroid location is @xmath10 , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath11 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty considers both the telescope pointing error and systematic errors of the fit itself @xcite .",
    "the positions of the @xmath0-ray pulsar  ( ) (  from  ) and the centroid of the emission above 10 gev from the remnant ( as seen by _ fermi _  ) are also shown for reference .",

    "the photon spectrum is consistent with a differential power law in energy , @xmath14 , between the analysis threshold of and 10 tev .",

    "it displays the @xmath15 kev exposure - corrected x - ray map using data from asca sequence # 25010000 ( data originally presented by @xcite ) , generated by co - adding data from the two gas imaging spectrometers .",

    "the x - ray spectrum was modeled using an absorbed raymond - smith thermal plasma model with a best - fit temperature of @xmath31 kev . with this model the column density is @xmath32 , the normalization is @xmath33 m and the absorption - corrected flux is @xmath34 in the 0.5@xmath358.0  kev band .",
    "this result differs significantly from that given in @xcite , which claimed an additional power - law component and a large ne ix line feature .",
    "the divergence in results appears to hinge , not on the choice of source region , which is similar , but on the choice of background region @xcite .",
    "we selected a background region that was as close as possible to the source while @xcite chose a region @xmath2 away .",
    "we can produce uchiyama s results by choosing a background region similar to uchiyama s .",
    "for further details , see @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that the vhe @xmath0-ray emission seen from @xmath0-cygni arises from particles accelerated in shocks occuring at the interaction of the supernova ejecta and the surrounding medium .",
    "these particles could be either accelerated electrons , which would produce the emission via inverse - compton scattering , or accelerated nuclei .",
    "should they be high - energy electrons , they would also be expected to produce x - ray synchrotron radiation , which would appear as a non - thermal power - law component in the x - ray spectrum . while our analysis of the asca x - ray spectrum does not argue for a non - thermal component , our upper limit on this component is still weak enough that we can not exclude the possibility that the tev , if not the gev , emission is due to inverse - compton scattering @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also plausible that the vhe @xmath0-ray emission is produced by interaction of accelerated nuclei with the hi shell surrounding the remnant . estimates of the target material density required for accelerated nuclei to produce the observed vhe @xmath0-ray flux , based on @xcite , give a range of densities @xcite consistent @xcite s estimates of the gas density within the hi shell .",
    "however , it must be noted that the shock velocities inferred from the optical and x - ray data are too low for the forward shock to be currently accelerating particles to tev energies . if the vhe @xmath0-ray emission is hadronic , it is likely due to particles accelerated when the remnant was younger that are now interacting with the shell .    the relationship of the cocoon of freshly - accelerated cosmic rays detected by _ fermi",
    "_  to  and  also remains unclear .",
    "it is possible  either has injected or is injecting accelerated particles into the cocoon . however , while they are shown for reference , we caution against using the cocoon contours from @xcite to judge the relationship of the cocoon to the vhe @xmath0-ray emission , since they are derived from an analysis where , which is no longer considered an independent source , was included as part of the background model .",
    "it should also be noted that the vhe @xmath0-ray excess map in this paper was made with the ring - background estimation method , which is ill - suited to detecting a large - scale ( @xmath36 square degree ) region of @xmath0-ray emission such as the cocoon .",
    "therefore the vhe @xmath0-ray maps shown here can not be used to set a meaningful upper limit on cocoon emission above 300 gev .",
    "a conclusion determination of the relationship between  and  will have to await further data , analyzed with more sophisticated analysis techniques .",
