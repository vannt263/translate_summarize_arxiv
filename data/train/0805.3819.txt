    "the search for a quantum theory of gravity is one of the greatest challenges facing theoretical physics today , requiring mathematics far beyond the standard quantum field theory which suffices to describe the other four physical forces .",
    "the approaches of both string theory @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite attack this problem head - on , aiming to construct a quantum theory of gravity in isolation , and leaving unification with the rest of the standard model as a problem for the future .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible there is some benefit in asking , even at this early stage , how a quantum theory of gravity will relate to the rest of the standard model .",
    "one way to pursue this goal might be the construction of extended portions of the standard model which reproduce in some limited domain behaviours which we might associate with gravitation . from such extended theories we might gain insight into the low energy behaviour of a full quantum theory of gravity .",
    "in this paper , i present a modification to the electroweak and higgs sectors of the standard model , introducing several extra bosons which expand the internal symmetry group to either @xmath4 or @xmath0 .",
    "the extra bosons have never been detected , and no attempt is made to claim that they necessarily ever will be ( though prospects for detecting them if they are real are discussed in sections  [ sec : hint ] and [ sec : gdetect ] ) . of greater interest are the consequences of choosing a gauge on the combined internal and external symmetry groups @xmath5 , which may be done in such a manner as to eliminate some of the extra bosons which have been introduced .",
    "moreover , we find that the metric of this co - ordinate frame in the vicinity of an irrotational , spherically symmetric object is the schwarzschild metric , and that in this model we may calculate the value of newton s gravitational constant , @xmath1 .",
    "the result is @xmath2 , which lies within @xmath6 of the nist / codata recommended value of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "consequently , in the vicinity of an irrotational , spherically symmetric massive body the use of this prescription for gauging local lorentz invariance is consistent with einstein s general theory of relativity .    whether this model is physical , or is merely a convenient approximation to some more fundamental theory of gravity with the extra bosons acting as proxy for a more sophisticated underlying interaction , the precision with which it calculates the value of @xmath1 suggests that when the true quantum theory of gravity is found , its behaviour in the low - energy limit will in some way resemble the model presented in this paper . which of the physical hypotheses employed in this model will turn out to be true , and which are merely convenient fictions",

    "we assume that this hypothetical symmetry breaking process does not favour any particular orientation with respect to either external or internal symmetry groups .",
    "we now employ our local @xmath4 symmetry to perform a choice of gauge , first mixing @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 such that @xmath26 from this it follows that @xmath27 , and this is satisfied by @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the space of grassman numbers .",
    "consequently , we may perform a further @xmath30 mixing of @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath31 the requirement that the fermion and boson fields be in equilibrium in the ground state then ensures that the boson fields to which @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 couple are also zero .    in the ground state",

    "as the boson fields in the vacuum state must be in equilibrium with the fermion fields , this also implies non - zero values for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 in the ground state , along with @xmath84 although the symmetry breaking mechanism determines a preferred orientation on the internal space , it does not select a preferred orientation in space  time , and minimisation of the lagrangian will result in field configurations satisfying the euler - lagrange equations of motion , and hence periodic in space and/or time .",
    "consequently , averaged over a sufficiently large region , @xmath85 except for @xmath86 which acquires nonzero mean value through our choice of gauge .",

    "we may compare this to the dirac lagrangian for an electron in its rest frame ( written in terms of weyl spinors ) , @xmath94 which also gives rise to first as well as second order terms .",

    "the second order terms are then @xmath95 for the left - handed electron and @xmath96 for the right - handed electron respectively .",
    "we may identify the dirac expressions with those in ( [ eq : lme ] ) and ( [ eq : rme ] ) , for which the nonzero mean vacuum expectation values @xmath97 and @xmath98 give rise to electron mass .",
    "this should not , however , be taken as implying that @xmath99 , as the intermediate electron state is undetectable and physically irrelevant to the propagation process .",
    "instead , from the @xmath30 symmetry of the electron sector and our choice of basis @xmath100 , we identify @xmath101 for the vacuum state , where @xmath102 is the observed mass of the electron .",

    "the product @xmath113 represents the number of boson interactions occurring for fermions @xmath109 per unit time , and we may expand this as @xmath114 .",

    "two families of higher - order diagrams give rise to corrections to this initial result .",
    "first , there are radiative corrections to the interactions of fig .",
    "[ fig : basicwzmasses ] .",
    "the most significant contribution is electromagnetic , and to one loop this will contribute only to @xmath122 , by modifying the propagator of the intermediary electron ( all our propagators so far are for bare particles , so radiative corrections to these diagrams must be made to the particle propagators as well as to the interactions ) .",
    "this correction to @xmath122 is by a factor of @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the fine structure constant , with @xmath123 being unchanged .",
    "the second correction becomes apparent when , on going to higher orders in @xmath112 , we also permit multiple interactions with the background fields . for @xmath47 boson propagation , the @xmath47 boson may interact with the neutrino fields , and also the intermediate electron may interact with the vacuum @xmath51 , @xmath103 , and photon fields .",
    "the intermediate neutrino of @xmath50 boson propagation , on the other hand , is nearly massless ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : neutrinomass ] ) and it may therefore be inferred that its interactions with the background fields are negligible .",
    "the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : mw4 ] correspond to @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and we see that again , the @xmath47 boson mass is augmented relative to that of the @xmath50 boson .",
    "the correction factor this time is @xmath146 the neutrino interactions similarly correct @xmath147 , but by a factor proportional to @xmath148 , which is safely ignored .",
    "while both of these corrections have the effect of reducing @xmath149 , they are insufficient to bring it down to the observed value of @xmath150 .",
    "this is unsurprising , as there are known to be further weak boson interactions not included in this model .",
    "for example , inclusion of particle generations will give rise to additional terms in the @xmath47 boson propagator where the intermediate particle is a muon rather than an electron .",
    "this will further reduce @xmath149 , as only the @xmath47 boson participates in flavour - changing weak interactions , and hence the @xmath50 boson mass again remains unchanged .",
    "it is even possible that couplings to virtual quarks may play a role . that the computed value of @xmath149 in the partial model presented in this paper is too high is therefore to be expected .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath1 bosons also couple to @xmath119 , and hence an @xmath52 or @xmath1 boson propagating in the presence of vacuum will exhibit rest mass .",
    "following the same process as above , their masses ( to lowest order ) are found to be @xmath151 in terms of known boson masses , because the @xmath52 boson interacts only with neutrinos and @xmath47 bosons , the above corrections are likely to have little effect so we may write @xmath152 for the @xmath1 boson , given its ability to interact with right - handed electrons and the @xmath30 symmetry on the @xmath153 sector of @xmath13 , it is probably more appropriate to write this as @xmath154      the photon , @xmath90 , does not couple to @xmath75 and so does not acquire mass via the mechanism described above .",

    "may then be written as @xmath278 how accurate is this value of @xmath1 ? substituting ( [ eq : gwithcorr ] ) for @xmath112 and reinserting the necessary factors of @xmath138 and @xmath279 , we compute @xmath280 which is of the correct order of magnitude , but differs from the observed value of @xmath281 @xcite by a substantial margin of @xmath282 .",
    "the greatest constraint on the accuracy of the above calculation of @xmath1 is not the accuracy to which the constituent electroweak parameters are known , but rather that the calculation was performed evaluating interaction ( [ eq : hhtogg ] ) only to lowest order .",

    "the leading constraint on our accuracy is lack of knowledge of higher order corrections due to diagrams involving two or more loops .",
    "however , the two - loop correction is anticipated to be of order @xmath289 , and corrections beyond the two - loop level are probably unimportant given current precisions for @xmath200 , @xmath279 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the impact of these further corrections on this result will therefore be small .",
    "note also that the value of @xmath1 computed is independent of our choice of convention for boson number density .",
    "a change @xmath290 will introduce a factor of @xmath291 from @xmath213 but a factor of @xmath292 from the fields corresponding to single @xmath51 and @xmath103 bosons in fig .",
    "[ fig : hhtogg ] .",
    "consequently the value of @xmath1 remains unchanged .",
    "the reader may wonder at the origin of an apparent new constant in the form of @xmath293 in the denominator of ( [ eq : predictedg ] ) : this factor comes from @xmath213 , and its origin is simply in the definition of interaction strength from the boson - mediated coupling between two _ single _ electrons .",
    "it has no profound physical meaning , but is the part of @xmath112 which reflects our definition of particle number density , scaling as @xmath204 under transformation ( [ eq : ktransform]-[eq : ktransform2 ] ) .      for the spherically symmetric example considered , it was possible to eliminate all @xmath220 interactions on macroscopic length scales , outside of a central singularity in the @xmath220 field which became a singularity in the induced space  time",
    ". can systems exist for which this is not possible , and in which interactions with @xmath220 bosons may take place ?",
    "a possible candidate for such a system would be a perfectly symmetric , rapidly spinning stellar collapse . classically , such a system has been argued to exhibit a naked singularity : a singularity in space  time curvature without an event horizon , from which photons could apparently escape . in this theory the space ",
    "time singularity would correspond to a singularity in the induced co - ordinate frame such that interactions with the @xmath220 fields can not be completely eliminated over some region .",
    "particles entering this region could then interact with the @xmath220 field in a manner which would be detectable in the curved space  time .",
    "arguably no other , less pathological situations permitting the detection of @xmath220 bosons exist : such situations would entail obligate smooth continuation of the space ",
    "time metric in a manner not consistent with elimination of the foreground @xmath220 fields .",
    "this would imply either a sharp discontinuity in the @xmath1 and @xmath161 fields , or an asymmetry between the two .",
    "the former is penalised by an infinitely large contribution to the lagrangian , and so is unphysical , and the latter is prohibited by our final choice of gauge in sec .",
    "[ sec : lagr ] .",
    "specifically , any @xmath1 or @xmath161 boson will sustain a virtual @xmath32 or @xmath34 field respectively .",
    "even if these fields are not probed in a given feynman diagram , any asymmetry is still prohibited by ( [ eq : equalitygauge ] ) , and smooth continuation of this choice of gauge requires that the surplus particle is not a @xmath220 boson but a @xmath295 boson .",
    "ultimately this gauge transformation rotates the @xmath30 subspace at the space ",
    "time co - ordinate where the isolated @xmath220 boson would have been generated , mixing all interactions occurring at that point such that @xmath1 and @xmath220 bosons ( if any ) are produced in equal measure . thus ( [ eq : equalitygauge ] ) prohibits production of isolated @xmath1 or @xmath161 bosons , as well as permitting elimination of the right - handed weak interaction .    in conclusion , detection of @xmath220 bosons , except implicitly as the mediators of space  time curvature ,",
    "is therefore impossible outside of a naked space  time singularity , and their interactions may be safely ignored .",
    "interactions which ostensibly produce a single @xmath220 boson may still take place , for example @xmath296 but only if they are accompanied by a second reaction producing a @xmath1 boson of the opposite type at the same space  time co - ordinate , e.g. @xmath297 in fact , with @xmath112 much reduced from the standard model , the paired interactions ( [ eq : whga1]-[eq : whga2 ] ) are responsible for nearly all observed @xmath298 annihilation events .",
    "examining the @xmath47 and @xmath53 bosons in ( [ eq : whga1]-[eq : whga2 ] ) , each participates in an interaction with cross - section @xmath299 , but the diagrams are augmented by an additional factor @xmath300 corresponding to the number of available @xmath51 or @xmath103 bosons in the background fields .",
    "being unaware of the interactions between @xmath168 and @xmath220 bosons , we inadvertently conflate these processes with @xmath301 giving an apparent @xmath47@xmath53 coupling @xmath302 the effective interaction strength is augmented by the number density of the background @xmath168 fields , and by a factor of @xmath303 due to the different boson - boson interactions involved . together",
    "these effects offset the reduced value of @xmath112 in the present model , and may be compared with the role of the background photon field in sec .",
    "[ sec : em ] .",
    "a similar process enhances the strength of the @xmath295@xmath50 coupling , but no equivalent exists for the @xmath295@xmath52 coupling , which is therefore negligible in the @xmath198 regime .",
    "the above derivation of the schwarzschild metric holds only in the combined limits @xmath304 where the latter expression corresponds to @xmath233 for a body of mass @xmath305 .",
    "the former corresponds to the schwarzschild radius , indicating that this theory will predict novel physics for bodies classically presumed to collapse into black holes , and the latter corresponds to a radius below which the role of the background field becomes less significant , the net generation of @xmath220 pairs at the expense of the @xmath168 fields decreases , and the effective value of @xmath1 consequently becomes less .",
    "because these limits express different dependencies on @xmath305 , we see that for @xmath306 the physics of the theory begins to deviate from general relativity only on approaching the schwarzschild radius . for suitably compressed bodies of mass @xmath307 , however",
    ", the second limit is encountered first and there exists the tantalising prospect of observing a reduced gravitational interaction at radii less than @xmath233 . in practice this regime appears presently inaccessible , with @xmath308 being of order @xmath309  m for the threshold mass , and scaling as @xmath310 .",
    "this paper has demonstrated the existence of a renormalisable extension of the standard model which is shown to reproduce some of the behaviours of the gravitational interaction for an irrotational , spherically symmetric point mass , most notably the schwarzschild metric and the value of @xmath1 , the newtonian gravitational constant . that it is possible to construct such",
    "a theory suggests that there is profitable work on quantum gravity to be done in the low - energy limit , and that it may be possible to determine the form to which higher energy theories such as string theory must reduce .",
    "the following outcomes appear to be relatively robust properties of this theory :    * the symmetry breaking process is more involved than the minimal scalar higgs mechanism employed in the standard model . * the symmetry group of the electroweak interaction must be expanded at least to @xmath4 .",
    "* the theory incorporates non - existence of neutrinos of right - handed helicity by construction . *",
    "the neutrino is not its own anti - particle , implying non - occurrence of neutrinoless double beta decay .    that the theory is predictive of the value of @xmath1 is already a significant test of the hypothesis that this is a valid representation of the gravitational interaction at low energies",
    "undoubtedly , as the theory is explored in more detail other opportunities to test this hypothesis will arise .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that the theory includes a natural candidate for a dark matter particle , the @xmath52 boson , which has a mass similar to that of the @xmath47 and @xmath50 bosons .",
    "unfortunately no prediction can yet be made about the interaction cross - section with nucleons , which is typically probed in dark matter detection experiments , as the theory presented here does not yet incorporate the strong nuclear force .",
    "when performing computations involving boson - boson interactions , it is useful to know the structure constants for a basis of @xmath0 which corresponds to the bosons being studied . consider the basis @xmath311 which satisfies @xmath312 ( no sum over @xmath313 ) . identifying @xmath314 the non - zero structure constants for this basis are @xmath315 where @xmath316.\\ ] ]"
