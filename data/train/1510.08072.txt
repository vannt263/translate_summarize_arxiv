    "it has been shown in the lhc experiments that in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions , there is a substantial azimuthal anisotropy , quantified by the second fourier harmonics also often referred to as elliptic `` flow '' ,  @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy appears in the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath0 for two particle correlations in @xmath5 , and for pa collisions in four particle correlations @xmath6 and for higher numbers of particles @xmath7 .",
    "there is also evidence for non - zero odd harmonics of the azimuthal anisotropy , @xmath8 .",
    "these results suggest that a hydrodynamic treatment may be valid  @xcite in spite of the difficulty justifying such a description for such small systems  @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless challenging to reconcile with the observation that there is little evidence for jet quenching of particles at the same transverse momentum where particles flow  @xcite , and the fact that flow is seen at high transverse momenta where hydrodynamic descriptions are questionable .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 for two particle correlations has on the other hand been computed within the theory of the color glass condensate  @xcite , which for the lack of better terminology we will refer to as glasma graph ( gg ) .",
    "this computation assumes a continuum of sources , and is in the limit of an infinite number of sources .",
    "the result is of order @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of colors .",
    "as was later elucidated this suppression is a manifestation of bose - einstein enhancement of gluons in the target  @xcite , see also discussions in ref .",
    ". however , it has proven difficult to use gg mechanism to extract the four particle correlation @xmath6 since computations almost invariably lead to a four particle correlation that is positive corresponding to an complex @xmath6 , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "one can question the cgc treatment to date as it uses a continuum of emission sources . in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and peripheral @xmath11 collisions ,",
    "there is good evidence that the ellipticity that might drive hydrodynamic flow is generated by fluctuations in the emission from a finite number of sources  @xcite .",
    "ellipticities have been calculated that semi - quantitatively agree with extraction from hydrodynamic models of experiment .    in the systems driven by fluctuations , the ellipticities that fluctuations induce vanish in the limit of an infinite number of sources .",
    "in this limit the distribution becomes uniform .",
    "therefore the gg cgc computations will always dominate over a fluctuation induced component for sufficiently high multiplicity in the momentum domain of gg cgc applicability .",
    "nevertheless for the multiplicities experimentally accessible , one might not be in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the corresponding computation of the emission from the cgc for a finite number of sources is the subject of this paper .",
    "we will find that there are two effects needed to generate an acceptable @xmath5 .",
    "the first is the finite number of sources .",
    "we also find that we need to have a finite range color correlation length .",
    "this correlation length has been computed in the literature and shown to be of the order of the saturation momentum scale  @xcite .",
    "it arises in the evolution of gluon distribution functions . in the mclerran - venugopalan model",
    "@xcite , the length is infinite , and one does not in this way generate an acceptable @xmath0 .",
    "because the correlation length is of order @xmath12 , we will find that the characteristic momentum scale size associated with flow is the saturation momentum .",
    "again , this is a surprise since one would have naively thought that wave interference of the emitting gluons would be on a characteristic momentum scale of the inverse source size , that is @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to outline methods for the computation of @xmath7 .",
    "we explicitly compute @xmath5 , @xmath14 and @xmath6 .",
    "we restrict our computations to transverse momentum scales greater than or of the order of that of the nuclear saturation momentum .",
    "there is no difficulty in principle computing in the extended range where @xmath15 , but as a first attempt to demonstrate the method we restrict the range of momentum .",
    "we find a semi - quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured @xmath5 .",
    "the magnitude and dependence upon @xmath16 appear to be roughly in agreement with experiment for reasonable choices of our parameter .",
    "we also will show that the result factorizes for momentum scales consistent with out approximation and in accord with experimental results .",
    "it is more complicated for us to compute @xmath7 for @xmath17 .",
    "we can do this as an expansion in the inverse of the number of particles sources , and have done so for @xmath6 , and achieve an acceptable result .",
    "the computation of @xmath18 and higher is complicated and we do not explicitly compute here , although we point out the complications of such a computation .",
    "we believe that computing a non - vanishing @xmath8 should be possible using the techniques we outline here .",
    "this involves a three gluon odderon type emission , which should generate odd two particle correlations .",
    "this is an interesting quantity to compute , and we hope to return to this in a later paper .",
    "we note that present classical yang - mills simulations already indicate the presence of @xmath8 , it develops due to time evolution and non - linearity of the yang - mills equations of motion , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we caution the reader that the rough agreement we find with experimentally determined flow values is probably accidental and arises from adjusting parameters , since we expect the gg @xmath9 correction to contribute for high multiplicity events , and that final state interactions of particles need to be taken into account either through hydrodynamics or transport computations .",
    "our computation should be viewed as complementing the results from the glasma on initial conditions , and are amusing since these results the initial conditions have a good deal of collectivity , in the form of initial state flow .",
    "our computation supplements the results on initial state fluctuation driven ellipticity , and generate flow in the initial state since quantum mechanics forces non - trivial interference between the wavefunctions of particle produced from discrete sources which appear in the momentum space amplitudes .",
    "we also caution the reader that we are outlining here the beginnings of more detailed computations which allow one to extend results to wider range of momenta , correlations with larger number of particles , and hopefully for @xmath8 .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the finite correlation length for color charge in the color glass condensate .",
    "it was shown that upon evolution , there is a finite color neutralization length in the cgc  @xcite .",
    "the specific form of the propagator was shown to have an anomalous dimension , and a range of order the inverse saturation momentum scale . in the treatment we present here",
    ", we will include the finite range of color charge correlations but we will not include the effects of anomalous dimension . the inclusion of an anomalous dimension presents no problem in principle but obscures the qualitative and semi - quantitative points we wish to make .",
    "we assume that in the continuum @xmath19 where we approximate @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a free parameter of order one .",
    "equation eq .   is the simplest analytic generalization of the mclerran - venugopalan model which takes into account the color neutralization phenomena discussed in details in ref .",
    "it also in agreement with the double - logarithmic approximation of bfkl at a very high transverse momentum .    for future purpose",
