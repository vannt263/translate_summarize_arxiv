    "@xcite ( henceforth kr ) and shahbaz , charles & king ( 1998 ) ( henceforth sck ) examined the x - ray light curves of transient low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in decay , characterising them as simple exponential or linear decays . in some cases , however , the decays show a distinct knee . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] , this is not a secondary maximum in the sense that the x - ray count rate declines throughout .    in x - ray bright disc - accreting systems ,",
    "including transient lmxbs during outburst , the temperature of the accretion disc is dominated by x - ray heating from the inner accretion regions across most of the disc . for a disc in which the scale height can be described as a function of radius by @xmath0 for constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the temperature , @xmath3 , is given by @xcite as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the disc albedo , @xmath6 is the central x - ray luminosity heating the disc , assumed to be emanating radially from a small spherical source . only if @xmath7 is the whole surface of the accretion disc illuminated ; if @xmath8 ( [ eq : tofr ] ) predicts a surface temperature of zero which is invalid because of local viscous heat production .",
    "consistent with kr we adopt a value of @xmath9 , although see section  [ sec : dm2small ] .",
    "( [ eq : tofr ] ) can be rewritten to give the maximum radius @xmath10 which is heated by x - rays to the temperature @xmath11 needed to remain in the hot , viscous state .",
    "thus @xmath12 we abbreviate this equation as @xmath13 we note that especially in the case of a black hole the x - ray source will be the inner accretion disc , and as such disc - like rather than point - like .",
    "this introduces an factor of @xmath14 into the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : rhot ] ) , which is equivalent to modified values of @xmath2 and @xmath15 in ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) ; specifically , the index of @xmath16 in the l.h.s . becomes @xmath17 , and @xmath15 gains a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "however , @xmath2 and @xmath1 may differ systematically between neutron star and black hole systems , in which case the differences in ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) will be less simple .",
    "kr showed that x - ray heating during the decay from outburst causes the light curves of transient lmxbs to exhibit either exponential or linear declines depending on whether or not the luminosity is sufficient to keep the outer disc edge hot .",
    "they note that exponential decays must revert to the linear mode when the x - ray flux has decreased sufficiently , but do not analyse this in detail . nor do they consider the effects of mass transfer from the donor star , @xmath18 , during the outburst . whilst in many systems @xmath18 is negligible compared to the mass accretion rate onto the compact object , @xmath19 , during outburst , this is not necessarily the case . in this paper",
    "we consider these issues .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] contains our theoretical predictions for the decay light curve . in section  [ sec : fitting ] we identify some suitable light curves and describe their parametrization .",
    "we compare the results from the fitting in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the mass of the accretion disc during the exponential decay is given by equation 3 of kr ; @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some measure of viscosity , taken by kr to be the viscosity near the outer disc edge with a value of @xmath22 . in the case of significant mass transfer into the disc from the donor",
    "star the central accretion rate is given by @xmath23 using this to replace @xmath24 in ( [ eq : mdisc ] ) we obtain @xmath25 therefore the mass of the hot disc can be written @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the constant of integration , and the x - ray luminosity is proportional to @xmath28 at some time , @xmath29 , the temperature of the outer disc edge , while still dominated by x - ray heating , will be only just sufficient to remain in the hot , viscous state , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the corresponding x - ray luminosity as @xmath31 , with the central accretion rate @xmath32 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at earlier times is @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the efficiency with which rest mass is liberated as x - rays .",
    "when @xmath36 the outer part of the disc is no longer kept in the hot , viscous state by central irradiation .",
    "the radius of the hot part of the disc will decrease with the decreasing x - ray luminosity , corresponding to the late linear decline of kr .",
    "this , too , may be modified by the donor star mass loss rate , depending on the mass accretion rate through the now cold outer disc . designating @xmath37 as the rate at which mass is transported inwards through the cold disc",
    ", we examine the two extreme behaviours of @xmath38 . for the minimally efficient cold disc @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , and",
    "none of @xmath18 reaches the hot disc when @xmath36 . at the other extreme @xmath41 and the cold disc",
    "does not increase in surface density with time .",
    "the occurrence of outbursts suggests that the latter case is false ; with stable cold - state mass transfer , outbursts would never occur .    the mass in the hot disc changes due to three factors : accretion from its inner edge , the loss of material into the encroaching cold disc , and mass transfer from the cold disc .",
    "hence , @xmath42 using the approximate substitution from ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) that @xmath43 ( [ eq : mhotlin ] ) becomes @xmath44 additionally , equation 2 of kr allows @xmath45 to be written as @xmath46 equating ( [ eq : dmhotlin ] ) to @xmath47 ( [ eq : kr2 ] ) , @xmath48 so using equation 2 of kr , @xmath49 we now substitute the two cases of @xmath50 outlined above . when mass transfer into the hot disc is negligible , @xmath51 and the decay is the linear decline predicted by kr as expected .",
    "when @xmath52 , @xmath53 while @xmath54 this reduces to the same form .",
    "as @xmath19 decreases it will approach the limit of @xmath55 , at which point @xmath56 .",
    "the exact form of the decay will depend on the unreliably known form of @xmath37 , and during the late linear decline viscous heating near @xmath10 becomes non - negligible .",
    "we do not predict the form of the late decay other than to note that if there is some radius @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 then the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : lqui ] )",
    "will give the asymptotic limit of the decay and the accretion luminosity at the beginning of quiescence .",
    "as a final point on the linear decay we note that the viscous instability may cause a range of annuli within the cold disc to enter the hot state and rapidly transfer mass inward",
    ". some of this may enter the inner hot disc , or else may increase the surface density of the subsequent cold disc such that the inner hot disc receives more material at its outer edge .",
    "consequently , small rebrightenings or other artefacts potentially complicate the linear decay .      to examine the observed x - ray light curves of transient lmxbs it is useful to examine the constraints on the transition .",
    "the gradient of the exponential decay at time @xmath29 is @xmath59 whilst the gradient of the linear decline is given by ( [ eq : ddmc ] ) , @xmath60 from ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) we adopt @xmath61 where it is assumed that at the outer disc edge @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath63 in the case that @xmath64 is small relative to @xmath6 the gradient of the exponential decay at time @xmath29 is equal to that of the subsequent linear decline ; the first derivative of the x - ray light curve is expected to vary smoothly throughout the decay .",
    "if however @xmath64 can not be neglected then the linear decline is steeper than the exponential decay at @xmath29 and a discontinuity in gradient is expected . whether this is detectable depends on the value of @xmath18 and the quality of the x - ray data .    some x - ray light curves , including most of those discussed in this paper , include a knee feature in the decay from outburst . where this can be explained by an exponential to linear transition with non - negligible @xmath64 we label it as a ` brink ' . in general the decay light curve may contain multiple knees due to different effects , but we do not expect more than one brink unless the source rebrightens between them such that each occurs at approximately the same luminosity , corresponding to a disc not varying greatly in radius .",
    "x - ray light curves from the all - sky monitor ( asm ) and proportional counter array ( pca ) of the _ rxte _ space telescope were examined to find examples of decay light curves which fit the template predicted above .",
    "we use our analysis to determine distances and accretion disc radii .",
    "system parameters from the literature for the objects analysed are collected in table  [ tab : syspar ] for comparison with quantities we derive . since we will be calculating the radius of the accretion disc we calculate from the system parameters the orbital separation @xmath65 .",
    "the count rates @xmath66 as a function of time @xmath67 were fitted with @xmath68 for the exponential phase , where @xmath69 is the limit of the exponential decay , @xmath70 is the count rate at the brink , and @xmath71 is the time - scale of the decay .",
    "the linear decline is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the time after the brink at which the count rate would become zero if the linear decline continued . using the assumed distance to each source with a hydrogen column density of @xmath74 it is possible to convert the count rates @xmath70 and @xmath69 into absolute x - ray luminosities @xmath31 and @xmath75 , the x - ray luminosity at the brink and the limit of the exponential decay ( corresponding to @xmath18 ) respectively .",
    "for the two systems for which we have simultaneous asm and pca light curves , and , the ratio of count rates is approximately 31 .",
    "we assume this conversion to be valid for all sources for comparison purposes , and present luminosities in the 1.512@xmath76 range corresponding to the asm spectral range using an assumed power law spectrum with photon index of @xmath77 .",
    "the luminosities thus determined are given in table  [ tab : fitpar ] .",
    "we note that if the spectrum differs between systems our deduced @xmath31 is invalid , though our deduced exponential timescale will be unaffected .    using ( [ eq : rhotl ] ) and ( [ eq : roftau ] ) it is possible to calculate the disc radius independently from the measured values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; the result based on @xmath71 is of particular importance as it does not depend on the conversion of count rate to flux but only on a directly observable timescale .",
    "it is also possible to determine @xmath18 from @xmath69 .",
    "results are given in table  [ tab : calcpar ] ; for comparison we have also listed the circularization radius , @xmath78 , and the distance between the compact object and the inner lagrange point , @xmath79 , for each source based on the values in table  [ tab : syspar ] .",
    "discussion of the choice of values for @xmath15 and @xmath21 is given in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "[ [ section ] ] ~    fig .",
    "[ fig:1543 ] shows that the exponential - then - linear fit to the decay from the 2002 outburst of is significantly better than the least - squares regression line . because no discontinuity is seen in the gradient , the fitting routine used was based on the continuous derivative model ( see section  [ sec : cont ] ) .",
    "previous outbursts were reported in 1971 , 1983 and 1992 .",
    "the source therefore spends only a small fraction of its time in outburst , suggesting that @xmath18 is small compared with the central accretion rate during outburst , consistent with the source s failure to display a broken gradient .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ] ~     was first detected in outburst in 1996 and has subsequently shown outbursts in 1998 , 2000 , 2002 , and 2005 .",
    "hence it is expected that the ratio of @xmath18 to the peak central accretion rate is much higher than in .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance of a broken decay in the two well observed outbursts , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] and [ fig:1808_2002 ] .",
    "each light curve is well fitted by a decay that is exponential towards a positive limit followed by a sharp gradient discontinuity ( brink ) leading to a linear decline .",
    "the fit to the 1998 outburst includes all points that can be confirmed to occur during the decay ; the observation at day 16 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] may belong to a period of constant luminosity or even an unsteady rise to outburst , while the observations around day 33 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] may involve a rebrightening .",
    "even if this is not the case the late linear decline is expected to become increasingly complex , as we noted in section  [ sec : linear ] .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] shows that the brink occurs at approximately the same count rate in both cases .",
    "this is expected if @xmath80 remains constant ( i.e. @xmath31 is the same ) .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:1808 ] indicates the fit proposed by sck , in which they identified the surplus around the brink as a secondary maximum . we disagree and view their fit as inadequate in having a negative limit to the exponential decay .",
    "it is possible that features in other decay light curves identified as secondary maxima but having monotonically decreasing x - ray flux have the same explanation .",
    "a second issue in fig .  [ fig:1808_2002 ] is the broken nature of the light curve prior to the brink . whilst we do not have a detailed explanation for this",
    ", we speculate that it may be associated with some regions of the disc being self - shadowed and initially remaining in the cool state .",
    "3d hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show self - shadowing is likely , due to spiral density waves and irradiated disc warping ( c.f .",
    "consequently the effective area of the hot disc , the quantity probably corresponding to our measurement of @xmath81 , increases during the decay in an apparently stepwise manner , introducing new material into the hot disc and therefore resetting the central luminosity to a higher value .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that fitting the region around day 65 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] indicates a shorter exponential time - scale than from day 70 to the brink , corresponding to a smaller outer radius of the hot region . by day 70",
    "we assume that the entire disc is in the hot state .",
    "the growing irradiated area could lead to an actual increase in @xmath6 , hence it is an explanation for a type of secondary maximum .",
    "it is possible that the light curve will monotonically decline despite the growing irradiated area , hence producing knees in the light curve . the light curve of around day 67 of fig .",
    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] is suggestive of this behaviour .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ] ~     was first detected during its 2002 outburst , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1751 ] , and a second outburst was observed in 2005 .",
    "if this repetition interval is normal for the system , it indicates a ratio of @xmath18 to peak central accretion rate more similar to that of than to .",
    "consistent with this , the 2002 decay light curve has a shape similar to those of in that a smooth exponential decay is broken by occasional rebrightenings .",
    "therefore only the last portion , appearing to correspond to a single smooth decay , is fitted .",
    "the linear portion of this decay terminates at a constant level . in accordance with ( [ eq : ddmc2 ] )",
    "we interpret this as the rate at which mass can be transferred through the mostly cold disc ; this rate will continue during quiescence whilst the disc mass increases .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ] ~    a third observed example of the brink is found in the only observed ( 2002 ) outburst of . here the overall shape before the brink is exponential , but a maximum at about day 10 of fig .",
    "[ fig:0929 ] and a minimum at about day 19 are anomalous .",
    "possibly the outer edge of the disc remained cold until late in the exponential decay and several secondary maxima of the type already discussed have occurred .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ] ~     is , like , and , one of seven known milli - second pulsar ( msp ) systems .",
    "msps have short orbital periods and hence small and therefore relatively simple discs .",
    "we therefore expect the x - ray light curve of to also display the brinked decay seen in the first three .",
    "[ fig:1807 ] does not appear to lend itself to this type of fitting , and we have been unable to obtain reasonable fitting parameters .",
    "one possible explanation is that the linear decay had already begun at the start of the observed light curve ; in this case the brink count rate must be around fifty per cent greater than that seen in .",
    "the orbital separation of ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tab : syspar ] ) is half that of , so the disc must be correspondingly smaller .",
    "a high value of @xmath70 can only be accounted for if is at a distance of less than about @xmath82 so the luminosity remains low while the countrate is high .",
    "conversely , if the light curve corresponds to the exponential portion with several rebrightenings , the maximum value of @xmath70 may be 15 , with the light curve after day 80 tentatively assumed to be linear .",
    "if the disc is half the radius of that of , in proportion to the orbital separation , ( [ eq : dmhotlin ] ) indicates that the brink luminosity will be one quarter that of .",
    "the pca count rate at the proposed brink is one quarter that of , indicating a similar source distance of @xmath83 .",
    "we deem the latter explanation more likely , and suspect that the exponential decay of is complicated by self - shadowing of the disc",
    ".    the more extreme mass ratio of than , indicated in table  [ tab : syspar ] , suggests that the accretion disc radius in is a larger fraction of the orbital separation , indicating a larger brink luminosity than assumed above , increasing the distance estimates in both cases .",
    "a lower value of @xmath70 is possible in the second case , which would also indicate a greater source distance .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ] ~    the earliest part of the _ rxte _ light curve of , shown in fig .  [ fig:1744_1996 ] , shows the system already in outburst ; the first pca data are consistent with the outburst decay .",

    "[ fig:1744_1997 ] shows the decay from the 1997 outburst , in which a brink is clearly present .",
    "our confidence in the identification of these two knees as brinks is increased by their similarity in luminosity .",

    "[ fig : gx339 - 4 ] , follows an exponential decay to less than 10 per cent of its outburst maximum , a much smaller fraction than is exhibited by the other systems considered so far .",

    "[ [ section-7 ] ] ~    although not enough data exist to be able to establish the parameters of the brinked decay , a knee occurs in the pca light curve , which has been marked in fig .",

    "[ [ section-8 ] ] ~    the asm light curve of shows one outburst , starting in 1996 april and persisting until 1997 august .",
    "this outburst is broadly divided into two broad peaks , of which the decay of the second is shown .",
    "although the system had been in outburst for a considerable time , @xcite note that no stable hot disc state exists for luminosities less than the eddington luminosity ; it is therefore unclear whether material from the outer disc edge participated in the outburst . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : calcpar ] , the accretion disc radius calculated from the brink luminosity and the exponential timescale match each other , but are considerably less than the system s circularization radius .",
    "this may indicate that the mechanism examined here is applicable , but acts on a small inner disc region rather than on the disc as a whole .",
    "possibly this second peak is caused by a high surface density remnant left by the preceding outburst activity",
    ".     returned to outburst in 2005 ; if the average flux between the beginning of the two successive outbursts is taken as an indicator of @xmath18 , this value is found to lie below the brink by a factor of three .",
    "the mass transfer rate from the secondary star may be enhanced during outburst , but it is likely that the mass flow onto the ( constant radius ) outer edge of the hot disc during the exponential phase is supplied from additional disc structures rather than from the secondary directly .",
    "the complexity of the disc in this system does not necessarily invalidate the application of this model during at least some phases of the decay .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ] ~    no pca light curves for are available , so the best evidence for our model being applicable to this system comes from the asm light curve .",

    "clearly there is substantial variation in the height of the brink , which indicates variation in the radius of the disc .",
    "in order to explain this we used the asm light curve to assess the fluence of each outburst .",

    "[ fig:1808_2002 ] are both consistent with the interpretation that the outer disc edge was not in the hot state at the beginning of the decay . as such , the disc radius measured corresponds at first to a hot disc smaller than the disc as a whole , which is therefore depleted on a shorter timescale . at some point",
    "the outer disc is heated and enters the hot state .",

    "we have assumed in the initial model that the limit of the exponential decay is equal to the assumed constant mass transfer rate from the donor star .",
    "this requires that the hot disc is capable of supporting the additional mass flux @xmath18 at all times and radii .",

    "as @xmath6 decreases , a greater surface density and total mass is required to transport the same @xmath18 inward , so some of this material must be absorbed to increase the surface density . for a typical luminosity at the beginning of the exponential phase 2.5 times greater than @xmath31 the change in mass required is @xmath128 examining , for which we have the largest mean luminosity relative to @xmath31 , we find a mean long term count rate of @xmath129 , whereas the limit of the decay _ a _ for instance is @xmath130 .",
    "taken over an exponential phase duration of 57 days this makes the l.h.s . of ( [ eq : deltam ] )",
    "equivalent to @xmath131 asm units of mass . using the conversion factor from webpimms of @xmath132 @xmath133 , at a distance of @xmath134",
    "this integrated flux is equivalent to @xmath135 . using @xmath136 ( as in table  [ tab : calcpar ] ) we find @xmath137 in strong agreement with the values given in table  [ tab : calcpar ] despite the weakness of the derivation . in principle",
    "it is necessary to simultaneously derive the time and radius dependencies of @xmath104 given the outer boundary condition of @xmath138 , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a knee in the light curve of the decay from outburst of an transient lmxb is a natural consequence of mass transfer onto the outer edge of the disc , since this supply is effectively cut off from the compact object when the outer disc enters the cool low - viscosity state .",
    "when the knee can be interpreted in this way we refer to it as a brink , since knees of other types may be seen in the decay outburst .",
    "the x - ray luminosity at which the brink occurs is that at which the outer disc edge is just kept hot by central illumination , allowing this radius to be calculated .",
    "in addition , the exponential time - scale of the decay gives a second measure of the disc radius ; these two estimates are in good agreement . by examining systems with well constrained disc radii we deduced values of the constants @xmath15 and @xmath21 required to perform the calculations .",
    "this allows more accurate results to be obtained in other systems .",
    "where the source distance is poorly constrained , the timescale @xmath71 allows the absolute luminosity @xmath31 to be estimated , providing a measure of source distance .    as well as `",
    "secondary maxima ' associated with the brink , we have identified maxima whose natural explanation is the discontinuous increase in the radius of the hot disc during outburst .",
    "this increase arises from initially self - shadowed disc regions becoming irradiated .",
    "this process can occur until the whole disc is in the hot state .",
    "it is characteristic for the time - scale of the exponential decay to increase with each such maximum , and it is expected that the limit of each exponential decay will also increase .",
    "although we do not have sufficient data to examine the matter in detail , it is probable that some secondary ` maxima ' of this type will also involve monotonic decay , and therefore probably will appear as a knee in the x - ray light curve .",
    "current instrumentation is capable of measuring the light curves of x - ray transients in m31 , for example @xcite show part of a 2004 july decay of .",
    "while this light curve , with only 4 data points over 3 consecutive days , is too sparse to allow us to deduce any parameters from fitting the decay , our method could be applied to better - sampled extragalactic transient decays .",
    "since the distance is relatively well - known for objects in external galaxies , we could use our method to deduce their accretion disc radii .",
    "this would contribute to constraints on the fundamental system parameters , such as orbital separation and mass ratio , which might otherwise be impossible to determine .",
