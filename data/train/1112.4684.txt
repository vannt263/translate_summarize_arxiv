    "this is the first of a series of papers ( together with @xcite ) proposing an extension of the one dimensional renormalization theory for the case of quasi - periodic forced maps .",
    "each of these papers is self contained , but highly interrelated with the others .",
    "a more detailed exposition can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give a concrete definition of the operator to the case of quasi - periodic maps and we use it to prove the existence of reducibility loss bifurcations when the coupling parameter goes to zero , like the ones observed in @xcite for the forced logistic map . in @xcite we will use the results developed here to study the asymptotic behavior of these bifurcations when the period of the attracting set goes to infinity . our quasi - periodic extension of the renormalization operator is not complete in the sense that several conjectures must be assumed . in @xcite we include the numerical evidence which support these conjectures and we show that the theoretical results agree with the behavior observed numerically .",
    "the classic one dimensional renormalization theory was motivated to explain the cascades of period doubling bifurcations .",
    "the paradigmatic example in the case of unimodal maps is the logistic map , but the properties of renormalization and universality are also observable in a wider class of maps .",
    "concretely , given a typical one parametric family for unimodal maps @xmath1 one observes numerically that there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath2 such that the attracting periodic orbit of the map undergoes a period doubling bifurcation . between one period doubling and the next one there exists also a parameter value @xmath3 , for which the critical point of @xmath4 is a periodic orbit with period @xmath0 .",
    "one can also observe that @xmath5    moreover , the constant @xmath6 is universal , in the sense that for any family of unimodal maps with a quadratic turning point having a cascade of period doubling bifurcations , one obtains the same ratio @xmath6 .",
    "for technical reason the discussion is typically focussed around the values @xmath3 .",
    "the renormalization theory for unimodal one dimensional maps was originated by the seminal works of feigenbaum ( @xcite ) and collet and tresser ( @xcite ) who independently proposed the renormalization operator to explain the universal behavior observed in the cascades of bifurcations of one dimensional maps , see @xcite for a review .",
    "let us do a quick summary of the theory .",
    "the ( doubling ) renormalization operator , which is denoted by @xmath7 , is defined in the space of unimodal maps as the self composition of the map composed with a change of scale ( see subsection [ subsection set up 1-d renor ] for more details ) .",
    "there are some basic assumptions on the dynamics of the operator @xmath7 ( known as the feigenbaum conjectures ) which give a suitable explanation to the universality described before .",
    "the first of these conjectures is that the operator has a fixed point @xmath8 and it is differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath9 the second conjecture is that the spectrum of @xmath10 has a a unique real eigenvalue @xmath6 bigger than one , and the rest of eigenvalues are strictly smaller than one .",
    "then one has that the unstable manifold @xmath11 has dimension one and the stable manifold @xmath12 has codimension one .    on the other hand , one has that the values @xmath13 where the critical point of a map @xmath4 has period @xmath0 correspond to the parameter values where the family @xmath14 intersects certain codimension one manifolds @xmath15 .",
    "moreover one has that @xmath16 .",
    "the third conjecture claims that these manifolds intersect transversally @xmath11 .",
    "then one has that they accumulate to @xmath12 with ratio @xmath6 in a neighborhood @xmath17 of @xmath8 .",
    "then , for any one dimensional family @xmath1 intersecting @xmath18 transversally , the family has a sequence @xmath19 of parameters where the critical point of the map @xmath4 is periodic with period @xmath0 .",
    "hence , applying the @xmath20-lemma , this parameter values satisfy the asymptotic behavior given by the equation ( [ universal limit sumicon ] ) , with @xmath6 the unstable eigenvalue of @xmath10 .    the first proofs of the feigenbaum conjectures",
    "were done with computer assistance ( @xcite ) .",
    "later on completely conceptual proofs appeared ( @xcite ) , all of them for the case of analytic maps . for studies of the operator in the @xmath21 context",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our extension to the quasi - periodic case does not cover all the theory exposed in the cited works .",
    "the paradigmatic example in this paper is the forced logistic map ( flm for short ) .",
    "nevertheless the obtained results are applicable to a wider class of maps .",
    "the flm is a map in the cylinder @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are parameters and @xmath25 a fixed diophantine number .",
    "the dynamics on the periodic component is a rigid rotation and the dynamics on the real component is the logistic map plus a perturbation depending on the periodic one .",
    "sometimes the flm is also defined with @xmath26 .",
    "the results in this paper applies to both cases .",
    "the flm map appears in the literature in different contexts , usually related with the destruction of invariant curves , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "concretely , we are interested on the truncation of the period doubling cascade .",
    "as discussed above , the logistic map exhibits an infinite cascade of period doubling bifurcations which leads to chaotic behavior . for zero coupling ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "these periodic orbits become invariant curves of the flm ( provided the rotation number @xmath25 is irrational ) .",
    "but when the coupling parameter is different from zero , the number of period doubling bifurcations of the invariant curves is finite .",
    "we studied numerically this phenomenon in @xcite .",
    "concretely , we computed some bifurcation diagrams in terms of the dynamics of the attracting set , taking into account different properties , as the lyapunov exponent and , in the case of having a periodic invariant curve , its period and its reducibility . in the case of analytic maps in the cylinder",
    ", the reducibility loss of an invariant curve can be characterized as a bifurcation ( see definition 2.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "but the reducibility loss is not a bifurcation in the classical sense because there are not visible changes in the phase space , only the spectral properties of the transfer operator associated to the continuation of that curve changes ( see @xcite ) . despite of this",
    ", we will consider it as a bifurcation for the rest of this paper .",
    "the numerical computations in the cited work reveal that the parameter values for which the invariant curve doubles its period are contained in regions of the parameter space where the invariant curve is reducible . as before , let @xmath3 be the parameter values where the critical point of the uncoupled family is periodic with period @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical computations also revealed that from every parameter value @xmath28 two curves are born .",
    "these curves correspond to a reducibility - loss bifurcation of the @xmath0-periodic invariant curve .",
    "the scenario is sketched in figure [ esquema bifpar ] .",
    "assume that these two curves can be locally expressed as @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "in theorem [ thm existence of non - reducibility direction ] we prove that these curves really exist for suitable families of maps .",
    "moreover , we give the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in terms of the iterates of the renormalization operator . to achieve this result we need to assume that the quasi - periodic renormalization operator is injective .",
    "this assumption will be called conjecture * [ conjecture h2 ] * which is stated in section [ section boundaris of reducibility ] .",
    "this conjecture will be supported numerically in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ section definition and basic properties ]",
    "we propose a definition for the q.p .",
    "renormalization operator and we study the operator as a map on the banach space of q.p",
    ". forced unimodal maps . among other results ,",
    "we prove that the fixed point of the one dimensional renormalization operator extends to the quasi - periodic one and we compute and study its derivative . in section [ chapter application ]",
    "we consider certain codimension one manifolds , which correspond to the bifurcation manifold associated to the reducibility loss of the @xmath0 periodic invariant curve of the system .",
    "we relate these manifolds for different values of @xmath34 by means of the renormalization operator .",
    "then we consider a generic two parametric family such that it becomes a full family of renormalizable one dimensional maps when one of its parameters is equal to zero .",
    "we use the q.p .",
    "renormalization theory to prove the existence of reducibility loss bifurcations for the family .",
    "we also include an appendix where we analyze the minimum function as a functional operator from the space of functions @xmath35 to @xmath36 , which is necessary for our discussion .",

    "but in this work we focus on the simplest case of analytic functions .",
    "let us remark that , in this section , no additional assumptions will be done on @xmath25 .",
    "the aim of this section is to define the quasi - periodic renormalization operator .",
    "as long as the dynamics of the map @xmath41 is not considered , it is not necessary any additional requirement on @xmath25 . in section [ chapter application ]",
    "we will require @xmath25 to be diophantine .",
    "but for this section it is advantageous to define the operator for any @xmath42 , since then the operator will depend continuously on @xmath25 .",

    "we introduce here the precise definition of the one dimensional renormalization operator .",
    "the approach chosen here is due to its simplicity , which makes easier to adapt to the quasi periodic case .",
    "concretely we follow @xcite , but we do a slight modification on the domain of the operator for technical reasons . for a set up in a much more general context see @xcite and for more recent works on renormalization of one - dimensional maps see @xcite and @xcite .    for the understanding of this section it is advisable to have some familiarity with the definition of the ( doubling ) renormalization operator given in @xcite .",
