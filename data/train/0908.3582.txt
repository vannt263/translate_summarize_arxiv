    "in 1978 fisher and de gennes @xcite realized that when thermal fluctuations are restricted by a container a force acts on the walls of the container . since this effect is similar to the casimir effect , where the restriction of quantum fluctuations induces a force , it is called `` thermodynamic '' casimir effect . since thermal fluctuations only extend to large scales in the neighbourhood of a continuous phase transitions it is also called `` critical '' casimir effect . recently",
    "this effect has attracted much attention , since it could be verified for various experimental systems and quantitative predictions could be obtained from monte carlo simulations of spin models @xcite .",

    "the phase transition of this model belongs to the xy universality class in three dimensions .",
    "also the @xmath1-transition of @xmath12he shares this universality class .",

    "the thermodynamic casimir force in thin films of @xmath12he has been measured @xcite .",
    "these experiments confirm that the thermodynamic casimir force for films of different thickness @xmath6 can indeed be described by the same scaling function @xmath11 .",

    "for @xmath48 we get the exactly solvable gaussian model . for @xmath49",
    "the model undergoes a second order phase transition that belongs to the xy universality class .",
    "numerically , using monte carlo simulations and high - temperature series expansions , it has been shown that there is a value @xmath50 , where leading corrections to scaling vanish .",
    "numerical estimates of @xmath51 given in the literature are @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 @xcite and most recently @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "since @xmath56 is not exactly equal to @xmath51 , there are still corrections @xmath19 , although with a small amplitude . in fact , following @xcite , it should be by at least a factor 20 smaller than for the standard xy model .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) @xmath25 does not multiply the second term . therefore , strictly speaking",
    ", @xmath25 is not the inverse of @xmath58 . in order to study universal quantities",
    "it is not crucial how the transition line in the @xmath25-@xmath1 plane is crossed , as long as this path is not tangent to the transition line .",
    "therefore , following computational convenience , we vary @xmath25 at fixed @xmath1 . in the following equations",
    "it is understood that @xmath1 is kept fixed .",
    "the reduced free energy density is defined as @xmath59 \\;.\\ ] ] note that compared with the free energy density @xmath60 , a factor @xmath58 is skipped . for convenience",
    "we have defined the reduced free energy such that @xmath61 . for @xmath62",
    "the partition function factorizes and thus @xmath63 does not depend on the system size .",
    "we define the ( internal ) energy density as the derivative of the reduced free energy density with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , to be consistent with our previous work e.g. @xcite , we multiply by @xmath64 : @xmath65 it follows @xmath66 which can be easily determined in monte carlo simulations . from eqs .",
    "( [ fdef1],[edef1 ] ) it follows that the free energy density can be computed as @xmath67",
    "from a thermodynamic point of view , the casimir force per unit area is given by @xmath68 where @xmath6 is the thickness of the film and @xmath69 is the reduced excess free energy per area of the film . in lattice models",
    "the thickness @xmath6 assumes only integer values .",
    "therefore we have to approximate the derivative by a finite difference @xmath70 , where @xmath71 where @xmath72 is integer . @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the reduced free energies of films of the thicknesses @xmath72 and @xmath75 , respectively , and @xmath76 is the reduced free energy density of the three - dimensional bulk system .",
    "the main numerical task is to compute the difference of the reduced free energy per area for films of the thickness @xmath75 and @xmath72 .    in order to compute this difference ,",
    "it is useful to have the same number of field - variables for both systems . to this end",
    ", we add @xmath77 isolated sites to the film of the thickness @xmath75 .",
    "isolated means that the field @xmath78 at such a site is subject to the potential @xmath79 but the interaction with other sites is missing . using our definition  ( [ fdef1 ] ) , adding isolated sites to the film does not change the free energy per area . let us denote the partition function of this system by @xmath80 .",
    "now we can express the difference of the reduced free energies as @xmath81 \\exp(-h_{l_0 + 1/2 } )    \\exp(-\\beta \\sum_{<x , y > \\in [ l_0 + 1/2 ] }   \\vec{\\phi}_x \\vec{\\phi}_y ) }               { \\mbox{d}[\\phi ] \\exp(-h_{l_0 + 1/2 } ) } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\log \\ ; \\left \\langle    \\exp(-\\beta \\sum_{<x , y > \\in [ l_0 + 1/2 ] }   \\vec{\\phi}_x \\vec{\\phi}_y )        \\right   \\rangle_{l_0 + 1/2 }   \\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 $ ] denotes the sum over all nearest neighbour pairs , where at least one of the sites is an element of the layer @xmath83 .",
    "formally we have rewritten the difference of free energies as an expectation value .",
    "the problem is that the observable is strongly fluctuating and therefore it is impossible to obtain an accurate estimate from a monte carlo simulation of the film of the thickness @xmath72 .",
    "a well known method to overcome this problem is the so called `` multistage sampling '' strategy ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this means that a sequence of systems is introduced that interpolates between the two we are interested in .",
    "these systems are characterized by the hamiltonians @xmath84 , where we identify @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "now we can rewrite the ratio of partition functions as @xmath87 where we can write the factors as @xmath88 and hence @xmath89 if the sequence is properly chosen and @xmath90 sufficiently large , the fluctuations of @xmath91 are small and the expectation value can be accurately determined from the simulation of the system @xmath92 . and @xmath92 .",
    "] obviously there is much freedom in the construction of the sequence of systems .",
    "a straight forward one is given by @xmath93 }   \\vec{\\phi}_x \\vec{\\phi}_y   \\;.\\ ] ] this choice is very similar to the one used by @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that these authors did consider as starting system a film of thickness @xmath75 plus a two - dimensional system of the size @xmath77 .",
    "this means that in contrast to our choice the intra - layer couplings are switched on .",
    "here we use a different interpolation .",
    "it is inspired by a method used to compute the string tension and t hooft loops in lattice gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we add the isolated sites one by one to the film . in the step",
    "@xmath94 the site @xmath95 is added .",
    "all sites that are added are coupled with their nearest neighbours that are already in the film . this way we have constructed a sequence of @xmath96 systems .",
    "hence , @xmath77 independent monte carlo simulations have to be performed to obtain @xmath97 .",
    "following @xcite this can however be avoided : with increasing @xmath98 the sum  ( [ sumf ] ) is dominated by contributions where the newly added site is far from the boundaries in 1 and 2-direction . hence most of the contributions are essentially equal to that for @xmath99 and @xmath100 as sketched in figure [ lat ] . in the limit @xmath101 , this should become exact .",
    "hence only a single simulation for @xmath99 and @xmath100 is required .",
    "usually updates are performed on the whole lattice before a measurement of the observables is performed .",
    "however in the present case , the observable is localized at a single site .",
    "therefore the effort for the measurement and the update would be highly unbalanced . to circumvent this problem",
    ", one would like to update the fields in the neighbourhood of this site more frequently than those far off . in order to achieve this",
    "we follow the idea presented in @xcite : we consider a sequence of sub - sets of the sites of the lattice . here , the smallest set consists of the site @xmath102 only .",
    "the next larger one consists of @xmath102 and its three neighbours @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the larger ones are given by blocks of the size @xmath106 and @xmath107 if @xmath108 .",
    "these blocks are centred around the site @xmath102 . if @xmath109 , the eight corners of these blocks are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in our simulations",
    "we have used @xmath117 , where the largest @xmath118 is chosen such that @xmath119 .    in a certain sequence , metropolis and overrelaxation sweeps over these sub - sets are performed .",
