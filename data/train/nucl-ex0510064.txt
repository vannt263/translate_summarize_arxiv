    "flow induces a strong correlation between particles velocities and emission points leading to an effective decrease of measured hbt radii and different average emission points for particle species with non - equal masses  @xcite .",
    "therefore non - identical correlations can be used as an independent cross - check of flow measurements in heavy - ion collisions .",
