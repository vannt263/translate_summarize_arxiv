    "this builds up approximately half the nuclides from fe to bi , in particular feeding the elements sr - y - zr , ba - la - ce - pr - nd , and pb , which define the three major abundance @xmath1-peaks .",

    ".  1961 ; seeger et al .  1965 ) , the @xmath1-process abundance distribution in the solar system has been recognized as arising from a non - unique site .",
    "at least three components have been required : the _ main _ , the _ weak _ , and the _ strong _ @xmath1-component ( clayton & ward 1974 ; kppeler et al .",
    "1982 ; kppeler , beer , & wisshak  1989 ) .",
    "the _ main _ @xmath1-component , accounting for the @xmath1-process isotopic distribution in the atomic mass number range 90  @xmath10  a  @xmath10  208 , was shown to occur in low - mass ( @xmath17 4 @xmath18 ) asymptotic giant branch stars ( hereafter agb ) during recurrent thermal instabilities developing above the he - burning shell ( see busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 for a review ) .",

    "the @xmath3c source plays the major role for the main @xmath1-component . at tdu , the h - rich envelope and the he intershell coming into contact favors the penetration of a small amount of protons into the top layers of the he- and c - rich zones . at hydrogen re - ignition , protons",

    "the _ weak _ @xmath1-component , responsible for a major contribution to the @xmath1-process nuclides up to a @xmath23 90 , has been recognized as the result of neutron capture synthesis in advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars .",

    "recently , thompson , burrows , & meyer  ( 2001 ) argued that it may be difficult to achieve the necessary high entropy and short timescales in the ejecta in order to reproduce the solar system @xmath2-process abundance distribution . a second possibility is related to the merging of two neutron stars in a binary system and has been examined by freiburghaus , rosswog , & thielemann  ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , qian  ( 2000 ) argued that the predicted amount of @xmath2-process ejecta in metal - poor stars would be too high in @xmath2-elements with @xmath33 130 and with @xmath34 130 as compared with spectroscopic abundances of metal - poor stars and that the event rate would be too low .",
    "the third possibility relies upon asymmetric explosions of massive stars and jet - like outflows in the nascent neutron star ( leblanc & wilson  1970 ; cameron  2001 ,  2003 ) .",
    "each of these proposed sites faces major problems , including reaching the required physical conditions without ad hoc assumptions to produce a satisfactory fit to the solar system @xmath2-process pattern .",
    "hence , the stellar source for @xmath2-process abundances is still a matter of debate .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that at least two different supernova sources are required for the synthesis of @xmath2-process nuclei below and beyond the neutron magic number n = 82 ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino  1996 ; sneden et al .",

    "neutron - capture elements observed in pop .",
    "ii field stars are generally interpreted in an observational framework developed more than 20 years ago .",
    "spite & spite  ( 1978 ) first demonstrated that observations of ba ( a predominantly , 80% , @xmath1-process element in solar system material ) and eu ( an @xmath2-element , 95% , in the solar system ) exhibit a non - solar abundance pattern in unevolved halo stars , with [ eu / ba ] @xmath4 0 .",
    "this was interpreted by truran  ( 1981 ) as evidence of an @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis signature at low metallicities , with little evidence for @xmath1-process contributions .",
    "observational support for this view has grown both in large - sample surveys ( e.g. , gilroy et al .",
    "1988 ; mcwilliam et al . 1995 ) and in detailed analyses of several ultra - metal - poor ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath35 @xmath362.5 ) @xmath2-process - rich stars ( e.g. , sneden et al .",

    "the abundances of the heavier @xmath0-capture elements ( z  @xmath37  56 ) in such stars often is an excellent match to a scaled solar - system @xmath2-process distribution ( e.g. , cowan et al .",
    "2002 ) , but @xmath0-capture abundances of lighter elements below ba often show significant departures from this distribution .",

    "i stars .",
    "a detailed @xmath2- and @xmath1-process decomposition can be obtained for the solar system , based on the experimental knowledge of neutron capture cross sections and on the isotopic analysis of meteoritic samples that best represent the protosolar nebula composition .",

    "investigations into the chemical composition of matter at different epochs can only be accomplished through high - resolution stellar spectroscopic abundance studies .",
    "although the correlation of metallicity with time is hardly perfect , stars with sub - solar metallicities are tracers of the chemical compositions of the gas at different times of evolution of the galaxy .",
    "elemental @xmath0-capture abundances of field galactic stars at different metallicities show two main characteristics : first , an average trend to lower [ x / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] ; second , a dispersion in [ x / fe ] that increases with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "theorists have argued that the large dispersions arise from local chemical inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium of heavy elements ( in particular ba , eu and sr ) , due to incomplete mixing of the gas in the galactic halo ( see tsujimoto , shigeyama , & yoshii  1999 ; ikuta & arimoto  1999 ; raiteri et al .",

    "5 we first discuss how the main @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis in agb stars reproduces a major fraction of the solar isotopic compositions of sr - y - zr by following their enrichment throughout the galactic history .",

    "in particular , we make use of the spectroscopic observations in extremely @xmath2-process - rich and very metal - poor stars , like cs 22892 - 052 , to infer the @xmath2-process fraction of sr , y , zr that is strictly related to the main @xmath2-process feeding the heavy elements beyond ba .",

    "this has been done for both galactic halo and disk metallicities and for a wide range of @xmath3c pocket efficiencies ( see travaglio et al .  1999 , 2001a for applications of these techniques to heavier @xmath0-capture elements , with z",

    "langer et al .  1999 ; cristallo et al .  2001 ) , the mass involved and the profile of the @xmath3c - pocket must still be considered as free parameters , given the difficulty of a sophisticated treatment of the hydrodynamical behavior at the h / he discontinuity during each tdu episode . however , a series of constraints have been obtained by comparing spectroscopic abundances in @xmath1-enriched stars ( ms , s , c , post - agb , ba and ch stars ) at different metallicities with agb model predictions ( see e.g. , busso et al .  1995 ,  2001 ; abia et al .",

    "these authors conclude that the observations in general confirm the complex dependence of neutron captures on metallicity .",

    "in our calculations , the intrinsic spread in the @xmath1-process yields at each metallicity has been modeled parametrically by varying the @xmath3c concentration in the pocket from 0 up to a factor of 1.5@xmath22 the ` standard ' value of @xmath54 @xmath22 10@xmath38 @xmath18  of @xmath3c ( gallino et al .  1998 ; their st case ) . note that a maximum abundance of @xmath3c is expected in the pocket . indeed , too high a concentration of protons , that may diffuse into the top layers of the pocket , would activate the concurring reaction @xmath3c(p ,  @xmath39)@xmath24n ( with @xmath24n acting as a strong neutron poison ) .",

    "the neutrons released by the @xmath3c source in the pocket and by the @xmath6ne source in the tp are captured by the primary @xmath6ne and their progenies @xmath45 mg , which act contemporaneously as neutron poisons and as seeds for the production of the heavy @xmath1-elements ( see discussion in busso et al . 1999 ) . as a consequence , at very low metallicities the pb yield levels off instead of further decreasing .",
    "this complex behavior of @xmath1-process production is extremely important in a gce study .",

    "the thin - disk is formed from material falling in from the thick - disk and the halo .",

    "first , the spectral lines all of these elements used in analyses of metal - poor field stars have been subject to extensive laboratory analyses . therefore , their transition probabilities have small uncertainties .",
    "second , almost all sr , y , and zr abundance results are from ionized transitions of these elements . thus , abundance inter - comparisons among these elements , or comparisons with abundances of rare - earth elements ( also derived from ionized transitions ) have , in most cases , little dependence on choices of effective temperatures or gravities in the various studies included here . but each of these elements has some particular problems that should be kept in mind .",
    "strontium abundances are based almost exclusively on the very strong 4077 , 4215    resonance lines .",
    "abundances derived from these transitions are very sensitive to the choice of ( in particular ) the microturbulent velocity parameter , which can vary from analysis to analysis for the same star .",
    "additionally , these lines suffer some blending from other atomic and molecular transitions , and abundance analyses really ought to be done with synthetic spectrum computations rather than with the more common single - line equivalent width computations .",
    "fortunately in the rare spectra that have detectable ( much weaker ) higher - excitation lines and the 4607    line , the abundances derived from all sr features are in reasonable agreement ( e.g. , sneden et al .",
    "2003a ) , confirming the reliability of the resonance lines , given care in their analyses .",
    "second , yttrium and zirconium abundances usually are derived from a few lines of the ionized species of these elements .",
    "none of these lines is usually strong enough for microturbulent velocity uncertainties to be an important source of abundance uncertainty .",
    "this comes at a price : such lines of moderate strength in stars of moderate metal - deficiency weaken to undetectable levels in the most metal - poor stars , and thus y and zr abundances can not be used to constrain gce models below [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 3 .",
    "abundances of these three elements have been reported for globular cluster giant stars .",
    "however , comparisons between field and cluster abundances should be done cautiously , because the vast majority of field star abundances are obtained from blue - uv region spectra ( where the stronger lines are ) , while cluster star spectra abundances are based on lines in yellow - red spectral region ( where the fluxes are largest in these faint stars ) .",
    "unfortunately , lines are few and very weak in the yellow - red , resulting in few sr abundance determinations in clusters .",
    "furthermore , the results for y and zr are so spotty that for the present study we have chosen not to make a detailed comparison with globular clusters .",
    "exceptions are three giant stars in m15 ( see discussion below ) .    however , a few general remarks about heavier @xmath0-capture elemental abundances in globular clusters are appropriate here .",
    "first , note that the cluster metallicity range is [ fe / h ]  @xmath59 2.4 , i.e , there are no ultra - metal - poor galactic globular clusters . in this metallicity regime",
    "the clusters have [ eu / fe ]  @xmath60 + 0.4 ( @xmath61=  0.1 ) , mostly with little star - to - star variations within individual clusters and very small cluster - to - cluster differences ( see the review of sneden et al .  2003b , and references therein ) .",
    "this overall eu enhancement is comparable to the general level in field stars of the same metallicities .",
    "abundances of ba and la in clusters exhibit more intra- and inter - cluster variation , with an unweighted mean value [ ba , la / fe ]  @xmath60 + 0.1 ( @xmath61=  0.2 ) . combining this ratio with the mean eu abundance discussed above yields [ eu / ba , la ]  @xmath5 + 0.3 for almost all well - observed globular clusters .",
    "this in turn suggests strongly that the heavier @xmath0-capture elements in globular clusters have been synthesized more heavily by the @xmath2-process than by the @xmath1-process , compared with the solar system composition of these elements .",
    "therefore , in general terms , the @xmath0-capture elements in globular clusters were formed from the same enrichment episodes as was the halo field .",
    "there are a few important exceptions to these general statements about globular cluster @xmath0-capture elements .",
    "for example , in m4 , a globular cluster with metallicity [ fe / h ] = @xmath361.2 , the @xmath1-process elements ba and la are enhanced significantly beyond their nominal levels , e.g. , [ eu / ba , la ]  @xmath5 0.0 ( ivans et al .",
    "this is very clear evidence for the extra presence of the products of agb star @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis , but why this has occurred in m4 and not in most other clusters ( e.g. , not in the similar - metallicity cluster m5 ; ivans et al .",
    "2001 ) is not well understood . and in m15 ( one of the most metal - poor clusters , [ fe / h ]  @xmath60 2.4 )",
    ", a star - to - star scatter is found with a range of 0.5  dex , well beyond observational uncertainties ( sneden et al .",
    "1997 , johnson & bolte  2002 ) .    only a few stars of globular clusters have been subjected to a very detailed @xmath0-capture abundance analysis . as one example , sneden et al .",
    "( 2000b ) obtained blue - region spectra of three giants in m15 .",
    "their representative points are shown in the various figures as big open triangles .",
    "the relative @xmath0-capture abundances from this study showed good agreement with abundances of these elements in so - called @xmath2-process - rich field stars , i.e. , @xmath10[eu / fe]@xmath4  @xmath60 + 0.80 and @xmath10[ba / eu]@xmath4  @xmath60 0.85 .",
    "the [ eu / fe ] values indicate enhanced @xmath0-capture elemental abundances in these low metallicity giants , while the [ ba / eu ] ratios are consistent with an @xmath2-process solar system abundance value . both sets of elemental abundance ratios in the globular giants support other studies , based upon field halo giants , that demonstrate first the early onset of the @xmath2-process in the galaxy and",
    "second the dominance of the @xmath2-process ( as opposed to the @xmath1-process ) in the early galactic synthesis of @xmath0-capture elements .",
    "yttrium and zirconium ( but not strontium ) abundances were also derived in these stars , and the mean values were @xmath10[y / fe]@xmath4  @xmath60 0.30 and @xmath10[zr / fe]@xmath4  @xmath60 + 0.40 .",
    "these values , being both higher and lower than solar , are suggestive of different synthesis histories for y and zr , at least , than for the heavier @xmath0-capture elements , i.e. , ba and eu .    at typical galactic disk metallicities , the largest data set for zr and y abundances in field stars",
    "is that of edvardsson et al .",
    "the abundances from gratton & sneden  ( 1994 ) and fulbright  ( 2000 ) agree well with those numbers at similar metallicities .",
    "a first look at these higher metallicity data reveals a puzzle .",
    "the average trend of [ zr / fe ] and [ y / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] ( not enough [ sr / fe ] data are available at high metallicity ) are flat within the observational errors .",
    "however , at [ fe / h ] @xmath620.6 , the ratio [ zr / fe ] seems to increase slightly with decreasing [ fe / h ] , while [ y / fe ] seems to decrease slightly with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",

    "( 2000 ) data , and becoming even more obvious at halo metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath622 ) , the sr - y - zr abundances are characterized by a large [ x@xmath63/fe ] dispersion of @xmath59 2  dex ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; gratton & sneden 1994 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) .",

    "we recall that the @xmath0-component operating at very low metallicities is mainly due to explosive nucleosynthesis .",

    "the fractional contributions to sr - y - zr from this lepp are reported in the last column of table  4 . in table  4 ( column 3 ) we also report for comparison purposes the @xmath2-fraction obtained with the @xmath2-residuals method . in the case of nb , since its abundance results from the radiogenic decay of @xmath66zr , we have adopted the same contribution estimated for zr . therefore , knowing its total @xmath1-process contribution to solar nb , we have deduced the @xmath2-fraction without relying on the still uncertain observed value of [ nb / fe ] .",
    "we also warn the reader on the mo @xmath2-fraction derived from the same star , due to difficulties in detecting mo in low - metallicity stars ( see discussion in sneden et al .  2003a , where the error bar for the mo abundance in cs  22892 - 052 has been estimated to be @xmath50.2 dex ) .    in table  5",
    "we derive from cs  22892 - 052 the @xmath2-fraction of elements from ru to cd strictly based on the production of the heavy @xmath2-elements beyond ba . in the case of ru",
    "a @xmath74-process contribution ( to @xmath8ru and @xmath75ru ) has been taken into account , affecting the solar ru by @xmath57% .",
    "these elements are not the subject of this work , and therefore we will not enter into a detailed discussion here . since cd in the cs  22892 - 052 is an upper limit we report in parenthesis the @xmath2-fraction derived for that element in this star .",
    "the discrepancy in the @xmath2-fraction of sr - y - zr between the @xmath2-residuals method and the cs22892 - 052 abundances becomes even larger for elements from ru to cd  the weak @xmath1-process does not contribute to elements from ru to cd .",
    "as noted in the introduction , this discrepancy suggests an even more complex multisource nucleosynthetic origin for elements like ru , rh , pd , ag , and cd .    in fig .",
    "9 the @xmath0-capture abundance pattern observed in the ultra - metal - poor star cs  22892 - 052 is compared with the @xmath2-process abundance curve obtained by computing the galactic chemical evolution of @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis from agb stars , and using the @xmath2-process residuals method to infer the @xmath2-process fractions .",
    "exceptions are the @xmath2-process contributions to sr , y , zr , nb , and mo , for which we derived the @xmath2-process fraction from cs  22892 - 052 .",
    "the values plotted in fig .  9 correspond to the ones reported in table  4 , column 4 . even when we derived the @xmath2-fraction for sr , y , zr , nb and mo from the cs  22892 - 052 , small differences between our theoretical prediction and the observational data are still visible .",
    "this is due to observational uncertainties affecting the data ( e.g. , deriving the @xmath2-fraction using eu instead of ba will results in differences up to 5% for the elements from sr to mo ) .",
    "spectroscopic data of the elemental abundances in cs  22892 - 052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2003a ) plotted in fig .",
    "9 are the result of an average between ground - based observations and hst observations ( with the exception of pb ) . for pb",
    "both ground - based data as well as hst data have been plotted . for au",
    "no ground - based data are available , therefore only hst data have been plotted . except for pb , all hst data ( ge , y , os , pt , au",
    ", pb ) seem to be consistent with the ground - based data . concerning pb , the uncertainties are still significant even in the ground - based data , as sneden et al .",
    "( 2003a ) commented in their work `` ... we are not confident of the suggested detections of two lines in the ground - based spectra . ''",
    "we note that for nb and mo the observational error bars plotted are ` adopted error bars ' ( see sneden et al .",
    "2003a for discussion ) .",
    "we also added error bars to our theoretical gce predictions .",
    "they are based , for each isotope , on uncertainties in the solar system elemental abundances ( anders & grevesse  1989 ) , and on the uncertainties in neutron capture cross sections ( bao et al .",
    "these error bars are important for elements belonging to the three @xmath1-peaks , and in particular for pb . in the case of la ,",
    "we have adopted a conservative 2@xmath61 uncertainty , since discrepant experimental determinations of the neutron cross section are reported in the compilation of bao et al .",
    "in fig .  10 , we show the galactic evolutionary trends predicted by our model for [ sr / fe ] , [ y / fe ] , [ zr / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "these predictions take into account the @xmath1-process , the @xmath2-process and the primary process ( or lepp ) , in the halo , thick - disk and thin - disk . in fig .",
    "10 also the gce model predictions for the @xmath1-process contribution by agb stars alone are reported . for galactic disk metallicities , in the predicted total ( @xmath1 + @xmath2 + @xmath76 ) average trend one can distinguish the effect of the late agb contribution , and also a tiny difference in the relative behavior of sr , y and zr at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xmath360.3 .",
    "it is tempting to interpret in this manner the different trends observed in [ zr / fe ] and [ y / fe ] in disk metallicity stars as described in the introduction .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis would be needed when comparing results of different authors in order to distinguish intrinsic abundance variations from observational uncertainties .    in fig .",
    "11 we show the predicted trends for [ sr / y ] , [ sr / zr ] and [ y / zr ] versus [ fe / h ] , and in fig .",
    "12 the predicted trends for [ sr / ba ] , [ y / ba ] , [ zr / ba ] versus [ fe / h ] . in particular",
    ", we focus on the ratio of sr , y , zr over ba for the following reason .",
    "ba , as discussed previously , at low metallicity is mainly produced by @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "_ if _ ba and sr - y - zr would derive from the same stellar source at such low metallicities , we would expect to see a fairly flat ratio vs. [ fe / h ] ( within observational error bars ) , as in the case of [ ba / eu ] ( see travaglio et al .",
    "1999 for further discussion ) .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for sr - y - zr , suggesting a different stellar origin for sr - y - zr and ba .    at very low metallicity",
    "the increasing [ sr , y , zr / ba ] ratio with decreasing [ fe / h ] is correlated with the delayed production of ba with respect to sr - y - zr .",
    "this assumes that at low metallicity ba is produced in type ii supernovae in the mass range 8 @xmath36 10 @xmath58 , while sr - y - zr derive their @xmath0-component from all massive stars .",
    "the @xmath2-fraction alone is shown in fig .",
    "12 as a flat line in the three panels , which is consistent with the values for the two extremely @xmath2-process - rich stars cs  22892 - 052 and cs",
    "31082 - 001 .",
    "there have been recent observations of @xmath0-capture elements in nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( shetrone et al .",
    "2001 ,  2003 ) .",
    "abundance comparisons in these galaxies , as a function of metallicity , demonstrate similar patterns to those observed in the galaxy . from the shetrone et al .",
    "data for ba and eu ( our fig .  5 )",
    "we note that the abundance scatter present in [ ba / fe ] and [ eu / fe ] for [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath361.5 disappears at increasing metallicities , in a manner similar to the galactic sample .",
    "such an agreement among these various galaxies suggests a common synthesis history for these elements as a function of iron production .",
    "nevertheless , the [ y / fe ] in dwarf galaxies stars with @xmath362 @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath361 seems on average lower than what is observed in the galaxy ( fig .  4 and fig .",
    "the same is true for the ratio [ y / ba ] ( fig .  7 and fig .  12 ) .",
    "of course the stellar sample in dwarf galaxies is still too low to draw any final conclusions .",
    "moreover , no data for sr and zr are available , and different star formation histories for each dwarf galaxy should be carefully taken into account ( tolstoy et al .",
    "in spite of these intricacies , one possible explanation for the observed lower [ y / fe ] and [ y / ba ] ratios in dsph galaxies is that less ejecta from massive stars are retained in the local interstellar medium , consequently reducing the contribution to y from a primary process ( see discussion in this paper ) . summing up",
    ", an increase in the small number statistics of stars observed in dsph galaxies , as well as additional data for sr and zr in dsph stars , will allow us to better understand the nucleosynthesis history in these galaxies .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the evolution of the light @xmath0-capture elements , sr , y , and zr .",
    "the input stellar yields for these nuclei have been separated into their @xmath1- , @xmath2- , and primary - process components .",
    "the @xmath1-yields are the result of post - process nucleosynthesis calculations based on full evolutionary agb models computed with the franec code .",
    "spectroscopic observations of very low - metallicity stars in the galaxy , as well as the first observations of single stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , suggest that an extra source ( of primary nature ) is needed to synthesize sr , y , and zr , to enrich the early interstellar medium , and to reproduce the solar composition of @xmath1-only isotopes like @xmath7sr , @xmath8mo .",
    "we therefore think that neutrons should give the major imprint to this primary process , that has to be considered different from the ` classical @xmath1 ' and the ` classical @xmath2 ' processes .",
    "the results of the galactic evolution model confirm these observational indications .",
    "we compared our theoretical predictions with the abundance pattern observed in the very @xmath2-process - rich cs  22892 - 052 ( sneden et al .",
    "this star is known to show a _ pure _",
    "@xmath2-process signature ( it shows a @xmath2-process enhancement of about 40@xmath22 the solar value , much larger than any abundance observed in normal halo stars ) .",
    "we extracted from this star the @xmath2-fraction of sr , y , and zr ( @xmath510% of the solar value ) . in the light of our nucleosynthesis calculations in agb stars at different metallicities ,",
    "integrated over the gce model briefly described in this paper , we conclude that the @xmath1-process from agb stars contributes to the solar abundances of sr , y and zr by 71% , 69% and 65% , respectively . to the solar sr abundance",
    ", we also added a small contribution ( @xmath510% ) from the ` secondary ' weak @xmath1-component from massive stars .",
    "as a consequence of the above results , we conclude that a primary component from massive stars is needed to explain 8% of the solar abundance of sr , and 18% of solar y and zr .",
    "although this contribution to the solar composition is small , especially in terms of the overall uncertainties , it nevertheless appears to be necessary to produce the observed enrichment of these elements in the very low - metallicity stars .",
    "this process is of _ primary _ nature , unrelated to the classical metallicity - dependent weak @xmath1-component , and might be thought of as a lighter element primary process ( or lepp ) .",
    "we stress that the details of this nucleosynthesis are still not well understood , and charged - particle reactions and photodisintegrations may contribute along with neutron production .",
    "further , the same process to which the light neutron - capture elements sr , y and zr are sensitive , also likely affects the production of all elements from cu to sr . to understand in detail the complicated galactic nucleosynthesis history of sr , y and zr ( as well as other lighter element ) formation will require new theoretical studies and additional high - quality spectroscopic observational data , particularly of low - metallicity halo stars .",
