    "population inversion in a few - energy - level quantum system is strongly linked with its optical response and has resulted in traditional masing or lasing effects being successfully demonstrated @xcite .",
    "subsequently , enormous economical and technological progress was triggered due to quantum electronics .",
    "however at present , atomic steady - state population inversion is achievable essentially only in pumped two - level atomic systems involving efforts via extra transitions with additional photon sources or environmental vacuum modifications @xcite .",
    "additionally , two - level quantum dot systems may also exhibit population inversion due to extra phonon induced decay rates @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", lasing without population inversion operates as well with the help of induced quantum coherences @xcite .",
    "moreover , free - electron laser sources involving inversions of momentum states exist at higher frequencies leading to original effects @xcite .    over the past decade a range of experiments",
    "were performed demonstrating quantum effects in biological samples @xcite .",
    "particularly , energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems @xcite was observed in @xcite , while long - living quantum coherences survive in biological complexes even under normal conditions at room temperature @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence and entanglement in the processes of magneto - reception of the surrounding magnetic field @xcite were examined , too  @xcite .",
    "the single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and the emitted photon quantum statistics are further excellent tools for research in quantum biology @xcite . furthermore",
    ", coherent control of an effective two - level system in a non - markovian biomolecular environment was investigated  @xcite .",
    "additional quantum effects in biochemical systems are discussed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "an important issue raised in this context is to image tiny objects , such as biological cells or organic molecules and , therefore , highly refractive biological media are required @xcite .",
    "inspired by these remarkable advances in quantum biochemistry , here , we put forward a novel scheme that enables the creation of population inversion in certain biological samples acting as two - level systems with all possible dipole matrix elements being nonzero .",
    "the effect occurs due to induced quantum coherences which arise from the difference of the permanent dipole moments in the excited and ground states , respectively .",
    "this may allow for lasing or amplifying as well as optical switching devises in biomolecular materials .",
    "large index of refractions without absorption are also feasible which may lead to an enhanced optical imaging resolution of the biomolecular sample due to a reduced probe - field wavelength inside the medium . both the absorption or emission spectra can be used to extract the values of permanent dipoles .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the analytical approach and the system of interest , whereas in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the obtained results .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "we consider a two - level system possessing permanent dipoles and interacting with two external coherent laser fields .",
    "the first laser is near resonance with the transition frequency of the two - level sample while the second one is close to resonance with the dressed - frequency splitting due to the first laser , respectively ( see figure [ fig ] ) . as a concrete system",
    ", we may consider gamma - globulin macromolecules @xcite with the transition frequency @xmath0 , transition dipole moment @xmath1 and the difference between the diagonal dipole moments in the upper and lower bare states given by @xmath2 .",
    "however , the analytical formalism applies equally to spin @xcite , asymmetric semiconductor quantum dot @xcite or other alternative @xcite systems promising wider applications .",
    "the hamiltonian describing such a model , in a frame rotating at the first laser frequency @xmath3 , and in the dipole approximation is : @xmath4 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) the first three components are , respectively , the free energies of the environmental electromagnetic vacuum modes and molecular subsystems together with the laser - molecule interaction hamiltonian .",
    "there , @xmath5 is the corresponding rabi frequency with @xmath6 being the transition dipole moment while @xmath7 is the amplitude of the first laser field .    the fourth term accounts for the second laser interacting at frequency @xmath8 and amplitude @xmath9 with the molecular system due to presence of permanent dipoles incorporated in @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "the last term describes the interaction of the molecular subsystem with the environmental vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field reservoir .",
    "further , @xmath12 is the molecule - vacuum coupling strength with @xmath13 being the photon polarization vector and @xmath14 whereas @xmath15 is the quantization volume .",
    "@xmath16 is the laser field detuning from the molecular transition frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the molecule bare - state operators @xmath18 and @xmath19^{\\dagger}$ ] obey the commutation relations @xmath20=2s_{z}$ ] and @xmath21=\\pm s^{\\pm}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the bare - state inversion operator .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the excited and ground state of the molecule while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the creation and the annihilation operator of the @xmath27 electromagnetic field mode , and satisfy the standard bosonic commutation relations , namely , @xmath28=\\delta_{kk^{'}}$ ] , and @xmath29=[a^{\\dagger}_{k},a^{\\dagger}_{k^{'}}]=0 $ ] @xcite . notice that the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is incomplete .",
    "the following term @xmath30 will not be taken into account . here",
    ", the first term describes the interaction of the second laser with the molecular system due to the transition dipole @xmath31 , while the second one represents the interaction of the first laser with the molecule because of permanent dipoles and , hence , @xmath32 whereas @xmath33 .",
    "since we assume realistic conditions that @xmath34 @xcite as well as @xmath35 the hamiltonian @xmath36 can be considered as fast oscillating and , therefore , neglectable .    in the following",
    ", we shall consider a regime where the generalized rabi frequency @xmath37 is larger than the single - molecule spontaneous decay rate as well as the coupling due to permanent dipoles , i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to describe our system in the semi - classical laser - molecule dressed - state picture due to the first applied laser : @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the corresponding upper and lower dressed states , respectively ( see figure  [ fig]b ) . applying the dressed - state transformation to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "one arrives at the following hamiltonian represented in a frame rotating also at the second laser field frequency , i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and we have performed the rotating wave approximation with respect to @xmath8 , i.e. , we have assumed that @xmath47 . eliminating the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field reservoir in the usual way by adopting the born - markov approximations",

    "one can observe from eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) that permanent dipoles lead to the appearance of a pumping term among the dressed states .",
    "this term contributes to a completely unexpected behavior of the two - level system . in particular , as we shall see , it can induce pumping the system into an inverted state .",

    "i.e. @xmath69 , these quantities are zero in the moderately intense pumping regime considered here . therefore , new physics is expected due to existence of permanent dipoles in bichromatic pumping fields .",
    "in particular , figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the mean - value of the single - molecule bare - state inversion operator for particular parameters of interest . steady - state inversion in the bare states",
    "is achieved when @xmath70 and it occurs in the presence of permanent dipoles . on the other hand , figure [ fig2](a ) depicts the real part of the mean - value of the dressed - state coherence operator @xmath71 in steady - state .",
    "the minima observed in these behaviors correspond to an inverted molecular bare - state system ( compare fig .",
