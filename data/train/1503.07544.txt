    "the gravity theory proposed by hoava in ref .",
    "@xcite has acquired significant attention since its introduction .",
    "the basic idea is to improve the uv behaviour of the theory by modifying the dispersion relations , and hence the propagators .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a preferred foliation and constructing the action of the theory in such a way so that the ` kinetic ' terms contain only two time derivatives but there are also ` potential terms ' with higher order spatial derivatives .",
    "this introduces an anisotropic scaling between time and space at high energies , @xmath0^{-m}t\\,,\\qquad x^i\\to [ k]^{-1}x^i\\,,\\ ] ] where the latin indices span the @xmath1 dimensional spatial directions and @xmath2 $ ] is the momentum dimension .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that power counting renormalizability requires @xmath3 , so in @xmath4 dimensions @xmath5 has to be at least equal to @xmath6 and the dispersion relations would be of the type @xmath7 in the uv .    the existence of a preferred foliation leads to violations of lorentz invariance in the gravity sector .",
    "one of the main challenges that the theory confronts with , is the percolation of lorentz violations at low energy into the matter sector , where lorentz symmetry is very stringently constrained ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if dimension four lorentz violating operators are present in the matter sector , the propagation speeds of different species of particles run to the universal value logarithmically , indicating a severe fine - tuning problem @xcite .",
    "even if such terms are absent ( or tuned away ) and the lorentz violating operators are generated at higher dimensions , the latter are heavily constrained from synchrotron radiation in the crab nebula @xcite .    a possible mechanism to suppress the lorentz violations in the matter sector was proposed in @xcite .",
    "lorentz violations were restricted to the gravity sector at tree level and percolation to the matter sector though graviton loops was considered .",
    "it was shown that the lorentz - violating terms that are generated in the matter sector end up being suppressed by powers of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the uv scale above which the dispersion relations in the gravity sector cease to be relativistic and @xmath10 is the planck scale .",
    "lorentz violation constraints in the gravity sector are quite weak as we do not test gravity at energies above @xmath11 .",
    "hence , one can choose @xmath12 and this can push the lorentz violations in the matter sector below the experimental constraints .    however , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite also revealed a naturalness problem , stemming from the fact that the vector mode propagators are unaffected by the higher dimensional hoava terms . as a result ,",
    "the vector loops lead to quadratic divergences in the correction to the difference of propagation speeds between different matter species .",
    "the proposed resolution was to add the mixed derivative term @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) , where @xmath14 is the extrinsic curvature of the leaves of the preferred foliation and @xmath15 is the 3-dimensional covariant derivative operator on a leaf . including this term in the action improves the behavior of the vector mode .",
    "this term is not the only operator with two temporal and two spatial derivatives that one could add . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered all possible such terms and we performed the complete perturbative analysis of the most general extension of hoava gravity along these lines .",
    "the dispersion relation of the scalar and tensor modes in the uv turned out to be of 4th order , i.e. @xmath16 , as opposed to the 6th order ones in standard hoava gravity .",
    "one could interpret this as a threat to renormalizability , based on the standard power counting of hoava gravity .",
    "in fact , a specific tuning of coefficients that can restore the sixth order dispersion relations and that can still provide the sought for modification to the vector mode propagator does exist , so it is rather tempting to conclude that this tuning is necessary .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , by studying the lifshitz scalar as a toy model , counting rules get modified once the mixed - derivative terms are considered and one can have a renormalizable theory even with lower order dispersion relations .",
    "surprisingly , the simplest power counting renormalizable theory of this type exhibits relativistic , instead of anisotropic , scaling and this , unfortunately , leads to problems with unitarity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the lifshitz scalar with mixed derivative terms as a proxy for the behavior of hoava gravity and show that , if a larger number of operators is taken into account , models that are power counting renormalizable and unitary exist and can have lower order dispersion relations than the standard lifshitz scalar ( or standard hoava gravity ) .",
    "in order to consider the mixed derivative case , we use , following ref .",
    "@xcite , the lagrangian @xmath17 the anisotropic scaling is given in equation .",
    "the dimensions of the coupling constants are related through @xmath18 = [ \\beta][k]^{2y}\\,,\\qquad [ \\gamma]=[\\beta][k]^{2(m+y - z)}\\,.\\ ] ] hence , we can rewrite the lagrangian ( [ eq : lifshitzmixed ] ) as @xmath19\\ , , \\label{eq : lifshitzmixed2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20=[k]$ ] and @xmath21=[k]^0 $ ] .    here",
    ", we choose the normalization such that @xmath22 and fix the units such that the last two terms , which are expected to dominate in the uv , have the same dimensions .",
    "the latter condition gives the relation @xmath23 which , given a theory with fixed @xmath24 and @xmath25 , determines the degree of anisotropic scaling .",
    "requiring that the action @xmath26 be dimensionless , the dimension of the lifshitz scalar turns out to be @xmath27= [ k]^{d_{\\phi}}=   [ k]^{(d - m-2\\,y)/2}\\,.\\ ] ] if the scalar field @xmath28 is dimensionless or has negative dimension , i.e. @xmath29 , the coupling constants of @xmath30 interactions with arbitrary positive integer @xmath31 has positive dimensions .",
    "the standard lore in quantum field theory dictates that positive dimensional coupling constants is an indication of renormalizability for the corresponding interactions .",
    "this translates into the condition @xcite @xmath32 note that such dimensional arguments have to be treated with caution . indeed ,",
    "as we will show in section [ sec : sdod ] , they cease being trustworthy once derivative interactions are taken into account .",
    "we are interested in using the lifshitz scalar as a proxy for understanding the uv properties of a gravity theory with the same anisotropic scaling properties and derivative structure .",
    "since in gravity derivative interactions are inevitable , as a next step we include them as well and use a somewhat more robust criterion of renormalizability , the superficial degree of divergence .",
    "we now consider the free theory in the uv ( @xmath33 ) by choosing the appropriate normalization and units in eq.([eq : lifshitzmixed2 ] ) @xmath34 the green s function for the lifshitz scalar can be calculated as @xmath35}\\,.\\ ] ] for the momentum cutoff @xmath36 , each internal line in a feynman diagram contributes @xmath37 due to the anisotropic scaling the energy cutoff @xmath38 is different than the momentum cutoff @xmath36 and can be obtained through the dispersion relations as @xmath39 .",
    "thus , each loop integral contributes @xmath40    we will consider the most general self - interaction term given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coupling constant , while @xmath43 is shorthand for an @xmath44particle operator that contains @xmath45 spatial derivatives , @xmath46 temporal derivatives , or @xmath47 weighted derivatives .",
    "the dimensions of the coupling constant can then be found as @xmath48=[k]^{d_{\\lambda } } = [ k]^{d+m - p - s\\,d_\\phi}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : lamdim}\\ ] ] assuming that all the derivatives in a given vertex arises from internal lines , the cutoff dependent contribution from each vertex will be @xmath49 .    in conventional field theory , it is typically sufficient to have finite number of interactions that are renormalizable",
    ". however , here we are actually using a scalar field theory as a toy theory that will give us some insight into the renormalizability properties of lorentz - violating gravity .",
    "the perturbative expansion of a gravity theory includes infinitely many terms , due to the perturbative expansion of the inverse metric .",
    "all of these terms would have to be renormalizable for the theory to have the desired uv behaviour .",
    "hence , what we need to require is that any interaction of the type ( [ eq : generalinteraction ] ) , with @xmath50 , be renormalizable .",
    "we purposefully avoid choosing any particular term from some specific theory as an example , as the renormalizability of any such term would not necessarily imply that the ( nonlinear ) gravitational analogue is renormalizable .    for a diagram with @xmath51 loops , @xmath52 internal lines , @xmath53 external lines and @xmath54 vertices ,",
    "the superficial degree of divergence is calculated as , all the external lines ( @xmath53 ) would be associated with at least one spatial derivative of the field , contributing @xmath55 to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : generaldelta0 ] ) . ] @xmath56 using two well - known identities , stemming from general properties of feynman diagrams @xmath57 we can extract more information from the superficial degree of divergence .",
    "to do so we first eliminate @xmath51 and @xmath52 using ( [ eq : identities ] ) to find @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the dimensions of the field and of the coupling constant , respectively .",
    "this result is compatible with the standard intuition for power counting renormalizability : provided that @xmath61 , any interaction with positive dimension coupling constant @xmath62 will lead to a small and finite number or zero divergent diagrams , as convergence improves when the number of vertices or the number of external lines is increased",
    ". the condition @xmath62 can then be interpreted as an upper bound on @xmath44 and @xmath63 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamdim ] ) .    when one wishes to use the lifshitz scalar as a proxy for the behaviour of a gravity theory with the similar derivative structure , this standard result is not particularly useful .",
    "gravity theories are highly nonlinear and linearization around a given background will generate an infinite number of terms with infinite copies of the field , albeit the limited number of derivatives in each term .",
    "hence , one would wish to have convergent diagrams for any value of @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that this can only be achieved if @xmath64 .",
    "( [ eq : generaldelta1 ] ) is not of great use when considering the @xmath65 case , as the external lines contribution comes with the wrong sign .",
    "however , using the identities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : identities ] ) one can rewrite eq .   as @xmath66 it is now straightforward to see that ,",
    "so long as @xmath67 , the contribution from the loop either vanishes or each loop contributes more negative powers of the cutoff .",
    "it is the number of vertices , or more specifically the number of weighted derivatives in a vertex that really determine how divergent the diagram is .",
    "for example , for nonderivative interactions @xmath68 , we see immediately that the degree of divergence is @xmath69 if @xmath65 , indicating that @xmath30 are either log divergent or finite @xcite . for @xmath70",
    "the vertices contributions to the degree of divergence are negative , making @xmath71 bounded from above by a finite value .",
    "in other words , for the interaction terms that have equal or less weighted derivatives than the free terms , there is a finite amount of counterterms that can remove the divergences .",
    "interaction terms with @xmath72 will be nonrenormalizable , as at a given loop order one can always have diagrams with an arbitrary number of vertices .",
    "hence , such terms are not expected to be generated by radiative corrections .",
    "to summarize , when derivative interactions are considered , in addition to ( [ eq : renormfirst ] ) , we obtain the second renormalizability condition which restricts the allowed number of derivatives in a given interaction @xmath73 the maximum number of spatial gradients a renormalizable interaction can have is @xmath74 while the maximum number of time derivatives we can allow is @xmath75 we have thus found that the criterion for the renormalizability of an interaction term is more related to the number of derivatives it contains , rather than its dimensions .",
    "for the case where @xmath76 , the two criteria do coincide as one can already see using eq .",
    "( [ eq : generaldelta1 ] ) ; a term with a positive coupling constant necessarily contains equal or less derivatives than the free theory , thus is expected to be renormalizable .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath65 , the intuitive description that links renormalizability with the dimensions of the coupling constant breaks down .",
    "for instance , if @xmath77 is negative enough , @xmath78 can have negative dimensions and one can construct interaction terms with an arbitrary number of derivatives while still having a positive dimension coupling constant .",
    "nonetheless , as we have shown above , the interaction terms with @xmath72 would not actually be renormalizable .",
    "the last point made in the previous section , regarding the fact that interaction terms with @xmath72 are nonrenormalizable even though they have a positive dimension coupling constant , touches upon the issue of predictivity .",
    "if @xmath62 were a sufficient condition for renormalizabilty for derivative interactions , then radiative corrections would generate infinite counterterms .",
    "a similar issue exists for interactions with @xmath79 and a large number of copies of @xmath28 : so long as @xmath28 has zero or negative dimensions , and for a given number of derivatives , there is an infinite number of renormalizable interaction terms with ever increasing copies of @xmath28 that do not carry derivatives .",
    "this has already been pointed out in @xcite for the @xmath80 and @xmath81 theory , but our analysis reveals that it is actually a quite generic feature for theories with @xmath29 .",
    "one need not worry about this problem for the lifshitz scalar with no derivative interactions because it is a finite theory .",
    "but once derivative interactions are included the existence of infinite potential counterterms poses an actual threat for predictivity .",
    "a simple solution is to impose some symmetry , e.g. a shift symmetry @xmath82 , thus rendering the number of terms finite @xcite .    in a gravity theory one",
    "expects to have such a symmetry anyway . in hoava gravity in particular , symmetry under foliation",
    "preserving diffeomorphisms ( fdiffs ) symmetry comes to the rescue .",
    "although the expansion of the fdiff invariant terms lead to an infinite number of terms with ever increasing powers of the metric perturbations , the coefficients of these terms are not actually independent and can be expressed in terms of the original coupling constant , i.e. the number of coupling constants remain finite .",
    "we can now turn our attention to unitarity . in a theory with derivative interactions",
    "one has to make sure that threatening terms such as @xmath83 will not be generated by radiative corrections .",
    "the second renormalizability condition ( [ eq : renorm2 ] ) implies that the total number of time derivatives a term can have is given by ( [ rmax ] ) , which can be larger than @xmath84 if @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , the simplest example with @xmath86 , @xmath87 studied in ref .",
    "@xcite allows for dangerous terms with @xmath88 time derivatives and is thus nonunitary . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : timescaling ] ) indicates , the value of @xmath5 can be increased by including gradient terms with higher @xmath25 in the free theory . according to eq .",
    ", in order to avoid the unitarity breaking terms for @xmath85 , it is sufficient to require @xmath89 let us collect all of the conditions we have derived so far .",
    "for the theory @xmath90 the power counting renormalizability and unitarity requirements lead to @xmath91 for @xmath80 , @xmath92 and the standard renormalizability condition of hoava gravity is recovered @xmath93 along with the trivially satisfied condition @xmath94 .    for @xmath95 and @xmath86",
    ", we obtain @xmath96 where the last condition forbids relativistic scaling on the grounds of unitarity .    , the allowed region for the scaling exponent and mixed derivatives .",
    "the region above ( including ) the solid blue line corresponds to the region where the renormalizability condition ( [ eq : renormfirst ] ) holds .",
    "the region above ( excluding ) the dotted red line corresponds to the region where higher order time derivative terms are not generated ( [ unitarity1 ] ) .",
    "the combined allowed region is the darkest region .",
    ", width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] , we show the allowed @xmath97 region in @xmath95 . for a given mixed derivative term with arbitrary spatial derivatives ,",
    "one can always satisfy the power counting renormalizability and the unitarity conditions , provided that enough powers of gradient terms are included in the free action .",
    "to summarize , we have revisited the power counting arguments for a lifshitz scalar with mixed derivative terms .",
    "we have gone beyond the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite by considering the full class of theories with mixed derivative terms .",
    "our results suggest that the addition of mixed derivative terms to the standard lifshitz scalar can lead to theories that are power counting renormalizable and unitary , even though their dispersion relations and scaling properties are different than the standard lifshitz scalar .",
    "we have identified the precise conditions , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : condlist ] ) , that define the subclass of theories with these characteristics .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , mixed derivative terms have been used in the context of hoava gravity in order to regulate divergencies in vector mode loop integrals .",
    "these divergencies would otherwise introduce a naturalness problem in the suppression of lorentz violations in the matter sector @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , when all mixed derivative terms are consistently taken into account , the dispersion relations generically become 4th order .",
    "one could tune the coefficients in order to recover the 6th order dispersion relations ( while still having the sought for modification to the vector mode propagator ) .",
    "however , to the extent that the lifshitz scalar is a good proxy for hoava gravity , our results suggest that such tuning is not actually necessary . in @xmath4 dimensions ,",
    "in particular a theory with @xmath86 , @xmath98 , _",
    "i.e. _  standard hoava gravity with terms that are 6th order in spatial derivatives , supplemented with mixed derivative term with two temporal and two spatial derivatives , is both power counting renormalizable and unitary , even though it has anisotropic index @xmath99 and 4th order dispersion relations .",
    "we close with a note of caution : even though in all of the theories with mixed derivatives terms , the behavior of the vector mode gets modified , the dispersion relations for the scalar and tensor modes are not necessarily of sixth order . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the suppression of lorentz violations in the matter sector assumed sixth order dispersion relations , so it is not straightforward to conclude that its results would be applicable to theories with a different anisotropic index .",
