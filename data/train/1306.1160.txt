    "different theoretical models have been proposed to explain the outflows from protostars and cttss ( see review by ferreira , dougados , & cabrit 2006 ) .",
    "the models include those where the outflow originates from a radially distributed disc wind ( blandford & payne 1982 ; knigl & pudritz 2000 ; casse & keppens 2004 ; ferreira et al .",

    "it is gradually accelerated to poloidal velocities @xmath56 and the azimuthal velocity decreases .",
    "the flow has a high density and carries most of the disc mass into the outflows .",
    "the situation is the opposite in the axial jet component where the density is @xmath57 times lower , while the poloidal and total velocities are significantly higher .",
    "thus we find a _ two - component outflow _ : a matter dominated conical wind and a magnetically dominated axial jet .",
    "we observe conical winds in both slowly and rapidly rotating stars . in both cases ,",
    "matter in the conical winds passes through the alfvn surface ( and shortly thereafter through the fast magnetosonic point ) , beyond which the flow is matter - dominated in the sense that the energy flow is carried mainly by the matter .",
    "the situation is different for the axial jet component where the flow is sub - alfvnic within the simulation region . for this component",
    "the energy flow is carried by the poynting flux and the angular moment flow is carried by the magnetic field .",
    "* collimation and driving of the outflows : * figure 4 shows the long - distance development of a conical wind from a slowly rotating star . at large distances the conical wind becomes collimated .    to understand the collimation we analyzed total force ( per unit mass ) perpendicular to a poloidal magnetic field line ( lii et al .",

    "once the jet begins to collimate , the curvature term @xmath63 also becomes negligible .",
    "the magnetic force may act to either collimate or decollimate the jet , depending on the relative magnitudes of the toroidal @xmath64 gradient ( which collimates the outflow ) and poloidal @xmath65 gradient ( which `` decollimates '' ) . in our simulations",
    ", the collimation of the matter implies that the magnetic hoop stress is larger than the poloidal field gradient .",
    "thus the main perpendicular forces acting in the jet are the collimating effect of the toroidal magnetic field and the decollimating effect of the centrifugal force and the gradient of @xmath66 .",
    "the collimated effect of @xmath67 dominates .",
    "note that in mks units @xmath68 is the poloidal current flowing through a surface of radius @xmath69 from colatitude zero to @xmath31 .",
    "for the jets from young stars this current is of the order of @xmath70 a.        the driving force for the outflow is simply the force parallel to the poloidal magnetic field of the flow @xmath71 .",

    "the pressure gradient force , @xmath76 , dominates within the disk .",
    "the matter in the disk is approximately in keplerian rotation such that the sum of the gravitational and centrifugal forces roughly cancel ( @xmath77 ) . near the slowly rotating star , however ,",
    "the matter is strongly coupled to the stellar magnetic field and the disk orbits at sub - keplerian speeds , giving @xmath78 .",

    "1991 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the variation of the total force @xmath80 , the gravitational plus centrifugal force , and the magnetic force along a representative field line .",
    "this analysis establishes that the predominant driving force for the outflow is the magnetic force ( eq .",

    "* variability : * for both rapidly and slowly rotating stars the magnetic field lines connecting the disc and the star have the tendency to inflate and open ( lovelace , romanova & bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 ) .",
    "quasi - periodic reconstruction of the magnetosphere due to inflation and reconnection has been discussed theoretically ( aly & kuijpers 1990 ) and has been observed in a number of axisymmetrtic simulations ( hirose et al . 1997 ; goodson et al . 1997 , 1999 ; matt et al .",
    "2002 ; romanova et al .",
    "goodson & winglee ( 1999 ) discuss the physics of inflation cycles .",
    "they have shown that each cycle of inflation consists of a period of matter accumulation near the magnetosphere , diffusion of this matter through the magnetospheric field , inflation of the corresponding field lines , accretion of some matter onto the star , and outflow of some matter as winds , with subsequent expansion of the magnetosphere .",
    "there simulations show @xmath81 cycles of inflation and reconnection .",
    "our simulations often show @xmath82 cycles of inflation and reconnection .",
    "figure 6 shows the time evolution of the accretion rates for a of a slowly rotating star ( romanova et al . 2009 ) .",
    "kurosawa and romanova ( 2012 ) have calculated spectra from modeled conical winds using the radiative transfer code torus and have shown that conical winds may explain different features in the hydrogen spectral lines , in the he i line and also a relatively narrow , low - velocity blue - shifted absorption components in the he i @xmath83 which is often seen in observations ( kurosawa et al .",
    "there is clear evidence , mainly from hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations , of the asymmetry between the approaching and receding jets from a number of young stars .",

    "specifically , the radial speed of the approaching jet may differ by a factor of two from that of the receding jet .",
    "for example , for rw aur the radial redshifted speed is @xmath84 km / s whereas the blueshifted radial speed is @xmath85 km / s .",
    "the mass and momentum fluxes are also significantly different for the approaching and receding jets in a number of cases . of course , it is possible that the observed asymmetry of the jets could be due to say differences in the gas densities on the two sides of the source . here",
    ", we discuss the case of intrinsic asymmetry where the asymmetry of outflows is connected with asymmetry of the star s magnetic field .",
    "substantial observational evidence points to the fact that young stars often have _ complex _ magnetic fields consisting of dipole , quadrupole , and higher order poles misaligned with respect to each other and the rotation axis ( jardine et al . 2002 ;",
    "donati et al . 2008 ) .",
    "analysis of the plasma flow around stars with realistic fields have shown that a fraction of the star s magnetic field lines are open and may carry outflows ( e.g. , gregory et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it is evident that the complex magnetic field of a star will destroy the commonly assumed symmetry of the magnetic field and the plasma about the equatorial plane .",
    "figure 7 shows an illustrative complex magnetic field consisting of the combination of a dipole and a quadrupole field both of which are axisymmetric .",
    "the figure includes the suggested locations of the funnel flow to the star ( romanova et al .",
    "2002 ) and the conical wind outflows .",
    "the mhd simulations fully support the qualitative picture suggested in figure 7 ( lovelace et al .",
    "the time - scale during which the jet comes from the upper hemisphere is set by the evolution time - scale for the stellar magnetic field .",
    "this is determined by the dynamo processes responsible for the generation of the field .    remarkably , once the assumption of symmetry about the equatorial plane is dropped , we find that the conical winds alternately come from one hemisphere and then the other _ even _ when the stellar magnetic field is a centered axisymmetric dipole ( lovelace et al .",
    "2010 ) . an illustrative case of this spontaneous symmetry breaking is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the time - scale for the ` flipping ' is the accretion time - scale of the inner part of the disc which is expected to be much less than the evolution time of the star s magnetic field .",
    "detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations have established that long - lasting outflows of cold disc matter into a hot low - density corona from the disc - magnetosphere boundary in cases of slowly and rapidly rotating stars .",
    "the main results are the following :    for slowly rotating stars a new type of outflow  a conical wind  has been discovered .",
    "matter flows out forming a _ conical wind _ which has the shape of a thin conical shell with a half - opening angle @xmath86 .",
    "the outflows appear in cases where the magnetic flux of the star is bunched up by the inward accretion flow of the disc .",
    "we find that this occurs when the turbulent magnetic prandtl number ( the ratio of viscosity to diffusivity ) @xmath87 , and when the viscosity is sufficiently high , @xmath50 .",
    "winds from the disc - magnetosphere boundary have been proposed earlier by shu and collaborators and referred to as x - winds ( shu et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this model",
    ", the wind originates from a small region near the corotation radius @xmath12 , while the disc truncation radius @xmath88 ( or , the magnetospheric radius @xmath5 ) is only slightly smaller than @xmath12 ( @xmath89 , shu et al .",
    "it is suggested that excess angular momentum flows from the star to the disc and from there into the x - winds .",
    "the model aims to explain the slow rotation of the star and the formation of jets . in the simulations discussed here we have obtained outflows from both slowly and rapidly rotating stars",
    "both have conical wind components which are reminiscent of x - winds . in some respects",
    "the conical winds are similar to x - winds : they both require _ bunching _ of the poloidal field lines and show outflows from the inner disc ; and they both have high rotation and show gradual poloidal acceleration ( e.g. , najita & shu 1994 ) .",
    "the main differences are the following : ( 1 ) the conical / propeller outflows have _ two components _ : a slow high - density conical wind ( which can be considered as an analogue of the x - wind ) , and a fast low - density jet .",
    "no jet component is discussed in the x - wind model .",
    "( 2 ) conical winds form around stars with _ any rotation rate _ including very slowly rotating stars .",
    "they do not require fine tuning of the corotation and truncation radii .",
    "for example , bunching of field lines is often expected during periods of enhanced or unstable accretion when the disc comes closer to the surface of the star and @xmath90 . under this condition",
    "conical winds will form .",
    "in contrast , x - winds require @xmath91 .",
    "( 3 ) the base of the conical wind component in both slowly and rapidly rotating stars is associated with the region where the field lines are bunched up , and not with the corotation radius .",
    "( 4 ) x - winds are driven by the _",
    "centrifugal force _ , and as a result matter flows over a wide range of directions below the  dead zone \" ( shu et al . 1994 ; ostriker & shu 1995 ) . in conical winds",
    "the matter is driven by the",
    "_ magnetic force _",
    "( lovelace et al . 1991 ) which acts such that the matter flows into a _ thin shell _ with a cone half - angle @xmath92 .",
    "the same force tends to collimate the flow .    for rapidly rotating stars in the propeller regime where @xmath93 and where the condition for bunching , @xmath94 , is satisfied we find two distinct outflow components ( 1 ) a relatively low - velocity conical wind and ( 2 ) a high - velocity axial jet .",
    "a significant part of the disc matter and angular momentum flows into the conical winds . at the same time a significant part of the rotational energy of the star flows into the magnetically - dominated axial jet .",
    "this regime is particularly relevant to protostars , where the star rotates rapidly and has a high accretion rate .",
    "the star spins down rapidly due to the angular momentum flow into the axial jet along the field lines connecting the star and the corona . for typical parameters a protostar spins down in @xmath95 years .",
    "the axial jet is powered by the spin - down of the star rather than by disc accretion .",
    "the matter fluxes into both components ( wind and jet ) strongly oscillate due to events of inflation and reconnection .",
    "most powerful outbursts occur every @xmath96 months .",
    "the interval between outbursts is expected to be longer for smaller diffusivities in the disc .",
    "outbursts are accompanied by higher outflow velocities and stronger self - collimation of both components .",
    "such outbursts may explain the ejection of knots in some cttss every few months .",
    "when the artificial requirement of symmetry about the equatorial plane is dropped , mhd simulations reveal that the conical winds may alternately come from one side of the disc and then the other even for the case where the stellar magnetic field is a centered axisymmetric dipole ( lovelace et al .",
