    "since their discovery by rosenau and hyman in 1993  @xcite , compactons have found diverse applications in physics in the analysis of patterns on liquid surfaces  @xcite , in approximations for thin viscous films  @xcite , ocean dynamics  @xcite , magma dynamics  @xcite , and medicine  @xcite .",
    "compactons are also the object of study in brane cosmology  @xcite as well as mathematical physics  @xcite , and the dynamics of nonlinear lattices  @xcite to model the dispersive coupling of a chain of oscillators  @xcite .",
    "multidimensional rh compactons have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , compact structures also have been studied in the context of a klein - gordon model  @xcite .",
    "a recent review of nonlinear evolution equations with cosine / sine compacton solutions can be found in ref .  .",
    "compactons represent a class of traveling - wave solutions with compact support resulting from the balance of both nonlinearity and nonlinear dispersion .",
    "compactons were discovered by rosenau and hyman ( rh ) in the process of studying the role played by nonlinear dispersion in pattern formation in liquid drops using a family of fully nonlinear korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equations  @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the wave amplitude , @xmath3 is the spatial coordinate and @xmath4 is time .",
    "rh called these solitary waves compactons , and eq .",
    "is known as the @xmath5 compacton equation .",
    "the rh compactons have the remarkable soliton property that after colliding with other compactons they reemerge with the same coherent shape .",
    "however , unlike the soliton collisions in an integrable system , the point where the compactons collide is marked by the creation of low - amplitude compacton - anticompacton pairs  @xcite .",
    "the rh generalization of the kdv equation   is only derivable from a lagrangian in the @xmath6 case .",
    "hence , in general , eq .   does not exhibit the usual energy conservation law .",
    "therefore , cooper , shepard and sodano  @xcite proposed a different generalization of the kdv equation based on the first - order lagrangian @xmath7 \\ , dx     \\>.     \\label{eq : llp}\\ ] ] we note that the set @xmath8 in eq",
    ".   corresponds to the set @xmath9 in eq .  .",
    "since then , various other lagrangian generalizations of the kdv equation have been considered  @xcite . with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , the structural stability of the resulting compactons was studied solely using analytical techniques such as linear stability analysis  @xcite , and an exhaustive numerical study of the stability and dynamical properties of these compacton solitary waves is needed .    in general , the numerical analysis of compactons",
    "is a difficult numerical problem because compactons have at most a finite number of continuous derivatives at their edges . unlike the compactons derived from the lagrangian  ,",
    "the rh compactons have been the object of intense numerical study using pseudospectral methods  @xcite , finite - element methods based on cubic b - splines  @xcite and on piecewise polynomials discontinuous at the finite element interfaces  @xcite , finite - differences methods  @xcite , methods of lines with adaptive mesh refinement  @xcite , and particle methods based on the dispersive - velocity method  @xcite .",
    "both the pseudospectral and finite - differences methods require artificial dissipation ( hyperviscosity ) to simulate interacting compactons without appreciable spurious radiation .",
    "the rh pseudospectral methods use a discrete fourier transform and incorporate the hyperviscosity using high - pass filters based on second spatial derivatives . using this approach rh",
    "showed successfully that compactons collide without any apparent radiation .",
    "however , because the pseudospectral methods explicitly damp the high - frequency modes in order to alleviate the negative effects due to the high - frequency dispersive errors introduced by the lack of smoothness at the edges of the compacton , the pseudospectral approach is not suitable for the study of high - frequency phenomena , and the usability of filters themselves has been called in the question  @xcite . in turn",
    ", finite - differences methods usually incorporate the artificial dissipation via a fourth spatial derivative term .",
    "however , in the absence of high - frequency filtering , these methods are marred by the appearance of spurious radiation  @xcite .",
    "this radiation propagates both backward and forward and has an amplitude smaller by a few orders of magnitude than the compacton amplitude .",
    "its numerical origin can be identified by a grid refinement technique .",
    "recently , rus and villatoro  @xcite introduced a discretization procedure for uniform spatial grids based on a pad approximant - like  @xcite improvement of finite - differences methods .",
    "as special cases , this approach can be used to obtain the familiar second - order finite - differences methods and the fourth - order petrov - galerkin finite - element method developed by sanz - serna and co - authors  @xcite . given the involved character of the petrov - galerkin approach based on linear interpolants described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we believe the work by rus and villatoro ( rv ) lends itself to further scrutiny .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic derivation of the pad approximants  @xcite intended to calculate derivatives of smooth functions on a uniform grid by deriving higher - order approximations using traditional finite - differences formulas .",
    "our derivation recovers as special cases the pad approximants first introduced by rus and villatoro  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate our approach for the particular case when second - order finite - differences formulas are used as the starting point to derive _ at least _ fourth - order accurate approximations of the first three derivatives of a smooth function .",
    "this approach is equivalent to deriving the best differencing schemes involving only nearest and next - to - nearest neighbors on a uniform grid .",
    "we apply these approximation schemes to the study of stability and dynamical properties of @xmath10 rosenau - hyman compactons .",
    "this study is intended to establish the baseline for future studies of the stability and dynamical properties of @xmath11 compactons , which feature higher - order nonlinearities and terms with mixed - derivatives that are not present in the @xmath10 equations .",
    "hence , the numerical analysis of the properties of the @xmath12 compactons of eq .",
    "is expected to be considerably more difficult .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : approx ] we discuss several special cases : three of these cases describe approximation schemes that mix fourth - order accurate approximations for two of the derivatives @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 with a sixth - order accurate approximation for the third one .",

    "we note that _ even_- and _ odd_-order derivatives require approximants that are _ symmetric _ and _ antisymmetric _ in  @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we also note that although all four operators , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , lead to second - order accurate numerical approximations , the derivatives @xmath15 and @xmath34 involve the subset of grid points @xmath35 , whereas the derivatives @xmath13 and @xmath14 involve only the subset of grid points @xmath36 . therefore , it is possible to design a numerical scheme that improves the order of approximation of the derivatives @xmath13 and @xmath14 by incorporating the additional grid points , @xmath37 ( see appendix  [ app : a ] ) .",
    "it is more challenging , however , to find a consistent approach that improves the order of approximation of all four lowest - order derivatives without extending the set of grid points .",

    "we conclude that none of our four pad approximations appears as a clear winner in the context of the three minimization criteria for an optimal numerical discretization of the compacton problem : length and amplitude of the radiation train , and amplitude at the leading edge of the radiation train .",

    "the ( 4,4,6 ) scheme has the smallest amplitude at the leading edge of the train and the amplitude of the train is comparable otherwise with that in the ( 4,4,4 ) scheme , but the length of the radiation train in the ( 4,4,6 ) scheme is the largest of the four approximations considered here .",
    "hence , the ( 4,4,6 ) scheme will probably be most useful in studies of the dynamical properties of the system and deal best with shock - type problems , but will require the largest model space ( largest value of @xmath146 ) to avoid the undesired wrap around effect of the solution due to the periodic boundary conditions constraint , which in turn will make grid refining studies difficult in the ( 4,4,6 ) scheme , because of physical constraints in allocatable memory and cpu wall time .",

    "our dynamical simulations indicate that the results obtained using this method closely resemble those obtained using the ( 4,4,4 ) scheme , and the ( 6,4,4 ) scheme is less susceptible to instabilities , at least in the particular cases discussed here , than the ( 4,4,4 ) scheme .",
