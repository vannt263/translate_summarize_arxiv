    "the _ beppo - sax _ results have revolutionized our understanding of grbs by opening a window on x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows which are delayed from the prompt x - ray and @xmath3-ray emissions by several hours and more ( e.g. , costa et al .  1997 ; feroci et al .  1998 ; piro et al.1998 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ; frail 1998 ) .",
    "the decaying power - law long - wavelength afterglows are compellingly explained as the emissions from a relativistic blast wave which decelerates and radiates through the process of sweeping up material from a uniform cbm ( e.g. , paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1997 ; wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ; tavani 1997 ) .",
    "afterglow behaviors more complicated than simple power laws may involve effects of extinction , self - absorption , scintillation , and cbm structure .",
    "mszros & rees ( 1993 ) proposed that the energy of a fireball s blast wave could be efficiently converted into radiation during the prompt gamma - ray luminous phase of a grb through the interaction of a blast wave with the cbm . in the external shock model , all grb emissions are due to the effects of a single thin blast wave which interacts with the cbm . because the directed kinetic energy of the blast wave is converted into nonthermal particle energy by sweeping up material from the cbm , the emitted radiation depends crucially on the density distribution of the cbm in the blast wave s path .",
    "smoother grb time profiles therefore represent more uniform cbms , at least within the doppler cone from which most of the detected grb emissions originate .",
    "conversely , erratic and spiky grb time profiles represent blast - wave deceleration in highly textured cbms ( dermer & mitman 1999 ) .    in a recent paper ( dermer , chiang , & bttcher 1999 ; hereafter dcb ) , we proposed a parametric description of the radiation observed from a spherically expanding blast wave which decelerates and is energized by sweeping up material from a smooth cbm . by ",
    "smooth \" we mean that the cbm density distribution is adequately represented by the expression @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the radial coordinate . in this limit , the deceleration of the blast wave produces a time profile which mimics the so - called fast rise , exponential decay ( fred ) grb light curves .",
    "our _ ansatz _ is that a smooth cbm produces an ideal fred light curve .",
    "conversely , a grb which exhibits the classic fred - type profile results from a fireball embedded within and expanding into a smooth cbm .    in this _",
    ", we make three quantitative predictions that can be tested using batse and beppo - sax data from bright fred - type grb time profiles , though the predictions would be most thoroughly tested with a grb telescope which is much more sensitive than batse and measures prompt grb emission in the range between @xmath5 kev and several mev . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model equations derived in dcb .",
    "spectral and temporal predictions are given analytically and described graphically for a model fireball with @xmath6 . in section 3 we show that the reason that grbs are usually observed with @xmath2 peaks in the @xmath7 kev - several mev range is understood when account is taken of blast - wave physics and the triggering properties of burst detectors .",
    "in dbc , a parametrization of the nonthermal synchrotron emission from a decelerating blast wave observed at time @xmath8 and photon energy @xmath9 was proposed .",
    "the function is based on the analytic approach of dermer & chiang ( 1998 ) and the numerical results of chiang & dermer ( 1999 ) , which were in turn based upon the blast - wave physics developed by , e.g. , blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) , rees & mszros ( 1992 ) , piran & shemi ( 1993 ) , mszros & rees ( 1993 ) , mszros , laguna , & rees ( 1993 ) , waxman ( 1997 ) , and vietri ( 1997 ) .",
    "the deceleration of the relativistic blast wave is assumed to follow the expression @xmath10 when @xmath11 , and @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 is the initial bulk lorentz factor of the blast wave and the decleration radius @xmath15^{1/3}$ ] cm . in this relation ,",
    "the burst source emits @xmath16 ergs sr@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 @xmath20 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only spherically symmetric blast waves . the parameter @xmath21 specifies the radiative regime , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the adiabatic and radiative limits , respectively .",
    "the deceleration time scale @xmath24^{1/3}$ ] s.    the function proposed in dbc to model the blast - wave radiation has the broken - power law form @xmath25^{-\\u}+(\\u/\\delta)[\\e/\\e_p(t)]^{\\d }   } \\;,\\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath2 spectral indices at energies below and above the temporally - evolving break energy @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "expressions for @xmath29 ^ 4 ( x / x_d)^{-\\eta/2}$ ] and the time - varying amplitude @xmath30 ^ 4 ( x / x_d)^{2-\\eta}$ ] are given in dbc by eqs.(9 ) and ( 16 ) , respectively .",
    "( 1 ) depends on the specification of the nine parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the equipartion parameter @xmath31^{1/2}\\xi_e^2 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the compression ratio and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the magnetic field and electron equipartition values , respectively ( see eqs .  [ 7 ] and [ 8 ] in dcb ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath21 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are assumed to be independent of time .",
    "this assumption is obviously not true in general , but is realized in the limit that high - quality broadband measurements from a bright fred - type grb are made over a sufficiently short observing times @xmath37 so that radiative - cooling and magnetic field - evolution time scales in the comoving frame are @xmath38 .    the thick curves in fig .",
    "1 show time profiles calculated at various observing energies @xmath39 , using the equations of the previous section .",
    "the thin curves show spectral indices calculated between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here",
    "we show results for fireballs with @xmath6 which are located at redshift @xmath41 ; other parameters are listed in table 1 . in this example , @xmath42 s and @xmath43 .",
    "the model grb light curves shown in fig .  1 display a rapid rise followed by a gentler decay which approaches a power - law afterglow behavior @xmath44 ( see eq .  [ 22 ] in dcb ) at late times @xmath45 .",
    "the overall shape of the model light curves shown in fig .",
    "1 resembles the characteristic fred - type grb light curve ( e.g. , fishman & meegan 1995 ) .",
    "the model grb represents a very bright batse grb if located at @xmath41 , but would fall below batse detectablity if located at @xmath46 .",
    "the analytic approximation used for the evolution of @xmath47 gives spectral index curves which are constant when @xmath48 . at later times",
    ", the blast - wave deceleration means that an observer measuring a photon spectrum over a fixed range of energies will sample photons which are produced at progressively higher energies in the blast wave s frame of reference .",
    "because a nonthermal synchrotron spectrum from a power - law distribution of electrons with a low energy cutoff is very hard at low energies and softens at higher energies , blast - wave deceleration produces the hard - to - soft spectral evolution observed in many grb time profiles ( norris et al .",
    "if the observer is monitoring a grb at @xmath49 , the flux is brightest when @xmath50 . as can be seen from fig .  1",
    ", the spectrum remains hard until @xmath51 , after which the blast wave begins to decelerate and the spectrum softens .",
    "thus the spectrum is hardest when it is most intense , accounting for the hardness - intensity correlation observed in grb light curves ( golenetskii et al .",
    "1983 ) . if the blast wave produces short time scale variability by interacting with inhomogeneities in the cbm ( dermer & mitman 1999 ) , then the individual pulses in grb profiles would likewise exhibit spectral hardening and subsequent softening , as generally observed in well - defined pulses of grb light curves ( ford et al .  1995 ; crider et al .",
    "the qualitative ability of the blast wave model to explain these empirical trends has been pointed out previously by panaitescu & mszros ( 1998 ) .",
    "we now propose three quantitative predictions to test the validity of this model .",
    "as is evident from fig .  1 , the peak flux shifts to later times at lower photon energies .",
    "the peak times are given analytically by the expression @xmath52 \\ } \\ ; \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] ( see also chiang 1998 ) . by plotting the times of a well - defined peak for a grb measured over a large energy range ,",
    "one tests the external shock model and constrains values of @xmath53 and the index @xmath54 .",
    "the peak shifting will be more pronounced in grbs with larger values of @xmath53 .",
    "our second prediction is that the temporal indices of a pulse profile vary with photon energy according to the relation @xmath55 .",
    "this yields a complicated analytic expression from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , though it is easily calculated numerically .",
    "when @xmath56 , however , the analytic form gives @xmath57 thus we predict that the temporal index @xmath58 changes from @xmath59 at low energies to @xmath60 at high energies . for a uniform cbm",
    ", there is no shift and the temporal index @xmath61 .",
    "when @xmath62 , the relation between the temporal and spectral indices indicated by eq .",
    "( 3 ) implies the value of @xmath35 .",
    "as can also be seen from fig .  1 , the spectral index is hardest at the leading edge of a grb peak and softens at the trailing edge , with the change in the values of the spectral index decreasing towards higher photon energies .",
    "this prediction can be made quantitative by taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , giving the result @xmath63 for the @xmath64 spectral index , where @xmath65 .",
    "the external shock model can be tested by plotting the energy - dependent variation of the spectral index across the peak of a grb from eq .",
    "although the above equations provide a simple analytic characterization of the predictions of the external shock model , they depend crucially on the @xmath47-prescription noted above .",
    "moreover , electron cooling is not taken into account in the analytic model .",
    "we used a numerical simulation code ( chiang & dermer 1999 ) to determine the reliability of the analytic predictions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 using the parameters of table 1 . because the radiative regime @xmath21 in the simulation depends on the magnetic field @xmath66(g ) , the value of @xmath67 $ ] was adjusted until the bulk lorentz factor approached the asymptotic behavior @xmath68 in the deceleration phase .",
    "this occurred for @xmath69 .",
    "the injection spectrum of electrons is chosen @xmath70 in order to give an uncooled spectrum with @xmath71 .",
    "electron cooling is seen to be important at high photon energies .",
    "the peak of the light curves at large photon energies occurs at @xmath72 , with a peak flux @xmath73 greater than the analytic estimate .",
    "we find that the qualitative trends of the predictions described above are reproduced in the detailed calculation .",
    "the analytic model can be used to confine the parameter range , but detailed fitting to data should employ the more accurate numerical simulations .",
    "even if cosmic fireballs were produced with a narrow range of values of @xmath14 , their @xmath64 peaks would be distributed over a wide range of photon energies since @xmath74 .",
    "it has therefore been something of a mystery to understand why grbs are usually detected with @xmath2 peaks in a narrow range of photon energies between @xmath7  kev and @xmath75  mev ( see , e.g. , malozzi et al.1995 ; piran & narayan 1996 ) without requiring fine - tuning of the parameters .",
    "brainerd s ( 1994 ) compton attenuation model , for example , has been advanced to specifically address this puzzle . by contrast to grbs , the nonthermal emissions in blazars",
    "are also thought to originate from relativistic outflows , yet they have @xmath2 peaks in both their synchrotron and compton components which range over three orders - of - magnitude or more in photon energy ( e.g. , von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ) .    using the spectral form proposed in dcb",
    ", we show how this paradox is resolved for a uniform cbm ( the generalization to @xmath76 is straightforward ) .",
    "suppose an instrument triggers on peak flux measured over the time scale @xmath77 and over a narrow range of photon energies centered at @xmath78 . when the mean duration @xmath79 of the fireball measured at @xmath78 is longer than @xmath77 , then the detector triggers on peak flux .",
    "from the expressions for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find that fireballs with @xmath82^{1/4}$ ] are observed with the peak of their @xmath2 spectrum at photon energy @xmath78 at the moment when the received bolometric power is greatest ( i.e. , when @xmath83 )",
    ". dirtier fireballs with @xmath84 produce a peak flux at @xmath78 which declines according to the relation @xmath85 , as can be derived by inserting eq.(2 ) into eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the limit @xmath86 ( see also eq .  [ 19 ] in dcb ) . because @xmath87 , the peak flux therefore rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "cleaner fireballs with @xmath88 are also more difficult to detect because in this case , @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "[ 20 ] in dcb ) . in order to be observed at all , blast waves can not be perfectly adiabatic , so that @xmath90 and the peak flux detected with a grb instrument decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "cleaner fireballs are more difficult to detect than indicated above , because when @xmath91 , the detector triggers on fluence rather than flux .",
    "the fluence @xmath92 decreases with increasing @xmath14 according @xmath93 , using eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the expression for @xmath80 with @xmath94 . because of the emission properties of blast waves , detectors which trigger on peak flux over a fixed time window will therefore be most sensitive to fireballs which have @xmath2 peaks in the energy range of the detector .",
    "hence the discovery of new classes of clean and dirty fireballs must consider varying time windows and energy ranges in the triggering criteria of a detector , and must also contend with the levels of background radiation as discussed in dcb .    in separate work ( bttcher & dermer 1999 ) , we model the triggering properties of grb detectors and show that compared to the batse grb trigger rate , the dirty fireball rate is poorly known due to selection biases against their detection .",
    "observational analyses of _ ariel v _ x - ray data ( grindlay 1999 ; see discussion in dcb ) provides the strongest available limit on the frequency of dirty fireballs .",
    "by contrast , the relative rate of clean fireballs is strongly constrained in the analysis of bttcher & dermer ( 1999 ) unless there is a strong anti - correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath36 .    in summary",
    ", we have used a simple analytic description of the external shock model of grbs to pose three predictions which can be tested by fitting eqs.(2)-(4 ) to high quality data obtained with a grb telescope sensitive in the @xmath5 kev - several mev range .",
    "although we have employed a simple mathematical parametrization , detailed fits to data should use numerical simulations of the decelerating blast wave ( e.g. , chiang & dermer 1999 , panaitescu & meszaros 1998 ) .",
    "we have also explained why detectors which trigger on peak flux are most sensitive to fireballs which produce @xmath2 peaks in the 50 kev - several mev range , resolving a long - standing puzzle in relativistic beaming models of grbs .",
