    "many studies have been done on the chaotic properties of the lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "it is a simple model which consists of a single particle moving freely between elastic spherical scatterers .",
    "the scatterers can either be placed at random or in a lattice configuration .",
    "the lorentz gas provides a physical system yet is still simple enough to allow for exact calculations of many properties .",
    "this simplicity is partially due to the fact that the lorentz gas contains only one moving particle , and therefore does not have many dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "systems with more degrees of freedom , such as moving hard spheres or disks , have also been studied frequently .",
    "extensive simulation work has been done on their lyapunov spectrum @xcite , and for low densities analytic calculations have been done for the largest lyapunov exponent @xcite , the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite and for the smallest positive lyapunov exponents @xcite . from the viewpoint of dynamical systems",
    "theory the lorentz gas and hard sphere systems are very similar , as noted already many years ago by sinai @xcite .",
    "both systems may be viewed as `` billiards '' , i.e.  systems consisting of fixed obstacles in a , mostly high - dimensional , configuration space , among which a point particle moves elastically . in the case of the lorentz gas these scatterers are ( hyper)spheres , in that of the hard - sphere system they are hypercylinders . in either case",
    "the convexity of the scatterers makes the system strongly chaotic . in several respects",
    "the lorentz gas is much simpler than the hard sphere system .",
    "first of all the scatterers for the lorentz gas are invariant under rotations in configuration space , which , as we will see , simplifies calculations enormously .",
    "further , the uniform convexity of the lorentz gas scatterers , in contrast to the hypercylinders of the hard - sphere systems , strongly simplifies proofs of ergodic and chaotic properties @xcite .",
    "yet we think it is of interest to perform an explicit calculation of the full lyapunov spectrum of a high - dimensional dilute lorentz gas .",
    "it is interesting to see the similarities as well as the differences between the lorentz gas and the hard - sphere spectra .",
    "in addition the methods used here may well be amenable to refinements , so as to make them applicable to systems of many moving particles .    in this paper",
    ", we study the behavior of a dilute , random , non - overlapping , lorentz gas in an arbitrary number of dimensions , @xmath0 . for large @xmath0",
    "this system has many degrees of freedom , while , largely due to the spherical symmetry of the scatterers , it is still possible to do exact calculations .",
    "here we calculate the full lyapunov spectrum in the absence of any external fields . as a preparation",
    "we introduce lyapunov exponents and the lorentz gas in section [ sec : lorentz ] and we discuss the low density approximation . in section [ sec : psf ] we derive an integral expression for the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "then , in section [ sec : spectrum ] , we approximate this expression for high - dimensional systems and investigate its properties . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results and make comparisons to the hard - disk lyapunov spectrum .",

    "it evolves with time , according to @xmath5 .",
    "if the initial conditions are perturbed infinitesimally , by @xmath6 , the system evolves along an infinitesimally different path @xmath7 , specified by @xmath8 in which the matix @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 the lyapunov exponents are the possible average rates of growth of such perturbations , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "if the system is ergodic , it comes arbitrarily close to any point in phase space for all initial conditions except for a set of measure zero .",
    "therefore , the lyapunov exponents are the same for almost all initial conditions .",
    "we will order the exponents according to size , with @xmath12 being the largest and @xmath13 the smallest , as is the convention .",
    "for each exponent there is a corresponding eigenvector of @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics of a purely hamiltonian system are completely invariant under time reversal .",
    "also , for ergodic hamiltonian systems , due to the incompressibility of flow in phase space , the phase - space attractor is invariant under time reversal .",
    "therefore , every tangent - space eigenvector that grows exponentially under time evolution , shrinks exponentially under backward time evolution . as a consequence , since",
    "the lyapunov spectrum does not change under time reversal , there is a negative exponent of equal absolute value for every positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is called the conjugate pairing rule .",
    "we will consider the dilute random lorentz gas .",
    "it is a system with a fixed number @xmath15 of randomly placed spherical scatterers with diameter @xmath16 at a ( small ) density @xmath17 in @xmath0 dimensions . to be specific",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case of non - overlapping scatterers , where , a priori , each configuration without overlap among any two scatterers is equally likely .",
    "we will assume that the system is large .",
    "as long as it is finite our preferred boundary conditions are periodic ones , but our considerations allow taking the infinite system limit , at fixed @xmath17 , without any problem . a single point particle moves between the scatterers , with speed @xmath18 , undergoing a specular reflection at each collision . for given scatterer positions ,",

    "on the tangent trajectory , the perturbation of the precollisional position with respect to the reference trajectory , leads to a perturbation in the collision normal and the collision time , which shows up in the perturbation of the postcollisional velocity .",
    "the perturbation of the collision time also leads to a slight deviation of the postcollisional position difference ( measured at the instant of collision on the tangent trajectory ) from the precollisional one ( measured at the instant of collision on the reference trajectory ) . as a result",

    "pairing rule @xmath38 of them are positive and the remaining @xmath38 are negative with the same absolute values .      to calculate the non - zero lyapunov exponents , one needs to consider what happens to an initial perturbation @xmath39 in tangent space in the limit of infinite time . as an introduction we first review the calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent at low scatterer densities .",
    "an initial perturbation which is not parallel to @xmath34 generically has a non - vanishing component along the most rapidly growing eigenvector of the time evolution operator in tangent space .",
