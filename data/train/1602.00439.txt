    "explaining ferromagnetism from a simple model of itinerant electrons such as the standard hubbard model is a long - standing problem in the condensed matter theory . among many routes leading to ferromagnetism",
    "the so - called flat - band ferromagnetism of mielke and tasaki@xcite is of special interest . on the one hand , many results for mielke - tasaki flat - band ferromagnetism have been obtained rigorously . on the other hand , this mechanism is important for material design , since it opens interesting possibilities to obtain ferromagnetic materials in which magnetic atoms are completely missing . in brief , the mechanism of this kind of ferromagnetism looks as follows.@xcite flat - band ground states ( i.e. , the one - particle states from completely dispersionless band which is the lowest - energy one ) can be considered as one - particle states which are localized within small trapping cells on a lattice.@xcite therefore , exact many - electron ground states at low electron densities can be constructed simply by filling the traps .",
    "importantly , in the case of connected ( overlapping ) traps , electrons being in symmetric spin states avoid the on - site hubbard repulsion , and , as a result , these states remain within the ground - state manifold for @xmath2 with a @xmath3-independent energy .",
    "thus , the ( degenerate ) ground state consists of a set of ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "if the electron density exceeds a threshold value , a macroscopic wrapping ferromagnetic cluster appears and ferromagnetism dominates the ground - state properties of thermodynamically large systems.@xcite this ferromagnetism is robust against perturbation , i.e. , the ferromagnetic state remains stable for slightly perturbed models which have a moderate change in the hopping integrals leading to a slightly dispersive one - electron band.@xcite    the above description of the emergence of ground - state ferromagnetism is based on the assumption , that the trapping cells have common sites , i.e. , the so - called connectivity condition is satisfied for the localized one - electron states . in other words ,",
    "the localized states overlap and this was essential for the proofs in refs .  .",
    "on the other hand , there are lattices which have lowest - energy flat bands but the traps do not have common sites ( nonoverlapping or isolated traps ) .",
    "those flat - band lattices can not support the above described mechanism for ferromagnetism , since the trapped electrons can not be in contact with each other , and , thus are unable to correlate .",
    "hence , flat - band hubbard models with isolated traps do not exhibit ferromagnetism at zero temperature , rather there is a macroscopically degenerate ( i.e. , the degeneracy grows exponentially with the system size ) ground - state manifold , where paramagnetic states dominate.@xcite however , the macroscopically degenerate ground - state manifold is very sensitive to small perturbations which may lead to subtle effects of violations of the flat - band conditions .",
    "this scenario has been investigated in ref .   for the specific example of the frustrated diamond chain .",
    "it was demonstrated that the macroscopically degenerate ground - state manifold with all traps filled by electrons results in a non - magnetic zero - temperature phase,@xcite but small deviations from the ideal flat - band geometry of hopping integrals ( which makes the flat band slightly dispersive ) lead to a fully polarized ferromagnetic many - electron ground state if @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 depends on the strength of the deviation from the ideal geometry .",
    "note that another route to ground - state ferromagnetism without connectivity condition in the flat band was discussed in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper we broaden and generalize our previous study on the dispersion - driven ferromagnetism in flat - band hubbard systems.@xcite as already mentioned above , those studies referred to one particular lattice , namely to an azurite - like@xcite diamond - hubbard chain . moreover",
    ", analytical calculations presented in ref .   were restricted to the fourth - order perturbation theory for a two - cell chain . in the present study",
    "we extend the analytical calculations to higher - orders perturbation theory this way validating the previous results .",
    "more importantly , we consider other lattices with isolated trapping cells , the one - dimensional ladder and the two - dimensional bilayer .",
    "these new lattices have more degrees of freedom to constitute deviations from the ideal flat - band geometry .",
    "thus , we will demonstrate that the dispersion - driven ferromagnetism is a rather general mechanism to establish ferromagnetic ground states in hubbard models having isolated trapping cells in the flat - band limit .",
    "in addition to the analytical perturbation theory , we also perform extensive exact - diagonalization studies .",
    "our analysis will , on the one hand , confirm the conclusions derived from the study of the hubbard diamond chain.@xcite on the other hand , we will discuss further consequences of deviations from the ideal flat - band geometry on ferromagnetism . in particular , we find that in some cases the required threshold on - site repulsion @xmath1 may be quite small , whereas in other cases ferromagnetic ground states do not appear at all .",
    "there are also cases when ferromagnetic ground states appear only , if the acquired bandwidth exceeds a threshold , and then @xmath1 becomes a nonmonotonic function of the bandwidth .",
    "our findings are compactly collected in phase diagrams , obtained both by analytical treatment and exact diagonalization , which indicate the regions of dispersion - driven ground - state ferromagnetism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief description of the models to be considered ( sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) and the methods to be used ( sec .",

    "it is convenient to parameterize the azurite - like distortion as follows : @xmath22 for the ladder / bilayer @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 may be different , but we assume @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( ladder ) or @xmath29 ( bilayer ) .",
    "again it is convenient to introduce the following parameterization : @xmath30 with @xmath31 .    in the distorted systems the lowest flat band with energy @xmath32 acquires a dispersion , i.e. , @xmath33 , resulting in a nonzero bandwidth @xmath34 . in ref .",
    ", the acquired dispersion was characterized by a parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the bandwidth of the dispersive bands for the ideal flat - band geometry ( note that for the diamond chain there are two dispersive bands with identical bandwidth ) .",
    "furthermore , for the diamond chain we have @xmath37 , @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 , where @xmath40 used in ref .",
    "equals to @xmath41 , cf .",
    "( [ 202 ] ) .",
    "however , since for the hubbard ladder / bilayer the acquired bandwidth is not the only relevant parameter that controls the emergence of ferromagnetism , we prefer to use throughout this paper the above introduced parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the diamond chain and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for the ladder / bilayer .",
    "in our study we use an analytical perturbation - theory approach and numerical exact diagonalization .",
    "let us briefly explain these methods .",
    "the starting point of the perturbation theory is the splitting of the hamiltonian @xmath48 of the problem at hand into the main part ( unperturbed hamiltonian ) @xmath49 and the perturbation @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "then we use the perturbation - theory formulas given in ref .",
    "( see also appendix  a ) to determine the influence of the perturbation @xmath50 on the degenerate ground - state manifold .",
    "since @xmath52 is the largest hopping integral and @xmath2 , the main part consists of the hopping terms on the vertical bonds and all on - site repulsion terms .",
    "the perturbation consists of all other hopping terms .",
    "next we have to find all eigenstates and eigenvalues of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath49 . for @xmath5 sites and @xmath53 electrons",
    "there are altogether @xmath54 $ ] eigenstates .",
    "for example , for @xmath55 ladder problems we have 28 , 220 , 1820 , 15504 eigenstates , respectively . in the considered regime ,",
    "i.e. , dominating positive @xmath7 , @xmath2 is sufficiently large , and @xmath56 , the ground state is @xmath57-fold degenerate , i.e. , 4- , 8- , 16- , 32-fold degenerate for @xmath55 .",
    "it has the form : @xmath58 the choice of the concrete linear combinations of states ( [ 301 ] ) used as a starting point of perturbation theory is related to the model with perturbation .",
    "supposing an effective magnetic heisenberg model for the low - energy degrees of freedom,@xcite the choice of ground states of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath49 which account the su(2 ) symmetry of the hubbard hamiltonian is straightforward , for more details see appendix  b. the resulting perturbation - theory formulas up to the sixth order are collected in appendix  a ( see also appendices  c , d , and e ) . it is in order to mention here , that in the small-@xmath3 limit , in addition to the states ( [ 301 ] ) , also states with two electrons in one cell , become relevant . as a result ,",
    "the perturbation theory starting from the set of states ( [ 301 ] ) may fail for @xmath59 , see below .    to perform the fourth and sixth order perturbation theory we use the symbolic computation software _",
    "mathematica_. to implement the symbolic calculation we used the sneg package , see ref .  , for mathematica .",
    "the package handles the non - commutative multiplication of , e.g. , fermionic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this is required to perform the perturbation theory in higher order for larger hubbard clusters . for a compact sketch of the procedure see appendix  f.    for the numerical exact diagonalization we use j.  schulenburg s _",

    "thus , by considering various system sizes the finite - effects can be estimated .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained by two different approaches finally allows to get a consistent description of the ground - state phases of the considered hubbard systems .",

    "( [ 401 ] ) corresponds to an azurite - like deformation.@xcite furthermore , we assume half filling of the lowest nearly flat one - electron band , i.e. , the number of electrons equals the number of cells @xmath56 .",
    "extensive exact - diagonalization calculations for this model were reported in ref .  .",
    "however , the analytical treatment by perturbation theory was restricted to fourth - order calculations for the two - cell diamond chain with open boundary conditions consisting of @xmath63 sites .",
    "( note , that for the special diamond - chain geometry the second - order perturbation theory is not sufficient to describe ground - state ferromagnetism.@xcite ) in this paper we present the sixth - order perturbation theory and consider also a larger cluster consisting of three cells in fourth - order perturbation theory .",
    "that allows to validate the previous lower - order approach and promises a better agreement with exact diagonalization for larger deviations from the ideal flat - band geometry .",
    "the results for the triplet and singlet energies calculated for the cluster of @xmath63 sites with @xmath64 electrons up to the sixth order , @xmath65 are given in appendix  c. from the obtained data one can see that with increasing of the order of perturbation - theory calculations the analytical results for the triplet and singlet energies monotonically approach the exact - diagonalization data from above .",
    "the critical on - site repulsion @xmath1 is determined from the equation @xmath66 . in fourth - order perturbation - theory",
    "we get a compact formula@xcite @xmath67 eq .",
    "( [ 403 ] ) implies that in fourth order @xmath68 depends only on the deviation from the ideal flat - band geometry controlled by @xmath43 , but not on @xmath42 or @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , in sixth order @xmath69 obtained as a solution of the equation @xmath70 has to be calculated numerically , and can not be presented in a compact analytical form .",
    "by contrast to @xmath71 , the sixth - order result @xmath72 weakly depends on @xmath7 , which was also found in our exact - diagonalization results .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath71 and @xmath69 are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident , that the difference between the values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 at least for small @xmath43 , where the perturbation theory is valid , is small ( the difference in fig .",
    "[ f02 ] becomes only visible if @xmath43 exceeds 0.4 ) .",
    "thus , we confirm that the simple equation ( [ 403 ] ) describes the phase boundary surprisingly well .    another way to extend the previous perturbation - theory calculations of ref .",
    "is to enlarge the cluster sizes used for the perturbation theory . for that we consider @xmath75 electrons on the three - cell diamond chain with open boundary conditions which has @xmath76 sites .",
    "already in fourth order the perturbation theory becomes more ambitious , since we have to take into account much more states , see appendix  c. remarkably , for the larger cluster we get the same value of @xmath71 as given in eq .",

    "the fact that eq .  ( [ 403 ] ) has been obtained now from calculations for both two - cell and three - cell diamond chains ( i.e. , for @xmath63 and @xmath76 ) , also explains the good agreement of eq .",

    "[ f03](a ) for the general case qualitatively resembles that for the diamond chain ( cf .",
    "[ f08 ] in appendix  c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetric and semi - symmetric cases are totally unlike .",

    "this can be traced back to the difference in lattice geometries .",

    "that is because for this cluster the level crossing between the sextuplet and the lowest quadruplet takes place at the same @xmath3 as for the crossing of sextuplet and the lowest doublet .    as a first ( remarkable ) outcome we find , that the second - order result @xmath178 again is given by eq .",

    "if ( i ) the flat band acquires a small dispersion this way allowing to the previously localized electrons to correlate and ( ii ) the on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath3 is sufficiently strong the ground state becomes ferromagnetic",

    "thus , for some deformation geometries ferromagnetism does not appear at all , for others it appears already for small @xmath3 ; in some cases @xmath1 is an increasing function of the deformation strength , whereas in others it becomes nonmonotonic .",
    "the mechanism leading to kinetic - energy - driven emergence of ferromagnetism is studied in detail for one - dimensional systems with isolated trapping cells . however , as it is demonstrated for a specific two - dimensional system this mechanism works in higher dimensions as well .",
    "although our analysis refers to finite systems , the observed finite - size behavior indicates convincingly that such a scenario should survive in the thermodynamic limit , too .",
