    "the study on exotic hadron spectroscopy is experiencing a renaissance in the last decade .",
    "more and more charmonium - like and bottomonium - like states ( called @xmath2 ) have been announced by experiments in various processes  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "several charged structures with a hidden @xmath3 or @xmath4 , such as the@xmath5  @xcite , @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite , and @xmath8  @xcite were observed by experiments , which would be exotic state candidates .",
    "very recently , the d0 collaboration observed a narrow structure @xmath1 in the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum with @xmath10 significance  @xcite . the mass and width are measured to be @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 mev , respectively .",
    "the quark components of the decaying final state @xmath13 are @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , which requires @xmath1 should be a structure with four different valence quarks .    after the discovery of @xmath1 , several theoretical investigations are carried out in order to understand its underlying structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mass and decay constant of @xmath1 were computed within the two - point sum rule method using the diquark - antidiquark interpolating current .",
    "the mass and pole residue are studied with the qcd sum rules in  @xcite .",
    "its mass spectrum was also calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite using diquark - antidiquark type interpolating current . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors estimated the partial decay width @xmath16 with @xmath1 being an @xmath17-wave @xmath18 molecular state .",
    "it is necessary to study some other possibilities , before we claim that @xmath1 is a genuine particle , such as tetraquark or molecular state .",
    "some non - resonance explanations have ever been proposed to connect resonance - like peaks with kinematic singularities induced by the rescattering effects  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that sometimes it is not necessary to introduce a genuine resonance to describe a resonance - like structure , because some kinematic singularities of the rescattering amplitudes will behave themselves as bumps in the invariant mass distributions . in this work",
    ", we are trying to use the so - called triangle singularity ( ts ) mechanism to describe the observation of @xmath1 .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section ii , the ts mechanism is briefly introduced ; in section iii , we discuss several rescattering processes where the ts can be present and simulate the resonance .",
    "a brief summary is given in section iv .",
    "is @xmath19 ( @xmath20@xmath211 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "the momentum symbols also represent the corresponding particles . ]    the possible manifestation of the ts was first noticed in 1960s .",
    "it is found that the ts s of rescattering amplitudes can mimic resonance structures in the corresponding invariant mass distributions  @xcite .",
    "this offers a non - resonance explanation about the resonance - like peaks observed in experiments .",
    "unfortunately , most of the proposed cases in 1960s were lack of experimental support .",
    "the ts mechanism was rediscovered in recent years and used to interpret some exotic phenomena , such as the largely isospin - violation processes , the production of some exotic states and so on  @xcite .    for the triangle diagram in fig .",
    "[ tsmechanism ] , all of the three internal lines can be on - shell simultaneously under some special kinematic configurations .",
    "this case corresponds to the leading landau singularity of the triangle diagram , and this leading landau singularity is usually called the ts .",
    "the physical picture concerning the ts mechanism can be understood like this : the initial particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 firstly scatter into particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 , then the particle @xmath26 emitted from @xmath24 catches up with @xmath25 , and finally @xmath24 and @xmath25 will rescatter into particles @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the rescattering diagram can be interpreted as a classical process in space - time with the presence of ts , and the ts will be located on the physical boundary of the rescattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the ts mechanism is very sensitive to the kinematic configurations of rescattering diagrams .",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine in which kinematic region the ts can be present . in fig .",
    "[ tsmechanism ] , we define the invariants @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the locations of ts can be determined by solving the so - called landau equations @xcite . for the diagram in fig .",
    "[ tsmechanism ] , if we fix the internal masses @xmath19 , the external invariants @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we can obtain the solutions of ts in @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 .",

    ", we further define the normal threshold @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and the critical value @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath34 ( @xmath32 ) as follows @xcite , @xmath46 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & s_{2n}=(m_1+m_3)^2,\\ s_{2c}=(m_1+m_3)^2 + \\frac{m_3}{m_2}[(m_2-m_1)^2-s_3].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we fix @xmath33 and the internal masses @xmath47 , when @xmath34 increases from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , @xmath39 will move from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",

    "this is the kinematic region where the ts can be present .",
    "the discrepancies between normal and anomalous thresholds can also be used to represent the ts kinematic region .",

    "@xcite , it was argued that for the single channel rescattering process , when the corresponding resonance - production tree diagram is added coherently to the triangle rescattering diagram , the effect of the triangle diagram is nothing more than a multiplication of the singularity from the tree diagram by a phase factor . therefore the singularities of triangle diagram can not produce obvious peaks in the dalitz plot projections .",
