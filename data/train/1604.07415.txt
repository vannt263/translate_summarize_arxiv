    "one of the most challenging problems in contemporary physics is presented by the question : whence the mass of a hadron and hence that of the bulk of visible material in the universe ? numerical simulations of lattice - regularised quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have produced information on the hadron mass spectrum @xcite ; but such analyses do not readily supply an intuitive understanding of the origin of that mass and its distribution within hadrons . notwithstanding that , it is clear the answer does not lie with the higgs boson , for if one measures its contribution to the proton mass , @xmath2 , via the values it generates for the valence - quark current - masses , which explicitly violate both the conformal invariance and chiral symmetry of classical qcd , the higgs is responsible for less - than 2% of @xmath2 . instead , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is the key @xcite .",
    "dcsb is a crucial emergent phenomenon in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it is quite probably tied closely to the confinement of gluons and quarks , and also simultaneously responsible for both the nambu - goldstone boson character of the ( almost ) massless pion and the roughly 1gev value of @xmath2 . uncovering the manner by which these features of nature are realised",
    "has long been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical activity , some of which is reviewed in refs.@xcite .",
    "much of this work has focused on the ground - state pion , its structure and interactions .",
    "for instance , it has revealed that dcsb is responsible for a marked broadening of this meson s leading - twist parton distribution amplitude ( pda ) @xcite , and also those of other meson ground - states @xcite , an effect which provides a plausible explanation of modern data on pion elastic and transition form factors @xcite .",
    "the impact of dcsb on the properties of hadron excited states is less well explored and understood .    of particular interest",
    "is the fact that , owing to dcsb , nambu - goldstone modes are the only pseudoscalar mesons to possess a nonzero leptonic decay constant in the chiral limit : the decay constants of their radial excitations vanish @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radial quantum number ( @xmath5 is the ground state ) and @xmath6 is the renormalisation - group - invariant ( rgi ) current - quark mass .",
    "this result follows from the general form of the gell - mann  oakes - renner relation for isospin - nonzero pseudoscalars @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 labels the meson , @xmath9 are the current - masses of its valence - quarks , @xmath10 is the meson s leptonic decay constant , obtained from the pseudovector projection of its bethe - salpeter wave function onto the origin in configuration space , and @xmath11 is the rgi analogue obtained via pseudoscalar projection @xcite .",
    ", must both be a natural outcome in any framework with a genuine connection to qcd .",
    "if fine - tuning is required to achieve either of these features in a given approach , then that approach is inconsistent with basic dynamics , symmetries and symmetry - breaking patterns of qcd .",
    "for example , it is straightforward to achieve @xmath12 in quantum mechanical models , but impossible to express the quadratic growth of @xmath13 with current - quark mass , _",
    "i.e_. the complete content of eq .. equally , models founded in quantum mechanics typically produce a suppression of the decay constants of radially excited states , owing to zeros in the associated bound - state wave functions , _",
    "e.g_.  a schrdinger equation treatment of positronium @xmath14-decays yields the following pattern of decay - strengths relative to the ground - state : @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 ; etc . however , such models can not yield a vanishing value for even one decay constant , much less all of them",
    ". it is known that dcsb places severe constraints on the wave function of the ground - state pion @xcite ; but our last few observations emphasise , via eq .",
    ", that it must also impose extraordinary constraints on the chiral - limit wave function for every excited - state pseudoscalar meson .",
    "of course , the nature of a wave function in quantum field theory depends on the approach adopted for its analysis ; and only wave functions defined using light - front quantisation can strictly provide a connection between dynamical properties of the underlying relativistic quantum field theory and notions familiar from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics @xcite . with a light - front wave function in hand , however , one can translate features that arise purely through the infinitely - many - body nature of relativistic quantum field theory into images whose interpretation is seemingly more straightforward .    a natural framework for deriving eqs .",
    ", , and elucidating and expressing their impression on hadron structure and interactions , is provided by the symmetry - preserving analysis of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite",
    ". this approach yields poincar - covariant bethe - salpeter wave functions , which do not have a probability interpretation .",
    "however , methods have recently been developed which enable these covariant wave functions to be projected onto the light - front @xcite , supplying predictions for the leading - twist pdas of ground - state mesons which are practically indistinguishable from those obtained by analysing simulations of lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) @xcite .",
    "thus it is now possible to express the parton content of eq . in a manner which can place valuable constraints on all approaches that may directly be connected with the light - front . in this connection , we focus herein on computing the leading - twist pdas of the first radial excitations of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons .",
    "our manuscript is composed as follows .",
    "section[dsebse ] describes calculations of the bethe - salpeter wave functions for the radially - excited @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons , and their masses and leptonic decay constants .",
    "section  [ pdasec ] begins with a brief synopsis of the behaviour to be expected of pdas associated with meson radial excitations in the absence of dcsb , and then continues with a detailed explanation of both the method by which these pdas can be computed from symmetry - preserving dse solutions and the results obtained therewith .",
    "a summary and perspective are presented in sec.[summary ] .",
    "in order to reach our goal , we must first compute the bethe - salpeter amplitudes associated with the radially - excited @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons ; and to achieve that , it is necessary to settle on a truncation of qcd s dses . as explained elsewhere",
    "@xcite , eqs . , are guaranteed in any symmetry preserving truncation . for our immediate purposes , therefore , it is sufficient to use the simplest ; namely , rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation , in which case the renormalised gap- and bethe - salpeter - equations are , respectively : @xmath19 where : @xmath20 represents a poincar - invariant regularisation of the integral , with @xmath21 the ultraviolet regularization mass - scale ; @xmath22 is the quark wave function renormalisation constant , with @xmath23 the renormalisation scale ; @xmath24 is the landau - gauge free - gauge - boson propagator ; one can choose @xmath25 without loss of generality in this poincar covariant approach ; and @xmath26 specifies the interaction , with @xmath27 a bounded , monotonically - decreasing regular continuation of the perturbative - qcd running coupling to all values of spacelike-@xmath28 , and @xmath29 an _ ansatz _ for the interaction at infrared momenta , such that @xmath30 @xmath31gev@xmath32 .",

    "a mass - independent scheme is useful and can be implemented by fixing all renormalisation constants in the chiral limit .",

    "i.e_. in a given channel , eq.([ladderbse ] ) has solutions only at particular , isolated values of @xmath42 . at these values , solving the equation produces the associated meson s bethe - salpeter amplitude .",

    "the radial - excitation curves in this panel exhibit a distinctive pattern of support : @xmath203 is plainly dilated with respect to @xmath204 , with a significant amount of strength shifted to the endpoints , analogous to the pattern seen in the ground state ; and @xmath205 is markedly distorted toward @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) . these images help in understanding the top panel , which is now seen to confirm that @xmath208 is dilated with respect to @xmath199 and @xmath209 is distorted , with its minimum located at @xmath210 , and    @xmath211    values which may be compared with @xmath212 . evidently , therefore , as in the ground - state @xmath176 , the @xmath213-quark carries more of the bound - state s momentum than the lighter @xmath214-quark and flavour - symmetry breaking is a 20% effect . moreover , here , as in so many other cases @xcite , it is the flavour - dependence of dcsb that determines the strength of @xmath215-flavour breaking , not the current - quark mass - difference generated by the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is worth reiterating at this point that all dse numerical results reported above were obtained using rl truncation .",
    "based on analyses of pseudoscalar - meson ground - states , we anticipate that the more realistic dcsb - improved truncation ( see ref.@xcite and appendixa.2 , ref.@xcite ) will produce pdas for the radial excitations that exhibit less dilation and less @xmath216-quark/@xmath214-quark distortion ; but it wo nt have any material qualitative impact on our results .    in closing this section it is worth remarking that , owing to charge - conjugation invariance and the @xmath217 vector ward - green - takahashi identity @xcite , the leptonic decay constant is zero for any and all states on the @xmath218 trajectory constituted from equal - mass valence - quarks , whether ground - state , radial excitation or hybrid .",
    "this decay constant is the vector - projection of the scalar meson s bethe - salpeter wave function onto the origin in configuration space , _ viz_.  the zeroth moment of the scalar meson s pda . as a consequence ,",
    "scalar meson pdas must also exhibit interesting features .",
    "we computed the parton distribution amplitudes ( pdas ) of the first radial excitations of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons : @xmath208 and @xmath219 , respectively , where @xmath220 is the valence - quark s light - front momentum fraction .",
    "the properties and structure of ground states in these channels are strongly influenced by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) and this is also true of the radial excitations , in some ways more strikingly . like the ground - states",
    ", the excited - state pdas are dilated with respect to the appropriate conformal - limit pda and the distribution associated with the @xmath81-meson is skewed toward the heavier valence-(anti)quark .",
    "in addition , however , @xmath208 and @xmath219 are not positive definite [ fig.[pdas ] ] : in each case there is a large domain of negative support , which contains the point @xmath221 .",
    "this feature is a remarkable , novel consequence of dcsb , which owes to the fact that dcsb requires the leptonic decay constant of all pseudoscalar - meson radial excitations to vanish in the chiral limit [ eq . ] .",
    "it was possible to expose this feature herein because we used a symmetry - preserving truncation of qcd s two - valence - body bound - state problem , realised explicitly in a rainbow - ladder truncation of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) .",
    "this framework preserves the one - loop renormalisation group behaviour of qcd , so that current - quark masses have a direct connection with the parameters in qcd s action and the dressed - quark mass - functions , @xmath222 , are independent of the renormalisation point . likewise",
    ", the renormalisation point can be fixed unambiguously , as in lattice - qcd . moreover , in working in the continuum and computing bethe - salpeter wave functions directly , the dses enable one to deliver a prediction for the pointwise behaviour of the pdas on the full domain @xmath223 $ ] .",
    "capitalising on these features , we ensured that our results genuinely express the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd and , hence , the impact of dcsb is abundantly clear .",
    "the analysis herein highlights that dcsb is expressed dramatically in the entire collection of pseudoscalar mesons constituted from light - quarks .",
    "consequently , so long as its impact is empirically evident in the pseudoscalar members of a given spectrum level , it is unlikely that chiral symmetry is restored in any of the hadrons that populate this level .",
    "our results were obtained using the simplest symmetry - preserving truncation of the two - valence - body problem .",
    "they will not change qualitatively with the use of a more sophisticated truncation ; but it is nevertheless worth documenting the quantitative changes , and delivering predictions in future that may reasonably be considered to be definitive .",
    "detailed study of pdas characterising @xmath99 radial excitations of pseudoscalar mesons may provide further insights , too , because , _",
    "e.g_.  the decay constants of these systems also vanish in the chiral limit , but their bethe - salpeter wave functions possess an additional zero with each level of excitation . likewise , calculation of the pdas describing scalar mesons should prove instructive , given the symmetry constraints on their leptonic decay constants . additionally , a study of the pdas characterising vector - meson radial excitations is also worthwhile .",
    "the leptonic decay constants of these systems do not vanish , and it is thus possible that the associated pdas will bear some similarity to those computed using quantum mechanical models . checking that possibility will serve , _",
    "inter alia _ , the valuable purpose of assisting in charting the domain of validity of such models .",
