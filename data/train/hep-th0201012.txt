    "but even that observational evidences of cosmological rotation have been reported @xcite-@xcite , they are still subject of controversy .    from the analysis of microwave background anisotropy collins and hawking @xcite and barrow , juszkiewicz and sonoda @xcite have found some very tight limits of the cosmological vorticity , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the actual rotation period of our universe and @xmath2 years is the hubble time .",
    "therefore our present day universe is rotating very slowly , if at all .    from a theoretical point of view in 1949 gdel @xcite gave his famous example of a rotating cosmological solution to the einstein gravitational field equations .",

    "gdel also discussed the possibility of a cosmic explanation of the galactic rotation @xcite .",
    "this rotating solution has attracted considerable interest because the corresponding universes possess the property of closed time - like curves .",
    "the investigation of rotating and rotating - expanding universes generated a large amount of literature in the field of general relativity , the combination of rotation with expansion in realistic cosmological models being one of the most difficult tasks in cosmology ( see @xcite for a recent review of the expansion - rotation problem in general relativity )",
    ". hence rotating solutions of the gravitational field equations can not be excluded _ a priori_. but",
    "this raises the question of why the universe rotates so slowly .",
    "this problem can also be naturally solved in the framework of the inflationary model .",
    "ellis and olive @xcite and grn and soleng @xcite pointed out that if the universe came into being as a mini - universe of planck dimensions and went directly into an inflationary epoch driven by a scalar field with a flat potential , due to the non - rotation of the false vacuum and the exponential expansion during inflation the cosmic vorticity has decayed by a factor of about @xmath7 .",
    "the most important diluting effect of the order of @xmath8 is due to the relative density of the rotating fluid compared to the non - rotating decay products of the false vacuum @xcite .",
    "inflationary cosmology also ruled out the possibility that the vorticity of galaxies and stars be of cosmic origin .",
    "the possibility of incorporating a slowly rotating universe into the framework of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type metrics has been considered by bayin and cooperstock @xcite , who obtained the restrictions imposed by the field equations on the matter angular velocity .",
    "they also shown that uniform rotation is incompatible with the dust filled ( zero pressure ) and with the radiation dominated universe .",
    "bayin @xcite has also shown that the field equations admit solutions for a special class of nonseparable rotation functions of the matter distribution .",
    "the investigation of the first order rotational perturbations of flat frw type universes proved to be useful in the study of string cosmological models with dilaton and axion fields @xcite .",
    "the form of the rotation equation imposes strong constraints on the form of the dilaton field potential @xmath9 , restricting the allowed forms to two : the trivial case @xmath10 and the exponential type potential .",
    "recently , randall and sundrum @xcite have pointed out that a scenario with an infinite fifth dimension in the presence of a brane can generate a theory of gravity which mimics purely four - dimensional gravity , both with respect to the classical gravitational potential and with respect to gravitational radiation .",
    "the gravitational self - couplings are not significantly modified in this model .",
    "this result has been obtained from the study of a single 3-brane embedded in five dimensions , with the 5d metric given by @xmath11 , which can produce a large hierarchy between the scale of particle physics and gravity due to the appearance of the warp factor .",
    "even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard 4d gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "in contrast to the compactified case , this follows because the near - brane geometry traps the massless graviton .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time .",
    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model was inspired by superstring theory .",
    "the ten - dimensional @xmath12 heterotic string theory , which contains the standard model of elementary particle , could be a promising candidate for the description of the real universe .",
    "this theory is connected with an eleven - dimensional theory compactified on the orbifold @xmath13 @xcite . in this model",
    "we have two separated ten - dimensional manifolds .",
    "the static rs solution has been extended to time - dependent solutions and their cosmological properties have been extensively studied @xcite-@xcite ( for a review of dynamics and geometry of brane universes see @xcite ) .",
    "the effective gravitational field equations on the brane world , in which all the matter forces except gravity are confined on the 3-brane in a 5-dimensional space - time with @xmath14-symmetry have been obtained , by using an elegant geometric approach , by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki @xcite . the correct signature for gravity",
    "is provided by the brane with positive tension . if the bulk space - time is exactly anti - de sitter , generically the matter on the brane is required to be spatially homogeneous .",
    "the electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor @xmath15 gives the leading order corrections to the conventional einstein equations on the brane .",
    "the effect of the dilaton field in the bulk can also be taken into account in this approach @xcite .",
    "the linearized perturbation equations in the generalized rs model have been obtained , by using the covariant nonlinear dynamical equations for the gravitational and matter fields on the brane , by maartens @xcite .",
    "the behavior of an anisotropic bianchi type i brane - world in the presence of inflationary scalar fields has been considered by maartens , sahni and saini @xcite . a systematic analysis , using dynamical systems techniques , of the qualitative behavior of the frw , bianchi type i and v cosmological models in the rs brane world scenario , with matter on the brane obeying a barotropic equation of state has been performed by campos and sopuerta @xcite . in particular , they constructed the state spaces for these models and discussed what new critical points appear , the occurrence of bifurcations and the dynamics of the anisotropy . the general exact solution of the field equations for an anisotropic brane with bianchi type i and v geometry , with perfect fluid and scalar fields as matter sources has been found in @xcite . expanding bianchi type i and v",
    "brane - worlds always isotropize , although there could be intermediate stages in which the anisotropy grows . in spatially homogeneous brane world",
    "cosmological models the initial singularity is isotropic and hence the initial conditions problem is solved @xcite .",
    "consequently , these models do not exhibit mixmaster or chaotic - like behavior close to the initial singularity @xcite .",
    "realistic brane - world cosmological models require the consideration of more general matter sources to describe the evolution and dynamics of the very early universe .",
    "hence the effect of the bulk viscosity of the matter on the brane have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "limits on the initial anisotropy induced by the 5-dimensional kaluza - klein graviton stresses by using the cmb anisotropies have been obtained by barrow and maartens @xcite .",
    "anisotropic bianchi type i brane - worlds with a pure magnetic field and a perfect fluid have also been analyzed @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the effects of the rotational perturbations on a brane world with frw type geometry .",
    "a similar case was also considered in @xcite . assuming the rotation is slow and by keeping only the first order rotational terms in the field equations , a rotation equation describing the time and space evolution of the metric perturbations is obtained .",
    "this equation also contains the angular velocity of the matter rotating on the brane . by assuming that the metric perturbation and the matter angular velocity are separable functions of the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the mathematical consistency of the rotation equation leads to some restrictions on the functional form of the angular velocity .",
    "in particular a class of solutions of the field equations leads to a barotropic brane - world cosmological model , with a non - linear pressure - energy density dependence . but generally , similar to the general relativistic case , the rotational perturbations will rapidly decay due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , this general result is valid only in the presence of the dark energy term , describing the influence of the five - dimensional bulk on the brane .",
    "if this term is zero , rotational perturbations in a very high density ( stiff ) cosmological fluid decay only in the so - called case of the `` perfect dragging '' .",

    "for high densities the non - linear effects become important , showing that the quadratic effects due to the effects of the five - dimensional bulk also modify the equation of state of the matter .",

    "since @xmath217 for all times , the evolution of the models is purely inflationary .",
    "however , due to the corrections from the extra - dimensions , the initial period of the inflationary phase can be associated to an increase in the energy - density of the universe .    in all these cases , due to the rapid expansion of the brane - world",
    ", there is a fast time decay of the angular velocity @xmath218 . since in the large time limit",
    "the scale factor is of the form @xmath219 , in this brane world model one obtains an exponential decay of the cosmic vorticity .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the evolution of the rotational perturbations in the framework of brane world cosmology . as a first step",
    "we have obtained the basic dynamical equation governing the temporal variation and spatial distribution of the metric perturbation function @xmath57 .",
    "this equation also contains the angular velocity of the slowly rotating matter . from the consistency condition of the rotation equation",
    "one can obtain some restrictions on the admissible mathematical form of @xmath220 . as a general result we have shown that in the presence of dark energy , describing the effects of the bulk on the brane , rotational perturbations always decay for the slowly rotating brane .",
    "but for a vanishing dark energy term , rotational perturbations do not decay for very high density stiff matter with @xmath104 , except for the case of the perfect dragging .",
    "hence the dark energy term could have play an important role in suppressing the vorticity of the very early universe .    in order to find the time evolution of the four - velocities of the particles on the brane we consider the dynamics of a test particle in the perturbed metric ( [ r6 ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath221 , where @xmath43 are the components of the four - velocity and the christoffel symbols @xmath222 are computed from the metric . to simplify the calculations we consider only the first order corrections to the metric in @xmath58 and assume that test particles have small velocities , thus retaining only terms which are linear in velocity .",
    "consequently we obtain @xmath223    by integrating eqs .",
    "( [ vel ] ) we find @xmath224 with @xmath225 constants of integration .",
    "@xmath226 can be set to zero without altering the physical structure . in the limit of large @xmath16 , @xmath227",

    "@xmath230 the test particle will have shifted in azimuth by @xmath231 , having an angular velocity @xmath232 .",
    "present - day observations impose a strong restriction on the numerical value of the angular velocity of the universe of the form @xmath233 . hence in realistic cosmological models",
    "the angular velocity must tend to zero in the large time limit .",
    "the condition of the mathematical consistency of the rotation equation also leads to a specific brane world cosmological model , with the equation of state of the matter given in a parametric form . in the high density regime",
    "the pressure - energy density dependence is nonlinear .",
    "the presence of the dark energy term has major implications on the time evolution of physical parameters . due to the presence of @xmath51 , the energy density and pressure of the matter on the brane",
    "have a maximum .",
    "the increase in the energy density from zero to a maximum value can model the energy transfer from the bulk to the zero - density brane , thus leading to the possibility of a phenomenological description of matter creation on the brane .",
    "if the dark energy term is zero , the singularity in the scale factor is associated to a singular behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath44 . in the large time limit , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , with the pressure @xmath236 . since for ordinary matter @xmath44",
    "can not be smaller than zero , it follows that in this limit @xmath3 must be zero , condition which leads to @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "therefore the de sitter solution is an attractor for this brane world model . independently on the initial state , the universe ends in an inflationary phase .    on the other hand one must point out that the curvature of the brane , described by the parameter @xmath239 does not play any significant role in the time evolution of this brane - world model .",
    "since @xmath240 is absorbed in the arbitrary constant @xmath241 ( which in fact is the most important parameter of the model ) , the dynamics of the matter on the brane is independent on the three - dimensional geometry of the universe .",
    "however , the knowledge of the spatial distribution of the angular velocity could , at least in principle , allow for the determination of the separation constant @xmath147 .",
    "if the numerical value and sign of @xmath147 would be known , then the effects of the curvature of the brane on the temporal dynamics could also be obtained .",
    "but due to the exponential increase in the scale factor , the universe ends in a non - rotating state with a flat geometry .",
    "since the equation of state of matter is unusual ( even in the extreme limit of high densities the equation of state of ordinary matter is still linear with @xmath242 ) , it is natural to assume that in this cosmological model the initial matter content of the universe on the brane consists from a field rather than ordinary matter .",
    "the best candidate is a scalar field @xmath243 , with @xmath244 and @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is the self - interaction potential .",
    "then the time evolution of the scalar field can be immediately obtained from @xmath247 , while the potential is given by @xmath248 . with the use of eqs.([solut1])-([solutf ] ) one can easily obtain the time dependence of the scalar field and scalar field potential for each class of solutions .",
    "the scalar field drives the universe into an inflationary era . in this case solutions with negative pressure",
    "are also allowed . in the limit of large times ,",
    "since the field satisfies the equation of state @xmath249 , we obtain @xmath250 and @xmath251 . for the scalar field potential we find @xmath252 , and , in the de sitter limit",
