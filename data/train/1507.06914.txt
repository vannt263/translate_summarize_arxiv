    "motion of inclusions or probe - particles through a medium is accompanied by the medium perturbation ( e.g. , perturbation of its density ) that can be manifested in the form of a trace induced by the inclusions .",
    "the medium perturbation can , in turn , induce a non - equilibrium interaction between the inclusions .",
    "such interaction is responsible , in particular , for the coherent part of the collective friction force as well as for the formation of possible dissipative structures in an ensemble of the inclusions .",
    "the nature of the medium perturbation and the properties of the induced non - equilibrium interaction are defined by the properties of the medium ( e.g. , by its nonlinearity ) and the mechanism of energy losses .",
    "the perturbation can be manifested as vortices , cherenkov radiation , local phase transitions , including examples in hydrodynamics @xcite , optics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , quantum liquids and bose condensates @xcite , etc .    in dissipative media",
    ", the induced interaction between inclusions can conditionally be divided into reactive and dissipative parts . in the simplest case ,",
    "when the speed of a probe - particle is rather small , e.g. , smaller than that of the sound , and the hydrodynamic effects can be neglected , the trace can be described in the diffusive approximation @xcite .",
    "the diffusive trace may be of large spatial and temporal extensions with power - law damping ( see @xcite ) that characterizes the long - time memory of the medium about the particle passage .",
    "the long - living particle wakes , in turn , lead to the long - range effective dissipative interaction between the particles @xcite .",
    "this can be qualitatively illustrated using the linear response approximation : for a linear medium , e.g. , one described in the linear hydrodynamic approximation , the inclusion wake associated with dissipative part of the density perturbation , @xmath0 , and the dissipative force exerted on the inclusion by the medium @xmath1 are determined by the imaginary part of the linear response @xmath2 on the potential @xmath3 of the inclusion moving with velocity @xmath4 .",
    "for the linear response of the drude  maxwell type , the diffusive limit gives @xmath5 , as it is , e.g. , for fermi liquid @xcite . in this case",
    ", the density perturbation induced by a single probe - particle corresponds to the dipole polarization @xmath6 of the medium around the particle .",

    "maxwell form of the linear response is typical for many systems , resembling results can be obtained , e.g. , for a probe - particle in a quantum liquid @xcite or for a magnetic impurity moving in a ferromagnetic medium @xcite .",
    "the linear response approximation gives only a qualitative , or illustrative , picture of the medium perturbation and leads to incorrect results for trace , dissipative interaction and , in general , does not give adequate description of the non - linear media @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we examine the dissipative interaction between inclusions induced by their trace in a nonlinear medium resorting to an example of the brownian gas with short - range inter - particle repulsion ( the hard - core - type interaction ) . in this case , the dissipative interaction between inclusions is often called the non - equilibrium depletion or entropic interaction , e.g. , @xcite .    at the equilibrium , the depletion interaction is usually short - range ; its spatial range is of the order of the characteristic length scale of the medium particles @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the non - equilibrium forces between the impurities may exhibit long - range behavior due to a long - living diffusive trace induced by their motion @xcite .",
    "in addition , such forces often have unusual properties , e.g. , they violate the newton s third law @xcite",
    ". the non - newtonian behavior of the non - equilibrium depletion force was demonstrated at low gas concentrations when interaction between the gas particles is negligible @xcite .    to describe the non - equilibrium depletion force for a gas of interacting particles",
    ", we turn to the simplest model of a lattice gas , when each lattice site can be occupied only by one particle .",
    "even such a short - range interaction results in a number of unexpected kinetic effects , e.g. , the `` back correlations '' effect @xcite , drifting spatial structures @xcite , effects of `` negative '' mass transport @xcite , and the dissipative pairing effect for tracers passing through a lattice gas @xcite .",
    "an important mechanism often underlying such kinetic phenomena is the blockade or jamming effect .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the blockade effect implicates significant changes in the shape of an obstacle trace .",
    "the trace structures for the cases of an impurity moving in a lattice gas and a fixed impurity ( or an obstacle ) in a gas flow do not coincide in general . in particular , the obstacle trace can take atypical form characterized by switching of its direction depending on the equilibrium gas concentration .",
    "usually , the profile of the gas perturbation induced by a moving inclusion has a dense localized region ahead of the inclusion and a long low - density tail behind it which damps according to a power law , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , for an obstacle in a gas flow , the gas perturbation profile can take a reversed structure with an extended dense region ahead of the obstacle and a localized low - density region in its wake @xcite .",
    "this switching of the profile shape ( or wake `` direction '' ) is caused by the effect of particles blockade ahead of the obstacle and is possible in a flowing dense gas .",
    "since the dissipative , or wake - mediated , interaction depends on the structure of gas density perturbation around the obstacles , see , e.g. , @xcite , we may expect that this wake inversion has to affect the dissipative interaction between the obstacles .    in this paper",
    "we show that the short - range repulsive interaction between gas particles is responsible not only for the obstacle wake switching with increasing gas concentration but also for the sign change of the non - equilibrium depletion interaction between the obstacles , e.g. , switching from effective attraction to repulsion .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : inversion ] we show that possibility of the wake and effective interaction switching follows directly from the so - called `` particle - hole '' symmetry @xcite of the kinetic equations for a lattice gas .",
    "further , in secs .  [ sec : estimates ] and [ sec : asymtotics ] , we show that the nonlinear blockade effect is essential near the obstacle surface and for closely located obstacles . due to this effect , the gas density perturbation takes the pronounced step - like form .",
    "far from the inclusions , where the nonlinear effects can be neglected , we qualitatively describe asymptotic behaviors of the wake and of the non - equilibrium depletion forces between widely spaced inclusions .",
    "these asymptotic behaviors are multipole which is associated with the anisotropic screened coulomb - like potential .    in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize the results and make some concluding remarks .    in order to demonstrate the above mentioned phenomena , we use the mean - field and the long - wavelength approximations , neglecting the short - range correlations and fluctuations in the gas , see @xcite .",
