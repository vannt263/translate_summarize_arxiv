    "in many - body physics , the correlation function plays a fundamental role . especially in theoretical studies , the understanding on many physical phenomena are based on the calculation of the corresponding correlation functions@xcite . for instance , to investigate the magnetic properties of a system , people often calculate the spin - spin correlation function to learn the possible magnetic order . in 1d case ,",
    "the system has a ferromagnetic order if the @xmath0 mode is dominant , and an anti - ferromagnetic order if the @xmath1 mode is dominant .",
    "the long - range behavior of the correlation function is associated with the symmetry - breaking in the system , which is an important concept in the understanding of continuous phase transitions .",
    "that is , for a certain operator , its non - vanishing value at a long distance denotes a symmetry - broken phase which usually occurs in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "mathematically , if the correlation function @xmath2 is a constant in the infinite @xmath3 limit , we say that the state has a long - range order .",
    "the operator @xmath4 can then be taken as the order parameter to describe the corresponding phase .    traditionally , to find an appropriate order parameter for a certain phase",
    ", people often resort to other methods such as group theory and the renormalization group analysis .",
    "nevertheless , these methods can not always help us to find the correct form of the order parameter .",
    "hence a method to derive the order parameter systematically is very instructive . using the variational approach , furukawa _ _",
    "et al__@xcite proposed a scheme to derive the order parameter .",
    "while the scheme is promising , it still needs the knowledge of the degenerated states that lead to the symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "instead , we proposed recently a scheme to derive the order parameter from the spectrum of the reduced density matrix of the ground state directly @xcite .",
    "differ from furukawa s scheme , our approach is not variational , and needs only the knowledge of the ground state .    in this paper",

    "then , we apply our scheme to the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) in section [ sec : ehm ] and [ sec : ehm2 ] .",
    "we show that even without any knowledge of the symmetry of the system , we can derive the exact forms of the order parameters which show long - range correlations in the ground state of the model .",

    "the hubbard type models has been served as a prototype in condensed matter physics to study the electron correlation effect in solids . especially in many cases where the long - range coulomb interaction has significant importance , like in quasi one - dimensional organic solids such as conjugated polymers @xcite and charge transfer crystals @xcite",

    "it was shown analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite the existence of spin - density waves ( sdw ) , charge - density waves ( cdw ) , phase separation ( ps ) , singlet superconducting ( ss ) and the triplet superconducting ( ts ) phases in the model . using concepts from quantum information theory as a tool , it is also shown that the local entanglement @xcite was able to obtain the cdw , sdw and ps phases .",
    "in addition to these three phases , the block - block entanglement can also witness the ss phase @xcite .",
    "besides the phases mentioned above , there are also studies pointed out the existence of the bond - order waves phase(bow ) in the model .",
    "however , whether this bow exists as a narrow region or just a line in the ground state phase diagram is still a controversial problem @xcite .    at this point ,",
    "let us first forget about the result from previous studies and suppose we know nothing about the nature of the phases . to find the potential order existing in the ground state of the model , we need to first examine if the ground state exist a long - range correlation or not .",
    "while we do not know the form of any order parameters , we can still use the mutual information , a concept borrowed from quantum information science , to measure the total correlation between two arbitrary blocks in the system .",

    "it has been shown that the existence of the long - range order means that there is a non - vanishing mutual information at a long distance @xcite .",

    "on the two sides far away from @xmath172 , the largest weight would correspond to sdw and cdw respectively as expected from previous analysis .",
    "however , around @xmath172 , the off - diagonal matrix element in @xmath200 and @xmath201 are dominating instead .",
    "if we just pick this dominating weight to define the order parameter , we have @xmath212 as mentioned before , the system possess up - down spin symmetry .",
    "we could take @xmath213 , and then separate the operator into the real and imaginary part .",
    "we have @xmath214 either the first term or the second term in the bracket above , or their linear combination can be taken as the order parameter .",
    "let s take the real part as the order parameter , i.e @xmath215 in terms of the fermion creation and annihilation operators , we have @xmath216 which is the conventional order parameter that has been used to investigate the bow in the extended hubbard model @xcite .",
    "we summarize our scheme of constructing the order parameter in the following : ( i ) calculate the mutual information to see whether there exists any long - range correlation in the system .",
    "choose the minimum size of the block where the mutual information is non - vanishing for two blocks separated by a large distance .",
    "( ii ) calculate the difference between the diagonal matrix elements of the two block reduced density matrix and the product of the diagonal matrix elements of two single block reduced density matrix .",
    "this is to single out the correlating elements from other noise due to the finite size effect .",
    "( iii ) obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the single block reduced density matrix . construct the order parameter from the heavy weighted eigenstates",
    "apply traceless condition and cut - off condition to narrow down the choice .",
    "( iv ) calculate the correlation function using the derived order parameter and study the mode of it .",
    "with the scheme proposed , we have derived the order parameters which show long - range correlation in the ground state of the 1d ehm without using any empirical knowledge .",
    "such an application confirmed that the order parameter for a quantum many - body system can be systematically derived even without the knowledge of symmetry in the system .",
    "we expect that our scheme can shed new lights on the controversies in some frustrated antiferromagnet@xcite and bond - order wave in the extended hubbard model@xcite .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the system size being simulated was 14 sites .",
    "remarkably , we see that even for such a small system size , the spectra of the single - site or two - site reduced density matrices were able to capture the information of the nature of the order in the ground state of the system .",
    "this may be a promising scheme as one could have insight on the order existing in the system without simulating a large system , which requires intensive computational powers .",
    "however , we would like to mention that the crossing of the dominating states in the reduced density matrix spectrum may not locate the phase boundaries exactly . to locate the phase boundaries",
    ", one can use the order operator derived to calculate the correlation function and then perform finite size scaling analysis .",
