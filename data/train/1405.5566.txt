    "in the mid 1980 s bourgain extended birkhoff s pointwise ergodic theorem , proving that for any dynamical system @xmath4 on a @xmath5-finite measure space @xmath6 with an invertible measure preserving transformation @xmath7 the averages along the squares @xmath8 converge @xmath9-almost everywhere on @xmath6 for all @xmath10 with @xmath11 , ( see @xcite ) . not long afterwards in @xcite , the squares were replaced by an arbitrary integer - valued polynomial .",
    "the restriction to the range @xmath11 in bourgain s theorem turned out to be essential .",
    "recently , buczolich and mauldin @xcite have shown that the pointwise convergence of @xmath12 fails on @xmath13 ( see also @xcite ) .    in this article",
    "we are concerned with @xmath14 estimates for discrete higher dimensional analogues of the averaging operator and applications of such estimates to pointwise ergodic theorems .",
    "let @xmath15 be a @xmath5-finite measure space with a family of invertible , commuting and measure preserving transformations @xmath16 for some @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 denote a polynomial mapping such that each @xmath19 is an integer - valued polynomial on @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",

    "classical proofs of pointwise convergence require @xmath14 bounds for maximal function , reducing the problem to proving pointwise convergence for a dense class of @xmath14 functions .",
    "however , establishing pointwise convergence on a dense class may be a difficult problem .",
    "for instance bourgain s celebrated averaging operator along the squares is such an example .",
    "one of the possibilities , introduced by bourgain in @xcite , for overcoming this problem is to control the @xmath28-variational seminorm @xmath0 of a sequence of measurable functions @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 indeed , if @xmath31 for some finite @xmath32 then the sequence @xmath33 converges .",
    "theorem [ thm:3 ] , in particular , will follow from more general result .",
    "namely .",

    "setting we consider the averages @xmath41 for any finitely supported function @xmath42 .",
    "we will be mainly interested in @xmath43 bounds for @xmath28-variations of the averages @xmath44 . in this setup theorem [ thm:3 ]",
    "can be reformulated in the following way .",
    "[ thm:2 ] let @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath36 such that for every @xmath45 @xmath46 moreover , the constant @xmath38 is independent of the coefficients of the polynomial mapping @xmath39 .",
    "theorem [ thm:2 ] is the main result of this article and generalizes recent one dimensional variational estimates of krause @xcite .",
    "however , its proof will strongly explore maximal theorem for @xmath44 .",
    "namely , theorem [ thm:1 ] which is the higher dimensional counterpart of bourgain s theorem @xcite .",
    "[ thm:1 ] for each @xmath47 $ ] there is a constant @xmath48 such that for every @xmath45 @xmath49 moreover , the constant @xmath50 is independent of the coefficients of the polynomial mapping @xmath39 .",
    "bourgain s papers @xcite initiated extensive study both in pointwise ergodic theory along various arithmetic subsets of the integers ( see e.g. @xcite ) and investigations of discrete analogues of classical operators with arithmetic features ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "variational inequalities in harmonic analysis and ergodic theory have been the subject of many recent articles , see especially @xcite and the references given there ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we were motivated to study pointwise convergence of the averaging operators defined in by recent results of ionescu , magyar , stein and wainger @xcite .",
    "they considered pointwise convergence of some noncommutative variants of averaging operators along the polynomials of degree at most @xmath51 . the desire to better understand",
    "the restriction imposed on the degree of polynomials in @xcite , has led to , in particular , theorem [ thm:2 ] and theorem [ thm:1 ] from this paper .",
    "furthermore , the recent paper of krause @xcite inspired us to study variational estimates in higher dimensions  see theorem [ thm:2 ]  which in turn provide an approach to pointwise convergence different to the argument from @xcite . specifically , in this paper we relax the restriction on the degree of polynomials and we obtain all the results ( maximal and variational estimates and pointwise convergence ) for polynomials of arbitrary degree at the expense of the loss of the noncommutative setup which was the subject of @xcite .    the purpose of this article , compared with the prior works , is threefold .",
    "firstly , as we said before , we shall relax the restriction for the degree of the polynomials from @xcite .",
    "secondly , we provide variational estimates and thirdly , we will establish bounds in the inequalities and which are uniform in the coefficients of underlying polynomial mapping .",
    "the last statement finds applications in the discrete multi - parameter theories of maximal functions and singular integral operators .    the inequality from turned out to be decisive in one parameter theory , for instance in the ongoing project concerning @xmath43 estimates for the maximal function corresponding with truncations of radon transform from @xcite .",
    "namely , we have recently established , for some @xmath11 , the following inequality @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a truncated radon transform along the polynomial mapping @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a caldern - zygmund kernel on @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in fact , in the proof of inequality we had to replace the supremum over the set of integers @xmath59 with the supremum over the set of dyadic numbers @xmath60 . since the operators @xmath61 are not positive we had to be more careful , but for @xmath62 we have the pointwise estimate @xmath63 for some @xmath64 .    the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] will be based on an idea of ionescu and wainger from @xcite where they established @xmath43 bounds for the discrete radon transform by partitioning the operator into two parts , the first part controllable in @xmath43 and the second part controllable in @xmath65 . more precisely , for every @xmath66 $ ] and @xmath67 we are going to find an operator @xmath68 such that @xmath69 and for each @xmath24 @xmath70 then with the aid of these two estimates one can use restricted interpolation techniques as in @xcite and conclude that holds .",
    "the same idea was also explored in @xcite .",
    "here we are going to make use of this argument and provide a different approach to the estimates in @xmath65 and @xmath43 as compared both to bourgain s paper @xcite and ionescu , magyar , stein and wainger s paper @xcite . since the @xmath28-variational seminorm controls the supremum norm for any @xmath32 we only need @xmath28-variational estimates on @xmath65 . the @xmath65 theory for averaging operators along polynomials in @xcite",
    "was built , to a large extent , on the circle method of hardy and littlewood and on the `` logarithmic '' lemma due to bourgain ( see @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "assume that @xmath71 and for @xmath72 define the neighbourhoods @xmath73 then there exists a constant @xmath64 such that @xmath74 for every @xmath75 .",
    "although bourgain s lemma is interesting in its own right , and is a powerful tool in discrete problems , it has also found wide application in problems susceptible to time - frequency analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , nazarov , oberlin and thiele @xcite introduced a multi - frequency caldern - zygmund decomposition and extended bourgain s estimates to provide @xmath1 bounds and variational estimates ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some refinement of the results from @xcite established by krause @xcite turned out to be an invaluable tool in variational estimates for bourgain s averages along polynomials in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose another approach which avoids the use of bourgain s lemma or its counterparts .",
    "our approach to theorem [ thm:1 ] and theorem [ thm:2 ] proceeds in several stages .",
    "we begin with a particular lifting of the operator .",
    "this procedure will permit us to replace any polynomial mapping @xmath39 by a new polynomial mapping ( the canonical polynomial mapping : see lemma [ lem:1 ] in section [ sec2 ] ) which has all coefficients equal to @xmath76 .",
    "this will result in the uniform estimates and will reduce the study to the canonical polynomial mapping . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we construct suitable approximating multipliers : see the definitions of , and , and prove strong @xmath65 bounds on their @xmath28-variations . these multipliers will be useful in proving theorem [ thm:1 ] and theorem [ thm:2 ] for @xmath77 in section [ sec4 ] and section [ sec5 ] , respectively .",
    "the proofs of these @xmath65 bounds , on the one hand , will be covered by the multi - dimensional variant of the circle method of hardy and littlewood .    on the other hand",
    ", we will make use of some elementary inequalities for @xmath28-variations from section [ sec2 ] , which have not been used in this context .",
    "this is the novelty of the paper and allows us to study the approximating multipliers by a direct analysis which avoids using results like bourgain s lemma .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we also provide the @xmath43 theory , @xmath11 , necessary to obtain theorem [ thm:1 ] .",
    "the strategy of the proof of @xmath43 bounds will be very simple .",
    "we shall compare the discrete norm @xmath78 of our approximating multipliers with the continuous norm @xmath79 of certain multipliers which are a priori bounded on @xmath1 .",
    "but this will only give good bounds when @xmath80 is restricted to the large cubes depending on @xmath81 as in the ionescu ",
    "wainger partition .",
    "the small cubes will be covered by a restricted @xmath43 bound with logarithmic loss for the operator : see theorem [ th:5 ] .",
    "this idea was pioneered by bourgain in @xcite to prove the full range of @xmath43 estimates . here",
    "we will explore this idea , giving a slightly simpler proof of this fact .",
    "all these results will allow us to decompose the operator @xmath82 into two parts @xmath83 and @xmath84 as was described above and will establish theorem [ thm:1 ] : see section [ sec4 ] . finally ,",
    "having proved theorem [ thm:1 ] for all @xmath85 and theorem [ thm:2 ] for @xmath77 and @xmath86 we shall employ the interpolation argument from krause s paper @xcite and conclude that theorem [ thm:2 ] holds for all @xmath2 and @xmath3 .      throughout the whole article ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will write @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) if there is an absolute constant @xmath64 such that @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) . moreover , @xmath91 will stand for a large positive constant whose value may vary from occurrence to occurrence .",
