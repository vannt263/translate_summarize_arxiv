    "spatial discreteness and nonlinearity have been probed recently within the context of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in optical lattices  @xcite and propagation of light in nonlinear optical waveguide arrays  @xcite , to name a few .",

    "localization is due to nonlinearity induced frequency shifts , which tune a localized excitation out of resonance with the surrounding nonexcited extended lattice modes , and is also known as _",
    "selftrapping_.    the normal modes ( nms ) of a one - dimensional _ linear _ chain with uncorrelated random potential are spatially localized ( anderson localization ) .",
    "therefore any wavepacket , which is initially localized , remains localized for all time @xcite .",
    "anderson localization is harvesting on destructive interference and phase coherence , despite the fact , that the frequency of a localized nm is not tuned out of resonance with other nms . from the experimental point of view , disorder can be easily implemented in bec s by tuning the wavelength of laser beams  @xcite or by superimposing a speckle pattern  @xcite .",
    "recently experiments have been reported , which observe anderson localization for noninteracting becs @xcite . in optics ,",
    "disorder can be implemented in waveguide arrays by altering the fabrication process @xcite or , in optically induced lattices , by adding a speckle beam @xcite .",
    "nonlinearity induces interaction between nms , and frequency shifts .",
    "while interaction favours delocalization @xcite , frequency shifts may lead to selftrapping and again to localization @xcite .",
    "continuation of nms into the nonlinear regime may keep localization , but also delocalize excitations via resonances @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of the combined action of nonlinearity and disorder are possible both in bec systems , as well as in optics @xcite .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , any initial wavepacket and a fixed value of the nonlinearity parameter define three regimes - weak , intermediate and strong nonlinearity . the weak nonlinearity regime is characterized by anderson localization on potentially large time scales , and subsequent detrapping and spreading .",
    "the intermediate regime is yielding spreading from scratch .",
    "the spreading continues despite the fact that the nonlinear frequency shifts weaken , since that is balanced by the increase in the number of excited nms .",
    "finally the strong nonlinearity regime leads to partial selftrapping , i.e. a part of the wavepacket selftraps and does not delocalize while the remaining part spreads again .",
    "the spreading is universal and subdiffusive , therefore rather slow , posing challenges for experimental studies , where one has to compete with dissipation mechanisms which lead to dephasing .",
    "here we study the spreading of a wavepacket in a finite lattice by ramping the strength of nonlinearity in time .",
    "the increase of nonlinearity with time counteracts the above diminishing of nonlinear frequency shifts , and substantially speeds up the spreading process . at the same time",
    ", resonant adiabatic excitation of distant nms can contribute to a spreading as well .",
    "that makes our results also easier accessible for experiments .",

    "this can be implemented for the case of a bec , where the interaction between condensed atoms can be described by a single parameter , the scattering length , which is proportional to an external applied magnetic field .",
    "this parameter can be adjusted via feshbach resonances and therefore the nonlinear interaction between particles can be tuned and controlled in time  @xcite . in optical systems ,",

    "is reduced to the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath17 .",

    "the asymptotic spatial decay of an eigenvector is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the localization length  @xcite . the nm participation number @xmath37 characterizes the spatial extend - localization volume - of the nm .",
    "it is distributed around the mean value @xmath38 with variance @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the average spacing of eigenvalues of nms within the range of a localization volume is therefore @xmath40 .",
    "the linear case is characterized by two frequency scales : the width of the spectrum @xmath41 , and the average spacing @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , since we will operate with finite systems , we also have two spatial scales - the localization length @xmath43 and the system size @xmath44 .",
    "we launch a single site excitation in the center of our system with @xmath45 , and follow its evolution until @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . for @xmath48 , the fastest plane waves will reach the boundaries exactly at @xmath49 . a plot of the corresponding norm profile is shown in fig.[linear](a ) .",
    "the corresponding participation number is @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , an almost completely spread wavepacket is characterized by roughly @xmath51 , since a strictly homogeneous distribution is counterbalanced by dynamical fluctuations , and therefore , on average , every second site is not excited .",
    "now we increase the strength of disorder @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath52 the localization length equals the system size .",
    "therefore , for @xmath53 [ fig.[linear](b ) ] we still observe almost full spreading , although the fronts propagate slower . for @xmath54 [ fig.[linear](c ) ] we observe anderson localization - the wavepacket is confined to the localization volume which is of the order of 20 sites .",
    "we performed runs for 100 realizations , and compute the average of the second moment @xmath55 and of the participation number @xmath56 at @xmath57 ( see fig.[linear_pm2 ] ) .",
    "the second moment @xmath55 decreases with increasing disorder as expected , showing that waves propagate slower even within the localization volume ( @xmath58 ) due to disorder induced backscattering .",
    "however , the participation number @xmath56 shows a slight increase for weak disorder , with a subsequent ( expected ) decrease for stronger disorder . for the ordered case @xmath48 the chosen initial condition excites one half of all available nms .",
    "that follows from the reflection invariance of the lattice around the center , where the initial wavepacket is placed .",
    "all nms separate into two irreducible groups of even and odd ones , or symmetric and antisymmetric ones with respect to reflections around the chain center .",
    "a single site excitation in the center excites only even nms . for weak disorder",
    "all nms start to become excited .",
    "therefore the part of the volume which is occupied by the wavepacket at some later time , is filled more homogeneously .",
    "note that the effect is weak - the participation number increases by @xmath59 .",
    "that may be due to the fact , that at the same time the wavepacket spreads less effectively , as it follows from the results on the second moment .",
    "the equations of motion in normal mode space read @xmath60 with the overlap integral @xmath61 the variables @xmath62 determine the complex time - dependent amplitudes of the nms .",
    "nonlinearity therefore induces interaction between nms .",
    "in particular the nonlinearity renormalizes frequencies .",
    "if frequencies are shifted out of the spectrum of the linear equation , selftrapping occurs , and excitations stay localized for long , may be infinite , times .",
    "we are not aware of a straightforward and unique way to calculate such a frequency shift for a given distribution @xmath63",
    ". therefore we will look for suitable estimates .",
    "one possibility is to neglect the coupling along the lattice , and treat lattice sites as independent .",
    "then the nonlinear frequency shift at site @xmath4 is @xmath64 .",
    "another possibility is to derive an effective frequency @xmath65 for a given state .",
    "we treat a state as a stationary one @xmath66 .",
    "we insert this ansatz in ( [ eq ] ) , multiply this equation by @xmath67 and sum over all lattice sites : @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{l}\\ ] ] at any time @xmath5 the effective frequency @xmath69 $ ] . in practice",
    "both definitions from above are giving similar results , and we will mainly use ( [ l ] ) .",
    "in all our simulations we use a single - site excitation as the initial condition : @xmath70 with @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 . to effectively harvest on resonances with the spectrum",
    "we have imposed that @xmath74 . with that , and for @xmath75 , the effective frequency will decrease starting from @xmath76 until it reaches the bottom of the spectrum @xmath77 where we stop our simulations .",
    "the bottom of the spectrum of an infinite system is located at @xmath78 .",
    "however , for finite systems the bottom of the spectrum @xmath79 depends on the given realization . from ( [ l ] ) we see that a positive increment in @xmath15 will decrease the effective frequency of the system . therefore , the state will be able to resonate with other nms inside the spectrum .",
    "outside of it , the solution transforms into a selftrapped localized state similar to a discrete soliton  @xcite , which is a time - periodic and exponentially localized excitation  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ ao3 ]",
    "we show the evolution of an initial single site excitation for @xmath54 and @xmath45 , when @xmath80 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the excitation remains trapped due to anderson localization , and does not reach the boundaries of the finite chain [ see fig .  [ linear_pm2](c ) ] .",
    "however , for @xmath81 , a slow increase of nonlinearity leads to a complete delocalization of the wavepacket at @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , the effective frequency @xmath83 decreases and around that time reaches the bottom of the spectrum . at the same time",
    ", the participation number reaches its saturation value @xmath84 . for a larger ramping velocity @xmath85 , but exactly the same disorder realization , the wavepacket does not spread over the entire chain . at a much shorter time",
    "@xmath86 the effective frequency touches the bottom of the spectrum , the participation number saturates around @xmath87 , and the state becomes selftrapped , still occupying only 20 out of 100 sites .",
    "further increase of the ramping velocity will make the final wavepacket more and more localized .    in order to study the dependence of the delocalization process on the disorder strength , we define our simulation scheme as follows : ( i ) we ramp the nonlinearity for a given velocity @xmath88 ; ( ii ) we stop the simulation when @xmath65 reaches the bottom of the spectrum @xmath77 , indicating a stop of spreading due to selftrapping ; ( iii ) we compute @xmath56 and if @xmath89 we decrease the velocity @xmath88 until @xmath90 , which corresponds to a fully delocalized wavepacket .",
    "therefore we obtain the critical velocity @xmath91 for a given disorder realization . for @xmath92 the wavepacket does not spread over the entire chain , while for @xmath93 it does .",
    "we repeat the scheme for 100 different disorder realizations and obtain an average value for @xmath94 .",
    "finally we change the disorder strength @xmath12 and obtain the dependence @xmath95 .",
    "results are shown in fig.[data ] .",
    "we observe two different regimes . for strong disorder",
    "@xmath96 the localization length is smaller than the system size @xmath45 .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath94 is monotonously decreasing with increasing disorder strength .",
    "this can be expected , since the stronger the disorder , the more localized the nms are , and the less is the number of other nms a given nm can interact with due to nonlinearity .",
    "therefore we need slower ramping in order to give ample time to nms to interact . for weak disorder",
    "@xmath97 the localization length is larger than the system size @xmath45 .",
    "therefore all nms are essentially extended over the entire chain . in this regime",
    ", we observe that the critical velocity @xmath94 increases with increasing disorder strength .",
    "this effect may be due to the fact , that in the limit of zero disorder @xmath48 , the nonlinearity induces a selective interaction between nms , as mentioned above ( for details of that selective interaction , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "weak but nonozero disorder removes the selection rules , and leads to an interaction of all modes with each other , thereby increasing the number of available modes ( channels ) by a factor of two .",
    "the nonlinearity induced spreading is more effective .",
    "in particular it can redistribute the energy into two times more modes .",
    "the hallmark of the transition from weak to strong disorder is the maximum in the dependence of @xmath95 at @xmath52 .",
    "the maximum is located at @xmath98 . in particular ,",
    "for @xmath99 it is located at @xmath100 and for @xmath101 at @xmath102 . for large",
    "@xmath103 the maximum position is therefore shifted closer to @xmath48 , and the value in the maximum increases .",
    "the value of @xmath94 at @xmath48 can be estimated by noting that the fastest plane waves reach the edges of the chain at a time @xmath104 .",
    "the time it takes to shift the frequency of the initially excited oscillator out of the band is @xmath105 . equating @xmath106 we estimate @xmath107 .",
    "the increase of this critical speed in the presence of weak disorder is due to the above discussed increase of modes ( channels ) available .",
    "this increase by a factor of two leads to a decrease of the norm in each mode also by a factor of two , and , consequently , implying a larger critical velocity . therefore @xmath108 and @xmath109 at best .",
    "this increase by a factor of two is close to the numerical observation ( see fig.[data ] ) .",
    "let us discuss possible mechanisms of wavepacket spreading in the regime of strong disorder , when @xmath80 .",
    "the packet spreading beyond the localization volume is entirely due to the nonlinearity , which induces interactions between nms .",
    "assume the wavepacket has a certain size at some time @xmath5 . further spreading implies excitation of exterior nms .",
    "since the interaction between nms falls off exponentially for distances larger than @xmath43 , the relevant exterior nms to be excited will be located in a nonexcited ( cold ) boundary layer outside the wavepacket , with a width roughly of the order of the localization volume .",
    "a given cold exterior nm can be excited coherently or incoherently .",
    "a coherent excitation implies a resonance with an excited nm from the wavepacket , and a corresponding resonant transfer of energy ( as it happens during the beating of energy between two weakly coupled harmonic oscillators ) .",
    "an incoherent excitation implies the absence of such resonances , and an almost random fluctuation of the nms phases inside the wavepacket .",
    "it generates a random force which incoherently excites ( heats ) the exterior nms .",
    "such a spreading corresponds to a diffusive spreading of the wavepacket , therefore of the norm , and the energy .",
    "the spreading of wavepackets in the presence of a constant nonzero nonlinearity strength @xmath110 was studied in several papers @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was observed , that a spreading wavepacket is characterized by a growth of its second moment @xmath111 .",
    "the exponent @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "a theoretical analysis showed , that this subdiffusive spreading is not due to resonant excitation of exterior modes , but due to incoherent heating .",
    "the origin of the chaotic dynamics of the wavepacket itself comes from resonant interaction of nm pairs inside the packet .",
    "the statistical analysis of the probabilities of such internal resonances leads to the conclusion , that the second moment obeys the following equation : @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the average norm density inside the wavepacket , and @xmath115 an unknown function , which however , as numerical studies suggest , decreases with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "since the packet size is @xmath116 , it follows that the participation number @xmath117 and the second moment @xmath118 . as a consequence , @xmath119 .",
    "the exponent @xmath120 and is in very good agreement with the numerical studies .",
    "the nonlinearity induced frequency shift inside the packet @xmath121 .",
    "the more the packet spreads , the smaller the frequency shifts are .",
    "this weakening is counterbalanced by the increase in the size of the packet , so that more modes are involved , and guarantee a slow but steady subdiffusive spreading .",
    "assuming , that in the present case the spreading is incoherent as well , we find with @xmath122 : @xmath123 the nonlinearity induced frequency shift @xmath124 in the present numerical studies @xmath8 , and we find @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . at variance with the case of constant nonlinearity ( which yields subdiffusion with @xmath128 ) we obtain superdiffusion with @xmath129 .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the increasing nonlinearity counterbalances the decay of the frequency shifts , and enhances the interaction of the nms from the wavepacket with cold exterior nms .",
    "the growth of the frequency shifts will finally lead to a selftrapped state , as observed in the numerical studies .",
    "let us estimate the dependence of the participation number @xmath56 of the selftrapped wavepacket on @xmath88 . with eq.([dif2 ] ) it follows @xmath130 therefore the nonlinear frequency shift @xmath131 .",
    "when this frequency shift reaches some finite ( disorder dependent ) value at @xmath132 , the wavepacket selftraps .",
    "therefore @xmath133 .",
    "finally @xmath134 for @xmath8 we find that the selftrapped wavepacket has size @xmath135 . increasing the ramping speed @xmath88 therefore leads to a smaller extend of the selftrapped wavepacket , as observed in the numerical results . we can not estimate the measured dependence @xmath95 , since we do not know the function @xmath115 from ( [ dif1 ] )",
    "let us assume that the wavepacket spreads by resonantly exciting exterior nms . except for exponentially small ramping velocities",
    ", the relevant exterior nms will be located in a layer of the width of the localization volume .",
    "the average frequency spacing @xmath136 separates possible frequencies of resonant interactions , which can take place due to the nonlinearity induced frequency shift .",
    "therefore the number of possible resonances is limited to the number of nms within one localization volume , i.e. to the localization volume @xmath137 itself .",
    "the maximum size , to which a wavepacket can grow , is then proportional to the @xmath138 .",
    "the numerical results in fig.[data ] show , that for strong disorder @xmath139 the critical velocities are of the order of @xmath140 .",
    "for such a velocity the wavepacket spreads completely over a chain with 100 sites .",
    "the maximum localization length @xmath141 , therefore the localization volume is less than @xmath142 , and the maximum size to less than @xmath143 , which indicates , that resonant spreading is not the dominant mechanism .",
    "let us assume the optimum case scenario for resonant spreading .",
    "that implies , that at a given time a resonance at the edge of the wavepacket can take place , and the energy is transfered much faster , than it takes to shift the frequency to the next resonance .",
    "assume we start with one nm excited , with its frequency located at the edge of the spectrum . for @xmath8 , we will hit the next possible resonance after time @xmath144 .",
    "we assume , that a resonant mode is available in the localization volume , and is immediately excited .",
    "the norm is now equally distributed between both nms , each of them having norm @xmath145 .",
    "nonlinearity is further ramped up , but in order to shift the frequency to the next resonance , a larger time @xmath146 is needed , and so on . as long",
    "as the wavepacket does not selftrap , we find @xmath147 .",
    "therefore the total time to reach the @xmath148-th resonance scales as @xmath149 , the participation number @xmath150 grows as @xmath151 and the second moment @xmath152 .",
    "since that idealized process is already slower than the incoherent spreading due to diffusion , we expect that resonant spreading is weakly contributing to the numerically observed spreading .",
    "we have investigated the spreading of a wavepacket in a disordered nonlinear chain , when ramping the nonlinearity in time . for linear ramping @xmath8",
    "we find that the spreading is mostly due to incoherent diffusive processes .",
    "for an infinite chain , the nonlinear frequency shift always leads to a selftrapping of the wavepacket , and therefore not to a complete delocalization .",
    "the second moment @xmath125 is predicted to grow superdiffusively , at variance to the previously studied case of constant nonzero nonlinearity , which yields subdiffusion .",
    "therefore the present case is easier accessible in experiments , due to possible restrictions on maximum propagation times .",
    "experiments are done with finite systems .",
    "we studied the case of a finite chain , and computed the critical ramping speed @xmath91 , which separates selftrapped localized from selftrapped delocalized states at the end of the ramping process .",
    "we find that @xmath91 grows with increasing strength of disorder when the localization length is larger than the system size .",
    "that increase is due to the fact , that disorder is removing selection rules for the interaction of normal modes , present in the case of zero disorder . for strong disorder",
    ", i.e. when the localization length becomes smaller than the system size , the critical velocity drops with further increase of the disorder strength . that is due to the fact , that the normal modes are less and less spread ,",
    "interact with fewer other modes , and the nonlinearity induced frequency shift is more efficient in tuning the wavepacket faster into a selftrapped state .",
