    "the dielectric permittivities of graphite along the imaginary frequency axis were found by the use of tabulated optical data for the complex refractive index . in doing so different sets of data were analyzed and necessary extrapolations to high and low frequencies were done .",

    "notice that the developed formalism is not applicable to single- or twowall nanotubes where the atomic structure of the wall should be taken into account . in this case",
    "the van der waals force can be computed in the framework of density functional theory @xcite .",
    "finally , we have compared the free energies of the van der waals interaction between a hydrogen atom and multiwall carbon nanotube for the cases when atom is located outside or inside of the nanotube .",
    "it was shown that atoms situated inside of a multiwall nanotube possess lower free energy in a wide region of nanotube thicknesses , i.e. , such a position is energetically preferable .",
