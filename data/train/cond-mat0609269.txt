    "in the past years , there has been increasing theoretical interest in the quantum ferrimagnetic systems since the experimental realization of bimetallic quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) magnets @xcite .",
    "pioneering experiments on synthesizing the bimetallic chain compounds with each unit cell containing two spins were carried out successfully by kahn et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "typical compounds include two families of ferrimagnetic chains described by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2=1,3-propylenebis(oxamato ) , @xmath3=2-hydroxo-1,3-propylenebis(oxamato ) and a = ni , fe , co , and mn @xcite .",
    "these materials are quasi-1d bimetallic molecular magnets containing two different transition - metal ions per unit cell alternatingly distributed on a chain .",
    "most of these materials are described by heisenberg mixed - spin models with antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this has stimulated theoretical studies on the mixed - spin systems .",
    "a number of recent studies have been focused on ground - state properties of mixed - spin chain@xcite and ladders@xcite composed of two kinds of spins with half - integer and integer spins alternatively .",
    "it is well - known that a half - integer antiferromagnetic spin chain has gapless excitation spectrum and the integer ones show the haldane gap in their low energy spectrum , however the 1d ferrimagnets behave differently and exhibit intriguing quantum spin phases and thermodynamic properties .",
    "one of the intriguing features of the mixed - spin chain is that the ground state has a long - range ferrimagnetic order .     and @xmath4 respectively .",
    ", width=326 ]    while the physics of the mixed - spin chain is well understood , the spin ladders are still under intensive investigation since they exhibit rich phase diagrams .",
    "so far , a large class of mixed - spin two - leg ladders are investigated , but most of studies concern the physics of unfrustrated mixed - spin ladders . for the unfrustrated bipartite ladder with alternating half - integer and integer spins on neighboring sites",
    ", the ground state is shown to exhibit long - range order @xcite .",
    "in general , for the uniform spin ladders , frustration reduces the antiferromagnetic correlations and may produce various exotic quantum ground states such as the dimerized state@xcite . in comparison with the uniform systems ,",
    "less attention is paid to the role of frustration in the mixed spin systems and it is quite interesting to explore how the ferrimagnetic order is affected by the frustration @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of magnetic frustrations due to diagonal exchange bonds in a mixed - spin ladder was studied by using the approach of exact numerical diagonalization @xcite for a special case with equal strengthes of the rung coupling and diagonal couplings .",
    "it was shown that the long - range ferrimagnetic state may be destroyed and a singlet state appears at a large value of the frustration parameter . however , it is not clear how the diagonal frustrations compete with the exchanges along the legs and whether an exotic intermediate phase exists for arbitrary rung coupling .",
    "furthermore , an analytical analysis which works in both regimes with weak and strong frustrations is still lack .",
    "the general analytical method based on the spin wave theory is not capable to deal with the regime with strong frustration where the long - range order is destroyed . in order to provide a general understanding to frustration effect in the ferrimagnetic ladder system , in this work",
    "we carry out analytical investigation on the extended antiferromagnetic mixed - spin ladders in the limit of strong rung couplings . when the rung coupling is dominated , it is convenient and natural to map the original model onto an effective spin-1/2 exchange model .",
    "based on the effective model , we show that the ground - state properties for both the frustrated and non - frustrated ladders can be understood within the same framework and the phase transition from a ferrimagnetic state to a critical spin - liquid state is also discussed . in our theory , we treat the weak and strong frustrations on same footing . for generality",
    ", we consider the most general frustrated ladder model with arbitrary strengthes of exchanges of spins along the two legs as well as the diagonal exchanges .",
    "our model can interpolate between a variety of systems , exhibiting remarkably rich ground state behavior with both ordered and disordered phases .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the extended frustrated mixed - spin ladder is made of two types of spins with magnitude @xmath5 and @xmath6 located on the rungs of the ladder .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian of the mixed - spin ladder takes the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the number of rungs , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the spin-@xmath15 and spin-1 operators respectively . for the antiferromagnetic ladder , all the coupling parameters @xmath16 .",
    "the intrachain couplings along the up and down legs are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the interchain coupling across the rungs is @xmath19 and the diagonal exchanges between the rungs are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the summation is over the length of the chains and the periodic boundary is assumed .",
    "for such a ladder model , the frustration comes from the competition between the intrachain couplings ( @xmath17 and @xmath22 and the diagonal couplings ( @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "the model of ( [ hladder ] ) covers a variety of known models .",
    "the model with @xmath24 corresponds to a bipartite mixed - spin ladder model whereas the one with @xmath25 is equivalent to the railroad ladder model ; for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , our model reduces to the ladder model investigated in ref.@xcite , where only the case with @xmath28 was considered ; for @xmath26 and @xmath29=0 , the model is the dimerized zigzag mixed - spin ladder@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the strong coupling limit with @xmath30 @xmath21 . in this limit",
    ", the interactions between the neighboring rungs can be treated as perturbations of the system of uncoupled rungs .",
    "it is instructive to start by considering the two - site problem on an isolated rung with the hamiltonian given by @xmath31 eigenstates of the local hamiltonian on a rung can be classified according to the value of the total rung spin @xmath32 .",
    "the two spins with magnitude @xmath33 and @xmath6 can combine into @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to get the eigenenergy @xmath36 @xmath19 and @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are @xmath38 , \\\\ \\left|",

    "it is obvious that the ground state of a rung is a doublet and the excited state is a quartet with an excitation energy gap @xmath41 therefore in the strong rung - coupling limit spins on each rung of the ladder favor forming a doublet . since each rung can be either in the doubly degenerate state @xmath42 or @xmath43 the ground state of the zero - order hamiltonian @xmath44 is @xmath45foldly degenerate .",
    "when we go beyond the two - site problem , we need consider the inter - rung couplings . in general",
    ", the inter - rung exchanges will lift the degeneracy of the zero - order ground state and leads to an effective hamiltonian acting on the groundstate hilbert space of @xmath44 .",
    "we then derive the effective hamiltonian of the original ladder model in the truncated hilbert space composed of product of rung doublets by using perturbation method .",
    "similar schemes have been applied to study uniform spin ladders in the strong - coupling limit@xcite . to the first order and up to a constant of @xmath46 , the effective hamiltonian can be represented as @xmath47 where @xmath48 are four - foldly degenerate .",
    "it is convenient to introduce pseudo - spin-@xmath15 operators @xmath49 which act on the states @xmath50 and @xmath51 and are defined as @xmath52 with the above notation , we can identify the following relations @xmath53 therefore we can rewrite terms of @xmath54 in terms of the pseudo - spin operators .",
    "for example , we have @xmath55 for @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 and the corresponding coefficient is given by @xmath59 after some algebras , we can rewrite the effective hamiltonian ( [ eff1 ] ) as the following form @xmath60 \\label{heff}\\ ] ] with the effective parameter given by @xmath61    next we carry out calculation of the second order perturbation which is expected to give correction to the effective coupling parameter and the ground energy . in the first order calculation , the higher excited states ( quartets ) on the isolated rungs do not play role .",
    "however , such rung quartets give contribution to the higher order correction .",
    "the second order correction can be described by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the intermediate states with at least one quartet residing in the neighboring @xmath65",
    "th and @xmath66th rungs . therefore @xmath67 if @xmath68 @xmath69 or @xmath70 and @xmath71 if @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 after tedious but straightforward calculation , we can represent @xmath75 in terms of the pseudo - spin operators @xmath76 , \\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 the second order correction can also produce a term due to the three - site process which is described by @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath64 are the intermediate states with a quartet residing in the @xmath66th rung . in terms of the pseudo - spin operators , the hamiltonian @xmath81 is finally simplified to @xmath82 with @xmath83    therefore , up to the second order , the effective hamiltonian of the original ladder can be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) describes a spin-@xmath15 heisenberg chain with additional next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) exchanges .",
    "it is convenient to determine the phase diagram of the original ladder model from the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) since it has a much simpler form and was widely studied .",
    "since the terms with nnn exchanges come from the second - order perturbation , in general we always have@xmath87 .",
    "a small nnn ferromagnetic interaction is an irrelevant perturbation to the spin chain model@xcite .",
    "therefore we may approximate to determine the phase diagram by omitting the term of @xmath88 the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) with @xmath89 describes either a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath15 heisenberg chain depending on the sign of the effective parameter . based on the effective hamiltonian ,",
    "one is ready to get the ground energy of the mixed - spin ladder ( [ hladder ] ) in the strong coupling limit : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the ground energy per site of an isotropic spin-@xmath92 heisenberg chain and @xmath93 is the energy correction due to the nnn exchanges which reads @xmath94 with @xmath95 representing the ground state of heisenberg chain . from the corresponding results of the well - known heisenberg chain@xcite , we have @xmath96 when the system is in the ferromagnetic state , it is ready to obtain @xmath97 when the system is in the antiferromagnetic phase , no an analytical result is available .    from eq.([jeff ] ) , we see that the diagonal exchanges tend to produce an effective ferromagnetic coupling whereas the exchanges along the legs lead to an effective antiferromagnetic coupling . both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath15 heisenberg chains are exactly solved by the bethe - ansatz method@xcite , but they have very different ground - state properties .",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state consists of all spins parallel and thus has long - range order , whereas the antiferromagnetic ground state is a spin singlet which can be described by the critical spin - liquid phase . if @xmath98 the effective model is a ferromagnetic chain which exhibits gapless excitations and ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "equivalently , within the first order approximation the original mixed - spin ladder has ferrimagnetic ground state if @xmath99 on the other hand , the effective model is an antiferromagnetic chain if @xmath100 .",
    "correspondingly , the ground state of the original mixed - spin ladder is a critical spin liquid if @xmath101 .     and @xmath102 in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the solid line is the phase boundary determined by @xmath103 whereas the separated dots denoted by stars are obtained from the exact diagonalization of the spin ladder model.,width=326 ]    as we have mentioned that our mixed - spin ladder model includes a series of models as its special cases , we may understand the ground - state properties of these models by using our derived effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) . when @xmath104 our model reduces to a bipartite mixed - spin ladder model .",
    "the effective model ( [ h_eff ] ) is a ferromagnetic heisenberg chain because we have @xmath105 therefore we can conclude that the total spin of the ground state is @xmath106 when @xmath107 we get the railroad ladder model composed of coupled spin-@xmath15 and spin-@xmath108 chains .",
    "it is ready to conclude that its ground state is a singlet because the effective model ( [ h_eff ] ) is an antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with @xmath109 for the frustrated spin ladder with @xmath26 and @xmath110 , it is easy to see from the effective model ( [ h_eff ] ) that there exists a quantum phase transition arising from the competition of @xmath17 and @xmath111 the transition point is determined by @xmath103 with @xmath112 from the solution of the above equation , we can get the phase diagram of the mixed spin ladder as shown in fig.2 . above the phase",
    "boundary the original ladder is in a ferrimagnetic phase corresponding to @xmath113 , whereas the system is in an antiferromagnetic phase with @xmath100 below the phase boundary .    in order to check",
    "how good is our theory based on the perturbation method and the validation of the phase boundary determined by @xmath103 , we study the original spin ladder model by exact diagonalization method and determine its phase diagram numerically .",
    "the phase boundary determined by the effective spin chain model is not sensitive to the size of the system ( actually the phase boundary is completely independent of the size when we omit the term of nnn interaction ) .",
    "therefore for the purpose of verification of our analytical result , it is enough for us to consider a @xmath114-size ladder which can be diagonalized by the exact diagonalization method .",
    "the phase boundary can be determined simply by the ground state degeneracy of the system . in comparison with phase boundary obtained by omitting the term of the nnn exchanges ,",
    "we find that they agree very well in the strong coupling limit and as expected , the analytical result begins to deviate the exact numerical result when @xmath115 increases .",
    "finally , we address a special point with @xmath116 where the total spin on a rung is a good quantum number . from eq.([jeff ] ) , it is obvious that the model is effectively described by an antiferromagnetic spin chain with an effective coupling constant of @xmath17 and the high - order corrections vanish due to @xmath117 . actually this is an exact conclusion for this special case .",
    "this is clear if we rewrite the original hamiltonian as @xmath118 , \\ ] ] where @xmath119 with @xmath34 or @xmath35 and @xmath120 is defined as @xmath121 @xmath122 denoting the total spin on the @xmath65th rung . in the strong coupling limit @xmath123 , @xmath19 forces @xmath124 to take the value of @xmath15 and thus the ground - state properties of @xmath125 is described by an effective spin-@xmath15 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain . from eqs.([jeff2 ] ) and ( [ c ] ) , we see that @xmath126 when @xmath127 .",
    "this implies that the higher order correction also conforms to the exact result in this special case .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the ground - state properties of a generalized mixed - spin ladder with diagonal exchanges in the limit of strong rung couplings . by mapping it to an effective spin-@xmath15 heisenberg chain with additional nnn exchanges , we find that the diagonal exchanges lead to the ferromagnetic effective coupling whereas the exchanges along the legs produces the antiferromagnetic effective coupling .",
    "the ground state of the effective hamiltonian is either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the competition between these two opposite processes . with the help of the effective hamiltonian and omitting the additional small nnn exchanges",
    ", it is straightforward to analytically determine the transition point from the ferrimagnetic phase to the critical spin liquid phase .",
    "the phase boundary is found to agree with the result obtained by exact numerical diagonaliztion of the original spin ladder model .",
    "our results show that the strong coupling approach provides a simple and unifying way to exhibit the rich physics of the mixed - spin ladders .",
