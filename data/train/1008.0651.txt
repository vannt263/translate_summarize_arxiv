    "the importance of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) as cosmological distance indicators has been demonstrated over the last twelve years @xcite .",

    "the geometries of sne ia have been probed using different techniques . at early times ,",

    "nebular phase spectroscopy of sne  ia in the optical and infrared ( ir ) , when the ejecta are optically thin and the spectra are dominated by the fe - group elements , can be used to reveal the structure at the centre of the explosion ; albeit projected onto the radial velocity direction @xcite .",
    "the almost - unblended fe line at 1.6 @xmath9 shows peculiar line profiles such as flat topped profiles indicating material with central cavities , and @xcite observed identical profiles and features in mid - ir lines .",
    "this strongly supports that the line asymmetries are kinematic in nature and all but exclude explanations due to uncertainties in the atomic physics , which may lead to an underestimation of blends , or optical thickness effects .",
    "@xcite linked the asymmetries of the central layers with expansion velocities less than @xmath10 @xmath11with the outer layers .",
    "they found that the peak of the nebular emission line profiles , in the optical , exhibited blue or red shifts , consistent with an asymmetric distribution along the line of sight .",
    "it was found that this kinematical offset was related to the evolution of the velocity of the absorption minimum of the @xmath12 feature ( parametrized by the temporal velocity gradient @xmath2 ) at early times ; suggesting both are signatures of the departure of sne  ia from simple spherical symmetry .",
    "probing the inner structure and correlations with outer layers is central to answering key questions of supernova theory ( for a review see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite observed a relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath4 , and interpreted it as indicating a single asymmetric geometry for type ia  sne .",
    "this asymmetry gives rise to the apparent diversity amongst this sn class due to the different orientations at which individual sne are observed . in also considering polarimetric observations , we find a good linear correlation between @xmath1 , an established indicator of geometry , and @xmath28 , implying the latter is a signature of the geometry .",
    "the observed tight correlation between these two parameters for normal sne  ia implies that the asymmetries probed by @xmath1 are unlikely to be due to a random , clumpy line forming region , rather it indicates the role of a large scale asymmetry in the ejecta .",
    "we find that @xmath1 shows a weak correlation with the later nebular velocity , that may indicate a possible correlation between the asymmetries inferred for the layers observed at early and late times .",
    "this correlation is expected to be weak , however , as @xmath1 and @xmath4 probe orthogonal projections of the geometry .",
    "this suggests that in trying to understand the influences of geometry on measurable photometric and spectroscopic parameters , such as @xmath47 , it is preferable to use the early time indicators @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite suggested the difference between hvg and lvg sne  ia arises from the orientation at which the ejecta are viewed .",
    "they hypothesised that sne  ia will be observed as hvg sne if the ejecta approaching the observer were mixed with heavy elements , increasing the opacity and keeping the photosphere at high velocities at early times . in their model ,",
    "lvg sne  ia are observed from other angles , dominated by intermediate mass elements ( imes ) , through which the photosphere has already receded even at early times .",
    "a key consequence of this model is asymmetric excitation of the ejecta leading to an asymmetric photosphere , in particular for hvg sne .",
    "this is in contrast to the low limits placed on the departure of the photospheres of sne  ia from spherical symmetry from polarimetry of these events ( @xmath48 ; ) .",
    "it is significant that , amongst other line features , is generally observed to be polarized in sne  ia , whereas the continuum is not .",
    "this requires that the line forming region be asymmetrically distributed across a spherical photosphere @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite and @xcite interpret the velocity of @xmath12 as the photospheric velocity , which depends on the degree of mixing of fe - group elements and the opacity in the outer layers of the ejecta .",
    "@xcite find , however , that the `` w '' feature at @xmath49 , which shows lower velocities and a less severe velocity gradient than , more accurately reflects the true photospheric velocity .",
    "@xcite observed that the velocity determined for is lower than that determined from @xmath12 for all sne types , and that the difference is largest for the hvg sne .",
    "this implies @xmath12 is formed above the photosphere , and is not specifically coupled with the photospheric velocity .",
    "the velocity evolution of is dependent on the mass contained in the line forming region above the photosphere ( deposited by the protrusions of imes into the outer layers ) .",
    "conversely to the correlation of @xcite , an increase in opacity due to fe - group elements mixed into the outer ejecta layers would slow the apparent recession of the photosphere leading to an lvg rather than hvg sn .    for sn  2004dt ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed negligible polarization associated with the @xmath50 , which @xcite interpreted as a spherical distribution of unburned oxygen evenly covering the photodisk . that both and occupied the same velocity space , but had very different polarization properties , suggested that portions of the oxygen layer were mixed with imes ( such as si ) with an asymmetric distribution @xcite .",
    "the combination of low polarization for oxygen and the continuum , but with polarized silicon has been observed for other sne  ia of both lvg and hvg classes such as sne 2001el , 2006x and 2009dc .",
    "the uniformity of oxygen in the outer ejecta of sne ia is further demonstrated by @xcite , who find almost constant line strength for the absorption of @xmath51 for both lvg and hvg sne at b light - curve maximum .    based on their correlation ,",
    "@xcite suggest that instabilities of both the central and outer layers are caused during the deflagration phase and due to rising plumes .",
    "the geometry , and in particular the physics of the runaway and the location of the deflagration to detonation transition , may be affected by other processes such as the progenitor s rotation and its binary companion @xcite . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "significant heavy elements from the deflagration are mixed into the outer layers , on the side of the ejecta from which an hvg sn  ia is observed .",
    "the polarization of , and the inferred asymmetries , and the correlation with @xmath2 suggest a single offset , with hvg sne  ia being those with an offset si distribution mixed into the outer o layer in the direction of the observer and the products of deflagration receding . at significant angles away from the offset direction ,",
    "the si is found in a thinner layer , more evenly excited by the underlying ni substrate , leading to an lvg sn  ia with a lower polarization for @xmath12 and in which products of deflagration appear to approach the observer .",

    "the majority of the @xmath53 is produced during the detonation phase .",
    "the fact that line polarization is observed to be strongest in normal sne  ia and small in subluminous sne  ia argues against deflagration instabilities as the origin of the observed correlations .",
    "as polarization probes asymmetries in the plane of the sky and nebular phase velocities probe asymmetries perpendicular to the plane of the sky , the combination of both these measures provides the opportunity to overcome projection effects and completely probe the three - dimensional structure of these events . by bringing together the measurements of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath34 ,",
