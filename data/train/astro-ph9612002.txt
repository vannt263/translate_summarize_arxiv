    "in the unified model for seyfert galaxies ( antonucci 1993 and references therein ) , type 2 sources are believed to be intrinsically identical to type 1 s , but observed at inclination angles , with respect to the symmetry axis of the molecular torus ( see e.g. ward 1994 ) , greater than the torus half  opening angle .",
    "therefore , at least in optical / uv , the nucleus of seyfert 2 galaxies is not directly visible .    in x ",
    "rays the situation is more complex . in this band ,",
    "the two most important interactions between photons and ( cold ) matter are photoabsorption and compton scattering .",
    "the photoabsorption cross section strongly depends on energy ( decreasing approximately as @xmath0 ) , while the compton cross section is constant , at least up to the klein ",
    "nishina decline .",
    "the two cross sections , for solar chemical composition , are equal at about 10 kev .",
    "if the column density of the torus is smaller than @xmath1 @xmath2 , the nucleus turns out to be visible above a few kev , and the sources are named _ compton  thin _ , because the matter is optically thin to compton scattering .",
    "if , on the contrary , the column density exceeds that value , the matter is optically thick to compton scattering ; for compton optical depths of @xmath3a few , the nucleus becomes practically invisible also in hard x ",
    "rays because , after a few scatterings , photons are redshifted down to the photoabsorption dominated regime . these sources are called _ compton ",
    "thick _ seyfert 2 galaxies , and can be observed in x ",
    "rays only in scattered light , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "of course , they are very faint in x  rays and only a handful ( four , excluding",
    "the borderline source ngc 4945 ) of them are presently known .",
    "even if the type-1 nucleus is , in compton  thick sources , completely obscured in the whole x  ray band , its existence is revealed by scattered light .",
    "two scattering media are thought to be present in the vicinity of the nucleus : @xmath4 the optically thin matter responsible for the scattering and polarization of the optical broad lines in several seyfert 2 s ( the so  called  warm mirror \" ) , and @xmath5 the inner surface of the torus itself which , in these sources , is optically thick by definition .",
    "@xmath4 scattering from the warm mirror of the nuclear continuum radiation produces a spectrum which is practically identical to the nuclear spectrum up to energies at which compton recoil is important , where a cut  off occurs ( matt 1996 ; poutanen et al .",
    "therefore , its shape is expected to be , at least below say a few tens of kev , a power law with photon index @xmath32 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "line emission from ionized atoms is also expected , iron k@xmath6 lines being among the most prominent ( other lines , e.g. from carbon , oxygen and neon , can also be very intense ; however , they are often diluted by other continua arising in soft x  rays , e.g. from starburst regions .",
    "fe xxv ( 6.7 kev ) and fe xxvi ( 6.97 kev ) k@xmath6 line emission from such a medium is discussed in detail by matt , brandt & fabian ( 1996 ) .",
    "their equivalent width with respect to the continuum reflected from the warm mirror itself can be as high as a few kev .",
    "@xmath5 as shown by ghisellini , haardt & matt ( 1994 ) and krolik , madau & ycki ( 1994 ) , the spectrum of the nuclear radiation scattered from the inner surface of the torus is similar to that observed in many seyfert 1 galaxies ( mushotzky , done & pounds 1993 and references therein ) , where the reflecting matter is believed to be the inner accretion disc .",
    "it is usually referred to as the compton reflection component .",
    "it is very flat in the classical 210 kev band ( photon index less than 1 ) due to the increasing ratio of compton scattering to photoabsorption cross sections ( e.g. lightman & white 1988 ) . a fluorescent k@xmath6 line at 6.4 kev from neutral iron , with an equivalent width with respect to the continuum reflected by the same matter of about 12 kev ( e.g. matt et al . 1991 ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ; reynolds et al .",
    "1994 ) is also expected , as well as fainter lines from lighter elements ( reynolds et al .",
    "1994 ; matt , fabian & reynolds 1996 ) .",
    "the intensity of the radiation from the warm mirror depends mainly on the optical depth of the mirror itself , while that of the torus component depends basically on the inclination angle of the system ( see matt , brandt & fabian 1996 ) .",
    "their relative ratio can therefore be very different from source to source .",
    "three cases are then possible :    \\i ) the warm mirror component dominates over the torus component .",
    "a 210 kev spectrum composed by a power law with photon index about 2 plus strong ionized lines is expected .",
    "no sources of this kind have been discovered yet to our knowledge .",
    "\\ii ) the two components are of the same order .",
    "a spectrum with an intermediate or flat photon index ( 11.5 or less ) and both neutral and ionized lines is expected , and it has indeed been observed in ngc  1068 ( ueno et al .",
    "1994 ; see below for a revised analysis ) and ngc  6240 ( iwasawa , private communication ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that it is possible to observe in one and the same source a continuum dominated , above a few kev , by the torus component _ and _ also a complex iron line , as the lines from ionized matter can be very bright and then visible even if the relative continuum is much smaller than the torus one ( this actually seems to be the case for the two sources of this group ) .",
    "\\iii ) the torus component dominates over the warm mirror component .",
    "a very flat ( less than one ) spectrum with a strong 6.4 kev iron line is expected , and actually observed in ngc  6552 ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1994 ) and in the circinus galaxy ( matt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in the next section we will briefly discuss each of the four currently known compton  thick sources .",
    "* ngc  1068 * is surely the best studied among compton  thick seyfert 2 s ( and maybe among all seyfert 2 s ) . its x ",
    "ray spectrum is composed by thermal  like emission , probably due to a starburst region ( wilson et al .",
    "1994 ) and dominating below 34 kev , and a hard power law with superposed a complex iron line , composed by a neutral component at 6.4 kev and contributions from he and h  like iron ( ueno et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) .",
    "iwasawa , fabian & matt ( 1996 ) have recently re  analysed the asca pv observation and found that : a ) the photon power law index is smaller than previously estimated , being less than 0.4 .",
    "this value is consistent with a pure reflection continuum .",
    "b ) a feature just redwards of the neutral iron line is present , with a flux of about 10 percent of that of the line , and interpreted as the line compton shoulder , i.e. line photons scattered once before escaping from the matter .",
    "this feature is predicted by the reflection models ( see e.g. matt , perola & piro 1991 ) but never detected so far .",
    "c ) the ionized iron lines are both redshifted ; the derived velocity of the emitting matter is about 40005000 km / s .",
    "the interpretation of the spectrum above a few kev is that we are looking at reflection from both the warm mirror and the obscuring torus , with the former component smaller but not completely overwhelmed by the latter one , so that the continuum is dominated by the torus reflection but the lines from the ionized matter ( possibly forming a wind , as suggested by its relatively high velocity ) are still visible .",
    "* ngc  6240 * is one of the most famous merging system and a prototype ultraluminous infrared galaxy . in x ",
    "rays , the source has been observed by both rosat  pspc ( fricke & papaderos 1996 ) and asca ( k. iwasawa , private communication ) .",
    "the rosat  pspc revealed extended soft x ",
    "ray emission , which can be explained by a starburst model .",
    "the asca spectrum is complex , consisting of : a thermal  like component , consistent with the rosat observation and dominating in soft x ",
    "rays ; a quite hard power law ; both neutral and ionized iron lines .",
    "the hard spectrum is very similar to that of ngc  1068 , and can be explained in the same way .",
    "* ngc 6552 * was serendipitously observed by asca ( mainly thanks to the very prominent 6.4 kev iron line ; fukuzawa et al .",
    "1994 ) , and then identified with a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "its x  ray spectrum is well described by a pure compton reflection continuum ( reynolds et al .",
    "1994 ) , and then interpreted as reflection from cold matter ( possibly the torus ) of an otherwise invisible x  ray nucleus .",
    "a heavily absorbed power law maybe also be present , but the source is too faint to permit any strong conclusion on this and other spectral details .",
    "the * circinus galaxy * is a nearby ( 4 mpc ) seyfert 2 with a very prominent ionization cone , strong coronal lines and water maser emission ( see oliva et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) . before asca",
    ", it was never observed in x ",
    "rays , apart from a detection in the rosat all sky survey .",
    "the asca spectrum is quite remarkable , showing a very prominent iron k@xmath6 line at 6.4 kev , many other lines from lighter elements as well as the k@xmath7 iron line , and a very hard continuum ( matt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "below about 2 kev , a further component emerges , possibly due to a starburst region . above that energy , the spectrum",
    "is well described by a pure reflection component .",
    "lines from elements lighter than iron are also expected in this model ( reynolds et al . 1994 ; matt , fabian & reynolds 1996 ) .",
    "however , their observed intensities and centroid energy are not entirely consistent with reflection by cold matter ; improved asca  sis calibration matrices have to be waited for before further addressing this issue .",
    "the model described in sec.2 for the x  ray spectrum of compton  thick seyfert 2 galaxies is fully consistent with the observations of the four known sources of this class .",
    "a prediction of this model is a spectral cut ",
    "off at a few tens of kev due to compton recoil .",
    "bepposax and rxte observations will then be valuable in testing the model ."
