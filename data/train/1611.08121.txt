    "we report on our result on the one loop @xmath0 impact factor , a first step toward a complete next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) description of many inclusive or exclusive diffractive processes , either in the linear bfkl  @xcite or the non - linear color glass condensate ( cgc ) approaches  @xcite .",
    "diffraction can be theoretically described either using a _ resolved _ pomeron contribution , or using a _",
    "direct _ pomeron contribution involving the coupling of a pomeron with the diffractive state .",
    "our results are based on the latter .",
    "we show in particular that our result for the real contributions to the leading order ( lo ) @xmath1 impact factor and to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath0 impact factor allows one to extract the finite part of the nlo impact factor for diffractive dijet production .",
    "our calculation relies on balitsky s qcd shockwave formalism  @xcite .",

    "we use the lightcone gauge @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the sum of the external field @xmath14 and the quantum field @xmath15@xmath16 where @xmath17 is a profile function and the form for @xmath14 is valid in the small @xmath18 limit considered here . from the wilson lines , we define the dipole operator and its fourier transforms as follows : @xmath19 to get a physical amplitude , one should act with these operators on the incoming and outgoing states of the target . for a diffractive @xmath20 process",
    ", the following matrix elements will be involved : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an operator built from the wilson lines . in our case , there are two possibilities for @xmath22 : either a dipole operator @xmath23 , or a double - dipole operator or in the mean field approximation , the matrix elements for the double dipole operators can be written as the product of the matrix elements for two dipole operators . ] @xmath24 .",
    "we will write @xmath25 rather than @xmath22 for readability .",
    "at leading order , the evaluation of the diagram contributing to the impact factor for the @xmath27 transition is straightforward . after the projection on the color singlet state and the subtraction of the contribution without interaction with the external field",
    ", the contribution of this diagram can be written in the momentum space as the following convolution of wilson line operators with the impact factor : @xmath28 where we denoted @xmath29 , and where @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) is the momentum of the outgoing quark ( resp .",
    "antiquark ) .",
    "the virtual corrections to the @xmath32 transition involve two kinds of contributions .",
    "examples of diagrams contributing to these virtual corrections are shown in figure  [ fig : virtual ] .",
    "the convolution is similar to the leading order result , but it involves more wilson line operators : @xmath33 \\nonumber \\right . + \\ , n_c \\left .",
    "\\left ( \\widetilde{\\mathbf{u}_{13}\\mathbf{u}_{32 } } + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{13 } + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{32 } - \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{12 } \\right ) \\phi_{v_2}^\\alpha\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is obtained were also obtained in @xcite . ] from diagrams of the type of the ones on the first line of figure  [ fig : virtual ] and @xmath35 is obtained from diagrams of the type of the ones on the second line of figure  [ fig : virtual ] .",
    "several divergences appear in each of the terms in equation  ( [ nloconv ] ) : @xmath36 contains soft , collinear , soft and collinear , and uv divergences , while @xmath37 contains a rapidity divergence . in the shockwave formalism and in lightcone",
    "gauge , one has to combine the cutoff prescription @xmath38 and the transverse dimensional regularization @xmath39 .",
    "the rapidity divergence in @xmath40 is canceled via the use of the b - jimwlk evolution equation for the dipole operator : evolving the dipole operator in the leading order convolution  ( [ loconv ] ) w.r.t .",
    "the longitudinal cutoff from the arbitrary @xmath7 to a more physical divide @xmath41 , which will serve as a factorization scale which separates the upper and lower impact factors , allows one to cancel the dependence on @xmath8 in @xmath40 and get a finite expression for the double - dipole contribution to the nlo impact factor . in momentum space and in @xmath42 dimensions ,",
    "the evolution equation is given by : @xmath43^{1-\\frac{d}{2}}}+\\frac{\\delta(\\vec{k}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{1})}{\\left[(\\vec{k}_{2}-\\vec{p}_{2})^{2}\\right]^{1-\\frac{d}{2}}}\\right)\\right].\\ , \\label{jimwlk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the divergences in @xmath44 must be canceled by combining such terms with the associated real corrections to form a physical cross section . the first step to compute such",
    "a cross section is to use a jet algorithm in order to cancel the soft and collinear divergence . by using the jet cone algorithm in the small cone limit , as used in  @xcite",
    ", we proved that such a cancellation occurs .",
    "the remaining divergence can be expressed by factorizing the leading order cross section : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is extracted from the divergent part of the virtual amplitude .",
    "this contribution must be combined with real corrections from the @xmath47 impact factor .",
    "the convolution for the @xmath48 impact factor is very similar to the one for the nlo @xmath26 impact factor : @xmath49 \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{12 } \\ , \\delta(\\vec{p}_3 )   + \\ , n_c   \\left ( \\widetilde{\\mathbf{u}_{13}\\mathbf{u}_{32 } } + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{13 } + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{32 } - \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_{12 } \\right ) \\phi_{r_2}^\\alpha \\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are obtained by computing respectively the two diagrams in which the emitted gluon does not cross ( resp .",
    "crosses ) the shockwave , as described in @xcite and @xcite .    when considering our exclusive cross section , the real contributions are those where the additional gluon is either collinear to the quark or to the antiquark , so that they form a single jet , or too soft to be detected _",
    "i.e. _ with an energy which is lower than a typical energy resolution @xmath52 .",
    "the contribution from the soft gluon to the dijet cross section can be written with a very simple form : @xmath53 where the integration is performed in the @xmath54-phase space region where @xmath55 .",
    "the collinear contribution also has a simple form , in terms of the jet variables .",
    "for example when the gluon is collinear to the quark one gets : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is proportional to the `` number of jets in the quark '' , a dglap - type emission kernel .    as shown in  @xcite , combining equations  ( [ virtualdiv ] ) , ( [ realsoft ] ) , ( [ realcol ] ) and the equivalent of equation  ( [ realcol ] ) where the gluon is collinear to the antiquark , one finally obtains a finite cross section .",
    "dijet production in ddis at hera was recently analyzed  @xcite , and a precise comparison of dijet versus triple - jet production , not performed yet at hera  @xcite , would be of much interest .",
    "investigations of the azimuthal distribution of dijets in diffractive photoproduction performed by zeus  @xcite show signs of a possible need for a 2-gluon exchange model , which is part of the shockwave mechanism .",
    "our calculation could be used for phenomenological studies of those experimental results .",
    "complementary studies could be performed at lhc with upc events .",
    "furthermore , our result could be extended to diffractive exclusive meson photo- and electroproduction .",
