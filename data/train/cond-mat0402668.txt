    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath8 @xcite has motivated extensive experimental and theoretical work , as this material has the highest critical temperature among superconducting binary compounds ( t@xmath13k ) .",
    "mgb@xmath8 is isostructural and isoelectronic with intercalated graphite , and has a simple alb@xmath8-type crystal structure ( space group @xmath14 ) consisting of alternating close - packed mg layers and graphite - like honeycomb b layers",
    ". most theoretical and experimental work on mgb@xmath8 has been devoted to the understanding of the mechanism responsible for its unusual superconductivity .",
    "by now it is widely accepted that mgb@xmath8 is a non - conventional bcs - type superconductor .",
    "first - principle calculations @xcite show that superconductivity resides in two groups of bands : ( i ) the two strongly superconducting @xmath12 bands and ( ii ) the two weakly superconducting @xmath15 bands . a large number of experiments , in particular studies with raman spectroscopy @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , muon spin resonance @xcite , point - contact spectroscopy @xcite and specific - heat @xcite measurements support the notion that mgb@xmath8 is a double gap superconductor . on the basis of this evidence",
    "new physics has been unveiled .",
    "for example , theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite works have shown that the anisotropy of the upper critical field @xmath16 differs substantially from the anisotropy of the london penetration depth @xmath17 , at low temperatures .",
    "it has been also suggested that mgb@xmath8 posseses a peculiar vortex structure @xcite , where vortices in the @xmath15 band are characterized by absence of localized states in the core , very large vortex core size , and strong core overlap .",
    "many of the efforts have been focused in the study of doped mgb@xmath8 by partially substituting mg or b sites with electron or hole dopants .",
    "such substituents modify ( i ) the crystal structure , and ( ii ) the electron density of states at the fermi level @xmath18 , and therefore are extremely important in analyzing the band structure and the microscopic nature of superconductivity in mgb@xmath8 . a systematic study of al@xmath19mg@xmath20b@xmath8 samples with mg replaced by al has already been undertaken by several groups .",
    "@xcite in particular , @xmath21al and @xmath0b nmr measurements in al@xmath19mg@xmath20b@xmath8 @xcite , provided strong evidence that the fermi surface is made of hole - type @xmath12-bonding @xmath22 cylindrical sheets , which fill up upon al doping and collapse at @xmath23 , together with hole - type and electron - type @xmath24 @xmath15-bonding tubular networks , in accordance with theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite these results suggest anisotropic pairing and multigap superconductivity for mgb@xmath8 .",
    "an alternative approach is to introduce dopants into the b sublattice .",
    "several groups have attempted to replace b with carbon . @xcite the results reported in the literature indicate that the degree of carbon doping depends on the procedure and the starting material used in the synthesis of mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 .",
    "similarily with al@xmath19mg@xmath20b@xmath8 , the replacement of boron with carbon leads again to doping with one electron , and a significant depression of @xmath10 @xcite , although the effect is more pronounced in the case of mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 . at the same time",
    ", x - ray measurements have shown that mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 exhibits a highly anisotropic lattice contraction with the lattice parameter @xmath25 decreasing almost linearly with increasing doping level @xcite , while the @xmath26 parameter is virtually unaffected by the doping level , indicating that carbon is exclusively substituted in the boron honeycomb layer without affecting the interlayer interactions .",
    "besides , data taken from tunneling @xcite , specific heat @xcite , point - contact @xcite , and muon sr measurements @xcite reveal that despite the homogeneous and random nature of c substitution the two - gap behavior is preserved in mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 .",
    "this is in contrast to theoretical predictions , according to which enhanced quasiparticle interband scattering should lead to an effective one - gap behavior in the doped samples @xcite and suggests that the interband scattering is selectively suppressed in mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite    in order to elucidate further the complicated electronic structure of mgb@xmath8 , we have performed a comparative @xmath0b nmr study on pure mgb@xmath8 and carbon doped mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 samples for @xmath27 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "our results indicate a considerable increase of @xmath9 and strong supression of both the coherence peak and the bcs temperature dependence of @xmath1 with carbon doping .",
    "these results are in agreement with recent ac - susceptibility and torque measurements @xcite , which show strong enhancement of @xmath9 , passage from the clean to the dirty limit regime , and shrinking of the @xmath12 band hole - type parts of the fermi surface with carbon doping .",
    "polycrystalline pure mgb@xmath8 and carbon doped mgb@xmath2c@xmath19 samples for @xmath28 and @xmath6 were prepared by reaction of mg , amorphous b and carbon black at @xmath29k for @xmath30 h , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite synchrotron x - ray diffraction patterns , raman and ac - susceptibility measurements of samples from the same batch are presented elsewere .",
    "@xcite @xmath0b nmr line shape measurements of the central transition ( @xmath31 ) were performed on a home - built spectrometer operating in external magnetic field @xmath32 koe .",
    "the spectra were obtained from the fourier transform of half of the echo , following a typical @xmath33 spin - echo pulse sequence .",
    "@xcite the irradiation frequency was the same in all experiments .",
    "the spectral bandwidth around the irradiation frequency was @xmath34 khz , which is enough to cover adequately the nmr signals at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath0b @xmath35 of the central line was determined by applying a saturation recovery technique , and fitting with the two exponential relaxation function that is appropriate for @xmath36 nuclei , @xmath37 .",
    "when a type - ii superconductor is placed into an external magnetic field @xmath38 , at temperatures lower than the temperature of the second critical field @xmath39 , the magnetic field penetrates partially in the form of thin filaments of flux , and generates a vortex lattice with a characteristic magnetic field distribution @xmath40 .",
    "this can be excellently monitored by using magnetic resonance techniques , like muon spectroscopy ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and nmr @xcite , as the resonance frequency is directly proportional to the local magnetic field .",
    "in case of an ideal hexagonal vortex lattice , a characteristic frequency distribution is formed with a peak corresponding to the saddle point of the magnetic field distribution , which is located midway between two vortices , and two steps at the maximum ( @xmath41 ) and minimum ( @xmath42 ) fields @xcite , corresponding to the vortex core and the center of a vortex triangle , respectively .",
    "this distribution depends on the two fundamental length scales of superconductivity : the magnetic penetration length @xmath43 ( the variance of the frequency distribution is inversely proportional to @xmath43 ) , and the coherence length @xmath44 , which defines the `` extension '' of a vortex .",
    "@xcite it is thus possible from the nmr line shapes to acquire information about the topology and dynamics of the vortex lattice , as well as parameters that reflect the symmetry of the superconducting pairing .",
    "b nmr line shapes as a function of temperature for pure mgb@xmath8 under a magnetic field @xmath45 koe . for clarity ,",
    "each spectrum is normalized to its maximum intensity.,width=321 ]    the @xmath0b nmr spectra of the investigated pure and carbon doped mgb@xmath8 powder samples , in a magnetic field of @xmath7 koe , are shown as a function of temperature in figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] . in the case of pure mgb@xmath8 , the line shapes in the normal state remain unchanged down to @xmath39 , while for @xmath46 a new peak develops at the low frequency side . in a recent work ,",
    "the direct comparison of the @xmath0b nmr line shapes with dc - magnetic susceptibility measurements has shown that the frequency position and the shape of the low frequency peak by decreasing temperature , follows the development of the vortex lattice .",
    "@xcite in view of this fact , the persistence of the normal state signal down to the lowest measured temperature @xmath47k , has been explained as manifestation of the high anisotropy in the upper critical field @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite considering that in pure mgb@xmath8 the anisotropy ratio is equal to @xmath49 at low temperatures @xcite , it is expected that in external magnetic field of @xmath7 koe ( @xmath50 tesla ) a part of the randomly oriented grains remains in the normal state ( unshifted peak ) , while the rest is in the vortex state .",
    "this gives rise to superposition of nmr signals from the vortex and the normal states .",
    "the above argument becomes obvious if we consider that the upper critical field in each crystallite varies with the angle between the external magnetic field and the @xmath51axis as , @xmath52 . according to this formula , only crystallites with @xmath53 would give the characteristic signal of a type - ii superconductor in the vortex state . if for a part of the grains , @xmath54 , then the nmr line shape would be the sum of spectra coming from crystallites in the normal and the vortex state .",
    "consequently , for @xmath55 , the nmr line shapes will reflect solely the magnetic field distribution of the pure vortex state , whereas for @xmath56 only the line shape of the normal state will be observed . at this point",
    "we must note that the polycrystaline samples show a lower @xmath9 , in comparison to single crystals , where @xmath57 koe has been observed .",
    "this fact may be explained as showing that polycrystalline samples are more clean than single crystals and therefore exhibit a higher @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite    b nmr line shapes of mgb@xmath59c@xmath60 as a function of temperature , under a magnetic field @xmath45 koe .",
    "for clarity , each spectrum is normalized to its maximum intensity.,width=321 ]    it is thus quite remarkable that in the carbon - doped systems the normal state signal component disappears below @xmath39 , as clearly observed in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . in particular , in the case of mgb@xmath59c@xmath60 , the line shape starts to broaden below @xmath61k , while shifting to lower frequencies .",
    "the disappearance of the normal state signal component indicates an enhancement ( in comparison with pure mgb@xmath8 ) of @xmath62 above @xmath7 koe , thus giving rise to the pure vortex state at low temperatures .",
    "however , in the case of mgb@xmath63c@xmath64 , line shapes in the mixed state appear to be quite more symmetric , and less shifted than the line shapes of the @xmath28 sample , which is a signature of the gradual deformation of the vortex lattice by increasing carbon doping .",
    "similar increase of @xmath9 and reduction of the anisotropy have been previously observed in the mixed superconducting state of lightly al - doped mgb@xmath8 samples .",
    "@xcite    b nmr line shapes of mgb@xmath63c@xmath64 as a function of temperature , under a magnetic field @xmath45 koe .",
    "for clarity , each spectrum is normalized to its maximum intensity.,width=321 ]    b nmr line width as a function of temperature for pure mgb@xmath8 ( filled circles are for the normal state and filled squares for the vortex state ) , mgb@xmath59c@xmath60 ( open stars ) , and mgb@xmath63c@xmath64 ( open circles ) .",
    "lines are theoretical @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 curves from ref .",
    "@xcite , after appropriate scaling for the following cases : ( i ) conventional bcs superconductivity , ( ii ) double gaped superconductivity with the magnetic field parallel to the c - axis ( in the dirty limit ) , or to the ab - plane ( in the clean limit ) , and ( iii ) double gaped superconductivity with the magnetic field parallel to the c - axis ( in the clean limit).,width=321 ]    the disappearance of the normal state signal in the carbon doped samples enables the exact calculation of the variance @xmath12 ( second moment ) of the frequency distribution in the vortex state as a function of temperature .",
    "this is important as the second moment of the nmr frequency distribution , is formally related to the magnetic penetration depth @xmath67 according to formula @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio for boron , and @xmath70 is the flux quantum ( @xmath71 ) @xcite .",
    "we note that in powder compounds with strong anisotropy one should take into consideration that @xmath12 contains contributions from both in - plane @xmath72 and perpendicular @xmath73 , which may vary differently with temperature .",
    "according to the ginzburg - landau theory , clean superconductors with arbitrary gap anisotropy are characterized by a single anisotropy parameter , i.e. @xmath74 . under this aspect",
    "one would expect that for mgb@xmath8 , @xmath75 .",
    "however , recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies have shown that due to the two gap character of superconductivity in mgb@xmath8 , @xmath76 is nearly isotropic ( @xmath77 ) at low temperatures , while it increases to @xmath78 at @xmath10 .",
    "it is thus expected that at low temperatures @xmath12 would reflect a mean @xmath79 .",
    "here , we would like to stress that there are certain factors which complicate the interpretation of @xmath12 in terms of the magnetic penetration depth : ( i ) as pointed out by brandt @xcite , various kinds of random distortions degrade significantly the magnetic field distribution in the vortex state and ( ii ) in pure mgb@xmath8 the high frequency tail of the line shapes overlaps with the normal state signal component , while in the carbon doped samples the tail is strongly supressed .",
    "the latter effect might be produced by the establishment of a disorder - driven bragg glass state , right below @xmath80 , which partially smooths out the details of the magnetic field distribution .",
    "@xcite these problems allow only a rough estimation of the penetration depth .",
    "for example , the slightly shorter second moment of pure mgb@xmath8 at low temperatures in comparison with the carbon doped mgb@xmath59c@xmath60 sample , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , may reflect the stronger pinning effect by the carbon dopant . @xcite despite the above mentioned shortcomings , we would like to point out some features , which appear to support the two - gap superconductivity scenario for mgb@xmath8 .",
    "first of all , we notice that by assuming a mean @xmath81 at low temperatures , we obtain @xmath82 mhz , which is not very far from the measured @xmath83 values for the three studied samples ( @xmath84 is @xmath85 for the normal state nmr signals ) , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "what is remarkable is that both carbon doped samples exhibit an almost linear temperature dependence of @xmath12 with a small hump at @xmath86 k , which follows relatively well the predicted temperature dependence for @xmath87 , as described in a recently proposed two - gap model @xcite .",
    "this may be considered as indication that two gap superconductivity is moderately affected at field @xmath7 koe , in agreement with recent point - contact spectroscopy data which show that at low temperatures the smaller @xmath15 gap survives up to fields @xmath88 koe @xcite . as can be seen in figure [ fig4 ]",
    ", there is relatively good coincidence between theory and experiment for two cases : ( a ) with the magnetic field along the @xmath26-axis in the dirty limit ( predicted @xmath89 ) , and ( b ) with the magnetic field along the @xmath90-axis in the clean limit ( predicted @xmath91 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the latter case can be excluded as it corresponds to order of magnitude broader vortex state nmr signals than those experimentally observed .",
    "on the basis of the above @xmath92 nmr line shape analysis , it may be concluded that carbon doping increases drastically the coherence length @xmath58 , while driving the systems from the clean to the dirty limit regime , in agreement with recent observations .",
    "@xcite      the temperature dependence of @xmath0b @xmath93 for the pure mgb@xmath8 and mgb@xmath63c@xmath64 samples is presented in figure [ fig5 ] . in the case of pure mgb@xmath8 for @xmath94k , @xmath35 was measured on the peak of the normal state signal , and for @xmath95k on two different spectral positions : ( i ) on the peak ( saddle point ) of the signal component from the vortex state , and ( ii ) on the peak of the signal component from the normal state , by applying the two exponential analysis described by kotegawa et al .",
    "@xcite    b nmr ( @xmath93 ) relaxation rates as a function of temperature for pure mgb@xmath8 and carbon doped mgb@xmath63c@xmath64.,width=321 ]    b nmr saturation recovery curves of pure mgb@xmath8 at @xmath96 , for measuring @xmath35 of the normal signal component ( uper panel ) and of the vortex signal component ( lower panel ) .",
    "the vortex state signal was nicely fitted with a single exponential analysis .",
    "fit of the normal signal component was only possible by considering a double @xmath97 and @xmath98 analysis , where @xmath98 was set equal to the @xmath35 value of the vortex state signal component ( the dot - line is the best single exponential fit).,width=321 ]    the biexponential nature of the nuclear magnetization recovery curves in this latter case is clearly demonstrated in figure [ fig6 ] , which exhibits @xmath0b nmr saturation recovery curves at @xmath47k for the normal state signal component ( upper panel ) and the vortex state signal component ( lower panel ) .",
    "while the saturation recovery curve from the vortex state signal can be fitted by considering a single @xmath99 s , in the case of the normal state signal component , a nice fit is only obtained by considering two relaxation times : a long one @xmath99 s , which follows the temperature dependence of @xmath35 in the vortex state , and a short one @xmath100 s. similar results have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite apparently , the short @xmath97 component belongs to the normal state nmr signal component from grains in the normal state , and will be neglected in the following .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath101 values below @xmath10 are enhanced over the korringa value of the normal phase , as also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a phenomenon which is not yet understood .",
    "the evolution of the relaxation rate @xmath93 as a function of temperature in the mixed superconducting state is shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is observed that above @xmath102k , @xmath103 is constant , with a value @xmath104 @xmath105 , following a korringa temperature dependence .",
    "right below @xmath10 , @xmath103 forms a peak centered at @xmath106k .",
    "this peak is obviously attributed to the coherence ( hebel - slichter ) peak @xcite and indicates a fully gaped s - wave pairing state .",
    "this effect has been recently demonstrated by kotegawa et al . in a @xmath92 nmr study of lightly doped mg@xmath20al@xmath19b@xmath8 samples .",
    "@xcite the solid curve in the inset of figure [ fig5 ] is the t dependence of @xmath1 , by using the typical @xmath107-wave model , where a phenomenological energy broadening function is assumed to be of a rectangle type with a width @xmath108 and a height @xmath109 as presented by hebel .",
    "@xcite by considering a superconducting gap size of @xmath110 and @xmath111 in agreement with kotegawa at al .",
    "@xcite , a nice fit is obtained down to @xmath112 k ; however , @xmath103 appears to saturate at lower temperatures .",
    "the origin of this effect is not quite clear .",
    "however , the opening of the second gap as possible origin of the deviation from the typical bcs behaviour is excluded as it does not gives the almost horizontal low temperature slope of the @xmath103 vs @xmath66 curve .",
    "deviation from the bcs behaviour at low temperatures has been already reported in both conventional isotropic @xcite and anisotropic type ii superconductors .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon has been attributed to contribution in the relaxation mechanism from the vortex dynamics @xcite , which becomes predominant at low temperatures , where the bcs contribution to the relaxation rates is very small . on the basis of this argumentation @xmath113 in the mixed superconducting state of mgb@xmath8",
    "is expected to be given by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the contribution from quasiparticle scattering and the vortex motion respectively .",
    "considering the vortex fluctuations , we have @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the larmor frequency and @xmath119 is the fluctuating field in the perpendicular direction . in the case of ( @xmath120 and by considering that @xmath121 , the above formula becomes @xmath122 , and @xmath93 shows at low temperatures the linear @xmath66-dependence as in figure [ fig5 ] .    at the same time",
    ", even a small ammount of carbon doping like @xmath123 leads to significant suppression of both the coherence peak and of the rapid fall of @xmath1 below @xmath10 , as observed in the lower pannel of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "first of all we would like to notice that the opening of the superconducting gap suppresses @xmath93 , while the sudden increase of @xmath18 at @xmath10 acts in the reverse way ( @xmath124 ) , so the coherence peak in @xmath1 may be considered as the result of the competition between these two factors . hence , any change in the gap strength or @xmath18 , would affect directly the coherence peak and the slope of the @xmath1 vs @xmath66 curve below @xmath10 .",
    "it is also notable that ( i ) according to the literature non - magnetic inpurity- like carbon - scattering smears out the gap anisotropy and enhances the coherence peak @xcite , and ( ii ) the two - gap behaviour is retained upon light carbon doping .",
    "@xcite it is thus straightforward to conclude that the supression of the coherence peak is not caused by impurity scattering , but is rather consequence of the shrinking of the @xmath12 hole bands with carbon , i.e. electron doping .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that even a small substitution of boron with carbon in mgb@xmath8 leads to substantial increase of @xmath9 and unveils the magnetic field distribution in the vortex state , as reflected in the @xmath92 nmr frequency distribution .",
    "the temperature dependence of the second moment of the nmr signal @xmath12 vs. @xmath66 shows a clear deviation from the bcs theory of the penetration depth @xmath43 and correlates nicely with a two gap model for @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath9 enhancement indicates drastic reduction of @xmath58 and passage from the clean to the dirty limit with light carbon doping . according to the spin - lattice relaxation measurements , in pure mgb@xmath8 a strong coherence peak",
    "is observed close to @xmath10 , followed by rapid decrease in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath66 plot , which is indicative of the s - type nature of superconductivity . in carbon - doped systems , both effects faint out , presumably because of gradual electron filling and shrinking of the @xmath12 hole - type cylindrical fermi surfaces .",
