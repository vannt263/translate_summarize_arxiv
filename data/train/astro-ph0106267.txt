    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) , despite sometimes being labeled `` failed stars '' , are very interesting objects . according to our current understanding , bds may represent the extreme low - mass end of star formation in which the mass is too small to sustain thermonuclear fusion .",
    "this stellar - substellar transition ( also defined as the minimum mass at which the internal energy provided by nuclear burning quickly balances the gravitational contraction energy ) is expected to occur around 0.075@xmath9 ( baraffe et al@xmath10 1998 ) for objects with solar metallicities .",
    "this value is slightly lower in recent models , which predict a transition mass of 0.072@xmath9 ( chabrier & baraffe 2000 ) .",
    "objects with masses below this limit never reach the stable hydrogen burning main sequence , but instead cool down as they age ( burrows et al@xmath10 1997 ; chabrier et al@xmath10 2000 ) so that their surface temperatures and luminosities strongly depend on age as well as mass .",
    "as these cooling curves rely on poorly tested theoretical models , it is highly desirable to calibrate them with direct measurements .",
    "obtaining dynamical masses for very low - mass ( vlm , @xmath11 ) stars and bds from binaries is a challenging prospect , as so far there are no known eclipsing binary vlm stars or bds .",
    "however , there are a number of known wide , non - eclipsing vlm and bd binaries ( kirkpatrick et al@xmath10 2001 ; gizis , kirkpatrick & wilson 2001 ; leinert et al@xmath10 2001 ; see also reid et al@xmath10 2001a and references therein ) that have been observed with a range of instruments and techniques , including ground - based infrared and optical imaging , speckle interferometry , adaptive optics ( ao ) , and the hubble space telescope .",
    "these binary systems promise to yield highly accurate dynamical masses , although they tend to have long periods and hence will require patience .    in the absence of direct mass measurements for vlm / bd objects ,",
    "one has to rely on indirect methods that may constrain mass ranges but that do not provide high - precision mass values .",
    "one very useful such technique is the lithium test ( magazz , martn & rebolo 1993 ) .",
    "lithium is an element that is easily destroyed under the conditions prevalent in stellar interiors at temperatures slightly below those required for hydrogen burning .",
    "objects more massive than @xmath12 have their primordial lithium abundances depleted as long as they are fully convective . the lithium test has been used to confirm bd candidates in the pleiades ( e.g. , basri , marcy & graham 1996 ) and in the field ( e.g. , martn , basri & zapatero osorio 1999 ; kirkpatrick et al@xmath10 1999 ; tinney , delfosse & forveille 1997 ) .",
    "gl569a is a nearby ( @xmath13=9.8pc ) , chromospherically active late - type ( m2.5v ) star .",
    "forrest , skrutskie & shure ( 1988 ) first reported a possible bd companion with a separation of 5  from the primary .",
    "based on a low resolution spectrum henry & kirkpatrick ( 1990 ) classified this object as an m8.5 dwarf with a mass of @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , martn et al@xmath10 ( 2000a ) resolved the companion into two separate objects ( gl569ba and bb ) using ao observations with the keckii telescope .",
    "they estimated the orbital period of the ba - bb binary to be around 3 years , and the total mass of the binary pair to be in the range @xmath15 .",
    "herein we present the results of extensive follow - up observations of this interesting pair , including improved photometry as well as near - ir spectroscopy and astrometry of the resolved binary components .",
    "we use the photometry to accurately place the objects in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , the spectroscopy to derive spectral types , and the astrometry to derive the total mass of the system from its orbital parameters .",
    "broad - band near - infrared photometry of the composite pair gl569bab is available in the literature ( forrest et al@xmath10 1988 ; becklin & zuckerman 1988 ) .",
    "however , the measurement uncertainties claimed by the authors are too large for an accurate placement of these objects in the hr diagram or for direct comparison with theoretical evolutionary models . with the objective of improving the photometric data , we have collected @xmath7 and @xmath16 direct images of the system gl569a and gl569bab with the near - infrared camera ( hgcdte detector , 256@xmath17256 elements ) mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 1.5-m carlos snchez telescope ( cst , teide observatory ) on 2001 february 8 .",
    "the observations were performed through the `` narrow - optics '' of the instrument , which provides a pixel projection of 0.4  onto the sky .",
    "the atmospheric seeing conditions during the night of the observations were fairly stable around 1 , which allowed us to easily separate the m2.5-type star from the pair gl569bab .",
    "this latter object was not resolved into its two components .",
    "the total integration times were 5s and 40s in @xmath7 and @xmath16 filters , respectively .",
    "a five - position dither pattern was used to obtain the images ; each image consisted of 4 ( @xmath7 ) or 8 ( @xmath8 ) co - added exposures of 0.25s ( @xmath7 ) and 0.5s ( @xmath8 ) respectively .",
    "the dither pattern was repeated twice for the k - band observations .",
    "dithered images were combined in order to obtain the sky background , which was later substracted from each single frame .",
    "gl569bab is clearly detected in individual images , and we have obtained aperture photometry on each of them using phot in iraf .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were placed on the ukirt photometric system using observations of the standard star hd136754 ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) , which was imaged with the same instrumental configuration just before and immediately after our target . both the science target and the standard star were observed at similar air masses .",
    "the photometric error of the calibration was @xmath180.03mag in both filters .",
    "@xmath16 displays a different bandpass compared to @xmath19 ; the transformation between these two filters is not well defined yet , albeit for objects as red as gl569bab it has been estimated at @xmath16@xmath19=0.035 ( hodgkin et al@xmath10 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "we have applied this correction to our photometry as well as the relations given in leggett , allard & hauschildt ( 1998 ) to convert ukirt data into the cit photometric system .",
    "the final average magnitudes derived for gl569bab are given in table  [ phot ] , where the photometric errors listed correspond to typical 1@xmath4 uncertainties of single measurements .",
    "the astrometry of gl569bab relative to the bright primary gl569a as measured on the cst data ( mjd=51948.202 ) is the following : angular separation of 4.890@xmath180.040 , and position angle of 30@xmath20@xmath183@xmath20 .",
    "we note that these values differ from those published in forrest et al@xmath10 ( 1988 ) by more than 2@xmath4 , providing evidence of the orbital motion of gl569bab around the m2.5-type star in the time interval of roughly 15years .",
    "gl569bab was observed on 7 occasions between 1999 august and 2001 may with the keck ii ao system ( wizinowich et al@xmath10 1988 ) .",
    "the first 3 observations made use of the kcam camera with a nicmos-3 infrared array .",
    "the later observations made use of the slit - viewing camera ( scam ) associated with the nirspec instrument ( mclean et al@xmath10 1998 ) .",
    "scam uses a picnic hgcdte array . for both cameras the pixel scale was 0.0175  and the field of view was @xmath21 , except for the 2001 may observation when",
    "the scam pixel scale was changed to 0.0168 .",
    "exposures were generally obtained in the @xmath22-band , except for 2000 febuary when the observations were taken in the @xmath7-band .",
    "exact exposure times varied , but typically consisted of 30 coadded 2-second exposures . we used a 1%  transmission neutral density filter in the beam to prevent saturating the bright primary star .",
    "flat - field correction was performed using twilight exposures , while sky subtraction made use of images of an adjacent field observed immediately after gl569b .",
    "corrected seeing varied between 0.05  and 0.08 . for three of the observations the primary star ( gl569a ) was also in the field of view , providing an in - field astrometric reference . for the other observations the primary was either not observed or was saturated .",
    "no photometric standard stars were observed in any of the epochs , so we can not provide absolute photometric calibrations for the ao observations .",
    "figure  [ astro ] shows the resulting images of the pair gl569bab at six different epochs .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that this system is resolved into a binary and that orbital motion is evident .",
    "we used the daophot package ( in iraf ) for data reduction and analysis .",
    "the point spread function of the objects in each frame were fitted with an elliptical gaussian function , providing relative astrometry ( table [ ast ] ) and photometry .",
    "the relative photometry of gl569ba and gl569bb was derived by computing the ratio of the amplitudes of the best fitting gaussians ( table [ phot ] ) .",
    "gl569bb is fainter by 0.51@xmath180.02mag and 0.41@xmath180.03mag in the @xmath7- and @xmath8-bands , respectively .",
    "this makes this object redder in ( @xmath23 ) by 0.10@xmath180.04mag .",
    "the error bars take into account the dispersion observed from image to image , and from one observing run to another .",
    "we do not find a significant relative photometric variability in any member of the pair within 3@xmath4 the uncertainties . with the relative brightness of the two components and the combined flux known , it is possible to derive the individual absolute magnitudes of gl569ba and gl569bb .",
    "we list in table  [ phot ] the resulting decomposition for the @xmath7- and @xmath8-bands .",
    "the corresponding error bars incorporate the photometric uncertainties of the combined system gl569bab and the uncertainties of the relative photometry .",
    "we are confident that the latter is determined with a higher accuracy .",
    "we have obtained low resolution spectra of gl569ba and gl569bb in the @xmath7- ( 1.1581.368@xmath24 m ) and @xmath8-bands ( 1.9922.420@xmath24 m ) using the cross - dispersion spectrograph nirspec and the ao facility at the keckii telescope .",
    "the data were collected on 2000 june 20 . the raw seeing and",
    "transparency conditions were very good during the observations , and the ao correction applied to the primary star gl569a provided well resolved images of the binary system gl569bab ( ao corrected seeing of 0.05 ) .",
    "nirspec in its spectroscopic mode is equipped with an aladdin insb 1024@xmath171024 detector with a pixel projecting 0.0185  onto the sky . for the present study",
    ", we selected the low resolution spectroscopic mode which provides nominal dispersions of 2.8 / pix and 4.2 / pix in the @xmath7- and @xmath8-bands , respectively .",
    "the 3pixel - wide slit was aligned with the two components of the binary ( pa@xmath25139deg ) so that both targets were observed simultaneously .",
    "total exposure times were 240sec and 400sec for the @xmath7-band and @xmath8-band spectra , respectively .",
    "the observing strategy employed was as follows : 6 ( @xmath7 ) and 10 ( @xmath8 ) individual integrations of 20sec ( @xmath7 ) and 10sec ( @xmath8 ) each at two different positions along the entrance slit separated by about 1.8 .",
    "this procedure was repeated twice in the @xmath8-band . in order to remove telluric absorptions due to the earth s atmosphere",
    ", the near - infrared featureless a0v - type star hr5567 was observed very close in time and in air mass ( within 0.05 air masses ) .",
    "calibration images ( argon arc lamp emission spectra and white - light spectra ) were systematically taken after observing each source .",
    "raw data were reduced following conventional techniques in the near - infrared",
    ". nodded images were subtracted to remove the sky background and dark current .",
    "the spectra of the sources and of the calibration lamps were then extracted using subroutines of the twodspec package available in iraf .",
    "the extraction apertures of gl569ba and gl569bb were selected so that cross - contamination was less than 10% .",
    "the extracted spectra of the sources were divided by their corresponding normalized extracted flat - fields , and calibrated in wavelength .",
    "the 1@xmath4 dispersion of the fourth - order polynomial fit was 0.4  and 1.0  in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 spectra , respectively .",
    "the hydrogen p@xmath26 absorption line at 1.2818@xmath24 m and the b@xmath27 absorption line at 2.1655@xmath24 m in the spectra of hr5567 were interpolated before they were used for division into the corresponding science spectra .",
    "we are confident that the science spectra have good cancellation of atmospheric features . to complete the data reduction , we multiplied the spectra of our targets by the black body spectrum for the temperature of 9480k , which corresponds to the a0v class ( allen 2000 ) .",
    "the resultant average spectra with a resolution of @xmath6=1500 in @xmath7 and @xmath6=1700 in @xmath8 are depicted in fig .",
    "the strongest molecular and atomic features are indicated following the identifications provided by jones et al@xmath10 ( 1996 ) and mclean et al@xmath10 ( 2000 ) .",
    "the spectra of both components , gl569ba and gl569bb , are indeed very similar .",
    "the composite spectrum of gl569bab in the optical has been previously studied by henry & kirkpatrick ( 1990 ) and kirkpatrick , henry & mccarthy ( 1991 ) , who derived a dwarf spectral type of m8.5 .",
    "in addition , this object is listed in the table  1 of kirkpatrick et al@xmath10 ( 1991 ) as a primary dwarf spectral standard .",
    "our data agree with this measurement for the bright component gl569ba , and also provide evidence that gl569bb is not significantly cooler .",
    "this is fully consistent with the photometry presented above .",
    "we have obtained equivalent widths of the strongest observed atomic absorptions of ki and nai in the spectra ; the measurements are given in table  [ eqw ] .",
    "due to the low resolution of our data , the majority of these lines are considerably blended with other spectral features , e.g. the ki line at 1.2435@xmath24 m is contaminated by a strong molecular band of feh .",
    "the values in table  [ eqw ] have been extracted adopting the base of each line as the continuum .",
    "we find typical standard deviations in equivalent width close to 10%  over the reasonable range of possible continua .",
    "although this procedure does not give an absolute equivalent width , it is commonly used by different authors , and allows us to compare our values with those published in the literature .",
    "we have also measured the strengths of the h@xmath28o band at 1.330@xmath24 m and the co band at 2.294@xmath24 m in a way similar to that described in mclean et al@xmath10 ( 2000 ) , reid et al@xmath10 ( 2001b ) and jones et al@xmath10 ( 1994 ) .",
    "our measurements are listed in table  [ eqw ] with uncertainties of about 5% .",
    "all these values are comparable to those obtained from similar spectral type field stars , which suggests that neither gl569ba nor gl569bb have very discrepant metallicities or gravity .",
    "we note that the equivalent widths of the ki lines and the h@xmath28o and co absorptions in gl569bb appear to be slightly larger than in gl569ba , while the nai lines in the @xmath8-band spectrum are smaller .",
    "this trend is observed for decreasing temperatures ( jones et al@xmath10 1994 ) , and clearly indicates the cooler nature of gl569bb . by fitting a polynomial spectral type - equivalent width relation to the data available for spectral standard stars ( see reid et al@xmath10 2001b ) ,",
    "we conclude that the differences between ba & bb in our measurements are consistent with gl569bb being half a subclass cooler .",
    "this would make gl569bb an m9-dwarf ( @xmath180.5 subclasses ) .",
    "we used our low resolution near - ir spectra taken on 2000 june 20 ( mjd=51715.365 ) to compute the relative radial velocity of gl569bb and gl569ba via fourier cross - correlation . because the spectroscopic data have been corrected for telluric lines",
    ", we do not expect these lines to be a large source of uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , no spectra were taken of the primary star gl569a , so we can not determine the relative radial velocity of the pair with respect it .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the data is rather poor ( 1pixel@xmath2566kms@xmath29 in @xmath7 and @xmath2557kms@xmath29 in @xmath8 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the cross - correlation technique was able to achieve precisions of about 1/4pixel , so we obtained a relative radial velocity accurate to about 15kms@xmath29 .",
    "we verified this by cross - correlating individual spectra of each component against itself .",
    "the relative velocity ( gl569bb cross - correlated with gl569ba ) we measure is 25kms@xmath29 in @xmath7 and 6kms@xmath29 in @xmath8 , with an average value of 15.5kms@xmath29 .",
    "the peak - to - peak radial velocity variation of the system on the basis of the orbital solution presented in next section is around 14kms@xmath29 ; our measurement is consistent within the error bar with the expected value at the epoch of the observations .",
    "however , this error bar is rather large and prevents us from making further analysis ( like the presence of invisible companions ) .",
    "the maximum peak of the cross - correlation function is in the range 0.930.97 , which indicates the similarity and the high signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra .",
    "we determined the apparent orbit of the binary pair gl569bab by fitting a keplerian model to the relative astrometric data shown in table  [ ast ] . as the fit is non - linear in the orbital elements , we made use of a gradient - following fitting routine ( press 1992 ) to find the optimal ( in a chi - squared , @xmath30 , sense ) orbital parameter set . as there may be many local minima in the @xmath30 manifold , and our gradient following routine moves strictly downhill",
    ", we ensured that it found the global minimum by starting it at a range of different locations in parameter space .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ params ] , and the visual orbit is shown together with the astrometry in fig .  [ orbit ] .",
    "the @xmath31 of the residuals is 0.0024 , and the residuals do not show any long - term drifts . uncertainties ( assuming normal errors ) were estimated from the covariance matrix of the fit , scaled by the reduced chi - squared ( 0.96 ) .",
    "however , as apparent in fig .",
    "[ chi ] the best - fit values for the semi - major axis and period are correlated , leading to a lower uncertainty in the total mass .",
    "the mass uncertainty was estimated by finding contours in parameter space where the @xmath30 was increased by 2.3 , 6.2 and 11.8 respectively , corresponding to the 1@xmath4 , 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath4 contours .",
    "the 1@xmath4 , 2@xmath4 and 3@xmath4 mass ranges are 0.1140.135 , 0.1070.142 and 0.1010.150 @xmath32 respectively , while the best - fit values for the period and semi - major axis correspond to a total mass of 0.123 @xmath32 . from the relative photometry",
    "we infer that the mass ratio of the binary is close to , but not exactly , equal .",
    "hence the 2@xmath4 upper mass limit of the secondary gl569bb is less than 0.071@xmath32 , i.e@xmath10 below the hydrogen burning mass threshold , making it a likely brown dwarf .",
    "it is important to note that although we were able to obtain reliable relative astrometry of the ba - bb pair ( over a separation of @xmath33 ) , the uncertainties in plate scale and orientation and the saturation of the bright star in some images were such that we were unable to reliably measure the orbital motion of each component of the ba - bb pair with respect to a separate reference , i.e@xmath10 gl569a ( located @xmath34  away ) .",
    "hence , while we can determine the relative orbit of the ba - bb pair to a high degree of precision , we can not astrometrically determine the mass ratio of the two components .",
    "further studies are needed to confirm or discard the substellar nature of the primary gl569ba .",
    "we will combine our photometry ( absolute and relative ) , the total mass of the system and additional information available in the literature to compare the binary with the most recent evolutionary models .",
    "figure  [ photfig ] depicts the location of the gl569bab pair in the near - infrared color - magnitude diagram .",
    "to convert their observed magnitudes into absolute magnitudes we have used the astrometric parallax provided by hipparcos ( 0.10191@xmath180.00167 , perryman et al@xmath10 1997 ) , which is very similar to previous astrometric measurements ( heintz 1991 ) .",
    "also shown in this figure are the locations of very late - type dwarfs in the pleiades cluster ( @xmath25120myr , basri et al@xmath10 1996 ; martn et al@xmath10 1998 ; stauffer , schultz & kirkpatrick 1998 , we use a distance of 120 pc ) which have photometry available in the literature ( festin 1998 ; martn et al@xmath10 2000b ) , and of objects in the field .",

    "we have adopted solar metallicity in our studies because the photospheric abundance of the bright star gl569a has been determined to be very close to solar ( [ fe / h]=0.15 , zboril & byrne 1998 ) .",
    "although the lyon models do provide magnitudes and colors in the filters of interest , we preferred to compute them from the predicted luminosity and effective temperature at a given mass and age .",
    "this allows a direct comparison of the two sets of interior models and minimizes the effects of possible errors in the model atmosphere synthesis .",
    "we converted effective temperatures ( @xmath35 ) into colors by using the temperature scales of leggett et al@xmath10 ( 1998 ) for m - dwarfs and of basri et al@xmath10 ( 2000 ) for late - m and l - dwarfs .",
    "these two temperature scales should be consistent and complementary with each other as the authors make use of the same atmosphere models to obtain their results .",

    "no lithium feature is observed in the composite optical spectrum of gl569bab ( magazz et al@xmath10 1993 ) , thus implying that the binary is older than 0.12gyr .",

    "we use the most recent determination of the substellar mass limit at 0.072@xmath32 to define the stellar - substellar borderline . because this value is the smallest of those available in the literature ( see e.g@xmath10 grossman , hays & graboske 1974 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ; burrows et al@xmath10 1993 ) , our conclusions on substellarity will be conservative .",
    "we indicate in the figures the substellar mass boundary and the location of the 50%  depletion limit of lithium burning predicted by the two sets of models . we have obtained the luminosity and effective temperatures of our targets as explained above .",
    "the third - order polynomial fit that gives temperatures as a function of the observed ( @xmath23 ) color is the following :    @xmath46 @xmath47k    this fit has been calculated for colors in the range 0.852.06 ( spectral types m6l6 ) , and is based on the temperature calibrations provided by basri et al@xmath10 ( 2000 ) and leggett et al@xmath10 ( 2000 ) .",
    "bolometric corrections in the @xmath7- and @xmath8-bands from reid et al@xmath10 ( 2001b ) and bessell , castelli & plez ( 1998 ) , respectively , have been used to transform magnitudes into bolometric luminosities .",
    "the values we derive for the pair are listed in table  [ phot ] .",
    "the error bars in luminosity take into account the uncertainty of the distance modulus ( hipparcos ) and the photometric uncertainties , leading to a total uncertainty of @xmath180.07dex .",
    "the error bars assigned to the effective temperatures come from the uncertainty in the colors alone .",
    "these are in general a factor 2 larger than the @xmath31 of the polynomial fit describing the temperature calibration .",
    "models should be able to provide explanations to all physical properties so far known for gl569ba and gl569bb , i.e. , photometry , the total mass of the pair and the destruction of lithium . from fig .",
    "[ hrlyon ] we observe that the location of gl569ba is consistent with severe lithium depletion , in agreement with available optical spectroscopic observations .",
    "according to the lyon models , even the fainter companion gl569bb has depleted its lithium",
    ". the likely age of the system is in the range 0.21gyr , but only with younger ages is it possible to reproduce the astrometric total mass derived for the pair .",
    "therefore , the real constraint to the age of the system is given by the total mass rather than by the error bars in the figure .",
    "for the age of 300myr , the binary would be formed by objects of 0.069@xmath32 ( gl569ba ) and 0.059@xmath32 ( gl569bb ) , in good agreement with the mean orbital solution .",
    "both masses are below the stellar - substellar borderline and thus the two components would be brown dwarfs . for slightly older ages , individual masses would become larger , as would the total mass . on the basis of the largest possible astrometric total mass value at the 3@xmath4 level , the pair would be made up of an object on the substellar borderline with 0.078@xmath32 and a 0.070@xmath32-bd at the age of 500myr .",
    "we tabulate the possible masses of the pair as a function of age in table  [ masses ] ; these estimations rely on the lyon models .    the comparison with the arizona models shown in fig .",
    "[ hrarizona ] also yields very young ages ( 120500myr ) for the system , and thus also small masses for each of the components . to this point , theory and",
    "some observations seem to be consistent . however , the arizona evolutionary models predict hotter temperatures",
    "( by about 100k ) around the substellar mass limit at a given age than do the lyon models , and hence according to these models both gl569ba and gl569bb should have preserved a considerable amount of lithium in their atmospheres . only by assuming the highest temperatures allowed by the error bars can the arizona models account for the observed lithium depletion in gl569bab .",
    "this would move the pair to a location between 300myr and 500 myr in fig .",
    "[ hrarizona ] . in order to be consistent with the additional restriction of the astrometric total mass ,",
    "ages in the interval 300500myr are required ; the resulting masses are 0.0550.075@xmath32 for gl569ba and of 0.0480.068@xmath32 for gl569bb .",
    "collecting evidence from the orbital solution , photometry , spectroscopy , and the comparison with evolutionary models , the most likely scenario of the binary gl569bab is : two very late m - type bds with masses of 0.0550.078@xmath32 and 0.0480.070@xmath32 in a close orbit , in turn orbiting an early m - type 0.5@xmath32 star , the whole system with an age in the range 250500myr .",
    "such young ages found in nearby objects are not surprising since it now seems that the sun is located close to a region that was the site of substantial amounts of recent stellar formation ( zuckerman & webb 2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ masslum ] portrays the mass - luminosity relationship for different ages as given by the evolutionary models .",
    "the two members of the pair are plotted with error bars indicating the uncertainty in luminosity and the likely mass range of each component .",
    "masses that have depleted lithium by a factor 2 are also incorporated into the figure . according to the arizona models",
    ", gl569bb may have preserved lithium in its atmosphere , whereas this is quite unlikely based on the lyon models .",
    "therefore , lithium observations of this bd are needed in order to discriminate which model reproduces neatly the properties of the pair .",
    "in addition , precise radial velocity measurements of each component will lead to an accurate determination of the individual masses , and thus will also constitute a better constraint on the models .",
    "nevertheless , models do not appear to be far from reproducing the observational properties of gl569bab .",
    "delfosse et al@xmath10 ( 2000 ) show that the mass - luminosity relationship given by the lyon models reasonably describes the low - mass stellar regime in the field .",
    "the pair gl569bab has lower masses that belong to the substellar regime .",
    "brown dwarfs around stars have been reported in the recent years ( see table  5 in reid et al@xmath10 2001a for a compilation of the complete list ) , but to our knowledge none of them has been proved to be a binary itself .",
    "gl569bab turns out to be the first confirmed resolved binary bd as a companion to a star .",
    "the distance to gl569 implies a physical separation of 49au between the m2.5-type star and the substellar pair .",
    "this large separation and the high mass ratio ( @xmath48@xmath250.135 and 0.120 ) between the star and each of the bds favors the fragmentation of a self - gravitational collapsing molecular cloud as the most plausible explanation for the formation of the system ( boss 2000 ; bodenheimer 1998 ) . whether each component of the pair gl569bab originated from a second fragmentation and collapse process of a small cloud core is not clear ( the physical separation is 0.92au , and the mass ratio of the pair is @xmath48@xmath250.89 ) .",
    "the activity of the nascent low - mass star when it was gaining mass and becoming more luminous may have caused the disruption of the less massive collapsing core into two close substellar objects before the hydrostatic core could build up enough mass to eventually start hydrogen burning .",
    "energetic outflows and jets up to thousands of au in length have been detected in low - mass stars of very young star forming regions ( e.g. , reipurth et al@xmath10 2000 ; fridlund & liseau 1998 ) .",
    "we can not discard the possibility , however , that the protoplanetary disk around the star might have also played an important role in the origin of the companions .",
    "disks extending up to several hundred au are known to exist around stars ( bruhweiler et al@xmath10 1997 ) . clearly ,",
    "finding other similar systems will , in addition to providing additional dynamical masses , also contribute to our knowledge of the genesis of such interesting multiple low - mass binaries .",
    "we have obtained new observations of the gl569bab pair ( low - mass binary companion at a wide separation from the m2.5-type star gl569a ) , which have allowed us to derive the spectral types of each component and the orbital parameters of the system .",
    "we find that the total mass of the low - mass binary is @xmath49 ( 3-@xmath4 ) with two detected components of m8.5 and m9 spectral types ( half a subclass uncertainty ) completing one eccentric ( @xmath50=0.32@xmath180.02 ) orbit every 892@xmath1825days .",
    "we have also acquired new @xmath7 and @xmath8 near - ir photometry in order to locate gl569ba and gl569bb in the hr diagram and compare them with the most recent evolutionary models by the lyon group ( chabrier et al@xmath10 2000 ) and the arizona group ( burrows et al@xmath10 1997 ) .",
    "the pair is likely formed by two solar metallicity young brown dwarfs with masses in the interval 0.0550.078@xmath32 ( gl569ba ) and 0.0480.070@xmath32 ( gl569bb ) at the young ages of 250500myr .",
    "our adaptive optics images taken with the keckii telescope exclude the presence of any other resolved companion with @xmath8 magnitudes brighter than 16.5 ( 3@xmath4 ) at separations of 0.25  up to 2  from gl569bab .",
    "this detection limit corresponds to masses around 0.0150.02@xmath32 for the possible age range of the system .",
    "further radial velocity and astrometric measurements will be very valuable to detect giant planets , as well as to provide individual masses for each of the members of the pair .",
