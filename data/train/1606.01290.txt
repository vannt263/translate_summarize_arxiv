    "in the last decades the study of complex networks has attracted the attention of many researchers because many real processes evolve on these types of structures . in early stages of these studies researchers were focused on processes that develop on isolated networks , however , systems , in general , are not completely isolated , but interacting with other systems instead .",
    "these types of interacting systems , which are a special case of the class called networks of networks ( non ) , are composed of internal and external connections .",
    "non structures were successfully used to understand epidemic spreading @xcite , cascade of failures @xcite , diffusion @xcite and synchronization @xcite .",
    "synchronization phenomena is a relevant subject in many areas , such as in neurobiology @xcite , animal behavior @xcite , power - grid networks @xcite and so forth . in a relatively recent approach ,",
    "synchronization problems in complex networks are associated to the fluctuations of a scalar @xmath2 defined over the system @xcite .",
    "this scalar field is a measure of the amount of load that a node has to manage .",
    "for example , in the problem of queuing networks , the load is proportional to the waiting time that a node needs to complete his task .",
    "the load in a node must be reduced in order to avoid increasing the waiting time by distributing efficiently the loads and thus improving the synchronization . in this approach",
    "the fluctuations are given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the load of node @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the average value of the load over the network , @xmath7 is the system size , and @xmath8 is the statistical average . in the steady state",
    "the fluctuations reach a constant value @xmath9 , which depends on the topology of the network .",
    "this type of process was studied in networks with different topologies , but in the last few years many researches have focused on scale - free ( sf ) networks because they are obiquous in many real systems .",
    "these kinds of networks are characterized by a degree distribution @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the probability that a node has @xmath12 internal links and @xmath13 is the exponent of the power law distribution . in general",
    ", @xmath13 takes values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 in real sf networks .",
    "one of the most studied models of growth interface is the family model @xcite , which is a surface relaxation model ( srm ) . in this model , at each time - step a node is randomly chosen , and the node with the lowest amount of load or ` height ' between the selected node and its neighbors increases its load in one unit . in isolated sf networks with exponent",
    "@xmath16 it was found that the dependence of @xmath17 with the system size @xmath7 has a crossover between two different behaviors at a characteristic size @xmath18 : for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath17 @xmath21 constant for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "thus in the last regime the system is scalable , i.e. increasing the system size does not affect the fluctuations . in a more recent work @xcite the authors studied the srm in two interacting sf networks , in which a fraction @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) of nodes in each network is connected one by one through bidirectional external links , allowing diffusion from one network to another .",
    "they found that the synchronization improves as @xmath23 increases and reaches an improvement of @xmath25 for @xmath26 . in real systems however , nodes can have more than one external connection with nodes in the other networks , which implies a stronger interaction between the systems",
    ". this strong interaction may affect the processes that develop on structures of this type . in this work",
    "we are interested in understanding how the strong interaction between networks affects the synchronization of the system . for this purpose",
    "we study the srm model in two sf networks in which each node has @xmath0 external connections . in this study",
    "we only use stochastic simulations due to the fact that the heterogeneity of the sf networks and the lack of geometrical direction makes difficult any theoretical approach @xcite .",
    "we build two sf networks @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) using the molloy  reed algorithm @xcite , avoiding multiple and self connections , and we use a minimum degree @xmath29 to ensure that each network has a single component @xcite . in both networks",
    "every node @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , has @xmath32 internal connections with nodes in the same network and @xmath0 external connections with nodes in the other network . by simplicity",
    ", we consider the same number of external connections for all nodes .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 and @xmath34 the set of internal and external neighboring nodes respectively of node @xmath30 from network @xmath27 .",
    "we chose as initial condition all the scalar fields @xmath35 randomly distributed in the interval @xmath36 $ ] .    at each time",
    "step a node @xmath30 in one of the networks @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , is randomly chosen and receives a load unit . then :    \\1 ) the load diffuses to the node @xmath37 , which is the one with the smaller load in the set @xmath38 .",
    "we denote this process as the first internal diffusion .",
    "\\2 ) if @xmath39 is smaller than all the heights in the set @xmath40 , then the load is deposited in @xmath37 and @xmath41 .",
    "( color green in fig [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "otherwise the load diffuses to the node with the smaller height in the set @xmath42 .",
    "we denote this process as external diffusion .",
    "\\3 ) if an external diffusion takes place , step @xmath43 is repeated and , after a second internal diffusion , the load is deposited in a node @xmath44 in the network @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( color red in fig [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath47 .     and @xmath48 .",
    "a load unit is dropped in a node of one of the networks ( colored cubes ) and diffuses between nodes following the rules ( colored arrows ) , until it is finally deposited.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "for the simulations we build two sf networks with the same exponents @xmath49 and sizes @xmath50 to ensure that the system is in the scalable regime @xcite . as the two networks used here have the same exponent @xmath13 and same system size @xmath7 , the fluctuations @xmath51 on each network will be in average the same , thus by simplicity we drop the index @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we plot the square fluctuations in the steady state of each network @xmath52 as a function of the external connection parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we can observe that the synchronization of the system improves as @xmath0 increases and that the fluctuations converge asymptotically to the optimal value @xmath53 , which corresponds to the case @xmath54 .",
    "the reduction in the fluctuations when more external connections are added is due to the fact that the overloaded nodes in one network have the possibility to diffuse their excess of load to nodes that possesess lower levels of load in the other network .",
    "this external diffusion allows to synchronize nodes that have increasingly similar amounts of load .",
    "it is important to notice that for high interacting networks with @xmath55 , the value @xmath53 is independent of the exponent @xmath13 of the degree distribution because in this case the interaction between networks , represented by the external connections , dominates the dynamics and the saturation value of the synchronization .",
    "thus in this case of strong interaction the topology of the isolated networks represented by internal connections plays a minor role .",
    "more precisely , the nodes have more probability to diffuse to nodes in the other network because the number of external connections is much higher than the number of internal ones .     as a function of the external connections @xmath0 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the case @xmath54 . in the inset we plot",
    "the percentage of the maximum improvement that the synchronization can achieve compared to the isolated network @xmath57 as a function of @xmath0 . for small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath57 almost approaches its optimal value.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to visualize the relative improvement of the synchronization compared to the isolated network we compute the percentage of the maximum optimization that the system achieves for @xmath58 , @xmath59 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we plot @xmath57 as function of @xmath0 . from the plot we can observe that we do not need to have very high values of @xmath0 to get a good improvement , since @xmath57 approaches fast to the optimal case ( @xmath54 ) . as @xmath0 increases more connections",
    "are added in order to obtain some improvement in the synchronization , and this is very expensive compared to the resulting profit .",
    "for example , increasing @xmath0 from zero to five implies adding @xmath60 external connections and @xmath57 is about @xmath61 , when we increase @xmath0 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 we duplicate the external connections between networks and obtain only a @xmath64 of improvement over the previous case .",
    "this is a high cost to pay to only obtain a slight improvement in the synchronization of the system .     that a node with degree @xmath12 makes to the fluctuations as a function of @xmath12 , for @xmath1 ( black @xmath56 ) , @xmath48 ( red @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 ( green @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 ( blue @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 ( orange @xmath71 ) , and @xmath54 ( violet @xmath72 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath73 shown in the vertical axis are multiplied by @xmath74 .",
    "the curves exhibit a minimum around @xmath75 for all @xmath0 . for @xmath76",
    ", @xmath73 is a constant which does not depend on the topology of the networks.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to understand the role of the internal connections of the nodes in the fluctuations , we define the average contribution @xmath73 that nodes with degree @xmath12 made to @xmath52 , where @xmath73 is given by @xmath77 it is straightforward to show that @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] we plot @xmath73 as a function of the internal degree @xmath12 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "from this plot we can see that as @xmath12 increases @xmath73 decreases , reaching a minimum around @xmath75 . this behavior can be explained as follows : as @xmath12 increases the nodes have more neighboring nodes to which they can send their excess of load or from which they can receive load , approaching their height to @xmath79 .",
    "however around @xmath75 , the nodes have too many neighbors and start to act as load sinks , and thus high degree nodes become the most loaded of the system . as @xmath0 increases @xmath73 decreases for all the values of @xmath12 and as a consequence the synchronization improves , and in addition @xmath73 has a minor dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that the amount of load of all the nodes becomes similar and hence the external connections dominate the dynamics of the growth model over the internal topology of the network .",
    "thus @xmath73 has the same value regardless of the internal degree of a node when @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] we show only the values of @xmath73 for nodes with @xmath80 because the total contribution from higher degree nodes to the fluctuations is far smaller .    in order to explain why the main contributions to the fluctuations are reduced when the interaction between networks increases , we study the distribution of load of nodes with internal connectivity @xmath12 around the main value @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the average amount of load of nodes with degree @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] we plot the distributions of @xmath81 , for @xmath83 and for @xmath84 for different values of @xmath0 . from fig .",
    "[ fig.4](a ) , we can see that as the number of external connections increases for @xmath85 , the dispersion of these distributions is reduced .",
    "for example , when we increase @xmath0 from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , the dispersion is reduced from @xmath88 to @xmath89 . also these distributions have nodes with levels of load above and below the mean value , and with an average load very close to @xmath6 , regardless of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "these observations , which are also seen for @xmath90 not shown here confirm that the main reason of the reduction of the fluctuations is that nodes with small degree and load above the main value send their excess of load to nodes with also small degree and load below the main value through the external connections of the system .",
    "other values of dispersion of these distributions around the main value are displayed in table [ tabdisp ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig.4](b ) we can see that the distribution of @xmath91 for @xmath1 is not centered in @xmath86 .",
    "this is because , as explained above , nodes with @xmath92 act as load sinks and usually become over saturated in the growing process . as @xmath0 increases not only the width of the distribution is reduced but also it is centered close to @xmath86 .",
    "thus all the load distributions for different values of @xmath12 get closer as @xmath0 increases . adding external connections",
    "decreases the dispersion of the distributions , however due to the discrete nature of the rules of our growth model and the initial conditions , the reduction has a limit at which the distribution tends to a rectangular shape as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.4](b ) for @xmath93 . also from table [ tabdisp ] we can see that the values of the dispersion of the load distribution for @xmath83 are closer to the values for @xmath84 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "all the results shown in this table are qualitatively the same for other values of @xmath13 in the interval @xmath94 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that we expect that in non composed by more than two networks @xmath52 will be slightly smaller than in the case of two interacting networks , because the system will be able to perform more relaxation steps between networks .",

    "notice that the dispersion is @xmath95 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we studied the synchronization of a system of two interacting sf networks for a simple surface relaxation model , in which the nodes of each network are connected with @xmath0 nodes of the other network .",
    "we found that as @xmath0 increases the synchronization of the system improves , reaching an optimal value for @xmath54 .",
    "we also found that the addition of a small number of @xmath0 connections results in a similar improvement compared to the case @xmath54 .",
    "this is important because an increase in the value of @xmath0 requires to add a large number of external connections to the system , which is very expensive from an economic point of view .",
    "we explain the reduction of the fluctuations in each network when @xmath0 increases , by the decrease of the contributions from nodes with small degree , which is a consequence of the external connections that reduce the dispersion of load of these nodes around the mean value .    in future works we will explore another type of external connection , such as external connections taken from a distribution .",
