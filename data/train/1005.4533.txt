    "quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) is an effective relativistic quantum field theory , based on mesons and baryons , which can be used at hadronic energy scales where the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , presents a highly nonlinear behavior .",
    "the walecka model @xcite to be considered here represents qhd by means of a lagrangian density formulated so as to describe nucleons interacting through the exchange of an isoscalar vector meson ( @xmath2 ) as well as of a scalar - isoscalar meson ( @xmath3 ) which is introduced to simulate intermediate range attraction due to the @xmath4-wave isoscalar pion pairs . the original walecka model ( qhd - i ) is described by the lagrangian density    @xmath5 \\psi + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi- m_s^2 \\phi^2 ) -\\frac { 1}{4 } f_{\\mu \\nu}f^{\\mu \\nu } + \\frac{1}{2 } m_v^2 v_\\mu v^\\mu - u(\\phi , v ) + { \\cal l}_{\\rm ct}\\ ; ,   \\label{lagnlwm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 denote respectively baryon , scalar and vector meson fields ( with the latter being coupled to a conserved baryonic current ) .",
    "the term @xmath7 , which describes mesonic self interactions was set to zero in the original model so as to minimize the many body effects while the term @xmath8 represents the counterterms needed to eliminate any potential ultra violet divergences arising from vacuum computations .",
    "it is important to recall that , roughly , counterterms are composed by two distinct parts the first being a divergent piece which exactly eliminates the divergence resulting from the evaluation of a green function at a given order in perturbation theory .",
    "the second piece is composed by a finite part which is _ arbitrary _ and can be fixed by choosing an appropriated renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "the important parameters are the ratios of coupling to masses , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 which are tuned to fit the saturation density @xmath12 and binding energy per nucleon , @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "however , the qhd - i predictions for some other relevant static properties of nuclear matter do not agree well with the values quoted in the literature . for example , using the mean field approximation ( mfa ) which considers only in medium contributions at the one loop level one obtains that , at saturation , the effective nucleon mass is @xmath14 , which is somewhat low , while the compression modulus , @xmath15 , is too high . in principle , since this is a renormalizable quantum field theory , vacuum contributions ( and potential ultra violet divergences ) can be properly treated yielding meaningful finite results .",
    "these contributions were first considered by chin @xcite , at the one loop level , in the so called relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) which produced a more reasonable value for the effective mass , @xmath16 . however , the compression modulus remained at a high value , @xmath17 .",
    "one could then try to improve the situation by also considering exchange contributions since both , mfa and rha , consider only direct terms in a nonperturbative way . when vacuum contributions are neglected this approximation is known as the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation producing @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite . by comparing the results from mfa , rha and hf",
    "one sees how vacuum effects can improve the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then , the natural question is if the situation could be further improved by considering the vacuum in hf type of evaluations .",
    "the main concern now being the difficulty to deal with overall , nested , and overlapping type of divergences which surely arise due to the self consistent procedure .",
    "the complete evaluation of vacuum contributions within direct and exchange terms was performed by furnstahl , perry and serot @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an early attempt in which only the propagators have been fully renormalized ) .",
    "this cumbersome calculation considers the nonperturbative evaluation and renormalization of the energy density up to the two loop level showing the non convergence of the loop expansion .",
    "later , the situation has been addressed with the alternative optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) which allows for an easier manipulation of divergences @xcite .",
    "two loop contributions have been evaluated and renormalized in a perturbative fashion with nonperturbative results further generated via a variational criterion .",
    "however , saturation of nuclear matter could not be achieved with the results supporting those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the compressibility modulus problem has been circumvented by introducing some more parameters , in the form of new couplings @xcite , to the original walecka model .",
    "one then considers @xmath7 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ lagnlwm ] ) as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this version of qhd is known as the nonlinear walecka model ( nlwm ) and the main role of the two additional parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , is to bring the compression modulus of nuclear matter and the nucleon effective mass under control .",
    "however , one may object to this course of action since the mesonic self interactions will increase the many body effects apart from increasing the parameter space .",
    "notice also that terms like @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are not allowed since then , in 3 + 1 dimensions , one would need to introduce coupling parameters with negative mass dimensions spoiling the renormalizability of the original model .",
    "apart from increasing the parameter space .",
    "heide and rudaz @xcite have then realized that it is still possible to keep @xmath29 while improving both @xmath21 and @xmath30 .",
    "the key ingredient in their approach is related to the complete evaluation ( regularization and renormalization ) of divergent vacuum contributions .",
    "regularization is a formal way to isolate the divergences associated with a physical quantity for which many different prescriptions exist , e.g. , sharp cut - off , pauli - villars , and dimensional regularization ( dr ) . within dr , which was used by chin ,",
    "one basically performs the evaluations in @xmath31 dimensions taking @xmath32 at the end so that the ultra violet divergences show up as powers of @xmath33 .",
    "however , to keep the dimensionality right when doing @xmath34 one has to introduce _ arbitrary _ scales with dimensions of energy ( @xmath35 , or the related , where @xmath36 . ] @xmath37 ) .",
    "chin has chosen a renormalization prescription in which the final results do not depend on the arbitrary energy scale while heide and rudaz chose one in which such a dependence remains , as in most qcd applications .",
    "since the latter authors also worked at the one loop level their approximation became known as the modified relativistic hartree approximation ( mrha ) and their main result was to show that it is possible to substantially improve @xmath21 and @xmath30 by suitably fixing the energy scale , @xmath35 . moreover by choosing @xmath38 the mrha recovers rha . in connection with neutron stars ,",
    "the mrha has been applied to the walecka model in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here one of our goals is to treat the walecka model using a formalism which is closely related to the one used in qcd and other modern quantum field theories . within the qhd model , the temperature and density",
    "are usually introduced using the real time formalism employed in the original work of walecka .",
    "instead , we use matsubara s imaginary time formalism treating the divergent integrals with dr adapted to the modified minimal subtraction renormalization scheme @xmath39 @xcite which constitute the framework most commonly used within qcd . to obtain the ground state energy density , @xmath40",
    ", we will first evaluate the effective potential ( or landau s free energy ) , @xmath41 , whose minimum gives the pressure , @xmath42 . by choosing appropriate renormalization conditions we generate effective three- and four - body couplings , in @xmath41 , which are not present at the classical level .",
    "as we shall see the numerical values of these effective couplings run with the energy scale , @xmath37 , allowing for a good tuning of @xmath21 and @xmath30 which have their values improved at energy scales of about @xmath43-@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) while the usual rha results are retrieved for the choice @xmath46 .",
    "the mrha proposed by heide and rudaz suggests that if one seeks to minimize many - body effects in nuclear matter _ at saturation _ , the choice @xmath47 is the necessary one .",
    "our philosophy is slightly different and perhaps simpler to implement .",
    "since possible modifications in the behavior of @xmath21 and @xmath48 seem to be dictated by the presence of @xmath49 and @xmath50 type of terms we shall use the chin - walecka renormalization prescription to deal with @xmath27 ( @xmath51 ) vacuum contributions by requiring that their respective contributions vanish at zero density ( a requirement which was also adopted within the mrha ) .",
    "however , as far as the vacuum contributions related to @xmath0 and @xmath1 are concerned we advocate that one only needs to keep the finite energy scale dependent parts in the effective three- and four - body couplings . in this way ,",
    "not only @xmath52 and @xmath53 run with @xmath37 but , as we shall see , one also retrieves the rha at @xmath46 .    considering the effective potential at zero density we will choose an appropriate renormalization prescription for this particular model .",
    "since our main goal is to improve @xmath21 and @xmath54 by quantically renormalizing @xmath55 and @xmath56 we can keep @xmath57 as representing _ the _ vacuum physical masses for simplicity .",
    "this choice means that , at @xmath58 , all mass parameters ( @xmath59,@xmath60,@xmath61 ) represent the effective vacuum masses and shall not run with @xmath37 as opposed to @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in theories such as qcd",
    "the running of the couplings is dictated by the @xmath62 function whose most important contributions come from the so - called leading logs , e.g. @xmath63 , which naturally arise in dr evaluations . the application of rg equations to the effective model walecka model is beyond the scope of our work . nevertheless , our renormalization prescription to obtain a scale dependence so as to better control @xmath21 and @xmath54 is inspired by the leading logs role in the @xmath62 function and the the renormalization scheme presented here proposes that one should preserve only the scale dependent leading logs which appear in the expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . as a byproduct , and contrary to the mrha case",
    ", both quantities will display the same scale dependence . here",
    ", this approximation will be called the logarithmic hartree approximation ( lha ) .",
    "the numerical results show that the best lha predictions for @xmath21 and @xmath30 are obtained at energy scales which are only about @xmath64 smaller than that of the rha , that is @xmath65 .",
    "this is a nice feature since the values of the energy scale and that of the highest mass in the spectrum are almost the same whereas in the mrha the optimum scale , set to be close to @xmath54 is about @xmath66 smaller than @xmath59 . from the quantitative point of view , the lha produces better results than the mrha as will be shown .    the work is presented as follows . in the next section the one loop free energy is evaluated using matsubara s formalism .",
    "the renormalization of the vacuum contributions is discussed in section iii and the complete renormalized energy density is presented in section iv .",
    "numerical results and discussions appear in section v where while our conclusions are presented in section vi . for completeness , in the appendix",
    ", we discuss a case in which @xmath60 does not represent the physical mass .",
    "in quantum field theories the effective potential ( or landau s free energy ) , @xmath67 , is defined as the generator of all one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green s functions with zero external momentum . the standard textbook definition ( for one field , @xmath3 ) reads @xcite @xmath68 where have absorbed non relevant factors of @xmath69 and @xmath70 by defining @xmath71 with @xmath72 representing the 1pi @xmath73-point green s function and @xmath74 representing the classical ( space - time independent ) scalar field .",
    "in practice , this quantity incorporates quantum ( or radiative ) corrections to the classical potential which appears in the original lagrangian density .",
    "while the latter is always finite the former can diverge due to the evaluation of momentum integrals present in the feynman loops .",
    "one way to obtain this free energy density is to perform a functional integration over the fermionic fields @xcite . to one loop",

    "this contribution is renormalized by the constant counterterm @xmath132 which can be referred to as the `` cosmological constant '' @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the only effect this term has is to give the zero point energy value and by its complete elimination one assures that @xmath133 which , within the walecka model , will later assure that the pressure as well as the energy density vanish at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , as in the on - mass shell prescription , we can impose that @xmath130 be exactly equal to the finite part of the @xmath131 term .",
    "it is important to point out that even if one uses the @xmath95 scheme this term can be absorbed in a vacuum expectation value subtraction of the zero point energy so that the exact way in which it done is not too relevant for the present purposes .",
    "the effect of the the linear ( tadpole ) term @xmath134 is to shift the origin so that the minimum is not at the origin ( @xmath135 ) as shown by the dashed line of fig .",
    "also any finite contribution left in the tadpole will cause direct terms to contribute to the baryon self energy which , at the present level of approximation , means that @xmath59 does not represent the physical nucleon mass at @xmath58 , @xmath136 .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that the baryon self - energy is @xmath137 so that the vacuum effective baryon mass is given by @xmath138 and since @xmath139 one sees that @xmath59 , as well as @xmath140 and @xmath60 , should depend on @xmath121 . however , for the purposes of controlling @xmath21 and @xmath54 the renormalization of the baryonic vacuum mass from @xmath59 to @xmath136 does not generate the wanted @xmath0 and @xmath1 vertices .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we can also set @xmath141 so as to completely eliminate the tadpole vacuum contribution .",
    "this choice for @xmath130 and @xmath141 together with @xmath142 produces the dot - dashed line of figure [ lrha ] .",
    "the term @xmath143 represents a ( momentum independent ) vacuum correction to the scalar meson mass , @xmath60 . as in the previous case , getting rid of this term assures that @xmath60 be taken as the physical mass simplifying the calculations since @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "fixing @xmath146 so as to completely eliminate the @xmath143 contribution produces the dotted line of figure [ lrha ] . in summary , so far we have adopted the usual chin - walecka on - mass shell renormalization conditions for @xmath147 , and @xmath148 so that : the vacuum energy is normalized to zero , @xmath149 is the minimum of @xmath41 ( also meaning that @xmath150 ) , while @xmath60 represents the vacuum scalar meson mass . in this approach , none of the vacuum mass parameters present in the original lagrangian density run with @xmath121 .",
    "note that , physically , our choice was also inspired by the nlwm observation that the compressibility modulus is improved by the introduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms which is consistent with our choice of neglecting any corrections to terms proportional to @xmath151 and @xmath152 which are directly related with the scalar meson and baryon masses .",
    "now , taking @xmath153 and @xmath154 would leave us with the wanted @xmath0 and @xmath1 scale dependent terms .",

    "<S> we evaluate the effective potential for the conventional linear walecka non perturbatively up to one loop . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is then renormalized with a prescription which allows finite vacuum contributions to the three as well as four 1pi green s functions to survive . </S>",
    "<S> these terms , which are absent in the standard relativistic hartree approximation , have a logarithmic energy scale dependence that can be tuned so as to mimic the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 type of terms present in the non linear walecka model improving quantities such as the compressibility modulus and the effective nucleon mass , at saturation , by considering energy scales which are very close to the nucleon mass at vanishing density . </S>"
