    "superconducting bulks can be magnetized in several ways .",
    "the most common is field - cool magnetization , consisting on placing a bulk in a dc magnet where the sample is above the critical temperature , @xmath6 , decrease the temperature below @xmath6 , and reduce the applied magnetic field from a certain initial value to zero .",
    "the maximum trapped field in the sc is reached when the initial applied field is above the saturation field @xcite . alternatively , the sample could be cooled down at zero applied field , increase the applied field , and come back to zero . in this case , achieving the maximum trapped field requires a peak applied field that is twice the bulk - saturation field .",

    "the present article provides an insight of this kind of magnetization . in certain applications , such as motors , it could be more convenient to use pulse magnetization @xcite .",

    "the @xmath53 component reaches values as high as 30 % of @xmath57 ( figure [ cubecjz.fig ] ) .",

    "this @xmath53 bends the current flux lines , as seen in the 3d current loops in figure [ jline3d.fig ] .",
    "the cause of this @xmath53 component is the self - field . in cylinders ,",
    "the radial component of the self - field , perpendicular to the current loops , is balanced by higher current penetration close to the ends @xcite .",
    "that is possible thanks to the cylindrical symmetry , which causes that the radial field is uniform in any circular loop .",
    "this no longer applies to rectangular prisms .",
    "the magnetic field created by rectangular loops at the diagonal is higher than closer to the straight parts at the same distance from the lateral faces @xcite .",
    "thus , higher current penetration close to the ends following rectangular loops can not fully cancel the self - field .",
    "close to the diagonals , the additional perpendicular self - field pointing inwards is canceled by a @xmath53 component that changes its sign at the diagonal . for applied fields well above the saturation field , the self - field is not relevant , and hence the current paths follow rectangular loops in the whole sample .",

    "figure [ cubec0.1.fig ] also shows the projections in the @xmath52 plane of the 3d current flux lines .",
    "an interesting issue is that the current loops do not close within the same plane .",
    "the roughly straight segments close to one side ( point 1 at figures [ cubec0.1.fig]c and [ cubec0.1jz.fig]c ) bend downwards when approaching to the diagonal ( point 2 at figures [ cubec0.1.fig]c and [ cubec0.1jz.fig]c ) , where @xmath61 , reach a lower layer , where @xmath62 is slightly below @xmath11 , and bend in the @xmath52 plane , describing roughly a circular arc .",
    "thus , the current follows non - square loops , while keeping a star - shaped current - free zone at the planes close to the center .",
    "the @xmath16 bending of the current lines is compatible with @xmath63 exactly at the mid - plane because the @xmath16-bending for the current lines at slightly above and slightly below @xmath54 is in opposite directions ( top graph of figure [ jline3d.fig ] ) .",
    "current loops close to the prism side surfaces are still nearly square ( figure 3 ) .",
    "non - square current paths in thin films with regions with @xmath64 were found in @xcite from numerical modeling and in @xcite from inversion of measured magnetic field maps .",
    "although thin film models assume uniform @xmath5 along the film thickness , their predictions are valid for the thickness - averaged @xmath5 of samples with small but finite thickness .",
    "our calculations for the thinnest sample ( @xmath59 ) qualitatively agree with the thin - film calculations and measurements ( figure [ jav.fig ] ) .",
    "the thickness - averaged current paths from thin films can not be obtained by superposing square paths at several heights because they always result in square current paths .",
    "therefore , non - square current paths need to exist in prisms , at least below their saturation field .",
    "in addition , the arguments above justifying the non - zero @xmath11 are valid for any aspect ratio .",
    "this constrasts with earlier predictions in @xcite for a cube , where in - plane square loops were assumed .",
    "this assumption was supported by taking into account that @xmath62 follows @xmath65 or 0 only , while the csm allows any @xmath66 .",
    "current densities with magnitude slightly below @xmath11 are enough to bend @xmath5 vertically and obtain the necessary @xmath53 to shield the self - field .",

    "after increasing the applied field to the effective saturation field , defined in section [ s.bpm ] , the magnitude of @xmath53 reduces and the current flux lines become closer to squares ( figure [ cubejcbp.fig ] ) . well above the effective saturation field , the current flux lines are perfectly square ( figure [ cubejc2bp.fig ] ) .",

    "this definition of @xmath48 is more relevant than previous ones , being the applied field that fully saturates the sample with critical current @xcite or the self - field at the sample center at full current penetration @xcite .",
    "the cause is that @xmath81 for thin samples practically saturates at applied fields much lower than @xmath48 from the previous definitions @xcite .",
    "indeed , a perfectly thin film requires an infinite applied field to be fully saturated with current @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xmath48 as @xmath82 is practical for experimentalists , since it is tolerant to measurement errors in the @xmath83 curve .",
    "note that for our definition of saturation field , the sample is actually not fully penetrated by current ( figure [ cubejcbp.fig ] ) , since the current loops close to the cube axis parallel to @xmath16 contribute very little to the magnetic moment .",

    "<S> bulk superconductors are used in both many applications and material characterization experiments , being the bulk shape of rectangular prism very frequent . </S>",
    "<S> however the magnetization currents are still mostly unknown for this kind of three dimensional ( 3d ) shape , specially below the saturation magnetic field . knowledge of the magnetization currents in this kind of samples is needed to interpret the measurements and the development of bulk materials for applications . </S>",
    "<S> this article presents a systematic analysis of the magnetization currents in prisms of square base and several thicknesses . </S>",
    "<S> we make this study by numerical modeling using a variational principle that enables high number of degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the magnetization loops and the saturation magnetic field , using a definition that is more relevant for thin prisms than previous ones . </S>",
    "<S> the article presents a practical analytical fit for any aspect ratio . for applied fields below the saturation field , the current paths are not rectangular , presenting 3d bending . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness - average results are consistent with previous modeling and measurements for thin films . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d bending of the current lines indicates that there could be flux cutting effects in rectangular prisms . </S>",
    "<S> the component of the critical current density in the applied field direction may play a role , being the magnetization currents in a bulk and a stack of tapes not identical . </S>"
