    "however , it is still a great challenge to build a large - scale quantum computer .",
    "quantum computers can significantly outperform classical computers in doing some specific tasks @xcite .",

    "this search algorithm has been found to be very useful in other related problems @xcite . to date , the study of quantum algorithms is a very active area of research ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    using three coupled harmonic oscillators ,",
    "we have recently proposed @xcite an alternative approach ( without using qubits ) for quantum factorization .",
    "we consider these three harmonic oscillators to be coupled together via nonlinear interactions @xcite .",
    "to factorize an integer @xmath0 , this approach involves only three steps : initialization , time evolution , and conditional measurement . in this approach ,",
    "the states of the first two harmonic oscillators are prepared in a number - state basis , while the state of the third oscillator is prepared in a coherent state .",
    "the states of the first two harmonic oscillators encode the trial factors of the number @xmath0 .",
    "the nonlinear interactions between the oscillators produce coherent states that simultaneously rotate in phase space with different effective frequencies , which are proportional to the product of two trial factors @xcite . in this way , _ all _ possible products of any two trial factors can be _ simultaneously _ computed , and then they are `` written '' to the rotation frequencies of the coherent states in _ a single step_. this saves considerable computational resources .",
    "the resulting state of the first two oscillators is the factors state @xcite by performing a conditional measurement of a coherent state rotating with an effective frequency which is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "however , the probability of obtaining this coherent state becomes low when @xmath0 is large . in this paper",

    "initially , the first two harmonic oscillators are in a number - state basis and the third oscillator is in a coherent state . let the three coupled harmonic oscillators evolve for a period of time .",
    "the detection is then conditioned on a coherent state with a rotation frequency being proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of finding this coherent state can be adjusted by choosing both an appropriate period of time evolution and magnitude of the coherent state . here",
    "we find that this probability is not small . indeed",
    ", the probability of finding the factors state can be increased by a factor which is the reciprocal of the probability of obtaining this coherent state .",
    "the resulting states of the first two oscillators , after the first step , are used as new input states in the second step of our approach .",
    "also , the state of the third oscillator is now prepared as a coherent state with the same , or higher , magnitude . by repeating the same procedure described in the first step , we can obtain the states of the factors with a much higher probability .",
    "we then iterate these procedures @xmath1 times , until the probability of finding the factors state is close to one . as an example of how this method works ,",
    "we show how to factorize the integer @xmath4 . here",
    "the probabilities of obtaining coherent states , with rotation frequencies proportional to @xmath0 , are larger than 0.1 in each iteration .",
    "the probability of finding the factors can reach nearly one after 12 iterations .",
    "in addition , this amplitude - amplification method can be applied to search problems by suitably controlling nonlinear interactions between the harmonic oscillators and making appropriate conditional measurements .",
    "this approach can search a `` target '' from @xmath0 possible inputs in _",
    "linear time_. it surpasses grover s algorithm which only provides a quadratic speed - up for searching @xcite .",
    "since np - complete problems such as 3-sat , the traveling salesman problem , etc @xcite , can be mapped into search problems @xcite .",
