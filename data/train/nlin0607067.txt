    "one of the main problems in the modern theory of fully developed turbulence is to verify the validity of the basic principles of kolmogorov - obukhov ( ko ) phenomenological theory and their consequences within the framework of a microscopic model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent experimental , numerical and theoretical studies signify the existence of deviations from the well - known kolmogorov scaling behavior . the scaling behavior of the velocity fluctuations with exponents , which values are different from kolmogorov ones , is known as anomalous and is associated with intermittency phenomenon @xcite . even thought the understanding of the intermittency and anomalous scaling within the theoretical description of the fluid turbulence on basis of the `` first principles '' , i.e. , on the stochastic navier - stokes equation , still remains an open problem , considerable progress has been achieved in the studies of the simplified model systems which share some important properties of the real turbulence .    the crucial role in these studies",
    "is played by models of advected passive scalar field @xcite .",
    "maybe the most known model of this type is a simple model of a passive scalar quantity advected by a random gaussian velocity field , white in time and self - similar in space , the so - called kraichnan s rapid - change model @xcite .",
    "it was shown by both natural and numerical experimental investigations that the deviations from the predictions of the classical ko phenomenological theory is even more strongly displayed for a passively advected scalar field than for the velocity field itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "at the same time , the problem of passive advection is much more easier to be consider from theoretical point of view .",
    "there , for the first time , the anomalous scaling was established on the basis of a microscopic model @xcite , and corresponding anomalous exponents was calculated within controlled approximations ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .    in paper @xcite the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) and operator - product expansion ( ope )",
    "were used in the systematic investigation of the rapid - change model .",
    "it was shown that within the field theoretic approach the anomalous scaling is related to the very existence of so - called `` dangerous '' composite operators with negative critical dimensions in ope ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .    afterwards ,",
    "various generalized descendants of the kraichnan model , namely , models with inclusion of large and small scale anisotropy @xcite , compressibility @xcite and finite correlation time of the velocity field @xcite were studied by the field theoretic approach .",
    "general conclusion is : the anomalous scaling , which is the most important feature of the kraichnan rapid change model , remains valid for all generalized models .    in paper",
    "@xcite the problem of a passive scalar advected by the gaussian self - similar velocity field with finite correlation time @xcite was studied by the field theoretic rg method . there",
    ", the systematic study of the possible scaling regimes and anomalous behavior was present at one - loop level .",
    "the two - loop corrections to the anomalous exponents were obtained in @xcite . in paper",
    "@xcite the influence of compressibility on the problem studied in @xcite was analyzed .",
    "the effects of the presence of helicity in the system on the scaling regimes and anomalous dimensions were studied in @xcite within of two - loop approximation .",
    "it was shown that although the separate composite operators which define anomalous dimensions strongly depend on the helicity parameter the resulting two - loop contributions to the critical dimensions of the structure functions are independent of helicity .",
    "this rather intriguing result can have at least two independent explanations .",
    "first , it can be simply a two - loop result which will be changed when one will study three - loop approximation .",
    "second , more interesting conclusion ( but it is only a speculation for now ) is that this situation will be held at each level of the perturbation theory while the assumption of incompressibility or isotropy will be supposed . from this point of view",
    ", the investigation of the compressible system together with assumption of helicity of the system within two - loop approximation can give an interesting answer .",
    "for this purpose in @xcite the influence of compressibility of the model on the stability of the scaling regimes was studied and the restrictions on the parameter space were analyzed . in what follows , we shall continue these studies and our aim will be to find combine effects of helicity and compressibility on the stability of the scaling regimes in two - loop approximation",
    ". it can be consider as the starting point for the subsequent investigation of the anomalous scaling of the correlator or structure functions of a passive scalar .",
    "the advection of a passive scalar field is described by equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a passive scalar field , @xmath8 is the molecular diffusivity coefficient , @xmath9 is compressible velocity field , and @xmath10 is a gaussian random noise with zero mean and correlation function @xmath11 where parentheses @xmath12 denote average over corresponding statistical ensemble . the noise maintains the steady - state of the system but its concrete form is not essential .",
    "@xmath13 denotes an integral scale related to the stirring .",
    "in real problems the velocity field @xmath9 satisfies stochastic navier - stokes equation but we shall suppose that the velocity field obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and correlator @xmath14 here @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the non - helical transverse projector , @xmath17 is longitudinal projector with the compressibility parameter @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the helical transverse projector with helicity parameter @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is levi - civita s completely antisymmetric tensor of rank 3 , and @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the dimensionality of the @xmath24 space which must be taken @xmath25 in the helical case ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the function @xmath27 is taken in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the exponent @xmath0 describe the equal - time velocity correlator ( the energy spectrum ) .",
    "on the other hand , the constant @xmath30 and the exponent @xmath1 are related to the frequency @xmath31 , characteristic of the mode @xmath3 . in our model",
    "the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 play the role of the rg expansion parameters .",
    "the model contains two special cases . in the limit @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "one obtains the so - called rapid - change model , and the limit @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponds to the case of a `` frozen '' velocity field @xcite .    the stochastic problem ( [ model])-([model1 ] ) is equivalent to the field theoretic model of the set of fields @xmath36 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with action functional @xmath37^{-1 } v_j(t_2,{\\bf x_2 } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int dt\\,d^d{\\bf x}\\,\\ , \\theta^{\\prime}\\left[-\\partial_t \\theta - v_i\\partial_i\\theta+\\nu_0\\triangle\\theta \\right ] , \\label{action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the unimportant term related to the noise ( [ correlator ] ) is omitted , @xmath38 is an auxiliary scalar field , and summations are implied over the vector indices . the second line in ( [ action1 ] ) represents the martin - siggia - rose action for the stochastic problem ( [ model ] ) at fixed velocity field @xmath39 , and the first line describes the gaussian averaging over @xmath39 defined by the correlator @xmath40 in ( [ model1 ] ) and ( [ model15 ] ) .",
    "the functional formulation ( [ action1 ] ) means that statistical averages of random quantities in the stochastic problem defined by ( [ model ] ) and ( [ model1 ] ) corresponds to functional averages with the weight @xmath41 .",
    "using the standard analysis of quantum field theory one can find that the uv divergences are only present in the one - particle - irreducible green functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "we shall calculate them in 2-loop approximation in the minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "our model is multiplicatively renormalizable which is represented by the following relations between renormalized and bare parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the renormalization mass .",
    "one and two - loop feynman diagrams which contribute to the renormalization constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be found in @xcite .",
    "they have the following form @xmath53 where the one - loop contributions are ( in the ms - scheme ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is @xmath23 dimensional sphere given by the expression @xmath56 .",

    "one can define the corresponding anomalous dimensions @xmath57 and @xmath58 functions for all invariant charges ( @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 . in our case",
    "we have @xmath61 and @xmath62    now one has all necessary tools to begin with analysis of possible scaling regimes of the model .",
    "it is well known that possible scaling regimes of a renormalizable model are associated with the infrared ( ir ) stable fixed points of the corresponding rg equations .",
    "the fixed points are determined from the requirement that all @xmath58 functions are vanish : @xmath63 , where @xmath59 and @xmath64 are coordinates of the corresponding fixed point .",

    "the fixed point is ir stable if all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath66 are positive ( precisely their real parts ) . in our model",
    "we have five types of possible scaling regimes related to fixed points of the model .",
    "first of all , we shall investigate the rapid - change limit : @xmath67 . in this regime",
    ", it is necessary to make transformation to new variables , namely , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , with the corresponding changes in the @xmath58 functions : @xmath70 in this case we have two fixed points which we denote as i and ii .",

    "the matrix @xmath66 is diagonal with the elements ( eigenvalues ) : @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the corresponding scaling regime is ir stable if @xmath75 and , at the same time , @xmath76 .",
    "the second one is defined as follows    * fixed point ii : * @xmath77 , and @xmath78 where we denote @xmath79 .",
    "the anomalous dimension @xmath80 at the fixed point is @xmath81 .",
    "these are exact one - loop results .",
    "it is the consequence of the non - existence of the higher - loop corrections .",
    "corresponding matrix of the first derivatives is triangular with diagonal elements ( eigenvalues ) @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the conditions @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the ir stable regime lead to the inequalities : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the second nontrivial limit of our general model is so - called frozen limit given by @xmath88 . in this case , it is again necessary to make transformation to new variables , namely , @xmath89 and @xmath90 is unchanged .",
    "it leads to the changes in the @xmath58 functions which are now define as follows ( @xmath91 is the same as in the general case ) @xmath92 in this case we have again two fixed points which we denote as iii and iv .",
    "first of them is trivial one , namely    * fixed point iii : * @xmath93 .",
    "+ the corresponding matrix @xmath66 is diagonal with the elements : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it means that the corresponding scaling regime is ir stable if @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the second one is defined as follows    * fixed point iv : * @xmath98 , and @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 are expressions from ( [ const ] ) taken in the given limit and again @xmath103 . in this case",
    "we have the relation @xmath104 between anomalous dimensions .",
    "the matrix of the first derivatives is triangular with eigenvalues ( diagonal elements ) : @xmath105 in the helical case , when helicity parameter @xmath26 , one must work with @xmath25 , and we obtain @xmath106 therefore , the conditions to have @xmath107 and @xmath85 are @xmath108 these inequalities define the region in the parameter space for which the scaling regime is ir stable .    the last but the most interesting scaling regime is obtained when one assume that @xmath109 .",
    "let us briefly discuss this case .",
    "the corresponding ir fixed point will be denoted as v. the coordinates of the fixed point is now defined by the requirement of vanishing of the @xmath58 functions which are given in ( [ betas ] ) .",
    "the fixed point value for @xmath110 is given as    * fixed point v : * @xmath111 + @xmath112 where the functions @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are given in ( [ const ] ) , and where the parameter @xmath90 is taken at its fixed point value @xmath115 which is defined implicitly by the equation @xmath116 the analysis of the problem is relatively simple in one - loop level , where explicit expressions can be found @xcite . on the other hand , as was briefly discussed in @xcite , the situation is essentially more complicated when we are working in two - loop approximation .",
    "detail analysis shows that the investigation of the ir stability of the fixed point in the general case of the present model has to be done individually for concrete situation which is rather cumbersome and it must be done in a separate work .",
    "in present paper we have studied the influence of compressibility and helicity of the system on the possible ir scaling regimes of the model of a passive scalar advected by a gaussian velocity field with finite time correlations by means of the field theoretic rg technique .",
    "the dependence of the fixed points , which are directly related to the existence of possible ir scaling regimes , on the parameters of compressibility and helicity as well as their ir stability is discussed .",
    "the explicit inequalities , which define the stable ir scaling regimes , are found in the case of the frozen limit of the model .",
    "the most general case with finite time correlations of the velocity field is more complicated within two - loop approximation and has to be consider in detail once more .",
