    "a possible co - existence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity remains one of the most interesting problem in high-@xmath1 cuprates . despite that in several theoretical scenarios of high-@xmath1 superconductivity in cuprates",
    "the cooper - pairing arises due to an exchange of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations present in the paramagnetic phase @xcite , it is commonly believed that bulk superconductivity and the antiferromagnetism do not coexist in the cuprates at the same doping concentration and temperature .",
    "however , recently possible formation of antiferromagnetism below the superconducting transition temperature was found by several experimental techniques in underdoped yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 and la@xmath7sr@xmath6cuo@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the relatively small values of the observed magnetic moments @xcite ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bohr magneton ) have indicated an orbital rather than an electronic origin of the observed antiferromagnetism .",
    "interestingly , some of these findings were interpreted in terms of the time - reversal symmetry breaking state@xcite or @xmath11-density wave state @xcite that may occur in the underdoped cuprates below the pseudogap formation temperature , @xmath12 .",
    "most recently , the time - reversal symmetry breaking below @xmath12 has been indeed observed in underdoped bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath13 by means of the angle - resolved - photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .    real part of the ac - susceptibility of the oxiginated sample ( upper picture ) of the fluorinated sample ( lower picture ) .",

    "the superconducting transitions are relatively sharp and shows no further phases .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) can be one of the most powerful tools to study the possible occurrence of the intrinsic antiferromagnetism in high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductors .",
    "very recently the maximum in the transverse relaxation rate of cu(2 ) nuclei observed in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath14 below @xmath1 at t  =  35  k was interpreted in terms of critical fluctuations of the @xmath11-density wave state @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn from the analysis of the spin - freezing processes in underdoped y@xmath7ca@xmath6ba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath15 and la@xmath7sr@xmath6cuo@xmath8@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nqr study provides a more direct prove for the formation of orbital magnetism since it is performed in zero magnetic field .",
    "thus , the internal magnetic moments if they are present will result in the nqr line splitting .",
    "so far such a splitting was not observed in high-@xmath1 cuprates . instead , one mainly observes an anomalous broadened cu nqr spectra at low doping @xcite . associating the broad cu nqr spectra with doping inhomogeneities is leading to a few contradictions .",
    "the spectral width should depend on the preparation conditions and should have strongly decreased with improved preparation techniques developed in the past decade . especially for the case of hg - cuprates , that possess extremely broad nqr spectra ,",
    "a dependency of the width of the nqr spectra on preparation conditions has never been reported .",
    "the second and more relevant reason against a doped inhomogeneity as the origin of the broad cu nqr spectra is that it will spread the superconducting transition .",
    "an inhomogeneously distributed electric field gradient ( efg ) is directly associated to an inhomogeneously distributed charge density in the cuo layers .",
    "the charge density again is associated to the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "thus , a distribution of spheres with distinct efgs inside a crystal has to be associated to a distribution of @xmath16 s . if one estimates the distributions of @xmath16 s of hgbacuo from the phenomenological model by gippius et al .",
    "@xcite , the superconducting transition should be broadened by several tenth of k , what is clearly not the case .",
    "the most interesting reason for additional nqr lines is the removing of the kramers degeneracy of the cu quadrupole levels due to a formation of magnetic fields at the cu sites .",
    "such magnetic fields may arise from an antiferromagnetic state formatting spontaneously below @xmath1 .",
    "additional lines may also occur from impurities and cu outside the cuo layers .",
    "however , lines from impurities should be visible at any temperature .",
    "furthermore , the relaxation times of cu inside the cuo layers are extremely short , in comparison with metallic cu , and driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations ( af ) @xcite inside the cuo layers , strongly decreasing with distance .",
    "if a line from an impurity becomes visible at a certain temperature it can be easily identified by their distinct relaxation times with respect to cu inside cuo layers .    in this work using nqr technique we present the first experimental evidence for the formation of the internal magnetic moments in the optimally doped three - cuo@xmath4-layer hg@xmath17cu@xmath18ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath13 ( hg-1223 ) and hg@xmath17cu@xmath18ba@xmath4ca@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath13@xmath19 high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) below @xmath1 ( @xmath1 = 134  k ) .",
    "the synthesis of the samples is described in ref .",
    "an impurity content of less than 5  % within the sample was found from neutron powder diffraction and x - ray powder diffraction  @xcite .",
    "the real part of the ac - susceptibility is shown in fig  [ suscep ] .",
    "both samples possess different ways of preparation and types of dopands .",
    "thus , any common properties have to attributed to intrinsic properties of the superconducting state .",
    "in particular , we show that @xmath20cu nqr - lines split below @xmath1 due to a zeeman splitting originating from the internal magnetic fields within the cuo@xmath4-layers .",
    "our measurements were carried out on a home - built nqr spectrometer .",
    "the spectra have been recorded by point - by - point technique with a hahn spin - echo pulse sequence with pulse lengths of 4  @xmath21s and 8  @xmath21s .",
    "the recovery of the longitudinal magnetization was measured by the method of saturation recovery .",
    "various numbers of saturating pulses ( from 3 to 101 ) have been used to study the dependency of the spin - lattice relaxation on the initial conditions .",
    "the decay of the transverse magnetization was measured by varying the pulse separation ( @xmath22 ) of the spin - echo sequence . in order to detect lines with strongly different @xmath23 times",
    "the spectra were scanned with first increasing pulse separation time @xmath24 of the hahn echo sequence . to detect lines with strongly different @xmath25 times",
    "the point to be measured was saturating by a saturating comp and after a time @xmath26 measured by the hahn spin - echo sequence .",
    "nuclei with a spin @xmath27 possess a quadrupole moment and interacting with an efg .",
    "the efg is described by the traceless tensor @xmath28 .",
    "since the efg tensor is a traceless tensor , only the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 are needed to characterize the efg tensor .",
    "the efg tensor is commonly described by the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 defined by the equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in high-@xmath16 superconductors the elongated cuo octahedrons leading to the case of axial symmetry of the efg at the cu site , giving @xmath35 .    with the restriction to the case of axial symmetry of the efg tensor",
    ", the interaction energy is defined by the well known hamiltonian @xmath36 with eq the quadrupole moment of the nucleus .",
    "the eigenvalues of this unperturbed hamiltonian are @xmath37 in general , there is a twofold degeneracy of the @xmath38 eigenvalues corresponding to the symmetry of the nucleus charge distribution and of the efg . for half",
    "integer spins a deviation from the efgs rotational symmetry , @xmath39 , will not remove the degeneracy corresponding to kramers theorem that states that the degeneracy of half integer spins can only completely be removed by a magnetic field .    for the case of nuclei like cu with spin",
    "the set of levels form a virtual two level system due to the kramers degeneracy and only one transition will be observed .",
    "note , that for this particular case , an observed cu nqr line splitting can only be due to mesoscopic charge segregation and/or the appearance of a magnetic field at the nucleus site .",
    "the twofold degeneracy of the quadrupole level is corresponding to the fact , that turning the nuclei end for end will leave the electrostatic energy unchanged . applying a magnetic field at the nuclei",
    "will lower the symmetry of the system and lifting the degeneracy .",
    "in general the situation is described by adding a zeeman term @xmath41 to the unperturbed hamiltonian@xcite ( [ zeemann ham ] ) @xmath42 and treating the problem in first order perturbation theory .",
    "the solutions can be divided into three cases : the magnetic field @xmath43 oriented in parallel , second perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the efg , and third the magnetic field oriented with angles @xmath44 with respect to the symmetry axis of the efg . in the cases @xmath45 parallel to the symmetry axis , the mixing of the @xmath46 level vanishes and only two lines are observed . in the case",
    "@xmath45 perpendicular to the symmetry axis the splitting of the @xmath47 vanishes in first order and again two lines are observed . for case three",
    "the quadrupole levels split into four levels with a mixing of the @xmath46 levels and four lines are observed .",
    "the three different cases are corresponding to different orientations of the magnetic field direction with respect to the symmetry axis of the efg and can be distinguished by investigating the spin - lattice relaxation behavior under various initial conditions .",
    "in the simplest case , of a two level system , or a virtual two level system ( degenerated system ) , the concept of spin temperature can be applied to the problem and the establishing of equilibrium magnetization @xmath48 is described by the single exponential function @xmath49 .",
    "thus , a line splitting in coincidence with a single exponential spin - lattice recovery function characterizes a line splitting due to a mesoscopic charge segregation and the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the kramers degeneracy is left unchanged and every line in the spectrum corresponds to a transition between degenerated @xmath50 levels . in case of unequally spaced levels ( applied magnetic field ) the system will come into internal equilibrium and into equilibrium with the lattice with distinct time constants . furthermore , the recovery is not exponential and depend on the initial conditions i.e. the saturating time .",
    "in general , the recovery of the central transition of a four level system into equilibrium is described by a linear combination of three exponential functions @xmath51 whereas the @xmath52 depend on the relaxation mechanism and saturating time . in order to extract",
    "the correct recovery law one has to know the dominant relaxation mechanism . in some particular cases the recovery law for spin - lattice relaxation",
    "can be given and are well known in magnetic resonance . for quadrupole",
    "splitting and magnetic relaxation for example a @xmath53 nuclei like cu the recovery of the central transition after short saturation time is described by the recovery law    @xmath54    and @xmath55 for long saturating time @xcite .",
    "if magnetic and quadrupole relaxation are allowed no analytic solution can be given .",
    "the situation in nqr is slightly different since @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath47 , are excited , however , the general facts hold true that the spin - lattice relaxation is described by a multi exponential recovery law and that the component of the recovery    cu nqr spectra for the oxygenated sample at various temperatures ( circles ) .",
    "below @xmath1 the spectra are described by six pairs of lines ( solid curves ) indicating the splitting of the resonance frequencies .",
    "for comparison also normal - state data are displayed where only two pairs of lines are present.,width=245 ]    law with the longer relaxation time will increase with increasing saturating time . this characteristic behavior can be utilized to distinguish not only between a magnetic and electric line splitting . in case of a magnetic line splitting it",
    "can be utilized to distinguish between the various orientations of the magnetic to the symmetry axis of the efg tensor .    in case of the orientation of the magnetic field perpendicular to efg s symmetry axis the @xmath58 levels coincidence and the system consist of three levels .",
    "the relaxation is now described by two transitions between this three levels and thus , in general , described by a two exponential recovery law . in the two other cases the recovery law is , in general , described by a three exponential law .    in most cases",
    "the time constants of the recovery law are close to each other and the three distinct exponential functions can hardly be resolved . in such a case",
    "one can not distinguished a three exponential recovery law from a two exponential recovery law by a fitting procedure",
    ". however , three and two exponential recovery laws can be distinguish by their answers to various saturating times . in case of a two exponential recovery law varying the saturating time",
    "will only affect the coefficients of the individual exponential functions and not the time constants .",
    "if , however , a three exponential recovery trace is fitted with a two exponential recovery law , varying the saturating time will obtain different time constants for various saturating times .",
    "thus we safely conclude , that we can distinguish a line splitting due to a mesoscopic charge segregation and due to a removal of the kramers degeneracy , by recording the spin - lattice relaxation curve under different initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , in case of a removal of the kramers degeneracy the orientation of the magnetic with respect to the symmetry axis of the efg can be deduced from the spin - lattice relaxation curve .",
    "different initial conditions may established e. g. by using the method of saturation recovery and applying different numbers of saturation pulses . under the condition of mesoscopic charge segregation ,",
    "one expects a single exponential recovery independent of the number of saturating pulses .",
    "however , a removal of the kramers degeneracy is leading to a multi exponential recovery curve depending on the initial conditions .",

    "this seems to contradict the @xmath11-density wave scenario , since it is expected that the doping concentration of the holes in the inner and the outer cuo@xmath4-layers are different and the latter are more doped .",

    "<S> we report pure zero field nuclear magnetic resonance ( nqr ) measurements on the optimally doped three layer high-@xmath0-compounds hgbacacuo and hgbacacuo(f ) with @xmath1 134  k. above @xmath2 two cu </S>",
    "<S> nqr line pairs are observed in the spectra corresponding to the two inequivalent cu lattice sites . below @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the cu nqr spectra show additional lines leading to the extreme broadened cu nqr spectra at 4.2  k well known for the hgbacacuo compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - lattice relaxation curves follow a triple exponential function with coefficients depend onto the saturation time ( number of saturation pulses ) , whereas the spin - spin relaxation curve is described by a single exponential function . from the spin - lattice relaxation we deduced a complete removal of the kramers degeneracy of the cu quadrupole indicating that the additional lines are due to a zeemann splitting of the @xmath3cu lines due to the spontaneous formation of magnetic moments within the cuo layers . below 140  k , the spectra </S>",
    "<S> are well fitted by a number of 6 @xmath3cu line pairs . from the number of the cu lines , the position of the lines relative to each other and the complete removal of the kramers degeneracy we deduced an orientation of the magnetic moments parallel to the symmetry axis of the electric field gradient tensor with magnitudes of the order of 1000  g. we also discuss the possible microscopic origin of the observed internal magnetic fields . </S>"
