    "the second method uses the fundamental plane of black hole activity given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are the 5-ghz unbeamed core luminosity , 210-kev x - ray luminosity in erg  s@xmath2 , and black hole mass in @xmath4 , respectively , with a scatter of 0.88  dex in @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "this relationship was determined by using the samples of x - ray binaries , nearby low - luminosity agns , seyfert galaxies ( including seven nls1s ) , and quasars .",

    "these crucial differences can be interpreted as a doppler beaming effect only in cores .",
    "the some apparent discrepancies in @xmath116 between the two methods could be due to such factors as scatters on the empirical relations , luminosity variabilities , or the uncertainties of black hole masses .",
    "we estimated a core doppler factor of @xmath117 by comparing intrinsic and observed core luminosities , assuming that the core flux density is boosted by @xmath118 , where @xmath119 @xcite , and a flat ( @xmath120 ) spectrum if @xmath78 is not available for pmn  j0948 + 0022 @xcite , @xmath121 for fbqs  j1644 + 2619 @xcite , @xmath122 and @xmath123 for 1h  0323 + 342 and pks  0558@xmath124504 , respectively ( the captions in table  [ table2 ] ) . ] .",
    "subsequently , we can obtain the constraints of jet speed @xmath125 and viewing angle @xmath126 for each source ( table  [ table3 ] ) .",

    "the contrary , the black hole masses of most typical nls1s ( @xmath154 ) suggest below the threshold . in these systems , even if jets are emanated , hotspots would be disrupted into edge - darkened ( fr - i ) radio lobes , which may tend to go undetected in the limited image sensitivity of first @xcite , as is the case with the discovery of fr - i morphology in the radio - quiet quasar e1821 + 643 exclusively in a deep vla image @xcite .",
    "the lower detection rate is not due to an observational limitation specific to nls1s because the control sample of bls1s was also investigated using first images ( section  [ section : fractionofnls1rg ] ) and shares the same difficulty in detection of fr - i morphology . _ therefore , lower maximal jet kinetic powers due to lower - mass black holes may be related to the lower detection rate of the extended radio structures in the nls1 population compared with those in the broad - line agns_. the radio emissions in most typical ( radio - quiet ) nls1s are compact @xcite and are dominated by diffuse components confined within central regions in vlbi images ( @xcite ; doi  et  al .  in  prep . ) , which may be relevant to the link between apparent radio size and black hole mass .",
    "furthermore , the link between the radio size and eddington ratio may also be a contributor , since only a small fraction of accretion luminosity is expected to be transferred to jet power in high eddington ratio systems such as nls1s , according to the nonlinearity in an empirical relation that is observed in radio galaxies : @xmath155 @xcite .",

    "first , the adopted threshold of @xmath136 was based on tentative values of jet kinetic power and ambient density .",
    "to clarify the fr - i / ii dichotomy in kpc - scale radio structures of nls1s , a study of dynamical interaction between the radio lobe and cocoon is crucial @xcite and will be explored in future research .",
    "second , an alternative possibility is that the apparent compact structures in most cases even for radio - loud nls1s is attributed to short - lived radio sources of @xmath189  pc ( @xmath190  years ) .",
    "vlbi images have been obtained for several compact radio - loud nls1s , including rx  j0806.6 + 7248 , fbqs  j1629 + 4007 , rx  j1633.3 + 4718 , b3  1702 + 457 @xcite , pks  1502 + 036 @xcite , and sbs  0846 + 513 @xcite .",
    "however , no clear evidence of young radio lobes has yet been detected in pc scales ( cf .",
    "@xcite proposed the nls1compact steep - spectrum  ( css ) connection on the radio - loud nls1 pks  2004@xmath124447 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "third , the estimation of black masses through the virial relationship is controversial .",
    "the impact of this factor on our study is discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the virial mass estimation is subject to the assumption of an isotropic geometry of a broad - line region  ( blr ) with random orbital inclination of clouds that are gravitationally bound to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the virial assumption could be violated in sources with high eddington ratios because the outward force due to radiation pressure overcomes or compensates for gravitational attraction ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mass deficit due to this effect indicates that bls1s with high eddington ratios would be preferentially misclassified into nls1s .",
    "however , such a situation may be inconsistent with the observed lower detection rate of extended radio emissions in nls1s ( section  [ section : fractionofnls1rg ] ) because large jet kinetic powers can generally be expected from such highly mass - accreting systems with larger black hole masses .",
    "if the geometry of blr is flat , a small line width would be the result of a small inclination and the mass would be underestimated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , planar blrs in blazars have been suggested ( @xcite and references therein , but see @xcite ) .",
    "the mass deficit due to this effect indicates that bls1s viewed face - on would be preferentially misclassified into nls1s .",
    "however , such a situation may be inconsistent with the observed lower fraction of radio - loud objects in nls1s compared with bls1s @xcite in the framework of the doppler - beaming effect .",
    "that is , _ these two possible mechanisms for inducing mass deficit do not manifest in the actual radio views of nls1s as a population_. small masses have been presumed for nls1s as a class on the basis of several other methods , e.g. , an accretion - disk model fit ( by fitting the spectral energy distributions with the disk and corona model ; @xcite ) and the analysis of x - ray variability power density spectra @xcite .    from the perspective of the present study ,",
    "the planar blr may influence individual objects of nls1s with unusually high core dominances in particular , which indicate very small viewing angles ( section  [ section : coredominance ] ) .",
    "the black hole masses of these blazar - like nls1s ( @xmath7  m@xmath14 in a virial method ) might be underestimated : their true masses may be even larger ( @xmath191  m@xmath14 ) .",
    "if this is the case , _ our conclusion that nls1s with kpc - scale radio structures have relatively large black hole masses remains_. we note the existence of non - beamed radio - loud nls1s that may be inclined , which include the lobe - dominated nls1 with @xmath192  m@xmath14 ( section  [ section : newdetection ] ) and several steep - spectrum radio sources in radio - loud nls1s @xcite ; intrinsic radio and optical natures are observed in these sources .",

    "we define the kinematic age as @xmath193 , where @xmath156 is the deprojected size at kpc scales assuming the same viewing angle as that at the core region ( @xmath126 ) . assuming @xmath1940.3 at kpc scales [ column  ( 7 ) in table  [ table3 ] ] as constant speeds of advance , jet activity should be maintained for @xmath7  years to build the entire radio structures [ column  ( 8) in table  [ table3 ] ] . for and",
    ", strong constraints on @xmath195 can not be obtained because the upper limits of @xmath157 are not available from their coreless and one - sided jet structures , respectively .    in comparison with galactic black holes (",
    "* for a review ) , the accretion disks of nls1s with kpc - scale radio structures could be in a very high state , which is a transitional state at very high accretion rates between low / hard and high / soft states , characterized by powerful transient relativistic ejections @xcite .",
    "the derived kinematic ages of @xmath7  years for these nls1s may imply the sustenance ability of the very high state on the internal secular evolution of black holes in nls1 hosts @xcite .",
    "nls1s are considered to be in a super - eddington accretion state and are believed to have slim disks as optically thick advection - dominated accretion flows @xcite .",
    "black hole masses are expected to increase exponentially by factors of @xmath130 and @xmath196 in case of super - eddington mass accretion , and we assume that @xmath197 , where @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 are the eddington luminosity , mass - energy conversion efficiency , and eddington mass accretion rate , respectively . ] at @xmath201 for durations of @xmath202  years and @xmath203  years , respectively @xcite .",
    "these arguments suggest that the lifetime of an nls1 with relativistic ejections is limited to @xmath9  years . from the perspective of the fraction of nls1s ( @xmath130% ) in the agn population",
    "as well , @xmath9  years in nls1 phase is suggested from the agn lifetime of @xmath204  years @xcite .",
    "however , large - scale radio morphology would be detectable in radio sources with ages of @xmath7  years after their black holes have grown to @xmath205  @xmath4 ( section  [ section : escape - to - kpc ] ) , in which the population of broad - line agns is dominant ( figure  [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "hence , kpc - scale radio structures may originate in a small window of opportunity during the final stage of the nls1 phase just before altering into broad - line agns .",
    "_ thus , the lower detection rate of kpc - scale radio structures can be attributed to the short lifetime _ in addition to lower maximal jet kinetic powers due to lower - mass black holes ( section  [ section : escape - to - kpc ] ) .",

    "the detection rate of extended radio emission in nls1s is lower than that in broad - line agns with a statistical significance of 5% ( section  [ section : fractionofnls1rg ] ) . *",
    "four of the six nls1s ( , , , and ) exhibit two - sided radio structures in kpc scales , one - sided jet morphology in pc scales ( sections  [ section : advancingspeed ] ) , and unusually high core dominances , as observed in most blazers .",
