    "in normal mesoscopic multiterminal conductors , the cross correlation between currents flowing into different terminals are manifestly negative . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is a consequence of the fermionic statistics of the electrons . recently ,",
    "such negative correlations were observed experimentally @xcite , in an electrical analog @xcite of the hanbury brown twiss experiment @xcite with photons .",
    "the manifestly negative cross correlations were derived under the assumption of noninteracting electrons .",
    "in contrast , long range coulomb interactions between electrons can give rise to positive cross correlations between currents at capacitive contacts @xcite .",
    "moreover , in ref . @xcite it is demonstrated that for inelastic scattering between edge states in a multiterminal conductor in the quantum hall regime , the current cross correlation can be positive .",
    "another situation where positive cross correlations are possible is when the normal conductor is connected to a superconducting reservoir @xcite .    in a normal - superconducting system",
    ", electrons can be converted into holes via andreev reflection at the interface between the normal conductor and the superconductor .",
    "the andreev reflection thus introduces correlations between electrons and holes in the normal conductor , a phenomena known as the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "the influence of the proximity effect on the current auto - correlations , i.e. the shot noise , in two - terminal normal - superconductor junctions has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in multiterminal conductors ,",
    "andreev reflection can lead to positive cross correlations between currents flowing in the contacts to the normal reservoirs @xcite .",
    "this was originally predicted for single mode conductors @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a discussion of a very asymmetrical geometry in which one of the contacts is a tunneling tip suggested negative correlations in the presence of channel - mixing scattering @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in ref . @xcite it was shown that in a multiterminal diffusive normal - superconducting system with perfect interfaces between the normal conductor and superconducting reservoir , the cross correlations are manifestly negative in the absence of the proximity effect .",
    "positive correlations can be enforced with the help of ferromagnetic contacts @xcite a case which we will not discuss here further .    clearly , these very different predictions and their sensitivity to the specific choice of parameters and geometry demand a more systematic investigation of the role of channel - mixing and the proximity effect . to investigate the role of channel mixing boerlin et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed a geometry with diffusive tunnel junctions .",
    "independently , the authors @xcite present a systematic analysis of the current correlations in a system consisting of a chaotic quantum dot connected via point contacts to one superconducting and two normal reservoirs . using the scattering approach for normal - superconducting systems @xcite in combination with a random matrix theory @xcite description of the chaotic dot",
    "has the advantage of allowing us to analyze both the case with and without proximity effect on the same footing .",
    "generic _ properties of the model also makes our results qualitatively relevant for multiterminal normal - superconducting structures with random scattering .",
    "the three terminal dot - superconductor junction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a chaotic quantum dot ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definition ) is connected to two normal reservoirs ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and one superconducting reservoir ( @xmath2 ) via quantum point contacts .",
    "the contact to the normal reservoir is perfect , the contact to the superconducting reservoir has a mode independent transparency @xmath3 .",
    "the contacts support @xmath4 and @xmath5 transverse modes respectively .",
    "the conductance of the point contacts are much larger than the conductance quanta @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 , so coulomb blockade effects in the dot can be neglected .",
    "the two normal reservoirs are held at the same potential @xmath8 and the potential of the superconducting reservoir is zero .",
    "the magnetic flux in the dot is @xmath9 .",
    "due to the random scattering in the dot , the current @xmath10 in contact @xmath11 fluctuates around its quantum statistical average @xmath12 .",
    "we calculate the zero - frequency spectral density of the current cross - correlations @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the correlation @xmath15 can be expressed @xcite in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath2 of the total system , dot and superconductor .",
    "to proceed @xmath2 can be expressed @xcite in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath16 of the dot and the andreev reflection amplitude at the contact - superconductor interface .",
    "we consider the limit of zero temperature and a potential @xmath17 much lower than the inverse dwell time of the dot , @xmath18 , where the energy dependence of the scattering matrix @xmath16 can be neglected .",
    "we also assume @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the superconducting gap .",
    "this restricts the transport to an energy interval where no quasiparticles can escape into the superconductor . in this regime",
    ", the scattering matrix @xmath2 describes only scattering between the normal reservoirs .    noting that the current fluctuation is just the sum of the fluctuations of electron and hole currents , the noise power can be conveniently written @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath24 quasiparticle currents . unlike the cross correlations in purely normal systems @xcite , which are manifestly negative",
    ", the cross - correlation @xmath15 can be positive , because the correlations between different types of quasiparticles , @xmath25 , are positive .",
    "the ensemble averaged correlations @xmath26 are calculated using the statistical properties of the scattering matrix @xmath16 of the dot @xcite .",
    "the details of these calculations are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , here we just show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for various transparencies @xmath3 of the dot - superconductor contact .",
    "two different regimes for the magnetic flux are considered . for a flux much smaller than the flux quanta , @xmath27",
    ", the magnetic flux has no effect on the proximity effect and can be completely neglected . in the opposite regime , a magnetic flux larger than the flux quantum , @xmath28 , effectively breaks the time reversal symmetry in the dot and suppresses the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that suppressing the proximity effect has a very different effect in the two limits ; dominating coupling of the dot to the normal reservoirs , @xmath29 , and to the superconducting reservoir @xmath30 . in the limit of strong coupling to the superconducting reservoir , @xmath30 ,",
    "suppressing the proximity effect with a magnetic flux in the dot completely suppresses the positive correlations .    in this limit , in the presence of the proximity effect",
    ", there is a gap in the spectrum around the fermi energy in the dot @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "quasiparticles injected from one normal reservoir are andreev reflected , effectively direct at the contact - dot interface @xcite , with unity probability back to the same reservoir .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for a perfect contact to the superconducting reservoir , @xmath31 , however , the scattering probabilities ( as a function of @xmath32 ) are essentially independent of @xmath3 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the scattering process is thus deterministic , there is no partition of incoming quasiparticles and hence no noise , @xmath34 .",
    "increasing the coupling to the normal reservoir , the probability of normal reflection as well as cross andreev reflection , from one reservoir to the other , becomes finite . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the normal reflection is the dominant process of the two . on a formal level , we can thus neglect the terms in @xmath15 containing the cross andreev reflection amplitude . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , this gives @xmath35 , positive since only terms in @xmath36 contribute . here",
    "@xmath37 .    suppressing the proximity effect ,",
    "the gap in the spectrum is suppressed and the scattering processes are strongly modified .",
    "this is clearly seen by comparing the two figures in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , showing the scattering probabilities for @xmath31 . in the limit of @xmath38 ,",
    "an injected electron , which in the presence of the proximity effect was directly back reflected as hole with unity probability to the same contact , now has a probability @xmath39 each to leave the dot in the following four ways : as an electron into contact 1 or 2 or a hole into contact 1 or 2 .    as a consequence ,",
    "the correlations become negative , i.e. there are no positive correlations in the absence of the proximity effect , similar to what was found for a metallic diffusive system @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] demonstrates that this is independent on the transparency @xmath3 of the barrier in the dot - superconductor contact .    in the opposite limit , with a weak coupling of the dot to the superconductor , @xmath40",
    ", the cross correlations are independent of the proximity effect , as seen in fig .",
    "this is also observed for the different scattering probabilities in fig .",
    "an analytical calculation of the correlations in this limit gives the simple result @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the andreev reflection probability of quasiparticles incident in the dot - superconductor contact .",
    "there is a crossover from negative to positive correlations , which occurs for @xmath43 , i.e @xmath44 . in this limit of weak coupling to the superconducting reservoir , where the proximity effect plays no role , it is possible to explain the current correlations with straightforward particle counting arguments .",
    "in the limit of weak coupling to the superconductor , a quasiparticle injected from one of the normal reservoir will at the most scatter once at the contact between the dot and the superconductor ( with a probability @xmath45 to andreev reflect ) , before leaving the dot . noting that an andreev reflection at the dot - superconducting interface effectively leads to an injection of a pair of particles ( electrons or holes )",
    ", we can equivalently say that in the limit of weak coupling to the superconductor , none of the particles in such an injected pair will ever return to the dot - superconductor contact , but instead directly and independently leave the dot into one of the normal reservoirs , with probability @xmath46 for each reservoir .",
    "this process is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    based on this ,",
    "we can , using particle counting statistics arguments , calculate the probability @xmath47 that @xmath48 electrons have ended up in the normal reservoir @xmath49 , when @xmath50 pairs have tried to enter the dot . from the probability @xmath47",
    ", we can calculate ( the details are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the cross correlations , giving @xmath51 this is just the same as was found in eq . ( [ notrssmallar ] ) , using a completely quantum mechanical approach .    as a comparison , considering the injection of single particles",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , corresponding to the situation when the superconducting reservoir is replaced by a normal reservoir , we instead get manifestly negative cross correlations .    from this",
    "we can conclude that in the limit of a weak coupling to the superconductor , the current correlations are determined by the andreev reflection at the dot - superconductor interface together with independent partitioning of particles inside the dot .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the relation between current cross correlations and the proximity effect in a three terminal chaotic - dot superconductor junction .",
    "we find that both the sign and magnitude of the correlations can be changed by a weak magnetic field in the dot , suppressing the proximity effect . in the limit of weak coupling of the dot to the superconducting reservoir",
    ", the current correlation can be found by particle counting arguments .",
