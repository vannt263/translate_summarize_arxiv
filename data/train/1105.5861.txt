    "generation 4 g wireless communication systems are required to support all - ip services including high data rate multimedia traffic @xcite , with bit rate targets as high as @xmath0 gbit / s for low mobility , and @xmath1 mbit / s for high mobility @xcite .",
    "transmission at such high rates is certainly achievable today on point - to - point links , using the great advances made in wireless communications over the past couple of decades .",
    "but in wireless networks , including 4 g systems , interference between links remains as a fundamental bottleneck that needs to be overcome @xcite .",
    "part of the challenge arises from the broadcast nature of the shared wireless medium : transmission power has to be allocated to each link , but this allocation has knock - on effects on other links in the network .",
    "much progress has been made on this problem when target rates are specified for each user and the objective is to minimize total transmit power in the network @xcite .",
    "however , solving for optimum power allocations that maximize the total shannon - theoretic sum - rate in the presence of interfering links seems to be much harder : it is generally a _ non - linear _ , _ non - convex _ constrained optimization problem @xcite .",
    "this motivates a search for structure leading to simplifications in the power allocation problem for sum - rate maximization .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the optimum allocation of transmission powers to mobile terminals in order to maximize the total communication sum - rate when a low - complexity single - user decoder ( without successive decoding ) is used at the base station .",
    "this is the conventional single cell matched filter detection based uplink model : all mobiles are in the same cell and must all be decoded at the same base station . even though this optimization problem is non - convex ,",
    "we solve it by identifying an underlying _ schur - convex _ structure in the objective sum - rate function .",
    "we show that the optimum power allocation is _ binary _ , _",
    "i.e. , _ a user either transmits with full power or does not transmit at all . by utilizing the binary structure of the sum - rate maximizing optimum power allocation ,",
    "we observe two dominant modes of communication : either the best user transmits with full power , which can be considered a channel quality based time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) mode , or all users transmit with full power , which can be considered a wideband ( wb ) mode .",
    "this result has implications for implementing joint power - control and scheduling , and helps to theoretically justify existing engineering approaches , such as code - division - multiple - access ( cdma ) , and scheduling based on channel quality .",
    "we also compare sum - rates achieved by the optimum power - control policy with throughput capacity limits that can be achieved by successive decoding .",
    "our results indicate that gains over the simple optimum binary power - control due to advanced interference cancellation techniques can be harvested only if the cancellation efficiency is near - perfect .",
    "in this paper , we are motivated by recent work on interference networks that shows that binary power - control is often close to optimal when interference is treated as gaussian noise , links have maximum ( peak ) power constraints , and the objective is to maximize the sum - rate , even if it is not necessarily optimal in general @xcite .",
    "`` binary '' here just means that a link is either `` on '' or `` off '' , either at zero power , or maximum power , without taking any value in the continuum of possible values between @xmath2 and the peak power level .",
    "in addition to @xcite , some other works such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite also motivate us to investigate the optimality of binary power - control .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite consider jointly optimal allocation of rates and transmission powers in cdma networks under alternative objectives such as maximization of the sum of signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratios ( @xmath3 ) @xcite and the packet success probability @xcite .",
    "both approaches convert the problem into a convex optimization problem , and show that the optimum power - control is indeed binary under such approximations . in @xcite , the authors proved the optimality of an _ almost _ binary power - control strategy , up to one exceptional transmission power level in the continuum between @xmath2 and the peak power level , maximizing the total uplink communication rate .",
    "the results reported in @xcite as well as in other works raise the further question : when is `` binary '' power - control exactly optimal ? it has been shown in very recent work @xcite that binary power - control is optimal when there is total symmetry amongst the links , _",
    "i.e. , _ all direct link gains have one particular value , and all the cross - link gains have another particular value ( possibly the same value as the direct link gain , but not necessarily ) . one interesting feature of the result is that it is _ as if _ the sum - rate function of the powers were either schur - convex , or schur - concave ( even though it is neither ) , leading to the observed result that either all links should be `` on '' or just one link should be `` on '' at the optimal solution .",
    "a two - link schur - convex / schur - concave structure is observed and used , but it does not generalize to more than two links .    in the present paper , we study the sum - rate maximization problem for the classical multiple access channel , where all the links terminate in a common receiver node , but the link gains can be arbitrary . in this setting , we show that the power - control problem can be solved quite easily via an underlying schur - convex structure .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric network of interfering links , it is no longer necessarily an all - or - one result : it is possible for the chosen set of links that are `` on '' to be larger than a singleton , but smaller than the set of all users , but it always consists of users with the best channels . on the other hand , we will observe from numerical results that the dominant modes , in terms of probability , correspond to the all - on or one - on solutions .",
    "majorization theory and schur - convex / concave structures were also successfully utilized in some previous works , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , to answer important questions in communications theory .",
    "this paper is another successful application of majorization theory to prove the optimality of binary power - control .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors focus on the transceiver design for point - to - point multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) communication systems . by using extra degrees of freedoms provided by multiple transmitter and receiver antennas , and assuming either minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) receiver or zero - forcing receiver ,",
    "they show that the optimum linear precoder at the transmitter is the one diagonilazing the channels ( _ i.e. , _ independent noise at all channels and no interference among them ) when the cost function to be minimized is schur - concave ( or , the objective function to be maximized is schur - convex ) . their results do not directly apply to the our problem since we consider the sum - rate maximization in the presence of interfering links in this paper .",
    "in fact , we solve a special case of an open problem posed in @xcite in chapter 5 on the optimum design of transceivers for the mimo multiple - access channel .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors focus on the design of capacity achieving spreading code sequences for the cdma multiple - access channel without fading .",
    "they allow multi - user detection for joint processing of users .",
    "even though the performance figure of merit we are interested in this paper is also related to the information capacity , our problem set - up is different than the set - up in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we look at the capacity achieving transmission power allocations , rather than the optimum spreading code sequence design , for fading gaussian channels in the presence of interfering links .",
    "for example , our objective sum - rate function is schur - convex whereas it is schur - concave in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors extend the analysis in @xcite to the case of colored noise .",
    "in @xcite , they analyze the _ user capacity _ , which is defined as the maximum number of users that can be admitted to the system by allocating spreading code sequences and transmission powers optimally without violating minimum @xmath3 requirements , of cdma systems . in this work ,",
    "we focus on achieveable sum - rates rather than on user capacity .",
    "our results are different from the corresponding classic results in @xcite . in @xcite , the maximum shannon - theoretic sum - rate",
    "is considered , whereas in the present paper , we treat interference as pure gaussian noise .",
    "although our assumption simplifies the receiver , it complicates the power optimization problem .",
    "we note that the capacity region of the gaussian multiple - access channel is well understood , and it is known that all points of the boundary of the rate region can be achieved by successive decoding @xcite .",
    "the optimal power - control for the fading gaussian multiple - access channel with channel state information at the transmitters is also well understood @xcite . in the present paper , we arrive at the problem from a different angle , where our interest is in understanding the structure of power - control problems in which interference is treated as gaussian noise ( very relevant for general interference networks ) , which excludes successive decoding or other multi - user decoding techniques .    from a practical perspective , treating interference as gaussian noise is the approach taken in most existing systems , including cellular systems .",
    "note that the uplink of a cell is indeed a multiple - access channel .",
    "successive decoding is more complex to implement , and suffers from error propagation , which is mainly a problem if channels can not be estimated very reliably .",
    "we note that qualcomm has recently produced a chip for successive decoding @xcite , so we can not be sure that successive decoding will not be used in practice .",
    "indeed , we believe it will be . in the present paper , we provide a comparison between the performance of the optimum binary power - control scheme with that of successive decoding , under various assumptions about the efficiency of the cancellation process .",
    "we expect that , in practice , successive decoding will be combined with user scheduling , to reduce the potential for error propagation , and the present paper provides insight into the problem of combined power - control and user scheduling , as will be shown .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the network model and some basic concepts from the theory of majorization .",
    "we focus on the uplink communication scenario where @xmath4 mobile users communicate with a single base station . at time - slot @xmath5",
    ", the received signal at the base station is given by the baseband discrete - time gaussian multiple - access channel as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the transmitted signal and the channel fading coefficient of the @xmath9 user , respectively , and @xmath10 is white gaussian noise with variance @xmath11 at the base station .",

    "this observation together with the schur - convexity of @xmath69 will be the key for characterizing the optimum power allocation vectors .",

    ", there must exist at least one user transmitting with positive power , and if there is only one user transmitting with positive power , this user must transmit with full power .",
    "it also directly follows from the schur - convexity of @xmath69 that if there are more than one users transmitting with positive power , one of them must transmit with full power .",

    "we now address the issue of uniqueness .",

    "note that this definition extends the model to allow fading , and we can consider @xmath75 as providing a power control policy , adaptive to changing channel conditions .",
    "then the following theorem provides uniqueness .",
    "[ thm : optimum power control 2 ] any optimal power - control policy @xmath76 assigns the channel to the best users for almost all fading states . if the stationary distribution of the fading process is absolutely continuous , then @xmath76 is unique up to a set of measure zero .",
    "see see appendix [ app : proof of uniqueness ] .",
    "we note that the set of optimum power allocation vectors solving ( [ eqn : problem 1 ] ) is not necessarily a singleton .",
    "however , theorem @xmath77 establishes uniqueness if the channel state vector is generated by an absolutely continuous distribution , which is a valid assumption for most practical systems .",
    "therefore , when we refer to an optimum power allocation vector or power - control policy for the rest of the paper , we will use @xmath78-notation without any ambiguity .    finally , it is important to consider what the constraint in means in the case of a fading channel .",
    "we can interpret this constraint as a _ peak _ power constraint .",
    "if @xmath12 were an average power constraint on the powers modulating gaussian codebooks @xcite , then we would replace the constraint that @xmath79 with the less onerous constraint that @xmath80 \\preceq p { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{1}}}$ ] .",
    "the reason for interest in peak power constraints is that in practice it is necessary to operate within the linear range of a power amplifier , and this may preclude bursts of power that may be required if only the average power is constrained .      in this section , we provide a polynomial - time algorithm for finding the optimum power allocation vector @xmath76 for a given channel state vector @xmath23 .",
    "one of the consequences of the structure of the optimum power - control policy established above is that it is piecewise constant : there exists a partition of the fading state space into @xmath81 regions upon each of which the optimum power - control policy is constant : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a transmission power profile such that @xmath84 , and the @xmath85 is the region on which only the users in @xmath86 transmit with full power , and the rest are not scheduled for transmission . even though it is possible to give exact characterizations of these optimum power - control regions when there are",
    "only a few users ( e.g. , see the two - user example in section [ section : tdma ] ) , it becomes prohibitively complex to determine them when there are many users .",
    "on the other hand , the structure of the optimum binary power allocation established above allows us to construct a simple , polynomial - time algorithm to compute the optimum power profile for any realized fading state and any number of users in the cell , which can be hard - coded into a scheduler circuit , without the need for any explicit characterization of the optimum power - control regions .",
    "the suggested algorithm takes a fading state @xmath23 as an input , computes the sum - rates @xmath87 at which the best @xmath88 , @xmath89 , users transmit with full power , and returns the optimum sum - rate maximizing transmission power profile at which only the best @xmath90 users are scheduled for transmission with full power .",
    "the pseudocode for this simple polynomial - time algorithm is shown below .",

    "in this section , we will establish the conditions under which the channel - state aware tdma policy , in which the channel is allocated to the best user , is optimal for maximizing sum - rate in single cell wireless communication systems .",
    "optimality of this tdma policy was established ( under symmetric fading distributions ) in previous works such as @xcite and @xcite when even successive decoding for interference cancellation is allowed , and users are subject to an _ average _ power constraint . on the other hand , as theorems [ thm : optimum power control 1 ] and [ thm : optimum power control 2 ] suggest , this tdma policy is not always optimal in the communication scenario considered in this paper where successive decoding is not allowed , and users are subject to peak power constraints .",
    "the following two - user example further illustrates this point quantitively .",
    "[ example : two user ] when there are two users in the system , the sum - rate maximizing power allocation @xmath98 is either @xmath99 , @xmath100 , or @xmath101 for any given fading state @xmath102 by theorem  [ thm : optimum power control 2 ] . writing down the aggregate communication rate expressions for all three cases separately , and comparing them , one can derive the following conditions for the optimal power allocation for the two - user communication scenario : @xmath103    these three optimum power allocation regions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : two - user policy ] . for any fading state @xmath23 lying inside the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : two - user policy ] , the tdma policy becomes suboptimal , and the sum - rate is maximized by allocating the full transmission power to both users .",
    "this situation occurs when both users experience similar and severe channel conditions , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the channel conditions experienced by users are relatively different from each other , or any of them is good enough , _",
    "@xmath105 , then the tdma policy maximizes the sum - rate .",
    "note that the shaded region on which the tdma policy is suboptimal shrinks to a point in the high @xmath21 regime when @xmath106 grows to infinity .",
    "therefore , in the high @xmath21 regime , we see one mode of communication with very high probability : only the best user transmits with full power . on the other hand , in the low @xmath21 regime where @xmath106 goes to zero , the shaded region grows and covers the whole positive orthant in the @xmath107-plane .",
    "therefore , in the low @xmath21 regime , we again see only one mode of communication with very high probability : all users transmit with full power .    when there are more than just two users , and for moderate @xmath21 values , other modes of communication in which the best @xmath88 , @xmath108 , users transmit with full power can arise",
    ". roughly speaking , the present discussion implies that the performance loss arising from the use of the tdma policy for scheduling the best user critically depends on the relative strength of the peak transmission power with respect to the total noise power , including the background noise and other - cell interference , present in the system .",
    "these observations will be the guiding principles for the proof of the optimality of the tdma policy in the next theorem , and they will be further supported through numerical results in section [ section : simulations ] .",
    "figure [ fig : two - user policy ] also illustrates why @xmath78 is unique when the fading process has a continuous distribution . when @xmath23 lies on the boundary where any two of these three regions intersect , there are more than one power profile maximizing the sum - rate . for example , all three power profiles @xmath109 and @xmath101 perform equally well for sum - rate maximization at the point @xmath110 .",

    "thus , there is no need for user scheduling when considering successive decoding under peak power constraints , and perfect channel state information at the base station .",
    "however , in practical implementations , @xmath136 is usually bounded away from one due to imperfect channel and signal estimations . in these cases",
    ", it may pay to do some user selection , but in the numerical results below , we assume that all users are scheduled for successive interference cancellation , as in .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : sic05 ] , [ fig : sic1 ] , [ fig : sic5 ] and [ fig : sic10 ] , we depict the sum - rates achieved by the optimum power - control policy and the throughput capacity limits achieved through successive decoding",
    ". as it must , the perfect successive signal decoding capability increases the rates of communication that can be achieved in single cell communication systems .",
    "in particular , for high density networks with moderate @xmath21 values , the performance increase achieved by the perfect successive decoding can be as much as two times the average sum - rate achieved by the optimal binary power - control treating all signals as noise .",
    "on the other hand , if the interference cancellation is not perfect and some residual signal power remains after each cancellation step , the sum - rate achieved by successive decoding saturates as @xmath21 increases , and the optimum binary power - control can achieve higher communication rates .",
    "therefore , practical successive interference cancellations at the chip level ( e.g. , qualcomm csm6850 ) require near - perfect cancellation efficiency to harvest potential gains due to complex successive decoding process .    in its favour , successive decoding",
    "does provide more fairness to users , as it enables all users to transmit and achieve sustainable data rates simultaneously .",

    "this paper exploits the schur - convexity property of the sum - rate function of received powers , to show that binary power - control is optimal for the multiple - access channel , when interference is treated as gaussian noise , and there are peak power constraints on the users .",
    "if the fading distribution is absolutely continuous , then the optimum binary power - control policy is unique .",
    "we provide an algorithm to find the optimum power allocation , as a function of the channel state , that is polynomial in the number of users in the cell . however , we also present numerical results for a realistically dimensioned single cell system which suggest that there is essentially no loss in restricting attention to the best of two possible allocations in each channel state : ( i ) the best user transmits at peak power with other users switched off , as in channel - state aware tdma , ( ii ) all users transmit simultaneously at peak power .",
    "this drastically reduces the complexity of the power allocation problem . finally , we compared all such schemes with successive decoding .",
    "our main conclusions regarding successive decoding are that as far as sum - rate maximization is concerned , successive decoding can gain up to about a factor of 2 over the optimal binary power - control scheme for the single cell model considered in the present paper , provided that the interference cancellation is perfect , and the snr is moderate ( not high or low ) . however ,",
    "at high or low snr , the gain is much less than that , and if the cancellation efficiency is less than 1 ( _ i.e. , _ some small fraction of the interference remains ) then the optimum binary power - control approach is superior , as it is not interference limited .",
    "it must be noted that this analysis pertains to only a single cell system , and to sum - rate maximization under peak power constraints . with multiple cells , and different objectives ( such as maximization of logarithmic utilities ) the conclusions are likely to be very different .",

    "we can achieve the same aggregate communication rate by setting the transmission power of the @xmath9 user to @xmath186 and that of the @xmath187 user to zero .",
    "however , such a transmission power allocation can be strictly dominated by a binary transmission power allocation as proven above .",
    "therefore , users transmitting with full power correspond to the ones with the best channel states when transmission powers are allocated according to @xmath72 .      binary structure of @xmath76 directly follows from theorem [ thm : optimum power control 1 ] and some measure theoretic arguments .",

    "to this end , it is enough to show that @xmath86 has zero volume since the stationary fading distribution is absolutely continuous .",
    "suppose not .",
    "then , we can find @xmath190 such that @xmath191 has positive volume .",

    "one can show that this can not happen by taking the partial derivative of @xmath199 with respect to @xmath201 .",

    "a similar problem was addressed in @xcite but for a different model : the symmetric network of interfering links .",
    "this is a model in which there are @xmath4 links , each with a different receiver node , and each link interferes with all the others .",
    "the symmetry refers to the fact that the direct link gain is unity for all links , and the cross - link gain is @xmath220 between any pair of links .",
    "see figure 1 in @xcite for an illustration of this model . in @xcite the received power",
    "is denoted by @xmath221 but if we replace that by @xmath222 then the sum - rate in this model , with @xmath4 links on , is given by @xmath223 note that if @xmath224 then this gives the same rate as @xmath4 links on in the model of the present appendix , under fading state @xmath215 , and indeed the symmetric network model degenerates into , effectively , a symmetric multiple access model in the special case @xmath224 .",
    "we can use results from @xcite , section iv b , to obtain the condition on @xmath213 that we need .",
    "section iv b examines the special case of binary power control in which a link is either on at full power or switched right off .",
    "first , it is shown that @xmath225 is a decreasing function of @xmath226 , and it crosses the constant value @xmath227 at a unique value of @xmath226 , namely , @xmath228 ( see ( 36 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath229 , then having one link on beats having @xmath4 links on .",
    "further , it is shown in lemma 4.3 in @xcite that @xmath230 increases in @xmath4 , and approaches a limiting value of @xmath231 as @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "thus , if @xmath232 , having one link on must be optimal in the class of binary power control schemes .    if we can show that @xmath233 then it will follow that having one link on is optimal in our multiple access model under fading @xmath215 .",
    "but if @xmath234 then indeed @xmath233 , so we conclude that a sufficient condition for scheduling just the best link is @xmath234 , as stated in the theorem",
