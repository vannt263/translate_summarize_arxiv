    "recent methodologies from physics have been successfully applied to the study of economy and financial markets complexity .",
    "this new area of research is called econophysics .",
    "the econophysics community is currently doing active research in topics such as the study of the distributional properties of the variations of the stock market , network analysis of economical phenomena , financial crashes , wealth distributions , study of financial markets under a microscopic point of view , etc . about the latter , it involves techniques named microscopic simulation ( ms ) @xcite , that consists of the study of a complex system by individually following on a computer each agent of the system and its interactions with the other agents , and simulating the overall system evolution .",
    "this technique is becoming very promising and useful . following this direction , very interesting models that reproduce the statistical properties of financial markets , named by the economics community  stylized facts \" @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed @xcite . also in a very related way",
    ", a great amount of work has been carried out by constructing artificial stock markets by means of cellular automata models @xcite .",
    "+ cellular automata ( ca ) are spacetime - like discrete deterministic dynamical systems whose behavior is defined completely in terms of local interactions .",
    "cellular automata were introduced by john von neumann who intended to understand the biological mechanisms of self - reproduction @xcite and have now become an important object of study because of their intrinsic mathematical interest as well as their success as a tool to model complex phenomena in physical , chemical , economical and biological systems , design of parallel computing architectures , traffic models , programming environments , etc @xcite .",
    "+ cellular automata became very popular at the beginning of the 70 s thanks to an article written by martin gardner and published in _",
    "scientific american _ @xcite , about the cellular automaton called _ the game of life _ ( gol ) or",
    "just _ life_. this cellular automaton was invented by the mathematician john h. conway at the end of 60 s and since , it displayed a very rich and interesting complex behavior ; very soon it became the favorite game of the at that time incipient community of computer fans .",
    "life is a class iv bi - dimensional ( shows complex behavior ) totalitarian cellular automaton @xcite .",
    "the updating rule that determines the game of life evolution is applied on a moore neighborhood as follows : a ) a dead cell surrounded by exactly three living cells is born again .",
    "b ) a live cell will die if either it has less than two or more than three living neighbors .",
    "this simple rule produces a very rich and complex behavior , generating self - organized structures and also producing very important and interesting emergent properties ( formation of self - replicating structures , universal computation , etc ) .",
    "it is for this reason that we have chosen life to generate a bi - dimensional random walk and then a time series with expected complex characteristics . in section",
    "[ walk ] we explain how , by using a geometrical procedure applied to life , we can generate a time series @xmath1 , analyzed in this work , that shows statistical properties very similar to those of financial time series , known in the economic community as stylized facts . in section [ stylized ]",
    "we show the numerical results corresponding to these analyses .",
    "due to the need of dealing with a finite size @xmath2 of the ca lattice , in our work we have chosen to program our ca using periodical boundary conditions .",
    "after centering a cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 in the lattice of the ca as shown in figure [ rw]a ) , in order to obtain the one - dimensional observable analyzed in this paper , we construct the position vector @xmath4 of a point following a bidimensional random walk obtained for each time step of the @xmath5 generated points , @xmath6 , as follows :    @xmath7    where @xmath2 , is the total number of cells of the ca , @xmath8 denotes the state ( 1 or 0 ) of the cell in the coordinates @xmath9 with respect to the coordinate system @xmath3 at time step @xmath10 .",
    "so , while the ca evolves , this vector describes how the `` center of mass '' of living cells distribution evolves . ]",
    "is calculated for each time step @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ rw]b ) shows @xmath12 time steps of the evolution of the vector @xmath4 .",
    "our observable will be the distance to the origin @xmath1 of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath11 . in order to analyze the one - dimensional time series generated by @xmath1 as time goes on ,",
    "we construct the returns or logarithmic differences @xmath14 , of the time series @xmath1 as usual : @xmath15 , for @xmath16 .      in order to have certain control of gol initial states , configurations of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 of living cells",
    "were initially set up at random on lattices of size @xmath20 . for each initial density ,",
    "20 random walks of 20000 steps were generated , giving us a total @xmath21 steps to analyze .",
    "considering certain characteristics such as the finite size of the gol lattice , or a particular initial configuration , gol generated fluctuations tend to die out after an undetermined number of time steps .",
    "because of this we have applied a cut off to @xmath1 , @xmath11 , considering its values such as @xmath22 .",
    "figures of next section will show the reason of this data selection more clearly .",
    "in this section we will show that the time series @xmath1 , @xmath11 has statistical properties that resemble the stylized facts of financial time series .",
    "figure [ serie ] shows a plot of @xmath1 for three different time ranges , while figure [ cluster ] shows the graphic of returns vs. time for two different time ranges .",
    "both figures were obtained from one of the typical generated random walks .      returns distribution @xmath14 , for all of our generated samples are shown in figure [ returns]a ) .",
    "figures [ returns]b ) and [ returns]c ) show the returns distribution in a log - log plot for right and left tails respectively .",
    "after applying the cut off to the sample , we construct the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the returns distribution ; this is shown in figure [ pdf ] .",
    "as it can be seen , both pdf tails decay as a power law with exponent @xmath23 ; although it seems that there are more than one power law present along both curves .",
    "figures [ acf ] and [ aacf ] show the auto correlation function ( acf ) of returns and absolute returns for a few realizations of our experiments respectively .",
    "it can be seen that returns acf shows no memory , decaying to noise level almost immediately ( in fact figure [ acf ] looks similar to the acf of a daily financial acf time series ) . on the other hand ,",
    "acf of absolute returns decays quickly to a positive level of about 0.2 and stays fluctuating there , showing a very long range memory ; all this in agreement with the stylized facts .",
    "it is important to remark that although curve of figure [ acf ] does not show correlations , a periodic pattern in each acf there exists ( although it was not shown here ) ; also we have to mention that figure [ aacf ] should look different wether the absolute returns acf were calculated along the full @xmath24 time steps , showing a slower decay more similar to that of financial time series .",
    "this behaviour was not showed here also .      in this section",
    ", the volatility @xmath25 is calculated @xcite by averaging the absolute returns over a time window @xmath26 as follows :    @xmath27    here we have set up @xmath28 1 time lag and a window of 50 time steps .",
    "figure [ vola]a ) displays the volatility for the first @xmath29 time steps of our observable for one of our generated random walks .",
    "lower frame of same figure displays the corresponding volatility distribution .",
    "figure [ voladist ] shows that volatility pdf decays asymptotically as a power law with @xmath30 , again in concordance with the stylized facts .",
    "although also in this figure , as in the pdf of retuns case , more than a single power law are present along the curve .",
    "the objective of this work is to generate in the simplest possible way a time series that displays the stylized facts that are well known to the economic community . by means of a very simple geometrical method , and using a bidimensional cellular automaton , in our case the game of life",
    ", we generate a synthetic time series with the properties of having returns distribution with fat tails , clustering volatility , practically no returns autocorrelations , long memory in acf of absolute returns and volatility distribution decaying as a power law .",
    "we believe that the use of our scheme to generate artificial financial time series can be of help in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of the stylized facts arising in real markets . finally , and about the future work that has to be made , is important to understand if there exists a multipower or a mix up of power laws in returns and volatility distributions as well as the patterns presented in the acfs of the returns and absolute returns .",
