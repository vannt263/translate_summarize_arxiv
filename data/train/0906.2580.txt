    "gapless state is stable at the bec side of the resonance , with gapless fermions residing on one spherical fermi surface in momentum space .",
    "instability towards non - homogeneous loff state occurs only at weak coupling , i.e. loff is favored away from the resonance .",
    "we would like to study the low energy effective theory further .",
    "apart from that , we suggest a possible experimental evidance / signature of the gapless phases .",
    "we predict a sharp increase in outer core of a vortex , i.e. vortex size , upon entering into the gapless phase . to observe this dramatic effect",
    "will require tuning of the parameters of the trap to a gapless bec phase .",
    "it will be interesting to study the core structure of the vortex , including inner and outer core , as well as interaction between two vortices .",
