    "direct charge parity ( cp ) asymmetry in charmless heavy - meson decays is a long and intriguing puzzle that has been widely studied since the seminal bss paper  @xcite in the late 70 s .",
    "the idea , which became the bss mechanism , is that the cp asymmetry comes from the interference between tree and penguin quark level diagrams owning different weak and strong phases .",
    "nowadays , the most common concept used to compute branching fractions and cp asymmetries of charmless b meson decays is the factorization of the decay amplitude , which was started with the naive factorization approach ( nf )  @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough came in the 80 s by the seminal work of lepage and brodsky  @xcite , which was the base to the main frameworks developed to study exclusive heavy meson decays . for the b meson , we recall that those main approaches are : qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "all of them are based on the factorization of the hadronic matrix elements , changing technically how this is done , i.e. , the ordering of the scales involved , treatment of dynamical degrees of freedom and power counting .",
    "one example of the factorization approach with dressed hadronic form factors is given in  @xcite .",
    "there is also an alternative framework to factorization which considers the non - perturbative nature of the process based on the flavour @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite .    in general these approaches considered only short distance amplitudes , without taking into account the constraint that cpt invariance imposes on the cp asymmetry at the hadronic level . for a long time ,",
    "the common belief was that heavy meson b decays would produce many hadronic channels with a homogeneous momenta distribution over the phase space , from the allowed rescattering process to several hadronic channels .",
    "these possible fsi , involving two , three or more hadrons , induced the idea that cpt constraints would not be of practical use in charmless b decays  @xcite .",
    "however , the high sample of experimental data , first with babar and belle and then with lhcb , shows that these multi - mesons rescattering processes are not dominant in charmless multi body b decays  @xcite .    indeed , inspecting the lhcb data distribution of these decays  @xcite",
    ", one can see that the events are placed basically around the dalitz plot boards , dominated by low mass resonances .",
    "the fact that charmless three - body b decays populate regions close to the edge of the dalitz plot , reinforces the idea that those processes are dominated by two - body interactions .",
    "in a recent theoretical paper  @xcite it was shown that these data distribution of charmless three - body b decays is a consequence of the relatively small b meson mass .",
    "following this paper , a homogeneous distribution in the dalitz plot should be possible only for three - body decays of particles with masses that are more than five times larger than the b meson .    in the large compilation of b charmless processes presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds a quite reasonable agreement between theories based on factorization techniques and experimental results available for several branching fractions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays .",
    "however , the same agreement is not seen for the values of cp asymmetries in the same channels  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are many discrepancies not only among the different models but also comparing them to the experimental cp asymmetry measurements . this situation is worse for @xmath4 decays . nonetheless , it is important to note that there are some issues in these channels for both theoretical and experimental descriptions . in the latter ,",
    "the processes @xmath4 are in fact three - body decays and consequently the observables are determined inside the complexity of a three - body phase - space .",
    "in this paper we present a general discussion of the theoretical issues in the @xmath4 decays , arguing that regardless of the model chosen , the cpt constraint can play a crucial role in suppressing the cp asymmetry in these channels .",
    "we also propose a simple model to extract the cp asymmetry from these channels , avoiding the difficulty presented in dalitz amplitude analyses , normally used to extract the values of @xmath1 in these decays .",
    "in literature , the theoretical studies for @xmath4 decays are limited to low mass su(3 ) vector particles : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath9 decays are restricted to one single two - body channel and the branching fraction for their decays are 100% to @xmath10 and to @xmath11 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath8 is slightly different , it decays mainly into @xmath12 but it has also a decay involving three pions through the @xmath13 channel with a branching fraction of 15% @xcite .",
    "the isobar model , as well as k - matrix and other amplitude analyses , widely used by experimentalists for three - body heavy meson decays , considers the bachelor particle as a simple spectator of the process . in this quasi - two - body process or ( 2 + 1 )",
    "approximation , resonances produced in heavy meson decays do not interact with the third particle . within this scenario , the cpt constraint in @xmath5 processes , where @xmath14 @xmath6 or @xmath7 , suggests that there is no room to observe cp asymmetry in these channels .",
    "there is also the @xmath8 resonance , which could show cp asymmetry , but that does not seem possible due to the low contribution of tree diagrams to decays involving this vector particle .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the absence of final state interactions is a hadronic constraint and therefore , the impossibility to observe cp asymmetry in those processes is independent from the relative short distance contribution from tree and penguin diagrams",
    ".    there are at least three other possibilities for @xmath4 decays resulting in inelastic rescattering that can produce cp violation : + ( i ) rescattering from the pseudoscalar - vector like @xmath15 , where x is a new particle or particles .",
    "+ ( ii ) the @xmath16 final state was not produced promptly but is a result of a rescattered process coming from another two - body decay channel , with the strong transition matrix related with the one in ( i ) by detailed balance , or time reversal invariance .",
    "+ ( iii ) a three - body rescattering including the bachelor particle .",
    "the cpt constraint demands that the total cp asymmetry distributed in different channels or phase - space regions coupled with the strong interaction add to zero .",
    "these processes ( i)-(iii ) are estimated to provide small contributions to the cp asymmetry distribution for the @xmath17 meson decay in different channels coupled by the strong interaction .",
    "the flux of cp asymmetry between channels / phase space regions is proportional to the s - matrix expectation value between the different states .    the probability calculation of a light - meson processes ( i ) or a transition amplitude for ( ii ) @xmath18 or @xmath19 should , in principle , start with the qcd theory , which is much beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , a rough estimation of the transition amplitude for a light - meson pair to scatter into a different pair of mesons at the @xmath17 mass is enough to exclude the importance of the coupling between two - body channels at such energies , as long as unitarity is respected .",
    "the off - diagonal s - matrix elements should have a magnitude lower than one due to unitarity .",
    "its modulus square can be interpreted as the probability for the transition between the initial and final channels .",
    "then , our task is to estimate the lorentz invariant matrix element for the transition matrix associated to the inelastic scattering process .",
    "the naive picture for two - body inelastic collision of two initial mesons is the annihilation of these two hadronic states to a quark - antiquark pair that propagates and recombine producing the light - meson pair in the final state .",
    "the contribution from the intermediate state propagation of the quark pair in the mandelstam variable @xmath20 is damped roughly by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the breakup of a meson in a quark - antiquark pair has to bring a damping factor of @xmath21 , because in this case there is an imbalance in the relative momentum of the quarks by @xmath22 .",
    "if in one of the mesons at the initial or final state the relative momentum of the pair is small then the other one should compensate with a large relative momentum , which is damped by the wave function of the meson .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the lowest fock - state component of the light - cone wave function in @xmath23wave decreases with the transverse momentum as @xmath24 @xcite , which we naively associate with the invariant @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the lorentz invariant matrix element of the transition operator should carry a damping factor of at least @xmath25 , where the threshold behaviour was included without changing the asymptotic behaviour in @xmath20 .    according to the above discussion , the damping factor in the off - diagonal s - matrix element corresponding to @xmath18 inelastic collision ,",
    "is estimated as @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the s - matrix element can not be larger than 1 due the unitarity constraint . by choosing the normalization factor as @xmath28 in eq.([sinel ] ) , the maximum value reaches @xmath29 , when @xmath30 .",
    "an example for the application of the formula ( [ sinel ] ) is the @xmath31wave isospin zero @xmath32 cross section , which drops fast and is relevant below @xmath33 1.6 gev  @xcite .",
    "this naive formula is consistent with one of the parametrizations presented in  @xcite for the inelasticity parameter @xmath34 . using this simple formula with @xmath35 gev",
    ", it results in @xmath36 , which provides a large suppression of the off - shell amplitude at the @xmath17 meson mass .    in process ( iii ) , namely a three - body rescattering process",
    ", one of the pseudo - scalar meson scatters with the bachelor particle and , therefore , the cp asymmetry , can flow from one region of the three - body phase - space to another . at the amplitude level",
    "this one - loop process introduces new complex structures that could affect different partial waves .",
    "this effect was studied in the context of the charged @xmath37 decay @xcite , and the results indicate that it was crucial to explain the observed experimental s - wave phase - shift . it was also shown that it is suppressed by a factor of about 20% with respect to the driving term . if we roughly estimate that it has a dependence on @xmath21 , then from the d decay to b decay , one has a suppression factor @xmath38 giving @xmath39 for the three - body rescattering contribution with respect to the driving partonic amplitude .",
    "recently , we performed a qualitative study  @xcite about the importance of fsi rescattering to @xmath40 decay suggesting that the presence of hadronic loops shifts the p - wave phase near the threshold to below zero , and modifies the position of the @xmath41-meson peak as well as its width , in the dalitz plot .",
    "basically , the obtained contribution for the effect was a small percentage , but a more refined analysis which also considers the s - wave rescattering is being developed and should be released soon @xcite",
    ".    however , the amplitude analyses used to extract cp- asymmetry information from the data are model dependent and based on a ( 2 + 1 ) approximation .",
    "thus , there is still room for improvement as will be discussed in the following section .",
    "to avoid the dependence of the isobar model when extracting parameters of cp asymmetry in @xmath5 processes , we propose a simple model independent experimental procedure to extract the @xmath1 from the data .",
    "the method explores the angular distribution of a vector resonance in the dalitz plot and the property that the low mass vector meson is in general close to a scalar one , sharing the same region of the phase space .",
    "thus , one can take a slice from the central mass of a light vector resonance that includes the interference with only one low mass scalar resonance along the other dalitz variable .",
    "these scalar resonances can be the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 or even a non - resonant contribution .    to illustrate the method we begin with a simple situation where @xmath45 decay ( h=@xmath46 or k ) receives contributions only from one vector resonance ( v ) and a constant nonresonant ( nr ) amplitude .",
    "generically , one could represent the total amplitudes for @xmath47 and @xmath48 charge conjugate decays as : _ + & = & a^v_+",
    "e^i ^v_+f^bw_v ( s_,s _ ) + a^nr_+ e^i ^nr_+f^nr , [ rhoampnr1 ] + m_- & = & a^v_- e^i ^v_-f^ bw_v ( s_,s _ ) + a^nr_- e^i ^nr_-f^ nr , [ rhoampnr2 ] where the @xmath49 is a real and scalar non - resonant amplitude , and @xmath50 contains both the fixed weak and strong phases . the vector resonance v is described by a breit - wigner ( bw ) function , @xmath51 , that depends on @xmath52 , one of the invariant variables at dalitz plot , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the energy dependent relativistic width .",
    "the vector amplitude has an additional strong phase , inherent to the bw form , and a spin 1 factor , proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the angle @xmath56 is defined as the helicity angle between the bachelor and center of mass of the two particles produced by the resonance . for a vector resonance in the @xmath57 channel , the cosine of helicity angle is given by  @xcite ( s _ , s _ ) & = &  , [ cos ] where @xmath58 is the kallen function and @xmath59 .",
    "we investigate the behaviour of @xmath60 for values of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath63 remain stable as a function of @xmath64 around the center value of @xmath65 , i.e. , within a region of about the width of the resonance .",
    "therefore , the helicity angle can be assumed to be a function of only @xmath64 : @xmath66 .",

    "instead , we propose to look for the distribution on the @xmath69 variable around the resonance mass , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "the usefulness of this procedure is that it enables us to identify the signature of @xmath71 when looking at the amplitude distribution in @xmath64 . by doing that",

    "the procedure to calculate the @xmath1 is straightforward : we choose a 50 mev mass window around the vector resonance @xmath6 , integrating it in the parallel dalitz variable , and then fit the binned distributions of @xmath67 and @xmath68 histograms in the orthogonal dalitz variable with a quadratic polynomial function of @xmath71 in the interval of 5 to 23.5 gev@xmath78 . following that",

    "<S> charge parity asymmetry in charmless b meson decays is a key issue to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical calculations have been performed using short distance factorization approaches which , in general , do not take into account the cpt invariance constraint . </S>",
    "<S> for each channel with cp violation there is an equal amount of cp asymmetry in another channel or other channels , with an opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> this happens if these channels are coupled through final state interactions ( fsi ) . in the specific process @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> involving one pseudo - scalar and one vector particle in the final state , we argue that the cp asymmetry , inherent from a short distance mechanism , could be suppressed due to the cpt constraint . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a sensitive and practical experimental method to identify even a small cp asymmetry , which provides the values for @xmath1 without the need for an amplitude analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this method , if applied directly to data , will enable to extract the cp asymmetry information in a model independent way and check to which extend the suggested suppression due to the cpt constraint is verified . </S>"
