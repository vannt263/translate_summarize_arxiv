    "the best fit produced reasonable residuals ( @xmath61 km  @xmath13 ) for an orbit with a period of 3.448 days , @xmath14=-8.4 km  @xmath13 , consistent with the fit above , and mass ratio 0.93 , again consistent with the fit above .",

    "i estimate the true masses of the stars as 1.3 and 1.2 m@xmath16 based on the effective temperatures ( 6500 and 6250 k ) obtained in the spectral fit described in   3 and the mk spectral - type calibration given in @xcite ; these masses are uncertain by @xmath00.1 m@xmath16 . calculating the inclination from these masses",

    "the stars should have radii of 1.31.6 r@xmath16 , so their separation is about 9 stellar radii .",
    "of primary interest for understanding the dusty debris disk around bd+20 307 is the age of the system .",
    "although the orbit is not well measured , a reasonable fit is obtained with e=0 .",
    "binaries of any age with periods less than @xmath08 days are found in circular orbits @xcite .",
    "so , e=0 is consistent with the 3.4 day period and is no indication of the age of the system .",
    "the formation of close binaries may depend on the presence of another star in the system ; @xcite find that 80% of binaries with periods @xmath67 days are actually in higher order multiple systems .",
    "it is unknown whether bd+20 307 has another , wider , component , but this should be investigated .",
    "taking @xmath19 from the spectral modeling , the rotational velocity of the stars is 21 km s@xmath11 . a standard radius for a t@xmath20=6250  k star would be 1.3 r@xmath16 , but solar - like stars with active chromospheres have somewhat larger radii than their non - active counterparts @xcite .",
    "stellar radii of 1.3  1.6 r@xmath16 correspond to rotational periods of 3  3.7  d. the close agreement between the rotation period and the orbital period suggests that the stars are tidally synchronized .",
    "the timescale for synchronization for stars of mass similar to the sun is given by @xcite , and for equal mass components is @xmath21 where p is the orbital period .",
    "given a period of 3.5 d , t@xmath22 is 100 myr .",
    "this provides a lower limit to the age of the system",
    ".    tidal coupling in a close binary can give rise to enhanced magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "so , the central reversals observed in both stars ca h and k lines need not arise from youth but could be from their interaction .    for stars with deep convective zones",
    ", there is a tight correlation between lithium abundance with age and spectral type , but for stars with t@xmath20 @xmath0 6500  k , there is little li depletion by the age of the hyades @xcite .",
    "a typical li equivalent width for a star with b - v of 0.5 in the hyades is 90 m , 1.5 times that for bd+20 307 .",
    "furthermore , tidally locked systems in the hyades show inhibited li depletion @xcite .",
    "the situation for older stars is more complex .",
    "stars even hotter than the sun apparently do deplete li after reaching the main sequence .",
    "@xcite summarize the li abundances in open clusters of various ages , including the wide spread in abundances among members of old ( @xmath11 gyr ) clusters .",
    "hot stars can show substantial depletions .",
    "for example in the 1 gyr old cluster ngc 3960 , stars with @xmath23 ( t@xmath24 6250  k ) show a range ew(li ) of @xmath610 to 80 m  @xcite .",
    "initial metalicity can have a large effect on main sequence li abundance , but given their tight orbit , the two stars in bd+20 307 presumably formed from the same molecular cloud material at the same metalicity .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath020% of wide field binaries showed disparate li .",
    "stars may also be polluted by li and other elements during planetary evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could account for differences in li abundance between wide binaries and within clusters that should have the same initial metalicity .",
    "especially for stars with small convective zones , like the components of bd+20 307 , material deposited should last for the entire main sequence lifetime .",
    "the tightness of the bd+20 307 orbit means that any planets must be circumbinary .",
    "if disparate pollution were to occur , it might be expected to favor the more massive star .",
    "it is indeed the primary star that shows the greater li line strength .    taken together , the modest li line strength of the primary and very low li line strength for the secondary argue for an old age of the system , certainly greater than that of the hyades and probably @xmath1 1 gyr . in this case , the dust generating event happened quite late . in the solar system ,",
    "the last era of major planetesimal removal happened at an age 600 - 800 myr @xcite .",
    "it is further tempting to speculate on what happens to the dust ring over time .",
    "poynting - robertson and solar wind drag should cause the grains at 0.55 au to fall onto the central stars on timescales @xmath61000 yr @xcite .",
    "meteorites in the solar system contain li , no matter where they formed in the original proto - planetary disk @xcite .",
    "thus the opportunity seems to exist for substantial stellar pollution with li by the dust around bd+20 307 .",
    "perhaps this dust is being swept up by a body orbiting between the ring and the binary and thus can not pollute the surface of the stars .",
    "a detailed abundance study of the stars could reveal the extent of any pollution .",
    "bd+20 307 is a spectroscopic binary composed of two similar stars of late f spectral - type in a short , rotationally synchronized orbit of @xmath03.4 days .",
    "standard chromospheric - age calibrations for single solar - type stars are therefore not applicable to this system .",
    "the binary is likely quite old , @xmath1 1 gyr , in order to allow the two stars to develop quite different lithium equivalent widths .",
    "the collision that produced the circumbinary dust ring must have happened recently , given the short timescale for removal of material at 0.5 au , and could be expected to pollute the envelopes of the stars .",
    "that they have such low lithium could be evidence that the dust does not actually reach them .",
