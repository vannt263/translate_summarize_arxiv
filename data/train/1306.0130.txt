    "quantum discord @xcite is the most promising measure of bipartite quantum correlations beyond celebrated quantum entanglement .",
    "some mixed separable states behave `` non - classically '' with respect to the local measurements and exactly such states have non zero quantum discord .",
    "as it was shown recently , almost all quantum states have non - vanishing discord @xcite , so an arbitrary small disturbance can drive a classically correlated state into a state with genuine quantum correlations .",
    "in contrast to the entanglement , even local noise can increase or create quantum discord @xcite and it was shown that a trace - preserving local channel can create quantum correlations in some classical states if and only if it is not commutativity preserving channel ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although this phenomenon was described in some recent publications ( see e.g. @xcite ) we reconsider it again in a simple and natural physical situation .",
    "it turns out that to observe such local creation of quantum correlations it is enough to take two non - interacting two - level atoms not completely isolated from the environment .",
    "time evolution of the system is given by a dissipative process of spontaneous emission .",
    "in the markov approximation , this time evolution is described by the semi - group of local completely positive mappings i.e. local quantum channels .",
    "one can check that the channels are not commutativity preserving , so local creation of quantum correlations can appear .",
    "we show that all classically correlated initial states ( so called classical - classical and classical - quantum states ) are driven by the process of spontaneous emission into the states with transient non - zero quantum discord .",
    "the created discord is transient because during time evolution all correlations asymptotically decay .",
    "apart from the usual spontaneous emission of two atoms , we also consider `` one - sided '' spontaneous emission in which only one atom emits photons and the other is completely decoupled from the environment .",
    "it turns out that in such system , local creation of quantum discord is more effective .    to quantify non - classical correlations in bipartite states which may differ from entanglement , we use geometric quantum discord @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for other geometric measures of correlations ) .",
    "classically correlated quantum states have zero discord and we take them as the initial states of the studied evolution .",
    "we found it useful to consider also some measure of total correlation present in the system . in our study",
    "we propose to use an algebraic measure given by so called maximal mutual correlation @xmath0 , introduced in the context of the algebraic approach to quantum non - separability @xcite .",
    "this quantity is closely related to correlation distance of the state @xcite i.e. the trace norm distance between given state and the tensor product of its partial traces .",
    "it is easy to compute and contains some information about correlations beyond quantum discord . in particular , in the case of classically correlated states @xmath1 and it encodes the properties of classical probability distributions defining such states ( sect .",
    "ii ) . in our",
    "analysis @xmath0 plays only an additional role .",
    "it can help to choose appropriate initial classical state , since as we show , during the time evolution caused by local noise , part of the initial classical correlations are transformed into genuine quantum correlations and such creation of quantum discord is effective when the initial value of @xmath0 is large .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to study time evolution of a measure of quantum correlations",
    ". geometric measure of quantum discord is defined in terms of minimal distance of the given state from the set of classical states , so the proper choice of such a distance is very important .",
    "the measure proposed in @xcite uses a hilbert - schmidt distance in a set of states . in this case",
    "the minimization process is simple and can be realized analytically for arbitrary two - qubit states . despite of this feature , geometric discord based on the hilbert - schmidt distance has some unwanted properties .",
    "the most serious problem with such a measure is that it may increase under local operations on the unmeasured subsystem @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this defect can be repaired by using other norm in the set of states . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the best choice is to use the trace norm ( or schatten 1-norm ) in place of hilbert - schmidt norm to define geometric discord .",
    "such defined measure will be able to consistently quantify nonclassical correlations , but it is more difficult to compute .",
    "the closed formula for it is known only in the case of bell - diagonal or x - type two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "for technical reasons in this paper we adopt the standard definition of geometric discord based on the hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "we consider the time evolution of the classical - classical and classical - quantum initial states with the largest possible value of maximal mutual correlation @xmath0 and we shown that for such states the geometric discord grows from zero to some maximal value and then asymptotically decays .",
    "there is no danger that such production of quantum correlations is an artificial effect of sensitivity of the quantum discord to the choice of distance measure , because the evolution always concerns the measured subsystem .",
    "moreover , in the case when the unmeasured subsystem also evolves , the production of correlations is smaller ( sect .",
    "the comparison with the local evolution of trace distance discord even more supports the conclusion that this effect is real .",
    "preliminary results of the analysis of this problem show that the trace distance discord is also locally created @xcite .",
    "we start with the introduction of the standard notion of geometric quantum discord @xcite .",
    "when a @xmath2 bipartite system @xmath3 is prepared in a state @xmath4 and we perform local measurement on the subsystem @xmath5 , almost all states @xmath4 will be disturbed due to such measurement .",
    "the ( one - sided ) geometric discord @xmath6 can be defined as the minimal disturbance , measured by the squared hilbert - schmidt distance , induced by any projective measurement @xmath7 on subsystem @xmath5 i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 here we adopt normalized version of the geometric discord , introduced in ref .",
    "there is a subclass of states which are left unperturbed by at least one measurement .",
    "such `` classical - quantum '' states @xmath10 satisfy @xmath11 for some von neumann measurement @xmath12 .",
    "obviously @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 for some orthonormal basis @xmath16 , @xmath17 are quantum states in @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the classical probability distribution .",
    "the geometric discord can be also interpreted as the distance between the state @xmath4 and the closest classical - quantum state .",
    "one can also consider fully classically correlated quantum states ( known as `` classical - classical '' states ) , defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are von neumann measurements on subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath18 respectively , and @xmath23 is a two - dimensional probability distribution . the states ( [ cc ] ) satisfy @xmath24 but also have zero discord over two - sided projective measurements @xcite .    in the case of two qubits studied in the present paper",
    ", there is an explicit expression for @xmath25 @xcite @xmath26 where the components of the vector @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 the matrix @xmath29 has elements @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath32 .",
    "one also finds a simple relation between geometric quantum discord and entanglement measured by normalized negativity @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for partial transposition and @xmath35 .",
    "the relation is as follows @xcite : for all pure states @xmath36 whereas for every general two - qubit state @xmath4 @xmath37 notice that the relation ( [ dvn ] ) is not universal - there are conterexamples in higher dimensinal systems @xcite .",
    "we also shortly discuss the notion of trace distance geometric discord @xmath38 .",
    "this quantity is defined as follows @xcite @xmath39 in contrast to the geometric discord based on the hilbert - schmidt norm , @xmath40 is nonincreasing under general local operations on subsystem @xmath18 , but its computation is much more involved @xcite .",
    "also the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath40 is not clear .",
    "it can show @xcite that for bell - diagonal states @xmath41 but for general two - qubit states the inequality ( [ d1vdg ] ) can not be true . in the present paper we study time evolution of @xmath25 , analogous problem for @xmath40 will be considered elsewhere @xcite .    in a study of time evolution of classical and quantum correlations in a bipartite systems",
    "it is useful to consider some measure of total correlations present in the system . in this paper",
    "we propose to use so called maximal mutual correlation @xmath42 , a quantity motivated by the algebraic approach to quantum entanglement @xcite . in the algebraic formulation ,",
    "a bipartite quantum system is defined by the algebra of observables @xmath43 with distinguished mutually commuting subalgebras @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponding to subsystems .",
    "any state @xmath4 defines a linear functional @xmath46 on the algebra @xmath43 @xmath47 _ maximal mutual correlation _ between the subalgebras @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the state @xmath4 is defined as @xmath48 in the formula ( [ maxtot ] ) , the supremum is taken over all elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 indicates how much given state differs from a product state when we take into account only local observables .",
    "notice that @xmath52 where the marginal states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by partial traces @xmath55 and @xmath56 of a density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "thus maximal mutual correlation is always dominated by the _ correlation distance _",
    "@xmath57 given by @xmath58 this quantity was recently introduced by hall @xcite in the context of analysis of quantum mutual information .    for two qubits",
    "we may choose @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are normalized vectors in @xmath62 .",
    "then @xmath63 with the correlation matrix @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 thus @xmath66 and @xmath42 is given by the matrix norm of the corresponding correlation matrix i.e. the largest singular value of @xmath67 .",
    "it turns out that for any pure state @xmath68 , @xmath69 gives the same information as any other measure of quantum correlations .",
    "in particular @xcite @xmath70 for mixed states we expect that @xmath71 the second inequality was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite whereas the first one can be proved analytically for bell - diagonal states and numerical simulations suggest that it is valid for all mixed two - qubit states @xcite .",
    "the first inequality also indicates that @xmath0 contains some information about correlations beyond quantum discord i.e. classical correlations present in the quantum states . for fully classically correlated states @xmath72 given by ( [ cc ] ) one can show that @xcite @xmath73 the right hand side of the equation ( [ klasik ] ) can be interpreted as the modulus of covariance of two discrete random variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 with values in the set @xmath76 and with join probability distribution defined by probabilities @xmath77 as follows @xmath78 so indeed @xmath72 is only classically correlated and @xmath79 on the other hand , for classical - quantum states @xmath10 given by ( [ cq ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the bloch vectors corresponding to the states @xmath82 i.e. @xmath83 the factor @xmath84 in equation ( [ klqu ] ) can be connected with statistical properties of discrete random variable @xmath74 with values in the set @xmath76 and probability distribution @xmath85",
    "one checks that @xmath86 so @xmath87 in that case maximal mutual correlation depends not only on the classical probability distribution , but also on the properties of quantum states of the subsystem @xmath18 .    in the next section",
    "we will study time evolution of initial states @xmath10 and @xmath72 in the system of two - level atoms .",
    "we consider only spontaneous emission of independent atoms and show that this simple and natural physical process leads to the transient creation of quantum correlations out of classical correlations .",
    "consider a system of two independent two - level atoms ( atom @xmath5 and atom @xmath18 ) interacting with environment at zero temperature . when we take into account only the dissipative process of spontaneous emission , the dynamics of the system is given by the master equation @xcite @xmath88 where for @xmath89 @xmath90 in the above equation @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the single atom spontaneous emission rate .",
    "time evolution of the initial density matrix @xmath4 of the system is given by the semi - group @xmath93 generated by @xmath94 and such evolution has a well known properties .",
    "let us remind here the matrix elements of the state @xmath95 with respect to the basis @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 are the ground states and excited states of atoms @xmath5 and @xmath18 ) @xmath98 and @xmath99 the remaining matrix elements can be obtained by the hermiticity condition .",
    "the evolution given by the semi - group @xmath93 is ergodic : for any initial state , the asymptotic state is equal to the ground state of two atoms .    to investigate the process of local generation of quantum discord , it is instructive to consider `` one - sided '' spontaneous emission i.e. time evolution @xmath100 generated only by @xmath101 . here",
    "the atom @xmath5 spontaneously emits photons , whereas the atom @xmath18 is isolated from the environment .",
    "such dynamics has peculiar properties , so we discuss it in some details . in that case",
    "the state @xmath95 at time @xmath102 has the following matrix elements @xmath103 and @xmath104 again the remaining matrix elements can be obtained by the hermiticity condition .    from the equations ( [ solution1 ] ) and ( [ solution2 ] ) it follows that in contrast to the usual process of spontaneous emission , now there are non - trivial asymptotic states of the system , given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the projection on the ground state of the atom @xmath5 and @xmath4 is the initial density matrix .    notice that in both cases , asymptotic state is a product state , so any measure of quantum correlations should asymptotically vanish during such time evolutions .",
    "but the transient quantum correlation of some states still can exist . to show this in an explicit way ,",
    "consider the initial states @xmath10 and @xmath72 . in the case of two qubits ,",
    "these states are defined in terms of orthogonal projectors @xmath107 \\frac{1}{2}e^{i{\\varphi}}\\,\\sin 2{\\vartheta}&\\sin^{2}{\\vartheta}\\end{pmatrix},\\\\[2 mm ] & p_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix } \\sin^{2}{\\vartheta}&-\\frac{1}{2}e^{-i{\\varphi}}\\,\\sin 2{\\vartheta}\\\\[2 mm ] -\\frac{1}{2}e^{i{\\varphi}}\\,\\sin 2{\\vartheta}&\\cos^{2}{\\vartheta}\\end{pmatrix}. \\end{split}\\label{p1p2}\\ ] ] in particular @xmath108 where the states @xmath82 are given by ( [ rob ] ) .",
    "similarly , up to the local unitary equivalence , the states @xmath72 can be written as @xmath109    since local dissipative evolution can only degrade maximal mutual correlations and the relation ( [ nierow ] ) is valid for all times , the initial state should have a large value of @xmath0 . in the case of classically correlated states ( [ rocc2 ] ) ,",
    "the largest value of @xmath110 is obtained when for example @xmath111 detailed analysis of time evolution of such initial states shows that the maximal creation of quantum correlations happens when in the parametrization of orthogonal projections ( [ p1p2 ] ) we take @xmath112 .",
    "so we first consider time evolution of the initial state @xmath113 where @xmath114 we study evolution of ( [ rocc1 ] ) given by the semi - group @xmath93 as well as one - sided evolution defined by @xmath100 i.e. @xmath115 in both cases , the maximal mutual correlation decays @xmath116 but this decay is slower for one - sided spontaneous emission . on the other hand @xmath117 with @xmath118 \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath119 where @xmath120 as we see , one - sided geometric discord behaves differently then @xmath0 during time evolution . in both cases",
    "@xmath25 grows from zero to some maximal value and then it asymptotically goes to zero .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath102 @xmath121 and similarly for one - sided spontaneous emission .",
    "notice also that one - sided spontaneous emission produces more quantum correlations then the usual process of local spontaneous emission of two atoms ( fig.1 ) .",
    "it can be connected with the fact that the time evolution operator is applied only to the part of the system which is measured . on the other hand , one - sided evolution operating only on subsystem @xmath18 can not produce non - zero ( one - sided ) quantum discord @xmath25 , since initial classical - classical or classical - quantum states become classical - quantum states under the evolution .",
    "for other initial states of this type , the analysis of of time evolution of geometric discord is much more involved .",
    "here we consider only the initial states @xmath122 and @xmath123 defined by @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows evolution of @xmath25 for such initial states , compared to the analogous evolution for the initial state @xmath126 .",
    "we see that for such initial states , the creation of quantum discord is less effective .",
    "consider now @xmath10 as the initial state .",
    "it follows from the formula ( [ cmrocq ] ) that for such state the largest value of @xmath0 is obtained when @xmath127 and the bloch vectors @xmath128 and @xmath129 are opposite and normalized i.e. the states @xmath130 and @xmath131 are orthogonal projectors .",
    "such @xmath10 is the specific example of classical - classical state . for the typical classical - quantum state",
    ", @xmath0 is always less then @xmath132 .",
    "direct calculations also show that similarly as in the classical - classical case , the creation of quantum correlations is maximal when the projectors in the `` classical '' part of @xmath10 are chosen to be @xmath133 and the initial state is the following @xmath134 the creation of quantum discord still depends on the quantum part of the state @xmath4 . to study this dependence ,",
    "consider the states of the subsystem @xmath18 defined by normalized bloch vectors @xmath135 notice that @xmath136 where the parameter @xmath137 is fixed .",
    "for such initial states and dynamics given by spontaneous emission of two atoms , one obtains @xmath138 with @xmath139 again @xmath140 grows from zero to the maximal value @xmath141 and then decays to zero .",
    "the maximum of the created discord depends only on the angle @xmath142 between the bloch vectors @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( or a distance between them ) i.e. in contrast to the classical part of @xmath4 it does not depend on detailed structure of the states on the subsystem @xmath18 but only on the hilbert - schmidt distance between them .",
    "@xmath141 as a function of @xmath142 has its largest value for @xmath143 i.e. for classical - classical initial state ( fig.3 ) . for @xmath144 or @xmath145 ,",
    "the produced discord is zero , since the corresponding initial states are product states and local time evolution can not create any quantum correlations in the system @xcite . from this plot",
    "we see also that all classical - quantum states of this type with non - zero distance between @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( i.e. with non - zero value of @xmath0 ) evolve into states with non - trivial quantum correlations .",
    "general class of classical - quantum states is much more difficult to study , but the numerical calculations suggests the same behavior of geometric discord .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of local creation of quantum discord in the system of independent two - level atoms coupled to the vacuum",
    ". individual spontaneous emission of the atoms leads to the local evolution destroying quantum entanglement . at the same time",
    ", this kind of evolution can create quantum discord of separable states .",
    "we have shown that all classically correlated initial states are driven by the process of spontaneous emission into the states which are still separable but have non - zero quantum discord .",
    "the largest value of the created discord is obtained for the classical - classical states ( [ rocc2 ] ) for which @xmath146 and the corresponding orthogonal projectors ( [ p1p2 ] ) are defined by @xmath112 . for the classical - quantum states ( [ rocq2 ] )",
