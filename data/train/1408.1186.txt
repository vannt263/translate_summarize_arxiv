    "in the last few years , the entanglement which comes from quantum information may lead to the further insight into the other areas of physics such as condensed matter and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "entanglement can be of various types , e.g. , bipartite , multipartite , entanglement entropy etc , for which a number of quantitative measures exist .",
    "the entanglement content of quantum states and its variations have been extensively investigated in recent years@xcite .",
    "however , it is not the whole story and the entanglement dose not show all quantum correlations among different constituents of a quantum system . the notion of quantum discord ( qd ) introduced by ollivier and zurek@xcite can measure the quantumness of correlations ( including entanglement ) .",
    "the qd is considered as quantum correlation and quantum resource likewise entanglement .",
    "it is curious to ask what the characteristic of qd is at finite temperature , and what the differences are between thermal qd ( @xmath0 ) and entanglement in a system .",
    "the authors pointed out that the qd , in contrast to the entanglement of formation ( eof ) , can detect those quantum correlations present in certain separable mixed states@xcite .    in the topic of quantum magnets , a lack of inversion symmetry",
    "make ones , to consider an extra exchange coupling between spins in the magnetic materials than the usual and well known the isotropic exchange @xmath1 . in this respect ,",
    "dzyaloshinskii has shwon@xcite that an antisymmetric exchange @xmath2 should be considered in these magnetic materials .",
    "later , moriya has shown@xcite that inclusion of the spin orbit coupling on the magnetic ions in the 1st and 2nd order leads to antisymmetric and anisotropic exchange respectively .",
    "this interaction is , however , rather difficult to handle analytically , but it is one of the agents responsible for magnetic frustration . since this interaction may induce spiral spin arrangements in the ground state@xcite , it is closely involved with ferroelectricity in multiferroic spin chains@xcite . besides , the dm interaction plays an important role in explaining the electron spin resonance experiments in some one - dimensional antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "moreover , the dm interaction modifies the dynamic properties@xcite and the quantum entanglement@xcite of spin chains@xcite .",
    "behavior of quantum and classical correlations in the xy - spin chain with dm interaction also was discussed@xcite .",
    "using bethe ansatz technique , authors in ref.@xcite , have investigated the qd in the spin-1/2 xxz chain system .    in this article",
    "we study the thermal behavior of the pairwise qd and eof , in an infinite spin-@xmath3 ising chain with added dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction subjected to an external longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "such contributions , to the best knowledge of authors , have not been considered in previous works . here ,",
    "using the jordan - wigner transformations@xcite we diagonalize the hamiltonian of the system and then obtain the qd and eof as a function of order parameters .",
    "we also use macroscopic thermodynamic properties as entanglement witness to detect the presence of entanglement in solid state systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we briefly review the definition of the qd and the eof from the information theory point of view . in sect .",
    "3 we introduce the spin-1/2 ising chain with dm interaction and describe briefly the technique of jordan - wigner transformation and the mean - filed approximation used to diagonalize the hamiltonian . in sect .",
    "4 we analyze the behavior of the qd and the eof under the influence of the dm interaction , the longitudinal magnetic field and the temperature . in sect .",
    "5 we use macroscopic thermodynamic witness to detect quantum entanglement region in solids which is described by our model . finally , in sect .",

    "the total correlation between two systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whose state is mathematically represented by a joint probability distribution @xmath6 , can be obtained by the mutual information    we first present a brief review of the qd , which is defined as the difference between two expressions of mutual information extended from the classical to the quantum system . in classical information theory , the total correlation between two systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 , whose state is mathematically represented by a joint probability distribution @xmath6 , can be obtained by the mutual information    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the shannon entropy , and @xmath9 shows the probability of an event @xmath10 relevant to the system @xmath4 or @xmath5 or the joint system @xmath11 . by using the bayes rule",
    ", one can rewrite the mutual information as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the classical conditional entropy and it is employed to quantify the ignorance ( on average ) regarding the value of @xmath4 when one knows @xmath5 . in classical information theory , these two expressions are equivalent , but there is a difference between them in the quantum world . in order to generalize these expressions to the quantum world , we replace classical probability distribution by the density operator @xmath14 and the shannon entropy by the von neumann entropy @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath16 denotes the density operator of a composite bipartite system @xmath11 , then @xmath17 the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath18 . now one can give the quantum versions of eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , respectively : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a quantum generalization of the conditional entropy for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and it can not be directly obtained via the replacement of the shannon entropy by the von neumann entropy .",
    "to get access quantum conditional entropy , we choose projective measurements on @xmath5 described by a complete set of orthogonal projectors , @xmath21 , corresponding to outcomes labeled by @xmath10 .",
    "once the measurement is made , the state of the system is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the identity operator for the subsystem @xmath4 and @xmath9 denotes the probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath10 .",
    "the quantum analogue of the conditional entropy is given by @xmath25 and then the quantum extension of classical mutual information is given by @xmath26 when projective measurements are made on the subsystem @xmath5 , the non - classical correlations between the subsystems are removed . since the value of @xmath27 depends on the choice of @xmath28 , @xmath29",
    "should be maximized over all @xmath28 to ensure that it contains the whole of the classical correlations .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath30 provides a quantitative measure of the total classical correlations@xcite .",
    "once @xmath31 is in hand , qd can be obtained by subtracting it from the quantum mutual information @xmath32      here , we give a short introduction about the entanglement of formation , a well known tool for measuring the entanglement@xcite . to this end",

    "the ground state phase diagram of the model is known@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the model for @xmath52 is gapless and the system is in the so - called luttinger - liquid ( ll ) phase with a power - law decay of correlations . in the ising - like region @xmath53",

    "[ ent - qd - temperature ] , we have presented thermal behavior of the concurrence ( fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - temperature](a ) , ( b ) ) and the qd ( fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - temperature](c ) , ( d ) ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen that at zero temperature , nn spins are entangled in the quantum ll phase ( @xmath113 ) . by increasing temperature both concurrence and qd start to decrease .",
    "there is a field - independent critical temperature ( @xmath114 ) point in which concurrence vanishes , whereas qd shows an asymptotic behavior which is in agreement with results obtained by bethe ansatz approach@xcite . in principle , at the mentioned critical temperature a part of quantum correlations which contributes in the entanglement of formation will be destroyed by classical thermal fluctuations .",
    "so at @xmath115 the concurrence is zero and one can derive the equation @xmath116 by solving this equation , the critical temperature , @xmath117 , will be obtained in whole range of parameters .",
    "note in the absence of the lf @xmath79 , at any value of the temperature and dm interaction , thus the critical temperature can be recast as @xmath118        moreover , for the lf more than the quantum critical point , nn spins are unentangled at zero temperature ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - temperature ] ) . by increasing the temperature from zero ,",
    "nn spins remain unentangled up to a critical temperature , @xmath119 .",
    "the existence of this critical temperature can be related to the fact that the system is gapped in the saturated ferromagnetic phase .",
    "it shows that in the gapped saturated ferromagnetic phase , the quantum correlations appear only at a finite value of the temperature proportional to the spin gap .",
    "as soon as the temperature increases from @xmath119 , both the concurrence and qd retrieve and take a maximum value .",
    "it be should noted that the amount of the @xmath120 is almost three times bigger than the maximum value of the concurrence .",
    "more increasing the temperature , the concurrence and qd decrease and concurrence reaches to zero at a second critical temperature @xmath121 , while qd again shows asymptotic behavior .",
    "this can be considered as an important difference between the qd and concurrence .",
    "the existence of the second critical temperature shows that thermal fluctuations destroy a part of quantum correlations related to the concurrence .",
    "the effect of the lf on the quantum correlations is studied in fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - h ] . in this figure , the concurrence ( fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - h](a ) and ( b ) ) and the qd ( fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - h](c ) and ( d ) ) are plotted as a function of the lf . at zero temperature ,",
    "nn spins are entangled in the absence of the lf@xcite .",
    "when a lf applies the nn spins remain entangled up to the critical lf ( @xmath122 ) . in the saturated ferromagnetic field",
    "the system becomes unentangled .",
    "it is worth to note that at zero temperature the qd also show a critical field in which it is zero in the saturated ferromagnetic phase . at finite temperature , both concurrence and",
    "qd decrease with increasing the lf and vanishes in a lf which depends on the temperature . here",
    "we point out the dm interaction effects on quantum correlations . concurrence and qd show minor decreasing trend versus temperature for higher dm interaction .",
    "it is obvious how the higher dm interaction in the system can persist over quantum fluctuations and preserve the quantum correlations .",
    "this future is more profound in the concurrence . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - h ] we have only chosen two dm interactions @xmath123 to verify this fact . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on this issue in details .",
    "[ ent - qd - d ] shows the behavior of the concurrence and the qd versus the dm interaction .",
    "when dm interaction is very small , the ground state of the system is in the neel phase in the region @xmath113 . in the neel phase",
    "the nn spins are entangled @xcite . on the other hand , in the saturated ferromagnetic phase , @xmath124",
    ", nn spins are unentangled at zero temperature .",
    "it is obvious that by applying the dm interaction , concurrence and qd increase and reach to a saturation value .",
    "in addition , by increasing temperature all quantum correlations reduce , but only quantum correlations of the concurrence will be destroyed at a critical temperature . to this reason , a zero - plateau is observed in the curve of the concurrence ( fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - d](a ) ) .",
    "the existence of the zero - plateau in fig .",
    "[ ent - qd - d](b ) is rooted to the quantum fluctuations in the saturated ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the lake of zero - plateau in the curve of the qd confirms this fact that the quantum correlations of qd are very robust in comparison with concurrence .",
    "the realization that entanglement can also affect macroscopic properties of bulk solid - state systems , has increased the interest in characterizations of entanglement in terms of macroscopic thermodynamical@xcite observables .",
    "the entanglement witness is called an observable which can distinguish between entangled and separable states in the quantum physics@xcite . from an experimental point of view , several methods for detection of entanglement using witness operators have been proposed @xcite . as a result of these studies ,",
    "entanglement witnesses have been obtained in terms of expectation values of thermodynamic observables such as internal energy , magnetization and magnetic susceptibility .",

    ", results concerning hamiltonian based on diagonal exchange interactions@xcite do not apply . in a recent work@xcite",
    ", an appropriately generalized entanglement witness is constructed where will be used in following .",

    "[ witness-1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . in the presence of the magnetic field",
    "less than the quantum critical point ( fig .",
    "[ witness-1](a ) ) , by adding dm interaction , the critical temperature increases almost linearly in complete agreement with our results on the concurrence and also refs.@xcite .",
    "the effect of the lf on the critical temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ witness-1](b ) .",
    "as it is seen the critical temperature decreases by increasing the lf and will be zero for values of the lf @xmath136 .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the thermal quantum correlations in the 1d spin-1/2 ising model with added dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction in the presence of a uniform longitudinal magnetic field(lf ) .",
    "first , using the jordan - wigner transformation the model is transformed to a 1d fermionized model .",
    "then , using the mean - field approach the energy spectrum in an infinite chain is obtained .    by using the mean - field order parameters ,",
    "we have determined the quantum discord ( qd ) and the concurrence between nearest neighbor ( nn ) spins at finite temperature . in principle , our approach is applicable to all cases contain the interacting fermions .",
    "a complete comparison between concurrence and the qd is done . at zero temperature ,",
    "nn spins are entangled in the neel phase ( @xmath113 ) and unentangled in the saturated ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "when system is in the neel phase , the thermal fluctuations decrease all quantum correlations , but only destroy the quantum correlations of the concurrence .",
    "the quantum correlations of the qd exist even at finite temperatures which shows that the quantum correlations of qd are very stronger than the concurrence . on the other hand ,",
    "when the ground state has the ferromagnetic long - range order , there is not any quantum correlation at zero temperature .",
    "increasing the temperature from zero , the nn spins remains unentangled up to a critical temperature which is rooted in the spin gap .",
    "more increasing the temperature , the concurrence and the qd regain and take a maximum value .",
    "the amount of the @xmath120 is almost three times larger than the maximum value of the concurrence .",
    "after this maximum , concurrence and qd decrease and concurrence reaches zero at a critical temperature while qd never goes zero .",
    "the existence of the second critical temperature shows that thermal fluctuations will destroy a part of quantum correlations related to the concurrence but are not enough strong to destroy all quantum correlations .    using macroscopic thermodynamic witnesses we have investigated quantum entanglement region in solids within our model .",
    "we have found that in the presence of the magnetic field less than the quantum critical point by adding dm interaction , the critical temperature increases almost linearly .",
