    "derivation of macroscopic thermodynamic laws from microscopic dynamics is an outstanding problem of statistical physics .",
    "one of the most interesting issues is explaining the _ time - asymmetric _ macroscopic evolution of statistical systems ( the thermodynamic arrow of time ) .",
    "it is well known that one - time - direction macroscopic dynamics can not be a consequence of the _ time - symmetric _ microscopic dynamics ruling the behavior of the microscopic constituents of a statistical system .",
    "first arguments of statistical type explaining the macroscopic time - arrow were given by l. boltzmann@xcite : after some constrains are removed from an isolated macroscopic system being initially in a macrostate @xmath0 , the phase space volume available to the system becomes fantastically enlarged ; it is then very  probable  that due to the random motion of particles belonging to the system , the initial microstate of the system will evolve to the newly available huge regions of phase space , most of which ( almost all ) pertain to a new macrostate @xmath1 ( new state of equilibrium ) .",
    "as the new volume of phase space is enormously larger than the initial one , it is then very  improbable  for the system to come back spontaneously to the beginning region of the phase space , i.e. from the macrostate @xmath1 to the macrostate @xmath0 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the above - mentioned reasoning , to some extent , counters the famous loschmidt s _ umkehreinwand _ ( _ reversibility objection_)@xcite pointing out that each trajectory in the phase space has its precise time - reversed counterpart .",
    "thus , preparing our system in the state @xmath1 , there is a is a fifty - fifty chance to find our system escaping from the state @xmath1 and going toward the state @xmath0 .",
    "the answer to this objection is that the volume of phase space belonging to the state @xmath1 is so huge that for `` overwhelmingly many '' starting points of these time - reversed trajectories , an enormously long time is required ( much exceeding the time of existence of our universe ) to encounter the macrostate @xmath0 occupying a very small volume in the phase space .",
    "then , the transition from the macrostate @xmath1 to the macrostate @xmath0 never occurs in our world .",
    "boltzmann s thoughts on the problem of the time arrow have withstood the test of time.@xcite however , the trouble is that this kind of argumentation is based on the comparison of respective volumes of phase space pertaining to some macrostates .",
    "the notion of `` probability '' defined in terms of the volumes of phase space is valid only for the states of equilibrium and can not be applied when the system is far from equilibrium , as it happens immediately after the constraints imposed on the system are released . in light of the loschmidt s question@xcite such",
    "a nonequilibrium situation still remains mysterious as to why from the two time - symmetric paths of the microstate evolution ( onward and backward in time ) chosen is always the one that leads to the time - asymmetric thermodynamic behavior of the statistical system ? to understand this problem , it is necessary to trace the evolution of a microstate more directly and find some reasons ( of statistical type ) that apply to the nonequilibrium states and decide about their one - time direction macroscopic evolution .",
    "the evolution of nonequilibrium states can be investigated by means of an analysis of stochastic processes for some simple models .",
    "the most famous is boltzmann s hard sphere gas model leading to h - theorem@xcite which formulated in 1872 gave rise to the discussion on the problem of the arrow of time . among the other examples",
    ", one can list the kac ring,@xcite the `` p and q molecules '' dynamics in the infinite plain,@xcite the lorentz gas@xcite and probably the best known the double - urn model invented by p. and t. ehrenfests@xcite and investigated further by other authors.@xcite for all these models , the one - time - direction behavior is obtained due to some reasonable probabilistic assumptions resembling the _ stosszahlansatz _ used for deriving h - theorem . unfortunately , thus far it has not been clearly demonstrated as to why these probabilistic assumptions do _ not _ apply to the time - reversed microstates.@xcite in other words , the _ stosszahlansatz _ and similar assumptions act in such a way that they select only one type of evolution ( this `` normal '' one ) and exclude the time - reversed one .",
    "actually , a simple explanation of how this selection comes about seems to be missing in the literature so this issue is now elucidated briefly .",
    "stosszahlansatz_-like assumptions have the general form of master equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the probability density function for particles being in the state @xmath4 .",
    "crucial is that : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the probability density function for particles being in states other than @xmath4 ( the symbol @xmath7 denotes the logical negation ) .",
    "the losses are proportional to @xmath3 because the more particles are in the state @xmath4 , the more of them can lose this state ( in the original boltzmann problem the particles in the state @xmath4 are due to collisions scattered out to another state ) . in turn ,",
    "the less particles are in the state @xmath4 ( then @xmath6 is large ) , the more of particles from these states different from @xmath4 can be transferred by means of collisions to the state @xmath4 .",
    "thus the gains are proportional to @xmath6 . as the result",
    ", the excess of particles being in @xmath4 is exterminated and the deficiency of such particles is augmented .",
    "this means that @xmath3 always evolves towards some equilibrium value @xmath8 .",
    "the differences @xmath9 diminish over time for any @xmath4 , so that the entire system exhibits a monotonic evolution towards an equilibrium state .",
    "the _ stosszahlansatz _ (  the collision number assumption  ) is often referred to as ",
    "the assumption about molecular chaos  .",
    "actually , the molecular chaos , or the lack of any correlations between particles is included into the _ stosszahlansatz _ by assuming that ( [ stos2 ] ) is true .",
    "the randomness of the statistical process means that the more we have the candidates for gains ( losses ) , the more gains ( losses ) actually happen .",
    "all candidates are equal and no special selection is accomplished .",
    "in other words , one can regard the validity of ( [ stos2 ] ) as a formal definition of the uncorrelated behavior of a statistical system . in case of any kind of correlation",
    ", we would not be able to assume the straightforward proportionality ( [ stos2 ] ) because the transitions between states would happen according to some special schema following the way the particles are correlated .    to demonstrate it more formally and explain how the time - asymmetry is included into the _ stosszahlansatz _ we introduce a simplest possible model where particles can assume only two states , that is @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "there are only two kinds of processes proceeding at the microscopic level : the particles change their state from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , or from @xmath13 to @xmath12 .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the time - reversed evolution we observe precisely the same kinds of transitions : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , in this case the description of the system evolution will be completely different .    first the  normal  behavior of the system , i.e. the evolution governed by the",
    "_ stosszahlansatz _ is considered . denoting @xmath16 and @xmath17 , according to ( [ stos1 ] ) and ( [ stos2 ] )",
    ", we have : @xmath18 the proportionality constant @xmath19 , representing the transition rates , is assumed to be the same both for gains and losses ( in the original boltzmann reasoning , the proportionality constant depends only on the scattering cross - section and is the same both for the direct and the time - reversed collisions ) .",
    "the equations ( [ stos3 ] ) can be easily solved and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "as expected , the system evolves to an equilibrium where @xmath20 .    if we define a function @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22 we find on the basis of ( [ stos3 ] ) that @xmath21 changes monotonically over time for any values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 ( the property that @xmath26 was used in deriving ( [ stos5 ] ) ) .",
    "the inequality ( [ stos5 ] ) follows from the fact that if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 and if @xmath29 , then @xmath30 .",
    "equality holds only when @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the system exhibits the one - time directional behavior which can be expressed as the law that @xmath21 never increases over time .",
    "let us consider the time - reversed evolution of the system .",
    "again , we deal with the same microscopic transitions of the form @xmath15 and @xmath14 but now the relations ( [ stos1 ] ) and ( [ stos2 ] ) are time - reversed and we have : @xmath32 or stating it explicitly for our model : @xmath33 however , consequences of ( [ stos3r ] ) are very weird .",
    "we pay our attention at the evolution of the number of particles in the state @xmath12 .",
    "although the state @xmath12 is gained by the particles that have been previously in the state @xmath13 , the number of the appropriate transitions @xmath14 ( the number of gains ) is by no means determined by the number of the candidates for such a transition , i.e. the particles in the state @xmath13 .",
    "the number of particles in the state @xmath13 appears to be completely unimportant as concerns the gains because the gains are now proportional to the number of particles in the state @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "it is actually an extraordinary behavior .",
    "there can be very small number of particles in the state @xmath13 and nonetheless we can have a large number of transitions @xmath14 due to a large density @xmath23 .",
    "it is equivalent to state that now we deal with a kind of correlation ; the transitions are not random , as it was for the  normal  evolution where they were proportional to @xmath24 ; however , are mysteriously controlled in such a way to be proportional to @xmath23 .    to learn more about discussion on the time arrow",

    "the advantage of the proposed approach is that it is not an artificial and merely heuristic model but it refers to real microscopic processes governed by the time - symmetric dynamics .",
    "the time arrow is shown for the development of an intuitive quantity such as the average kinetic energy of particles . moreover",
    ", the origin of the time - arrow can be easily demonstrated by referring to spatial distributions of the velocity vectors that should be satisfied for randomly moving particles before and after collisions .",
    "these distributions appear to be significantly different ( incompatible ) for the incoming and outgoing particles , which is crucial for understanding the one - time direction evolution of such a system .",

    "assumption is made that the particles of gases are hard - spheres that interact by means of elastic two - particles collisions . due to the collision of a particle @xmath34 with a particle @xmath35 ,",
    "the particle @xmath34 changes its velocity @xmath39 it possessed just before the collision into the velocity @xmath40 ; and similarly , the initial velocity @xmath41 of the particle @xmath35 changes into the velocity @xmath42 ( fig .

    "( [ vacvcm ] ) can be found in a slightly different form in ref .",
    "25 . in effect , eqs .",
    "( [ dek1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath62    if we consider many collisions that proceed in the statistical system within a time interval @xmath63 , we may expect that the chaotic motion of particles makes them completely uncorrelated before the collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) ,    i.e. for the particles interacting within the time @xmath63 we have : @xmath64 the average symbol , @xmath65 , means that the average is calculated over the _ colliding _ within @xmath63 particles ( not over the all particles in the gases ) .",
    "the property ( [ vv ] ) will be referred to as the symmetry @xmath66 .",
    "we notice that by defining the temperature as a quantity proportional to the average kinetic energy we ensure that despite the interacting gases are no longer in equilibrium their temperature is still well defined .",
    "now we estimate the velocity distribution after collisions and calculate @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the theory of elastic collisions of hard - spheres demonstrates that the differential scattering cross - section in the cm - system is independent of the scattering angle .",
    "it means that if we consider the particles with established velocities @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath69 and differing only in the impact parameter , the outgoing velocities @xmath45 and @xmath47 will be distributed in space in cm - systems completely isotropically ( fig . [ fig6 ] ) .    the average projection of these velocities on the velocity @xmath69 must then be zero : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the same refers to any subset of colliding within @xmath63 particles having established @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath69 .",
    "hence , we conclude that for all colliding particles holds : @xmath72 this property will be referred to as the symmetry @xmath73 .",
    "now , coming back to eq.([dek ] ) we find with help of the symmetries ( [ vv ] ) and ( [ uv ] ) that the change of the average energy of colliding particles is given by the simple expression : @xmath74 note that the equality @xmath75 was used in deriving ( [ de ] ) .",
    "if we assume@xcite that that the particles colliding within @xmath63 are representative for the whole particles of the gas @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( i.e. their average kinetic energy is the same as the average kinetic energy for the whole gas ) , then the average kinetic energy can be expressed by means of the gas temperature according to the relation @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the boltzmann constant . in effect",
    "( [ de ] ) becomes : @xmath79 note that the mutual interactions between the particles of the _ same _ gas are unimportant because , on the basis of eqs .",
    "( [ det ] ) , they depict no transfer of energy , thus could be neglected from the start .",
    "the averages in eqs .",
    "( [ det ] ) refer to the _ portions _ of gases that interacted within @xmath63 . to obtain the change of the average energy calculated with respect to the _ whole _ gas ( a or b ) , we introduce : @xmath80  number of all particles of a given gas ( @xmath81 or @xmath82 ) , @xmath83  number of colliding within @xmath63 pairs and @xmath84 - number of colliding pairs in a unit of time .",
    "then , the rate of the change of the average energy for the entire gas is : @xmath85 and using eq .",
    "( [ det ] ) we obtain : @xmath86 the above - mentioned analysis carried out on the microscopic level has led us to the macroscopic time - asymmetric _ heat conduction equation _ ( [ dete ] ) . in agreement with experiment ,",
    "the transfer of energy within @xmath63 is solely governed by the difference of the instantaneous temperatures @xmath36 and @xmath37 and proceeds with time only in one direction : the higher - temperature gas cools down and the lower - temperature gas warms up , but not _ vice versa_. from the theoretical point of view , this is a very non - trivial result .",
    "we also notice that the identification of the temperature with the average energy of particles acquires here an additional justification . according to the experimental definition of temperature , it is a quantity that is the same for two bodies in contact and in the state of equilibrium ( defined as zero flux of energy ) .",
    "this fact is precisely reproduced by our eqs .",
    "( [ dete ] ) .",
    "there is no energy transfer if the temperatures _ understood as the average kinetic energies _ are equal .    to express the achieved time - asymmetry in a concise and straightforward manner",
    ", we define an @xmath21 function as follows : @xmath87 its time derivative is given as : @xmath88 where we have used the following from eqs .",
    "( [ dete ] ) relation : @xmath89 , which is , of course , the energy conservation law .",
    "now , using explicitly eqs .",
    "( [ dete ] ) , we get : @xmath90 it is evident that for any instantaneous temperatures @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath91 and equality holds only when the gas temperatures are equal .",
    "the @xmath21 function changes monotonically with time and may be used to represent the one - time - direction macroscopic evolution of our statistical system .",
    "we then arrive at the boltzmann type h - theorem which is expressed here in terms of the instantaneous temperatures of gases .",
    "it is intriguing as to how the time - asymmetry was introduced into our reasoning so that it led us to the results ( [ dete ] ) and ( [ dhm0 ] ) .",
    "so far , we have considered time - symmetric collisions and no choice between onward and backward collisions has been explicitly made .",
    "it appears however that the time arrow was implicitly brought in by the statistical assumptions we named the symmetries @xmath92 and @xmath93 defined in ( [ vv ] ) and ( [ uv ] ) , respectively .",
    "namely , it should be noticed that the symmetry @xmath92 is ascribed to the _ incoming _ velocities , @xmath66 , and the symmetry @xmath93 refers to the _ outgoing _ velocities , @xmath73 .",
    "additionally , what is the most important , the symmetries @xmath92 and @xmath93 are _ incompatible _ when the temperatures @xmath36 and @xmath94 are different .",
    "this incompatibility ( which is proved in appendix ) means that the two symmetries can not be fulfilled at the same time by one and the same set of the velocity vectors .",
    "so that , if the initial velocities @xmath39 and @xmath95 fulfill the symmetry @xmath66 , they at the same time do _ not _ undergo the symmetry @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , as the final velocities @xmath40 and @xmath99 satisfy the symmetry @xmath73 , they do _ not _ exhibit the symmetry @xmath100 in the sense that @xmath101 . in brief , @xmath102",
    "now , imagine that we reverse in time the just considered statistical process of energy exchange between the two gases .",
    "then , at any time interval @xmath63 , we deal with exactly the same but time - reversed collisions processes proceeding according to the schema : @xmath103 the initial velocities have become the final ones and the originally outgoing velocities are now the incoming ones .",
    "the whole process is time reversed so that the energy transfer now proceeds in the opposite direction : energy flows from the gas with lower - temperature to the higher - temperature one .",
    "so the question arises : why such a process in fact never happens ?",
    "first we must notice that the time - reversed velocities @xmath104 and @xmath105 satisfy the same symmetries as the original velocities do because the _ time_-reversal does not influence the _ spatial _ symmetries @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it means that the symmetry @xmath106 ( i.e. that @xmath107 ) and the symmetry @xmath108 , which signifies that @xmath109 , are obviously valid .",
    "it also follows that the incompatibility relations ( [ incompat ] ) are correct for the time - reversed velocities as well : @xmath110 therefore , in the time reversed collisions , the  initial  velocities @xmath105 do not fulfill the symmetry @xmath92 , i.e. they exhibit a correlation : @xmath111 however , such a correlation is regarded as very improbable for the incoming velocities of randomly moving particles . here , we find the first reason why the considered time - reversed process never occurs .",
    "similarly , according to ( [ incompatrev ] ) , in the time reversed collisions the  final  velocities @xmath104 do not realize the symmetry @xmath93 , which means that the velocities @xmath112 are not isotropically distributed in space in cm - systems : @xmath113 this however is in contradiction with the scattering cross - section property for the hard spheres collisions with random impact parameters .",
    "again , the time - reversed collisions appear to exhibit behavior that is statistically very specific and can not be expected for the random motion of particles .    in summary , in the statistical system of two mixed gases ,",
    "the _ typical _ symmetry for the incoming velocities is the symmetry @xmath92 and for the outgoing ones it is the qualitatively different symmetry @xmath93 .",
    "such an assumption has led us to the experimentally confirmed result for the energy flow ( [ dete ] ) and the time asymmetric behavior of the @xmath21 function ( [ dhm0 ] ) . for the time - reversed process , the roles of the symmetries would have to be exchanged : the initial one would be @xmath93 and the final one @xmath92 .",
    "this , however , can not happen in realistic system of randomly moving objects .",
    "if the initial symmetry was the symmetry @xmath93 , it would mean that the incoming velocities are correlated ( the symmetry @xmath92 broken ) , which is highly improbable .",
    "similarly , if the final symmetry was @xmath92 , it would be equivalent to anisotropic distribution of the outgoing velocities in cm - systems ( the symmetry @xmath93 broken ) , which is unusual for randomly moving particles .",
    "in conclusion , we have made implicitly some important selection by assuming that the symmetries in our system change in time according to the order @xmath114 .",
    "we have discarded the ( dynamically acceptable ) microstates for which the order of the symmetries is inversed .",
    "this choice , we have made for statistical reasons , has ended up in the time - asymmetric final results ( [ dete ] ) and ( [ dhm0 ] )",
    ".    one may ask , what happens to the symmetry @xmath93 acquired by the particles due to collisions within the time interval @xmath63 . because in the consecutive time interval quite a _",
    "new _ representative subset of particles is chosen for the next collisions , the _ memory _ about the acquired earlier symmetry @xmath93 is lost .",
    "this new subset of particles again possesses before the collisions the initial symmetry @xmath92 ( not @xmath93 ) .",
    "next , within the new time interval @xmath63 , the symmetry @xmath92 is changed into the symmetry @xmath93 .",
    "and so on for the subsequent intervals @xmath115 and new subsets of colliding particles : @xmath116{{\\tiny $ \\delta t_1$}\\\\$\\longrightarrow$}s_2 \\;\\ ; { { \\wr}}\\ ; \\ ; s_1\\shortstack[c]{{\\tiny$\\delta t_2$}\\\\$\\longrightarrow$}s_2\\;\\ ; \\wr \\;\\;s_1\\shortstack[c]{{\\tiny $ \\delta t_3$}\\\\$\\longrightarrow$}s_2\\;\\ ; ... \\ ] ]    it is interesting to notice that in _ equilibrium _ the symmetries @xmath92 and @xmath93 are _",
    "compatible_. actually , if @xmath117 and the typical symmetries @xmath66 and @xmath73 are valid , then from eqs ( [ s1  ] ) and ( [ s2  ] ) follows that : @xmath118 we observe that in equilibrium , the initial and the final velocities undergo both the symmetry @xmath92 _ and _ the symmetry @xmath93 .",
    "so , the roles of the incoming and the outgoing particles may be plausibly exchanged and the time - reversed evolution is equally typical as the original one .",
    "both these behaviors are macroscopically indistinguishable and provide the same , equal to zero , transfer of energy between the gases .    finally , we notice that in our reasoning , we have applied a kind of  coarse - graining  with respect to the time . to expect that the subset of particles colliding within @xmath63 is representative for the entire gas , so that we can identify their average energy with the gas temperature , and that the averages defining the symmetries @xmath66 and @xmath73 are actually zero ( or very close to zero ) , we have to chose the time interval @xmath63 _ sufficiently large _ to ensure we deal with many collisions . if the time interval @xmath63 was too small , the anti - thermodynamic behavior ( i.e. fluctuations consisting in the heat transfer from the colder gas to the hotter one ) within such a short time - scale would be very probable . in this case , eq .",

    "then for each velocity the magnitude of @xmath44 and @xmath46 is calculated and a direction of @xmath123 and @xmath124 is randomly selected . in this way we get data representing @xmath83 collisions proceeding within a time @xmath63 and",

    "( [ dekaver ] ) . before the next step",

    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the more collisions @xmath83 is taken in the simulation step ( i.e. the longer is the time step @xmath63 ) , the rarer we encounter the anti - thermodynamic behavior when within the step the colder gas a cools down .",
    "such an anti - thermodynamic behavior is frequent for small samples of colliding pairs ( i.e. within short @xmath63 ) , which reflects the fact that the symmetries @xmath66 and @xmath73 are not satisfied for small subsets of particles and the difference of the average kinetic energies on the right side of eqs .",

    "although for many models proposed in the literature , the development of macroscopic quantities ( density , energy , etc . ) toward equilibrium was clearly demonstrated , so far , to our knowledge , no general analytical determinant controlling , at any moment , the evolution of the typical non - equilibrium microstate of realistic statistical system was provided .",
    "we believe that our work delivers some insight enabling a better understanding how the macroscopic time arrow emerges from the microscopic conditions suffered by particles .",
    "especially , it demonstrates why the innocuous reversal of particles velocities leads to very improbable velocity distribution that is never realized in normal situations .",
    "to show that the symmetries @xmath92 and @xmath93 are incompatible one has to express @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath69 by @xmath132 , @xmath133 and gets : @xmath134 it is clear that as long as @xmath135 , if @xmath136 ( the symmetry @xmath137 holds ) the left side of ( [ s1  ] ) can not be equal to zero , i.e. the symmetry @xmath138 is broken .",
    "the proof for the final velocities requires a bit more effort . using the definitions @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 we have : @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "note that we can not identify @xmath145 and @xmath146 with the average energy of the whole gases ( the subset of particles that just collided within the time interval @xmath63 is no longer representative for the whole gas ) and then the instantaneous temperatures can not be introduced at this stage . but using eqs ( [ s21 ] ) the relations ( [ dek ] ) can be written as : @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "after simple calculations we get from the last equations that : @xmath150 inserting it into eqs ( [ s21 ] ) we get : @xmath151 it is clear that if @xmath135 and the symmetries @xmath66 and @xmath152 are valid , then @xmath153 , i.e. the symmetry @xmath100 is broken .",
