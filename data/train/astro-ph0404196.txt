    "the gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted during the final stages of the coalescence of two merging black holes ( bhs ) carry linear momentum , implying that the center of mass of the system experiences a recoil ( bonnor & rotenberg 1961 ; peres 1962 ) .",
    "the resulting recoil velocity had been known to be large , with values estimated to be of order @xmath7 ( fitchett 1983 ) .",
    "favata et al . (",
    "2004 ) has recently revisited this problem and computed recoil velocities , treating the spin and orbital dynamics of the merging bhs , as well as the generation of gws in the strong gravity regime .",
    "they have found the range of possible recoil velocities to be @xmath8 , with the exact value depending on the mass ratio of the merging bhs , their spin , and orbital parameters .",
    "these velocities are large compared to the escape velocities of dwarf galaxies , and of the typical dark matter halos that existed at the early epochs of galaxy formation ( @xmath2 ) . in hierarchical cosmogonies , the smbhs that are known to exist in the local universe grew via a combination of accretion and mergers between holes residing in individual dm halos .",
    "merritt et al . ( 2004 ) and madau & quataert ( 2004 ) recently considered several consequences of a large recoil that removes a bh from the center of its host galaxy .",
    "in particular , merritt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) pointed out that the ejection of smbhs from the shallow potentials of dm halos at high redshift implies a maximum redshift at which the progenitors of present  day smbhs could have started merging ( and sticking ) with each other .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we consider the growth history of smbhs that are in place at @xmath4 , and are thought to power the bright quasars recently discovered ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ; 2001 ; 2003 ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . as discussed in haiman & loeb ( 2001 ; hereafter hl01 ) , relatively little time is available for the growth of these few @xmath9 smbhs prior to @xmath10 , and their seed bhs must be present as early as @xmath11 .",
    "a model in which stellar seed bhs appear in small progenitor dm halos is consistent with the presence of a @xmath12 smbh at @xmath11 , provided that each seed bh can grow at least at the eddington ",
    "limited exponential rate , and that the progenitor halos can form seed bhs sufficiently eary on .",
    "the ejection of a merger  product smbh from its host halo severely limits the ability of massive smbhs to grow at @xmath4 , by disrupting the early stages of growth . in this _ letter _",
    ", as an example , we model the growth of the smbh powering the most distant sdss quasar , sdss 1054 + 1024 at redshift @xmath13 , with an inferred bh mass of @xmath14 . under the assumption that progenitor holes are ejected from dm halos with velocity dispersions @xmath15 , and do not contribute to the final bh mass",
    ", we find that typical recoil velocities must either be below the _ minimum _ value @xmath16 found by favata et al . , or else this smbh must have had a phase during which it gained mass significantly more rapidly than the eddington  limited exponential growth rate would imply .",
    "the rest of this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in   [ sec : quasar ] , we discuss the inferred values of the relevant parameters ( halo and bh mass ) of sdss 1054 + 1024 . in   [ sec : model ] , we describe the method we use model the growth of the smbh by accretion and mergers . in   [ sec : results ] , we present our main result , showing that excluding seed bhs from low  mass progenitor halos",
    "necessitates a faster  than eddington growth rate . in   [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss various uncertainties about our results . in   [ sec : conclude ] , we summarize the implications of this work and offer our conclusions . , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , with a power spectrum normalization @xmath20 and slope @xmath21 ( spergel et al .",
    "the starting point for the constraints we derive below is simply the existence of a bh of mass @xmath22 at redshift @xmath23 , residing within a dark halo of mass @xmath24 .",
    "while the masses of smbhs at the centers of nearby galaxies can be directly estimated , the mass of the smbh powering the @xmath13 quasar sdss 1054 + 1024 is inferred indirectly from its observed luminosity . under the assumption that the quasar emits a fraction @xmath25 of the eddington luminosity , and using the template spectrum of elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to make a bolometric correction , in the case of sdss 1044 - 0125 , we find @xmath26 .",
    "given a sufficient fueling rate , bright quasars would naturally shine at their limiting luminosity , and we expect @xmath27 .",
    "there is no obvious signs of beaming or lensing in the spectrum of this quasar ( willott et al .",
    "2003 ) . indeed , the large observed size ( @xmath28 comoving mpc ; mesinger & haiman 2004 ) of its strmgren sphere makes it unlikely that the apparent flux of this quasar was significantly boosted by either lensing or beaming ( haiman & cen 2002 ) . in most conventional accretion models , @xmath29 , and the fiducial value of @xmath30 would be a lower limit to the actual bh mass",
    ". however , there are models with @xmath31 ; for example , in the recent `` photon bubble '' model of begelman ( 2002 ) , @xmath25 can be as high as @xmath32 , reducing the inferred bh mass .",
    "we next require the mass of the halo in which the quasar sdss 1054 + 1024 resides . as in the case of the bh mass , the halo mass , or the velocity dispersion ,",
    "can be directly measured for some nearby agns , but for distant quasars , we have to rely on indirect estimates .",
    "as described in hl01 , @xmath24 can be estimated based on the abundance of dark matter halos . in the case of the sdss quasar ,",
    "one bright quasar was found within a @xmath33 deg@xmath34 survey area . in order to match this abundance",
    ", we find the halo mass has to be @xmath35 , with a corresponding velocity dispersion of @xmath36 .",
    "this result is weakly sensitive to the assumed duty cycle of quasar activity .",
    "we here assume @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the usual radiative efficiency of accretion .",
    "we use the standard press ",
    "schechter mass function ( but find that our results would change little if we had instead adopted the recent numerical mass function in jenkins et al .",
    "2002 , or the improved semi  analytical mass function of sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "further details of the bh and halo mass determination are given in hl01 .",
    "a relation between bh mass and halo circular velocity was recently determined in a sample of nearby galaxies ( ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "while this local relation does not necessarily hold at higher redshifts , it is interesting to note that it is in good agreement with the bh mass and ( halo ) velocity dispersion our procedure yields for sdss 1054 + 1024 .",
    "finally , the inferred halo mass is consistent with the value of @xmath39 derived from the spectral signatures of cosmic infall for this source ( barkana & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "in order to model the growth of the smbh in our adopted @xmath40cdm cosmology , we rely on the merger history of dark matter halos in the extended press ",
    "schechter ( eps ) formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "we follow hl01 , and compute the central bh mass mirroring the assembly of its host halo .",
    "given a parent halo of total mass @xmath24 at redshift @xmath23 , the eps formalism specifies its average merger history back in redshift .",
    "every branch of such a merger tree represents a progenitor of the parent halo , whose mass is continuously growing by accreting , and by merging with other progenitors .    to keep our model simple , we assume that each progenitor of the parent halo develops a seed bh of mass @xmath41 when the progenitor grows above a critical size , corresponding to the velocity dispersion @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is a typical recoil velocity for a coalescing smbh binary .",
    "any seed bh that had appeared further up along the branch in the merger tree ( e.g. the remnants of the first stars ; abel et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ) are thus assumed to be ejected from the progenitor halo , and not to contribute to the final smbh mass at @xmath10 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , since in a typical `` merger tree '' , each progenitor halo had been continuously undergoing mergers with other progenitors .",
    "the expected recoil velocity depends on the mass  ratio of the merging bhs ; this dependence could be included in more detailed models of the merger tree , such as those utilizing monte - carlo realizations ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; menou et al .",
    "2001 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ; islam et al .",
    "once the progenitor halo has merged with several others , its potential well will be deep enough so that the ejected seed bh could fall back into this enlarged halo .",
    "however , the ejected bh will likely have traveled far beyond the virial radius of the enlarged halo : we find @xmath44 for @xmath11 and @xmath45 .",
    "madau & quataert ( 2004 ) recently considered the dynamics of a recoiling bh in the fixed potential of the host galaxy , and showed that for a density distribution with a steep stellar cusp , dynamical friction can cause the bh to return to the halo center within @xmath46 yrs .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that steep stellar cusps exist in the earliest proto ",
    "halos that are thought to form a single massive star at @xmath47 ( which , as we will see below , is the birth redshift for the seeds responsible for the bulk of the final smbh mass ) .",
    "we next assume that each individual seed bh subsequently grows exponentially by accretion , @xmath48 m_{\\rm seed}$ ] , where @xmath49 , as defined above , and @xmath50 is the time elapsed between the formation of the seed bh at redshift @xmath51 and a later redshift @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that eventually , by redshift @xmath23 , the smaller bhs in all progenitor halos coalesce together to form a single smbh at the center of the parent halo ( as long as the bh mergers are completed prior to redshift @xmath23 , we do not need to specify when they take place ) .",
    "the mass of the resulting smbh in the parent halo at redshift @xmath23 is the sum of the individual bhs , each of which has grown by a different amount :    @xmath52 , \\label{eq : mbh}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the number of seeded progenitors at redshift @xmath54 ,    @xmath55    here @xmath56 is the number of progenitors of mass @xmath57 at redshift @xmath58 of a halo whose mass at redshift @xmath23 is @xmath24 ( lacey & cole 1993 , eq . 2.15 ) , and @xmath59 is the mass of a halo whose velocity dispersion is @xmath60 .    to summarize , our model for the assembly of bhs has five parameters .",
    "two of these , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , describe the observed quasar sdss 1054 + 1024 , and have relatively small uncertainties , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the three parameters @xmath41 , @xmath38 , and @xmath43 relate to our model for the growth of the smbh .",
    "the fiducial values of these parameters are chosen as follows .",
    "the seed mass is @xmath61 , the typical value for a stellar remnant bh .",
    "vmos ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) can leave larger remnants , weighing up to @xmath62 ( heger et al . 2003 ) . the radiative efficiency is taken to be @xmath63 , based on the last stable orbit around a non  rotating bh .",
    "this value is consistent with a comparison of quasar light to remnant bh masses in nearby galaxies ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; aller & richstone 2002 ; haiman , ciotti & ostriker 2004 ) .",
    "a maximally rotating kerr bh would produce a larger value of @xmath64 .",
    "for any given values of the above five parameters , equation  [ eq : mbh ] can be used to compute @xmath65 . by requiring the predicted bh mass to equal the value inferred from observations ,",
    "this relation can be inverted , and our model then yields a unique prediction for @xmath43 as a function of the five parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath41 , @xmath38 , and @xmath22 .",
    "in our fiducial model , we find numerically that the maximum recoil velocity that allows the growth of the smbh in the quasar sdss 1054 + 1024 is @xmath66 .",
    "this value is significantly below the lowest values predicted by favata et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and merritt et al .",
    "if actual recoil velocities are in excess of @xmath67 , this would be inconsistent with the fiducial smbh growth model presented here , and would require that some of the seeds grow their mass faster than the assumed eddington rate .    in order to illustrate the bh growth process in our model in somewhat more detail , figure  [ fig : sdss ] shows the evolution of various quantities for sdss 1054 + 1024 ( this figure is an updated version of figure 1 in hl01 , which presented similar results for the earlier sdss quasar 1054 + 1000 at @xmath68 ) . in this figure , we have assumed @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . with this combination ,",
    "equations  [ eq : mbh ] and [ eq : nprog ] yield the required bh mass of @xmath71 at @xmath13 .",
    "the top left panel in figure  [ fig : sdss ] shows the number of progenitors of the parent halo ( @xmath35 ) whose velocity dispersion exceed @xmath72 . for reference ,",
    "the bottom left panel shows the corresponding minimum halo mass .",
    "going towards higher redshift , the number of progenitors increases , peaks at @xmath73 , and then decreases again as the typical progenitors are broken up into halos smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "the top right panel shows the contribution of progenitors from each redshift to the final black hole mass , and shows that the bulk of the bh mass is contributed by seed holes from @xmath74 .",
    "there are no new seeds forming at @xmath75 , and the peak redshift is considerably higher than the peak at which most progenitors form .",
    "this is simply because the increased time available between @xmath13 and increasingly higher redshifts @xmath23 ( shown explicitly in the bottom right panel ) makes the contribution from the first @xmath76 progenitors , forming at @xmath77 , dominant .",
    "we have found above that , in order to grow an smbh as massive as @xmath78 in our fiducial model , we would need to utilize progenitors with velocity dispersions as small as @xmath79 .",
    "these small halos , however , should be excluded from contributing to the final mass by the large recoil velocities .",
    "another way of stating our result is to note that in our fiducial model , but with @xmath80 or @xmath81 , corresponding to typical recoil velocities of @xmath82 or @xmath83 , the final smbh mass at @xmath13 is @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , respectively - an order of magnitude or more below the inferred bh mass of sdss 1054 + 1024 .",
    "in order to assess the sensitivity of the result above to our assumptions , we here vary each of the parameters of our model . for each combination of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath41 , and @xmath38 , we solve equation  [ eq : mbh ] with its left hand side set to @xmath87 , and the halo mass set to @xmath24 at @xmath13 , as discussed above .",
    "we further specify @xmath41 and @xmath38 , and then find @xmath88 by a newton  rhapson method .",
    "we find that our results are insensitive to the adopted values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "keeping all other parameters fixed at their fiducial values , increasing or decreasing @xmath24 by a factor of three yields @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "this is not surprising , and reflects the fact that the rare , massive halos at the tail of the mass function at @xmath13 have similar merging histories .",
    "similarly , increasing or decreasing @xmath25 by a factor of three , we find @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity to the value of the final bh mass is only logarithmic because of the exponential growth predicted in equation  [ eq : mbh ] .",
    "the sensitivity to the adopted value of the seed mass , @xmath41 , is the same as to @xmath25  changing the mass of the seeds or of the final bh is equivalent in our prescription , and @xmath38 have a small additional effect through the change they cause to the duty cycle , and hence to the inferred value of the halo mass . for sake of clarity",
    ", we chose here to neglect this effect , and parameterize the halo mass independently . ] since the model outlined above predicts the ratio @xmath93 .",
    "however , the seed mass is more uncertain than the inferred bh mass . once again keeping all the other parameters fixed at their fiducial values , we find that the choice of @xmath94 , and @xmath95 results in @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "indications from recent 3d simulations ( abel , bryan & norman 2000 , 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 1999 , 2002 ) are that the mass of the first , metal  poor stars are a few @xmath98 . nonrotating stars with masses between @xmath99 and above @xmath100 collapse directly into a bh without an explosion , whereas stars in the range @xmath101 explode without leaving a remnant ( heger et al .",
    "seeds as large as @xmath95 could only arise from the post",
    " newtonian instability of extremely massive stars .",
    "finally , the largest sensitivity of our result is to the value of @xmath38 .",
    "this is because @xmath38 directly enters the e  folding time for the growth of the bh mass in equation  [ eq : mbh ] .",
    "as an example , we find that the choice of @xmath102 , and @xmath103 result in @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "thus , if the growth of each seed bh is as rapid as it would be with a typical radiative efficiency of @xmath106 , the typical recoil velocities predicted by favata et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and merritt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) would still allow the build  up of the smbh in the @xmath13 quasar .",
    "note that in this case , most of the final black holes mass at @xmath13 would arise from the single most massive progenitor , starting to grow at @xmath107 .",
    "this is in contrast with our fiducial case with @xmath63 , which would imply that most of the bh mass was assembled by the addition of @xmath76 seeds , each of which started to grow at @xmath77 .",
    "a typical efficiency of @xmath106 would be significantly below the value obtained recently by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) .",
    "yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) compare the energy density in quasar light and the mass density of local smbhs ( sotan 1981 ) as a function of quasar luminosity .",
    "interestingly , they find that bright quasars ( with luminosities similar to that of sdss 1054 + 1024 , or bh masses of @xmath108 ) have a typical efficiency close to @xmath109 .",
    "this value is inferred only statistically , and therefore represents the average efficiency of the entire population of bright quasars at lower redshifts .",
    "our results suggests that such a high value can not hold for the past history of the individual source sdss 1054 + 1025 .",
    "the constraints obtained here could potentially be avoided if bh seeds at high redshift form only in a small fraction of the early dark matter halos ( madau & quataert 2004 ) . in this case ,",
    "when a dark matter halo , carrying a seed bh , merges with another dark halo , the seed bh would not experience a merger with another bh - it would then not be ejected , and it could continue to grow unimpeded . a small bh `` occupation fraction '' @xmath110 would make the predicted abundance of high-@xmath23 quasars rarer by a factor of @xmath110 , and the discovery of the @xmath10 sdss quasars could then be challenging to explain for @xmath111 .",
    "however , the fraction of dm halos harboring smbhs would be expected to increase over time , and @xmath112 could increase significantly between @xmath113 and @xmath10 ( menou et al .",
    "more detailed models , following the merger history of bhs ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; menou et al .",
    "2001 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ; islam et al .",
    "2003 ) , are needed to quantify this scenario .",
    "merging smbhs at @xmath2 can loose a non - negligible fraction of their total mass to gravitational waves , especially if they typically spin rapidly , and if they suffer a large number of mergers during their assembly history ( menou & haiman 2004 ) .",
    "more generally , although the mean expected recoil velocity is only weakly dependent on the bh spin ( favata et al .",
    "2004 ) , a high value for the typical spin of the merging bhs would strengthen our results through ( i ) the loss of the bh mass to gravity waves , and ( ii ) through the larger expected value of the radiative efficiency @xmath38 , increasing the accretion time - scale as @xmath114 .",
    "the recent discovery of luminous quasars at redshift @xmath4 provides evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbh ) as large as several @xmath9 were assembled during the first @xmath115 of the current age of the universe . in the context of hierarchical structure formation scenarios , these early smbhs grow via accretion and mergers of seeds that appear at much earlier epochs , @xmath113 . unless the growth by accretion of individual seed bhs is significantly faster than eddington  limited accretion at a fiducial radiative efficiency of @xmath116 , we find that such scenarios appear inconsistent with the large recoil velocities , @xmath117 , that were recently calculated to occur during the coalescence of massive bhs .",
    "a natural resolution of this discrepancy would be for individual smbhs to grow in mass at significantly super  eddington rates . in this case",
    ", the smbhs can arise from seeds that appear relatively more recently , ( i.e. closer to redshift @xmath10 , where the bright quasars exist ) , in dm halos whose potential wells are deep enough to retain these seeds despite their recoil . forthcoming instruments , such as the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ in the infrared , or deep radio instruments , such as the _ allen telescope array ( ata ) _ , _ extended very large array ( evla ) _ , and the _ square kilometer array ( ska ) _ , whose sensitivities allow them to detect bhs as small as @xmath95 at @xmath11 ( see haiman & quataert 2004 for a recent review ) would be able to shed light on whether or not the seeds of @xmath10 quasar black holes indeed extend out to these redshift ."
