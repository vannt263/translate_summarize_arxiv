    "recently we carried out analyses  @xcite based on the extended optical model  @xcite , in which the optical potential consists of the energy independent hartree - fock potential and the energy dependent complex polarization potential that has two components , i.e. , the direct reaction ( dr ) and fusion parts , which we call the dr and fusion potentials , respectively . in the original work based on the extended optical model  @xcite , use was made of a usual woods - saxon potential for the hartree - fock part of the potential , but in refs .",
    "@xcite , we started using the double folding potential  @xcite .",
    "the main interest in the studies of refs .",
    "@xcite was the normalization constant @xmath5 introduced earlier to reproduce the elastic scattering data for loosely bound projectiles such as @xmath6li and @xmath7be ; in the analysis of data for such loosely bound projectiles using the usual optical model with a folding potential  @xcite one was forced to reduce the strength of the folding potential by a factor @xmath8 in order to reproduce the data .",
    "this reduction factor was later ascribed to the strong breakup character of the projectiles .",
    "studies were made on the effects of the breakup on the elastic scattering , based on the coupled discretized continuum channel ( cdcc ) method  @xcite .",
    "these studies were very successful in reproducing the elastic scattering data without introducing any arbitrary normalization factors and further in understanding the physical origin of the factor @xmath8 needed in one channel optical model calculations .",
    "the authors of refs .  @xcite projected their coupled channel equations to a single elastic channel equation and deduced the polarization potential arising from the coupling with the breakup channels .",
    "the resultant real part of the polarization potential was then found to be repulsive at the surface region around the strong absorption radius , @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the reduction of the folding potential by a factor of @xmath8 needed in the one - channel optical model calculation is to effectively take into account the effects of the coupling with the breakup channels .",
    "we explored this problem for the @xmath6li  @xcite , @xmath10li  @xcite and @xmath7be  @xcite induced scattering and fusion in the framework of the extended optical model with the double folding potential .",
    "simultaneous @xmath0 analyses of the elastic scattering and fusion cross section data were performed to determine the two types of the polarization potentials as functions of the incident energy @xmath11 .",
    "our expectation was that the resulting real part of the dr potential would become repulsive consistently with the results of the ccdc calculations .",
    "we have indeed obtained repulsive real dr polarization potentials  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that both dr and fusion potentials satisfied the dispersion relation  @xcite separately .    in the present study",
    ", we extend the work of refs .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system .",
    "since @xmath1c is a tightly bound projectile , such an anomalous normalization constant @xmath12 observed in @xmath6li or @xmath7be induced scattering is not expected around the coulomb barrier energies .",
    "in fact , the normalization factor @xmath5 for reproducing the @xmath1c projectile data was found to be close to unity , @xmath13 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in sec .",
    "ii , we first discuss characteristic features of elastic scattering cross section data of @xmath1c+@xmath2pb  @xcite in comparison with those of @xmath6li induced scattering . from this comparison",
    "it will be shown that the dr cross section is expected to be significantly smaller in @xmath1c+@xmath2pb than in @xmath6li or @xmath7be induced reactions . in sec .",
    "iii , we then generate the so - called semi - experimental dr cross section , @xmath14 , by using the elastic scattering data together with the fusion cross section data  @xcite by following the method described in , e.g. , ref .",
    "the data of @xmath14 is needed in making the separate determination of the dr and fusion potentials in the extended optical model .",
    "simultaneous @xmath0 analyses of the data of the elastic scattering , fusion and semi - experimental dr cross sections are then carried out in sec .",
    "iv , where the results are also presented .",
    "section v concludes the paper .",
    "we begin with the discussion of some characteristic features of the elastic scattering cross section @xmath15 data of @xmath1c+@xmath2pb in comparison with those of @xmath6li , @xmath10li and @xmath7be induced scattering  @xcite .",
    "such features can best be seen in the ratio , @xmath16 , defined by @xmath17 as a function of the distance of the closest approach @xmath18 ( or the reduced distance @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 is the coulomb scattering cross section , while @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is related to the scattering angle @xmath21 by @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the distance of the closest approach in a head - on collision . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass and charge of the projectile and target ions , respectively , and @xmath26 is the incident energy in the center - of - mass system . @xmath16 as defined by eq .",
    "( [ p_e ] ) will be referred to as the elastic probability .    in figs",
    ".  [ pe - value ] ( a ) and  [ pe - value ] ( b ) , we present the experimental values of @xmath16 for incident energies available around the coulomb barrier energy as a function of the reduced distance @xmath19 for @xmath1c+@xmath2pb  @xcite and @xmath6li+@xmath2pb  @xcite systems , respectively . the latter case is presented as an example of @xmath16 for a loosely bound projectile . as seen , the values of @xmath16 at different energies line up to form a very narrow band for both cases .",
    "this is a characteristic feature observed in many of the heavy - ion collisions , reflecting the semiclassical nature of the collisions .",
    "@xmath16 remains close to unity until the two ions approach each other at around @xmath27 , where @xmath16 begins to fall off .",
    "the distance @xmath28 is usually called the interaction distance , at which the nuclear interactions between the colliding ions are switched on , so to speak .",
    "the values of @xmath28 are about 1.65  fm for @xmath1c+@xmath2pb and 1.9  fm for @xmath6li+@xmath2pb .",
    "the fall off of the @xmath16 value in the region immediately next to @xmath28 is due to dr .",
    "the fact that the @xmath28-value of 1.9  fm for @xmath6li+@xmath2pb is much larger than @xmath29  fm for @xmath1c+@xmath2pb implies that dr starts to take place in @xmath6li+@xmath2pb at larger distances than it does in @xmath1c+@xmath2pb .",
    "further it is seen that the amount of decrease of the @xmath16 value from unity in @xmath6li+@xmath2pb is significantly larger than in @xmath1c+@xmath2pb in the region of @xmath30  fm , where dr takes place .",
    "these features clearly indicate that dr ( which may be dominated by breakup ) takes place significantly more strongly in @xmath6li+@xmath2pb than in @xmath1c+@xmath2pb .",
    "this is indeed the case as seen from the semi - experimental dr cross section extracted in the next section .",
    "finally , we note that in the region of @xmath31  fm where fusion dominates , the values of @xmath16 for @xmath1c+@xmath2pb and @xmath6li+@xmath2pb become almost identical , implying that there may not be much difference in the absorption rates of both systems when these colliding nuclei approach each other as close as @xmath31  fm .",
    "in fact , the @xmath16 value becomes 0.1 for both cases at approximately @xmath32  fm .",
    "for our purpose of determining the fusion and dr potentials separately , it is desirable to have the data of dr cross sections in addition to fusion and elastic scattering cross sections . for the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system , however , no reliable data of the dr cross section are available , although some efforts have been devoted to measure the inelastic and transfer reaction cross sections  @xcite . here",
    ", we thus generate the so - called semi - experimental dr cross section @xmath14 , following the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    our method to generate @xmath14 resorts to the well known empirical fact that the total reaction cross section @xmath33 calculated from the optical model fit to the available elastic scattering cross section data , @xmath34 , usually agrees well with the experimental @xmath33 , in spite of the well known ambiguities in the optical potential .",
    "let us call @xmath33 thus generated the semi - experimental reaction cross section @xmath35 .",
    "then , @xmath14 can be generated by @xmath36 this approach seems to work even for loosely bound projectiles , as demonstrated by kolata _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the @xmath6he+@xmath37bi system .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we first carry out rather simple optical model @xmath0 analyses of elastic scattering data solely for the purpose of deducing @xmath35 . for these preliminary analyses",
    ", we assume the optical potential to be the sum of @xmath38+@xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath38 is the real , energy independent bare folding potential discussed in sec .",
    "b , @xmath39 is an energy independent short range imaginary potential discussed in sec .",
    "iv . a , and @xmath40 is a woods - saxon type complex potential with common geometrical parameters for both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the elastic scattering data are then fitted with a fixed radius parameter @xmath41 for @xmath40 , treating , however , three other parameters , the real and the imaginary strength @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the diffuseness parameter @xmath44 , as adjustable .",
    "the @xmath0 fitting is done for three choices of the radius parameter ; @xmath41=1.3 , 1.4 , and 1.5 fm .",
    "these different choices of the @xmath41-value are made to examine the dependence of the resulting @xmath35 on the value of @xmath45 .    as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the values of @xmath35 thus extracted for three different @xmath41 values agree with the average value of @xmath46 within 3% , implying that @xmath35 is determined without much ambiguity .",
    "we then identified the average values as the final values of @xmath35 . using thus determined @xmath35 , we generated @xmath14 by employing eq .",
    "( [ sig_d ] ) .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath35 and @xmath14 are presented in table  [ semiexp ] , together with @xmath47 . in table",
    "[ semiexp ] , given are also @xmath35 determined in ref .",
    "@xcite from the optical model calculations .",
    "the two sets of @xmath35 determined independently agree within 6% except for the lowest energy case of @xmath4855.7  mev where the discrepancy amounts to 25% .",
    "however , at this energy the value of the cross section is very small , and thus @xmath35 determined from the elastic scattering data has a relatively large uncertainty .",
    "[ semiexp ]    .semi - experimental total reaction and dr cross sections for the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as already remarked in sec .",
    "iv.d , the real and the imaginary parts of both dr and fusion polarization potentials determined from the present @xmath0 analyses satisfy the dispersion relation  @xcite separately .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the case of the @xmath6li+@xmath2pb system the threshold anomaly as was observed in heavy ion collisions involving strongly bound projectiles  @xcite were distinctly seen only in the fusion potential ; the values of the dr potential changes with energy much more slowly than those of the fusion potential .",
    "now , for the present case of @xmath1c+@xmath2pb , fig .",
    "4 shows that the values of @xmath49 are smaller than those of @xmath50 by about ten times .",
    "however , a somewhat different picture emerges if one plots the values of the imaginary parts of the dr and fusion potentials at a strong absorption radius @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ potential ] ( a ) , plotted are the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , together with the sum , @xmath54 , assuming @xmath55  fm . in fig .",
    "[ potential ] ( b ) , we also show for the sake of comparison the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58  fm for the @xmath6li+@xmath2pb system obtained with the dispersive potentials of ref .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ potential ] ( a ) that the magnitudes of @xmath52 are now comparable with those of @xmath53 and that @xmath52 increases as much rapidly as @xmath53 does with almost the same threshold energies .",
    "we can also see that @xmath53 is larger than @xmath52 around the coulomb barrier energy for the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system , which is consistent with the ratio @xmath59 shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the sum @xmath54 of @xmath52 and @xmath53 increases rapidly as typically observed for strongly bound projectiles  @xcite . in contrast to the above features of @xmath54 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system , those of the @xmath6li+@xmath2pb system are very different ; first of all , as seen in fig .",
    "[ potential ] ( b ) , @xmath60 and the total @xmath54 is dominated by @xmath52 , which is again consistent with the ratio @xmath59 in fig .  2 , and thus @xmath61 over the whole energy range considered .",
    "simultaneous @xmath0 analyses are made for the elastic scattering and fusion cross section data for the @xmath1c+@xmath2pb system at near - coulomb - barrier energies based on the extended optical model approach in which the polarization potential is decomposed into direct reaction ( dr ) and fusion parts .",
    "use is made of the double folding potential as a bare potential .",
    "it is found that the experimental elastic scattering and fusion data are well reproduced without introducing any normalization factor for the double folding potential and also that both dr and fusion parts of the polarization potential determined from the @xmath0 analyses satisfy separately the dispersion relation .",
    "moreover , it is found that the imaginary parts of both fusion and dr potentials at the strong absorption radius show rapid energy variation around the coulomb barrier energy which is typical for tightly bound projectiles  @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with those for the @xmath6li+@xmath2pb system involving a loosely bound projectile @xmath6li .",
