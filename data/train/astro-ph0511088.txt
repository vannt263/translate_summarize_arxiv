    "most x - ray transients , whether be / x - ray binaries or low mass x - ray binaries ( having either neutron star or black hole companions ) , display outbursts typically lasting from a few weeks to months . such durations are compatible with viscous timescales in a typical accretion disc . fast outbursts , with much shorter durations , must be due to a completely different physical mechanism . here",
    "we have shown that at least a fraction of the recurrent fast x - ray transients are associated with luminous ob stars , suggesting that the mass transfer mechanism feeding the accreting compact object is a radiative wind , and therefore have identified the class of sfxts .",
    "we must note that not every source displaying short x - ray outbursts may be assigned to the class of sfxts .",
    "flare stars and rs cvn binaries display short x - ray flares and superbursts from low mass x - ray binaries have similar durations , though rather different luminosities and lightcurves ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hmxb 1a0535@xmath3668 , in the lmc , has shown very bright x - ray outbursts lasting only a few days , but these outbursts are locked in phase with the orbital period of the system and may be related to periastron passage in a very eccentric orbit ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "igr  j00370 + 6122 could be a similar system @xcite .",
    "the black hole transient v4641  sgr should not be grouped with sfxts either . in this system ,",
    "the mass donor is a b9iii giant @xcite , which is not a massive star and can not have a radiative wind .",
    "moreover , its 1999 outburst was highly super - eddington and accompanied by a huge optical brightening , properties that set it completely apart from sfxts @xcite .    however , there are strong reasons to believe that the class of sfxts comprises a much larger number of sources than the five objects described above . in section  [ sec",
    ": others ] , we list four reliable candidates , but other known sources might belong to this class . for example , the x - ray transient igr  j11215@xmath35952 was observed by _",
    "integral _ during the decaying phase of an outburst .",
    "it is likely to be related to sfxts if its association to the b1ia supergiant hd  306414 is confirmed ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "if only some of these candidates are confirmed , the number of sfxts would already be comparable to that of classical sgxbs .",
    "we must consider , however , that classical sgxbs are persistent bright x - ray sources , while sfxts are transient sources with very short duty cycles .",
    "most of them are detectable , unless directly pointed at by _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ , only for a few hours every several months .",
    "it is hence not surprising that most of the sfxts so far found lie on the vicinity of the galactic centre , a region extensively monitored by _",
    "integral _ and other satellites .",
    "but , if sfxts are very difficult to detect , and we already know several of them in the region around the galactic centre , the implication is that the population of sfxts in the galaxy is much larger than the ten or so objects already known . as a matter of fact ,",
    "it is difficult to avoid concluding that most binaries containing a supergiant and a compact object * must * be sfxts or entirely quiescent .",
    "if we take into account the large number of obscured persistent hmxbs that _ integral _ is discovering , it seems clear that the numbers of hmxbs must have been severely underestimated .",
    "the physical reason for fast outbursts is still unknown .",
    "@xcite speculated that the outbursts in cyg x-1 could be due to some form of discrete mass ejection from the supergiant donor .",
    "@xcite also suspects that wind variability is the cause of fast outbursts .",
    "as we have shown here , an important fraction of fast transients have supergiant companions and at least three classical sgxbs have shown fast outbursts .",
    "it seems then that the fast outbursts are related to the mass transfer mode , wind accretion .",
    "they can not be related to the nature of the companion , as they are seen in black hole systems ( cyg x-1 ) , slow x - ray pulsars ( igr j16465@xmath34507 ) and faster x - ray pulsars ( ax j1841.0@xmath30536 ) .",
    "there is increasing evidence suggesting that the winds of b - type supergiants are highly structured and may have a fundamentally clumpy nature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if these clumps survive to the distance at which the compact object is orbiting , they could give rise to sudden episodes of increased accretion rate .",
    "alternatively , the outbursts could be related to the instability believed to be intrinsic to the wind accretion process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , there is nothing in the optical properties of sfxts setting them apart from classical sgxbs .",
    "it is therefore difficult to understand why their quiescent x - ray luminosities are rather lower .",
    "a possibility would be that sfxts have wider orbits than sgxbs , and the compact object ( in most cases , a neutron star ) accretes from a less dense environment .",
    "this , however , would not explain why the sources spend some ( still not quantified ) fraction of time below detectability .",
    "if highly eccentric , wide orbits are invoked in order to explain the periods of very low x - ray luminosity , one would navely expect some ( quasi-)periodicity in the recurrence of the outbursts , that has not been observed , as they would have to occur always relatively close to periastron .    clearly ,",
    "a more complete investigation of all the sources presented here is needed before common trends start to emerge and a characterisation of the group of sfxts can be achieved .",
    "understanding the reasons for their x - ray behaviour and the source of the difference with classical sgxbs will undoubtedly increase our knowledge of the accretion process and very likely provide valuable insights into the different paths leading to the formation of hmxbs and their subsequent evolution .",
