    "one way to select a winner of the election is to look for a most `` popular '' committee : a committee with the highest proportion of voter `` approval '' .",
    "( in case of ties , there may be more than one most popular committee . )",
    "we must make this notion precise .",
    "let us say that a voter _ approves _ a committee if it contains the list of @xmath2 candidates that the voter submitted .",
    "note that a voter may approve several committees , since several different @xmath0-element subsets will contain a given @xmath2-element subset if @xmath5 .",
    "we wish to answer questions regarding whether it is always possible , assuming certain conditions on the voters preferences , to find a committee approved by a certain proportion of voters",
    ". phrased another way , we can ask how popular is a most popular ( most - approved ) committee ?",
    "can we make any minimal guarantees for the approval proportion of a most popular committee , given some geometric condition on the voter preferences ?",
    "such questions have been addressed in voting contexts where each person is choosing just one candidate .",
    "berg et  al .",
    "@xcite initiated the study of _ agreeability conditions _ for voting preferences over a linear political spectrum .",
    "in this situation , candidates are chosen from a line of possibilities , and each person is allowed to specify an interval of candidates that they find acceptable .",
    "in other words , their _ approval set _ is an interval in the real line .",
    "they call a society _ super - agreeable _ if every pair of voters has a mutually agreed candidate ( i.e. , their approval sets overlap ) and they also consider other _ agreeability",
    "_ conditions that specify ways in which voter preferences , when taken in small subsets , are locally similar .",
    "they show how these produce global conclusions about how popular a most popular candidate must be , and give minimal guarantees for how many approval sets a most - approved candidate must lie in .",
    "these ideas have been generalized to other kinds of geometric spaces that can be viewed as political spectra ",
    "circles @xcite , trees @xcite , multi - dimensional spaces @xcite  as well as other kinds of approval sets @xcite and agreeability conditions @xcite .",
    "this paper considers similar questions in a new context : voting for committees .",
    "( see @xcite for several different approaches to the study of voting for committees . )",
    "the set of @xmath1 candidates is finite , and not viewed as a geometric space .",
    "however , voters are now allowed to specify a list of size @xmath2 , and there is a geometric notion of how close two lists may be .",
    "the resulting geometric space of lists is called a _ johnson graph _",
    "@xmath6 where each point is a @xmath2-element subset of an @xmath1-element set ( see @xcite for more on johnson graphs ) .",
    "unlike the context of berg  et  al .",
    "@xcite , here the space in which preferences are expressed is _ different _ from the space of potential outcomes of an election , which are the @xmath0-element subsets of the candidates , and which can be thought of in terms of the graph @xmath7 . in particular",
    ", each voter s list in @xmath6 produces an approval set in @xmath7 consisting of all committees that contain the list . in this paper , we ask : what is the minimal guarantee for the popularity of a most popular committee in @xmath7 , and if we place conditions on how similar , or `` agreeable '' , the submitted lists are in @xmath6 , how does that change the guarantee ?",
    "we first demonstrate , in theorem [ firstprop ] , a sharp lower bound for any voter distribution .",
    "we then show , in theorem [ theorem ] , that if all the votes lie within a `` ball '' in the space of lists , then the bound we can guarantee improves .",
    "we conclude with some extensions and open questions .",
    "let us identify the candidates with the elements of the set @xmath8 = \\{1,2 , \\ldots n\\}$ ] .",

    "any @xmath0-element subset of @xmath8 $ ] will be called a _ committee_.    we choose to think of given voter data as a probability distribution @xmath9 on the set of lists , which we call the _",
    "voter distribution_. in particular , this distribution will specify for each list @xmath10 the _ voting proportion _",
    "@xmath11this is the fraction of voters who submitted the list @xmath10 .",
    "we shall use the same notation to describe the probability of a collection of lists , so that @xmath12 describes the likelihood that a voter chose one of the lists in the collection @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 is a committee , let @xmath15 denote the _ approval proportion _ of committee @xmath14 with respect to voter data @xmath9 : this is the fraction of voters that approve a given committee if the voter distribution on the set of all lists is @xmath9 .",
    "we will write simply @xmath16 if @xmath9 is understood .",
    "assume that candidates 1 through 7 are being considered for a 4-person committee , and voters are asked to submit lists of three candidates .",

    "( then @xmath23 for all other lists . )",
    "for this choice of @xmath9 , the list @xmath24 has the highest voting proportion , but by inspection , we see that @xmath25 , which is a higher approval proportion than any other committee .",
    "this example shows that a most popular committee is not necessarily populated by candidates who are most popular . even though each of candidates 1 through 3 appears in @xmath26 of the submitted lists , and candidates 4 through 7 each appear in only @xmath27 of the submitted lists , the committee @xmath28 is still the most popular .",
    "our first observation is straightforward ; it gives a minimum popularity for a most popular committee .",
    "the proof also illustrates a technique that we will exploit again later  that a most popular committee has at least as large an approval proportion than the _ average _ approval proportion over all committees .",
    "[ firstprop ] for any given voter distribution @xmath9 , there exists a committee @xmath29 with approval proportion satisfying @xmath30    if we sum the approval proportions over all @xmath31 possible committees for @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath32 , |c|=k } \\pi ( c )   & = & \\sum_{c \\subseteq [ n ] , |c|=k }    \\left ( \\sum_{\\ell \\subseteq c , |\\ell|=j } p(\\ell ) \\right ) \\\\ & = & \\binom{n - j}{k - j } \\sum_{\\ell \\subseteq [ n ] , |\\ell| = j } p(\\ell ) \\\\ & = & \\binom{n - j}{k - j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first equality follows from the definition of the approval proportion .",
    "the second equality follows by noting that each list @xmath10 will be satisfied by the @xmath33 committees that include @xmath10 as a subset ; hence the term @xmath11 will appear @xmath33 times if we sum over lists , then committees . and",
    "the third equality is a consequence of @xmath9 being a probability distribution .",
    "since there are @xmath31 terms in the sum , at least one committee @xmath34 must have approval proportion @xmath35 at least as large as the average : @xmath36    notice that this bound is the best possible , since it is achieved by , for example , the uniform distribution on the set of all lists .",
    "we now investigate what characteristics of the voter distribution might improve the popularity of a most approved committee .",
    "for instance , in theorem [ firstprop ] , the worst possible case is one in which the distribution is `` spread out '' over all possible lists uniformly .",
    "but if the voters are `` agreeable '' in some sense then we might be able to guarantee a committee that will be approved by more voters .",
    "as an example , if we knew that all of the voters lists were `` close '' , then this would suggest that the approval proportion of a most popular committee should be higher than the bound in theorem [ firstprop ] .",
    "how can we can describe the `` closeness '' of votes ?",
    "consider the _ johnson graph _ @xmath6 , whose vertices are the @xmath2-sets ( i.e. , @xmath2-element subsets ) of @xmath8 $ ] , with two @xmath2-sets @xmath37 and @xmath38 adjacent if they have exactly @xmath39 elements in common . in our context , we think of the johnson graph as the space of possible lists , with two lists adjacent if they differ by exactly one candidate . then note that the graph distance @xmath40 in @xmath6 has a nice interpretation : for two lists @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the distance @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 differ in exactly @xmath43 places .",

    "what follows , we assume that @xmath49 so that the johnson graph has diameter at least 2 , and neighborhoods of vertices can be proper subsets of the set of vertices .",
    "figure [ fig : johnsongraph ] , though a small example , gives some helpful intuition concerning the structure of johnson graphs .",
    "we will examine _ rings _ of lists in @xmath6 that are equidistant from @xmath37 .",
    "more formally , define the _ ring _ @xmath50 by @xmath51 for @xmath52 , which may be thought of as the ring of radius @xmath45 about the vertex @xmath37 .",
    "we note that if @xmath53 , then the list @xmath54 must have @xmath55 candidates in common with the list @xmath37 , and @xmath45 candidates different from @xmath37 . thus @xmath56 , if @xmath57 , the rings are : @xmath58    [ ex : betterbound ] let @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . theorem [ firstprop ]",
    "implies that for any @xmath9 , there will always be a committee @xmath34 satisfying @xmath62 .",
    "now let @xmath63 and assume that @xmath9 is supported on the ball @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "then the complementary probability is @xmath66 hence , since one of the summands must be at least as large as the average , @xmath67 for some @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "then for @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 in fact , if @xmath72 and @xmath9 is distributed uniformly on @xmath73 , then the inequality in is equality , and @xmath74 is the highest approval proportion for any committee .",
    "so in this case , with the added assumption that @xmath9 is supported on @xmath64 , we can improve the lower bound on @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "( this will also be a consequence of theorem [ theorem ] below . )",
    "rings about a vertex @xmath37 always follow the same pattern : as @xmath45 increases from 0 to @xmath77 , the rings increase in size monotonically for a time , then decrease monotonically for a time",
    ". in particular , we can show :    @xmath78 holds if and only if @xmath79    a straightforward calculation using ( [ rrv ] ) shows that both conditions are equivalent to the condition @xmath80 .",
    "it is helpful to visualize the johnson graph as points on a sphere , with the list @xmath37 at the north pole , and the rings @xmath50 drawn as latitude lines .",
    "( this visualization explains our terminology and captures the behavior of the relative sizes of the rings . )",
    "suppose the voter distribution @xmath9 is supported on a neighborhood @xmath81 of radius @xmath82 . to find a minimal guaranteed approval proportion , we are interested in the worst - case scenario  the distribution that leads to a worst possible `` best '' committee .",
    "intuitively , we would expect this worst - case scenario to occur when the voters lists are spread out as far away from @xmath37 as possible , i.e. , on the ring @xmath83 .",
    "however , if @xmath82 is too large , the outermost ring @xmath83 will be too small , and votes on that ring will be too close together . in that case , the worst - case scenario will result from a more complicated distribution of voters .",
    "[ ex : ringexample ] let @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , and let @xmath63 .",
    "in example [ ex : betterbound ] , we showed that if the voter distribution @xmath9 is supported on @xmath64 , then there must be a committee @xmath14 with @xmath84 .",
    "as stated there , if @xmath9 is in fact the uniform distribution on @xmath73 , then every committee @xmath14 that contains all of @xmath37 has @xmath85 , and @xmath76 is the maximum approval proportion in this case .",
    "moreover , if @xmath86 , then the discussion in example [ ex : betterbound ] shows that one of the committees that contains @xmath37 will have an approval proportion strictly larger than @xmath76 .",
    "thus the `` worst - case '' scenario occurs only when @xmath9 is supported on the outermost ring @xmath73 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath9 were supported on @xmath87 , then the worst - case scenario can not result from @xmath9 being supported only on @xmath88 . because @xmath89 , the previous example shows that at least one committee @xmath14 would have @xmath84 if @xmath9 were supported on @xmath88 .",
    "however , if @xmath9 is the uniform distribution on @xmath87 , then it may be checked that the largest approval proportion for any committee is @xmath90 . in general",
    ", we expect that the worst - case scenario will occur when @xmath9 is supported on @xmath83 only when @xmath82 is small .",
    "we begin by showing that the rings , aside from being helpful in visualizing the neighborhood @xmath81 , are also quite important to our analysis . we define a _ concentric distribution centered at @xmath37 _ to be a distribution @xmath9 such that , for any @xmath45 and for any two lists @xmath91 and @xmath92 in @xmath50 , the proportion of voters choosing @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the same : @xmath93 .",
    "that is , the votes for lists in a given ring are distributed uniformly on that ring .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the _ weight _ of the ring @xmath50 : it is the sum of the voting proportions of elements of the ring @xmath50 .",

    "[ lem : ringlemma ] for any voting data @xmath9 , let @xmath95 represent the concentric distribution centered at @xmath37 that has the same weights as @xmath9 . then if @xmath14 is a committee with the highest approval proportion @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is a committee with the highest approval proportion @xmath98 , then @xmath99    in other words , uniformizing the voter distribution concentrically over the rings centered at @xmath37 can only decrease the popularity of a most popular committee .",
    "we will treat the weights as fixed for now , and partition the set of committees into classes by the number of elements a committee differs from the central list @xmath37 .",
    "we ll show that the approval proportion @xmath100 dominates @xmath101 in each class .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the set of committees that differ from the list @xmath37 in exactly @xmath43 candidates , i.e. , @xmath43 candidates are `` missing '' .",

    "note that @xmath105 , because any @xmath0-person committee in @xmath102 is missing @xmath106 candidates , including by construction exactly @xmath43 candidates in @xmath37 .",
    "we also see @xmath107 , since @xmath37 has only @xmath2 candidates .",
    "every committee belongs to exactly one @xmath102 for some @xmath43 , and there are @xmath108 committees in @xmath102 .",

    "we can count the number of committees in @xmath102 that contain a fixed list @xmath109 in the ring @xmath50 . a list @xmath110 that is contained in a committee @xmath111",
    "can be visualized as in figure @xmath112 , which is labeled with the sizes of the various subsets involved .",
    "to construct such a committee @xmath14 , we must choose @xmath113 elements from the @xmath45 elements in @xmath114 , and @xmath115 elements from the @xmath116 elements not in @xmath117 .",
    "thus there are @xmath118 such committees .",
    "then consider : @xmath119 note that @xmath11 appears multiple times in this sum , once for every instance where a committee @xmath14 in @xmath102 contains @xmath10 .",
    "the number of times that happens depends on what ring @xmath10 is in ; for @xmath10 in @xmath50 , the number of committees in @xmath102 that contain @xmath10 is @xmath118 as calculated above .",
    "so our sum @xmath120 now becomes : @xmath121 \\binom{r}{r - m } \\binom{n - j - r}{k+m - j - r}\\\\ & = & \\sum_{r = m}^{d } \\quad   w_r \\quad \\binom{r}{r - m } \\binom{n - j - r}{k+m - j - r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the weight of the ring @xmath50 .",
    "the sum index starts at @xmath122 because all subsets of @xmath102 by construction must differ from @xmath37 by at least @xmath43 elements , and the index ends at @xmath77 , the diameter of the graph .",
    "then at least one of the committees @xmath123 must have approval proportion equal to or better than average , or in other words , @xmath124    now , consider a similar analysis using concentrically distributed voter data @xmath95 centered at @xmath37 with the same ring weights @xmath125 as @xmath9 . specifically",
    ", we assume that each list in @xmath50 receives voting proportion @xmath126 then , we note that a committee @xmath97 in @xmath102 will contain @xmath127 of the lists in the ring @xmath50 . again referring to figure [ fig : vrdiagram ] ,",
    "we see that a list that is in @xmath50 must contain @xmath55 elements of @xmath37 chosen from the @xmath128 such elements in @xmath97 , and must contain @xmath45 candidates not in @xmath37 chosen from the @xmath129 such candidates in @xmath97 .",
    "thus , if @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 so every committee in @xmath102 has the same approval proportion under @xmath95 . comparing the final expressions in @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we see that both are equal to @xmath134 where @xmath135 thus @xmath136    that is , the approval proportion of a most popular committee in @xmath102 under @xmath9 will equal or exceed the approval proportion of any committee in @xmath102 under @xmath95 .",
    "then , taking the maximum over all @xmath43 , we obtain the desired result .",
    "the numbers @xmath137 are integral to comparing the number of lists contained in various committees . most important",
    "are their relative sizes for a fixed value of @xmath45 .",

    "[ lem : ineqlemma ]    as an example of this , if @xmath140 and @xmath2 is approximately half of @xmath0 , then we obtain the condition that @xmath45 is less than half of @xmath2 .",
    "we start with the inequality @xmath139 . after expanding the binomial coefficients and canceling common terms ,",
    "we see this is equivalent to @xmath141 which is equivalent to @xmath142 , as desired .",
    "we are now in a position to prove our main theorem .",
    "we now assume that the voter distribution @xmath9 is supported in some ball @xmath81 centered at a list @xmath37 , with @xmath143 so that @xmath81 is not the entire johnson graph .",
