    "the modification proposed in ref . is to assign boltzmann weights depending on the net field acting on the cluster to decide whether the cluster should be flipped .",
    "unfortunately , the modified sw algorithm is not efficient .",
    "the problem is that large clusters of spins usually have a large net field acting on them and are prevented from flipping by these fields .",
    "an algorithm for ising systems with fields that avoids this problem was introduced by redner , machta , and chayes@xcite . in this _ two - replica _ cluster algorithm large clusters are constructed from two replicas of the same system and have no net field acting on them so that they may be freely flipped .",

    "however , we also find that this small value of @xmath1 requires one of the optional components and that this component depends on a special symmetry of ising model in a staggered field .",

    ". this discrepancy may be due to the sliding cut - off @xmath78 used here instead of a fixed cut - off at 200 employed in ref .   .",
    "table  [ tab : odd&even ] gives the integrated autocorrelation times for magnetization using the with only even or only odd translations .",
    "the comparison of algorithm with only even translations and with only odd translations in tables  [ tab : odd&even ] shows that odd translations together with global flips of one replica relative to another are essential to achieve small and slowly growing autocorrelation times when the staggered field is present .",

    "the swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm has the smallest @xmath98 in the absence of fields .",
    "however , when fields are present and the sw algorithm is then modified according to the method of ref .",
    "the performance is worse even than that of the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the slow equilibration of the sw algorithm in the presence of the staggered field is due to small acceptance probabilities for flipping large clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of staggered fields does not significantly change the performance the two - replica algorithm so long as odd translations are present .",
    "inactive flips are helpful when there is no staggered field but when the staggered field is turned on , the autocorrelation time is not substantially improved by inactive flips .",
    "the explanation for the ineffectiveness of inactive flips when the staggered field is present is that the probability of accepting an inactive flip is small .",
    "for example , this probability is @xmath99 for @xmath97 and @xmath100 .",
    "the cpu time per spin on a pentium iii 450 mhz machine was also measured for the various algorithms and is listed in table  [ tab : compare ] for @xmath97 . by considering a range of system sizes we found that the cpu time for one mc sweep of the algorithm increases nearly linearly with the number of spins .",
    "the algorithm is a factor of 3 slower than the metropolis algorithm but this difference is more than compensated for by system size @xmath101 by the much faster equilibration of the algorithm . even without odd translations ,",
    "the algorithm outperforms metropolis for size 80 .",
    "the ratio of the integrated to exponential autocorrelation times was found to be nearly independent of system size over the range @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "we found that over this size range @xmath104 varied from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for @xmath96 ; from @xmath107 to @xmath108 for @xmath109 ; and from @xmath110 to @xmath111 for @xmath100 .",
    "the ratio @xmath112 is also nearly independent of @xmath9 and @xmath113 and is about 0.45 .",
    "the ratio @xmath114 is nearly independent of @xmath9 but decreases slowly with @xmath113 ranging from 0.29 to 0.25 as @xmath113 ranges from 0 to 4 .",
    "the almost constant @xmath115 for different sizes suggests that the integrated and exponential autocorrelation times are governed by the same dynamic critical exponent .      figures  [ fig : m - bilog ] and [ fig : m - log ] show the magnetization integrated autocorrelation time for the plotted on log - log and log - linear scales , respectively .",
    "figures  [ fig : e - bilog ] and [ fig : e - log ] show the energy integrated autocorrelation time for the plotted on log - log and log - linear scales , respectively .",
    "figures  [ fig : s - bilog ] and [ fig : s - log ] show the staggered magnetization integrated autocorrelation time for the plotted on log - log and log - linear scales , respectively .    for the whole range of @xmath9 , logarithmic growth appears to give a somewhat better fit than a simple power law , particularly for the magnetization .",
    "therefore , our results are consistent with @xmath116 for the algorithm . under the assumption that the dynamic exponent is not zero",
    ", we also carried out weighted least - squares fits to the form @xmath117 and varied @xmath118 , the minimum system size included in the fit .",
    "figures  [ fig : m - z ] , [ fig : e - z ] and [ fig : s - z ] show the dynamic exponent @xmath1 for the magnetization , energy and staggered magnetization , respectively , as a function of @xmath118 using the algorithm .",
    "figures [ fig : even - z ] and [ fig : odd - z ] , show the dynamic exponent as a function of @xmath118 for the magnetization for the with only even translations and only odd translations , respectively . in all cases except @xmath119 ,",
    "the dynamic exponent is a decreasing function of @xmath118 .",
    "for the magnetization , @xmath120 appears to extrapolate to a value between 0.1 and 0.2 as @xmath121 while for the energy and staggered magnetization , the dynamic exponent appears to extrapolate to a value between 0.3 and 0.4 .",
    "the small value of the dynamic exponent requires that odd translations and flips are included in the algorithm . from fig .",
    "[ fig : even - z ] it is clear that the dynamic exponent is near 2 for the algorithm with only even translations .    table [ tab : dyn - exp ] gives results of the weighted least squares fits for @xmath1 for the smallest values of @xmath118 for which there is a reasonable confidence level . since there is a general downward curvature in the log - log graphs , these numbers are likely to be overestimates of the asymptotic values .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the asymptotic dynamic exponent for the algorithm is likely to be less than @xmath122 and is perhaps exactly zero .",
    "the dynamic exponent is apparently independent of the strength of the staggered field . for the case of the sw algorithm",
    "applied to the two - dimensional ising with no staggered field the best estimate is @xmath123@xcite but the results are also consistent with logarithmic growth of relaxation times .",
    "the numbers for dynamic exponent for the sw appear to be smaller than for the algorithm but this difference may simply reflect larger corrections to scaling in the case of the .",
    "we studied the dynamics of the two - replica cluster algorithm applied to the two - dimensional ising model in a staggered field .",
    "we found that the dynamic exponent of the algorithm is either very small ( @xmath124 ) or zero ( @xmath125 ) and that the dynamic exponent does not depend on the strength of the staggered field .",
    "a precise value of @xmath1 could not be determined because of large corrections to scaling .",
    "we tested the importance of various optional components of the algorithm and found that an odd translation and global flip of one replica relative to another is essential for achieving rapid equilibration . without this component , @xmath1 is near 2 so there is no qualitative improvement over the metropolis algorithm . an odd translation and global flip of one replica relative to the other allows for a large change of the total magnetization of the system with an acceptance fraction of @xmath126 .",
    "large changes in the global magnetization may also occur in the swendsen - wang algorithm in a field or via inactive flips in the algorithm but these flips have a small acceptance fraction due to the staggered field .",
    "unfortunately , the odd translation and flip move is allowed because of a special symmetry of the ising model in a staggered field . for more general ising systems with translationally invariant fields , we expect performance similar to the with even translations only . in this case , the autocorrelation time is significantly less than for the metropolis algorithm but the dynamic exponent is about the same .",
    "while the two - replica approach is useful for these more general problems of ising systems with fields , it does not constitute a method that overcomes critical slowing down except when additional symmetries are present that allow one replica to be flipped relative to the other .",
