    "the energy loss of partons is predicted to be a sensitive probe of the qcd matter created in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions since its magnitude depends strongly on the color charge density of the matter traversed  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the understanding of the flavor dependent coupling of quarks and the modification of their fragmentation function give essential information on the properties of the hot qcd matter produced in such collisions  @xcite . due to their large mass ( @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 ) ,",
    "heavy quarks are believed to be produced predominantly in hard scattering processes in the early stage of the collision and , therefore , probe the complete space - time evolution of the expanding medium and their yields are sensitive to the initial gluon density  @xcite .",
    "heavy - quark production by initial state gluon fusion also dominates in heavy - ion collisions where many , in part overlapping nucleon - nucleon collisions occur .",
    "it has been shown that charm production in the qcd medium might be significant at lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "the penetrating power of heavy quarks is much higher than for light quarks , providing a sensitive probe of the matter .",
    "theoretical models based on perturbative qcd predict that the energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium is expected to be smaller compared to light - quarks and gluons due to the mass dependent suppression of the gluon radiation at small angles , the so - called dead - cone effect  @xcite .",
    "however , recent rhic results on single electron production in nucleus - nucleus collisions have shown that the yield at high transverse momentum is suppressed to the same level as observed for light - quark hadrons .",
    "azimuthal angular correlations of heavy - quark particles allow for the study of the fragmentation function of charm and bottom quarks separately , where high-@xmath0 decay electrons are associated with open charmed mesons .",
    "of single electrons in the 10% most central au+au collisions at @xmath4  = 200 gev measured by the phenix collaboration .",
    "the data are compared with a collisional dissociation model ( purple curve ) . ]    at rhic charm and bottom quarks are identified by assuming that isolated electrons in the event originate from semileptonic decays of heavy - quark mesons . at high transverse momentum , this mechanism of electron production is dominant enough to reliably subtract other sources of electrons such as @xmath5 conversions and @xmath6 dalitz decays .",
    "star  @xcite and phenix measurements  @xcite in central au+au collisions have shown that the high-@xmath0 yield of electrons from semileptonic charm and bottom decays is suppressed relative to properly scaled proton - proton collisions , quantified in the nuclear modification factor @xmath3  @xcite ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this factor exhibits an unexpectedly similar amount of suppression as observed for light - quark hadrons , suggesting substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the produced medium .",
    "this finding is not in line with expectations from the dead - cone effect .",
    "energy - loss models incorporating contributions from charm and bottom do not describe the observed suppression sufficiently well ( see discussions in  @xcite ) .",
    "although it has been realized that energy loss of heavy quarks by elastic parton scattering causing collisional energy loss is probably of comparable importance to energy loss by gluon radiation , yet the quantitative description of the suppression is still not satisfying .",
    "first attempts has been performed to distinguish between radiative and collisional energy loss  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the in - medium fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy mesons which are collisionally dissociated , a process that can happen multiple times in the medium , may be significant in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in addition , cold nuclear effects might explain part of the observed high-@xmath0 yield suppression  @xcite .",
    "collisions at @xmath7  = 200 gev obtained from electron  hadron and electron  d@xmath8 meson azimuthal correlations .",
    "error bars are statistical and brackets are systematic uncertainties .",
    "the solid curve illustrates the fonll calculation  @xcite with its theoretical uncertainties ( dashed curve ) . ]",
    "perturbative qcd calculations at fixed - order plus next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) level have shown that the bottom contribution to the heavy - quark decay electrons is significant at intermediate @xmath0 ( 4 - 5 gev / c ) although the uncertainties are relatively large  @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements of the relative charm and bottom contribution to the single electrons is essential .",
    "azimuthal angular correlations of single electrons and hadrons allow to exploit the different fragmentation of the associated jets  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks have , in general , a harder fragmentation function than gluons and light quarks , making the near - side correlation more sensitive to the decay kinematics . for the same electron transverse momentum the near - side electron ",
    "hadron angular correlation distribution from b decays is much broader than that from d decays .",
    "furthermore , azimuthal angular correlations of heavy - quark decay electrons and open charmed mesons yield important information about the charm and bottom contributions due to their different decay kinematics  @xcite .",
    "flavor conservation implies that heavy quarks are produced in quark anti - quark pairs .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the underlying production process can be obtained from events in which both heavy - quark particles are detected . due to momentum conservation",
    ", these heavy - quark pairs are correlated in relative azimuth ( @xmath9 ) in the plane perpendicular to the colliding beams , leading to the characteristic back - to - back orientated sprays of particles .",
    "this correlation survives the fragmentation process to a large extent in @xmath10 collisions .",
    "charm quarks predominantly ( @xmath1154% ) hadronize directly and bottom quarks via b decays into d@xmath8 mesons .",
    "the branching fraction for charm and bottom decays into electrons is @xmath1110%  @xcite .",
    "while triggering on the so - called leading electron ( trigger side ) , the balancing heavy quark , which is identified by the d@xmath8 meson , can be used to identify the underlying production mechanisms ( probe side ) . requiring like - sign electron ",
    "kaon pairs , where the kaons stem from the d@xmath8 decays , the near - side correlation peak can be attributed to b decays only whereas the contribution to the away - side peak can mostly be attributed to charmed meson decays .",
    "figure  [ fig:2a ] depicts the relative bottom contribution to the single electrons from @xmath10 collisions at @xmath7  = 200  gev measured by the star experiment  @xcite .",
    "the phenix collaboration obtained similar results  @xcite .",
    "the data provide convincing evidence that the bottom contribution to the single electron yields is of the same magnitude than that of charm at and above @xmath0 = 5 gev / c .",
    "the direct measurements of open charm and bottom mesons at rhic will be possible with the high precision @xmath12 vertex detectors in the star and phenix experiments .",

    "figure  [ fig:2b ] illustrates the charm and bottom contribution to the single electrons at 0.2 , 10 and 14 tev  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the crossing point , where bottom starts to dominate over charm seems to be at around the same @xmath0 for all three collision energies .",
    "a possible explanation is that at the lhc energies more bottom is produced at small @xmath0 with respect to charm than at rhic energies , which would bring the crossing point closer to zero . on the other hand",
    "the single spectra of bottom and charm are likely to be more similar at the lhc due to the fact that the quark mass is less relevant .",
    "this would push the crossing point away from zero .",
    "it seems that both mechanisms roughly compensate each other .",
    "alice , a large ion collider experiment , is the dedicated detector to study hot qcd matter in lead - lead collisions at the tev scale at the cern - lhc . the initial energy density in the collision zone is expected to be about one order of magnitude higher than at the rhic facility ( @xmath11100  gev/@xmath13 ) .",
    "the higher energy density allows thermal equilibrium to be reached more quickly and creates a relatively long - lived qgp phase .",
    "therefore , it is expected that most of the in - medium effects will be enhanced .",
