    "the deviation from a harmonic ladder of vibronic sates appears , but is insignificant for the model considered here , as the singly - excited state energy departure from the ideal harmonic progression is less than 5% and the chosen parameters ensure that we are away from the avoided - crossing regions ( see fig .",

    "similar parameters have already been used by investigating the vibronic transition dipole moment borrowing and coherence enhancement effects in molecular dimer systems @xcite .",
    "the introduced model captures both limiting cases of purely vibrational and purely electronic model systems that are usually considered separately . indeed , by assuming either the huang - rhys factors or the resonance interaction to be zero both limiting cases can be obtained .",
    "two prominent frequencies are present in the simulated oscillatory dynamics of the 2d spectrum of the vibronic molecular system .",
    "evidently , one frequency corresponds to the electronic energy gap @xmath59 , while the other is equal to the vibrational frequency @xmath0 .",
    "these coherences are between the states of mixed electronic - only and electronic - vibronic character , respectively ( table  [ tab : dipoles ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention , that a very similar amount of mixing is obtained using even simpler description with only one - particle vibronic states and @xmath93 included @xcite .",
    "the mixed character might indirectly appear more signifficant if the diagonal disorder is comparable to the gap between states of different character .",
    "then , the states of different character become overlapping leading to more mixing @xcite .",
    "however , the distribution of the transition frequencies not the amount of mixing of particular state defines the oscillations .",
    "thus , beatings with rather electronic and rather vibrational character still result in distinct oscillation maps and therefore the origin of the oscillation can be identified .",
    "strength of oscillations strongly depends on system inhomogeneity . from simulations ,",
    "this can clearly be seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : time - dependence - of ] , where time dependences of the peak value for different values of the gaussian disorder ( @xmath86 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) are presented . the initial intensive oscillations with the @xmath59 frequency decay",
    "rapidly when the disorder is increased and the only dynamics observed at longer delay times correspond to the @xmath0 beats .",
    "strengths of the oscillations at different frequencies are represented by the corresponding values of the amplitude in the oscillation maps .",
    "therefore , the value of the amplitude maximum of the oscillation map is used to evaluate the strength of the corresponding oscillation .",
    "the amplitude of electronic oscillations decays sharply with the disorder , while dependence of the amplitude of vibronic / vibrational coherences is much more flat ( the amplitudes for the stimulated emission ( se ) , excited state absorption ( esa ) and ground state bleaching ( gsb ) contributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes_diagrams ] ) .",
    "when disorder is absent , signatures of electronic coherences mostly coming from the se contribution are at least 5 times larger than those of vibrational character , while for @xmath96 the amplitude of electronic coherences is negligible ( the corresponding oscillation map for @xmath97 can not be resolved ) .",
    "separation of coherences of electronic and vibrational character is very significant as our results demonstrate that besides vibrational beats the electronic beats could be in principle observed and distinguished for the weakly disordered systems .",
    "however , the electronic beats rapidly decay in time in a gaussian fashion ( for the gaussian disorder ) as @xmath98 . whereas vibrational beats will prevail for longer times",
    ".    maximal amplitude of the oscillation , taken from the oscillation maps as a function of disorder for gsb ( diamonds ) , se ( squares ) and esa ( circles ) contributions at different beating frequencies ( @xmath0 and @xmath59 ) . ]    note that in the hamiltonian used ( eq .",
    "[ eq : hcoord ] ) no transformation of canonical variables into symmetric and antisymmetric components is performed that would allow us to decouple the schrdinger equations of the excited and ground states .",
    "therefore , presented model contains states which are not separated to diabatic or adiabatic ones as has been done in the theoretical work of jonas and coworkers addressing coherences in fmo @xcite .",
    "also , since we show the separation of beats of electronic and vibrational character for arbitrary system parameters , the resonant condition of the mixed character coherences ( for example , when electronic energy gap or the chromophore energy difference is equal to the vibrational frequency ) is just a special case of our model .",
    "it supports the assumptions about coherences in fmo where such resonant conditions are met  electronic coherences at initial times could be of the same order as those of the vibronic origin due to disorder of approximately @xmath99  @xmath100 ; electronic beats will decay in a short time ( ~200 fs ) while vibrational beats would persist over the long time . for higly disordered and uncorrelated systems electronic coherences are not likely to be significant at all and the observed coherent dynamics are due to the ground - state vibrations .",
    "it is also important to consider transition dipole moment orientations @xmath101 listed in table  [ tab : dipoles ] .",
    "the orientations of the transitions to the `` mixed '' states are different for each state and are also different from the transition dipole moments of monomer transitions .",
    "this implies that coherences involving arbitrary states ( of electronic or vibrational character ) might survive the measurements with polarization schemes , devised to suppress all but electronic coherence signals @xcite . on the other hand , these polarization schemes",
    "can then be used to distinguish between purely vibrational ( localized on one molecule ) and mixed origin coherences .",
    "results presented here are related to the assumption that the vibrational frequencies are not affected by inhomogeneities , which induce the disorder of electronic transition energy .",
    "this is often the case as vibrational resonances are less sensitive to the electrostatic configuration of the environment than the delocalized electronic wavefunctions .",
    "vibrational coherences , hence , decay on a timescale of vibrational dephasing , which usually is in the order of a picosecond .",
    "it should be also noted that when vibrational frequency @xmath0 matches the electronic energy gap @xmath59 , the quantum mechanical mixing complicates the whole picture .",
    "then damping of the resulting electronic - vibrational coherence will define the decay timescale of the oscillations in the spectra .",
    "coherent dynamics of coupled molecules can be effectively sorted out by the modeling of 2d spectra .",
    "coupling between the multitude of vibrational states on different molecules results in a manifold of mixed states .",
    "when vibrational frequency and the electronic energy gap are off resonance this manifold constitutes two ladders of equally - spaced and well - resolved states .",
    "two types of beats having either electronic or vibrational character can then be distinguished by the use of oscillation maps , constructed from the sequences of time - resolved 2d spectra .",
    "inhomogeneous disorder effects the coherences of different state character differently .",
    "the amplitude of the electronic character beatings , caused by the coherences in excited states , is dramatically reduced by the disorder and consequently electronic coherences are quickly dephased .",
    "vibrational character beatings stem from the ground and excited state contributions and depend weakly on the disorder , assuring their long - time survival .",
