    "the possible interactions between fundamental particles are best described by standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . despite its enormous successes ,",
    "the model suffers with a divergence due to the radiative correction of higgs mass which may run up to planck scale .",
    "an unnatural fine tuning is needed to confine the higgs mass within tev scale .",
    "many attempts have been made to solve this problem and the theory of extra dimensional models @xcite are one of them .",
    "extra dimensional models also have a natural outcome from string theory .",
    "depending on their geometry , these models are compactified under various compactification schemes .",
    "our usual four dimensional universe which is considered to be a 3-brane embedded within higher dimensional spacetime , emerges as a low energy effective theory @xcite and contains signatures of compactified extra dimension .    among all the extra dimensional models proposed so far , randall - sundrum ( rs ) warped model",
    "@xcite earned a special attention since it resolves the gauge hierarchy problem without introducing any intermediate scale ( between tev and planck scale ) in the theory . in rs model ,",
    "the full spaetime is of five dimensional ads nature where the extra dimension is spacelike and @xmath0 orbilfolded .",
    "the orbifolded fixed points are identified with two 3-branes embedded in the five dimensional spacetime .",
    "the separation between the branes is assumed to be @xmath1 planck length so that the hierarchy problem can be solved .",
    "however , without any stabilization mechanism , two brane system can collapse due to the intervening gravity .",
    "so , like other higher dimensional braneworld scenario , one of the crucial aspects of rs model is to stabilize the inter - brane separation ( known as modulus or radion ) . for this purpose",
    ", one needs to generate a radion potential with a stable minimum .",
    "goldberger and wise ( gw ) proposed a useful mechanism @xcite to construct such a radion potential by imposing a massive scalar field in the bulk where the scalar field has appropriate values on the branes . in gw mechanism , it is not required to introduce any hierarchy between the boundary values of the scalar field for stabilizing the modulus at a value consistent with that proposed in rs model in order to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "subsequently the phenomenology of radion field has also been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "this radion phenomenology along with rs graviton modes @xcite and rs black holes @xcite are considered as key signatures to search for warped extra dimension in collider experiments in lhc @xcite .",
    "some variants of rs model and its modulus stabilization have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the important questions that remain are :    * can the modulus of rs like warped spacetime be stabilized by some other agent than that of a massive bulk scalar field ?",
    "* if such a stabilization mechanism is found , then what is the resulting stabilization condition ?",
    "moreover , what are the mass and the coupling ( with sm fields ) of radion field ?",
    "we aim to address these questions in this paper and for this purpose , the effective on - brane theory we used , is formulated by kanno - soda in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : following two sections are devoted to brief reviews of rs scenario and the description of effective on - brane theory for rs like spacetime .",
    "the possibility of modulus stabilization for the said geometric model is explored in section iv . in section",
    "v , we find the necessary constraints on parametric space in order to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "section vi is reserved for the coupling between radion and sm fields .",
    "we end the paper with some conclusive remarks .",
    "rs scenario is defined on a five dimensional ads spacetime involving one warped and compact extra spacelike dimension .",
    "two 3-branes known as visible / tev and hidden / planck brane are embedded in this five dimensional spacetime where the intermediate region between the branes is termed as bulk. if @xmath2 is the extra dimensional linear coordinate , then the branes are located at two fixed points @xmath3 while the latter one is identified with our usual four dimensional universe . here , @xmath4 is the compactification radius of the extra dimension .",
    "the opposite brane tensions along with the finely tuned five dimensional cosmological constant serve as energy - momentum tensor of rs scenario .",
    "the resulting spacetime metric @xcite is non - factorizable and expressed as , @xmath5 due to @xmath0 compactification along the extra dimension , @xmath2 ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 , is of the order of 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath10 relates the 5d planck scale @xmath9 to the 5d cosmological constant @xmath11 . +",
    "all the dimensionful parameters described above are related to the reduced 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath12 as , @xmath13    in order to solve the hierarchy problem , it is assumed in rs scenario that the branes are separated by such a distance that @xmath14 . then the exponential factor present in the metric , which is often called warp factor , produces a large suppression so that a mass scale of the order of planck scale is reduced to tev scale on the visible brane .",
    "a scalar mass say mass of higgs is given as , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are physical and bare higgs mass respectively . in rs model",
    ", it is assumed that the inter - brane separation is of the order of planck length so that the required hierarchy between the branes is generated .",
    "one of the crucial aspects of this braneworld scenario is to stabilize the distance between the branes . for this purpose",
    ", goldberger and wise demonstrated that the modulus corresponding to the radius of the extra dimension in rs warped geometry model can be stabilized @xcite by invoking a massive scalar field in the bulk with appropriate vacuum expectation values ( vev ) at the two 3-branes that reside at the orbifold fixed points .",
    "consequently the phenomenology of the radion field originating from 5d gravitational degrees of freedom has also been explored @xcite .",
    "in rs model , the einstein equations are derived for a fixed inter - brane separation as well as for flat 3-branes . however , the scenario changes if the distance between the branes becomes a function of spacetime coordinates and the brane geometry is curved .",
    "these generalizations are incorporated while deriving the effective on - brane action via `` low energy expansion scheme '' in @xcite .",
    "the model we considered in the present paper is described by a five dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime with two 3-branes embedded within the spacetime .",
    "the spacetime geometry is @xmath0 orbifolded along the extra dimension .",
    "taking @xmath2 as the extra dimensional linear coordinate , the branes are situated at orbifolded fixed points i.e. at @xmath18 ( planck brane ) and @xmath19 ( tev brane ) respectively . an additional constant energy density ( over and above the brane tension ) is localized on planck brane .",
    "moreover , the proper distance between the branes is considered as a function of spacetime coordinates .",
    "the action of this model @xcite is following : @xmath20\\nonumber\\\\    & -&\\int d^4x [ \\sqrt{-g_{hid } } v_{hid } + \\sqrt{-g_{vis } } v_{vis}]\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g_{hid } } \\lambda_{hid }   \\label{five dim action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 are the brane coordinates .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath9 is the five dimensional planck mass . @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath1 planck length ) are the ricci scalar and curvature radius of the five dimensional spacetime . hidden and visible brane tensions are respectively , given by , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the additional energy density , localized on the hidden brane .",
    "we use the following metric ansatz @xcite with a warping nature along the extra dimension i.e. @xmath28 @xmath29 is commonly known as warp factor which has a dependence on all the spacetime coordinates while the component @xmath30 is taken as the function of brane coordinates only @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 is assumed to be less than the brane tensions . as a consequence of this assumption ,",
    "brane curvature radius @xmath31 is much larger than the bulk curvature @xmath24 i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "then the bulk einstein equations can be solved perturbatively where @xmath33 is taken as the perturbation parameter .",
    "this method is known as `` low energy expansion scheme '' @xcite in which the metric is expanded with increasing power of @xmath33 .",
    "the zeroth order perturbation solution replicates the rs solution where the inter - brane separation is constant .",
    "the effective on - brane action obtained up to first order of perturbation , incorporates the fluctuation of modulus as well as non - zero value of brane matter . using the low energy expansion scheme , the warp factor and the effective four dimensional action are as follows :    @xmath34    and @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-h } \\lambda_{hid }   \\label{effective action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 is the ricci scalar formed by @xmath38 .",
    "this above form of @xmath39 matches with that obtained in @xcite .    it may be noticed from eqn.([effective action ] ) that upon projecting the bulk gravity on the brane , the extra degrees of freedom of @xmath23 ( with respect to @xmath37 ) appears as scalar field @xmath40 which directly couples with the four dimensional ricci scalar . hence the effective on - brane action is a brans - dicke like theory where the self coupling of the scalar field is not a constant .",
    "eqn.([five dim metric ] ) leads to the separation between hidden and visible brane along the path of constant @xmath41 as follows : @xmath42 above expression ( eqn.([brane separation ] ) ) clearly indicates that the proper distance between the branes depends on the brane coordinates and that s why @xmath43 can be treated as field . from the perspective of four dimensional effective theory , this field",
    "is termed as radion field ( or modulus field ) which is symbolized by @xmath40 in eqn.([effective action ] ) . designating the modulus field ,",
    "now we move to the issue for stabilizing that modulus which is described in the next section .",
    "like other higher dimensional braneworld scenario , one of the important aspects of the model we considered , is to stabilize the modulus . for this purpose",
    ", one needs to generate a suitable radion potential which has a stable minimum .",
    "goldberger and wise proposed a mechanism @xcite to create such a radion potential by invoking a massive bulk scalar field with appropriate boundary values .    in this paper",
    ", we show that without the presence of a massive scalar field in the bulk @xcite , a non - zero constant energy density localized on hidden brane ( @xmath27 ) is sufficient to generate a stable radion potential . in the next subsection",
    ", we explicitly describe the mechanism for generating the modulus potential from `` hidden brane energy density '' ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the form of effective action obtained in eqn.([effective action ] ) clearly reveals that the kinetic term of the gravitational field ( @xmath44 ) as well as of the radion field ( @xmath40 ) are not canonical .",
    "thus to make the kinetic terms canonically normalized , lets transform the gravitational field as , @xmath45 the above transformation is commonly known as conformal transformation where @xmath46 is the conformal factor . due to this conformal transformation , the ricci scalar tranforms as follows ,    @xmath47   \\nonumber\\\\\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the ricci scalar formed by @xmath38 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the dalembertian operator is defined as @xmath51 . using the above relaton between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the action ( in eqn.([efective action ] ) ) can be written as ,    @xmath54   - \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-\\tilde{h } } e^{2\\sigma}\\lambda_{hid }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to make the redefined gravitational field ( @xmath50 ) canonical , take the conformal factor as @xmath55 . with this choice of conformal factor , the above action turns out to be ,    @xmath56\\nonumber\\\\   & -&\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-\\tilde{h } } \\frac{1}{\\psi^2}\\lambda_{hid }   \\label{efective action1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we drop the surface term constructed by the dalembertian operator .",
    "so , we manage to make the gravitational field canonical which is evident from the action presented in eqn.([efective action1 ] ) .    comparing eqn.([effective action ] ) and eqn.([efective action1 ] )",
    ", it may be observed that the self coupling of the scalar field changes on performing the conformal transformation .",
    "it is expected because the conformal factor itself depends on the scalar field @xmath40 .",
    "to get canonically normalized radion field lets transform @xmath57 in such a way that the following relation @xmath58 ^ 2 = ( 3l/2\\kappa^2 ) \\frac{1}{\\psi^2(1-\\psi ) }   \\label{diff equation}\\ ] ] holds .",
    "thus in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the four dimensional effective action takes the following form ,    @xmath61   \\label{efective action2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where all the kinetic terms become normalized .",
    "the term @xmath62 in eqn.([efective action2 ] ) acts as a potential for the canonical radion field @xmath60 .",
    "afterwards , we denote this potential term by @xmath63 . in order to extract the explicit dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath64",
    ", one needs the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath64 i.e. @xmath66 .",

    "this is expected because the radion potential is created due to the non - zero value of @xmath27 .",
    "using the form of warp factor ( in eqn.([warp factor ] ) ) , the physical higgs mass is obtained as , @xmath80 where @xmath17 is the natural cut - off scale ( @xmath81 gev ) of the theory and to derive the above relation between @xmath82 and @xmath17 , it is assumed that higgs field is confined to visible brane only @xcite . using eqn.([stabilized modulus ] ) , @xmath82 can be expressed as , @xmath83 thus in order to confine the higgs mass ( @xmath82 ) within tev scale , the value of the parameter @xmath68 is taken as @xmath84 .",
