    "in order to perform precise measurements of properties of top quarks at the lhc , the use of reliable tools will be essential .",
    "extensive work has been carried out to improve parton - shower and matrix - element monte carlo ( mc ) codes for @xmath0 and single - top signals and backgrounds .",
    "parton shower generators , such as herwig @xcite or pythia @xcite , simulate top production and decay using leading - order ( lo ) matrix elements and describe multiple radiation in the soft or collinear approximation .",
    "herwig showers satisfy angular ordering , valid in the soft approximation after azimuthal averaging , while pythia orders its cascades according to transverse momentum or virtuality , with an option to veto non - angular - ordered emissions . to simulate hard and large - angle radiation , both pythia and herwig",
    "have been provided with matrix - element corrections .",
    "herwig splits the physical phase space into a soft / collinear region , where one trusts parton showers , and a region , corresponding to hard and large - angle radiation , where the exact amplitude is used .",
    "moreover , herwig corrects the ` hardest - so - far ' emission in the shower .",
    "the pythia implementation is somewhat different : the parton shower approximation is used throughout the entire physical phase space and the first emission is generated exactly .",
    "herwig @xcite and pythia @xcite include matrix - element corrections to top - quark decay , but not to top production .",
    "such corrections are also applied to @xmath1-boson production , which is matched to the @xmath2 jet process @xcite , one of the backgrounds for top production . at the end of the parton cascade , herwig and pythia",
    "simulate the hadronization transition according to the cluster @xcite and string @xcite models , respectively . as for the underlying event ,",
    "both programs deal with it by allowing multiple interactions @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "herwig is interfaced with the jimmy code .",
    "@xcite and pythia 8 @xcite are the new object - oriented versions of the two codes , written in c++ .",
    "pythia 8 implements only transverse - momentum evolution , with initial / final - state radiation and multiple interactions interweaved in a common ordering .",
    "herwig++ includes a mass - dependent term in the splitting functions , leading to a better treatment of the radiation off heavy quarks and heavy - hadron fragmentation .    besides herwig and pythia , other parton showers generators are available .",
    "the ariadne @xcite code uses pythia hard scattering and hadronization , but its showers are dipole cascades , i.e. @xmath3 branchings in the soft limit .",
    "the evolution variable of ariadne is transverse momentum : in fact , implementing dipole emissions , there is no need for azimuthal averaging and angular ordering .",
    "the sherpa @xcite generator implements showers which , like in pythia , are ordered in virtuality , with an option to reject non - angular - ordered emissions .",
    "hadronization occurs following the string model .",
    "a feature of ariadne and sherpa is that matrix - element matching is implemented according to the ckkw ",
    "l @xcite method .",
    "jets are clustered according to the @xmath4-algorithm @xcite , with a threshold @xmath5 on the @xmath4-clustering variable @xmath6 .",
    "exact matrix elements , weighted by the sudakov form factors , and parton - shower approximations are then used above and below @xmath5 .",
    "the programs mentioned so far , even after matrix - element matching , still yield lo rates .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross sections and observables are instead given by the codes mc@nlo @xcite and powheg @xcite , both available for top production .",
    "mc@nlo implements the hard scattering at nlo and employs herwig for showers and hadronization : its drawbacks are its shower - model ( herwig ) dependence and its simulation of events with negative weights .",
    "such problems have been overcome by powheg , which can be interfaced to any shower model and does not have any negatively - weighted event .",
    "the first powheg emission is the hardest in transverse momentum @xmath7 and is generated exactly at nlo ; the subsequent cascade is ordered in @xmath8 . to include angular ordering",
    ", one would need truncated showers , whose implementation is in progress .",
    "finally , in order to simulate multi - jet final states in top - quark events and backgrounds , such as @xmath9 jets , the best available tools are the so - called ` matrix - element generators ' , such as alpgen @xcite , madgraph / madevent @xcite , comphep @xcite , helac @xcite , gr@ppa @xcite and whizard @xcite , which include lo multi - parton amplitudes .",
    "such programs can be interfaced to herwig or pythia for showering and hadronization , according to the les houches accord .",
    "the alpgen code , for example , includes the following processes ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) : @xmath12  jets , @xmath13  jets , @xmath14  jets , @xmath15  jets .",
    "it uses the so - called mlm prescription to match its partons with the subsequent showers . roughly speaking ,",
    "one starts , e.g. , with @xmath16 partons and defines a cone jet algorithm . after showering ,",
    "a @xmath17-jet event is accepted only if @xmath18 and each of the @xmath19 original partons is clustered into a different jet .",
    "we would like to present some results for top - quark signals and backgrounds at the lhc , using the programs described above . following @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ hwmc ] we present the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 pair at the lhc according to herwig , mc@nlo and the parton - level nlo calculation , with all distributions normalized to the same area . at small @xmath20 , where one is mostly sensitive to soft / collinear parton radiation ,",
    "mc@nlo and herwig agree , while the pure nlo calculation is far above the two codes . at large @xmath20",
    ", it is instead the nlo computation which is reliable : mc@nlo and the nlo prediction agree , while herwig underestimates the large-@xmath20 rate . in fig .",
    "[ hwmc ] we also compare mc@nlo and powheg for stable top - quark production : up to a small discrepancy at very low @xmath20 , the agreement between the two codes is remarkable @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ y1 ] we present the rapidity of the hardest jet @xmath21 , yielded by mc@nlo and alpgen : we have clear disagreement around @xmath22 , with alpgen giving more events than mc@nlo .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this is due to the fact that mc@nlo does not generate enough hard scatterings with @xmath23 in the final state .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that powheg , whose first emission is always generated at nlo , yields a @xmath21-spectrum similar to alpgen ( see fig .",
    "[ y1 ] ) .    for single - top production ,",
    "a comparison among some of the available codes was performed in @xcite .",
    "[ singlet ] shows the total transverse momentum of all partons in the hardest jet , relative to the jet axis , using herwig , mc@nlo and the nlo calculation .",
    "the agreement between herwig and mc@nlo is acceptable over the full range : in fact , @xmath24 is a sufficiently inclusive observable , so that nlo effects mainly result in an overall @xmath25-factor .",
    "the nlo result is sharply peaked at @xmath26 , since at nlo a jet often coincides with a single parton . at large @xmath27 ,",
    "the nlo result overestimates the prediction of the two mc codes , where a large-@xmath27 hadron likely belongs to another jet . among the backgrounds to single - top production ,",
    "@xmath28 jets , at least one with a @xmath29 quark , were studied in @xcite , making use of mcfm @xcite , a nlo parton - level code .",
    "[ singlet ] shows the @xmath8 distribution of the lepton from @xmath1 decay , for the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 processes . at the lhc ,",
    "@xmath31 is dominant , while the other two backgrounds are roughly comparable .        we wish to present a few studies on the theoretical uncertainty on the top mass measurement .",
    "@xcite discusses the error in the lepton+jets channel , due to different parametrizations of the underlying event in pythia , with the possible inclusion of jet - energy - scale corrections . as showed in fig .",
    "[ und ] , several tunings and models are investigated and the overall uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath37  gev . scale and parton - density uncertainties are instead studied in @xcite .",
    "[ und ] also presents the nlo cross section @xmath38 , as a function of @xmath39 , for various values of renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "the relation @xmath40 emphasizes that the relative error on @xmath39 can not be below @xmath41 , if @xmath39 is determined from a measurement of the cross section .",
    "another source of uncertainty on @xmath39 is @xmath29-quark fragmentation in top decay , which relies on the hadronization models implemented in mc generators , fitted to @xmath42 data . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the default parametrizations of cluster and string models are uncapable of fitting @xmath43-hadron data from lep and sld .",
    "after fitting few parameters , pythia gives a good description of the data , whereas herwig is only marginally consistent .",
    "therefore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bfr ] , herwig and pythia predictions for the @xmath43-spectrum in top decay look quite different : such a result will have an impact on the mc uncertainty on @xmath39 .",
    "the analysis @xcite investigates instead the systematic error due to initial- ( isr ) , final - state radiation ( fsr ) , underlying event ( ue ) and hadronization on the reconstruction of @xmath39 as the invariant mass of the @xmath44-jet combination , in the lepton+jets channel .",
    "the @xmath29-jet is clustered according to the @xmath4 ( ktjet ) and cone ( pxcone ) algorithms .",
    "@xcite found that , relying on the @xmath4 algorithm , the reconstructed @xmath39 shows visible dependence on fsr , isr and ue , whereas hadronization effects are very little . when using the cone one , fsr and hadronization have a large impact , while isr and ue effects are negligible .",
    "given the different features of the two algorithms , using both of them is therefore advisable .    as for matrix - element generators , table  [ tabjet ]",
    "@xcite quotes the results of a few codes on @xmath45 jets , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , one of the backgrounds for top production .",
    "it is remarkable that , as long as a process is implemented , the considered codes agree .",
    "more exclusive studies on @xmath48 jets were carried out in @xcite , but even there the used programs were found to agree .",
    "[ bfr ] shows the transverse energy distribution of the first four hardest jets yielded by alpgen , ariadne , helac , madevent and sherpa .    in summary",
    ", we reviewed some of the existing event generators for top signals and background and presented a few results for the lhc . given the large numbers of available tools , it is always advisable using at least two codes for comparison .",
