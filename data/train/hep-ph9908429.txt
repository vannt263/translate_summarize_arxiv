    "we analyze the effect of the majorana phase for the stability against quantum corrections of the maximal mixing between the second and the third generations , which is suggested by the atmospheric neutrino experiments@xcite .",

    "the maximal mixing is not spoiled by quantum corrections when majorana phase is equal to @xmath0 because the neutrino mass matrix has the pseudo - dirac texture@xcite .",
    "the continuous change of the majorana phase from @xmath0 to @xmath2 makes the maximal mixing be spoiled by quantum corrections when neutrino masses are of @xmath1(ev ) .    when there is the large mass hierarchy between neutrinos , the lepton flavor mixing is stable against quantum corrections independently of the majorana phase .",

    "since the atmospheric neutrino experiments suggest@xcite @xmath14 we analyze the stability of the mixing angle @xmath12 against quantum corrections around @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", eq.([d - kappa ] ) shows @xmath16 quantum corrections change the form of @xmath17@xcite as @xmath18 the unitary matrix @xmath19 which diagonalizes @xmath20 shows us whether the maximal mixing between the second and the third generations is spoiled by quantum corrections or not .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath21 which diagonalizes @xmath20 in eq.([k ] ) is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 which is determined by the atmospheric neutrino experiments@xcite . equation ( [ mixing ] ) shows that the mixing angle @xmath24 is stable ( unstable ) against quantum corrections when the value of @xmath25 is larger ( smaller ) than that of @xmath26 .",
    "when two mass eigenvalues are degenerate as @xmath27 , we can easily see the following facts at @xmath28 , and @xmath0 :    1 .",
    "when @xmath28 , eq.([mixing ] ) derives @xmath29 this means that the mixing angle @xmath24 is stable ( unstable ) when the value of @xmath30 is larger ( smaller ) than that of @xmath26 . when @xmath31 ev , the value of @xmath32 is small enough for the maximal mixing to be spoiled by quantum corrections@xcite .",
    "when @xmath33 , eq.([mixing ] ) derives @xmath34 this means that the maximal mixing is not spoiled by quantum corrections .",
    "it is because the absolute values of off - diagonal elements in @xmath20 are much larger than those of diagonal elements , which is so - called the pseudo - dirac texture . equation ( [ 11 ] ) is induced just from the initial value of @xmath35 . for the general values of @xmath12 , it is satisfied that @xmath36@xcite .",

    "figure 1 also shows that the maximal mixing is stable against quantum corrections around @xmath49 independently of the value of @xmath13 .",
    "it is because eq.([mixing ] ) derives @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "the physical majorana phase can be rotated out by the field redefinition in this case .",
