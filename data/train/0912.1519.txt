    "in recent years , our knowledge of the hard x - ray sky ( @xmath010 kev ) has improved significantly thanks to the results obtained by ibis ( ubertini et al .",
    "2003 ) on board _ integral _ ( winkler et al . 2003 ) and bat ( barthelmy et al . 2005 ) on board _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) .",
    "both telescopes operate in similar wave bands ( around 20200 kev ) with a limiting sensitivity of about a mcrab and a point source location accuracy of the order of a few arcminutes .",
    "these instruments continue to perform a survey of the high energy sky , thus providing the best yet sample of objects selected in the soft gamma - ray band .",
    "a significant number of the sources detected by these two satellites are still unidentified / unclassified and/or have no information in the 210 kev energy range .",
    "recently , the fourth _ integral_/ibis survey ( bird et al .",
    "2009 ) containing 723 hard x - ray ( 17100 kev ) emitters has been compiled . for many sources in this new ibis catalogue a refined localisation , which is possible by exploiting the capability of current focusing x - ray telescopes ,",
    "is necessary in order to pinpoint and classify their optical counterpart .",
    "furthermore , information in the x - ray band are often lacking so that it is not always possible to characterise these sources in terms of spectral shape , flux , absorption properties and variability . to this aim ,",
    "we have cross - correlated the list of ibis sources included in the fourth ibis catalogue with the archive of all _ swift_/xrt pointings , finding a sample of 20 objects for which low energy data can help in identifying the x - ray and hence the optical counterpart and/or in providing x - ray spectral and variability information .",
    "we emphasise that most of the associations and hence types listed in the fourth ibis survey , for these 20 sources , stem from this work .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we briefly present the method adopted for the xrt data reduction and the criteria assumed for the spectral analysis .",
    "3 is devoted to the discussion of the results for each individual sources .",
    "conclusion are drawn in sect .",
    "for all sources in the sample , we use x - ray data acquired with the x - ray telescope ( xrt , 0.310 kev , burrows et al . 2005 ) on board the _ swift _ satellite .",
    "the xrt data reduction was performed using the xrtdas standard data pipeline package ( xrtpipeline v. 0.12.2 ) , in order to produce screened event files .",
    "all data were extracted only in the photon counting ( pc ) mode ( hill et al .",
    "2004 ) , adopting the standard grade filtering ( 012 for pc ) according to the xrt nomenclature .",
    "the log of all xrt observations presented in this paper is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "for each measurement , we report the observation code ( i d ) , the observation date and the exposure time .    for each observation we analysed , with ximage v. 4.4.1 , the 0.310 kev image to search for sources detected ( at a confidence level @xmath0 3@xmath1 ) both within the 90% and 99% ibis error circles .",
    "then , we estimated the x - ray positions using the task xrtcentroid v.0.2.9 by taking into account the longest pointing for those sources with more than one observation .",
    "xrt images are shown in figure 1 to 20 with overlapping ibis error circles and , when available , also bat positional uncertainties .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] lists all 20 ibis sources analysed here together with their position and relative uncertainty as listed in bird et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as well as their location with respect to the galactic plane . for each of these gamma - ray emitters",
    ", we then report the position and relative uncertainties ( at 90% confidence level ) of all sources detected by xrt within the 90% and 99% ibis error circles as well as the count rate in the 0.310 kev energy band and the likely counterpart found searching in various on - line archives such as ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) , heasarc ( high energy astrophysics science archive research center ) and simbad ( set of identifications , measurements , and bibliography for astronomical data ) . following harrison et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we estimated the probability of detecting a 210 kev extragalactic source with flux greater @xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 by chance within a typical error circle of 35 arcmin radius to be negligible , i.e. close to zero over the entire sample .",
    "next , we analysed the spectra of the most likely x - ray counterparts , which have xrt data with a signal to noise ratio above 5@xmath1 , in order to perform a reliable spectral analysis ; for other objects only flux information are provided .",
    "events for spectral analysis were extracted within a circular region of radius 20@xmath5 , centered on the source position ; this region encloses about 90% of the psf at 1.5 kev ( see moretti et al .",
    "the background was taken from source - free regions close to the x - ray source of interest , using circular regions with different radii in order to ensure an evenly sampled background .",
    "the source spectrum was then extracted from the corresponding event file using the xselect v.2.4 software and binned using grppha in an appropriate way , so that the @xmath6 statistic could be applied .",
    "we used version v.011 of the response matrices and created the relative ancillary response file _ arf _ using the task xrtmkarf v. 0.5.6 .",
    "the energy band used for the spectral analysis , performed with xspec v. 11.3.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) , depends on the statistical quality of the data and typically ranges from 0.3 to @xmath78 kev .    for objects with more than one pointing",
    ", we summed together all the available observations and performed the spectral analysis of the average spectrum , unless flux variability was evident in the data ; in the first istance , we adopted , as our basic model , a simple power law passing through galactic absorption ( kalberla et al .",
    "if this baseline model was not sufficient to fit the data , we then introduced extra spectral components as required .",
    "the results of this analysis are reported in table  [ tab3 ] , where we list the galactic absorption , the column density in excess to this galactic value , the power law photon index , the reduced @xmath6 of the best - fit model and the 210 kev flux .",
    "all quoted errors correspond to 90@xmath8 confidence level for a single parameter of interest ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the x - ray spectral analysis results is given in a dedicated section for each source .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the use of the xrt data archive has allowed us to find the optical counterpart and/or provide x - ray information for 20 _ integral _ sources in the fourth ibis catalogue .",
    "the result of our work is summarised in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "interestingly , the majority of the sources discussed in this paper appear to be agn even if their location is sometime close to the galactic plane .",
    "four objects ( igr j004654005 , leda 96373 , igr j1248.25828 and igr j131075626 ) are confirmed or likely absorbed active galaxies , while two ( igr j140803023 and 1rxs j213944.3 + 595016 ) are unabsorbed agn .",
    "three objects are more peculiar extragalactic objects , ngc 4728 being a narrow line seyfert galaxy , mcg+0426006 a type 2 liner and pks 1143693 probably a qso ; finally , two objects ( igr j08262 + 4051 , and igr j222344116 ) are candidate agn , which require further optical spectroscopic follow - up observations to be classified . only in the case of 1rxs j080114.6462324",
    "we are confident that the source is a galactic object . in three cases ( igr j104476027 ,",
    "igr j121235802 and igr j20569 + 4940 ) one x - ray counterpart was pinpointed , although its nature could not be assessed despite spectral and sometimes variability information have been obtained .",
    "clearly , these objects need to be optically observed and classified before their nature is firmly assessed .",
    "finally , in five cases no obvious x - ray counterpart ( igr j075061547 and igr j170086425 ) or even no detection ( igr j173312406 , igr j181341636 and igr j181751530 ) was found ; with the exception of igr j181341636 , all these sources are variable in the ibis band and hence difficult to catch even at x - ray energies .",
    "this poses a problem in the search for their optical counterpart as `` standard '' follow - up observations will be useless unless a well defined monitoring strategy can be conceived and considerable amount of observing time obtained .    for most sources in the sample ,",
    "x - ray spectral properties have been obtained for the first time , while flux estimates ( either in case of positive detection or as upper limits ) have been reported for all objects / regions analysed .",
    "where possible , flux variability between observations have been obtained and discussed . as a final remark , we note that the results of this work confirm the key role played by follow - up observations with current x - ray telescopes and how it is important to encourage multiwaveband studies , in particular optical spectroscopy , which will help to definitely assess the nature of as yet unidentified high energy sources .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the simbad database operated at cds , strasbourg , france ; the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
