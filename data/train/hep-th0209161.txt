    "the derived category approach to b - type d - branes @xcite appears to be extremely powerful .",
    "it allows one to go beyond the picture of d - branes as vector bundles over submanifolds so that @xmath0-corrections can be correctly understood .",
    "for example , the fact that b - type d - branes must undergo monodromy as one moves about the moduli space of complexified khler forms can be expressed in the derived category language @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to try to classify which d - branes can become massless at a given point in the moduli space . again",
    "the language of derived categories will be invaluable .    in order for an object in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves to represent a d - brane",
    "it must be `` @xmath1-stable '' .",
    "criteria for @xmath1-stability have been discussed in @xcite although it is not clear that we yet have a mathematically rigorous algorithm for determining stability . despite this , in simple examples such as in the above references and @xcite one can compute stability with a fair degree of confidence . in particular if you have reason to believe that a certain set of a d - branes are stable at a given point in the moduli space then one can move along a path in moduli space and see how the spectrum of stable states changes .",
    "there is considerable evidence @xcite that such changes in @xmath1-stability depend only on the homotopy class of the path in the moduli space of conformal field theories .",
    "the fact that changes in @xmath1-stability _ do _ depend on the homotopy class of such paths was used in @xcite to `` derive '' kontsevich s picture of monodromy at least in the case of the quintic  threefold",
    ".    the moduli space of conformal field theories may be compactified by including the `` discriminant locus '' consisting of badly - behaved worldsheet theories .",
    "typically one expects such theories to be bad because some d - brane has become massless @xcite .",
    "indeed , the monodromy seen in @xcite around parts of this discriminant locus was intimately associated to massless d - branes .",
    "it is this link between massless d - branes and monodromy that we wish to study more deeply in this paper . in simple cases",
    "as one approaches a point in the discriminant locus , a single d - brane becomes massless .",
    "of more interest to us is the case where an infinite number become massless",
    ".    in @xcite one of the authors studied components of the discriminant locus corresponding to what was called `` ez - transformations '' .",
    "namely if one has a  threefold @xmath2 with some complex subspace @xmath3 , there may be a point in khler moduli space where @xmath3 collapses to a complex subspace @xmath4 of lower dimension than @xmath3 .",
    "we will see that it is then _ the derived category of @xmath4 _ that describes the massless d - branes associated to this transformation .",
    "a particular autoequivalence was naturally associated to a particular ez - transformation and it was conjectured in @xcite that such an autoequivalence resulted from the associated monodromy .",
    "we will call this conjecture the `` ez - monodromy conjecture '' .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to justify this conjecture .",
    "because of the nature of our understanding of d - branes and string theory it will not be possible to rigorously _ prove _ any hard theorems about d - branes .",
    "instead we will have to play with a number of conjectures whose interdependence leads to considerable evidence of the validity of the overall story .",
    "in particular , on the one hand we have the ez - monodromy conjecture and , on the other hand , we have our conjecture concerning which d - branes become massless .",
    "these two conjectures are interlinked by @xmath1-stability as we discuss in section [ s : mon ] .",
    "in particular , in section [ ss : single ] we discuss an older conjecture concerning single massless d - branes . in section [ ss : gen ]",
    "we then review a framework for the more general case which is linked to the simpler case in section [ ss : new ] for a particular example .",
    "the physical interpretation of the general case is then given in section [ ss : int ] .",
    "the link discussed in section [ ss : new ] between the simple case of a single d - brane becoming massless and an infinite number becoming massless depends upon a mathematical result which is derived in section [ s : comp ] .",
    "this section is more technical than the other sections and may be omitted by the reader if need be .",
    "that said , it shows how the sophisticated methods of derived categories are directly relevant to the physics of d - branes .    in section [ s : app ]",
    "we discuss a natural hierarchy of cases .",
    "the familiar `` conifold''-like situation arises where @xmath4 is a point and only one soliton becomes massless . if @xmath4 has dimension one then the derived category of @xmath4 has more structure .",
    "this case corresponds to seiberg ",
    "witten theory of some nonabelian gauge group .",
    "we study an explicit example of this elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the case where @xmath4 has complex dimension two is more complicated as the derived category now has a rich structure .",
    "we show that it appears to be similar to the spectrum of massless d - branes one gets from a decompactification .",
    "we also see that it demonstrates how 2-branes wrapped around a 2-torus can become massless . at first sight",
    "this appears to contradict t - duality but we will see that this is not actually the case .    finally , for completeness , in section [ ss : exof ] we discuss the case of an exoflop which is awkward to fit into our general classification but still yields a simple result .",
    "b - type d - branes on @xmath2 correspond to objects in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a given object @xmath5 is represented by a complex .",
    "we may then construct another object @xmath6 $ ] by shifting this complex @xmath7 places to the left . such a shift or",
    "`` translation '' is a global symmetry of physics if it is applied simultaneously to all objects @xcite .",
    "relative shifts are significant  an open string stretched between @xmath5 and @xmath8 is not equivalent to an open string stretched between @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",
    "we would like to consider the case of moving to a point in moduli space where a single physical d - brane @xmath5 becomes massless . because of the global shift symmetry all of its translates @xmath6 $ ] are equally massless .",
    "thus an infinite number of objects in @xmath10 are becoming massless even though only one d - brane counts towards any physical effects of this masslessness as it would be computed by strominger @xcite for example .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1-stability in @xcite showed that monodromy is intimately associated to massless d - branes .",
    "this should not be surprising since monodromy can only occur around the discriminant and the discriminant is associated with singularities in the conformal field theory associated with massless solitons @xcite .",
    "consider an oriented open string @xmath11 stretched between two d - branes in a  threefold @xmath2 . in the derived category language",
    "this is written as a morphism between two objects in @xmath10 @xmath12 these two objects may or may not form a bound state according to the mass of the open string @xmath11 . if @xmath11 is tachyonic then we have a bound state  la sen @xcite .",
    "( as we emphasize shortly @xmath5 is really an anti - brane in such a bound state . )",
    "a real number is defined modulo some integer such as 6 @xcite .",
    "periodicity can also appear , if desired , in floer cohomology ( see @xcite for example ) which is supposedly mirror to the structure we are considering . for simplicity",
    "we ignore such a possibility .",
    "to take such an effect into account one should probably quotient the derived category by such translations . ]",
    "( dubbed a `` grade '' in @xcite ) @xmath13 is associated to each stable d - brane .",
    "we assume @xmath13 varies continuously over the moduli space and is defined mod 2 by the central charge @xmath4 : @xmath14 the precise definition of @xmath13 is discussed at length in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the mass squared of the open string in ( [ eq : fab ] ) is then proportional to @xmath15 allowing the stability of this bound state to be determined .",
    "one of the key features of the derived category which makes it so useful for the study of solitons is the way that bound states are described using _",
    "distinguished triangles_. the open string @xmath11 between @xmath5 and @xmath8 is best represented in the context of a distinguished triangle @xmath16|{[1]}&\\\\ \\mathsf{a}\\ar[rr]^f&&\\mathsf{b}.\\ar[ul ] }    \\label{eq : abc}\\ ] ] the `` @xmath17 $ ] '' represents the fact that one must shift one place left when performing the corresponding map .",
    "the object @xmath18 , which is equivalent to the `` mapping cone '' @xmath19 , is then potentially a bound state of @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath8 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , @xmath21 $ ] should be thought of as an anti-@xmath5 .",
    "the triangle also tells us that @xmath8 is potentially a bound state of @xmath5 and @xmath18 .",
    "equally @xmath5 is a bound state of @xmath8 and @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the `` @xmath17 $ ] '' could be interpreted as keeping track of which brane should be treated as an anti - brane .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 copes so well with anti - branes demonstrates its power to analyze d - branes . the other approach , namely k - theory , should be considered the derived category s weaker cousin since it only knows about d - brane _ charge _ !",
    "now suppose that @xmath5 is stable and becomes massless at a particular point @xmath23 in the moduli space .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that the _ only _ massless d - branes at @xmath23 are of the form @xmath24 $ ] for any @xmath25 .",
    "let us take a generic complex plane with polar coordinates @xmath26 passing through @xmath23 at the origin and assume that @xmath27 behaves as @xmath28 near @xmath23 for @xmath29 some real and positive constant .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath27 has a simple zero at @xmath23 .",
    "suppose @xmath8 does not have vanishing mass .",
    "it follows that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are equal at @xmath23 and nonzero .",
    "in particular if we circle the point @xmath23 by varying @xmath32 , these central charges will be constant close to @xmath23 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath18 can be a marginally bound state of anti-@xmath5 and @xmath8 near @xmath23 , then , according to the rules of @xcite , we have @xmath33 near @xmath23 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite ( [ eq : abc ] ) including the differences in the @xmath13 s for the open strings ( i.e. , sides of the triangle ) to give @xmath16_(0.4){1+a - b+\\frac{\\theta}{\\pi}}|{[1]}&\\\\ \\mathsf{a}\\ar[rr]^f_{b - a-\\frac{\\theta}{\\pi } } & &    \\mathsf{b},\\ar[ul]_0 }    \\label{eq : abcg}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "the stability of a given vertex of this triangle depends upon the number on the opposite side being less than 1 . by `` stability ''",
    "we mean relative to this triangle only .",
    "a given d - brane may decay by other channels .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 becomes stable for @xmath37 while @xmath8 becomes unstable for @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath5 is always stable near @xmath23 consistent with our assumptions .    based on this idea that we `` gain '' @xmath18 and",
    "`` lose '' @xmath8 as @xmath32 increases , we can try to formulate a picture for monodromy around @xmath23 .",
    "the meaning of monodromy is that after traversing this loop in the moduli space we should be able to relabel the d - branes in such a way as to restore the physics we had before we traversed the loop .",
    "it is important to note that monodromy is not really the statement that a certain d - brane manifestly `` becomes '' another d - brane explicitly as we move through the moduli space .",
    "it is much more accurately described as a relabeling process .",
    "since stability is a physical quality , we are forced to relabel @xmath8 since it has decayed .",
    "the obvious candidate in the above case is to call it @xmath18 .",
    "thus monodromy would transform @xmath8 into @xmath18 .",
    "life can be more complicated than this however .",
    "if we have an open string @xmath39 , then , since @xmath33 when @xmath8 decays to @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath18 will immediately decay further to @xmath41 plus another @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "suppose @xmath5 is `` spherical '' in the sense of @xcite which means @xmath42)=\\c$ ] for @xmath43 or 3 , and @xmath42)=0 $ ] otherwise .",
    "this condition is always satisfied in the context of this subsection  i.e. , only @xmath5 and its translates become massless . a long exact sequence associated to ( [ eq : abc ] ) then implies @xmath44 it follows that this second decay will occur if @xmath45 .",
    "iterating this process one sees that @xmath8 will decay splitting off an @xmath20 $ ] a total of @xmath46 times .",
    "finally we should also worry about homomorphisms between @xmath8 and @xmath24 $ ] for other values of @xmath25 .",
    "we refer to the example in section 4 of @xcite for a detailed example of exactly how this happens in a fairly nontrivial example .",
    "all said , allowing for all these decays , @xmath18 becomes a number of @xmath5 s ( probably shifted ) together with @xmath47^{b_1}\\oplus          \\mathsf{a}[-2]^{b_2}\\oplus\\ldots\\right)\\to\\mathsf{b}\\right ) ,      \\label{eq : aaz}\\ ] ] where @xmath48,\\mathsf{b})\\\\        & = \\dim\\ext^n(\\mathsf{a},\\mathsf{b } ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the cone ( [ eq : aaz ] ) may be written more compactly as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the complex of @xmath51-vector spaces @xmath52 we refer to @xcite for further explanation of the notation .",
    "we can also write more heuristically @xmath53    interpreted navely , we have shown that , upon increasing @xmath32 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , an object @xmath8 will decay and a canonically associated object @xmath56 will become stable and appear as one of the decay products of @xmath8 .",
    "what is desired however is monodromy _ once _ around @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath32 should only increase by @xmath57 .",
    "we will indeed claim that monodromy once around @xmath23 replaces @xmath8 by @xmath56 .    for some objects , increasing @xmath32 by only @xmath57 ( at the appropriate starting point ) will cause the complete decay of @xmath8 into @xmath56 .",
    "thanks to its rather simple cohomology , this always happens for @xmath58 , the structure sheaf of a point @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the relabeling process under monodromy should replace @xmath8 by @xmath56 .",
    "there are undoubtedly many other objects @xmath60 under which this increase in @xmath32 by only @xmath57 would not induce the entire decay to @xmath61 .",
    "this does nt matter however , we can still leave physics invariant by relabeling @xmath60 by @xmath61 .",
    "for example in an extreme case , both @xmath60 and @xmath61 may be stable with respect to the above triangle both before and after increasing @xmath32 by @xmath57 .",
    "it is therefore harmless to relabel one of these states as the other .    well , it is fine saying that it is harmless to relabel @xmath60 by @xmath61 , but why are we _ forced _ to relabel like this ?",
    "the reason is that we know that physics must be completely invariant under monodromy which implies that the relabeling must amount to an _ autoequivalence _ of @xmath10 .",
    "one can indeed show that @xmath62 defines an autoequivalence , this transformation can be written as a fourier ",
    "mukai transform removing this objection .",
    "] of @xmath10 so long as @xmath5 is spherical @xcite .",
    "what s more , as argued in @xcite , it is pretty well the _ only _ autoequivalence that works . to be more precise ,",
    "once we have argued that the specific objects @xmath58 undergo monodromy given by @xmath62 then all other objects must undergo the same monodromy up to some possible multiplication by some fixed line bundle @xmath63 .    note",
    "that the central charge @xmath4 is also a physical quantity .",
    "insisting that monodromy acts correctly in this case amounts to insisting that the d - brane `` charges '' @xmath64 transform under monodromy .",
    "this is precisely the same monodromy on @xmath65 that one deduces from mirror symmetry as in @xcite .",
    "this determines that the above line bundle @xmath63 is trivial ( in a considerably overdetermined way ! ) .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite for example ) that @xmath62 then induces the correct transformation on these charges  indeed this was the reason why @xmath62 was conjectured as the monodromy action in the first place @xcite !",
    "it is worth noting that in some special cases the transformation @xmath62 has nothing to do with decay .",
    "consider how the spherical object @xmath5 itself transforms : @xmath66 , \\end{split }    \\label{eq : ocon}\\ ] ] where we use the convention of @xcite by underlining the zero position when necessary .",
    "such a transformation can not be argued from @xmath1-stability however .",
    "clearly an open string between @xmath5 and itself ( perhaps translated ) can not have a mass that depends upon some angle as we orbit the conifold point as clearly the mass is constant .",
    "instead one could argue that the transform ( [ eq : ocon ] ) occurs simply because @xmath27 has a simple zero at the conifold point and thus @xmath67 shifts by @xmath68 as we loop around the conifold point .",
    "then we can apply the rule @xmath69)=\\varphi(\\mathsf{a})+n$ ] from @xcite .. since monodromy is a relabeling process , one is free to do this , but it looks unnatural from the perspective of associating monodromy with @xmath1-stability . ]    we must therefore view ( [ eq : cone1 ] ) as being motivated by @xmath1-stability for _ most _ but not all of the objects in @xmath10 . note that the fact that the obvious physical requirement that monodromy be an autoequivalence of @xmath10 can force ( [ eq : cone1 ] ) to be the required transform for _ all _ the objects in @xmath10 once @xmath1-stability has established it for a few elements .",
    "this was the basis of the proof in the case of the quintic in @xcite .",
    "anyway , all said we have motivated the following conjecture ( which , in perhaps a slightly different form , is due to kontsevich @xcite , horja @xcite and morrison @xcite ) :    if we loop around a component of the discriminant locus associated with a single d - brane @xmath5 ( and thus its translates ) becoming massless then this results in a relabeling of d - branes given by an autoequivalence of the derived category in which @xmath8 becomes @xmath70 .",
    "[ conj : a ]    this transformation was also motivated by its relation to mirror symmetry and studied at length by seidel and thomas @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask what happens more generally , i.e. , if more than just a single d - brane @xmath5 becomes massless . in order",
    "to answer this we need to set up a general description of how one might analyze monodromy in a multi - dimensional moduli space .",
    "there are two paradigms for monodromy  both of which are useful :    1 .",
    "the discriminant locus decomposes into a sum of irreducible divisors .",
    "pick some base point in the moduli space and loop around a component of the discriminant `` close '' to the base point .",
    "2 .   restrict attention to a special rational curve @xmath71 in the moduli space .",
    "this rational curve contains two `` phase limit points '' , in a sense to be described below , and a single point in the discriminant .",
    "the loop in question is around this unique discriminant point .    in the case of the one parameter models , such as the quintic",
    ", these two paradigms coincide .",
    "the moduli space _ is _ @xmath72 and the discriminant locus is a single point .",
    "if a component of the discriminant intersects @xmath71 transversely then we can again have agreement between these two pictures of monodromy .",
    "in general the discriminant need not intersect @xmath71 transversely  a fact we use to our advantage in section [ ss : new ] .",
    "we now recall the relationship between the discriminant locus and phases as analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the following is a very rapid review",
    ". please refer to the references for more details .    to make the discussion easier",
    "we suffer a little loss of generality and assume we are in the `` batyrev - like '' @xcite case @xmath2 being a hypersurface in a toric variety . the data for @xmath2 is then presented in the form of a point set @xmath73 which is the intersection of some convex polytope with some lattice @xmath74 .",
    "see @xcite , for example , for more details of this standard construction .",
    "the conformal field theory associated to this data then has a phase structure where each `` phase '' is associated to a regular triangulation of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the real vector space in which the khler form lives is naturally divided into a `` secondary fan '' of all possible phases .",
    "one cone of this fan is the khler cone for @xmath2 where we have the `` '' phase .",
    "mirror to @xmath2 , @xmath75 is described as the zero - set of a polynomial @xmath76 in many variables .",
    "the points in @xmath73 are associated one - to - one with each monomial in @xmath76 .",
    "thus the data @xmath73 is associated to deformations of complex structure of @xmath75 via the monomial - divisor mirror map @xcite .    if we model the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath75 by the space of coefficients in @xmath76 , then the discriminant locus can be computed by the failure of @xmath76 to be transversal",
    ". this can be mapped back to the space of complexified khler forms on @xmath2 .",
    "the result is that part of the discriminant asymptotically lives in each wall dividing adjacent phases in the space of khler forms .",
    "that is to say , if we tune the @xmath77-field suitably we can always hit a bad conformal field theory as we pass from one phase to another .",
    "thus we may associate singular conformal field theories with phase transitions .",
    "the discriminant itself is generically reducible .",
    "the combinatorial structure of this reduction has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "in particular , any time an @xmath25-dimensional face of the convex hull of the set @xmath73 contains more than @xmath78 points , the resulting linear relationship between these points yields a component of @xmath79 .",
    "one may then follow an algorithm presented in @xcite to compute the explicit form of each component .",
    "the general picture then is of a discriminant with many components with each component having `` fingers '' which separate the phases from each other .",
    "each phase transition is associated with fingers from one or more component of @xmath79 .",
    "torically each maximal cone in the secondary fan is associated to a point in the moduli space which gives the limit point in the `` deep interior '' of the associated phase .",
    "the real codimension - one wall between two maximal cones corresponds to a rational curve @xmath71 passing through two such limit points .",
    "the rational curve @xmath71 will intersect the discriminant locus in one point as promised earlier in this section .",
    "one component of @xmath79 is distinguished  it corresponds to the case of viewing the full convex hull as a face of itself .",
    "this is called the `` primary '' component of @xmath79 .",
    "closely tied in with conjecture  [ conj : a ] ( and at least partially attributed to the same authors ) is the following conjecture    at any point on the primary component of @xmath79 ( reached by a suitable path from a suitable basepoint ) the 6-brane associated with the structure sheaf @xmath80 and its translates become massless . at a generic point",

    "let us concentrate on the walls of the khler cone .",

    "we will explain exactly what happens in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is worth speculating that such analysis of seiberg  witten theory may shed some light on the `` local mirror symmetry '' story of papers such as @xcite .",
    "the massless b - type d - branes associated with the derived category of @xmath4 may be related to the a - type d - brane story of @xcite by some kind of local homological mirror symmetry .",
    "there is only one possibility , namely @xmath339 is an elliptic fibration over @xmath4 .",
    "we will denote this fibration @xmath340 .",
    "let @xmath341 correspond to the skyscraper sheaf of a point @xmath342 .",
    "then @xmath343 corresponds to the structure sheaf of an elliptic fibre @xmath344 over @xmath345 .",
    "let us consider the case where the size of @xmath108 becomes infinite . according to our rules then",
    ", the 2-brane wrapping @xmath346 should become massless when we hit the discriminant moving from the large radius phase to the phase where the elliptic fibres such as @xmath346 have collapsed . at first sight",
    "this looks peculiar .",
    "one does not usually expect a 2-brane wrapped around a 2-torus to become massless for a particular radius of the torus !",
    "actually we will argue that this indeed happens and that it is when the 2-torus is zero sized that the 2-brane becomes massless .",
    "why t - duality does nt interfere with this will become apparent .",
    "as a specific example let @xmath2 be given by the following equation in @xmath347 : @xmath348 this has a quotient singularity which may be resolved with an exceptional divisor @xmath168 .",
    "one may regard @xmath349 $ ] as homogeneous coordinates on this @xmath350 .",
    "fixing a point on @xmath108 one then has an elliptic fibre @xmath346 given by a sextic in @xmath351 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for more details about such fibrations .",
    "the moduli space of interest to us regards the area of @xmath346 .",
    "this area is infinite for the  limit point and shrinks down as we approach the other limit point . for a more precise statement",
    "let us consider the mirror @xmath352 of @xmath346 given by the following equation in @xmath351 : @xmath353 varying the size of @xmath346 is then mirror to varying the complex structure of @xmath352 by varying @xmath354 .",
    "going through the usual story of solving the picard ",
    "fuchs equation and using the mirror map to map back to the @xmath355 plane for @xmath346 we obtain the shaded region in figure  [ f : wl ] .",
    "the result is that for the  limit point we have @xmath356 and thus @xmath357 as expected . for the other limit point @xmath358 and @xmath359 .",
    "the discriminant is given by @xmath360 and corresponds to @xmath361 , i.e. , @xmath346 has zero area .",
    "this is where the 2-branes wrapping @xmath346 ( and all the other d - branes given by @xmath137 for @xmath341 ) become massless .",
    "so what about t - duality for @xmath346 ?",
    "note that the moduli space in figure  [ f : wl ] corresponds to _ two _ fundamental regions for the action of @xmath362 on the upper - half plane .",
    "t - duality should map the point at @xmath360 to the point at @xmath363 .",
    "it is important to remember however that t - duality does not act only upon @xmath346  one must also shift the string dilaton by an amount related to the resulting change in the area of the torus . as such ,",
    "the point at @xmath360 is related to @xmath363 only with the string coupling shifted off to infinity , implying again that the d - brane mass is zero .    therefore if we fix the dilaton to be a finite value we can not use t - duality to relate @xmath360 to any large radius torus .",
    "this explains why we really do have a massless 2-brane appearing wrapped around a zero - sized torus .",
    "note also that if we allow the base @xmath350 to have finite size then the t - duality group ceases to exist anyway as in @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is a t - duality relating @xmath363 to @xmath360 shows that their physics must be similar .",
    "in particular @xmath360 must be an infinite distance away in the moduli space .",
    "indeed , in many respects the spectrum of stable d - branes at @xmath360 , coming from the derived category of @xmath168 , must be similar to the spectrum one would see upon going to a large radius limit",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate this in more detail and generality .",
    "finally let us note that not all the walls of the khler cone correspond directly to some subspace @xmath3 collapsing to @xmath4 .",
    "even so , it appears that we can still fit many , if not all examples into the general ez language .",
    "we illustrate this with an `` exoflop '' .",
    "let @xmath2 be the degree 12 hypersurface in @xmath364 .",
    "its mirror , @xmath75 , then has defining equation @xmath365 and we may use the following algebraic coordinates on the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath75 : @xmath366    we have chosen coordinates so that the khler cone of @xmath2 appears naturally as a positive octant in the secondary fan . in particular",
    "this means that the 3 rational curves in the moduli space connecting the large radius limit to each of the three neighbouring phase limit points are given by setting @xmath367 , @xmath368 or @xmath369 respectively .",
    "the discriminant has two components given by @xmath370 and @xmath371    the phase transition of interest occurs for the rational curve @xmath71 for which @xmath369 . for small @xmath101 we are in the  phase .",
    "for large @xmath101 the  @xmath2 undergoes an `` exoflop '' @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath2 becomes reducible with one component consisting of a threefold with a singularity .",
    "the other component consists of a fibration of a landau  ginzburg orbifold theory over a @xmath96 .",
    "these components intersect at a point which is the singularity in the threefold component .",
    "this then is not an ez transformation .",
    "note however that the discriminant @xmath98 intersects @xmath71 transversely at @xmath372 and so the monodromy within @xmath71 is exactly given by monodromy around the primary component of the discriminant . therefore exactly one d - brane becomes massless at the transition point  the d6-brane wrapping @xmath2 .",
    "this exoflop transition is equivalent , as far as monodromy is concerned , to an ez transformation with @xmath339 and @xmath4 given by a point .",
    "this is not entirely surprising given the following .",
    "classically one would describe the exoflop wall of the khler cone as a wall where @xmath373 .",
    "thus the classical volume of @xmath2 is going to zero , even though the volume of some surfaces and curves within @xmath2 , as measured by the khler form , do not vanish .",
    "since the volume of @xmath2 vanishes , one should expect the d6-brane to have vanishing mass .",
    "the fact that no other d - branes become massless is not obvious",
    ".    it would be interesting to show that all phase transitions give rise to monodromies that can be associated with ez transformations .",
