    "et al._@xmath14 in their fractal landscape or dna walk model . the dna walk@xmath14 was defined as that the walker steps `` up '' if a pyrimidine ( @xmath7 or @xmath9 ) occurs at position @xmath15 along the dna chain , while the walker steps `` down '' if a purine ( @xmath6 or @xmath8 ) occurs at position @xmath15 .",

    "a subsequent work by prabhu and claverie@xmath17 also substantially corroborates these results .",

    "et al._@xmath20 showed that long - range correlation appears mainly in noncoding dna using all the dna sequences available .",
    "based on equal - symbol correlation , voss@xmath21 showed a power law behaviour for the sequences studied regardless of the proportion of intron contents .",
    "these studies add to the controversy about the possible presence of correlation in the entire dna or only in the noncoding dna . from a different angle ,",
    "fractal analysis is a relative new analytical technique that has proven useful in revealing complex patterns in natural objects .",
    "et al._@xmath22 considered the global fractal dimensions of human dna sequences treated as pseudorandom walks .    in the above studies , the authors only considered short or long dna segments . since the first complete genome of the free - living bacterium _",
    "mycoplasma genitalium _ was sequenced in 1995@xmath23 , an ever - growing number of complete genomes has been deposited in public databases .",
    "the availability of complete genomes induces the possibility to establish some global properties of these sequences .",
    "vieira@xmath24 carried out a low - frequency analysis of the complete dna of 13 microbial genomes and showed that their fractal behaviour does not always prevail through the entire chain and the autocorrelation functions have a rich variety of behaviours including the presence of anti - persistence .",
    "yu and wang@xmath25 proposed a time series model of coding sequences in complete genomes . for fuller details on the number , size and ordering of genes along the chromosome , one can refer to part 5 of lewin@xmath26 .",
    "one may ignore the composition of the four kinds of bases in coding and noncoding segments and only consider the global structure of the complete genomes or long dna sequences .",
    "provata and almirantis @xmath27 proposed a fractal cantor pattern of dna .",
    "they mapped coding segments to filled regions and noncoding segments to empty regions of a random cantor set and then calculated the fractal dimension of this set .",
    "they found that the coding / noncoding partition in dna sequences of lower organisms is homogeneous - like , while in the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal .",
    "this result does nt seem refined enough to distinguish bacteria because the fractal dimensions of bacteria given by them@xmath28 are all the same . the classification and evolution relationship of bacteria is one of the most important problems in dna research .",
    "yu and anh@xmath29 proposed a time series model based on the global structure of the complete genome and considered three kinds of length sequences . after calculating the correlation dimensions and hurst exponents",
    ", it was found that one can get more information from this model than that of fractal cantor pattern .",
    "some results on the classification and evolution relationship of bacteria were found@xmath30 .",
    "the correlation property of these length sequences has been discussed@xmath31 .",
    "although statistical analysis performed directly on dna sequences has yielded some success , there has been some indication that this method is not powerful enough to amplify the difference between a dna sequence and a random sequence as well as to distinguish dna sequences themselves in more details@xmath32 .",
    "one needs more powerful global and visual methods .",
    "for this purpose , hao _",
    "et al._@xmath32 proposed a visualisation method based on counting and coarse - graining the frequency of appearance of substrings with a given length .",
    "they called it the _ portrait _ of an organism .",
    "they found that there exist some fractal patterns in the portraits which are induced by avoiding and under - represented strings .",
    "the fractal dimension of the limit set of portraits was also discussed@xmath33 .",
    "there are other graphical methods of sequence patterns , such as chaos game representation@xmath34 .    in the portrait representation , hao _ et al._@xmath32 used squares to represent substrings and discrete colour grades to represent the frequencies of the substrings in the complete genome .",
    "it is difficult to know the accurate value of the frequencies of the substrings from the portrait representation . in order to improve it , in this paper",
    "we use subintervals in one - dimensional space to represent substrings and then we can directly obtain an accurate histogram of the substrings in the complete genome .",
    "we then view the histogram as a measure , which we call the _ measure representation _ of the complete genome .",
    "when the measure representation is viewed as a time series , a spectral analysis can be carried out .",
    "global calculations neglect the fact that dna sequences are highly inhomogeneous .",
    "multifractal analysis is a useful way to characterise the spatial inhomogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns@xmath35 .",
    "multifractal analysis was initially proposed to treat turbulence data . in recent years",
    "it has been applied successfully in many different fields including time series analysis@xmath36 and financial modelling ( see anh _ et al . _",

    "application of the methodology is undertaken in section 4 on a number of representative chromosomes .",
    "a discussion of the empirical results and some conclusions are drawn in section 5 , where we also address the use of the multifractal technology in the classification problem of bacteria .",
    "we call any string made of @xmath2 letters from the set @xmath39 a @xmath2-string . for a given @xmath2 there are in total @xmath40 different @xmath2-strings . in order to count the number of each kind of @xmath2-strings in a given dna sequence",
