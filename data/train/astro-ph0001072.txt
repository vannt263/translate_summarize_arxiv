    "this paper is the first in a series on the stellar populations of local field and group elliptical galaxies based on the high - quality spectral data of gonzlez ( 1993 ; g93 ) .",
    "the present paper concentrates on deriving improved stellar population parameters by correcting existing population models for the effects of _ non - solar abundance ratios_. the major roadblock to population synthesis models of elliptical galaxies is the fact that the effects of age and metallicity are _ nearly degenerate _ in the spectra of old stellar populations ( @xcite , 1973 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was early noted that certain spectral features are more sensitive to age than metallicity ( e.g. , the balmer lines [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] , and @xmath144077 [ @xcite ] ) , and hope grew that such features might be able to break the degeneracy if accurately calibrated .",
    "( at about the same time , several workers were also using balmer lines to discover strong bursts of star formation in so - called `` e+a '' or `` post - starburst '' galaxies [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] , but these applications always implicitly assumed solar metallicity . )    our ability to decouple age and metallicity in integrated spectra has greatly improved over the last decade , due to three developments . in the late 1980 s ,",
    "interior models of super - solar - metallicity stellar evolution became available ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "next , the lick / ids stellar absorption - line survey provided empirical polynomial fitting functions for a set of standardized absorption - line indices as a function of stellar temperature , gravity , and metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , an extensive grid of theoretical model atmospheres and stellar flux distributions was provided by kurucz ( 1992 ) for stars over a wide range of temperatures and metallicities . with these three ingredients",
    ", it finally became possible to compute absorption - line strengths from first principles for single - burst stellar populations ( ssps ) of a given age and metallicity ( @xcite , 1994 ) .",
    "using such models , worthey showed that the age - metallicity degeneracy was actually worse than suspected : a factor of _ two _ uncertainty in the metallicity of a galaxy mimics a factor of _ three _ uncertainty in its age at fixed color or metal - line strength , the so - called `` 3/2 law '' .",
    "the law implies that such commonly used `` age '' indicators as colors and metal - line strengths are by themselves useless ( although they still are widely used ) . at the same time",
    ", the worthey models also provided a quantitative tool to break the degeneracy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a balmer index plotted versus a metal line ( or color ) yields a two - dimensional theoretical grid ; the equivalent single - burst age and metallicity for a population can be read off from its location in this grid .",
    "tests of the method on composite stellar populations will be demonstrated in trager et al .",
    "( 1999 ; paper ii ) , where it is shown that these single - stellar - population ( ssp ) equivalent parameters correspond approximately to the _ luminosity - weighted _",
    "vector addition of populations in the index diagrams .",
    "a galaxy s age determined from its integrated spectrum is thus quite sensitive to _ recent _ star formation , and hence to the epoch and strength of its last major dissipative merger or accretion event .",
    "while worthey models validated use of the balmer lines , they also showed that extremely accurate balmer data would be needed . to our knowledge ,",
    "the line - strength data of gonzlez ( 1993 ) are still the only published data on a _ diversified _ sample of local e galaxies that are adequate for this purpose . applying early worthey models to his data",
    ", gonzlez found that blue , weak - lined ellipticals in his sample tended to have young ages , while red , strong - lined ellipticals had older ages .",
    "in contrast , the metallicity spread was fairly small , less than a few tenths of a dex .",
    "this result seemed to imply ( g93 , @xcite ) that age was the major cause of the well known color / line - strength relation in the g93 sample , not metallicity as in the classic picture ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1973 ) .",
    "the large age spread in g93 galaxies was later confirmed by trager ( 1997 ) and by tantalo , chiosi & bressan ( 1998a ; tcb98 ) using later stellar population models .",
    "excellent line strengths have also been measured for e and s0 galaxies in the fornax cluster by kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) and kuntschner ( 1998 ) .",
    "fornax turns out to be the reverse of the g93 sample in showing a larger spread in metallicity than age ; the dense cluster environment of fornax may be the key difference .",
    "a goal of the present series of papers is to explore the relative importance of age versus metallicity in driving the color and line strength relations of ellipticals in different environments ( see paper ii ) .",
    "although the data of g93 shed hope on solving the age vs. metallicity problem , they brought another simmering problem to the fore , namely , non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "enhancement of mg relative to fe had been suggested by oconnell ( 1976 ) and peletier ( 1989 ) and shown to be widespread in the lick / ids ellipticals by worthey , faber & gonzlez ( 1992 ) .",
    "however , the high - quality data of g93 offered a great improvement for hard - to - measure weak fe lines , and , using them , trager ( 1997 ) showed that metallicities deduced from mg were indeed considerably higher than those deduced from fe .",
    "other elements such as na , c , n , and possibly o are also probably enhanced in giant ellipticals ( @xcite ) . because the worthey models are not designed for non - solar abundance ratios , applying them to different metal line features in elliptical spectra gives inconsistent ages and , especially , abundances .",
    "the progress promised by the g93 data thus suddenly came to a full stop .",
    "the present paper addresses the problem of non - solar abundance ratios in a rough but hopefully satisfactory way . on the one hand ,",
    "the general effects of non - solar ratios on evolutionary isochrones are now beginning to be understood ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; bressan , priv .",
    "; see @xcite ) .",
    "second , the responses of nearly all the lick / ids indices to non - solar element ratios have been modeled by tripicco and bell ( 1995 ; tb95 ) .",
    "the latter prove crucial , and it is really these responses that open the way forward . using both inputs , reasonable corrections to the w94 indices for non - solar ratios can be estimated for the first time .",
    "the corrected models are used here to derive three ssp - equivalent population parameters for each galaxy  age , mean metallicity , and mean element `` enhancement ratio . ''",
    "future papers will use these parameters to study stellar populations as a function of galaxy type , determine correlations among age , metallicity , enhancement , and other variables , and measure radial population gradients .",
    "other groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have also attempted to interpret g93 data in terms of non - solar abundance ratios , but their approaches were more _ ad hoc_. inferred metallicities and enhancements both tend to be larger than what we find here .",
    "the most similar analysis so far is by tantalo , chiosi & bressan ( 1998a ; tcb98 ) , building on previous work by that group ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these authors use different response functions from ours ( and in fact do not correct the fe index at all for non - solar ratios ) . their results consequently differ , and a section is devoted to comparing our results to their work ( sec .",
    "[ sec : modeldep ] ) .",
    "we note briefly that balmer - line equivalent widths might be spuriously contaminated by light from blue horizontal - branch ( bhb ) stars or blue straggler stars ( bss ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these possibilities are discussed in section  [ sec : hbeta_age ] . to anticipate the conclusions , we believe that current data do not support the existence of _ large _ numbers of bhb and bss stars in giant elliptical galaxies , and",
    "we thus conclude that the ssp - equivalent ages derived here for both young and old ellipticals must be substantially correct",
    ". likewise , reduction of balmer indices by emission fill - in , though present , can not change the derived ages very much .",
    "thus , despite efforts , we have been unable to find any explanation for the wide range of balmer line strengths in the g93 galaxies other than a _ wide range of ssp - equivalent ages .",
    "_ this is our principal conclusion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec : data ] presents absorption - line data for the g93 galaxies .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] presents a brief description of the worthey ( 1994 ) models ; their extension to non - solar abundance ratios using the results of tb95 ; the final choice of elements for inclusion in the enhanced element group ; the method for determining the stellar population parameters from the models ; and the final population parameters for the g93 sample .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] briefly presents the parameters for the g93 , both central and global , and their distributions .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses the assumptions , in particular the use of @xmath0  as an age indicator , and examines all known uncertainties in the age , metallicity , and abundance - ratio scales and zeropoints .",
    "section  [ sec : others ] presents evidence from other absorption - line strength studies for the presence of intermediate - age stellar populations in elliptical galaxies ; it also compares in detail our results to those of tcb98 .",
    "two appendices discuss the effect of changing isochrones in the models and the effect of using different prescriptions for emission and velocity dispersion corrections to @xmath0 .",

    "indices measured for broad - line galaxies are therefore too weak compared to unbroadened standard stars .",
    "twfbg98 statistically corrected the lick / ids indices for this effect in the following way : individual stellar spectra of a variety of spectral types ( plus m  32 ) were convolved with gaussian broadening functions of increasing widths and their indices were remeasured . a smooth multiplicative correction as a function of velocity dispersion was determined separately for each index and applied to the galaxy data .",
    "g93 used a more sophisticated technique , taking advantage of the higher resolution and signal - to - noise of his data .",

    "g93 noted that [ ]  @xmath64 are clearly detectable in about half of the nuclei in his sample and that most of these galaxies also have detectable @xmath0  emission ( see his figure 4.10 ) .",

    "the w94 models are reviewed briefly here , and the reader is referred to worthey ( 1994 ) for more details .    the models incorporate three ingredients : stellar evolutionary isochrones , a stellar sed library , and absorption - line strengths . from the bottom of the main sequence to the base of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) , the models use the isochrones of vandenberg and collaborators ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "metal - rich stars in the lick / ids library are a random sample of metal - rich stars in the solar neighborhood ; since evidence suggests that such stars have essentially solar ratios of o , mg , na , and other key elements relative to fe ( @xcite ) , we assume that the line - strengths produced by the metal - rich models of w94 reflect _ solar - abundance ratios_.    to construct a model of a given age and metallicity , the appropriate stellar isochrone is first selected .",
    "each star on the isochrone is assigned an sed from the flux library and a set of absorption - line strengths from the lick / ids fitting functions .",
    "final model outputs are the integrated fluxed sed ( from which colors and magnitudes can be derived ) and absorption - line strengths on the lick / ids system .",
    "the ability of the w94 models to break the age - metallicity degeneracy is illustrated in figures  [ fig : re8 m ] and [ fig : re2 m ] , which plot @xmath1  and @xmath2  versus @xmath0  for the g93 galaxies .",
    "model grids from w94 are overplotted .",
    "both line strength pairs break the degeneracy , but @xmath2-@xmath0  does so more than @xmath1-@xmath0  because @xmath2  is less temperature sensitive than @xmath1 .",
    "metallicities inferred from @xmath1  are clearly higher than from @xmath2 , reflecting the probable element enhancement in [ mg / fe ] .",
    "low-@xmath0  galaxies tend to fall off the grid to high ages in the @xmath2-@xmath0  diagram , especially through the @xmath120 aperture ( figure 2b ) .",
    "most of this effect is removed when @xmath2  is corrected for depressed [ fe / h ] ( see below ) , and any small remainder can be attributed to use of the g93 @xmath0  velocity corrections ( instead of twfbg98 ) and , in a few galaxies , to possible residual , uncorrected @xmath0  emission ( see appendix  [ app : emsigcorr ] ) .      adjusting the w94 models for non - solar ratios involves two steps .",
    "first , one must compute new evolutionary tracks in a fully self - consistent manner using new interior opacities , reaction rates , and atmospheric boundary conditions that faithfully reflect the altered compositions .",
    "second , one must compute new absorption - line indices .",
    "part one is less developed in the literature but also proves to be less important ; we discuss it below .",
    "part two , the indices , could in principle be handled by observing populations of stars with known non - solar ratios and deriving empirical fitting functions for them .",
    "for example , borges et al .  ( 1995 ) derived a fitting function for mg@xmath62  versus [ mg / fe ] using local dwarf and subgiant stars ( this was the function adopted by tcb98 for their population models ) ; and weiss , peletier & mateucci ( 1995 ) attempted to correct mg@xmath62  and @xmath2  using galactic bulge stars studied by rich ( 1988 ) .",
    "however , it is hard to identify groups of stars with exactly the same ( known ) enhancements , and it is even more difficult to _ vary _ the pattern of element abundance enhancements in a controlled way using real stars . for these reasons , a theoretical approach is recommended , and we have chosen to utilize the computations of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) , who re - computed all of the lick / ids spectral indices from a grid of theoretical stellar seds and atmospheres with varying abundance ratios . for three sample locations on an old stellar isochrone ,",
    "tb95 tabulate the response of each lick / ids index to separate enhancements @xmath121}=+0.3 $ ] dex for the elements @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "these response functions are the basis for our corrections to the indices for non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "note that , because we use the response functions _ differentially _ , we are insensitive to any zeropoint uncertainties that the tb95 indices may have ( which are in any case known to be small , as tb95 showed by comparing to real stars ) .",

    "the assumption that we are measuring real ages of stellar populations rests on the further assumption that @xmath0  light is coming purely from main - sequence and red giant - branch stars .",
    "we now discuss three scenarios whereby @xmath0  might be contaminated by light from other sources .",
    "\\(1 ) _ fill - in by emission _",
    "( see section  [ sec : emission ] ) .",
    "the extreme form of this hypothesis says that _ all _ ellipticals are actually young and that the apparent large age spread is due entirely to variable amounts of infill by emission .",
    "this extreme view is strictly ruled out by numerous observational studies of emission in elliptical galaxies .",
    "for example ,",
    "g93 s plot of precision continuum - subtracted spectra ( g93 , figure 4.10 ) shows that emission is nearly always less than a few tenths of an  , not nearly large enough to create the observed age spread . in the same vein , carrasco et al .",

    "the final point is that @xmath0correlates strongly both with mg@xmath62 and @xmath960 ( g93 ; @xcite ) , inconsistent with emission fill - in , which varies unpredictably from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "a more reasonable hypothesis is that _ errors _ in the emission correction contribute noticeably to the age spread .",
    "such errors were investigated in section  [ sec : emission ] , where we noted that scatter in the @xmath0/ [ ]  ratio would induce age errors of only @xmath964% for typical galaxies .",
    "an even more drastic test is presented in appendix  [ app : emsigcorr ] , which shows that neglecting the emission correction altogether affects a few strong- [ ]  galaxies but makes at most small changes in the broad age distribution .",
    "\\(2 ) _ contamination by blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs)_. bhb stars are not present in the standard worthey ( 1994 ) models , which assume red clumps for old metal - rich populations .",
    "bhb stars might come from an anomalous bhb population associated with the metal - rich stars , or from contamination by a normal bhb associated with a subordinate metal - poor population . by `` bhb , ''",
    "we mean blue horizontal branches similar to m  92 , which would contribute significantly to the light at 40005500  , not the extremely hot horizontal branches identified in populations like ngc 6791 ( @xcite ) which contribute primarily to 1500   flux and the `` uv upturn '' ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy m  32 can be used to rule out the hypothesis that bhbs alone are responsible for the large @xmath0  excesses seen in _",
    "high_-@xmath0  ellipticals .",
    "it can be shown that nearly the _ entire _ red clump in m  32 would have to be moved to a bhb at approximately spectral type mid - f to explain its high @xmath0  index ( @xcite ) ; this is strictly ruled out by blue spectral indices ( @xcite , 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , the hb has actually been detected in the outer part of m  32 by hst ( @xcite ) and is seen to be mostly red . extrapolating the g93 indices outward to this field and matching to w94 models there yields an excellent fit to both the integrated colors and the color of the rgb at this point ( @xcite ) , supporting the assumption that the hb is indeed red .",
    "the existence of a dominant bhb population in metal - rich ellipticals is not expected on astrophysical grounds .",
    "if ellipticals were _ very _ old ( i.e. , @xmath965 gyr , as lee 1994 has suggested ) , then bhbs could conceivably be significant components , but such large ages violate current constraints on the age of the universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "no _ solar metallicity _",
    "cluster populations in the milky way have bhbs ( @xcite ) , although we note that rich et al .",

    "however , these two globulars are the densest known in the galactic globular cluster system ; the fact that bhb stars occur precisely there ( @xcite ) suggests that dynamical interactions are the cause .",

    "contamination by bhbs from a subordinate metal - poor population also does not seem probable .",
    "as noted , such contamination by a trace blue bhb component can not materially affect the indices of _",
    "high_-@xmath0  galaxies , but perturbations in _",
    "weak_-@xmath0galaxies should be considered .",
    "for example , 5% of the @xmath967-band light in metal - poor bhb stars would decrease the inferred age of a galaxy from 13 gyr to 8 gyr at solar metallicity .",
    "however , rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) , using a set of high - resolution spectral indices in the 4000   region , has shown in m  32 and eight strong - lined ellipticals that no more than @xmath968 of the light in the blue region ( and less than 2% in the @xmath967-band ) can come from very hot stars ( f0 and earlier ) .",
    "this falls short by a factor of two .",
    "moreover 5% of @xmath967-band light in bhb stars would imply that altogether @xmath11225% of the _ total _ light would have to come from metal - poor stars .",
    "this is twenty - five times more than the amount of metal - poor ( @xmath230}}}<-1.5 $ ] ) @xmath967-band light actually found in the outer part of m  32 by grillmair et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . that a much larger quantity of metal - poor stars could be found near the centers of _ more _ metal - rich elliptical galaxies seems implausible .",
    "we conclude that contamination by metal - poor populations is a negligible perturbation to the _ central _ ages of the g93 galaxies and could cause at most a @xmath11210% reduction near @xmath969 , if that .",
    "\\(3 ) _ contamination by blue straggler stars ( bsss ) . _",
    "a typical bss has @xmath970 mag , @xmath971 ( @xcite ) , and spectral type a8f0 . from worthey",
    "et al .  ( 1994 ) , dwarf a8f0 stars have @xmath972@xmath973  .",
    "to explain the high @xmath0  strength of m  32 ( @xmath974  ) as arising from a population of blue stragglers superimposed on an old ( 15 gyr ) , solar - metallicity population ( @xmath975  ) would require that @xmath976 of the @xmath967-band light come from bsss .",
    "this implies a bss specific frequency of @xmath977 per @xmath978 , which is a factor of 8 higher than seen in the most bss - rich galactic globular cluster ( palomar 5 ) and a factor of 28 higher than seen in the average galactic globular cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "we again conclude that _",
    "galaxies like m  32 are immune to perturbations by spurious hot components such as bss stars .",
    "consider next a trace contamination by bsss in low-@xmath0  galaxies .",
    "for example , to decrease the age of an elliptical from 13 gyr to 8 gyr at solar metallicity , bsss would again need to contribute @xmath979 of the @xmath967-band light . for ngc 3379",
    ", this implies a specific frequency of @xmath980 per @xmath978 . this specific frequency is a little more than a factor of 3 higher than that seen in the most bss - rich galactic globular cluster ( @xcite ) . in the absence of a complete theory of bss formation , a factor of three increase",
    "might not be impossible .",
    "on the other hand , as noted , rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) has shown that no more than @xmath981 of @xmath967-band light can come from hot stars f0 and earlier in m  32 and eight strong - lined ellipticals .",
    "this is less than half the light required and would perturb the age from 13 gyr to only 11 gyr , a reduction of only 15% .",
    "to summarize , the leading hot - star contaminants , bhbs and bsss , both peak at temperatures at or hotter than f0 , whereas the blue line - strength data of rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) imply that the great bulk of balmer absorption must be coming from cooler f and g stars , at or at most only slightly hotter than the derived turnoff temperatures . barring some as - yet - undiscovered contaminating population of cooler stars ,",
    "the rose limits imply that contamination of @xmath0  by non - main sequence stars can reduce the ages of even the oldest ellipticals by at most 1015% .",
    "the next three sections assess additional sources of systematic errors ; results are collected in table  [ tbl : syserr ] .",
    "this section discusses theoretical model uncertainties caused by errors in the stellar isochrones and line - strength response functions of tb95 .",
    "the major uncertainty in the interior models is the _ age scale _ , which is continually being refined .",
    "with the recent release of parallaxes from the hipparcos satellite , much effort has been spent recalibrating the ages of galactic globular clusters using both the new parallaxes and up - to - date models of stellar evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this effort has brought the ages of the oldest globular clusters down from @xmath98215 gyr to @xmath983 gyr , a reduction of @xmath984 .",
    "at least half of this reduction is due to corrections in the metallicity scale of globular clusters and to the use of more up - to - date stellar evolutionary models ( @xcite ) .",

    "the effect of the age recalibrations is not yet known but could be as much as @xmath985 , just by using isochrones from the most modern stellar evolutionary models .",
    "this agrees with charlot , worthey & bressan ( 1996 ) , who found that absolute ages are uncertain at the 25% level in stellar populations with ages @xmath986 gyr , resulting almost entirely from the choice of different stellar models . below and in appendix",

    "the effect of errors in the theoretical response functions of tb95 is illustrated in figure  [ fig : reserr ] , which is a schematic repeat of figure 1(b ) showing @xmath0  versus @xmath2 .",

    "where the solution lands is evidently governed by the _ relative lengths _ of the two correction vectors ; for model 4 , this ratio is @xmath990 = 1.25 .",

    "this section provides more details on the `` padova '' models discussed in section  [ sec : modeldep ] .",
    "the padova models are identical to the w94 models except that the isochrones ( and opacities ) are replaced by the isochrone library of bertelli et al .",
    "this isochrone library is based on the stellar evolutionary tracks developed by the padova group ( see bertelli et al .",
    "1994 and charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 for more details ) using the iglesias , rogers & wilson ( 1992 ) radiative opacities .",
    "these isochrones include all phases of stellar evolution from the zams to the remnant stage for stars of masses in the age range @xmath1019 gyr and metallicity range @xmath1020 ( @xmath1021 ) .",
    "the models include convective overshooting in stars more massive than @xmath1022 and an analytic prescription for the tp - agb regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : re8m_pad ] presents the inferred @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2line strengths for the w94 models using the padova isochrones . comparing this with figure  [ fig : re8 m ] shows small differences : the padova models have a higher metallicity at a given @xmath1  or @xmath2strength and a younger age at a given @xmath0  strength .",
    "figure  [ fig : padmodels ] ( bottom row ) shows the results of applying these new models to the g93 central ( @xmath9 ) line strengths .",

    "the fit for @xmath1006  is in accordance with the results of charlot , worthey & bressan ( 1996 ) : changing isochrones can alter the inferred ages from line strengths at young ages by as much as @xmath12 ; agreement at old ages is within 10% . on average ,",
    "the inferred metallicities @xmath5}$ ]  are increased by @xmath1024 in the padova models , as expected at fixed line strengths from the 3/2 rule ( @xmath1025}}}\\approx1.4 $ ] between the two sets of models ) .",
    "this section presents stellar population parameters derived by omitting the emission fill - in correction to @xmath0  discussed in section  [ sec : emission ] .",
    "this follows the suggestion by carrasco et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that no correction to @xmath0  should be made for residual @xmath0  emission based on [ ] , as they find no such correlation in their own sample of early - type galaxies .",

    "line diagrams for the g93 galaxies through the @xmath1018 aperture with the @xmath0correction omitted . as expected from the additive nature of the correction",
    ", galaxies now appear lower in the grid , and therefore older and more metal - poor than in figure  [ fig : re8 m ] .",
    "neglecting emission corrections forces some galaxies to have unreasonably old ages : for example , without corrections , ngc 1453 , ngc 2778 , ngc 4261 , ngc 4374 , ngc 5813 , ngc 5846 , ngc 7052 have ages @xmath1026 20 gyr . since all of these galaxies have clear @xmath0  emission ( see figs .  3.11 and 4.10 of g93 )",
    ", omitting the corrections makes no sense .",
    "furthermore , careful checking reveals that a few galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 4552 , ngc 4649 , ngc 5813 , ngc 5846 , ngc 7052 ) actually appear to have @xmath0  a little _ stronger _ than the standard ratio and are therefore probably undercorrected in our standard treatment .",
    "fixing them would move them up by a few hundredths in log @xmath0  and decrease their ages by @xmath102720% . since some of these are also objects that lie low in the grid , this correction would improve their positions .",
    "figure  [ fig : re8m_noem ] without @xmath0  corrections looks essentially like the original one  the large age spread and relative parameter rankings of the galaxies are essentially the same .",
    "this point is reinforced in the histograms of figure  [ fig : tza_hist_noem ] , which are nearly identical to those in figure  [ fig : tza_hist_re8 ] .",
    "we conclude that emission corrections are needed to derive the best age estimates for early - type galaxies , but that their exact magnitude does not affect our broad conclusions .",
    "this section derives a third set of population parameters using the lick / ids velocity dispersion corrections of twfbg98 for @xmath0  rather than the template - based corrections of g93 .",
    "as g93 does not provide raw @xmath0  strengths , we use his figure 4.1 to estimate his velocity corrections and use them to `` uncorrect '' the fully corrected line strengths back to raw strengths ( after removing the emission correction discussed in section  [ sec : emission ] ) . for most galaxies , g93 s velocity corrections are insignificant , but for high-@xmath960 galaxies they tend to be _",
    "negative_. after the g93 corrections are removed , we apply the _ positive _ corrections presented in twfbg98 ( their figure  3 ) and then reapply the emission corrections discussed in section  [ sec : emission ] .",
    "the newly corrected line strengths are plotted in figure  [ fig : re8m_isc ] , and the resulting stellar population parameter histograms are presented in figure  [ fig : tza_hist_isc ] .",
    "the new corrections move only a few high-@xmath960 galaxies , and therefore the _ relative _ age ranking of the sample is unaffected .",
    "the affected galaxies again tend to lie at the bottom of the grid and are again moved _ up _ by the new corrections ( by @xmath10270.04 in log @xmath0 ) so that galaxies that formerly lay below the grid at high ages now tend to lie on it .",
    "this correction , like the refined emission corrections of the previous section , thus improves the ages of the oldest objects .",
    "the g93 @xmath0  velocity corrections were based on a very high - s / n stellar template fit to each galaxy , whereas the twfbg98 corrections are based on a statistical average over stellar spectral types whose correction curves scattered widely . nevertheless , it is possible that the twfbg98 corrections are actually more acurate .",
    "the g93 stellar templates are a superb match to most of the spectrum _ except _ at @xmath0 , where emission corrupted the data .",
    "hence the template match ( and correction ) at @xmath0  in particular may be poor .",
    "the twfbg98 corrections were selected to match a large number of stars with about the same @xmath0  strength as typical galaxies and could therefore be better on average ."
