    "a significant effort is currently underway to complete the standard model calculation of the @xmath2 decay rate at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory .",
    "it is motivated by the fact that the relatively large branching ratio for this decay , combined with the increased precision in its measurement at the @xmath5 factories , make this an excellent way to probe for hints of new flavor physics .",
    "the experimental detection of @xmath2 events relies on the reconstruction of a high - energy photon , whose energy in the @xmath5-meson rest frame exceeds a value @xmath6gev .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the _ partial _ inclusive @xmath2 decay rate with a cut @xmath7 must deal with short - distance contributions associated with three different mass scales : the hard scale @xmath8 , an intermediate scale @xmath9 , and a soft scale @xmath10 , where @xmath11gev @xcite .",
    "the cut - dependent effects are described in terms of two perturbative objects called the jet function and the soft function , which for an analysis of the decay rate at nnlo are required with two - loop accuracy .",
    "the two - loop calculation of the soft function has been presented in @xcite , while that of the jet function is described in the present work . as a by - product of our analysis",
    "we calculate the two - loop anomalous - dimension kernel of the jet function .",
    "the jet function @xmath12 needed in the factorization formula for the partial @xmath2 decay rate @xcite is related to the original jet function @xmath0 of a massless quark in qcd @xcite by @xmath13 while the perturbative expression for @xmath0 involves singular distributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the function @xmath14 has a double - logarithmic expansion of the form @xmath15 by solving the renormalization - group equation for the jet function order by order in perturbation theory , the coefficients @xmath16 of the logarithmic terms in ( [ sexp ] ) can be obtained from the expansion coefficients of the jet - function anomalous dimension and the @xmath17-function , together with the coefficients @xmath18 arising in lower orders @xcite .",
    "the two - loop calculation performed in the present work gives the constant @xmath19 and provides the first direct calculation of the two - loop anomalous dimension of the jet function .",
    "we also note that from our result for @xmath12 one can derive the two - loop expression for @xmath0 in terms of so - called star distributions @xcite .",
    "we stress that even though our primary goal is to improve the theoretical analysis of @xmath2 decay , applications of our results are not confined to flavor physics . indeed , the jet function is a universal object , which enters in many applications of perturbative qcd to jet physics , deep - inelastic scattering , and other hard processes .",
    "the two - loop calculation of the function @xmath12 is described in section  [ sec:2loop ] .",
    "it follows closely our calculation of the soft function in @xcite ; however , the evaluation of the two - loop master integrals is considerably more complicated in the present case . in section  [ sec : dis ]",
    "we briefly discuss jet - function moments and their renormalization - group evolution .",
    "the factorization properties of decay rates and cross sections for processes involving hard , soft , and collinear degrees of freedom become most transparent if an effective field theory is employed to disentangle the contributions associated with these different momentum regions .",
    "soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) has been designed to accomplish this task @xcite . in the context of scet",
    "the jet function is defined in terms of the hard - collinear quark propagator @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two light - like vectors satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "for simplicity we suppress color indices on the quark fields .",
    "the propagator is proportional to a unit matrix in color space .",
    "the composite field @xmath25 @xcite is the gauge - invariant ( under both soft and hard - collinear gauge transformations ) effective - theory field for a massless quark after a decoupling transformation has been applied , which removes the interactions of soft gluons with hard - collinear fields in the leading - order scet lagrangian @xcite . in the absence of such interactions",
    "the hard - collinear lagrangian is equivalent to the conventional qcd lagrangian , and we can rewrite the propagator in terms of standard qcd fields as @xmath26 the quark fields are multiplied by wilson lines @xmath27 which render the expression ( [ eq : jqcd ] ) gauge invariant . note that the wilson lines are absent in the light - cone gauge @xmath28 .",
    "for this reason the function @xmath29 is sometimes referred to as the quark propagator in axial gauge .",
    "lorentz invariance dictates that the qcd propagator in the presence of these wilson lines contains two dirac structures proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the dirac matrices appearing to the left and right of the field operators in ( [ eq : jqcd ] ) project out the terms proportional to @xmath30 .",

    "the relevant two - loop diagrams are shown in figure  [ fig : jetgraphs ] .",
    "equally well , one could use the scet lagrangian together with ( [ eq : jscet ] ) to perform the calculation . in this case",

    "the basic strategy is to first introduce feynman parameters to perform the loop integration and then introduce mellin - barnes parameters to carry out the feynman parameter integrations .",
    "what makes this method powerful is that ( after analytic continuation to @xmath49 ) the mellin - barnes integrands can be taylor expanded about @xmath50 . to start ,",
    "note that after performing the loop integral over @xmath51 using conventional feynman parameters the result for @xmath48 can be written as @xmath52 we now introduce two mellin - barnes parameters via @xmath53 to break apart the last denominator in ( [ eq : kint ] ) into a product with factors @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "( we do not introduce a mellin - barnes parameter for the denominator @xmath57 , as this would lead to ambiguities in the treatment of poles in the resulting light - cone propagators . )",

    "careful inspection reveals that the representation ( [ eq : mbrep ] ) is valid if the real parts of all @xmath59-functions are positive , i.e. , if the poles of each @xmath59-function are either all to the left or all to the right of the integration contours . with the choice @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , this condition is fulfilled if @xmath64 . starting in the allowed range and increasing @xmath47",

    "the arguments of all other @xmath59-functions remain positive up to @xmath69 . to obtain a representation that is valid around @xmath50 , one has to either deform the contours such that the crossings are avoided , or separately take into account the contributions of the poles that end up on the wrong side of the contours as @xmath70 , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the residues of these poles have again the form of mellin - barnes integrals , however with one integration less than the original expression ( [ eq : mbrep ] ) .",
    "one analyzes these contributions with the same method as the original integral and continues until one ends up with a representation which is valid around @xmath50 .",
    "once this is achieved , the integrands are expanded in @xmath47 , the integration contours are closed , and the integrations are rewritten as sums over the residues of the poles . in fact , since the original integral includes a factor @xmath71 , only contributions which arise from poles that cross a contour need to be included in the limit @xmath70 . very recently , the continuation in @xmath47 with subsequent numerical evaluation of the integrals has been automatized @xcite .",

    "we use the method of sector decomposition @xcite , which allows one to systematically disentangle overlapping singularities in feynman integrals .",
    "this procedure splits the integral into a large number of terms in which all singularities are factorized . because it leads to large algebraic expressions ,",
    "the sector decomposition is performed using computer algebra .",
    "after numerical integration of the resulting expressions we reproduce the analytical result for the integral @xmath48 with a numerical precision of better than 1 part in @xmath72 .    with the integrals at hand , the evaluation of the two - loop diagrams in figure  [ fig : jetgraphs ] is straightforward .",

    "a stringent check of the remaining diagrams with gluon emissions from the wilson lines is that their divergences must cancel against the jet - function renormalization factor , which we will now derive .",
    "the renormalization of the bare jet function proceeds in complete analogy to that of the bare soft function discussed in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for a more detailed discussion .",
