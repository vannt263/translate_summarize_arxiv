    "[ circles ] .",
    "one can inscribe into each of the curvilinear triangles in this picture a unique circle ( the uniqueness follows from an old theorem of apollonius of perga circa 200 bc ) .",
    "if one continues inscribing the circles in this way the resulting picture is called an apollonian circle packing ( acp ) .",
    "a key aspect of studying such packings is to consider the radii of the circles which come up in a given acp . however , since these radii become small very quickly , it is more convenient to study the _ curvatures _ of the circles , or the reciprocals of the radii",
    ". studied in this way , acp s possess a beautiful number theoretic property that all of the circles in an acp have integer curvature if the initial four have integer curvature .",
    "the number theory associated with these integral acp s has been investigated extensively in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a central theorem to any of the results in these papers is descartes theorem , which says that the curvatures @xmath1 of any four mutually tangent circles satisfy what is called the descartes equation , @xmath2 where a circle which is internally tangent to the other three is defined to have negative curvature ( see @xcite for a proof ) .",
    "given this formula we may assign to every set of @xmath3 mutually tangent circles in an integral packing @xmath4 a vector @xmath5 of the circles curvatures .",
    "we use descartes equation to express any integral acp as an orbit of a subgroup of the orthogonal group @xmath6 acting on @xmath7 .",
    "this subgroup , called the apollonian group , is specified in @xcite , and we denote it by @xmath8 .",
    "it is a group on the four generators @xmath9 @xmath10 derived by fixing three of the coordinates of @xmath7 and solving @xmath11 for the fourth .",
    "note that each @xmath12 is of order @xmath13 and determinant @xmath14 .",
    "also , @xmath12 fixes all but the @xmath15th coordinate of @xmath5 , producing a new curvature in the @xmath15th coordinate .    in their paper @xcite the five authors graham , lagarias , mallows , wilks , and yan",
    "ask several fundamental questions about the curvatures in a given integer acp , which have mostly been resolved in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in particular , they make some observations about the congruence classes of curvatures which occur in any given acp , and suggest a  strong density \" conjecture , that every sufficiently large integer satisfying these congruence conditions should appear as a curvature in the packing . in @xcite ,",
    "the first author and bourgain prove a weaker conjecture of graham et.al . of this flavor that the integers appearing as curvatures in a given acp make up a positive fraction of @xmath16 .",
    "proving the  strong density \" conjecture would be significantly more difficult . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xmath17-adic description of the apollonian orbit from @xcite to formulate this conjecture precisely and provide strong experimental evidence in section  [ locglobal ] in support of it .",
    "our conjecture is specified further in the case of two different acp s in section  [ locglobal ] .",
    "it is stated generally here .",
    "* local to global principle for acp s : * [ lg ] let @xmath4 be an integral acp and let @xmath18 be the set of residue classes mod @xmath19 of curvatures in @xmath4 .",
    "then there exists @xmath20 such that any integer @xmath21 whose residue mod @xmath19 lies in @xmath18 is in fact a curvature of a circle in @xmath4 .",
    "we note that @xmath22 above depends on the packing @xmath4 under consideration . in this paper , we investigate two acp s which we call the _ bugeye _ packing @xmath23 and the _ coins _ packing @xmath24 .",
    "these packings are represented by right action of the apollonian group on @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ( see fig .  [ bugcoin ] for a picture ) . in the case of @xmath23 , our data suggests that @xmath27 exists and is @xmath28 , as we find no integers @xmath29 which violate the above conjecture .",
    "the data for @xmath24 , however , suggests that @xmath30 exists , but that it is @xmath31 .",
    "namely , there are integers @xmath32 in certain residue classes in the set @xmath33 which do _ not _ appear as curvatures in the packing we consider .",
    "we explain this further in section  [ locglobal ] .    another interesting problem regarding acp s is counting circles of prime curvature in a given packing .",
    "sarnak proves in @xcite that there are infinitely many circles of prime curvature in any packing . in light of this",
    ", we give a heuristic in section  [ primeacp ] for the weighted prime count @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a circle in the packing @xmath4 and @xmath37 is its curvature .",
    "this count is closely related to the number @xmath38 of prime curvatures less than @xmath0 in a packing @xmath4 ( see remark  [ katsremark ] ) .",
    "we confirm experimentally that our heuristic holds for the packings @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we note that our heuristic does not depend on the chosen packing @xmath4  in fact , it yields the correct count of prime curvatures for all of the packings we checked . we summarize it in the following conjecture :    [ pconj ]",
    "let @xmath39 be the number of circles in a packing @xmath4 of curvature less than @xmath0 , and let @xmath34 be as in ( [ intropsi ] ) .",
    "then as @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the value of the dirichlet @xmath43-series at @xmath13 with character @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "sarnak also shows in @xcite that there are infinitely many pairs of tangent circles of prime curvature ( we call these _ kissing primes _ ) .",
    "we address the question of counting kissing primes in @xmath4 via the weighted sum @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the set of unordered pairs of tangent circles @xmath51 of prime curvature in a packing @xmath4 , and @xmath37 and @xmath52 denote their respective curvatures . in this case , it is less obvious what the relation is between @xmath48 and the number @xmath53 of kissing prime circles in a packing @xmath4 both of whose curvatures are less than @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore stick with @xmath48 in our computation :    [ tpconj ] let @xmath48 be as in ( [ introsum2 ] ) , and let @xmath39 be the number of circles in a packing @xmath4 of curvature less than @xmath0 .",

    "our computations suggest that this conjecture is true and we predict the value @xmath296 in the examples we check .",

    "recall from theorem  [ padicorbit ] that for any orbit @xmath58 of the apollonian group , @xmath300 so the graph @xmath297 is completely determined by the structure of @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",

    "[ gammalemma ] let @xmath39 be as before , let @xmath36 be a circle in an integral appolonian packing p , and let @xmath37 be the curvature of @xmath36 .",

    "graham et.al .",
    "observe this in @xcite where they compute which integers less than @xmath331 are  exceptions \" for @xmath23 they find integers which satisfy these local conditions for @xmath23 modulo @xmath330 but do not occur as curvatures in the packing .",
    "our data extends their findings ( we consider integers up to @xmath332 ) , and shows that all integers between @xmath331 and @xmath333 belonging to one of the congruence classes in part ( ii ) of observation  [ bugob ] appear as curvatures in the packing @xmath23 .",
    "the following histograms illustrate the distribution of the frequencies with which each integer in the given range satisfying the specified congruence condition occurs as a curvature in the packing @xmath23 .",
    "the frequencies seem normally distributed , and the means of the distributions can be computed , as we do in ( [ meaneq ] ) .",
    "the variance , however , is much more difficult to predict at this time  explaining the behavior of the variance as we consider larger integers would shed more light on our local to global conjecture . note that there are no exceptions to the local to global principle in this range whenever @xmath118 is not a frequency represented in the histogram ( i.e. each integer occurs at least once ) .",
    "there are several other frequencies not represented in the histograms for both @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( these show up as gaps in the graphs ) , and an explanation of this aspect would be interesting .",
    "we do the same analysis for the packing @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", we must consider much larger integers than in the case of @xmath23 in order to get comparable results .",
    "this can be explained partially by the fact that the constant @xmath334 in kontorovich - oh s formula @xmath335 is much smaller for the packing @xmath24 than the packing @xmath23 since the initial four circles in @xmath24 are much larger than the initial four in @xmath23 ( see part ( i ) of lemmata  [ bugob ] and [ coinob ] ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath336 and @xmath323 .",
    "however , our data suggests that the proposed local to global principle should hold for this packing as well .",
    "[ coinob ] let @xmath337 denote the possible congruence classes mod @xmath19 in the packing @xmath24 , and let @xmath338 be as in theorem  [ oh ] .",
    "then we have    * @xmath339 , where @xmath336 * @xmath340 * @xmath341 * for @xmath342 , let @xmath327 denote @xmath0 mod @xmath19 . if @xmath343 or @xmath344 , then @xmath0 is a curvature in the packing @xmath24 .    again , note",
    "that part ( iv ) is an observation based solely on our computations , while the first three parts in lemma  [ coinob ] rely on lemma  [ gammalemma ] and theorem  [ oh ] .",
    "the histograms below illustrate the distribution of the frequencies with which each integer in the given range satisfying the specified congruence condition occurs as a curvature in the packing @xmath24 .",
    "note that , as with @xmath23 , the frequencies with which integers are represented in the packing seem to have a normal distribution .",
    "however , since the mean of this distribution is much smaller for @xmath24 than for @xmath23 , we find that @xmath118 is often a frequency represented in the histograms , and so there are still some exceptions to the proposed local to global principle in the range we consider .",
    "as we mentioned before , the mean in each of these histograms is easily computable : let @xmath36 denote a circle in an apollonian packing @xmath4 and let @xmath37 denote the curvature of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath345 $ ] be an interval of length @xmath346 and let @xmath347 be an integer .",
    "let @xmath348 be the number of times @xmath0 is a curvature of a circle in @xmath4",
    ". for and integer @xmath349 , let @xmath350 then by lemma  [ gammalemma ] , @xmath351 the equivalence of the two sums above is easy to observe  one counts the same set of curvatures , but partitions them differently .",
    "in particular , the expression in ( [ equivalentsums ] ) allows us to determine the mean of the distributions in the histograms above .",
    "namely , denote by @xmath347 an integer in some interval @xmath345 $ ] of length @xmath346 .",
    "let @xmath352 , and let @xmath353 denote the mean of the number of times @xmath354 mod @xmath19 is represented as a curvature in the packing @xmath4 .",
    "note that there are precisely @xmath355 integers congruent to @xmath311 mod @xmath19 in the interval @xmath356 . combined with ( [ equivalentsums ] ) , this gives us @xmath357 this formula predicts the following values for the means in @xmath23 in the range @xmath358 ; and @xmath24 in the range @xmath359 : @xmath360 which coincides with the means observed in the histograms .",
    "this clarifies why the mean is small for packings where the constant @xmath334 in the formula @xmath361 is small , and why one needs to consider very large integers to see that the local to global principle for such packings should hold .",
    "this analysis can be carried out for any acp , and will likely yield similar results . in the direction of proving conjecture  [ lg ]",
    ", one might investigate how @xmath296 depends on the given packing ",
    "can it perhaps be expressed in terms of the constant @xmath334 in ( [ c ] ) ?",
    "one might also ask how the variance of the distributions above depend on the packing , and how it changes with the size of the integers we consider  answering this would give further insight into the local to global correspondence for curvatures in integer acp s .",
    "we represent an acp by a tree of quadruples . fig .",
    "[ tree ] shows the first two generations of the tree corresponding to @xmath24 . to generate all curvatures of magnitude less than @xmath0",
    ", we use a lifo ( last - in - first - out ) stack to generate and prune this tree .",
    "the algorithm is as follows :    * push the root quadruple onto the stack . * until the stack is empty , perform an iterative process : * * pop a quadruple off of the stack and generate its children . * * for each child , if the new curvature created ( i.e. the maximum entry of the quadruple ) is less than @xmath0 , then push the child onto the stack .    by pushing a quadruple onto the stack",
    "only if its maximum entry is less than @xmath0 , we effectively prune the the tree .",
    "since we know each quadruple has a larger maximum entry than its parent , we use step 2__b ) _ _ to avoid generating branches whose quadruples are known to have entries greater than @xmath0 .",
    "although we use the concept of a tree to _ generate _ curvatures , we note that the entire tree structure is not necessary to _ store _ such curvatures .",
    "instead , we store the curvatures in a one - dimensional array of @xmath0 elements , all initialized to zero . the @xmath15th element of the array contains the number of curvatures with magnitude @xmath15 . for instance , the @xmath19th element of the array for @xmath24 is equal to @xmath362 , while the @xmath363th element is equal to @xmath118 , since there are no curvatures equal to 25 in @xmath24 .",
    "we use these arrays to generate the histograms in section  [ locglobal ] . due to matlab s memory constraints",
    ", we limit our matlab arrays to @xmath364 entries .",
