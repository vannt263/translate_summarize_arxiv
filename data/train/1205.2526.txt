    "remote observations of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) by heliospheric imagers ( his ) , combined with _ in situ _ measurements provide a unique opportunity to study the evolution , propagation and properties of these transients .",
    "it also constitutes a main science objective of the _ solar - terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo ) mission .",
    "white - light observations by the his onboard the stereo and by the _ solar mass ejection imager _ ( smei ) onboard _ coriolis _ can be analyzed to determine the direction of propagation of cmes and their kinematics ( e.g. with the methods of , , , , , ) .",
    "these methods can be used in real - time with beacon data from stereo to predict whether or not a cme will hit a spacecraft , and , if a hit is forecasted , to predict the arrival time and speed at 1  au @xcite . _ in situ _ measurements can then be used to test , compare and validate these predictions .",
    "another approach is to constrain remote - sensing observations with the knowledge obtained from _ in situ _ measurements ( final speed , arrival time ) .",
    "this is the approach taken , for example , in , , and to study cme kinematics .",
    "such coordinated studies have been primarily undertaken for earth - directed cmes , which impacted ace or _",
    "@xcite but also for cmes or corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) which impacted _ venus express _",
    "@xcite , messenger or spacecraft orbiting the planet mars @xcite .",
    "most of the analyses of data from planetary missions have been for cmes which also impacted earth .",
    "there have also been a few studies of cmes which impacted one of the stereo spacecraft @xcite . as the separation between the two stereo spacecraft increases , stereoscopic views of a cme into the hi field - of - view",
    "are expected to become rarer .",
    "therefore , stereoscopic methods @xcite making use of the two stereo views may not be applicable for earth - directed cmes from mid-2011 onwards , when the total separation is larger than 180@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , it is likely that future missions ( e.g. , see ) will only have one spacecraft with a hi instrument .",
    "it is therefore important to further test and validate methods using hi observations from a single spacecraft .",
    "the two main fitting methods , the fixed-@xmath0 ( f@xmath0 ; ) , and harmonic mean ( hm ; ) , have been compared for three earth - directed cmes in and for cmes observed simultaneously by both stereo spacecraft in 2008 and 2009 @xcite .",
    "it was found that the two methods differ for small ( @xmath2 ) and large ( @xmath3 ) viewing angles @xcite .",
    "the largest viewing angle for which these two techniques have been compared for a earth - impacting cme is about 67@xmath1 for the april 2010 cme .",
    "this spacecraft separation is within the range where the techniques are expected to give similar results .",
    "studying stereo - directed events has the advantage of allowing for larger viewing angles compared to earth - directed cmes and to prepare for future observations of earth - directed cmes in future years . here",
    ", we analyze the remote - sensing observations of stereo - impacting cmes during the years 20082010 .",
    "we determine the cme direction of propagation and speed by fitting the remote - sensing observations with the two fitting techniques ( f@xmath0 and hm ) .",
    "the predicted hit / miss , arrival time and speed are then compared with _ in situ _ measurements . in this way , we are able : i ) to assess which of the two methods is able to better determine some of the cme properties measured _ in situ _ and , ii ) to determine how the accuracy of the methods is affected by the increasing separation of the stereo spacecraft from the sun - earth line .",
    "we use stereo - directed events from 2009 to 2010 to prepare for the large separation between the earth and the stereo spacecraft which will reach 125@xmath1 by january 2013 .",
    "this allows us to establish what might be the largest viewing angle for which a cme can be observed into hi-2 .    in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we summarize briefly the two fitting techniques used in this article and explain our data selection process . in section",
    "[ sec : dec2009 ] , we present the detailed analysis of one event , which occurred on 4 december 2009 , when the separation between the two stereo spacecraft was 130@xmath1 . in section [ sec : stat ] , we present the results from the analysis of 20 events which occurred between the beginning of 2008 and mid-2010 .",
    "the conclusions of our investigation are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the field - of - view of a heliospheric imager , the position of a density feature ( e.g. , a stream interaction region sir or a cme ) is measured as the angle between the observing spacecraft , the sun and the density structure , and it is commonly referred to as the elongation angle .",
    "when cmes are observed to large elongation angles , the time - elongation data can be fitted to analytical functions and a single value for the cme speed and direction of propagation can be derived @xcite .",
    "two common methods are the f@xmath0 @xcite and the hm fittings @xcite .",
    "we will focus here on these two methods only",
    ". a schematic view of the two methods is shown in the bottom panel of figure  1 . here",
    ", we use the following notation : @xmath4 is the elongation angle , @xmath0 the direction of propagation , which is assumed to be fixed , @xmath5 the heliocentric position of the observing spacecraft ( stereo ) and @xmath6 the time .    assuming a constant propagation speed , @xmath7 , and a single plasma element , the relation between elongation and distance of can be inverted to obtain the f@xmath0 fitting relation @xcite :    @xmath8    a measured time - elongation profile can be fitted to a profile of calculated elongations given by equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "the f@xmath0 approximation assumes that the cme is a single point and therefore , it is not straightforward to determine when the fitting results implies a hit or a miss and what is the expected arrival time and speed of different parts of the cme .",
    "previous works @xcite made the assumption that the f@xmath0 fitting predicts a hit if the best - fitted direction is within @xmath9@xmath10 of a spacecraft and that the arrival time and speed are the same for all parts of the `` front '' . here",
    ", we use a looser criterion of @xmath11 around the best - fit direction and we also assume that all parts of the cme `` front '' arrive at the same time with the same speed .",
    "this criterion of @xmath11 is used to include the uncertainty in the best - fit direction of propagation , which is typically 1015@xmath1 and the fact that even narrow density features are expected to have a half - width of about 10@xmath1 . assuming a half - width wider than 20@xmath1 is not consistent with the underlying assumption of the f@xmath0 approximation : the fact that the observed signal originates from the apex of the cme .",
    "this can be seen in the bottom panel of figure  1 for a large viewing angle : if the cme is assumed to be wide , the wings of the cme are at a larger elongation angle than the apex of the cme ( see also discussion in ) .",
    "another simple assumption for what is observed by his , as proposed by and , is as follows .",
    "the cme front can be modeled as a locally circular front with a diameter equal to the distance of the apex ( or equivalently , a front which is anchored at the sun ) .",
    "it is further assumed that the measured elongation angle simply corresponds to the angle between the sun - spacecraft line and _ the line - of - sight tangent to this circular front_. assuming a constant propagation speed and the geometry explained above , the hm fitting relation can be obtained @xcite :    @xmath12    a measured time - elongation profile can also be fitted to profiles of calculated elongations given by equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "the fitted speed , @xmath13 , and direction , @xmath14 , correspond to that of the nose ( apex ) of the cme . to determine the predicted speed and arrival time at a spacecraft which is not hit directly by the nose of the cme ,",
    "a correction is needed as derived in . for a spacecraft at a heliocentric distance @xmath15 and",
    "separated by an angle @xmath16 with the observing spacecraft , the predicted speed is @xmath17 and the predicted time is @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noted that both fitting methods assume a constant propagation speed and a constant direction .",
    "using stereoscopic methods @xcite , it is possible to relax these two assumptions and derive for all pairs of observations the cme direction and position ( and speed ) .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the two stereo spacecraft can observe a cme into hi-2 field - of - view when the separation between the spacecraft is 180@xmath1 or beyond . the technique of can be used to derive the cme position without assuming a constant propagation speed , although it is not straightforward to decouple the effects of the varying speed from the change in the cme shape . due to their simplicity ,",
    "fitting techniques are used for real - time space weather forecasting @xcite and for scientific analyses by a number of groups @xcite and we focus here on these techniques .",
    "following other researchers ( e.g. , see ) , we start from icmes measured _ in situ _ at 1  au by one of the two stereo spacecraft and attempt to identify , first , their heliospheric sources as measured in the hi instruments and , second , their coronal sources .",
    "our starting point is the list of icmes observed by impact @xcite and plastic @xcite onboard stereo as maintained at www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~jlan/stereo/level3 .",
    "the determination of the icmes and their characteristics can be found in .",
    "we focus on icmes detected from january 2008 to july 2010 : 21 by stereo - a and 26 by stereo - b . for this list of 47 icmes ,",
    "we attempt to find their heliospheric counterparts in remote - sensing images .",
    "we use the list summarized on the rutherford appleton laboratory ( ral ) website link : www.stereo.rl.ac.uk / hieventlist.html [ www.stereo.rl.ac.uk/hieventlist.html ] of heliospheric transients observed by the his @xcite part of secchi @xcite onboard stereo .",
    "this list consists of the time - elongation tracks measured on j - maps @xcite along elevation 0@xmath1 for various transients .",
    "some of the time - elongation measurements from this list have been used in previous studies @xcite . on the ral website ,",
    "the time - elongation datapoints for each track are plotted ; in the present study , we use the corresponding time - elongation measurements .",
    "j - maps are constructed using running differences of secchi images ; intensity enhancements with respect to the previous image appear as bright regions while depletions appear as black regions @xcite . as noted in , the clearest feature to track",
    "is the `` black '' front , i.e. the transition between the bright regions and the dark regions ( maximum contrast ) .",
    "this `` black '' front is typically 46 hours behind the start of the cme and , therefore , our tracking introduces a systematic offset in the predicted arrival time of an event .",
    "a j - map and an example of the tracking of a `` black '' front ( with red circles ) are shown in the top panel of figure  1 . in , we compared the direction of propagation and distance derived by stereoscopic methods for the 2008 april 26 cme ( cme # 2 in the present study ) using the bright front and the `` black '' front of the cme .",
    "we found that in the hi fields - of - view the kinematics and direction of the cme using the two tracks are nearly identical . as a summary , in order to follow the cmes to large elongation angles , we use the tracks of the `` black '' front of the cmes ; this introduces a systematic offset in the predicted arrival time but it is not expected to change the predicted arrival speed and cme direction . since no study has yet focused on determining the exact value for this offset , we do not correct the predicted arrival times for it .    for each icme from the impact list , we have looked in the ral list for transients whose starting time is within a window of 36 to 120 hours prior to the arrival time of the icme .",
    "we use hi-1 movies to identify the cmes and to associate them with one ( or multiple ) of the tracks from the ral list . in most cases",
    ", there is only one cme for which the expected arrival time is within @xmath19  hours of the actual arrival time and whose time - elongation profile shows the required trend ( deceleration for large viewing angles , acceleration for small ones ) .",
    "however , there are often multiple tracks associated with each cme , corresponding , for example , to the two dense fronts which bracket the cmes ( see , e.g. , ) and sometimes to core material . in these cases ,",
    "we have chosen the track corresponding to the leading edge of the cme . sometimes , there are no associated tracks , either because no cme was visible in the field - of - view of the his or because there is no track in the ral list associated with a given cme ( often because the cme is faint and not visible to large elongation angles , sometimes because of data gaps ) .",
    "overall , we find 20 icmes ( @xmath20 ) for which there is a corresponding track in the ral list .",
    "using information from the hi movies , we identify the cmes in cor-2 and cor-1 , when possible .",
    "the 20 cmes as well as their first appearance in cor-1 or cor-2 are summarized in table  1 .",
    "some of the cmes are streamer blowouts , which typically form at heights of 23  r@xmath21 , start at low speed and may not be associated with any clear signature in the low corona ( e.g. , see ) .",
    "for these cmes , we do not indicate a starting time but only a starting day in table  1 .",
    "the information from cor-1 and cor-2 is not directly used in this study , but it is listed for completeness and , for future references , if our list is to be used in future studies . in table   1 , cmes are ordered by the total separation between the two stereo spacecraft . since each cme was observed remotely by one stereo spacecraft and measured _ in situ _ by the other , the total separation gives an estimate of the viewing angle at which stereo remotely observed the cme .",
    "the proportion of icmes for which we find remote - sensing observations into the outer heliosphere allowing a successful prediction decreases with increasing separation between the stereo spacecraft , from 10/14 in 2008 to 9/21 in 2009 and only 1/12 in 2010 .",
    "however , there are 5 cmes which were tracked into hi-2 field - of - view with a spacecraft separation of more than 120@xmath1 .    .",
    "the columns show the cme number in this study , the icme number ( with year ) from the impact list , the track number from the ral list , the date of first detection in cor-1 or cor-2 and the separation between stereo - a and stereo - b from left to right .",
    "( f ) indicates a filament eruption . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +        nine out of the ten events in 2008 are successfully predicted by both methods ( the exception is cme 5 ) but the same is true for only three out of the ten events in 20092010 ( first 3 events ) . for nine out of these 12 events ,",
    "the arrival time predicted from the two fitting methods is nearly identical ( see square symbols in the bottom panels of figure  5 ) .",
    "the exceptions are events 10 , 11 and 13 ( all for separation greater than 85@xmath1 ) .",
    "this finding is also confirmed by earth - directed events , for which both methods have essentially given the same predictions up until the beginning of 2011 .",
    "the arrival time of events 11 and 13 is significantly better reproduced with the hm fitting method than with the f@xmath0 method .",
    "this comes from the fact that the hm best - fit velocity is usually higher than the best - fit velocity from the f@xmath0 method ( see also ) .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that for viewing angles greater than 80@xmath1 , the hm fitting method is expected to give better results than the f@xmath0 method @xcite .",
    "event 10 is different because both methods predict a cme direction more than 25@xmath1 away from the spacecraft ( towards earth ) , i.e. both methods predict a miss",
    ". however , this event was both observed _ in situ _ by ace and stereo - b , so we consider that the best - fit angle gives an accurate prediction .    as noted before ,",
    "the back of the white front in the j - map ( `` black front '' ) is being tracked .",
    "we consider that this front is 46 hours behind the cme front as seen in j - maps .",
    "therefore , there is a bias of the two methods towards finding later arrival times .",
    "in fact , if we look at the average ( signed ) arrival time error , it is + 6 hours for the hm and + 10.6 hours for f@xmath0 fitting methods .",
    "only five events are predicted early by one or both methods .",
    "we believe part of this average error in the arrival time is directly attributable to the fact that we tracked the `` black front '' in the j - map .      for cmes 5 , 14 , 15 and 16 , the best - fit cme direction from the f@xmath0 fit is within 20@xmath1 of the stereo spacecraft but the best - fit direction from the hm",
    "is more than 20@xmath1 away .",
    "cme 5 is a very faint event for which the best - fit angle from both methods indicate an expected hit at l1 , which was not recorded .",
    "it is likely that the assumption of wide cme used in the hm fitting method does not apply for this cme .",
    "cme 14 is a relatively fast event ( 460 km  s@xmath22 at 1 au from the _ in situ _",
    "measurements ) observed at a viewing angle of about 100@xmath1 . for cmes faster than the solar wind , the assumption of constant propagation speed used in the fitting methods results in an additional error : the physical deceleration due to the interaction with the solar wind @xcite is fitted as a geometrical deceleration associated with a large viewing angle .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced for the hm fitting method @xcite because it has , intrinsically , larger errors than the f@xmath0 fitting method .    for cmes 15 and 16",
    ", the hm fits give a better match for the arrival time than the f@xmath0 fits .",
    "event 15 corresponds to a small track due to a data gap starting at around 22:00 ut on 28 september ( when the cme is around 15@xmath1 elongation ) .",
    "previous works have shown that density transients must be imaged to much larger elongations to be fitted with accuracy @xcite . the filament eruption originated from the eastern side of the solar disk as seen from stereo - b , corresponding to an angle of propagation likely to be greater than 130@xmath1 .",
    "event 16 is another filament eruption from behind the eastern limb as seen in stereo - a , but it is unclear from stereo - b images where it originated from . in both events ,",
    "the hm method is better mostly due to the correction in the arrival time of .",
    "however , the best - fit angles obtained by the hm fitting method are unrealistically large ( @xmath23 viewing angle ) .",
    "the fact that hm fitting method yields a better arrival time estimate than the f@xmath0 fitting method is probably just coincidental .      for the last four events of our list ( 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 ) , a hit was only predicted with the hm fit . for the last three events ( 18 , 19 , 20 )",
    ", the arrival time is best predicted with the hm fitting method as well , whereas for event 17 , the error is smaller using the f@xmath0 fit .",
    "however , for event 17 , the cme direction of propagation predicted by the f@xmath0 fitting is more than 30@xmath1 away from the spacecraft , which makes it unlikely that the f@xmath0 fitting predicts a hit .",
    "the filament eruption for event 17 is seen almost as disk - centered from stereo - a , which corresponds to the direction predicted by the hm fit .",
    "the larger error originates from the larger speed as compared with the f@xmath0 fit .",
    "in this article , we have examined stereo - impacting cmes , combined _ in situ _ measurements with remote observations by stereo / secchi and compared the prediction for hit / miss , arrival time and speed for the two most commonly used fitting methods .",
    "we have started from a list of 47 icmes observed using plastic and impact from january 2008 to june 2010 , during which time the separation between the two stereo spacecraft increased from 45@xmath1 to 140@xmath1 .",
    "we have been able to identify the remote - sensing observations for 20 icmes ( @xmath24 ) . for some icmes for which we were unable to identify a counterpart in the remote - sensing observation , this was due to data gaps or poor observations leading to short tracks .",
    "it is also likely that some of the icmes identified at 1  au were small flux ropes embedded in the solar wind or in stream interaction regions ( sirs ) .",
    "this type of icmes is unlikely to be observed behind the limb .",
    "the proportion of icmes for which we find remote - sensing observations decreases with increasing viewing angle from 10/14 in 2008 ( separation less than 90@xmath1 ) to only 1/12 in 2010 ( separation greater than 130@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , we find six cmes viewed more than 20@xmath1 behind the limb , which can be tracked into hi-2 field - of - view .",
    "five of these six cmes were filament eruptions , hence , associated with wide cmes .",
    "therefore , we predict that some earth - directed cmes will be successfully tracked by secchi until early 2013 , when the stereo  earth separation will be comparable to the stereo - a  stereo - b separation in early 2010 . it should be noted that the first cme observed by secchi propagated 2030@xmath1 behind the limb @xcite and was imaged to 40@xmath1 elongation angle .",
    "if the measured signal in the hi instruments come from the part of the cme closest to the thomson sphere , only very wide cmes might be observed up to these large viewing angles ( similar to the original argument of ) .",
    "if the thomson scattering effects are relatively negligible due to the extended and non - uniform density structure of the cme front , then the detected signal is likely to originate from the tangent to the cme front as proposed by and . in this case ,",
    "less wide ( @xmath25 ) earth - directed cmes might be observed in 2012 .",
    "we have compared the fitting method based on the fixed-@xmath0 approximation @xcite , where the cme apex is assumed to be observed at all times , with that based on the harmonic mean approximation @xcite , where the tangent to a circular cme front is assumed to be observed .",
    "we confirm that both methods give nearly identical results for the propagation angle of cmes viewed less than 80@xmath1 away from the observing spacecraft .",
    "we have also found that this holds true for the predicted arrival time and final speed of cmes .",
    "we show evidence , based on 20 icmes , that these methods provide direction and speed consistent with _ in situ _ measurements . for viewing angles larger than @xmath26 , we find significant differences between both methods .",
    "we find some anecdotal evidence that the hm fitting method might be better adapted to very large viewing angles as compared to the f@xmath0 fitting method : the arrival time predicted using the hm fit is better ( 4/8 ) or identical ( 2/8 ) than the arrival time predicted from the f@xmath0 fit in six out of eight cmes observed behind the limb .",
    "however , for some fast cmes , the hm fitting method gives unrealistic results for the cme speed and direction , for the following reason .",
    "the constant velocity assumption of these methods causes cme deceleration ( acceleration ) to be interpreted as geometrical deceleration ( acceleration ) , resulting in errors in the best - fit direction of propagation .",
    "this effect has been found to be more pronounced for the hm fitting method as compared to the f@xmath0 method @xcite .",
    "these results should be confirmed in further studies using earth - directed cmes as well as cmes which impacted planetary missions such as those dedicated to mercury , venus and mars .",
    "in addition , further studies should look into more details at the _ in situ _ characteristics ( speed , duration , strength , orientation , etc ... ) of icmes which were identified in remote - sensing observations as compared to those for which we could not find a corresponding track in j - maps .",
