    "pusey , barrett and rudolph ( pbr ) @xcite have proven a new theorem which imposes a significant constraint on the interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the theorem shows that if one assumes that quantum systems possess physical states @xmath0 which are solely responsible for determining the outcomes of experiments performed on the quantum systems , then no two distinct quantum states @xmath1 and @xmath2 can share the same physical state @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that any quantum state @xmath1 is uniquely co - ordinated with a subset of the @xmath0 and therefore should itself be regarded as a physical property of the quantum system . in the terms of ref .",
    "[ ] , models of quantum mechanics that assume there are physical states are classified as @xmath3__-epistemic _ _ if there are two states which share the same physical state @xmath0 and as @xmath3__-ontic _ _ if there is no pair of states which share the same @xmath0 .",
    "thus pbr show that all such models of quantum mechanics are @xmath3-ontic .",
    "hall has shown that the assumptions used in the pbr theorem can be weakened and so the theorem can be generalised @xcite .",
    "colbeck and renner @xcite have reached the same conclusion as pbr via a different route and furthermore concluded that the quantum state is the _ only _ physical property of the quantum system .",
    "the experimental protocol for the pbr theorem @xcite requires a minimum of @xmath4 sources of the two arbitrary states @xmath5 and @xmath2 that are involved .",
    "when @xmath6 , @xmath7 sources are required and as @xmath8 , @xmath9 . as @xmath10 becomes larger , the experimental error that can be tolerated becomes smaller @xcite . as well as gates which operate on the individual states ,",
    "the protocol requires an @xmath10-bit entangling gate operating without post - selection .",
    "it is interesting to investigate alternative experimental protocols to implement the pbr strategy for three reasons .",
    "firstly , alternative protocols may be easier to implement experimentally .",
    "secondly , the pbr result is a very strong result because it applies to _ any _ two quantum states . proving the result for any two quantum states",
    "is necessary to deal with the formal definition of @xmath3-epistemic @xcite ( see above ) .",
    "however a @xmath3-epistemic model which literally had just two states which share the same @xmath0 would be artificial and unphysical .",
    "therefore @xmath3-epistemic defined in those terms imposes an unnecessarily harsh burden on experiments designed to distinguish between @xmath3-ontic and @xmath3-epistemic models .",
    "it has already been noted @xcite that one could require that a model is @xmath3-epistemic only if _ every _ pair of non - orthogonal states share some physical states @xmath0 ( although that definition is not adopted in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "it seems that it should be persuasive to prove that _ a significant proportion _ of non - artificially chosen pairs of states do not share the same @xmath0 because that would rule out all but artificially contrived @xmath3-epistemic models .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile investigating protocols which lead to weaker versions of the pbr theorem .",
    "thirdly , hall @xcite has pointed out that ( i ) the pbr theorem requires the assumption of measurement independence ( mi ) , namely that the properties described by @xmath0 are uncorrelated with the choice of the measurement performed on the states but ( ii ) only one measurement procedure for each pair of states is required so a limited form of the pbr theorem , not requiring mi but restricted to that measurement being performed , is possible @xcite . having a second experimental protocol available supports the assumption that the pbr theorem applies independently of the fate of the quantum systems involved .",
    "the general approach of this section depends entirely on the strategy set out in ref . .",
    "we assume that there is a physical state @xmath0 associated with a quantum system and that @xmath0 alone is responsible for the outcome of any experiment on the quantum system .",
    "the quantum state @xmath1 associated with the quantum system allows the probabilities of the experimental outcomes to be determined . if a quantum system can possess the same physical state when it is in the state @xmath1 as when it is in the state @xmath2 , the two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be said to be conjoint . the set of physical states that @xmath1 and @xmath2 could have in common will be called @xmath11 .",
    "states which have no physical states in common , i.e. @xmath11 is empty , will be said to be disjoint .",
    "the set @xmath11 must be empty for orthogonal states because , for certain measurements , they never produce the same result , i.e. orthogonal states are disjoint and so there is no need to consider orthogonal states further here .",
    "two arbitrary , distinct states @xmath1 and @xmath2 lie in a two - dimensional subspace and can be mapped onto spin states on a bloch sphere . if @xmath12 so that @xmath13 we can write the states , in the laboratory co - ordinate system , as    @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is spin up ( down ) along the @xmath16-axis ( in units of @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 because we consider distinct , non - orthogonal states .",
    "we will also be concerned with the state @xmath19 which is orthogonal to @xmath2 in the subspace spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath20 the states are shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) .        in each run of the experiment",
    ", alice produces either the state @xmath21 or @xmath22 and bob produces either the state @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the spins from alice and bob are allowed to interact via a heisenberg xyz hamiltonian @xmath25 where , with energy measured in appropriate units , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real , dimensionless constants and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the pauli matrices in the laboratory co - ordinate system . the eigenvalues @xmath30 and eigenstates @xmath31 of @xmath32 are @xmath33 the eigenstates are the bell states and they are non - degenerate because @xmath26 . in each run , the experiment consists of determining which of the eigenstates @xmath34 is occupied .",
    "this could be done by switching the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) on for a period of time so that each of the four joint states , @xmath35 , etc , evolves into a combination of the bell states that it is not orthogonal with , removing the interaction and performing a bell measurement .",
    "each of the four joint states that can be produced by alice and bob are orthogonal to one of the @xmath34 : @xmath36    assuming alice and bob produce their states independently ( this assumption can be weakened @xcite ) , the joint physical state @xmath37 . now assume that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are conjoint and that @xmath1 and @xmath19 are conjoint . consider a run of the experiment in which @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is not possible for @xmath40 to produce any of the outcomes because ( i ) @xmath40 is produced in conjunction with one of the four joint states @xmath35 , etc , ( ii ) @xmath40 alone produces the outcome , ( iii ) according to eq .",
    "( [ eorthog ] ) , each of the four joint states forbids one of the outcomes and ( iv ) sooner or later @xmath40 will produce one of the outcomes which is forbidden by the state it is produced with .",
    "but one of the outcomes will occur , i.e. one of the eigenstates will be occupied , in any run of the experiment .",
    "therefore one of the assumptions must be false .",
    "we can conclude that , for any two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , either @xmath1 and @xmath2 are disjoint or @xmath1 and @xmath19 are disjoint , or both pairs are disjoint .",
    "in other words , if @xmath1 is conjoint with @xmath2 then it is disjoint with the state orthogonal to @xmath2 in the subspace spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we next consider spins interacting via the hamiltonian @xmath41 where , with energy measured in appropriate units , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath27 and @xmath44 are real , dimensionless constants .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath45 and eigenstates @xmath46 of @xmath47 are    @xmath48 \\nonumber \\\\ e'_4   & = &   -b + \\sqrt{(a+c)^2 + 4d^2 } , \\nonumber   \\\\ & & | e'_4 \\rangle   = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2 } [ -\\sin \\alpha(|   +   \\rangle _ a| +   \\rangle _ b + |   - \\rangle _ a| -   \\rangle _ b ) +   \\cos \\alpha ( |   +   \\rangle _ a| -   \\rangle _ b - |   -   \\rangle _ a| +   \\rangle _ b ) ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 the eigenstates are non - degenerate provided @xmath50 .",
    "this time we map the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of sect .",
    "iia onto the spin states    @xmath51 where again @xmath52 . the states are shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in each run of the experiment",
    ", alice produces either the state @xmath21 or @xmath22 and bob produces either the state @xmath23 or @xmath53 .",
    "the spins from alice and bob are allowed to interact via @xmath47 and a measurement is performed to determine which of the eigenstates @xmath54 is occupied . if the strengths of the components of spin - spin interaction can be chosen so that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is given in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , each of the four joint states that can be produced by alice and bob are orthogonal to one of the @xmath54 : @xmath58 therefore by the same argument @xcite as in sect .",
    "iia , we can conclude that if @xmath1 is conjoint with @xmath2 then it is disjoint with @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath60 , i.e. from eq .",
    "[ theta ] when @xmath61 , @xmath2 and @xmath59 are the same state and so we can conclude that any pair of distinct states @xmath1 and @xmath2 are disjoint if @xmath61 .",
    "thus the present protocol yields the same result as pbr for this special case .",
    "the hamiltonians in sec .",
    "ii are possible in principle because the spin - spin interaction tensor can take the required forms in @xmath62 and most lower symmetries @xcite .",
    "hamiltonians of the type proposed here have been considered in the quantum information processing ( qip ) context .    the original proposals for qip , e.g. quantum dots @xcite and nuclear spins @xcite , relied on the isotropic heisenberg spin - exchange interaction .",
    "sources of anisotropic contributions include spin - orbit coupling and the direct dipole - dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "they can be regarded as something to be corrected for @xcite or as an alternative means of creating entanglement with certain advantages @xcite .",
    "anisotropic exchange interactions of the type xy and xxz arise in some systems proposed for qip @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath32 in sec .",
    "iia is of the heisenberg xyz type which has been considered for qip purposes more recently @xcite .",
    "a hamiltonian due to a pure dipole - dipole interaction can lead to a hamiltonian of the xyz form for a limited range of values of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath47 in sec .",
    "iib can arise from an isotropic exchange interaction and the anti - symmetric part of the spin - orbit interaction , the dzyaloshinskii - moroya interaction , which is proportional to @xmath63 $ ] , with the unit vector @xmath64 joining the two spins in the @xmath65-direction .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moroya interaction is involved in systems proposed for qip @xcite .      hall @xcite has noted out that only one measurement procedure is involved in the pbr theorem . this is a significant difference compared with other  no - go \" theorems @xcite like the bell inequalities and the kochen - spekker theorem which require at least two independently chosen experiments to be carried out .",
    "that means that the other  no - go \" theorems can not be proven without the assumption of mi ( i.e. , that the physical state @xmath0 is uncorrelated with the choice of the measurement(s ) involved in proving the theorem ) . in the case of the pbr theorem , a limited form of",
    "the theorem applies without mi @xcite , namely that the pbr theorem applies when the states involved are subject to the measurement procedure required to prove the theorem .",
    "the present results are relevant to mi because a pbr - like result can be obtained from the quite different measurement procedure proposed here . for the case",
    "@xmath61 , the pbr result follows from both the experimental procedure in ref .  [ ] and the experimental procedure in sec .",
    "the fact that the same conclusion can be drawn from different experimental procedures supports the idea that the conclusion applies independently of the measurement procedure , or indeed that the conclusion applies when no joint measurement of the quantum systems takes place . of course ,",
    "even if the fate of the quantum systems does not affect the pbr theorem that does not mean that mi applies to the other  no - go \" theorems .",
    "hall has shown the other  no - go \" theorems are particularly vulnerable to even partially relaxing mi @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that pbr - like results can be obtained with experimental protocols different from the one used in ref .  [ ] and that the pbr result itself can be obtained in the case when the overlap between the two states involved is @xmath61 .",
    "an advantage of the present experimental protocols is that only two sources of the states is required for all values of @xmath66 . from both protocols used here",
    ", one can conclude that if two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 are conjoint then @xmath1 is disjoint with two related states @xmath19 and @xmath59 . the weaker result ( except for the case @xmath61 ) obtained here is not necessarily a disadvantage because it would be unreasonable to maintain the @xmath3-epistemic interpretation for some pairs of states when it is ruled out for most pairs of states .",
    "finally , the existence of alternative experimental protocols leading to similar results to pbr , and the same result for a special case , supports the assumption of mi required for the pbr theorem .",
