    "<S> we apply the result to the case of one - dimensional quantum bosonic gases with dipolar interaction in a harmonic trap , using an energy functional deduced from quantum monte carlo computations . </S>",
    "<S> we find an universal scaling behavior peculiar of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid , a signature that can be eventually probed by bragg spectroscopy in experimental realizations of such systems . </S>"
