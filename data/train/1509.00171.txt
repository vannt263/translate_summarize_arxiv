    "in the 1940 s , tolman proposed that animals build an internal representation  a cognitive map  of their environment and that this map allows the animal to perform space - dependent tasks such as navigating paths , finding shortcuts , and remembering the location of their nest or food source @xcite .",
    "three decades later , okeefe and dostrovsky discovered pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus , named _",
    "place cells _",
    ", that become active only in a particular region of the environment  their respective _ place fields _",
    "@xcite ( figure  [ figure1]a ) .",
    "the striking spatial selectivity of these place cells led okeefe and nadel @xcite to suggest that they form a neuronal basis of tolman s cognitive map , thus providing this abstract concept with a concrete neurophysiological basis . in the ensuing decades",
    ", it was realized that there are many brain regions involved in cognitive mapping of the environment @xcite , yet there is still no consensus on either the physiological mechanisms of this phenomenon or the theoretical principles that explain them @xcite .",
    "overall , it is believed that individual cells encode elements of the cognitive map , much like contributing pieces to a jigsaw puzzle . however , this analogy is not direct : the spiking activity of each separate neuron has no intrinsic spatial or geometrical properties ",
    "these properties appear only at the population level , emerging from the synchronous spiking activity of large neuronal ensembles @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown , i.e. , there exists a disconnect between the level of individual neurons from which the preponderance of neurophysiological data is acquired and the level of neuronal ensembles where the large - scale representations of space are believed to emerge @xcite .    in a recently proposed a model of spatial learning @xcite , we attempted to bridge this gulf by combining recent experimental results pointing out the topological nature of the hippocampal map @xcite and methods of algebraic topology .",
    "this model allowed demonstrating that place cell activity can encode an accurate topological map of the environment and estimating the time needed to accumulate the required connectivity information . further analyses of the model suggested to us that it is indicative of a more general theoretical framework that may lead to a systematic understanding of how spiking activity of neurons can be integrated to produce large - scale characteristics of space . in this paper",
    ", we outline the general principle and provide four specific models , which we call schemas , of integrating the activity of simulated neurons into a coherent representation of the explored environment . for each schema",
    "we find that a large - scale spatial map is produced within a short , biologically plausible period , which could be used to estimate the spatial learning time in different environments .",
    "a schema model of a cognitive map contains the following three key components :     m environment ( left ) and 200 randomly scattered place fields ( clusters of colored dots ) produced by place cells with a mean firing rate @xmath0 hz and a mean place field size @xmath1 cm . *",
    "b*. schematic representation of three overlapping assemblies of place cells ( shown by black dots ) that project synaptically onto their respective readout neurons ( blue pentagons ) . the active place cells ( black dots with red centers ) of the ignited cell assembly ( in the middle of the figure )",
    "produce spike trains that drive the spiking activity of the readout neuron ( blue pentagon with the red center).,title=\"fig : \" ]    * i. an abstract schema * @xmath2 represents the spatial information contained in the map at any given time .",
    "it consists of a set of formal regions @xmath3 and a set of relationships , @xmath4 , that express how these regions combine .",
    "we presume that each region @xmath5 in the schema can be related to any other region @xmath6 through a chain of relationships with intermediate regions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , ... , @xmath9 .",
    "a specific selection of the relationships included in @xmath10 determines the type of spatial information encoded in the schema and the global arrangement of the encoded regions , which is crucial both for the properties of the resulting map as well as for the information encoded in it .    *",
    "the neural implementation * , @xmath11 , is a neural network that encodes the schema @xmath12 . for the sake of simplicity , we model @xmath11 using a basic , two layer , feed - forward neural network inspired by cell assembly theory @xcite , which consists of a layer of cells that represent regions of space and another layer of readout neurons that represent the relationships between these regions ( figure  [ figure1]b ) .",
    "when a cell @xmath13 fires a spike , we say that the region @xmath5 is `` active '' ; otherwise it is `` latent '' @xcite .",
    "when a readout neuron fires a spike , we say that the corresponding relationship is `` instantiated . ''",
    "thus , by construction , the relationships between regions are represented via temporal relationships between the spike trains and by the parameters of synaptic connections between the two layers in @xmath11 .",
    "* iii . the spatial map and the representing space*. the goal of introducing schemas is to model the assemblage of the cognitive maps from the cells spiking activity .",
    "however , in absence of a mechanism explaining how spatial representations emerge from the spike trains , this task remains undefined .",
    "statements such as `` a given place cell s activity encodes a region '' or `` the coactivity of a set of place cells represents a spatial overlap between the encoded regions '' require an interpretation . in the analysis of electrophysiological data ,",
    "this interpretation is acquired by mapping the neuronal activity into an auxiliary , external space @xmath14 which is selected according to the experimenters best judgment .",
    "for example , constructing the place fields by ascribing cartesian @xmath15 coordinates to the place cells spikes and identifying the areas where the spikes cluster is one attempt to map the unobservable formal regions encoded in the cognitive map into observable regions of the spatial environment @xcite . in the following discussion",
    ", we will refer to this algorithm as to _ standard place field mapping_. spaces that have been used to interpret the activity of place cells and other cells include euclidean domains in one @xcite and in three dimensions @xcite ; circles @xcite , tori @xcite , spheres @xcite , and even klein bottles @xcite . to capture this aspect of cognitive map analysis",
    ", we define a _ spatial mapping _ from the schema @xmath12 to a representing space @xmath14 , @xmath16 in which the formal regions of @xmath12 are mapped into the `` concrete '' regions of @xmath14 , @xmath17 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath18 as the @xmath14-_representations of the formal region _",
    "@xmath19 and to the resulting layout of the representing regions in @xmath14 as the _ spatial _ map of the schema , @xmath20 .",
    "although the representing regions are selected to reproduce the relationships between the formal regions as well as possible , the resulting map does not always capture the structure of the original schema : some relationships may be lost in the mapping or the mapping may produce relationships between the representing regions that are not encoded in @xmath12 .",
    "for example , the place field maps are believed to reflect an animal s cognitive map s structure but their faithfulness has not been established or even addressed in the neurophysiological literature . in the case when the set of relationships between the regions @xmath18 ( @xmath21 ) matches the schematic relationships exactly , so that @xmath22 , the mapping will be referred to as _",
    "faithful_. the corresponding spatial map may then be viewed as a model of @xmath12 , i.e. , the structure of @xmath12 can be deduced from the layout of the representing regions .",
    "thus , each specific schema model includes these three components  the abstract schema @xmath12 , its neuronal network implementation @xmath11 and the spatial mapping ( 1 ) into a representing space @xmath14 . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to this triad as to `` schema , '' when no ambiguities can arise .",
    "a key property of our approach , crucial for modeling spatial learning , is that schemas are dynamic objects . as an animal explores a novel environment , new regions",
    "become represented by the activity of place cells and new relationships are inferred from the spike trains temporal patterns @xcite . according to the standard approach of neural network theory ,",
    "the process of learning a schema may be viewed as the process of training the readout neurons to represent the set @xmath10 by detecting repetitive patterns in the incoming spike trains . from this perspective",
    ", a schema is learned after its network is trained , i.e. , after the readout neurons stop adopting their spiking responses to the patterns of the incoming spike trains .",
    "on the other hand , from a cognitive perspective , the purpose of spatial learning is to acquire qualitative , large - scale characteristics of the environment , which enable spatial planning , spatial navigation and spatial reasoning , such as path connectivity , shortcuts and obstacles , geometric and topological properties , global symmetries and so forth .",
    "such large - scale characteristics of the environment that are captured through the relationships of a given schema will be referred to as _ schema integrals _ , @xmath23 .",
    "below we demonstrate that the minimal time @xmath24 required for the schema s integrals to emerge is typically shorter than the time , @xmath25 , required to train all readout neurons , i.e. , large - scale information can be extracted from a partially trained network .",
    "thus , the schema approach captures two complementary aspects of spatial learning : _ physiological learning_the process of forming and training the cell assembly network and _ schematic _ or _ cognitive learning_the emergence of information about the global structure of space , expressed as the corresponding production of schema integrals .",
    "what aspect of space is represented in the hippocampal map ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on the information captured by the readout neurons in the hippocampal cell assemblies .",
    "since correlating neuronal spiking with geometrical properties of the representing space sometimes produces useful interpretations of electrophysiological data , most authors assume that the spiking patterns of place cells encode geometric properties of space @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that combining the spiking activity of a relatively small number of place cells with the information about the sizes , shapes , and locations of their respective place fields allows a reconstruction of the animal s trajectory in a typical experimental enclosure on a moment - to - moment basis @xcite",
    ".    however , the read - out neurons have access only to the place cells spikes , and not to their respective place fields .",
    "obtaining the shape and size of any given place field , which is nothing but a cumulative spatial histogram of spikes used for illustrational purposes , requires accumulating a substantial number of spikes from the corresponding place cell . yet",
    "the spike trains produced during the activity period of a given place cell are short  typically hundreds of milliseconds in duration  and highly variable , not only because of the animal s movements , but also because of the intrinsic stochasticity of neuronal spiking @xcite .",
    "thus , the spike trains of place cells contain little information about a place field , such as its shape , location and other computationally expensive parameters .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental studies point out that these spike trains do not provide the geometric information on the synaptic integration timescale of seconds or fractions of a second @xcite .    since the temporal pattern of place cell firing is the only information available to downstream neurons , a physiologically adequate class of schemas of the hippocampal map may be constructed based on capturing _ qualitative _ , topological relationships between regions , e.g. , overlap , adjacency , ordering and containment , from the temporal relationships between the spike trains @xcite .",
    "the resulting maps will then produce a topological representation of space rather than a geometrical one @xcite , in which the relative arrangement of the locations is more important than mapping the precise positions .",
    "topological schemas have several advantages over the more precise geometric schemas , e.g. , higher stability ( e.g. , faithfulness of a topological map is not destroyed under continuous deformations of the representing space ) and lower computational cost , which may make them biologically more viable ( see discussion ) .",
    "there remain many possibilities in which to read out qualitative information about the spike trains and thus there are many topological schemas . in this perspective ,",
    "a particular readout mechanism , which responds to specific patterns of place cell coactivity , defines the type of spatial information encoded in the schema .",
    "the following discussion presents four different topological schemas based on different qualitative relations between regions and the rate at which these schemas are acquired .",
    "the simplest topological schema is based on binary connections : its set of relationships consists of pairs of connected regions , @xmath27 .",
    "such schema can be viewed as a graph , @xmath28 , whose vertices are linked if the corresponding regions are related according to @xmath29 ( figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding neuronal implementation is produced by training the pair - coactivity detector readout neurons to respond to nearly simultaneous spiking of their respective pair of presynaptic cells @xcite .",
    "in other words , physiological learning of a graph schema @xmath26 amounts to detecting pairs of cells that exhibit frequent coactivity @xcite .",
    "is in the schema , but @xmath30 is not.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we modeled this process by simulating place cell spiking activity induced by a rat s movements across a place field map in a small environment ( figure  [ figure1]b ) . to simplify the analyses , we assume that as soon as the coactivity occurs , the corresponding connection is immediately `` learned , '' i.e. , incorporated into the schema . as a result , at every moment of time @xmath31 ,",
    "the connectivity matrix of the graph is defined by the coactivity observed prior to that moment .",
    "thus , @xmath32 if cells @xmath13 and @xmath33 cofired before t and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "figure  [ figure3]a shows that the number of links in the graph , which is the number of recruited pair - coincidence detectors , grows as the schema is learned and saturates at ca .",
    "@xmath35 mins , i.e. , after this time new incoming spike trains do not produce new connections in @xmath36 .",
    "the saturation of the schema could be a trivial result if the graph becomes fully connected or remains mostly empty .",
    "a simple characteristic capturing the efficiency of @xmath26 , which generalizes to other schemas in a natural way is its entropy @xcite .",
    "this is the specific entropy of the readout neurons , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the fractions of the connected and disconnected vertex pairs in the graph . for",
    "a fully discrete ( @xmath40 ) or a fully connected graph ( @xmath41 ) the entropy vanishes and maximal entropy @xmath42 is achieved for @xmath43 ( in which case the absence of a link is as informative as its presence ) .",
    "figure  [ figure3]b demonstrates that for the place cell ensemble used in our simulations ( see methods ) , the entropy of the graph schema asymptotically approaches a maximal value of about @xmath44 in about five minutes , a value implying that the schema network @xmath36 is neither underloaded nor oversaturated .    to quantify the correspondence between the schema @xmath26 and its place field map @xmath45 , we calculated the entropy @xmath46 , of the occurrences of place field pairwise overlaps across time and compared @xmath46 to @xmath47 . figure  [ figure3]b demonstrates that both entropies remain close throughout the entire learning period , indicating that the complexity of the place field layout remains similar to the complexity of the encoded relationships at all times .",
    "in addition to this correspondence we also computed the mutual information ( mi , see methods ) between the place field overlap and place cell coactivities , which also grows with the rat s navigational experience ( figure  [ figure3]b ) .",
    "thus , we have convergent lines of evidence indicating efficient spatial learning captured by the graph schema .        as a cognitive map model , the graph schema @xmath26 provides a stratum for implementing graph - theoretical navigation algorithms , that is , for establishing paths connecting spatial locations @xcite .",
    "its integrals @xmath48 are the global characteristics of the region - to - region connectivity graph , e.g. , its partitioning , the colorability of its vertexes and edges @xcite , its planarity , and the existence of a path between two given vertexes . as an example of such large - scale characteristics we identified the shortest paths connecting pairs of the most distant vertexes and computed the time required to establish these connections .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ figure3]c demonstrate that the animal establishes connections between the most distant locations in the graph in about @xmath49 minutes , a time when only about @xmath50 of the readout neurons are trained .",
    "similarly , emergence of the information required to establish existence of a circuit of the graph which traverses each edge exactly once , called an eulerian path , takes about @xmath51 minutes , while the correct number of cliques in @xmath26 , which are sets of pairwise connected vertices , can be deduced within two minutes .",
    "these observations suggest that the emergence of schema integrals before the network is trained may be a general phenomenon .",
    "b. * b*. the existence of the two - dimensional simplexes , corresponding to higher order coactivity relationships , permits the links to be deformed .",
    "this is illustrated for paths @xmath53 and @xmath54 : the transformation can be visualized by slipping one path across the two - dimensional facets , thus demonstrating the topological equivalence between paths @xmath53 and @xmath54 . *",
    "c*. the nerve of the map shown on figure  [ figure1]b matches the simplicial schema.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a topological schema may be based on representing not only binary , but also ternary , quaternary and other higher - order connectivity relations between spatial domains .",
    "for example , a schema may represent the overlaps between regions , including triple , quadruple , etc . , overlaps .",
    "the key property of the overlap relation is that if @xmath55 regions , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , ... , @xmath19 , have a common intersection , then so does any subcollection of them .",
    "the simplest mathematical object that is closed under the operation of taking non - empty subsets is an abstract simplex , which can be viewed as a list of @xmath55 elements @xcite .",
    "hence , a @xmath58-order overlap relationship @xmath59 may be represented by a @xmath55-dimensional simplex @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "a set of overlap relationships therefore forms an abstract simplicial complex , @xmath52 , and we will hence refer to a higher order overlap schema as to simplicial schema .    under the standard mapping of the place cell spiking activity into the environment ,",
    "the simplicial schemas relationships , @xmath61 , represent the overlaps between the place fields .",
    "for example , the place field map shown in figure  [ figure2]b can be faithfully encoded by a simplicial schema with four @xmath62 order relationships @xmath63 and an additional binary relation @xmath64 , as shown in figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "the neuronal marker of these overlaps is the spiking coactivity : if the animal enters a location where several place fields overlap , their respective place cells produce ( with a certain probability ) temporally overlapping spike trains .",
    "hence the neural network implementation of a simplicial schema , @xmath65 , should be built to detect the coactivity events , using coincidence detector readout neurons ( which , in fact , corresponds to the current view on the hippocampal cell assembly network organization @xcite ) .",
    "physiological learning of a simplicial schema hence amounts to training the readout neurons to detect place cell coactivities .",
    "our learning algorithm ( see methods ) ensures that , at every stage of learning , only the highest order relationships are kept while the redundant lower - order relationships are eliminated .",
    "for example , pairwise connections between three neurons become redundant after a triple coactivity between them is detected , at which point the three pair - detector readout neurons can be replaced with a single triple - coincidence detector .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that , as the rat explores the environment , the more probable , lower - order coactivity events are captured first and the less probable higher order coactivities accumulate more slowly ( figure  [ figure5]a ) .",
    "moreover , although rapid changes of the readout neurons order stops after five or six minutes , slow regroupings continue during the entire navigation period , @xmath66 minutes .",
    "thus , unlike the pairwise overlaps in @xmath26 that can be instantly identified , the orders of the readout neurons can not be deduced from a single coactivity event . in this sense , the orders of the readout neurons are integral characteristics of place cells spiking activity , and therefore may be viewed as integrals of the simplicial schema .",
    "the mutual information between these two variables is computed along the trajectory ( green).,title=\"fig : \" ]    there exists an additional important set of @xmath52-integrals , which capture the topology of the representing space .",
    "this property of the simplicial schemas can be illustrated using the ech theorem , which states that the pattern of overlaps between regions @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ... , @xmath69 , covering a topological space @xmath70 ,",
    "encodes homological invariants of @xmath14 , provided that every intersection @xmath71 is contractible @xcite .",
    "the proof is based on building the `` nerve '' of the covering  a simplicial complex , the @xmath72-dimensional simplexes of which correspond to the @xmath73-fold overlaps between covering regions , and showing that it is topologically equivalent to @xmath14 ( figure  [ figure4]c ) .",
    "this theorem implies that the spatial map of a sufficiently rich simplicial schema may encode the topology of the space navigated by the rat , and suggests that if this map is faithful , i.e. , if the nerve of the spatial map matches the schema s relationship set @xmath61 exactly , then the schema also captures the large - scale topological representation of the space .    to study the correspondence between the simplicial schema and its map , we compared the schema s entropy @xmath74 , defined by the probabilities for a readout neuron to become a @xmath75-order co - activity detector , to the entropy @xmath46 of the place field map @xmath76 , defined via the probabilities of producing a @xmath75-order overlap between the place fields ( figure  [ figure5]b ) .",
    "as shown on figure  [ figure5]c , both entropies closely follow one another : they both grow initially and reach similar asymptotes in approximately four minutes .",
    "however , the mutual information between these two series of events decreases with time .",
    "the reason for this effect lies in the idealized nature of the representing regions @xmath18 , built as convex hulls of the spike clusters in the two - dimensional environment ( for other place field construction algorithms see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath18 s crisp boundaries produce high - order overlaps , which are not captured by the place cell coactivity and hence by the schema  compare the orders of the readout neurons on figure  [ figure5]a with the orders of overlap between the corresponding representing regions @xmath18 in figure  [ figure5]b .",
    "( black line ) corresponds to a sequence of simplexes  a simplicial path @xmath77 that represents @xmath78 in @xmath52 .",
    "* b*. the dynamics of the total number of zero - dimensional loops ( red ) and one - dimensional loops ( blue ) . unlike the growing number of links in the graph schema ( figure  [ figure2]a ) , the number of topological loops decreases with time",
    ". eventually , a single loop survives .",
    "the margins of error are shown above and below each graph by a pair of pink and light - blue lines , respectively . *",
    "c*. the barcodes  timelines of the one - dimensional loops in the simplicial complex .",
    "the topological noise vanishes after ca . 4 minutes , which is the schematic estimate of the cognitive learning time.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this result can be viewed from several perspectives .",
    "first , it illustrates that the scope of reliable information that can be drawn from the spatial map is limited : only sufficiently robust , qualitative aspects of the place field map , such as low dimensional overlaps , can be trusted .",
    "second , the regions @xmath5 that were originally introduced as `` formal , '' that is , devoid of intrinsic properties , should fundamentally be viewed as `` fuzzy '' and not as euclidean domains with crisp boundaries @xcite .",
    "direct computations show that the coactivity complexes do , in fact , capture the topology of the representing space , provided that the place cells spiking parameters fall into the biological domain @xcite , and hence that simplicial schemas provide a framework for representing topological information .",
    "for example , cell assemblies ignited along the physical paths traversed by the animal correspond to sequences of coactivity simplexes  the simplicial paths that represent the physical paths in @xmath79 ( figure  [ figure6]a ) .",
    "the structure of the simplicial paths allows establishing topological ( in)equivalences between navigational paths , e.g. , topologically equivalent simplicial paths represent physical paths that can be deformed into one another , a non - contractible simplicial path corresponds to a class of the physical paths that enclose inaccessible or yet unexplored parts of the environment . as a result ,",
    "the simplicial schema produces a qualitative description of navigational routes : while the total number of paths grows exponentially , the number of topologically distinct loops , which represent topologically distinct paths is small ( figure  [ figure6]b ) .",
    "however , this information does not emerge immediately : as the animal begins to navigate a new environment , most topological loops reflect transient connections .",
    "as the spiking information accumulates , these `` spurious '' loops disappear and only the loops that correspond to the physical signatures of the environment persist ( figure  [ figure6]c ) . with methods drawn from persistent homology theory @xcite one can determine the minimal period @xmath24 required for removing the spurious loops , which provides a theoretical estimate of the time required to learn the environment @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure6]c demonstrates that in our test map , after @xmath80 minutes most topological loops have vanished and only the loops that correspond to the physical holes in the environment survive .",
    "thus , as in the case of the graph schema , the topological connectivity of the cognitive map is captured by the simplicial schema before the underlying neuronal network is fully trained , @xmath81 .",
    "although a sufficiently rich simplicial schema can capture the topological invariants of the representing space @xmath14 as its integrals , it does not capture all the qualitative topological aspects of the connectivity between regions .",
    "for example , the identical simplicial schema ( represented by a tetrahedron ) can faithfully represent the overlap relationships in the two maps shown in figure  [ figure7 ] , because both maps contain the same set of regions @xmath83 and one fourth - order overlap relation @xmath84 , as well as all their consequent ternary and binary sub - relations . however , these maps are topologically different , since they can not be transformed from one into another by a continuous deformation of the plane @xmath85 .",
    "the obstruction to such deformation is that the region @xmath86 on figure  [ figure7]a is contained in the union of the regions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90 , and no containment relationships exist between any combinations of the regions on figure  [ figure7]b .",
    "neither a graph schema @xmath26 nor a simplicial schema @xmath52 can capture this difference ; what is required is the additional covering relation , @xmath91 , ( @xmath92s are covered by @xmath93s ) , in terms of which the map on figure  [ figure7]a is described by the relationship @xmath94 , whereas the regions shown on figure  [ figure7]b produce no containment relation . the cover relation produces a new  mereological ",
    "schema @xmath82 , in which the information is encoded in terms of topological containment ( figure  [ figure7]c ) . the intuition behind neuronal implementation of",
    "the formal cover relation is the following .",

    ", @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath86 form a quadruple overlap in both cases . however , in map shown in * a * , the region @xmath86 is contained in the union of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the map shown in * b * , @xmath86 is not covered .",

    "the covering regions are connected by red links ( e.g. , @xmath102 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) and the red arrows point to the covered region ( e.g. , @xmath103 ) . *",
    "d*. a neuronal implementation of the covering relationship includes three inhibitory neurons ( magenta ) that provide inhibitory input into the readout neuron ( purple ) .",
    "if each inhibitory input of an active interneuron exceeds the excitatory input of the driving cell @xmath104 , the readout neuron can spike only if the activity of the cell @xmath104 is not accompanied by the inputs from any of the cells @xmath105 , @xmath106 or @xmath107 . as a result",
    ", the readout neuron will remain silent as long as the activity of the cells @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 temporally covers the activity of cell @xmath104.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the cover relationship can be implemented , e.g. , by a combination of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons shown on figure  [ figure7]d . in such a cell assembly , the readout neuron signals a violation of the cover relationship , i.e. , the latter is represented by an absence of the readout neurons spiking activity up to the moment @xmath31 .",
    "hence , in contrast with simplicial schemas , where readout neurons learn to detect ever higher - order coactivities , a readout neuron in a mereological schema @xmath82 learns to detect ever larger groups of cells that together inhibit its activity ( figure  [ figure7]d ) .    similarly to the overlap orders in @xmath52 , the cover relationships , as a rule , can not be deduced from a single coactivity event .",
    "thus , these relationships represent integral information that can be viewed as the @xmath82-integrals which characterize the large - scale topology of a space .",
    "we are currently unaware of additional mereological algorithms that would allow large - scale computations of the environment s global topological characteristics , similar to computing the homological invariants in a simplicial schema .",
    "nevertheless , a mereological schema encodes an important type of topological information , which may be used in physiological neural networks to represent spatial maps .",
    "in general , covering relationships can be established between arbitrary ( including multiply connected ) regions . as a result , the number of possible combinations of covered and covering regions dramatically increases .",
    "even if the covered region @xmath108 is spatially `` bundled '' ( e.g. , if each pair @xmath109 and @xmath110 is coactive at some moment of time , so that @xmath100 forms a connectivity clique ) the selection of possible covering regions remains very large . therefore , in order to test the development of cover relationships in time , we opted to limit our study to neuron pairs covering an individual neuron ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .    , and a covered cell , @xmath113 .",
    "each line corresponds to a specific choice of @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "each line begins as soon as the covering relationship is detected and stops as soon as it is violated , that is , as soon as the readout neuron shown in figure  [ figure7]d would fire .",
    "note that the majority of relationships are short - lived : a large number of spurious relationships are detected at the beginning of exploration .",

    "important examples of s are the region connection calculi ( ) formal logical theories based on a family of binary topological relations between regions @xcite . for example , the most basic theory , , which applies to the case of regions with fuzzy boundaries , is built using the five relations shown in figure  [ figure9]a : disconnect ( ) , partial overlap ( ) , proper part and its inverse ( and ) , and equality ( ) @xcite . in terms of these relations ,",

    "these qualitative features produce fundamental differences in spatial reasoning required for navigating the corresponding environments .",
    "for example , the junction point on the w - tracks , which are often used in behavioral experiments ( figure  [ figure9]c ) , forces an animal to choose between a right or left turn , which is reflected in the place cell code @xcite .",
    "the theory allows capturing such features , e.g. , distinguishing between the @xmath98- and @xmath120-tracks , which , from the perspective of algebraic topology , are but contractible manifolds ( figure  [ figure9]d ) .",
    ", pp@xmath130 , @xmath130 and @xmath130 between the regions can be imitated by partial overlap , depending on the shape of the trajectory , which shows that these relations can not be directly deduced from the spike train structure .",
    "* b*. the transitions between the relationships , showing the immediate conceptual neighborhood ( continuity table ) structure of .",
    "these are the possible sequences of gradual transformation of the relationships .",
    "for example , if at some moment of time two regions , @xmath118 and @xmath117 , were disconnected ( @xmath130 ) then this relationship can not instantly jump to a containment relationship ( pp@xmath130 or @xmath130 ) without going through , at least instantaneously , the partially overlapping ( @xmath130 ) relationship.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to model spatial learning based on a specific approach , one can construct an schema , in which the readout neurons are trained to recognize the appropriate set of binary relationships . however , an important aspect of constructions is that the set of relationships that can be simultaneously imposed on a set of regions is restricted @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath118 and @xmath117 partially overlap and @xmath117 is a proper subset of @xmath131 , then @xmath131 and @xmath118 must have a non - null intersection and @xmath131 can not be a subset of @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , we define an schema @xmath116 as a schema with a set of _ consistent _ relations between regions .    to model the process of physiological learning in the ( @xmath119 ) schema , we trained five types of readout neurons to recognize the five relationships , starting from the initial relationship .",
    "this however requires more complex algorithms than in @xmath26 and @xmath52 schemas : while the partial temporal overlap can always be interpreted as partial spatial overlap , other temporal relationships can not be uniquely assigned to a spatial relation ( figure  [ figure10]a ) .",
    "for example , passing through two partially overlapping regions along a particular trajectory can generate a temporal disconnect , a temporal cover , or a temporal equality relationship between two spike trains which can be mistaken for spike trains produced by a , / , or relationship , respectively .",
    "because of this ambiguity , the spiking activity of the presynaptic cells in the cell assemblies produced during individual runs through a pair of place fields can invoke different interpretations of the spatial relationships .",
    "thus , learning a @xmath119 schema rests on encoding , at each moment , the best guesses for the relationships between pairs of regions and then updating them based on the available spiking history and the qualitative analogue of continuity constraints , as shown in figure  [ figure10]b .    in our simulations ,",
    "the relationships evolved rapidly and saturated within about @xmath132 minutes from the onset of the exploration ( figure  [ figure11]a ) .",
    "figure  [ figure11]b shows that at the beginning of the exploration , the number of inconsistencies between independently trained readout neurons is high .",
    "subsequently , their number quickly diminishes as the information about coactivity is acquired .",
    "an increase in the number of relationships in figure  [ figure11]a produces a splash of inconsistencies occurring at about 3 minutes , which is at the time when the animal completes its first turn around the central hole .",
    "this phenomenon has the same origin as the splash of transient cover relationships occurring in the mereological schema @xmath82 ( figure  [ figure8 ] ) .",
    "as the statistical information about place cell coactivity accumulates , a stable set of relationship emerges .",
    "the schema s specific entropy , defined using the probabilities of observing all five relationships , saturates about the same time , @xmath132 minutes .",
    "the entropy of the relationships between the representing regions in the map @xmath133 remains similar to the schema entropy during the entire course of learning , reaching the asymptotic value of @xmath134 ( figure  [ figure11]c ) .",
    "moreover , the mutual information between the map and the schema increases with the acquisition of information in a way similar to the case of graph schema @xmath26 but unlike the case of simplicial schema @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "figures  [ figure11]c , [ figure3]c and [ figure5]e ) .",
    "once again , this data indicates that spatial maps built on regions with diffuse boundaries may better reflect the nature of the encoded regions . in the meantime , the integrals of the @xmath119 schema , i.e. , the combinations of relationships that represent the junction and the endpoints on the @xmath120 track , emerge from neuronal spiking in under @xmath135 minutes  much sooner than the readout neurons in @xmath119 network are trained .",
    "we have presented a framework for integrating the place cells spiking information into a global map of space , implemented via simple cell assembly neural networks , wired to encode spatial relationships .",
    "the approach is motivated by the experimental results @xcite and by the theoretical models proposed in @xcite and in @xcite . from the perspective of the current approach",
    "these models are particular implementations of the simplicial and the graph schema , respectively ; the mereological and the schemas are new  to our knowledge , such models have not yet been considered .    in the following we outline several important aspects of this framework and provide a general context for the model .",
    "* 4.1 emergence of the memory map in schemas*. there is a clear parallel between a coherent representation of space emerging from the integrated inputs of many individual neurons and a continuous state of matter ( e.g. , a solid or a liquid ) emerging from the collective dynamics of molecules . from a descriptive point of view",
    ", the common element in both phenomena is that neither macro - system can be reduced to a trivial aggregation of the properties of its elementary constituents .",
    "even when the properties at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels are well understood , it can be difficult to correlate the properties at one level with those at the other .",
    "for example , the measurement of the macroscopic properties of a liquid does not allow one to determine its molecular structure .",
    "conversely , a detailed description of the properties of a water molecule does not explain directly key phenomena of the physics of water .",
    "in physics , the solution to this problem historically proceeded from a simplified , phenomenological models , which bridged the gap between the microscopic and macroscopic levels of matter . in a similar way",
    ", the present discussion offers a testbed model with which to bridge the gap between place cells and the large - scale spatial map .    * 4.2 topological spatial maps*. topological maps",
    "have several biological advantages over geometric ( or topographic @xcite ) maps , which follow from the qualitative nature of topological relationships @xcite .",
    "first , natural environments are dynamic , so that it is often impossible for an animal to know when and how its navigational task may change . hence acquiring a qualitative map based on the invariants of the space of an environment ,",
    "may be biologically more effective than spending time on producing a computationally costly precise answer from mutable relationships between dynamic cues .",
    "one implication of this hypothesis is that in morphing environments the place fields will retain the pattern of topological connectivity and may adjust their shapes in order to compensate for the deformation of the representing space .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by experiments which demonstrate that place fields maintain their relative configurations in morphing environments @xcite and that place cell coactivity pattern in an animal traversing remains invariant over a significant range of geometric transformations @xcite .",
    "if the map is cartesian , i.e. , based on precise coordinates , distances , angles and so forth , such deformation can be achieved by redrawing the place fields at each stage of the deformation , via some complex path integration mechanism @xcite . from the topological perspective , the observed deformation of the place fields is simply a result of projecting the same stable neuronal map into a morphing environment , which does not require extra computations and hence may be biologically more plausible .    *",
    "schemas constrain the generation of intrinsic sequences in the hippocampus*. place cells become active in temporal sequences that either match with or are inverse to the spatial ordering of their place fields during the active , resting , or sleep states .",
    "initially , temporal sequences were observed after or during the recording of the place fields , leading various authors to suggest that the observed temporal sequences were a replay of sequences imprinted by sensory inputs @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments have observed temporal sequences that corresponded to trajectories along which the animal had never traveled @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experiments have revealed that temporal sequences observed before the animal entered an environment for the first time were predictive of the place field sequence measured later @xcite .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that temporal sequences are not merely replays of previously imprinted sequences @xcite .",
    "the better interpretation is that sequences are drawn from a pool of sequences that are intrinsic to the hippocampal network and this network structure gives rise to the location of place fields @xcite .",
    "the crisp ( for context representation , intrinsic sequences , and pattern completion ) theory goes further to argue that the intrinsic sequences in the hippocampus are crucial for the storage of episodic memories @xcite .",
    "however , this theory does not explain the origin or properties of such sequences .    in the schema framework ,",
    "all neural activity produced in the hippocampus has to be consistent with its schema .",
    "for example , in the graph schema , spontaneously replayed sequences of neural activity would have to be consistent with the connectivity of the graph .",
    "in other words , a cell @xmath13 may fire a spike after cell @xmath33 only if the relationship @xmath136 , or a chain of intermediate relationships @xmath137 , @xmath138 , ... , @xmath139 ,",
    "is present in @xmath140 .",
    "other schemas impose different constraints on which sequences can be produced , and the elements in the sequences may be ensembles of place cells , rather than single cells .",
    "in other words , schemas serve as `` topological templates '' off which sequences are generated .",
    "physiologically , this implies that the hippocampal network that implements a particular schema can produce sequences with specific `` grammar '' which may not have been directly imprinted or previously produced by the network .",
    "in fact , such offline state sequences of place cell activations , which the animal had never experienced , were recently observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , these sequences were consistent with the topology of the spatial environment @xcite .",
    "thus , schemas can explain the intrinsic sequences postulated by crisp theory as well as in preplay and replay .",
    "this intimate relationship between spontaneous sequences and schemas may be exploited in future investigations in order to infer the schema based on recordings of sequences or to predict the properties of intrinsic sequences from a given schema .",
    "spatial vs. non - spatial memories .",
    "* the hippocampus has been suggested to encode both spatial and nonspatial memories @xcite .",
    "for example , it plays a key role in the ability to remember visual , odor , action and memory sequences , and to put a specific memory episode into the context of preceding and succeeding events , as well as the ability to produce complete memory sequence from a single structured input @xcite . the topological view on the hippocampal spatial representations @xcite provides a common framework for understanding both spatial and nonspatial memory functions as manifestations of a single mechanism , which simply produces a topological arrangement of memory elements , irrespective of the nature of their content . according to this view",
    ", there is no principal difference between the internalized topological map of spatial locations and a topological map of memory sequences in the mnemonic domain .    *",
    "connections to experiment . *",
    "given the place cells spiking parameters and a hypothesis about how the downstream neurons might process place cell ( co)activity , a schematic computation can be used to assess the effectiveness of the corresponding spatial learning mechanism : how much time will be required to map a space , how many integrals can such mapping produce , how quickly these integrals will emerge and how stable they will be .",
    "this scope of computations suggests a possibility for experimental verifications of the proposed framework .",
    "for example , a decline in spatial learning caused by neurodegenerative diseases ( e.g. , in alzheimer s rat models ) , by aging or by psychoactive substances is assessed in behavioral experiments in terms of the extra times required to learn various memory tasks . on the other hand ,",
    "such cognitive changes are associated with changes in the place cell spiking parameters @xcite .",
    "it may therefore be possible to compare the downturn of spatial memory observed in topological learning tasks @xcite with the increase of the learning time(s ) estimated via a particular schema model for the same change in spiking variables .",
    "another alternative was suggested to us by our recent studies of hippocampal mapping of 3d spaces in bats , using two types of simplicial schemas .",
    "the results suggest that in the 3d case , the readout neurons in the place cell assemblies should operate by integrating synaptic inputs over working memory periods , rather than detecting coactivities on synaptic plasticity timescale @xcite . of course ,",
    "until these predictions are proved or disproved experimentally , their value is discussable ; meanwhile , the schema approach allows theoretical reasoning and generates predictions about hippocampal neurophysiology .",
    "* place cells*. spiking is produced by the rat s movement through the environment covered by the place fields ( figure  [ figure1]a - b ) .",
    "the poisson rate of the firing of place cells is a function of the animal s position @xmath141 at time @xmath31 , @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the maximal firing rate of cell @xmath13 , @xmath144 defines the width of its firing field centered at @xmath5 @xcite . in an @xmath145-cell ensemble ,",
    "the parameters @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , @xmath146 are modeled as random variables drawn from stationary unimodal distributions characterized by their respective means ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 ) and standard deviations ( see figure  [ figure1 ] and methods in @xcite ) . for the computations we used an ensemble with @xmath149 neurons , with mean firing rate @xmath150 hz and the mean place field size @xmath1 cm .",
    "larger ensembles typically affect the numerical values of the computed quantities , but not the essence of the phenomena described in the paper .",
    "this spiking is modulated by theta - oscillations , which are a subcortical eeg cycle in the hippocampus with a frequency of @xmath151 hz ( for details see @xcite ) .    * learning algorithm*. the physiological processes responsible for emergence of cell assemblies with readout neurons trained to integrate presynaptic inputs and to produce a particular response that `` actualizes '' the information encoded by the place cell coactivity are complex and multifaceted @xcite .",
    "for example , the readout neurons that encode place field overlap must identify a group of place cells and learn to respond to the coactivity of this specific group .",
    "however , what matters for our study , are the qualitative results of this process : the number of readout neurons , the order of the coactivity detected by these neurons , how this order grows in a typical cell assembly during the learning process and so forth .",
    "therefore , we set aside a neural network simulation of schema learning and employ the following schematic , phenomenological algorithm :    if a relationship @xmath152 of an appropriate type is detected , then :    1 .",
    "if @xmath152 is already listed in @xmath140 , ignore ; 2 .   else",

    "if @xmath152 provides nontrivial information , then add @xmath152 to @xmath140 .",
    "4 .   if the known relationships can be inferred from @xmath152 , then remove the redundant relationships .",
    "continue    steps 2 and 3 ensure that only the highest order relationships are kept in the schema , eliminating redundant , lower - order relationships . at the beginning",
    ", every state of the readout neurons can be empty and trained as the simulated animal explores a novel environment , or these states can be randomly initialized and then relearned . the transitions between the readout neuron types may be regarded as a rudimentary , schematic model of the synaptic plasticity mechanisms . in novel environments , place fields",
    "stabilize in about four minutes @xcite , even though cognitive learning of the environment may take days or even weeks @xcite .",
    "this implies that the readout neurons can be trained using constant spiking parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "* temporal relationships * between the spike trains and the physiological mechanisms underlying the downstream neurons readout process are in general very complex . for the sake of simplicity , we consider only the rate - based representation of neuronal activity @xcite , which allows for a variety of possibilities for encoding relationships .",
    "such relationships may entail that the firing rates of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons may be required to fall within a particular interval of values and the period of activity of a neuron @xmath13 may be required to precede , to follow , or to overlap with the activity of a neuron @xmath33 by a certain minimal , maximal or fixed amount of time @xcite .",
