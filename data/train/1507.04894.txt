    "under the highly extreme condition realized in the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been most probably created @xcite . to reveal the properties of qgp created there",
    ", the hydrodynamic model is utilized to study the time development of the extremely hot and dense matter . in particular , the large hadronic elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) observed in the experiments indicates that qgp is described by the relativistic hydrodynamic equation with a tiny viscosity , which may imply the creation of the strongly coupled matter @xcite ; however , see also refs .",
    "recent studies take into account such small viscous effects on the hydrodynamic expansion of the hot and dense matter to reveal the properties of qgp quantitatively , where a relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equation is an indispensable tool . a naive relativistic extension of the navie - stokes equation ,",
    "however , has fundamental problems such as ambiguity of flow velocity , existence of unphysical instabilities , and lack of causality , and we need to introduce the second - order hydrodynamic equation to avoid such problems .",
    "moreover , in the expanding object created in the experiments there are high density core which shows a nearly perfect fluidity and dilute corona in the peripheral region . in the latter part , more microscopic dynamics should be incorporated to the hydrodynamics since the viscous effect is too large to apply the naive viscous hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the second - order hydrodynamics actually include the mesoscopic dynamics and useful to analyze the hydrodynamic behavior of the spatially inhomogeneous matter @xcite .",
    "the way of formulation of the second - order hydrodynamics is , however , controversial and many kinds of equation are proposed .",
    "for instance , the israel - stewart equation , which is a kind of the second - order hydrodynamic equation widely used for the analyses of time development of the relativistic heavy ion collision or qgp , does not have established validity because ambiguous assumptions are imposed to derive it .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the solutions are different from those of the relativistic boltzmann equation quantitatively @xcite .",
    "recently , to eliminate the ambiguity in the derivation of hydrodynamics and perform systematic formulation , the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite has been applied to derive the second - order hydrodynamic equation for the single - component system both in the non - relativistic and relativistic cases @xcite as an extension of the first - order case @xcite : in this method , the boltzmann equation is faithfully solved to obtain the distribution function around the local equilibrium state without imposing any ansatz in a perturbation theory and the secular terms are resummed away into the would - be integral constants , which constitute the slow variables , i.e. , the hydrodynamical variables .",
    "it is also understood that , in the context of the reduction theory of dynamical systems @xcite , the hydrodynamical variables constitute the natural coordinates of the invariant / attractive manifold in the functional space spanned by the distribution function .",
    "then the renormalization group equation@xcite or envelope equation@xcite gives the evolution equation of the hydrodynamical variables , i.e. , the hydrodynamic equation , after an averaging of the distribution function @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the resultant second - order relativistic hydrodynamic equation is causal and stable @xcite , the microscopic expressions for the transport coefficients coincide with those obtained by chapman - enskog method , and those of the relaxation times are different from any other previous ones but allow physically natural interpretations .",
    "their numerical values are indeed different from those by the moment method @xcite .    in reality , the qgp is not a single - component system but reactive multi - component system composed of quarks , antiquarks and gluons . then it is imperative to derive the multi - component relativistic hydrodynamic equation for a realistic description of the qgp . in this paper",
    ", we apply the rg method to the derivation of the second - order relativistic hydrodynamic equation for the reactive multi - component systems as an extension of ref .",
    "@xcite for the single - component system . in the reactive system",
    ", the species of the particles can be changed through the collision process in a way that the imposed conservation laws are satisfied : we restrict the collision to be a 2 to 2 process for simplicity .",
    "we prove that the positive definiteness of the entropy production rate and the onsager s reciprocal relation are readily satisfied by using our microscopic expressions of the transport coefficients .",
    "furthermore , we show the causality and stability of the resultant equation in ref .  @xcite .",
    "all these confirmation strongly suggest our formulation based on the rg method .    historically , prakash et al .",
    "@xcite first derived the second - order hydrodynamics for relativistic gas mixture as an extension of the israel - stewart equation and investigated the properties of hot hadronic matter .",
    "then , there have been some attempts to derive the hydrodynamics for a mixture @xcite . among them , the work by monnai and hirano @xcite is of great importance in our point of view : they improved the israel - stewart s fourteen moment method by additionaly imposing two physically natural conditions , i.e. , the positive - definiteness of the entropy production rate and the onsager s reciprocal relation for the transport coefficients to determine the functional form for the distribution function together with a careful order counting with respect to the knudsen number .",
    "thus they arrived at a multi - component relativistic hydrodynamic equation , which happens to have the same form as that of ours to be given in the present paper .",
    "it may imply that the form of the multi - component relativistic hydrodynamic equation has been uniquely determined provided that the equation should satisfy the positivity of the entropy production rate and the reciprocal relations , irrespective of the microscopic forms of the transport coefficients .",
