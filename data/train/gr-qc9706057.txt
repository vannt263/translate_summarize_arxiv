    "wilson , mathews , and maronetti @xcite have carried out fully relativistic numerical simulations of the radiation - reaction - induced inspiral of a binary neutron star system . to make their computations tractable",
    ", they employed several approximations of ill - understood accuracy .",
    "the stars in their simulations were identical and were near the maximum allowed mass for an isolated neutron star . correspondingly , when the stars were far apart in their orbit , each was stable against gravitational collapse . surprisingly , as the stars spiraled inward , the simulations indicated that their gravitational interaction destabilized them , triggering them to collapse before their inspiral ended .",
    "the magnitude of the destabilization and mathematical arguments to explain it @xcite suggest that it should show up in the first post - newtonian approximation to general relativity .",
    "several researchers have argued that this surprising destabilization is wrong : lai @xcite has shown that tidal interactions between two nearly newtonian stars will tend to stabilize them against gravitational collapse , not destabilize them .",
    "lai s stabilization effect is formally of newtonian origin , but because of the compactness of neutron stars , its magnitude is of much higher post - newtonian order .",
    "wiseman @xcite has elucidated lai s conclusion by showing that at first post - newtonian magnitude , the stars gravitational interactions do not alter their individual central densities ; and brady and hughes @xcite have shown the same at first order in the mass ratio @xmath5 when the two stars are fully relativistic and one is much less massive than the other , @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite have carried out numerical simulations of the fully relativistic equilibrium states of a binary neutron star system in synchronous , circular orbit  simulations analogous to those of wilson , mathews , and maronetti .",
    "not only do these simulations show no sign of interaction - induced collapse ; when combined with `` turning - point '' criteria for secular stability , they actually reveal a stabilization of the stars .    on the basis of these analyses , it seems likely that the destabilization seen by wilson , mathews and maronetti does not occur in reality , but",
    "instead is an artifact of poor - accuracy approximations or is due to some error in their computations .    in this paper",
    "we present another analysis that reveals stabilization , not destabilization .",
    "our justification for yet another paper on this subject is two - fold : _ first _ , our analysis has broader validity than previous ones ",
    "it is fully relativistic , not post - newtonian ; and unlike the two previous fully relativistic analyses of stability @xcite , it is fully analytic and not based on numerical simulations , it permits the stars to rotate with arbitrary angular velocity ( though with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum ) , and it allows an arbitrary mass ratio .",
    "_ second _ , our analysis employs an unusual approach , which may be useful for other problems in fully relativistic binary evolution : it is formulated in the local asymptotic rest frame of one of the two stars and employs energy and angular momentum arguments that relate to that star alone and not to the binary system as a whole .",
    "although this approach is unusual within general relativity , it is well known in newtonian and post - newtonian theory .",
    "it , in fact , is a relativistic generalization of lai s @xcite post - newtonian proof of stabilization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we treat an idealized problem that illustrates our method : the stabilization of a non - spinning neutron star placed in a non - rotating external tidal gravitational field . then in sec .",
    "iii we generalize to a spinning star and rotating tidal field , and as an application we deduce the _ secular _ stabilization of a spinning neutron star in an inspiraling binary . in sec .",
    "iv we argue from this secular stabilization result that , if an inspiraling binary s neutron stars are secularly stable at large orbital radii , then they can not be _ dynamically _ destabilized during the inspiral ; and we make some concluding remarks . in an appendix",
    "we elucidate the influence of tidal interactions on energy conservation , in the newtonian limit .",
    "the relativistic version of this issue is a central aspect of the proof of stability given in the body of the paper .    throughout",
    "we use geometrized units in which the speed of light and newton s gravitation constant are unity .",
    "consider a family of nonrotating , spherical neutron stars characterized by a one - parameter equation of state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is pressure and @xmath9 is density of total mass - energy .",
    "we shall refer to these stars as _ equilibrium configurations _ and shall denote their masses ( as measured by the keplerian orbits of distant planets ) by @xmath10 , their total number of baryons by @xmath11 , and their radii ( defined as circumference@xmath12 ) by @xmath13 .",
    "the mass - radius relation @xmath14 of these equilibrium configurations has the qualitative form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mere ] , and @xmath15 has a similar shape ; cf .  refs .",
    "@xcite .    as is well known , the equilibrium configuration of maximum mass ( solid dot in fig .  [",
    "fig : mere ] ; `` _ critical configuration _ '' ; mass @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 ) is secularly marginally stable : it possesses a zero - frequency mode of expansion ( or contraction ) that takes it horizontally in the figure to another equilibrium configuration with the same mass .",
    "equilibria on the larger - radius side of the critical configuration are secularly stable ; those on the lower - radius side are secularly unstable @xcite .    by _ secular _",
    "is meant a mode of stellar deformation which is slow enough for pycnonuclear reactions ( pressure - induced nuclear reactions ) to keep its matter always at the endpoint of nuclear evolution , so the pressure and density changes experienced by the stellar matter follow the same equation of state @xmath18 as characterizes the equilibrium configuration itself .",
    "the slowest of the pycnonuclear reactions are `` modified urca reactions '' ( essentially @xmath19 and inverse-@xmath19 decays ) , driven as the star deforms by the rising or falling fermi energies of the star s electrons , protons , and neutrons ; they can require timescales of minutes or longer to equilibrate near and below nuclear densities , so in principle the stellar deformations can be secular only on timescales longer than this .",
    "( in practice , these slow reactions have only a weak effect on the equation of state near and above nuclear densities , so their slowness is often ignored for near critical neutron stars . )",
    "faster ( _ dynamical _ ) motions , in which some of the pycnonuclear reactions do not go to completion , will be characterized by a stiffer equation of state ( higher adiabatic index ) than secular motions and thus will be more stable . correspondingly , all equilibria on the large-@xmath13 branch , being secularly stable , must also be dynamically stable , as must be the critical configuration itself .",
    "for an ancient , further discussion of these issues but in different language , see ref .",
    "@xcite    in the next subsection we shall study the influence of an external tidal field on the secular stability of configurations that are nearly critical ( nearly at the maximum of the mass - radius curve ) . as an aid in that study , it will be useful to consider momentarily static , spherical stars that are deformed slightly away from equilibrium . for a star containing @xmath20 baryons ( with @xmath20 very nearly equal to @xmath21 ) , we obtain such a non - equilibrium configuration as follows : begin with the equilibrium configuration that has @xmath22 and radius @xmath23 .",
    "expand it or contract it slightly to the desired new radius @xmath2 . in this deformation",
    ", displace each fluid element by an amount proportional to the equilibrium configuration s fundamental - mode eigenfunction @xmath24 of secular vibration , and then remove all kinetic energy of deformation .",
    "the resulting deformed configuration will have a mass @xmath25 that differs slightly from the equilibrium mass @xmath26 .    in practice",
    ", the mass of the deformed star can be computed using not the star s true eigenfunction , but rather the eigenfunction @xmath27 of the zero - frequency mode of the critical configuration .",
    "this is because the mass is an extremum with respect to deformations of the star @xcite ; the two eigenfunctions @xmath28 and @xmath29 differ by fractional amounts of order @xmath30 , so the masses of the configurations obtained by deformations to radius @xmath2 via the @xmath28 motion and the @xmath29 motion will differ by a fractional amount of order @xmath31  which is never of interest in this paper .",
    "the configurations obtained by the above construction are characterized by two parameters , @xmath32 ; and their masses are functions of these parameters , @xmath25 .    for ease of analysis , we shall now convert to dimensionless variables : @xmath33 these variables characterize a configuration s fractional deviations from the critical configuration .",
    "figure [ fig : mnr ] shows the dimensionless mass - radius relation @xmath34 for configurations with fixed baryon number @xmath35 ( dashed curves ) , along with the equilibrium configurations ( solid curve ) . because the equilibria on the positive-@xmath36 branch are stable against secular deformations ( with eigenfunction @xmath28 ) , they lie at minima of the dashed curves ; because those on the negative-@xmath36 branch are unstable , they lie at maxima of the dashed curves .",
    "these dashed curves , when expressed as a power series , have the following form : @xmath37 where higher - order terms are of no importance in this paper , and where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are all positive .",
    "this form is dictated by the demand that for @xmath41 the dashed curve be flat at @xmath42 , and that for @xmath43 the positive-@xmath36 branch have a minimum ( stable equilibrium ) and the negative-@xmath36 branch have a maximum ( unstable ) , and that for @xmath44 there be no equilibria at all ( no extrema of the dashed curves ) .",
    "the equilibrium configurations are located at the extrema of these mass - radius curves , i.e.  at locations where @xmath45 , which yields the following equilibrium relations : @xmath46 where the upper sign is for the right branch ( stable stars ; lower mass at fixed @xmath47 ) and the lower sign , for the left branch ( unstable stars ; higher mass at fixed @xmath47 ) .",

    "we now place a near - critical neutron star in a static , external tidal gravitational field , which we characterize by the space - time - space - time components of its riemann tensor , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this tidal field will deform the star , i.e.will gravitationally `` polarize '' it , giving it a gravitational mass quadrupole moment @xmath57 .",
    "the tidal field @xmath58 , quadrupole moment @xmath57 , and total stellar mass @xmath59 ( including the deformation energy and the energy of interaction between the deformation and the tidal field ) all show up as coefficients in a power series expansion of the spacetime metric in the star s _ local asymptotic rest frame _ @xcite .",
    "for example , in harmonic ( dedonder ) coordinates that are attached to the star s center of mass , the time - time metric component has the form @xcite @xmath60 where the first `` @xmath61 '' denotes higher - order terms in @xmath62 and the second `` @xmath61 '' denotes higher - order terms in @xmath36 . here , and only here , @xmath36 is coordinate radius computed as though the spatial coordinates @xmath63 were precisely cartesian ( elsewhere in this paper @xmath64 is the star s dimensionless radius ) ; and @xmath65 is the `` unit radial vector '' . the local asymptotic rest frame , where the expansion ( [ eq : acmc ] ) is valid , is the region from the neutron star s surface out to a distance where the external tidal field can no longer be regarded as uniform .    for simplicity , and in accord with the case of a tidal field produced by a distant binary companion , we shall assume that the tidal field is axisymmetric ; and we shall choose our ( nearly cartesian ) harmonic coordinates so its symmetry axis is along the @xmath66 direction .",
    "then the induced quadrupole moment also possesses this symmetry , and the components of the tidal field and quadrupole moment take the form @xmath67 here the signs",
    "are chosen such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are both positive .    in the next few paragraphs , culminating with eq .",
    "( [ eq : qe ] ) , we shall compute the magnitude @xmath1 of the quadrupole moment that is induced by a given tidal field @xmath68 .",
    "we do so by the following thought experiment : begin with a near critical , spherical configuration of mass @xmath70 , baryon number @xmath20 , and radius @xmath2 , and turn on the tidal field @xmath71 without letting the star deform . then allow the star to deform of its own accord , in response to the fixed tidal field @xmath71 .",

    "some portion @xmath77 of the work @xmath78 goes into producing the stellar deformation ( pushing mass up in the polar regions and down in the equatorial regions ) ; the rest goes into kinetic energy of quadrupolar vibrations .",
    "suppose that we extract the kinetic energy ; then the star will settle down into the deformed configuration that has released the most kinetic energy , i.e.  the configuration that minimizes the _ potential energy function _ @xmath79",

    "as the near critical star changes its radius @xmath2 slowly and secularly at fixed tidal field @xmath71 , its quadrupole moment continually equilibrates , with an accompanying tidal feeding of energy @xmath78 into and out of the star .",
    "these radial motions conserve the star s relativistic kinetic energy plus its potential energy @xmath115 [ which includes a correction for the flow of @xmath78 ; cf .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) ] . correspondingly , the star s equilibria are the extrema of @xmath115or equivalently of its dimensionless version @xmath116and these equilibria are stable if they minimize @xmath117 and unstable if they maximize it .    by differentiating eq .",

    "not surprisingly , this leads to a secular stabilization of the star : whereas before the tidal field was turned on , the maximum number of baryons that the star could support without collapsing was @xmath21 , afterward the maximum baryon number has increased by a fractional amount @xmath125    the tidally induced increase of equilibrium radius ( [ eq : re ] ) and increase of maximum baryon number ( [ eq : nemax ] ) are the same in sign and order of magnitude as lai has deduced previously using post - newtonian arguments @xcite .    the inability of fully relativistic gravity to produce a secular instability can be traced to the robustly positive sign of the coefficient @xmath126 , which in turn follows from the fact that the star s deformation energy at fixed quadrupole moment , @xmath127 is a decreasing function of radius .",
    "it is very hard to imagine any neutron star for which this would fail to be true .",
    "we now turn attention to a rigidly rotating neutron star interacting with a rotating external tidal field , such as those which occur in binary neutron star systems . in our analysis ,",
    "the rotation is with respect to the star s local asymptotic rest frame , which itself will generally rotate with respect to `` infinity '' due to dragging of inertial frames by the binary s total angular momentum .    for simplicity",

    "for such stars , because @xmath128 is fixed once and for all , the equilibrium configurations form a one - parameter family analogous to that for static stars .",
    "we shall characterize those equilibria by their masses @xmath10 ( as measured by keplerian orbits in their local asymptotic rest frames ) , their number of baryons @xmath11 , and their equatorial radii @xmath13 ( defined as their equatorial circumferences@xmath12 ) .",
    "these equilibria will have a mass - radius relation @xmath14 with the same general shape as that for nonrotating stars ( fig .",

    "the motions of interest are _ secular _ in two senses : ( i ) as for static stars , the motions must be slow enough for pycnonuclear reactions to go to completion so each element of expanding and contracting stellar material follows the same equation of state @xmath18 as characterizes the equilibrium stellar structure .",
    "( ii ) the motions must also be slow enough for viscosity to produce enough coupling between adjacent mass elements to keep the star rigidly rotating .",
    "this second condition is especially severe ; so in practice the secular stabilization that we shall prove is of interest primarily because of its implications for dynamical stability ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] ) .    as for static stars ,",
    "we construct from our one - parameter rigidly rotating family of equilibria a two - parameter family of configurations that are expanded and contracted away from equilibrium .",
    "our construction procedure is precisely the same as in the static case , with the slow , fundamental secular mode of deformation governing the expansions and contractions .",
    "the resulting deformed configurations will obviously have mass - radius curves , @xmath25 at fixed @xmath20 ( and forever fixed @xmath128 ) , with the same general shapes as in the static case : the dashed curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : mnr ] . moreover , when expressed in dimensionless variables ( [ eq : dimensionless ] ) , the @xmath34 relation near the critical point for our rotating family will have the same mathematical form , @xmath129 , as for the static case .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 will be affected by the rotation and thus will not take on their static forms ( [ eq : coefficients ] ) , but in order to produce the equilibria s known stability properties , they will still all be positive .",
    "we now place each of our rigidly rotating , near - critical stars ",
    "all with the same spin angular momentum @xmath128in a rotating , external tidal gravitational field .",
    "we assume that the star and the tidal field rotate about the same axis as seen in the star s local asymptotic rest frame ; the star s rotational angular velocity is @xmath130/s , and if the rotating field is produced by a binary companion , its angular velocity is that of the orbital motion , @xmath131/s @xcite . in this case , the tidal field is exceedingly unlikely to excite the star s normal modes significantly .",
    "this is because ( i ) significant excitation requires resonant coupling ; ( ii ) the circularly polarized @xmath72- and @xmath132-modes have angular velocities of pattern rotation @xmath133/s ( unless the star is rotating close to centrifugal breakup ) , which is too large to resonate with the driving force except under the most extreme of circumstances ; and ( iii ) the low - frequency @xmath73-modes , which _ can _ resonate , have only very weak coupling to the tidal field @xcite . with this justification",
    ", we shall assume that the tidal field does not resonantly excite the star s normal modes .",
    "the rotating tidal field will , however , raise a nonresonant , rotating quadrupolar tide on the neutron star .",
    "if the star s material had zero viscosity , the tide would be perfectly aligned with the tidal field ; i.e. , the axes of the star s rotating quadrupole moment @xmath57 would be identical to those of the tidal field @xmath134 .",
    "this standard newtonian result must be true also in general relativity since the relevant physics is nothing but that of simple harmonic oscillators : whenever an undamped oscillator is driven by an off - resonance sinusoidal force , the oscillator s displacement response is precisely in phase with the force . as for an oscillator , so for the star , any small viscosity will cause a slight phase lag between excitation and response : the orientation of the star s tidal deformation and its quadrupole moment will lag that of the tidal field by an angle @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the viscous damping time for the star s quadrupolar excitations .",
    "for realistic viscosities , this is an exceedingly small lag angle @xcite ; so the quadrupole moment is very nearly oriented along the tidal field .",
    "this agreement of orientations prevents the tidal field from torquing the star , so the star s spin angular momentum @xmath128 is conserved .",
    "this conservation of @xmath128 and alignment of tidal field and quadrupole moment enable us to carry over the static - star analysis of tidal stabilization ( sec .",
    "[ sec : statictidal ] ) to the rotating case , essentially without change .",

    "( [ eq : llint ] ) , and that integration must give expression ( [ eq : mqe ] ) aside from a multiplicative factor that is close to unity . this multiplicative factor ( call it @xmath139 ) , which we have not computed , will arise from the synchronous rotation of the tide and star with velocity @xmath140 at the star s surface .",
    "it can not differ from unity by more than @xmath141 ( there is no linear term @xmath142 because such a term would reverse sign when the star reverses direction of rotation . ) as in the static case , the quadrupole moment adjusts itself so as to minimize the potential energy function @xmath143 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) ; the resulting @xmath144 is expression ( [ eq : qe ] ) aside from the multiplicative factor @xmath145 ; and the star s radius changes slowly and secularly in a manner governed by the potential energy function @xmath146 [ eq .",

    "the only difference is in the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath147 , and @xmath126 .    as in the static case ,",
    "the key to tidal stabilization is the sign of @xmath126 ; and as there , so long as the star s deformation energy at fixed quadrupole moment , @xmath148 $ ] is a decreasing function of radius @xmath2 , the tidal field secularly stabilizes the star , increases its radius , and decreases its central density .",
    "it is exceedingly difficult to imagine a star for which ( when @xmath149s as it must be in an inspiraling binary @xcite ) this would not be the case .",
    "in this paper we have proved that tidal fields tend to stabilize a star against secular gravitational collapse . however , for spinning stars in binaries , secular stability is irrelevant because radiation reaction drives the binary through the regime of relativistic gravity far too quickly for viscosity to keep the rotation rigid in pulsational motions .",
    "the relevant issue in this case is dynamical stability .    as is well known ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , secular stability implies dynamical stability .",
    "this is so for two reasons .",
    "first , pycnonuclear reactions go to completion in secular motions but not in dynamical motions , and as a result the secular motions are characterized by a softer equation of state than the dynamical motions and thus are less stable .",
    "second , dynamical motions of an initially rigidly rotating star produce differential rotation ; and the viscous coupling that converts that differential rotation into the rigid rotation of a secular motion will necessarily extract energy from the rotation .",
    "this means that , beginning with the same equilibrium configuration , the dynamical motion must lead to a configuration of greater potential energy @xmath150 than the secular motion , which in turn means that the equilibrium configuration is more stable against the dynamical motion than against the secular motion .",
    "consider a rigidly rotating neutron star in the final , relativistic phase of binary inspiral . such a star must have lived for millions of years to reach this inspiral phase , so it must be secularly stable as well as dynamically stable before the tidal field of its companion begins to affect it significantly .",
    "the growing tidal field , as we have seen , must increase the star s secular stability .",
    "since secular stability implies dynamical stability , the tidally deformed star must also remain dynamically stable .",
    "this conclusion is not at all obvious from the equations of the post - newtonian approximation , as they are usually written : in a reference frame that is asymptotically inertial at infinity .",
    "one can identify in those equations terms that appear able to produce tidal instability at first post - newtonian order @xcite .",
    "this fact illustrates the superficially misleading character of the post - newtonian equations : apparently magical cancellations @xcite enforce the strong equivalence principle , which is fundamentally at the heart of tidal stabilization .",
    "by contrast , the mathematical tools used in this paper , being based on the local asymptotic rest frame of the star whose stability interests us , are closely linked to the strong equivalence principle and lead rather directly to the tidal stabilization .",
    "these tools are not widely used in relativistic astrophysics .",
    "they are worth trying whenever one is interested in the behavior of a semi - isolated portion of a larger relativistic system  e.g . , a neutron star or black hole interacting with other bodies @xcite .",
    "as this paper was being completed , i learned of a similar , local - asymptotic - rest - frame analysis by flanagan @xcite , which , however , focuses on equations of motion rather than energy considerations .",
