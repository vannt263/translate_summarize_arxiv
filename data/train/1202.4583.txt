    "<S> we investigate statistical properties exhibited by the squeezed states , in particular mandel s parameter , second - order correlation function , photon number distributions and parameter @xmath0 in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the quadrature and amplitude - squared squeezing effects . </S>",
