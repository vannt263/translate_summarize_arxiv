    "there are two endeavors which are studied by many physicists over and over again , and often the solutions sought for the two problems intersect .",
    "the first one is to write a theory which is shown to have a nontrivial limit , or zero for the beta function of the renormalization group for a non zero value of the coupling constant , as the renormalization cut - off goes to infinity .",
    "the perturbatively nontrivial @xmath0 theory in four dimensions was shown to go to a free theory as the cut - off was lifted a while ago @xcite .",
    "this example shows that perturbative expansions are not decisive in obtaining a nontrivial model .",
    "there is continuing research on this subject @xcite .",
    "the other ongoing endeavor is to use only fermions to build a model of nature , where all the observed bosons are constructed as composites of these entities . in solid state physics the basic fields ,",
    "the electrons come together to form bosons to explain superconductivity @xcite .",
    "heisenberg spent years to formulate a `` theory of everything '' for particle physics , using only fermions @xcite .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , which was constructed based on an analogy with the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite , is a model which satisfies both ambitions , which is written in terms of fermions only and perturbatively non - renormalizable .",
    "this model also was shown to go to a trivial model @xcite .",
    "there are new attempts to make sense of these theories either as an effective model at low energies , which will give valuable information in qcd @xcite , for example for the studies of hadron mass generation through spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "another attempt is gauging the model and investigating whether the new coupling gives rise to a nontrivial theory @xcite .",
    "these examples show that the search for non - trivial models using only fermions may be an interesting endeavor .",
    "another attempt in writing a model using only fermions came with the work of g \" ursey , @xcite . here a non - polynomial but conformal invariant lagrangian was written to describe self - interacting fermions with the intention of remedying some of the problems of the heisenberg model @xcite . to be able to write a conformally invariant lagrangian , grsey had to use a non - polynomial form .",
    "kortel found solutions to this conformal invariant theory @xcite which were shown to be instantons and merons much later @xcite .",
    "one of us , with collaborators , tried to make quantum sense of this model a while ago @xcite , finding that even if these attempts were justified , this model went to a trivial model as the cut - off is removed .",
    "several processes were calculated @xcite involving incoming and outgoing spinors which gave exactly the naive quark model results , missing the observed logarithmic behavior predicted by qcd calculations .",
    "we tried to give a new interpretation of our old work in @xcite . in that work",
    "we saw that the polynomial form of the original model really did not correspond to the original g \" ursey model in the exact sense .",
    "the two versions obey different symmetries .",
    "this was shown explicitly in reference @xcite .",
    "we went to higher orders in the calculation , beyond one loop for scattering processes . by using the dyson - schwinger and bethe - salpeter equations we could calculate higher order processes .",
    "we saw that while the non - trivial scattering of the fundamental fields was not allowed , bound states could scatter from each other with non - trivial amplitudes .",
    "the essential point in our analysis was the fact that , being proportional to @xmath1 , the composite scalar field propagator cancelled many of the potential infinities that arise while calculating loop integrals . as a result of this cancellation , only composite fields participate in physical processes such as scattering and particle production . the scattering and production of elementary spinor fields were not allowed .",
    "this phenomena was an example of treating the bound states , instead of the principal fields , as physical entities .",
    "a further point will be to couple an elementary vector field to the model described in reference @xcite , in line with the process studied for the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "coupling the same elementary field to the model described in reference @xcite will be similar , giving a model with two vector fields , one composite , the other one elementary .",
    "our final goal is to investigate if we get a non - trivial theory when we couple a yang - mills system with color and flavor degrees of freedom , like it is done in @xcite .",
    "here we study the abelian case , as an initial step .    in this note",
    "we summarize the changes in our results when this elementary vector field is coupled to the model described in reference @xcite .",
    "we outline the model as is given in refs . @xcite and @xcite in next section and give our new results in subsequent sections .",
    "the main conclusion is that our original model , in which only the composites take part in physical processes like scattering or particle production , is reduced to a gauged  higgs - yukawa model , where both the composites and the fundamental spinor and vector fields participate in all the processes .",
    "our initial model is given by the lagrangian    @xmath2    here the only terms with kinetic part are the spinors .",
    "@xmath3 is a lagrange multiplier field , @xmath4 is a scalar field with no kinetic part , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are coupling constants .",
    "this expression contains two constraint equations , obtained from writing the euler - lagrange equations for the @xmath3 and @xmath7 fields .",
    "hence , it should be quantized using the dirac constraint analysis as performed in reference @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian given above is just an attempt in writing the original g \" ursey lagrangian    @xmath8    in a polynomial form .",
    "we see that the @xmath9 invariance of the original grsey lagrangian is retained in the form written in equation ( [ cl ] ) .",
    "this discrete symmetry prevents @xmath10 from acquiring a finite mass in higher orders .",
    "we also see that the two models given by lagrangians in equations ( [ cl ] ) and ( [ gl ] ) are not equivalent since the former does not obey one extra symmetry obeyed by the latter one .",
    "this was carefully studied in reference @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , take the first model as a model which only approximates the original grsey model , without claiming equivalence and study only that model in this work .",
    "to quantize the latter system consistently we proceed via the path integral method .",
    "this procedure was carried out in reference @xcite . at the end of these calculations we found out that we can write the constrained lagrangian given in equation ( [ cl ] ) as    @xmath11\\psi-{{a}\\over{16}}(\\phi^{4}+2\\phi^{3}\\xi-2\\phi\\xi^{3}- \\xi^{4})+{i\\over{4}}c^*(\\phi^{2}+2\\phi\\xi+\\xi^{2 } )",

    "the fermion propagator is the usual dirac propagator in lowest order , as can be seen from the lagrangian . after integrating over the fermion fields in the path integral",
    ", we obtain the effective action .",
    "the second derivative of the effective action with respect to the @xmath12 field gives us the induced inverse propagator for the @xmath12 field , with the infinite part given as    @xmath16=   { { g^2   q^2}\\over { 8\\pi^{2 } \\epsilon}}.\\ ] ]    here dimensional regularization is used for the momentum integral and @xmath17 .",
    "we see that the @xmath12 field propagates as a massless field .",
    "when we study the propagators for the other fields , we see that no linear or quadratic term in @xmath13 exists , so the one loop contribution to the @xmath13 propagator is absent",
    ". similarly the mixed derivatives of the effective action with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath12 are zero at one loop , so no mixing between these two fields occurs .",
    "we can also set the propagators of the ghost fields to zero , since they give no contribution in the one loop approximation .",
    "the higher loop contributions are absent for these fields .    in reference",
    "@xcite we also studied the contributions to the fermion propagator at higher orders and we found , by studying the dyson - schwinger equations for the two point function , that there were no new contributions .",
    "we had at least one phase where the mass of the spinor field was zero .    in reference",
    "@xcite we studied a similar model where the composite vector field replaced the composite scalar field , with similar results .",
    "here we couple an elementary vector field to the model described in reference @xcite , in a minimal way , with a new coupling constant @xmath18 , acting in accordance of the work in references @xcite .",
    "the new lagrangian is given as    @xmath19 \\psi - { { a } \\over{4 } } ( \\phi^4 + 2\\phi^3 \\xi-2\\xi^3 \\phi-\\xi^4)\\nonu \\\\ + { { i}\\over{4 } } c^*(\\xi^2 + 2\\phi \\xi + \\phi^2 ) c-{{1}\\over{4 } } f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu } -{\\overline{\\psi}}e a\\!\\!\\!/\\psi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath20 is the elementary vector field and @xmath21 is defined from @xmath20 in the usual way .",

    "if our fermion field had a color index @xmath22 where @xmath23 , we could perform an 1/n expansion to justify the use of only ladder diagrams for higher orders for the scattering processes .",
