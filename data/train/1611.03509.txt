    "solar - type stars show a saturated relationship between rotation and chromospheric or coronal activity : with rotation above a certain threshold , activity maintains a constant value , while at slower spins activity and rotation are correlated .",
    "this has been demonstrated using coronal ( x - ray ) emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , chromospheric ( h@xmath0 and ca ii ) emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and radio emission from accelerated electrons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "coronal and chromospheric emission typically result from magnetic heating of the stellar atmosphere , while radio emission is a more direct probe of the magnetic field .",
    "the rotation ",
    "activity relation is therefore interpreted as resulting from the underlying magnetic dynamo . for solar - type stars ,",
    "this is generally thought to be the @xmath3 dynamo , a product of differential rotation winding up the poloidal magnetic field ( the @xmath4 effect ) and subsequent twisting of the now - toroidal magnetic field ( the @xmath0 effect ) . in the interface @xmath3 dynamo , these processes occur at the tachocline , the boundary between the convective and radiative zones .",
    "rotational evolution is also influenced by the magnetic field , due to the coupling of the stellar wind to the magnetic field .    moving across",
    "the m dwarf spectral class , the convective envelope extends deeper into the stellar interior , with theoretical models indicating that stars become fully convective for masses @xmath5 @xmath1  @xcite . in stars lacking a tachocline ,",
    "the interface @xmath3 can not be at play and the mechanisms for generating large - scale magnetic fields in fully - convective stars are not well understood .",
    "nevertheless , zeeman doppler imaging reveals that some do indeed have large - scale fields @xcite , and many mid - to - late m - dwarfs have strong signatures of magnetic activity , with emission from the x - ray to the radio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the expected difference in magnetic dynamo , the strong connection between rotation and magnetic activity persists in m dwarfs .",
    "consistent with that seen in more massive stars , the rotation - activity relation in m dwarfs is saturated for rapid rotators , and declines with decreasing rotational velocity @xcite .",
    "this is seen in a wide variety of tracers of magnetic activity , including x - ray flux @xcite , ca h&k , @xcite , h@xmath0 emission @xcite , and global magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "the magnetic activity lifetime of low - mass stars is mass - dependent , with spin - down interpreted as the causative factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "until recently , activity studies for low - mass stars have necessarily had to rely on  measurements of rotation rates , which can be obtained only for the most rapidly rotating m dwarfs .",
    "the typical  survey has a detection threshold of around @xmath6 km / s , which for a @xmath7 @xmath8  star corresponds to a rotation period of only @xmath9 days .",
    "the saturated regime of the rotation ",
    "activity relation is seen in stars with detectable rotational broadening , while those without broadening show a range of activity levels .",
    "photometric rotation period measurements , which can probe longer periods , are therefore key to studying the late stages of rotational evolution of low mass stars and the unsaturated rotation  activity relation .",
    "the mearth project is a transiting planet survey looking for super earths around 3000 mid - to - late m dwarfs within 33pc @xcite . from the mearth data , we have identified @xmath10 stars in the northern hemisphere with photometric rotation periods @xcite .",
    "our observations often span 6 months or longer , providing excellent sensitivity to long periods @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured h@xmath0 emission for @xmath11 m dwarfs with preliminary rotation periods from mearth .",
    "they found that both the fraction of stars that are active and the strength of magnetic activity declines with increasing rotation period for early m dwarfs .",
    "late m dwarfs were found to remain magnetically active out to longer rotation periods , before both the active fraction and activity level diminished abruptly . in this work , we harness the full mearth rotation period sample , new optical spectra , and a compilation of measurements from the literature to undertake an in - depth study of magnetic activity in nearby m dwarfs .",
    "our sample of m dwarfs is drawn from the mearth project , an all - sky survey looking for transiting planets around approximately 3000 nearby , mid - to - late m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite selected the northern mearth targets from the @xcite northern proper motion catalog 1(hereafter the `` nearby northern m dwarf '' sample ) .",
    "the sample is composed of all stars with proper motions @xmath12 , and parallaxes or distance estimates ( spectroscopic or photometric ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) placing them within 33 pc . the target list for the mearth transit survey additionally is limited to stars with estimated stellar radii @xmath13 @xmath8 , 1but in this work we consider all stars in the nearby northern m dwarf sample .",
    "note that in the years since our nearby northern m dwarf sample was defined , trigonometric parallaxes have been published for many of these stars , sometimes resulting in revised distances greater than , or estimating radii larger than , 1the limits originally placed on the sample @xcite .",
    "thus , stars more massive and more distant than originally intended are included in the nearby northern m dwarf sample .",

    "<S> although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate large - scale magnetic fields are not well understood , it is clear that , as for solar - type stars , stellar rotation plays a pivotal role . </S>",

    "<S> stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.6 @xmath1  are well - represented in our sample , with fast and slow rotators of all masses . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a threshold in the mass  period plane that separates active and inactive m dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold coincides with the fast - period edge of the slowly rotating population , at approximately the rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease . </S>",
    "<S> the well - defined active / inactive boundary indicates that h@xmath0 activity is a useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period , e.g.  for target selection for exoplanet surveys , and we present a mass - period relation for inactive m dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a significant , moderate correlation between  and variability amplitude : more active stars display higher levels of photometric variability . </S>",
