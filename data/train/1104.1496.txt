    "measure - valued processes arise naturally as infinite system limits of empirical measures of finite particle systems .",
    "a number of approaches have been developed which preserve distinct particles in the limit and which give a representation of the measure - valued process as a transformation of the limiting infinite particle system .",
    "most of these representations @xcite have exploited properties of exchangeable sequences , identifying the state of the measure - valued process as a multiple of the de finetti measure of the sequence , or , as in @xcite , as a transformation of the de finetti measure of a sequence that gives both a location and a mass for the distinct particles .",
    "the primary limitation of the representations given for measure - valued branching processes in @xcite is that the branching rates must be independent of particle location .",
    "this restriction was relaxed in @xcite for critical and subcritical branching , but that representation does not seem to provide much useful insight and would be difficult to extend to supercritical processes .",
    "a second limitation of the approach in @xcite is that , at least without major additional effort , it applies only to models in which the states are finite measures .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give another construction which , although similar to that of @xcite , applies immediately to both subcritical and supercritical processes ( as well as processes that are subcritical in some locations and supercritical in others ) .",
    "the construction also applies immediately to models with infinite mass . in addition , the new construction seems to be a much more effective tool for analyzing the measure - valued processes obtained .",
    "we introduce the basic ideas of the construction in section [ simpex ] , giving results for population models without location or type . as in the earlier work ,",
    "the justification for the representation is a consequence of a markov mapping theorem , theorem  [ mf ] .",
    "the feller diffusion approximation for nearly critical branching processes is obtained as a consequence of the construction .",
    "section [ sectpois ] gives the construction for the general branching markov process and the dawson ",
    "watanabe superprocess limit .",
    "section [ secteg ] gives a variety of applications and extensions , including conditioning on nonextinction , models with heavy - tailed offspring distributions and processes in random environments .",
    "the contains background material and a number of technical lemmas .",
    "in this section , we give particle representations for pure death and continuous time markov branching processes and illustrate how the infinite system limit can be derived immediately .",
    "the main point is to introduce the notion of the _ level _ of a particle in the simplest possible settings .      for @xmath6 ,",
    "let @xmath7 be independent random variables , uniformly distributed on @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath8 , let @xmath9 so @xmath10 , and define @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where the @xmath13 are the values of the @xmath14 that are less than @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath15 will be referred to as the levels of the particles .",
    "the level of a particle being below @xmath0 means that the particle is `` alive , '' and as soon as its level reaches @xmath0 the particle `` dies . ''",
    "note that @xmath16 is the number of particles `` alive '' in the system at time @xmath1 .",

    "then trivially , @xmath39 is an @xmath40-martingale , and lemma [ mglem ] implies @xmath41-\\int_0^te[af(u(s),n(s))|\\mathcal{f}^n_s ] \\,ds\\\\ & & \\qquad=\\widehat{f}(n(t))-\\int_0^tc\\widehat{f}(n(s))\\,ds\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a @xmath42-martingale .",
    "consequently , @xmath43 is a solution of the martingale problem for @xmath44 and hence is a linear death process .",
    "of course , this observation follows immediately from the fact that @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath47 , but the martingale argument illustrates a procedure that works much more generally .      for @xmath48 and @xmath19 as above , @xmath49 , @xmath6 and @xmath50 , define the generator @xmath51\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } + f(u , n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(au_i^2-bu_i)\\frac{g'(u_i)}{g(u_i)}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we refer to @xmath52 as the _ level _ of the @xmath29th particle , and as in the pure death example , a  particle `` dies '' when its level reaches @xmath0 .",
    "the process with generator ( [ lbgen ] ) has the following properties .",
    "the particle levels satisfy @xmath53 and a particle with level @xmath54 gives birth at rate @xmath55 to a particle whose initial level is uniformly distributed between @xmath54 and @xmath0 .",
    "uniqueness for the martingale problems for @xmath56 follows by first checking uniqueness for the operator @xmath57 given by the second term alone , and then showing that uniqueness holds up to the first time that the process includes @xmath22 particles by observing that @xmath56 truncated at @xmath22 is a bounded perturbation of @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the first hitting time of @xmath22 goes to infinity as @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "problem 28 in section 4.11 of @xcite ) .    as before , @xmath32 .",
    "to calculate @xmath59 , observe that @xmath60 and @xmath61 then @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the generator of a branching process .",

    "uniqueness holds for the martingale problem for @xmath74 , so for any solution of the martingale problem for @xmath74 satisfying @xmath77 , we have that @xmath78 is a solution of the martingale problem for @xmath44 .    this representation can be used to do simple calculations .",
    "for example , let @xmath79 be the minimum of @xmath80 . then for all @xmath1 ,",
    "all levels are above @xmath81 let @xmath82 . then if @xmath83 is finite , @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath85 , then @xmath86 note that the assumption that @xmath87 ensures that @xmath88 .    in the branching process , the average lifetime of an individual is @xmath89 which will be small if @xmath0 is large .",
    "consequently , it is important to note that the levels do not represent single individuals in the branching process but whole lines of descent .",
    "for example , at least in the critical or subcritical case , the individual with level @xmath79 at time zero is the individual whose line of descent lasts longer than that of any other individual alive at time zero .      if @xmath90 , then conditioning on nonextinction , that is , conditioning on @xmath91 and letting @xmath92 , is equivalent to conditioning on @xmath93 . conditioned on @xmath93 , @xmath94 include @xmath95 independent , uniform @xmath2 $ ] random variables and one that equals zero .",
    "if one of the initial levels is zero , then the solution of the martingale problems for @xmath56 gives a solution for @xmath96 and taking @xmath97 to be the distribution of @xmath22 independent random variables , one of which is zero and the others uniform @xmath2 $ ] , we see that @xmath43 is a solution of the martingale problem for @xmath98      if @xmath99 , then conditioning on extinction is equivalent to conditioning on @xmath100 . conditioned on @xmath101 , @xmath102 are independent uniform @xmath103 $ ] .",
