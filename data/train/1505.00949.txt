    "image , this feature appears to be a tidal arm looping back onto the host galaxy ; _ 3 ) . _ a southern tidal arm / tail that is most prominent in the _ nicmos _ image . in the middle of the tidal arm ( at roughly 10kpc distance from the center )",
    "there is an apparent _ nicmos _ companion that is not visible in the _ wfpc2 _ image .",

    "all these features are indicated in fig.[fig : hst ] .                  in em11 we presented the detection of co(1 - 0 ) emission in mrc0152 - 209 , with @xmath48 .",
    "figures [ fig : codistribution ] and [ fig : codistributionxz ] show the distribution of co(1 - 0 ) in mrc0152 - 209 that we derive from our new high - resolution atca observations .",
    "part of the co(1 - 0 ) emission appears to be associated with the bright optical emission of the central host galaxy ( with ` host galaxy ' defined in this paper as the region of bright optical emission that covers the double nuclear component in fig.[fig : hst ] ; i.e. region @xmath341 ) .",
    "however , a large fraction of the co(1 - 0 ) emission is clearly off - set from the host galaxy .",
    "this gas appears to coincide with several of the tidal features seen in the _ hst / wfpc2 _ and _ hst / nicmos _ imaging , namely the inner parts of the looped northern arm ( region @xmath342 ) and the southern arm / tail ( region @xmath343 ) . following @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we estimate that the astrometry of the co emission - line peak in regions 2 and 3 has an accuracy of @xmath49 , for @xmath50 and s / n @xmath1 4.5 .",
    "this confirms that part of the co(1 - 0 ) is indeed off - set by at least 20kpc from the central host galaxy .",
    "there is also a weak tail of redshifted co(1 - 0 ) that is not detected in the _ hst _ image and that stretches up to @xmath135 kpc ( 4@xmath41 ) se of the host galaxy ( region `` t '' in figs.[fig : codistribution]@xmath51[fig : mrc0152color ] ) .",
    "we argue that the co(1 - 0 ) in regions 2 , 3 and `` t '' is most likely tidal - debris of cold molecular gas that follows the tidal features visible in the _ hst _ imaging , and which is spread across a total extent of @xmath160 kpc .",
    "alternatively , some of the extended co(1 - 0 ) components may identify gas - rich merging companion galaxies .",
    "we do not favor this scenario , because no identifiable candidate galaxies are found at the location of the extended co(1 - 0 ) in the _ hst / wfpc2 _ and _ nicmos _ imaging .",
    "however , given the @xmath10.5@xmath41 uncertainty in absolute astrometry between the atca and _ hst _ data , and the presence of a possible _ hst / nicmos _ companion @xmath110kpc towards the south - east ( fig.[fig : hst ] ) , we can not completely rule out this possibility with our current data .",
    "figure[fig : mrc0152color ] shows the total intensity maps and spectra of the various co(1 - 0 ) components .",
    "we derive co luminosities of the three main components ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) from their emission - line spectra .",
    "we use this approach because the co emission from these three components is not completely mutually independent ( given that their spatial separation is on the order of one beam - size ) , and in the spectra any contribution from adjacent components can be more easily identified than in the total intensity plots ( fig.[fig : mrc0152color ] - bottom ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath52 k kms@xmath14",
    "pc@xmath19  is associated with the central host galaxy ( the `` blue '' component @xmath341 in fig[fig : mrc0152color ] ) , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 k kms@xmath14 pc@xmath19  are associated with the suggested tidal debris of the green ( @xmath342 ) and red ( @xmath343 ) component , respectively .",

    "they do not reflect the additional 30@xmath30 error in absolute flux calibration ( sect.[sec : obsco ] ) , because this is a scaling factor that affects all components in the same way . ]",
    "combined , these three components recover roughly 80@xmath30 of the total co(1 - 0 ) luminosity from the low - resolution observations of em11 ( @xmath55 k kms@xmath14 pc@xmath19 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that another 20@xmath30 of the co emission ( @xmath56 k kms@xmath14 pc@xmath19 ) is associated with even more widespread gas , such as the green extension nw of component 2 and the tentative tail towards the se .",
    "therefore , @xmath140@xmath30 of the overall co(1 - 0 ) emission in mrc0152 - 209 ( i.e. @xmath57 k kms@xmath14 pc@xmath19 ) appears to be associated with the central host galaxy , while @xmath160@xmath30 ( @xmath58 k kms@xmath14 pc@xmath19 ) is found across the widespread tidal debris .",
    "fig.[fig : mrc0152color ] also shows that the tidal co(1 - 0 ) is found at higher velocities than the co(1 - 0 ) in the central host galaxy .",
    "the 8.2ghz radio continuum source appears to be aligned with the co - emitting gas ( fig.[fig : mrc0152color ] - right ) . in particular",

    "we are currently in the process of imaging the structure of the radio source at much higher resolution with new observations .",

    "for example , the estimated starburst - ir luminosity of the dragonfly galaxy is more than 3@xmath74 that of the massive spiderweb galaxy at @xmath75 and comparable to that of 4c41.17 at @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the dragonfly galaxy is also among the most massive hzrgs known at any @xmath0 , with m@xmath77=5.8@xmath7410@xmath78 m@xmath3 @xcite .    as shown in fig.[fig : spectrum ] and table [ tab : spec ] , strong ly@xmath5  emission is detected in the dragonfly galaxy .",

    "evidence that part of the @xmath81 in the dragonfly galaxy originates from enhanced star formation comes from the high ly@xmath5/heii emission - line ratio of 25 ( table [ tab : spec ] ) . according to @xcite , a line ratio of ly@xmath5/heii@xmath8315 indicates that simple agn photo - ionisation models are no longer able to explain the ly@xmath5  content , and instead a significant fraction of the ly@xmath5  emission is ionised by enhanced star formation .  and",
    "civ lines with respect to heii can also occur from high gas densities ( @xmath841000 @xmath85 ) , but this would imply that the ly@xmath5  emission is mostly unobscured , which is not likely for the dragonfly galaxy . to confirm that enhanced star formation causes the large ly@xmath5/heii ratio ,",

    "the ly@xmath5/heii = 25 found in the dragonfly galaxy is only matched by three other hzrgs out of a sample of 54 ( 4c41.17 , pksb1243 + 036 and tnj0205 + 2242 ) , which are all three at @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the corresponding @xmath81/@xmath87 is an order of magnitude below the estimated @xmath81/@xmath88 that @xcite derive from the expected intrinsic ly@xmath5  luminosity of massive starbursts . combined with the fact that ly@xmath5  has a contribution from gas that is photoionised by the agn ,",
    "it is clear that the ly@xmath5  emission due to stellar ionisation is much fainter than expected for a system with such intense star formation .",
    "this means that the starburst in the dragonfly galaxy must be very heavily obscured .",
    "these ly@xmath5  results support that the dragonfly galaxy is an extreme @xmath89 starbursting system , in which the enhanced star formation is presumably triggered by the merger event .    when comparing the starburst ir luminosity to the co luminosity , @xmath90/@xmath91 @xmath92 300 @xmath93 ( k km / s pc@xmath94)@xmath14 for the dragonfly galaxy .",

    "the specific star formation rate of the dragonfly galaxy , ssfr = sfr / m@xmath77=5.2 gyr@xmath14 , is also comparable to the ssfr@xmath1@xmath95gyr@xmath14 estimated for smgs and high-@xmath0 dust - obscured galaxies ( dogs ) by @xcite .",
    "these estimates are higher than those obtained by cosmological simulations of smgs undergoing smooth gas accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading @xcite to conclude that the high ssfrs in these systems are driven by galaxy mergers . for the dragonfly galaxy , with sfr@xmath13000 m@xmath3yr@xmath14 and m@xmath96 , the estimated minimum gas - depletion time - scale is t@xmath97 @xmath98 myr ( assuming that the complete reservoir of cold molecular gas is efficiently converted into new stars ) .",
    "if the bulk of the star formation occurs in the central host galaxy , with m@xmath99 of cold molecular gas available , this would be t@xmath100 myr .",

    "they are also about an order of magnitude shorter than the gas depletion time - scales derived for a sample of starforming galaxies ( sfgs ) at @xmath101 @xcite , or for a similar sample of ir - selected sfgs galaxies at @xmath0@xmath12 , which dominate the ulirg - mode at high-@xmath0 through gas - accretion processes other than major mergers @xcite .",
    "this is again consistent with the interpretation that the current hylirg - phase of the dragonfly galaxy is a short period of maximum starburst activity triggered by a major gas - rich merger . as such",
    ", the dragonfly galaxy resembles the well - studied gas - rich galaxy group bri 1202 - 0725 at @xmath102 , which contains a merging dust - obscured smg and fir - hyperluminous quasar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with a separation of @xmath126 kpc between the smg and quasar in bri 1202 - 0725 , the notable difference is that the dragonfly galaxy appears in a much more advanced stage of the merger .",
    "interestingly , the minimum time - scale for the star formation to deplete the cold gas is of the same order as the expected lifetime of the radio source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this short depletion time - scale implies that @xmath51 in principle@xmath51 the star formation itself could be the dominant mechanism for clearing the central host galaxy of cold , self - gravitating molecular gas , without the explicit need for strong negative feedback from the quasar nucleus ( as often invoked for high-@xmath0 qsos ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this short and vigorous starburst episode may perhaps indicate that we are witnessing a crucial phase of transformation that will quickly turn the dragonfly galaxy into a massive high-@xmath0 quiescent elliptical ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , once most of the cold gas has been consumed .    still , despite the estimated short t@xmath103 for the current starburst event ( which is most likely",
    "concentrated towards the central host galaxy ) , it is likely that the star formation rates within the widespread tidal debris are substantially lower than 3000 m@xmath3yr@xmath14 . given that roughly 60@xmath30 of the cold molecular gas is spread on scales of this tidal debris , it is likely that part of this gas reservoir will remain intact for much longer than t@xmath103 and may trigger future , perhaps less intense , episodes of star formation , once the cold gas is re - accreted back onto the host galaxy .",
    "the dragonfly galaxy has a fairly small radio source ( 2.2@xmath41/18kpc in diameter ; @xcite ) . on scales of a few tens of kpc",
    ", there is an apparent alignment between part of the widespread co(1 - 0 ) emission and the radio - jet axis ( fig.[fig : mrc0152color ] ) .",
    "this is most notable for the co - emission nw of the host galaxy .",
    "unless this is merely a chance alignment , it suggests that there is a physical link between the propagating radio source and the widespread molecular gas .",
    "intriguing support for this scenario comes from the recent discovery of cold molecular co(1 - 0 ) reservoirs found in the halo environment of several hzrgs , with the co(1 - 0 ) emission aligned along the radio axis and found just outside the brightest edge of the radio source @xcite .",
    "the widespread co(1 - 0 ) emission in the dragonfly galaxy suggests that it may be common for cold gas and dust to be expelled as tidal debris during the early evolution of high-@xmath0 radio galaxies . as the jets expand into this cold gas and dust , on the one hand their radio flux may be boosted , which may potentially introduce a bias in identifying these systems as hzrgs @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is also likely that slow shocks will develop in the multi - phase medium , leading to compression of the atomic and molecular phases of the gas @xcite .",
    "small amounts of dust surviving in the shocked gas may catalyze the formation of molecules .",
    "the cooling provided by ( predominately ) h@xmath104 may lead to large quantities of cold molecular gas @xcite , as observed along the radio jets of several hzrgs @xcite .",
    "thus , the tidal stripping of gas and dust during a galaxy merger may possibly play a key role in enabling the formation of cold molecular gas along the radio jet as it expands .",
    "potentially , this scenario may even trigger jet - induced star formation , which has been invoked as a possible explanation for alignments seen between radio sources and uv / optical emission in hzrgs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also follow - up work by e.g. @xcite ) . in this respect , it is interested to note that the radio source in the dragonfly galaxy also aligns with the main axis of the host galaxy in the _ hst _ imaging of fig.[fig : hst ] .",
    "we have provided evidence that the dragonfly galaxy ( mrc0152 - 209 ) is a high-@xmath0 ` wet ' merger , observed roughly 3.5 gyr after the big bang . with its extreme star formation and evolving radio source",

    "consistent with the very high star formation rates ( sfr@xmath13000 m@xmath3 yr@xmath14 ) found in previous ir studies of the dragonfly galaxy , our new wht spectrum confirm the presence of enhanced and heavily obscured star formation through a high ly@xmath5/heii emission - line ratio and low @xmath106 .    _",
    "the small ( 18 kpc ) radio source appears to be aligned with widespread co(1 - 0 ) emission , suggesting a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the cold gas reservoir .",
