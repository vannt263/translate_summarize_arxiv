    "the east process is a one - dimensional spin system that was introduced in the physics literature by jckle and eisinger  @xcite in 1991 to model the behavior of cooled liquids near the glass transition point , specializing a class of models that goes back to  @xcite .",
    "each site in @xmath4 has a @xmath5-value ( vacant / occupied ) , and , denoting this configuration by @xmath6 , the process attempts to update @xmath7 to @xmath8 at rate @xmath9 ( a parameter ) and to @xmath10 at rate @xmath11 , only accepting the proposed update if @xmath12 ( a `` kinetic constraint '' ) .",

    "was first proved in a beautiful work of aldous and diaconis  @xcite in 2002 .",
    "this implies that @xmath16 is of order @xmath0 for any fixed threshold @xmath20 for the total - variation distance from @xmath13 .    for a configuration @xmath6 with @xmath21 ,",
    "call this rightmost 0 its _ front _ @xmath22 ; key questions on the east process @xmath23 revolve the law @xmath24 of the sites behind the front at time @xmath25 , basic properties of which remain unknown .",
    "one can imagine that the front advances to the right as a biased walk , behind which @xmath26 ( its trail is mixed ) . indeed , if one ( incorrectly ! ) ignores dependencies between sites as well as the randomness in the position of the front , it is tempting to conclude that @xmath24 converges to @xmath13 , since upon updating a site @xmath27 its marginal is forever set to bernoulli(@xmath14 ) .",
    "whence , the positive vs.  negative increments to @xmath22 would have rates @xmath28 ( a 0-update at @xmath29 ) vs.  @xmath30 ( a 1-update at @xmath22 with a 0 at its left ) , giving the front an asymptotic speed @xmath31 .",
    "of course , ignoring the irregularity near the front is problematic , since it is precisely the distribution of those spins that governs the speed of the front ( hence mixing ) .",
    "still , just as a biased random walk , one expects the front to move at a positive speed with normal fluctuations , whence its concentrated passage time through an interval would imply total - variation _ cutoff _  a sharp transition in mixing  within an @xmath1-window .    to discuss the behavior behind the front ,",
    "let @xmath32 denote the set of configurations @xmath33 on the negative half - line @xmath34 with a fixed 0 at the origin , and let @xmath35 evolve via the east process constantly re - centered ( shifted by at most 1 ) to keep its front at the origin .",
    "blondel  @xcite showed ( see theorem  [ blondel1 ] ) that the process @xmath35 converges to an invariant measure @xmath2 , on which very little is known , and that @xmath36 converges in probability to a positive limiting value @xmath37 as @xmath38 ( an asymptotic velocity ) given by the formula @xmath39 ( we note that @xmath40 by the invariance of the measure @xmath2 and the fact that @xmath41 . )    the east process @xmath23 of course entails the joint distribution of @xmath35 and @xmath42 ; thus , it is crucial to understand the dependencies between these as well as the rate at which @xmath35 converges to @xmath2 as a prerequisite for results on the fluctuations of @xmath42 .",
    "our first result confirms the biased random walk intuition for the front of the east process @xmath42 , establishing a clt for its fluctuations around @xmath43 ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : front ] ) .     along a time interval of @xmath44 , vs.  its mean and standard deviation window . ]",

    "we then show that the increments @xmath50 behave ( after an initial burn - in time ) as a stationary sequence of weakly dependent random variables ( corollary  [ cor : wf ] ) , whence one can apply an ingenious steins - method based argument of bolthausen  @xcite from 1982 to derive the clt .    moving our attention to finite volume , recall that the _ cutoff phenomenon _ ( coined by aldous and diaconis  @xcite ; see  @xcite as well as  @xcite and the references therein ) describes a sharp transition in the convergence of a finite markov chain to stationarity : over a negligible period of time ( the cutoff window ) the distance from equilibrium drops from near 1 to near @xmath10 .",
    "formally , a sequence of chains indexed by @xmath0 has cutoff around @xmath51 with window @xmath52 if @xmath53 for any fixed @xmath20 .",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite*example 4.46 ) that a biased random walk with speed @xmath41 on an interval of length @xmath0 has cutoff at @xmath54 with an @xmath1-window due to normal fluctuations .",
    "recalling the heuristics that depicts the front of the east process as a biased walk flushing a law @xmath55 in its trail , one expects precisely the same cutoff behavior .",

    "these results are detailed in  [ sec : trees ] ( theorems  [ th : main3][th : main4 ] ) .",
    "the concentration and cutoff results for the kinetically constrained models on trees ( theorems  [ th : main3][th : main4 ] ) do not apply to every scale but rather to infinitely many scales , as is sometimes the case in the context of tightness for maxima of branching random walks or discrete gaussian free fields ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite as well as the beautiful method in  @xcite to overcome this hurdle for certain branching random walks .",
