    "the organic conductor @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 , where bets is bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene ( c@xmath18s@xmath5se@xmath5h@xmath19 ) , is of considerable interest because of the properties related to the coexistence of the large magnetic 3d fe@xmath13 moments ( spin @xmath14=5/2 ) of the inorganic anions ( fecl@xmath20 ) and the conduction @xmath21-electrons ( spin @xmath22=1/2 ) in the donor molecules from the bets.@xcite it has an unusual phase diagram , including an antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase , a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) phase , and a field - induced superconducting ( fisc ) phase.@xcite also , results interpreted in terms of a ferroelectric phase transition in the metallic phase@xcite at 70 k and a relaxor ferrolectric behavior@xcite at 30 k have been reported .",
    "a mechanism used to explain the fisc phase below 5 k in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 is based upon the jaccarino - peter ( j - p ) compensation effect@xcite operating in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system.@xcite in this model , the negative exchange interaction ( @xmath23 ) between the paramagnetic 3d fe@xmath13 moment ( @xmath24 ) ( @xmath25 is the land factor and @xmath26 is the bohr magneton ) and the conduction @xmath21-electrons in the bets molecule ( @xmath27d interaction)@xcite generates a large magnetic field ( @xmath6@xmath28 ) that cancels most of the externally applied magnetic field ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) when the latter is large ( @xmath29 @xmath1 17 @xmath11 45 t ) and aligned parallel to the @xmath9 plane .",
    "this suggests that @xmath30@xmath31 ( @xmath32 = @xmath33/@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average value of the fe@xmath13 spin polarization ) at the conducting @xmath21-electrons is on the order of @xmath1 30 t and its direction is antiparallel to @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "however , this interpretation has been challenged because the superconducting state in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 can be destroyed by a very small amount of out - of - plane magnetic field ( @xmath1 0.1 t)@xcite and the alignment of the paramagnetic fe@xmath13 moment follows closely that of @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "it has also been proposed that the larkin - ovchinkov - fulde - farrell ( loff ) phase is present near the boundary of the fisc phase.@xcite    the magnetic pm@xmath11afi phase transition , which occurs at @xmath29 @xmath36 11 t ( n@xmath37el temperature @xmath38 ) , coincides with a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition@xcite ( transition temperature @xmath17 ) .",
    "the property @xmath38 = @xmath17 indicates that the mi and afi transitions are cooperative transitions.@xcite thus , it is expected this pm@xmath11afi transition is also a result of the @xmath27d interaction , since the study of its iso - structural nonmagnetic and non-3d - electron analog @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4gacl@xmath5 shows that it exhibits a behavior @xcite that is completely different from that of @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 .",
    "however , the detailed role of the @xmath27d interaction for the pm@xmath11afi phase transition is not yet clear because it has not yet been established by direct experimental evidence .",
    "prior reports of proton nmr measurements on @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 include the spectra of a large ( @xmath1 6.5 mg ) aggregate of crystals aligned along the @xmath39-axis in a magnetic field @xcite of 2.2 t and a preliminary report @xcite of our measurements on a @xmath1 4 @xmath2 g single crystal , for which the spectrum results are presented and analyzed in detail here .",
    "a comparison of the results from the aggregate sample@xcite and the significantly different ones on the single crystal reported here is discussed is section iv.f .",
    "the crystal structure@xcite of @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 , shown in fig .",

    "there are four bets molecules and two fe@xmath13 ions per unit cell and the bets moleicules are stacked along the @xmath8- and @xmath39-axes to form a quasi - stacking fourfold structure .",
    "the conducting layers , comprised of bets , are sandwiched along the @xmath42-axis by the insulating layers of fecl@xmath20 anions .",
    "the least conducting axis is @xmath42 , @xmath9 is the conducting plane , and the easy axis of the antiferromagnetic spin structure is @xmath1 30@xmath44 away from the @xmath39 axis ( @xmath49 needle axis of the crystal).@xcite    in this paper , measurements of the proton nmr spectrum of a single @xmath1 4 @xmath2 g crystal of @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 are reported with a magnetic field @xmath6@xmath7 = 9 t applied parallel to the @xmath8-axis in the @xmath9-plane over a temperature ( @xmath12 ) range 2.0@xmath11180 k. along with our preliminary report , it is the first published report of proton nmr in a single crystal of this material .",
    "it is a challanging experiment involving an extremely small sample size ( @xmath1 0.018 mm @xmath50 0.065 mm @xmath50 1.2 mm ) .",
    "these measurements probe the distribution and the origin of the static local magnetic field at the proton sites in the pm and afi states as well as across the pm@xmath11afi phase transition .",
    "the observed properties should help to establish a microscopic model for the pm@xmath11afi phase transition .",
    "one important result of this investigation is that the dominant local magnetic field at the proton sites comes from the large dipolar field of the 3d fe@xmath13 ion moments .",
    "a mean field model based on the dipolar field of the fe@xmath13 moments is presented and used to calculate the proton nmr spectrum .",
    "it provides a good fit to the measured spectra . besides this",
    ", the total exchange constant @xmath16 between an fe@xmath13 ion and its two nearest neighbors is determined to be @xmath16 @xmath1 @xmath111.7 k from a fit to the spectrum data .",
    "these measurements also show that there is a significant change in the static local magnetic field distribution at the proton sites across the pm@xmath11afi phase transition .",
    "no proton nmr evidence of a ferroelectric phase transition at 70 k is observed in these measurements .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the experimental details and section iii has the experimental results for the proton nmr spectra , including frequency distributions , shifts , and linewidths .",
    "section iv presents the model for the spectrum , along with the comparison with the measured spectra .",
    "the conclusions are stated in section v.",
    "the needle - like single crystal @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 samples were prepared as described by montgomery et al . with a standard electrochemical oxidation method.@xcite",
    "the dimensions of the sample used for these @xmath0h - nmr measurements are ( 1.2 @xmath51 0.1 ) mm @xmath50 ( 0.065 @xmath51 0.010 ) mm @xmath50 ( 0.018 @xmath51 0.005 ) mm , which corresponds to ( 3.8 @xmath51 1.8 ) @xmath2 g in mass and ( 2.7 @xmath51 1.3 ) @xmath50 10@xmath52 protons .",
    "the nmr coil used was 40 turns of 0.025 mm diameter bare copper wire wound on a 0.075 mm diameter wire form .",
    "the coil was held to the rest of the probe circuit by two 125 @xmath2 m diameter cu wire leads with teflon insulation , which was removed close to the ends where the coil was soldered to them .",
    "commercial pure acetone was used for cleaning the coil and its surroundings when the nmr coil was set on the probe to reduce the spurious proton signals relative to the signals from such a small sample .",
    "finally , a single piece of the needle shape @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 single crystal sample was slid into the coil , carefully aligned close to @xmath29 @xmath53 @xmath8 in the @xmath9-plane , and held in place with a very small amount of commercial apiezon grease on each end .",
    "the orientation is done visually under a microscope with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath1 @xmath51 5@xmath44 .",
    "[ note : the @xmath9-plane is @xmath1 in the sample surface plane which has the largest surface area , the @xmath39-axis @xmath49 the needle direction of the sample , and the angle between the @xmath8- and @xmath39-axes is @xmath45 ( @xmath45 = 96.67(1@xmath44 ) at 298 k)].@xcite    as shown in the preliminary report,@xcite the spurious proton signal was estimated to be less than @xmath1 4@xmath54 of the signal from the @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 sample by comparing the signal with and without the sample in the coil .",
    "thus , in these measurements the spurious proton signal has an insignificant size .",
    "the @xmath0h - nmr frequency - swept spectra were obtained using standard spin - echo techniques carried out with a spectrometer and probe built at ucla .",
    "since the proton has a gyromagnetic ratio @xmath55 = 42.5759 mhz / t , the frequency @xmath56 for the excitation pulses used for the spectrometer is near @xmath56 @xmath1 @xmath57 = @xmath58 = 382.6935 ( mhz ) , where @xmath57 is the proton larmor frequency in the external field .",
    "the value of @xmath29 used in this experiment was @xmath29 = 8.9885 t ( for simplicity , often referred to here as 9 t ) .    because the nmr spectrum covers a wide range in frequency up to 14 mhz ( 3.3 kg ) , short rf pulses and a wide receiver bandwidth ( @xmath51 1 mhz )",
    "were used to record the spin - echo signals . the pulse sequence that optimized the height of the spin echo used to record",
    "the nmr signal was a 0.2 @xmath2s @xmath21/2 pulse ( @xmath59 = 294 g , 1.25 mhz proton frequency ) followed by a 0.3 @xmath2s pulse separated by a time interval @xmath60 ( @xmath60 @xmath1 5 @xmath2s ) for most of the measurements . for a viable signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "each echo signal was averaged 2000 times at 180 k and 128 times at 4.2 k and lower temperatures . the uncertainty associated with",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is probably the main source of error in the data .",
    "the uncertainties include @xmath1 @xmath51 1@xmath54 in @xmath12 and @xmath51 5@xmath44 in the field alignment .    at low @xmath12 ,",
    "the spectrum is very wide ( @xmath1 12 mhz ) and the frequency sweep covered a range as high as 370 to 400 mhz and used a typical frequency step for each acquisition of 0.2 @xmath11 0.5 mhz .",
    "when a wide frequency sweep range was used , the probe circuit was retuned every 4 mhz to maintain a uniformly high sensitivity ( above 85@xmath54 ) for recording the proton spectrum .",
    "the spectra were analyzed with frequency - shifted and -summed fourier transform processing.@xcite",
    "figure 2 shows the normalized @xmath0h - nmr absorption spectra @xmath61 $ ] of a @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 single crystal as a function of the frequency shift @xmath56 @xmath11 @xmath57 with @xmath6@xmath7 = 8.9885 t parallel to the @xmath8-axis in the @xmath9-plane for @xmath12 = 180 k to 2 k.    over most of this range , the spectra have six main peaks which can be divided into two groups ( low frequency side and high frequency side ) with 3 main peaks for each .",
    "as @xmath12 is lowered from 180 to 4.2 k in the pm state , the spectrum broadens significantly , its center shifts to lower frequency and the splitting between the peaks increases .",
    "for such a complex spectrum , a reasonable measure of its center is the first moment , @xmath62 , given by @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 indexes equally spaced frequency steps . the average shift of the spectrum ( @xmath65 ) indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 , is @xmath66 .",
    "also , some additional weak structures gradually develop at lower @xmath12 .",
    "as the sample is cooled further into the afi phase ( @xmath12 @xmath67 @xmath17 = 3.5 k ) , the details of the spectrum become somewhat smeared , an additional peak at 4.25 mhz appears and it grows larger with further cooling ( solid line in fig .",
    "as discussed in later sections , this relatively complex spectrum is caused mainly by the dipolar field of the 3d fe@xmath13 ion electron spin moments ( @xmath68 = 5/2 , @xmath69 2 ) at 16 magnetically inequivalent proton sites in both the pm and afi phases . in both phases ,",
    "these moments are present , the major differences being that they should have long - range order and a different orientation in the afi state .    at the lowest @xmath12 in the pm state ,",
    "the average mganetization of each fe@xmath13 ion is almost completely saturated by @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the main changes in the nmr spectrum associated with the afi phase are caused by changes in the orientation of the fe@xmath13 average spin moments , not by changes in their magnitude .    in the afi phase ( @xmath12 @xmath67 @xmath17 )",
    ", the changes of the spectrum vs @xmath12 , such as the smearing of the spectrum details and the growth of the new peak at the high frequency side , occur gradually rather than suddenly .",
    "this behavior indicates a continuous change of the local magnetic field distribution at the proton sites as @xmath12 is lowered .",
    "its origin is probably the development of the canted - antiferromagnetic phase as observed from the field dependence of magnetization and capacitance measurements reported@xcite for @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 .",
    "figure 3 shows the frequency shift magnitude @xmath70 as a function of @xmath12 , and the inset of fig .",
    "3 plots 1/@xmath70 vs t. a clear discontinuity of @xmath65 at @xmath12 = @xmath17 is seen .",
    "the error bars are our best estimate of the uncertainty in our data analysis .",
    "the nmr frequency at the @xmath64th proton site is @xmath71@xmath72 , where @xmath6@xmath73 is the total magnetic field at the site .",
    "since @xmath6@xmath73 is the sum of the large applied @xmath6@xmath7 plus the much smaller field generated by the sample ( @xmath74@xmath7 ) , it is easily shown that the field shift caused by the magnetic properties of the sample is the component of its field parallel to @xmath6@xmath7 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath65 in fig .",
    "3 represent the average of @xmath75 over the proton sites ( @xmath76 ) with @xmath77 thus , the origin of @xmath65 is the distribution of @xmath75 over the proton sites .    at 180 k , @xmath65 has a value of @xmath11(0.13 @xmath51 0.02 ) mhz , while at 4 k it reaches @xmath11(1.750 @xmath51 0.005 ) mhz . below @xmath17 = 3.5 k",
    ", @xmath65 has a rather weak temperature dependence , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 . the sudden decrease of 1/@xmath70 at @xmath17 indicates an increase of the average static local magnetic field at the proton sites due to the pm@xmath11afi phase transition .",
    "its sharpness is evidence that the pm@xmath11afi phase transition is first order .",

    "a reasonable quantitative measure of the width of the local field distribution that generates the proton spectrum of @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 is the root mean square ( rms ) linewidth , @xmath78 , i.e. the square root of the second moment , @xmath79 , given by @xcite @xmath80^{1/2}.\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the measurements of @xmath78 for protons as a function of @xmath81 in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 are shown in fig .",

    "there are several important properties of the data shown in figs .",

    ", it can be shown that the @xmath15dependence of all of them ( @xmath62 , @xmath70 , and @xmath78 ) follows the curie - weiss relation with a curie - weiss temperature @xmath83 5.5 k. they also follow the brillouin function @xmath84 $ ] behavior using the parameters for the fe@xmath13 spins .",
    "this result is a strong indication that the dominant contribution to @xmath85@xmath7 is the dipolar field at the proton sites from the magnetization of the fe@xmath13 spins .",
    "an important issue for characterizing the data is that they extend well into the low @xmath12 regime ; i.e. , at 9 t , the zeeman splitting between the highest and lowest fe@xmath13 spin states is 5 @xmath86 @xmath87 60.5 k , where @xmath88 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "for this reason , instead of the more commonly used curie@xmath11weiss law , which is a high @xmath12 approximation ( @xmath89 @xmath90 30.2 k ) , we characterize the data with the brillouin function , which includes magnetic saturation at low @xmath12 .",
    "also , since there is a significant total antiferromagnetic ( negative ) exchange interaction @xmath16 among the fe@xmath13 moments , @xcite the brillouin function used here is modified to include a simple , approximate mean field correction .    for non - interacting moments , the magnetization @xmath91 $ ]",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is avogadro s number , @xmath94 = @xmath14 = 5/2 for the fe@xmath13 , and @xmath95 is @xmath96 where @xmath97 the effect of @xmath16 for an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the nearest neighbor fe@xmath13 moments can be modeled as an additional magnetic field component ( @xmath98 ) antiparallel to @xmath6@xmath7,@xcite given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 and the right side of eq .",
    "7 has been used for @xmath98 . because the value obtained later for @xmath98",
    "is substantially smaller than @xmath29 , this approximation is a reasonable one .",

    "4 , from the @xmath15dependence of @xmath78 the best fit is obtained with @xmath16 = @xmath11(1.7 @xmath51 0.2 ) k. this corresponds to a maxmium total exchange field of @xmath1 @xmath11 3 t below @xmath1 5 k. the negative sign of @xmath16 indicates that the fe@xmath13 ions have an antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange interactions with their nearest neighbors .",
    "since each fe@xmath13 ion has two nearest neighbors @xcite ( actually three closest ones : two are at @xmath1 6.6 @xmath106 away , and one at @xmath1 7.6 @xmath106 away ) the exchange constant @xmath107 between each pair of fe@xmath13 ions is , @xmath107 @xmath90 @xmath16/2 = @xmath11(0.85 @xmath51 0.10 ) k , which agrees with theoretical expectations ( @xmath108 0.64 k).@xcite the parameter @xmath109 has a fitted value of ( 100 @xmath51 6 ) @xmath110(mol.fe / emu)hz@xmath111 $ ] [ note : the units for @xmath112 are emu / mol.fe ; see eqs .",

    "in this section , the local magnetic fields at the proton sites and the @xmath0h - nmr spectrum are calculated , and the nature of the afi phase transition is discussed .",
    "generally nmr spectra are determined by the values of static local magnetic field and the distribution of the local magnetic field at the nucleus sites in the studied material . here ,",

    "the calculated result includes the dipolar field from the fe@xmath13 electrons , and corrections for the lorentz and bulk demagnetization fields .",
    "there are several small differences between the measured and calculated model spectra shown in fig .",

    "@xmath78 = 1.126 mhz and 1.387 mhz for the model and measured values , respectively , corresponding to a difference of @xmath1 18@xmath54 .",
    "another small difference is in the shape of the spectra .",
    "these similarities in the model and measured spectra strongly support the conclusion that the proton spectrum in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 is dominated by the dipole field of the fe@xmath13 ions .",
    "an important question is what is responsible for the small difference between the spectra calculated with the model that has been used and the measured spectra .",
    "it is probably caused by not including all the details of the exchange interactions ( including the d@xmath11d exchange interactions through the cl@xmath125 and through the bets conduction @xmath27electrons ) between the fe@xmath13 electron spins when using the mean field @xmath112 or @xmath101 to model the fe@xmath13 electron spin polarization .",
    "also , an important aspect of the @xmath27d interaction which is also part of the d@xmath11d exchange interactions is that it should be responsible for the coordination of the occurrence of the pm@xmath11afi phase transition .",
    "it is expected that if all of the exchange interactions are included in detail , they will cause a small change in the moment of the fe@xmath13 ions and their polarization will not be precisely along @xmath169 , even in the pm phase .",
    "it is likely that these additional factors are responsible for the relatively small difference between the measured and calculated shift and width in the @xmath0h - nmr spectrum . to include them in a model",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper .      as in the pm state ,",
    "the local magnetic field at the proton sites in the afi state ( @xmath12 @xmath67 @xmath17 = 3.5 k ) is also dominated by the dipolar field from the fe@xmath13 ions , even though eq .",
    "( 17 ) is not specific to and may not apply in the afi state . in both phases ,",
    "the fe@xmath13 ion electron spin moments are present and the general hamiltonian @xmath113 of the @xmath0h - nmr system eq .",
    "( 11 ) or ( 12 ) applies in both the pm and afi states .",
    "however , the change of the @xmath0h - nmr spectra in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 is significant .",
    "on cooling from the pm to the afi state , the spectrum broadens , the splittings are smeared out , and a new peak appears on the high frequency side .",
    "it is unlikely that these changes are caused by variations in the lorentz or demagnetization field because the contribution from each of them is essentially the same at each proton site , even though they are proportional to the fe@xmath13 ion electron susceptibility .",
    "therefore the changes of the details in the proton spectra at any @xmath12 ( including in the pm and afi phases ) come mainly from the change of the dipolar field of the 3d fe@xmath13 ions , which in part are changed by the effect of @xmath27d and d@xmath11d interactions on the polarization of the fe@xmath13 moments .",
    "the major difference for the fe@xmath13 moments is that they should have long - range order in the afi state , which is formed by the @xmath27d and d@xmath11d interactions . @xcite",
    "the evidence from the change of the @xmath0h - nmr spectra , as well as that reflected by the discontinuities of the frequency shift @xmath65 and the rms linewidth @xmath170 , is indicative of a first order nature for the pm@xmath11afi phase transition in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite      in this section , we first compare our results on a single @xmath1 4 @xmath2 g crystal with those reported by endo et al.@xcite on a large ( @xmath1 6.5 mg ) aggregate of crystals aligned along the @xmath39-axis .",
    "one major difference is that since their @xmath6@xmath7 = 2.2 t was applied perpendicular to the @xmath39-axis , the corresponding @xmath0h - nmr spectrum is the average over all alignments of @xmath6@xmath7 perpendicular to the @xmath39-axis .",
    "it is expected that in comparison to the measurements reported here on a single crystal , this average will smear out some of the details of the spectrum and will generate a broader range of lorentz and demagnetization fields that also have an effect on the spectrum .",
    "another important difference is that because @xmath6@xmath7 in our measurements is 4.1 times larger than that used in their work , the splittings and shifts of the spectral features is expected to be 4.1 times larger ; i.e. , the spectral resolution of our 9 t measurements is significantly higher .    their results @xcite showed the onset of a splitting of the spectrum near 70 k that was considered an anomaly and interpreted as possible evidence for a charge disproportionation of the @xmath21-electrons associated with a ferroelectric - type phase transition .",
    "they further suggested @xcite that this splitting is from the hyperfine field between the proton nucleus and @xmath21 electrons and not the dipole field of the fe@xmath13 ions .",
    "our results disagree with their results and interpretation in several ways .",
    "first , our measurements ( fig . 2 ) show a continuous increase in the splitting and the shift ( fig .",
    "3 ) of the spectrum as @xmath12 is decreased from 180 to @xmath1 5 k. no evidence for an anomaly near 70 k is observed and the main features of the spectra are well explained in terms of the model based upon the dipole field of the fe@xmath13 ions .",
    "another problem with the interpretation by endo et al.@xcite is that if the spectral splitting is caused by the hyperfine field between the proton nucleus and @xmath21 electrons , it would require a large hyperfine shift of @xmath1 50 g , corresponding to a knight shift of @xmath1 0.23@xmath54 .",
    "it is very unlikely that such a large shift could occur for the very light nucleus of a hydrogen atom .",
    "experimetal evidence that such a large hyperfine field does not occur at the proton sites is also indicated by comparing the proton spin - lattice relaxation rate ( 1/@xmath171 ) at 100 k in@xcite @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 and@xcite @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4gacl@xmath5 .",
    "both materials have the same structure and related properties , but without the magnetization of the fe@xmath172 ions in the ga compound .",
    "if the main fluctuating magnetic field at the proton site were from the @xmath21 electrons , one would expect approximately the same value of 1/@xmath171 for both materials .",
    "instead , at 100 k 1/@xmath171 has a value that is @xmath1 10@xmath152 times larger in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 than in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4gacl@xmath5 .",
    "futhermore , in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 , 1/@xmath173 has the @xmath15dependence expected from the saturation of the magnetization of the fe@xmath13 ions .",
    "@xcite    these properties provide strong support to our interpretation that the dominant internal magnetic field at the protons in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 is the dipole field of the fe@xmath172 ions , and that there is no anomalous splitting of the spectrum near 70 k.    other interpretations of a ferroelectric phase transition at 70 k in @xmath3-(bets)@xmath4fecl@xmath5 are based upon the discontinuity reported for its specific heat,@xcite the division of the electron spin resonance @xmath174factor from one into two values,@xcite and the increase in the microwave dielectric constant.@xcite it is not yet clear why the effect of such a transition on the magnetization of the fe@xmath13 ions is so small that it is not seen in our @xmath0h - nmr spectrum measurements .",
