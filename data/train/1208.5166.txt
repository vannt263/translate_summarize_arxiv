    "second , the sm does not contain any viable particle candidates for dark matter ( dm ) , which is needed to explain a large array of astrophysical and cosmological observations . from a more theoretical perspective",
    ", the sm additionally falls short of explaining the large hierarchies between fundamental physical scales .",
    "in particular , it provides no satisfactory explanation for why the planck scale , @xmath0 gev , is so much higher than the electroweak ( ew ) scale , @xmath1 gev .",
    "this is known as the hierarchy problem .    in recent years , several models",
    "have been suggested that address the hierarchy problem . in particular , models with warped extra dimensions , such as randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenarios ,",
    "have been proposed which naturally generate the hierarchy between the planck and ew scales @xcite . in rs models , the universe is described by a five - dimensional ( 5d ) geometry with two four - dimensional ( 4d ) branes located at the uv ( planck ) and ir ( tev ) points .",
    "the higgs fields are localized on ( or near ) the ir brane , and the warped fifth dimension `` redshifts '' the planck scale to the tev scale , providing a rather elegant solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "additionally , by placing the sm fermions in the bulk , hierarchies between the yukawa couplings can be accounted for by the wave - function overlap with the higgs boson in the fifth dimension @xcite .    while explaining the hierarchy problem , simply embedding the sm in a rs scenario is not fully satisfactory .",
    "to prevent sizable cp - violating effects from kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes in the absence of additional flavor structure , the ir scale must be at or above @xmath2 tev@xmath3@xcite .",
    "precision electroweak experiments also dictate that the ir scale must be larger than the ew scale , hence some additional tuning is required between these scales .",
    "this is an incarnation of the so - called _ little _ hierarchy problem . to resolve this issue , models of  emergent \" or  accidental",
    "\" supersymmetry have been proposed ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in which supersymmetry ( susy ) emerges as an accidental symmetry in the ir , with susy broken on the uv brane . as a result , the higgs mass can be protected from radiative corrections up to the ir scale , while the warped extra dimension generates the hierarchy between the tev and planck scales . within this framework , which we describe in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : accidental_susy ] , both hierarchy problems can potentially be resolved .",
    "the specific particle content of the theory depends on the model of susy embedded in the randall - sundrum spacetime .",
    "since we are interested in the general features of accidental supersymmetric models , we will consider the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) as a conservative case from the standpoint of the field content of the theory .",
    "randall - sundrum scenarios can do more than just solve the big and little hierarchy problems .",
    "in fact , we show here that models with warped extra dimensions may also provide an explanation for the origin of the baryon asymmetry via the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis ( ewb ) .",
    "crucial to this mechanism are",
    "a number of conditions , ultimately related to those generically needed for any dynamical mechanism for the production of a baryon asymmetry @xcite : first , one needs departure from thermal equilibrium at the electroweak scale ; second , one needs large enough charge ( c ) and charge - parity ( cp ) violation ; third , one needs violation of baryon number .",
    "the second and third conditions are easily satisfied in the context of supersymmetric ewb models : any minimal supersymmetric extension to the sm , in fact , contains numerous ( albeit constrained ) new sources of cp violation , while baryon number ( b ) violation , is provided by sm weak sphalerons  we will comment on this more below .",
    "more critical is how to have a large deviation from thermal equilibrium  a condition in practice realized , in the context of ewb , via a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , here the rs setup may be of crucial importance , as we also explain below .",
    "while the universe is described by the randall - sundrum spacetime at zero temperature , at finite temperature , rs models possess an additional high - temperature phase , described by an anti - de sitter - schwarzschild ( ads - s ) spacetime with a black hole horizon replacing the tev brane @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "a holographic description facilitated by the ads - cft correspondence also exists in which the two phases correspond to a deconfined and to a confined phase of a strongly coupled gauge theory , respectively .",
    "provided that the free energy of the rs phase is less than the free energy of the ads - s phase , @xmath4 , a phase transition can occur between the two : as the universe cools below a temperature @xmath5 , bubbles of the tev brane can begin to nucleate out of the black hole horizon @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for further discussion of the confining phase transition ) .",
    "because , from the cft perspective , conformal invariance is only spontaneously broken in the rs phase , @xmath6 implies that the rs phase is metastable . for the confining phase transition to occur",
    ", one must introduce some mechanism to explicitly break conformal invariance . from the ads perspective , this can be accomplished by stabilizing the radion ( the field governing the separation between the uv and ir branes ) with a potential generated e.g. by additional 5d fields . once the radion is stabilized , the free energy of the two phases will be equal at some temperature @xmath7 producing a phase transition via bubble nucleation with nucleation temperature @xmath8 . in many cases , @xmath9 can be significantly lower than the temperature of the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) predicted by the 4d minkowski theory @xcite .",
    "since the higgs sector is typically confined to the ir brane , this low nucleation temperature results in a `` _ supercooled _ '' ewpt ( i.e. taking place at lower temperatures than otherwise possible ) , thereby potentially strengthening the phase transition . while this supercooling was studied specifically in the case of the sm embedded in rs with a goldberger - wise potential @xcite for the radion in ref .",
    "@xcite , this possibility is a consequence of the geometry and localization of the higgs sector in the ir and is largely independent of the particle content of the theory and can therefore potentially arise in accidental susy as well . as a result , models of accidental susy may provide a strongly first order ewpt even _ without _",
    "e.g. a light right - handed scalar top ( stop ) quark @xcite , or additional singlets contributing to the higgs potential @xcite , as is typically required for successful ewb in the mssm . alternatively , as we explain in the next section , certain incarnations of the accidental susy framework also posit , as a solution to the @xmath10-problem , an additional extension to the higgs sector via a singlet scalar field .",
    "this potentially provides an additional route to a strongly first order electroweak phase transition .    since a strongly first order phase transition appears to be a natural possibility in accidental susy , the remaining issue pertinent to ewb is the requirement of large enough cp - violation to seed weak sphalerons , which will be the primary focus for the rest of this study .",
    "in fact , accidental susy naturally satisfies this requirement as well . even in its mssm incarnation ,",
    "there are several new cp - violating phases which can source the baryon asymmetry . in particular , there are new phases arising in the higgsino - gaugino and third - generation scalar sectors . it has recently been shown that of the third - generation scalars , only cp - violating stau sources can account for the observed baryon asymmetry while still conforming to various phenomenological and experimental constraints from electric dipole moment searches @xcite . here",
    "we concern ourselves with moderate values of the ratio of higgs vevs , @xmath11 , in which case the stau sources are suppressed",
    ". we will therefore be interested in ewb with higgsino - gaugino sources in accidental susy .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis utilizing these sources in the mssm has been extensively analyzed in recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) , and we build on these analyses in our study of the accidental susy scenario . note that extending the particle content beyond that of the mssm would provide more potential sources of cp - violation .",
    "supersymmetric rs models also have the added benefit of generically containing a viable dark matter candidate , if the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) corresponds to the lightest neutralino , over some regions of parameter space .",
    "this is a result of @xmath12-parity conservation , whereby the lsp is stable .",
    "thus it may be possible for accidental susy to simultaneously explain the origin of the bau and the nature of dark matter , while also solving both the big and little hierarchy problems .",
    "in fact , the production of both the relic dm density and the baryon asymmetry via higgsino - gaugino sources are closely connected @xcite , since both depend predominantly on the higgsino mass term @xmath10 and on the gaugino soft - supersymmetry breaking masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , enforcing both the correct dm properties and baryon asymmetry in conformity with various observational constraints may result in sharp predictions for the regions of interest within the accidental susy parameter space .",
    "this is an attractive possibility and one which we explore in the present study .    in what follows",
    "we compute the baryon asymmetry across the parameter space of a minimal ( mssm - like ) incarnation of accidental susy .",
    "we do so independently of the specifics of susy breaking , choosing higgsino and gaugino masses which yield the correct dm relic density ( this is the so - called  well - tempered neutralino \" setup @xcite ) and assuming a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition arising either from the supercooling provided by the ads - s transition or from the contribution of a gauge singlet super - field to the effective potential .",
    "we then impose constraints from electric dipole moment ( edm ) measurements and from dark matter searches to outline potentially viable regions of the parameter space .",
    "we also consider the impact of the projected sensitivities of these various experiments . in doing so",
    ", we find that accidental susy models , even in their most minimal incarnations , may allow for successful ewb and a viable dm candidate provided that the resulting soft breaking wino mass , @xmath14 , and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath10 are roughly degenerate , with the lsp a bino - higgsino admixture ; we also require the mssm heavy higgs sector to lie relatively close to twice the lsp mass .",
    "these findings can be used to hone in on specific models of accidental susy giving rise to the observed properties of our universe .",
    "the framework of accidental susy can be used to both generate a hierarchy between the planck and ir scales and a little hierarchy between the electroweak and ir scales by embedding supersymmetry in an rs spacetime @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass is protected from higher order corrections up to the ir scale @xmath15 by requiring the superpartners of the third - generation quarks , as well as those of the gauge and higgs bosons , to be light in order to cancel the loop corrections from their sm counterparts to the higgs mass .",
    "the warped extra dimension then takes over in protecting the hierarchy between the ir and planck scales for scales above @xmath15 . on",
    "the other hand , superpartners of the quarks and leptons of the first two generations should be heavy to avoid excessive flavor and cp - violation which would occur if the mediation of susy breaking is not flavor blind .",
    "this spectrum is reminiscent of so - called  split susy \" models @xcite .",
    "much previous work has been devoted to the study of supersymmetric randall - sundrum models @xcite ; the specifics of the resulting particle spectrum inherently rely on the underlying assumptions about particle content , susy breaking , localization of the particles in the 5d spacetime , etc .",
    "however , here we are concerned with the generic features of accidental supersymmetry relevant to ewb and to dark matter phenomenology , and so we limit our assumptions to a few key points representing the main features of this setup . for the sake of generality , we take the particle content embedded in the rs spacetime to be the minimal supersymmetric spectrum of the mssm .",
    "our assumptions about the resulting spectrum , typical of accidental susy models , are listed in the bullet points below . for the sake of illustration , we focus in this section on the model set forth in ref .",
    "@xcite as a concrete example demonstrating how these features arise in accidental susy scenarios , briefly and qualitatively summarizing some of the aspects of the setup relevant for our investigation below .",
    "we stress , however , that the remainder of this study will not necessarily depend on this particular model .",
    "we work in the 5d gravity language of the gauge - gravity duality except where noted .",

    ", the warped - down ir scale on the @xmath24 brane is assumed to be @xmath25 ( we assume @xmath26 throughout ) , and we assume the uv cutoff on the ir brane is given by @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , to naturally implement the split susy spectrum , supersymmetry is broken on the uv brane at an intermediate scale @xmath28 , with light standard model fermions localized near the uv brane so that their superpartners feel susy - breaking maximally .",
    "this results in heavy first- and second - generation sfermions . meanwhile , the higgsinos and stops are localized near the ir brane so that they remain light .",
    "the gauginos are protected by an accidental @xmath12-symmetry ( they have sizable wavefunction overlap with the uv brane , and so would typically be heavy without this symmetry ) .",
    "one can introduce both ( i ) a bulk hypermultiplet , which obtains an @xmath29-term when susy breaking occurs from its coupling to a susy - breaking spurion on the uv brane , and ( ii ) a constant superpotential on the ir brane with mass scale @xmath30 .",

    "we are ultimately interested in the low energy phenomenology of accidental susy models , below the cutoff @xmath33 . to extract the low energy effective theory",
    ", one must integrate over the extra dimension and account for the effects of the radion superfield by canonically normalizing the radion and chiral superfields localized on the ir brane .",

    "we comment more on this below , but for the moment we shall simply assume some tuning so that @xmath40 gev .    the effective superpotential @xmath35 in eq .",
    "[ eq : superpotential ] shows that there can be considerable differences between the low energy phenomenology of a supersymmetric rs theory and its 4d flat - space counterpart due to the presence of the radion superfield .",
    "the khler potential is also typically non - minimal in such theories @xcite .",
    "the effective superpotential and khler potential can result in mixing between the radion and higgs , between the radion superpartner ( the  radino \" ) and higssinos , as well as couplings of the radion fields to the other ir - localized degrees of freedom . while these effects are interesting from the standpoint of low - energy phenomenology ,",
    "they are largely model - dependent and so we neglect them for the remainder of our study .",
    "in particular , we assume that : ( 1 ) the radino mass ( which depends on the details of susy breaking ) is large enough so that it decouples from the phenomenology , and ( 2 ) that the ir - localized fields couple minimally to gravity so that there is no mixing between the higgs and radion .",
    "while these assumptions still allow for couplings of the radion to the ir - localized fields ( and thus potentially impacting the calculation of the baryon asymmetry ) , we estimate that the relevant rates are small compared to other processes of interest ( see eq .",

    "the various parts of the visible sector feel susy breaking in different ways . in ref .",

    "the gauginos must also be light , implying that the generically leading contribution to the gaugino masses @xmath46 must be suppressed ; otherwise , the gauginos would acquire soft masses @xmath47 of the same order as eq .",

    "as is well known , in the mssm , some tension exists between having light stops and obtaining a higgs mass consistent with the ( tentative ) 125 gev higgs reported by cms and atlas @xcite .",
    "a way out is having significant mixing in the stop sector , which can allow for a heavy enough higgs without decoupling the stops ( see e.g. ref .",
    "this possibility would not change the phenomenology relevant for calculating the baryon asymmetry or dark matter density ( although it would require some additional tuning ) . on a related note , in considering the particle content of the mssm embedded in the rs spacetime",

    "this could be addressed by considering e.g. the nmssm higgs sector ( as in ref .",

    "as we will see , the above features of the typical accidental susy spectrum are attractive from both the standpoint of dark matter and electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "in the context of minimal supersymmetric extensions to the standard model with heavy sfermion masses and a neutralino lsp , as in the low - energy effective theories of accidental susy of interest here , the thermal relic density of the lsp is fixed by ( i ) the relevant entries in the neutralino mass matrix : the higgsino mass term @xmath10 , the bino soft supersymmetry breaking mass term @xmath13 , and the wino soft supersymmetry breaking mass term @xmath14 ; and ( ii ) the presence or absence of a resonant annihilation channel via the light ( @xmath63 ) or heavy @xmath64 higgses , or with the @xmath65 boson .",

    "<S> we show that `` accidental '' supersymmetry is a beyond - the - standard model framework that naturally accommodates a thermal relic dark matter candidate and successful electroweak baryogenesis , including the needed strongly first - order character of the electroweak phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we study the phenomenology of this setup from the standpoint of both dark matter and baryogenesis . for energies around the electroweak phase transition temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy effective theory is similar to the mssm with light super - partners of the third - generation quarks and of the higgs and gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the dark matter relic abundance and the baryon asymmetry across the accidental supersymmetry parameter space , including resonant and non - resonant cp - violating sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are regions of parameter space producing both the observed value of the baryon asymmetry and a dark matter candidate with the correct relic density and conforming to present - day constraints from dark matter searches . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario makes sharp predictions for the particle spectrum , predicting a lightest neutralino mass between 200 and 500 gev , with all charginos and neutralinos within less than a factor 2 of the lightest neutralino mass and the heavy higgs sector within 20 - 25% of that mass , making it an interesting target for collider searches . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate that successful accidental supersymmetric dark matter and baryogenesis will be conclusively tested with improvements smaller than one order of magnitude to the current performance of electron electric dipole moment searches and of direct dark matter searches , as well as with icecube plus deep core neutrino telescope data . </S>"
