    "it is well known that the potential energy curves of diatomic molecules do not cross ( in fact , they even avoid each other ) when the states have the same symmetry .",
    "this property of the electronic energies , commonly known as the non - crossing rule , has proved useful for the interpretation of many experiments in molecular spectroscopy and photochemistry@xcite . the theoretical explanation outlined by teller@xcite , and typically reproduced in most textbooks on quantum chemistry@xcite , was criticized by razi naqvi and byers brown@xcite . after arguing that such a proof is based on a _ non sequitur _ the authors proposed an alternative justification of the non - crossing rule .",
    "their argument is closely related to the hellmann - feynman theorem@xcite in its more general off - diagonal form@xcite .    as a result of a recent investigation on non - hermitian hamiltonians",
    "we were led to revise the proofs on the non - crossing rule and the purpose of this paper is to put forward our analysis and discussion of the arguments given by razi naqvi and byers brown@xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : h - f ] we derive similar equations by means of the off - diagonal hellmann - feynman theorem@xcite ( and references therein ) . in section  [ sec : examples ] we illustrate the main theoretical conclusions by means of two simple examples .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results and draw conclusions .",
    "the starting point is the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath0 it follows from @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where * stands for complex conjugation , that @xmath3 from this expression we conclude that @xmath4 when @xmath5 .",
    "this textbook result is well known but we write it here because it will be useful later on .",
    "if @xmath6 depends on a parameter @xmath7 , then the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues will depend on this parameter too .",
    "if we differentiate equation ( [ eq : schro ] ) with respect to @xmath7 and then apply the bra @xmath8 from the left we obtain the well known off - diagonal hellmann - feynman relation@xcite @xmath9 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 and @xmath11 approach each other and cross at @xmath12 : @xmath13 . when @xmath14 @xmath15 by virtue of equation ( [ eq : pre_orthogonality ] ) and because of continuity we should also have @xmath16 it follows from this equation and ( [ eq : h - f ] ) that @xmath17 without this condition the approaching energy levels will not cross giving rise to an avoided crossing that looks like an energy - level repulsion .",
    "since the two levels approach each other and then move apart the quantity @xmath18 should exhibit a minimum at some @xmath19 .",
    "this particular value of the parameter is determined by the condition @xmath20 if the symmetries of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are different , then equation ( [ eq : hmn=0 ] ) holds for all @xmath7 and nothing prevents the approaching energy levels from crossing .    throughout the discussion above we have tacitly assumed that the symmetry of @xmath6 is the same for all @xmath7 ( at least in the neighbourhood of @xmath23 under analysis ) . in other words , we have assumed that both @xmath6 and @xmath24 have the same symmetry .",
    "suppose that the point group@xcite that describes the symmetry of @xmath6 is @xmath25 when @xmath26 and @xmath27 when @xmath28 and that the order @xmath29 of @xmath25 is smaller than the order @xmath30 of @xmath27 .",
    "under such conditions the dimension of the subspaces of @xmath31 may be greater than those for @xmath32 @xmath33 and we therefore expect some level crossings at @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , equation ( [ eq : hmn=0 ] ) applies to those states that become degenerate at this point .",
    "razi naqvi@xcite took into account such symmetry changes in a discussion of the crossing of potential - energy surfaces of polyatomic molecules .",
    "it is clear that no further discussion is necessary for proving equation ( [ eq : orthogonality ] ) that was required for deriving equation ( [ eq : hmn=0 ] ) from ( [ eq : h - f ] ) .",
    "however , razi naqvi and byers brown@xcite criticized the continuity argument implied by equation ( [ eq : orthogonality ] ) . in order to discuss the additional steps in their proof",
    "we first derive another equation . if we differentiate the eigenvalue equation for @xmath21 with respect to @xmath7 and apply @xmath34 from the left we arrive at an equation similar to ( [ eq : h - f ] ) : @xmath35 subtracting the complex conjugate of equation ( [ eq : h - f_2 ] ) from equation ( [ eq : h - f ] ) we obtain @xmath36 which is obviously the derivative of equation ( [ eq : pre_orthogonality ] ) with respect to @xmath7 . when @xmath37 equation ( [ eq : deriv_orthog ] ) reduces to @xmath38 \\left\\langle \\psi _ { m}\\right .",

    "they derived an equation similar to ( [ eq : rnbb1 ] ) that reads : @xmath45 \\left\\langle \\psi _ { 1}^{0}\\right .",
    "\\left| \\psi _ { 2}^{0}\\right\\rangle = 0 ,   \\label{eq : rnbb2}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the electronic states at @xmath44 .",
    "they invoked this equation to prove that @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
    "the reason of this _ circumlocution _ was their concern about the continuity argument expressed in the statement : `` it will be well to pause here momentarily and discuss the implications of equation ( [ eq : ortho_rnbb ] ) .",
    "our demand that the two potential curves intersect at @xmath50 , forces us , to conclude that the overlap integral must vanish even when @xmath51 .",
    "it is tempting to argue that , since @xmath52 for all @xmath43 in the vicinity of @xmath44 , it seems likely , on account of continuity , that it would also be true at @xmath50 .",
    "however , this argument is not only unnecessary but misleading , for we know that degenerate eigenfunctions need not be orthogonal ; indeed we can choose them at will and make them to be non - orthogonal , if we so desire . ''",
    "the reader may convince himself that the argument leading to equation ( [ eq : orthogonality ] ) clearly implies that we do not choose those functions `` at will '' because the states at @xmath44 are just the ones that result from the limit @xmath53 and , therefore , should remain orthogonal .    in order to prove that equation ( [ eq : ortho_rnbb ] )",
    "holds even when @xmath54 , @xmath55 , provided that @xmath56 , the authors differentiate equation ( [ eq : rnbb2 ] ) with respect to @xmath43 as many times as necessary@xcite .",
    "however , it is obvious that equation ( [ eq : rnbb2 ] ) is valid only for @xmath44 because we have discarded a term from the general equation valid for all @xmath43 ( see ( [ eq : deriv_orthog ] ) ) . in order to carry out this proof",
    "correctly we should differentiate an equation like ( [ eq : deriv_orthog ] ) as many times as necessary which is equivalent to differentiating an equation similar to ( [ eq : pre_orthogonality ] ) with respect to @xmath43 just one more time .",
    "more precisely , if we define @xmath57 and @xmath58 then equation ( [ eq : pre_orthogonality ] ) becomes @xmath59 .",
    "differentiating it @xmath60 times with respect to @xmath43 and substituting @xmath50 for @xmath43 we obtain @xmath61 from which it follows that @xmath62 when @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to being simpler and clearer , this argument is free from the flaw in the additional steps of the proof attempted by razi naqvi and byers brown@xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion this discussion is unnecessary because , as argued above , @xmath64 always applies when @xmath65 .",
    "in section  [ sec : h - f ] we mentioned the possibility that the symmetry of the system may change at @xmath28 . in order to illustrate this point here we choose an extremely simple model , the quantum - mechanical harmonic oscillator @xmath66 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this dimensionless hamiltonian operator are given by @xmath67 respectively , where @xmath68 is an eigenfunction of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath69 @xmath70 .    when @xmath71 the symmetry of the system is described by the abelian point group @xmath72 that exhibits only one - dimensional irreducible representations@xcite .",
    "therefore , its states are expected to be nondegenerate , except for accidental degeneracies that may occur when @xmath73 is rational . on the other hand , when @xmath74 we have an isotropic two - dimensional oscillator so that its symmetry is described by the full two - dimensional rotation group . since all its eigenstates @xmath75 , @xmath76 are degenerate we expect and infinite number of crossings at @xmath28 .",
    "obviously , the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath77 vanish when @xmath28 in agreement with the argument given is section [ sec : h - f ] .",
    "the second example is even simpler but most interesting in some respects . in this case",
    "we choose a two - level system given by the matrix representation @xmath78 the diagonal elements intersect at @xmath79 but the eigenvalues @xmath80 exhibit an avoided crossing as shown in figure  [ fig : eh ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : h12 ] shows that the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the two column eigenvectors of @xmath84 , non only does not vanish but even exhibits a maximum precisely at @xmath79 .    it is well known that avoided crossings are associated to exceptional points in the complex plane@xcite .",
    "present case is not an exception as the eigenvalues ( [ eq : e1,e2_hermit ] ) obviously cross in the complex @xmath85-plane at @xmath86 . by means of the change of variables",
    "@xmath87 we obtain a parity - time - symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath88 with eigenvalues @xmath89 in this case the eigenvalues are real for all @xmath90 ( unbroken parity - time ( pt ) symmetry@xcite ) approach each other as @xmath91 , coalesce at the exceptional points @xmath92 and become a pair of complex conjugate numbers for @xmath93 ( broken pt symmetry ) .",
    "this behaviour is shown in figure  [ fig : enh ] . at the exceptional points the two eigenvectors",
    "are linearly dependent@xcite .",
    "it is most interesting to consider the more general case in which @xmath94 that leads to an hermitian hamiltonian when @xmath95 and a pt - symmetric one when @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d ] shows that @xmath97 is given by two intersecting surfaces that leave a hole where they do not touch .",
    "the intersection of the whole composite surface with the plane @xmath98 yields the curves shown in figure  [ fig : eh ] for the hermitian hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_hermit ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the intersection with the plane @xmath99 yields the curve in figure  [ fig : enh ] for the eigenvalues of the pt - symmetric hamiltonian ( [ eq : k_non - hermit ] ) , where @xmath100 .",
    "the arguments put forward by razi naqvi and byers brown@xcite are basically correct , except for the discussion of the orthogonality of the states at the crossing point @xmath44 . in the first place",
    ", there is no problem with the orthogonality of the states at this point if one chooses them to be the result of the limit @xmath53 .",
    "such states are not at all arbitrary and conserve their orthogonality even at the point of degeneracy . if one had any doubt about the orthogonality of the states at the crossing point one could in fact prove it as shown in equation ( [ eq : add_proof_ort ] ) that is an improvement on the argument given by those authors that leads to the correct answer but is based on an inadequate equation .",
