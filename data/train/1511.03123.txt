    "during solar flares a large amount of energetic non - thermal electrons , i.e. with energies greater than 20 kev is generated with a production rate of typically @xmath0 s@xmath1 ( warmuth et al .",
    "[ 2009 ] ) . about 0.1 to 1% of them ( lin & hudson [ 1971 ] ) are able to propagate along open magnetic field lines through the corona into interplanetary space .",
    "signatures of these electrons can be observed as so called type iii bursts in dynamic radio spectra ( suzuki & dulk [ 1985 ] , gurnett [ 1995 ] ) . at a greater distance ,",
    "the velocity distribution of the electrons develops a bump as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the typical spectrum of one type ii and at least three type iii bursts . in the upper two plots one sees the energetic radiation recorded by the x - ray satellites goes and rhessi ( lin et al . [ 2002 ] ) . in the lower two plots one sees the dynamic radio spectra recorded by the observatory for solar radio astronomy ( osra ) of the astrophysical institut potsdam ( mann et al . [",
    "1992 ] ) and the wind satellite ( bougeret [ 1995 ] ) .",
    "the steep edge and the frequency drift of the radio emission from higher to lower frequencies is a prominent feature of type iii bursts which is most apparent in the wind spectrum . since the radio radiation originates from plasma oscillations the emission frequency",
    "is directly determined by the plasma density . the density and",
    "therefore the plasma frequency decreases with increasing distance to the sun due to the suns gravitation . consequently the radio radiation from radially propagating electrons drifts from higher to lower frequencies .",
    "this has been recorded for decades in osra radio spectra . with the new radio interferometer lofar ( low frequency array ) radio spectra of higher sensitivity and spectral",
    "resolution become available in the frequency range from 30 to 240 mhz .",
    "for example for spectroscopy the effective area increases from about 3 m@xmath3 to 96@xmath4 3 m@xmath3 and the spectral resolution improves from 300 to 3 khz .",
    "moreover lofar s imaging capabilities allow for the spatial resolution of burst propagation . so both instruments provide opportunities to study the spectra form type iii burst in more detail and allow to model the electron propagation based on the theoretical understanding . since electron propagation plays a key roll in space weather its understanding allows for more accurate space weather predictions which motivates further investigation .",
    "plasma emission occurs at the fundamental plasma frequency ( @xmath5 ) and / or its first harmonic ( @xmath6 ) ( melrose [ 1985 ] )    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the charge and mass of the electron and @xmath11 is the plasma s electron density .",
    "since all other parameters are physical constants , @xmath12 is a function of @xmath11 only .",
    "the drift rate @xmath13 is the frequency change @xmath12 over time @xmath14 . using equation ( [ eqn : f ] )",
    "one finds    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the radial distance from the center of the sun .",
    "consequently the term @xmath17 expresses a radial propagation velocity and will be abbreviated by @xmath2 . then rewriting equation ( [ eqn : df ] ) yields an expression for the radial propagation velocity    @xmath18    this equation shows , that measurements of the emission frequency and the drift rate as well as knowledge of the electron density of the interplanetary space allows to determine the radial propagation velocity @xmath2 of the radio radiation emitting electrons .",
    "drift rates can be determined quite accurately from dynamic radio spectra .",
    "a typical example is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mann ] which was taken from mann et al .",
    "it shows that the drift rate , which has been determined at the leading edge of the type iii burst signature , obeys the power - law    @xmath19    however , on small scales and in particular at higher frequencies above 80 mhz deviations from a power - law are possible .     using measurements from osra , wind and the ulysses satellite .",
    "the fit illustrates the power - law relation of equation ( [ eqn : power - law]).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "according to equation ( [ eqn : vr ] ) the heliospheric electron density is required for determining the radial propagation velocity @xmath2 from drift rate measurements .",
    "the electron density is directly proportional to the mass density of the interplanetary plasma @xmath20 since @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the proton mass and @xmath23 is the mean molecular weight ( priest [ 1982 ] ) . in the inner corona up to a distance of 1.6",
    "solar radii @xmath20 has been determined from optical measurements ( newkirk [ 1961 ] , koutchmy [ 1994 ] , warmuth et al .",
    ". from 0.3 to 1 au @xmath20 has been measured by the helios satellite ( schwenn [ 1990 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately it hasnt been measured in the region from 1.6 solar radii to 0.3 au .",
    "however , one can apply laws of physics to model the density there . for simplicity",
    "we neglect local density variations and consider mean radially symmetric models only . for example",
    "mann et al . [ 1999 ] have applied the parker [ 1958 ] wind model to data from the helios satellite to obtain an interplanetary density model .",
    "ansatz is the equation of motion @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath20 and @xmath26 are the mean particle mass , density , and velocity in radial direction @xmath16 , @xmath27 is the pressure , @xmath28 is the gravitational constant and @xmath29 is the solar mass .    here",
    "this model is extended by adding heat conduction as well as heating and pressure by alfvn waves as done by hackenberg et al . [ 2000 ] .",
    "heat conduction is added via the energy equation @xmath30=\\frac    1{r^2}\\frac { \\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r}\\left(r^2\\kappa_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}r}\\right)+h ,    \\label{eqn : energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath32 is the temperature , @xmath33 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath34 is the heating function by the alfvn waves . @xmath35 \\frac 1{\\omega_\\mathrm{h } } \\frac    { \\frac{v(r_\\odot)}{v_\\mathrm{a}(r_\\odot)}\\left(1+\\frac{v(r_\\odot)}{v_\\mathrm{a}(r_\\odot)}\\right)^2 }    { \\frac{v(r)}{v_\\mathrm{a}(r)}\\left(1+\\frac{v(r)}{v_\\mathrm{a}(r)}\\right)^2 }    \\frac{\\partial   \\omega_\\mathrm{h}}{\\partial r } ,    \\label{eqn : heating}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a pressure parameter , @xmath37 is the higher cut - off frequency , @xmath38 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath39 is the solar radius .",
    "the alfvn wave pressure @xmath40 adds the term @xmath41 to the momentum equation ( [ eqn : ofmotion ] ) , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the lower cut - off frequency .",
