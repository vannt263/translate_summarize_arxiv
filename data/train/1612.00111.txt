    "quantile regression is one of a popular alternative to mean regression when the data is non - normal , skewed or heteroscedastic .",
    "quantile regression is also useful when our objective is to make inferences about the population at different quantile levels .",
    "linear quantile regression was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "various other frequentist methods for quantile regression can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xcite first introduced the quantile regression using bayesian methods .",
    "later @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite proposed a few methods on generalization and extension of single level quantile regression under different possible scenarios .",
    "the main disadvantage of considering separate quantile regression using single level quantile regression is that the natural ordering among different quantiles can not be ensured . addressing the non - crossing issue",
    ", @xcite proposed a quantile regression method assuming the response variable to be heteroskedastic .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to estimate the quantile curve using linear interpolation from a estimated gird of quantile curves . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed non - crossing quantile regression methods using support vector machine ( svm , @xcite ) .",
    "later @xcite used doubly penalized kernal machine ( dpkm ) for estimating non - crossing quantile curves .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed quantile regression methods for a grid of quantiles addressing the monotonicity constraint .",
    "later @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite proposed linear quantile regression methods addressing the non - crossing issues .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite proposed simultaneous linear quantile regression methods for univariate explanatory variables .",
    "@xcite extended that simultaneous linear quantile regression method to handle multivariate predictor case .",
    "@xcite also extended the method proposed in @xcite in the spatio - temporal simultaneous quantile regression context where the response variable is assumed to be linearly dependent on one of the explanatory variables and varying non - parametrically with rest of the explanatory variables .",
    "one of the shortcomings of using linear quantile regression method is that it is not able to reveal a higher degree polynomial trend in the quantile curves .",
    "for example , while regressing household income data of a country over time , lower quantile levels maybe linear with time but the upper quantile levels may evolve very differently , for instance lower quantile level may increase linearly with time but upper quantile level may increase faster . in that case , using linear quantile regression will not be appropriate since it would only give the closest possible linear approximation of the quantile curves .",
    "quantile regression methods addressing this issue were proposed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the local linear quantile regression method based on the techniques proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed alternative methods of quantile regressions .",
    "a few other non - parametric quantile regression methods were proposed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided a detailed description of local linear quantile regression method using software r. alongside , he also proposed an alternative method called local spline quantile regression .    as long as non - linear quantile regression is concerned",
    ", most of the above - mentioned methods do not take care of the non - crossing issues .",
    "although , @xcite proposed a non - parametric quantile regression method addressing the non - crossing issue , it can only estimate a set of non - crossing curves for a given grid of quantiles and it does not estimate the whole quantile regression function . secondly ,",
    "the quantile regression estimates obtained by this method is sensitive to the number and location of chosen quantile grids . instead of estimating the quantile curves at a given set of quantiles ,",
    "it is more desirable to estimate the whole quantile curve simultaneously to emerge the broader picture .    in this paper",
    ", we propose two bayesian methods for quantile regression using b - spline . in the first method ,",
    "the entire quantile function is modeled by a b - spline series expansion . for each of the explanatory variables ,",
    "a corresponding b - spline basis function is considered .",
    "the whole quantile function is obtained via tensor product of b - spline basis functions corresponding to each dimension of explanatory variables and one corresponding to the quantile level .",
    "the prior on the b - spline coefficients is put in such a way that the monotonicity of the quantile curves is maintained .",
    "we name this method ` non - parametric simultaneous quantile regression ( npsqr ) ' . in the second method , instead of the quantile function",
    ", the conditional distribution function is estimated non - parametrically using b - spline basis expansion .",
    "similar to npsqr , in this method also , corresponding to each dimension of the explanatory variable , a b - spline basis is considered .",
    "again , the prior of the coefficients of the b - spline basis functions is put in such a way that the monotonicity of the distribution function is maintained . in this case",
    "also the whole distribution function is given by tensor product of the b - spline basis functions .",
    "the conditional distribution function is inverted to obtain the quantile regression function .",
    "the use of splines , which are piece - wise polynomials , allow efficient inversion through a combination of analytical and numerical technique .",
    "we name this method to be ` non - parametric distribution function simultaneous quantile regression ( npdfsqr ) ' .",
    "further using both of these two approaches , we propose the method of estimating the quantile curves when only the data with frequencies of the observations in each quantile range are available .",
    "suppose @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote the @xmath2-dimensional explanatory variable and the response variable respectively . using monotonic transformation , each coordinates of the explanatory variable and the response variable",
    "are transformed into unit interval .",
    "suppose @xmath3 denotes the conditional quantile function of @xmath4 given @xmath5 .",
    "a b - spline function of degree @xmath6 ( i.e. , degree of piece - wise polynomial is @xmath7 ) with knot sequence @xmath8 has @xmath9 basis functions .",
    "let @xmath10 denote b - spline basis functions of degree @xmath6 on the above - mentioned knot sequence . for simplicity",
    "we consider equidistant knots , i.e. , @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "hence the quantile function is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , are the coefficients of b - splines basis expansion of @xmath3 . thus in the above - mentioned equation it is noted that the coefficients of the basis functions used to expand the quantile function are dependent on the explanatory variable @xmath15 .",
    "secondly , the imposed monotonicity condition on the b - spline coefficients @xmath16 ensures the monotoniticy of the quantile levels ( @xcite ) .    now to put a prior , the functions @xmath16 , it is expanded using @xmath2-dimensional tensor product of the b - spline basis functions of degree @xmath17 .",
    "we use the knot sequence @xmath18 such that @xmath19 for all the coordinates of the explanatory variable @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 then the parameters which need to be estimated are given by @xmath22      for modeling the distribution function with b - spline basis functions , we adopt a similar technique .",
    "suppose @xmath23 denotes the conditional distribution function of @xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "suppose @xmath10 denotes the b - spline coefficients of degree @xmath6 on the knot sequence @xmath24 as mentioned earlier .",
    "then the conditional distribution @xmath23 is given by @xmath25 it is noted that again the coefficients @xmath26 are taken in such a way that the monotonicity of the distribution function is preserved . to put a prior on @xmath26",
    ", we use the same technique as mentioned in section [ npsqr_model ]",
    ". then @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 hence the parameters to be estimated are given by @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we describe the likelihood evaluation for both complete data and grouped data where only the frequencies of observations at each range of quantiles are given with the corresponding values of the explanatory variables .",
    "suppose that the explanatory and the response variables in the data are given by @xmath1 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the sample size and @xmath2 denotes the dimension of the explanatory variable .",
    "in the case of npsqr , the likelihood derived from the quantile function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 here @xmath35 solves the equation @xmath36 as described in section [ npsqr_model ] , @xmath37 is constructed in such a way that it is monotonically increasing in @xmath38 . hence equation has a unique solution . in case",
    "we consider piece - wise quadratic b - spline ( i.e. , @xmath6=2 ) , an advantage of our proposed method is that equation reduces to a quadratic equation and hence it can be solved analytically . solving it analytically provides the exact solution in lesser time . now to compute the likelihood , using the properties of derivative of b - spline ( @xcite ) , we get @xmath39 where @xmath40 thus the log - likelihood in case of npsqr is given by @xmath41 in case of npdfsqr , the log - likelihood function is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43      in the case of grid data suppose the partition of the quantiles of the response are given by @xmath44 and for each observation it is given between which two consecutive quantile divisions it belongs .",
    "define @xmath45 for @xmath46 . given the value of the explanatory variable for the @xmath47-th subject @xmath48 , the probability of an observation @xmath49 belonging between @xmath50 and @xmath51-th quantile is given by @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 denotes the @xmath54-th quantile @xmath55 of @xmath4 .",
    "hence the total likelihood is given by @xmath56 we assume that the values @xmath57 are provided and with @xmath58 , @xmath59 for all @xmath46 . now for npsqr , it should be noted that @xmath60 is the solution of the equation @xmath37@xmath61 since @xmath62 implies @xmath63 .",
    "hence @xmath60 can be obtained solving the following equation in terms of @xmath38 @xmath64 in case of npdfsqr , once the values of @xmath65 are evaluated , likelihood evaluation is straightforward and can be easily obtained using equation .",
    "to estimate the parameters for npsqr and npdfsqr methods ( given by equations and respectively ) we use block metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the parameter space which needs to be estimated are of the same form for npsqr and npdfsqr and hence we use the similar steps and same prior distribution for both the cases .",
    "recall that for npsqr the parameter space is given by @xmath66 now define @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "then it can be noted that @xmath69 belongs to the unit - simplex for any given @xmath68 since @xmath70for @xmath68 .",
    "we put the uniform prior on each simplex block .",
    "the number of simplex blocks is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the equidistant knot sequence used for each coordinate of the explanatory variables and @xmath17 is the degree of the piece - wise polynomials use for b - spline regression ( as mentioned in section [ npsqr_model ] ) . within an iteration",
    ", one simplex block is updated at a time .",
    "hence there will be @xmath71 updates performed one at a time during a single iteration .    to make movements on the simplex block",
    ", we use the same strategy as explained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first we fix @xmath68 .",
    "we generate independent sequence @xmath73 from @xmath74 for some @xmath75 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath76 works as a tuning parameter of the mcmc .",
    "smaller value of @xmath76 yields sticky movement with higher acceptance probability while larger value of @xmath76 would result in bigger jumps with less acceptance probability .",
    "define @xmath77 .",
    "hence the proposal move @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 the conditional distribution of @xmath80 given @xmath69 is given by ( see section [ section_mcmc_1 ] for the derivation ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 suppose @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the likelihood for npsqr ( either corresponding to complete data or quantile grid data ) for the parameter values @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "then a single block update for @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 denotes the uniform prior density .",
    "for npdfsqr we define @xmath91 for @xmath68 .",
    "hence in this case also the parameter space is given by a collection of @xmath71 simplex blocks .",
    "hence in case of npdfsqr ( for complete data and quantile grid data ) , the update steps are performed similar to that of npsqr ( as mentioned above ) . in this case also , inside each iteration step of mcmc , @xmath71 simplex blocks are updated one by one .      in case of very large parameter space , the strategy of warm - start in general helps in reducing the burn - in for metropolis - hastings mcmc . in the proposed method , instead of using a",
    "randomly generated starting point , we use the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) as the starting point . in section [ mcmc_here ]",
    ", it is noted that for both npsqr and npdfsqr methods , the parameter space is given by a collection of simplex blocks .",
    "one of the challenging aspect of finding mle under this scenario is that the parameter space is constrained and for npsqr , the likelihood function does not have any closed form .",
    "it is almost impossible to verify whether the negative of the likelihood of npsqr is convex or not ( in case negative likelihood is convex , there exists only one global maximum and convex optimization techniques can be used to find it ) .",
    "thus optimization should be performed assuming the possibility of existence of multiple local maximums of the likelihood function .",
    "secondly , due to the absence of a closed form likelihood in the case of npsqr , the derivative of the likelihood function does not have any closed form . in this case ,",
    "one of the disadvantages of using derivative based optimization methods is that derivatives can be evaluated only numerically which is computationally intensive .",
    "hence , this is an ideal scenario to use black - box optimization technique since black - box optimization technique does not use analytically derivative and is used to optimize any function with ( possibly ) multiple maximums or minimums .",
    "recently @xcite proposed an black - box optimization technique on a hyper - rectangular parameter space which has been shown to perform better ( in terms of computing time , accuracy and successful convergence ) than black - box optimization techniques genetic algorithm ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and simulated annealing ( @xcite , @xcite ) yielding better solutions .",
    "following that strategy , @xcite modified that algorithm to optimize any function on an unit simplex .",
    "later @xcite extended that method and proposed ` greedy coordinate descent of varying step sizes on multiple simplexes ' ( gcdvsms ) algorithm which efficiently minimizes ( or maximizes ) any black - box function of parameters given by a collection of unit simplex blocks .",
    "the main idea of the this algorithm is to make jumps of varying step - sizes within each unit simplex blocks parallelly and searching for the most favorable direction of movement .",
    "we use gcdvsms algorithm to find the warm starting point before initializing the mcmc .      as mentioned section [ mcmc_here ] ,",
    "@xmath76 plays a critical role in controlling the acceptance probability . instead of fixing the value of @xmath76",
    ", we propose an adaptive strategy so that during the mcmc iterations , acceptance probability is maintained within a desirable range of 0.15 to 0.45 .    for both npsqr and npdfsqr ,",
    "we start the first iteration with @xmath92 .",
    "it should be noted that in each iteration , @xmath71 simplex blocks are updated ; hence , @xmath71 acceptance - rejection decisions are taken .",
    "after each iteration , the cumulative acceptance ratio is calculated . at the end of an iteration ,",
    "if the cumulative acceptance probability drops below 0.15 , @xmath76 is updated to @xmath93 and if the cumulative acceptance probability goes above 0.45 , the value of @xmath76 is updated to @xmath94 .",
    "note that in this way , the value of @xmath76 will always be greater than 1 .",
    "for simulation purpose , we consider the following true models and we generate sample of sizes @xmath95 for each case .    1 .   *",
    "first simulation study :* we consider the explanatory variable @xmath96 in coming from @xmath97 .",
    "the dependence of the response variable @xmath4 on @xmath96 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 follows @xmath100 ( i.e. , skewed normal distribution with scale parameter 4 , mean 0 and standard deviation 1 ) .",
    "* second simulation study :* we consider the explanatory variable @xmath96 in coming from @xmath101 .",
    "the dependence of the response variable @xmath4 on @xmath96 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 follows discrete uniform @xmath104 and @xmath99 follows gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters 5 and 1 respectively .      for each of the cases given by equation ( [ sim_1_eq ] ) and ( [ sim_2_eq ] ) ,",
    "the quantiles are estimated using non - parametric simultaneous quantile regression ( npsqr ) , non - parametric distribution function simultaneous quantile regression ( npdfsqr ) , local linear quantile regression ( llqr ) and local spline quantile regression ( lsqr ) ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ for npsqr and npdfsqr , first the explanatory variable and the response variables are transformed into unit interval separately by linear transformation .",
    "we use piece - wise quadratic b - spline for expanding both the quantile function as well as the explanatory variable ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) . one of the biggest advantage of quadratic b - spline is that equations and reduce to quadratic equation which can be solved analytically very easily .",
    "suppose @xmath24 and @xmath72 denote the equidistant knots on unit interval such that @xmath106 in case of npsqr , for b - spline expansion , we consider @xmath24 and @xmath72 knot sequences for expanding the quantile function and transformed explanatory variable respectively .",
    "we consider @xmath107 and choose the best model using the akaike information criteria ( aic ) criterion .",
    "for npdfsqr , suppose that knot sequences @xmath24 and @xmath72 are used for expanding the distribution function and transformed explanatory variable respectively .",
    "for npdfsqr , it is noted that taking @xmath108 , yields poorly estimated posterior quantile curves under different simulation studies .",
    "the possible reason is that in case of npdfsqr , a lot of estimated b - spline coefficients ( which are used to estimate the distribution function of the response variable ) are coming to be nearly zero which might be an indicator of usage of less number of knots to represent the variability of the distribution function .",
    "therefore , for npdfsqr , we omit the cases @xmath108 and consider the cases @xmath109 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we consider bayesian methods for non - parametric quantile regressions with multiple continuous predictors ranging values in the unit interval . in the first method , the quantile function </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to be smooth over the explanatory variable and is expanded in tensor product of b - spline basis functions . while in the second method , the distribution function is assumed to be smooth over the explanatory variable and is expanded in tensor product of b - spline basis functions . unlike other existing methods of non - parametric quantile regressions , the proposed methods estimate the whole quantile function instead of estimating on a grid of quantiles . </S>",
    "<S> priors on the b - spline coefficients are put in such a way that the monotonicity of the estimated quantile levels are maintained unlike local polynomial quantile regression methods . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed methods have also been modified for quantile grid data where only the percentile range of each response observations are known . </S>",
    "<S> simulations studies have been provided for both complete and quantile grid data . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method has been used to estimate the quantiles of us household income data and north atlantic hurricane intensity data .    * * keywords:**b - spline prior ; block metropolis - hastings ; non - parametric quantile regression ; north atlantic hurricane data ; us household income data </S>"
