    "to ease the following discussions , we first recall the basic definitions and relations of the three distinct nucleon effective masses used typically in non - relativistic descriptions of nuclear matter and give a few examples of model predictions .    the k - mass @xmath3 and e - mass @xmath1 of a nucleon @xmath4 characterizes , respectively , the space and time non - locality of nuclear interactions .",
    "they are normally obtained from the momentum and energy dependence of the single - nucleon potential @xmath5 in nucleonic matter of density @xmath6 and isospin asymmetry @xmath7 via @xcite @xmath8^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the average mass of nucleons in free - space . once an energy - momentum dispersion relation is assumed using the on - shell condition @xmath10 , an equivalent single - particle potential either local in space or time",
    "can be obtained .",
    "the so - called total effective mass @xmath0 @xmath11^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is then used to characterize equivalently either the momentum or energy dependence of the single - nucleon potential .",
    "we emphasize that once nucleons are put on shell , the total effective mass is the only effective mass one can extract from either the first or the second part of the above equation .",
    "as we shall discuss later , one then has to use other approaches to evaluate the e - mass and k - mass .",
    "the total effective mass is a measure of the energy level density . the well - known relationship @xmath12 among the three kinds of nucleon effective masses can be derived by noticing that @xcite @xmath13 in the above , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the nucleon fermi momentum in symmetric nuclear matter at density @xmath6 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 for neutrons or protons .",
    "many microscopic many - body theories using various interactions have been used in calculating all three kinds of nucleonic effective masses , see , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ muther ] and fig .",
    "[ baldo ] are examples of brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) predictions of the e - mass , k - mass and total effective mass of neutrons and protons in asymmetric nuclear matter using some of the most widely used nuclear interactions .",
    "the recent focus of many studies has been on the splitting of the neutron - proton effective masses and its dependence on the isospin asymmetry and density of the neutron - rich medium encountered in heavy - ion collisions and in some astrophysical situations @xcite , such as in neutron stars and neutrino spheres of supernova explosions .",
    "a thorough understanding of the nucleon effective masses is critical for us to better understand many interesting issues in both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "generally , most of the models predict that in neutron - rich medium , neutrons have a k - mass and total effective mass higher than those for protons , and protons have a higher e - mass than neutrons at their respective fermi surfaces .",
    "however , depending on the models and interactions used , the predictions can change dramatically .",
    "for example , some of the widely used skyrme interactions predict that protons have a higher total effective mass than neutrons in neutron - rich matter .",
    "thus , it is very important to extract reliable information about the nucleon effective masses from experiments @xcite . while conclusions from recent analyses of heavy - ion experiments using transport models are still quite ambiguous even about the sign of the neutron - proton total effective mass splitting @xcite , it is very encouraging that analyses of nucleon - nucleus and electron - nucleus scatterings can constrain clearly at least the sign of the neutron - proton total and e - mass splitting , respectively , at saturation densities @xcite . in this talk",
    ", we shall briefly review theses results and then infer from them the neutron - proton k - mass splitting at saturation density . for more details",
    ", please see the original publications in refs .",
    "@xcite .     from a bhf calculation by baldo",
    "et al . in ref .",
    "assuming the energy on - shell condition has been used , then the single - nucleon potential can be written as a function of momentum k , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the latter is the well - known lane potential that can be expanded as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the isoscalar and isovector potential , respectively .",
    "the neutron - proton effective mass splitting @xmath22 can be written as @xcite @xmath23\\left[1+\\frac{m_n}{\\hbar^2k_f^n}\\frac{du_n}{dk}\\mid_{k_f^n}\\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to the first - order in isospin asymmetry parameter @xmath24 , the above expression can be further simplified to @xmath25_{k_f}\\left(\\frac{m^*_0}{m}\\right)^2.\\ ] ] generally , the @xmath26 depends on the momentum dependence of both the isovector @xmath27 and isoscalar @xmath28 potentials .",
    "interestingly , the same factors also determine the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the latter is currently the most uncertain part of the equation of state of neutron - rich matter and has significant implications for many areas of both nuclear physics and astrophysics , see , e.g. , ref .",

    "have been expressed as @xcite @xmath30 we emphasize here that the isoscalar effective mass @xmath31 enters explicitly the above expressions for both the magnitude and slope of the symmetry energy .",
    "thus , there is no surprise at all that some transport model simulations have indicated that isospin - tracers and observables sensitive to the symmetry energy , such as the isospin diffusion and neutron / proton ratio of energetic nucleons in heavy - ion collisions , are also affected by the isoscalar nucleon effective mass .",
    "moreover , the study of the isospin dependence of nucleon effective masses and the symmetry energy are intrinsically correlated by the same underlying interaction . in fact , by neglecting the contributions of the momentum dependence of the isoscalar effective mass itself and the second - order symmetry ( isoscalar @xmath32 term ) potential , the neutron - proton effective mass splitting can be readily expressed in terms of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xcite @xmath35 it is interesting to note that the @xmath36 is equal , larger or smaller than the @xmath37 depends on the symmetry energy and its slope .",
    "for example , using empirical values of 0=31 mev , @xmath38 and @xmath39 mev , a value of 0@xmath40 mev is required to get a positive @xmath41 interestingly , most of the extracted values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 from both terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations satisfy this condition @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in the examples shown in figs .",
    "[ muther ] and [ baldo ] , nucleon effective masses are strongly density / momentum dependent , especially for the e - masses near the fermi momenta . ultimately , one has to find ways using , such as observables in heavy - ion collisions and/or neutron star observables , to probe the entire density / momentum dependences of all kinds of nucleon effective masses .",
    "interestingly , nucleon - nucleus and electron - nucleus scattering data accumulated over several decades have already been used to constrain , respectively , the total effective mass and the e - mass at saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "these provide important boundaries for the nucleon effective masses and may be used already to constrain some of the models and the interactions .",

    "we summarize here the main findings of a global optical model analysis @xcite of all 2249 data sets of reaction and angular differential cross sections of neutron and proton scattering on 234 targets at beam energies from 0.05 to 200 mev available in the exfor database at the brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite . shown on the left of fig .",
    "3 is a comparison of the nucleon isoscalar @xmath45 potentials from this analysis ( hatched bands ) @xcite and the schr@xmath46dinger equivalent isoscalar potential obtained earlier by hama _ et al . _",

    "@xcite that the total effective mass of neutrons is larger than that of protons in neutron - rich matter .",
    "moreover , a recent analysis of giant resonances in @xmath49pb  @xcite also found a value of @xmath50 consistent with this result .",
    "the e - mass is related to the lifetime of quasi - particles in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the migdal - luttinger theorem@xcite connects the nucleon e - mass directly with the discontinuity @xmath51 of the single - nucleon momentum distribution @xmath52 at the fermi momentum @xmath53 illustrated in fig .",

    "the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath57 depend linearly on @xmath24 according to @xmath61 as indicated by microscopic many - body theories @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath62 and the cutoff coefficient @xmath60 determine the fraction of nucleons above the fermi surface . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , except the @xmath57 , all other parameters are constrained by experiments measuring the strength and isospin - dependence of nuclear short range correlations ( src ) using electron - nucleus scattering at the jefferson national laboratory , see , e.g. , @xcite , and applying tan s adiabatic swipe theorem @xcite to the equation of state of pure neutron matter calculated using the state - of - the - art microscopic theories @xcite .    for symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) , @xmath63 was extracted using the migdal - luttinger theorem from the constrained phenomenological momentum distribution @xcite . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - emass0 ] is a comparison of this value in comparison with earlier predictions using ( 1 ) a semi - realistic parametrization through a relative s - wave exponential nucleon - nucleon interaction potential ( red dash line)@xcite , ( 2 ) a green s function method considering collective effects due to the coupling of nucleons with the low - lying particle - hole excitations of the medium ( green solid line)@xcite , ( 3 ) a correlated basis function ( cbf ) method using the reid and bethe - johnson potentials ( black and magenta solid lines)@xcite , ( 4 ) two non - relativistic models with the paris nuclear potential ( purple and red solid line)@xcite , ( 5 ) a low density expansion of the optical potential ( orange solid line)@xcite and ( 6 ) a relativistic dirac - brueckner approach ( dash black line)@xcite , within the uncertain range of the @xmath64 parameter .",
    "it is seen that the variation of @xmath65 with @xmath64 is rather small . clearly , the predictions are rather diverse .",

    "taken from ref.@xcite . ]    in isospin asymmetric matter , the neutron - proton e - mass splitting generally can be expanded in terms of @xmath24 as @xmath68 where the @xmath69 and @xmath66 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - splitting ] within the uncertainty range of the @xmath67-parameter describing the isospin and momentum dependence of the nucleon fermi surface .",
    "it is interesting to note that the neutron e - mass is smaller than the proton e - mass , i.e. , @xmath70 in neutron - rich medium .",
    "however , the neutron - proton e - mass splitting suffers from the large uncertainties due to the poorly known @xmath67-parameter .",
    "to improve the situation , one needs to have more reliable knowledge about the isospin dependence of the nucleon momentum distribution around the fermi surface .",
    "this information may be obtained from experiments measuring the isospin dependence of the nucleon spectroscopic factors and the src strength in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "with the information about the total effective mass and e - mass , we can infer information about the k - mass from the relation of eq .",
    "[ metk ] . in terms of the reduced mass ,",
    "i.e. , the dimensionless mass m ( @xmath71 divided by @xmath9 , etc ) , we have @xcite @xmath72 similarly , the linear splitting function @xmath73 for the total effective mass can be obtained from the nucleon - nucleus scattering data as discussed in section [ sec.iii ] .",
    "[ metk ] then leads to @xmath74 using @xmath75 and @xmath76 we notice that the value of @xmath77 is significantly smaller than the empirical value of about 0.6 given in refs .",
    "the value of @xmath78 indicates that the k - mass has a significant isospin dependence compared to that of the total effective mass .",
    "the positive values of both @xmath73 and @xmath78 indicate that the total effective mass and the k - mass of neutrons ( protons ) increase ( decrease ) with the isospin asymmetry @xmath24 , while it is the opposite for the e - mass of nucleons .",
    "the inferred values of the k - mass in snm , its splitting for neutrons and protons and their dependence on the isospin asymmetry of the medium have interesting implications .",
    "for example , the k - mass affects the nucleon mfp @xmath79 and it was found necessary to explain qualitatively the observed large values of @xmath79 for protons in snm @xcite .",
    "it was emphasized that the space non - locality is as important as the pauli blocking in determining the mfp .",
    "in fact , it was shown quantitatively that estimates using the well - known expression @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the isospin averaged in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross section can not reproduce the experimental observations even if the pauli blocking is considered unless the space non - locality through @xmath82 is also considered .",
    "more specifically , the mfp @xmath79 in nuclear medium is determined by @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84^{1/2}$ ] is the real part of the nucleon momentum and @xmath85 is the imaginary part of the potential . a reduced k - mass increases the nucleon mfp . since the symmetry potential is repulsive ( attractive ) and the k - mass increases ( decreases ) for neutrons ( protons ) , the @xmath86 factor increases ( decreases ) for protons ( neutrons ) with the same energy as the isospin asymmetry @xmath24 increases .",
    "while existing analyses of nucleon - nucleus reaction data has not firmly established the isospin dependence of the imagine optical potential , recent many - body perturbation theory using chiral effective forces has clearly verified the lane form of the imaginary potential @xcite .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the isovecor part of the imaginary potential is appreciable compared to that of the real potential for nucleon energies below about 200 mev . obviously , whether protons have longer mfp than neutrons in neutron - rich medium depends on the isospin dependence of all three factors determining the @xmath79 in eq .",
    "previously , using a relativistic impulse approximation without considering the space non - locality it was found that neutrons have a longer mfp than protons with kinetic energies less than about 600 mev , while it is the opposite at higher kinetic energies @xcite . in another study using a kinetic model considering the isospin dependence of both the pauli blocking and nucleon - nucleon cross sections , but not the space - time non - locality necessary to reproduce the experimental observations @xcite , it was found that neutrons always have longer mfp than protons @xcite .",
    "more recently , using the definitions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections calculated within the dbhf approach , neutrons are found to have longer mfp than protons at kinetic energies less than about 300 mev and the effect increases with the isospin asymmetry . at higher energies",
    ", however , neutrons and protons have approximately the same mfp @xcite .",
    "thus , overall , we are still seeing rather model dependent predictions regarding the isospin and energy dependence of the nucleon mfp in neutron - rich matter while significant progress has been made in recent years .",
    "further progress requires more complete knowledge about the isospin dependence of nucleon k - mass and its imaginary potential in neutron - rich matter .",
    "in summary , due to the space - time non - locality of nuclear interactions single - nucleon potentials are momentum and/or energy dependent .",
    "three distinct nucleon effective masses are normally used to character the momentum / energy dependence of nucleon potentials .",
    "how do they depend on the density and isospin asymmetry of the medium ? how are they different for neutrons and protons ?",
    "these have been among the longstanding questions in nuclear physics .",
    "answers to these questions have many interesting ramifications in both nuclear physics and astrophysics . in this talk",
    ", we briefly reviewed some of our recent efforts to answer these questions .",
    "in particular , we showed that the total effective mass @xmath0 for neutrons is higher than that for protons in neutron - rich matter at saturation density based on a comprehensive analysis of existing nucleon - nucleus scattering data . while the e - mass @xmath1 for neutrons is less than that for protons in neutron - rich matter from applying the migdal - luttinger theorem to a phenomenological single - nucleon momentum distribution in nuclei constrained by recent electron - nucleus scattering experiments . combining information about the isospin dependence of both the nucleon total effective mass and e - mass , we inferred the isospin dependence of nucleon k - mass .",
