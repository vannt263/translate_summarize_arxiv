    "<S> in contrast with the @xmath0 quark case , the absolute value of the @xmath1 quark contribution in full qcd is larger than that in the valence case . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the disconnected contribution and hence the strange quark form factor being small and negative . at the physical pion mass , the quenched ( @xmath82 ) , valence ( @xmath83 ) and full qcd ( @xmath84 ) values of the @xmath1 quark contribution </S>",

    "<S> , one can get the strange form factor by subtraction them from the proton or neutron magnetic form factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the small value of @xmath61 , the error bar obtained in this direct calculation is much larger than the central value of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore use the valence contributions , @xmath77 and @xmath83 , which yield a relatively precise value of @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> the proton and neutron magnetic form factors can be written in terms of quark components as  @xcite @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the label @xmath91 denotes a `` loop '' or sea quark contribution , while the label @xmath92 means a connected valence quark contribution in @xmath93 qcd . in the equations above , charge symmetry has been used  </S>",

    "<S> then , using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ magp ] ) and ( [ magn ] ) , we find @xmath100 @xmath101 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , since we were working at @xmath102 , it was possible to use the measured magnetic moments of the nucleon and the hyperons . </S>",
    "<S> since the hyperon magnetic form factors are not known at finite @xmath103 , here we must use the extrapolated valence quark contributions ( rather than ratios ) to extract the strange form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are @xmath106  @xcite and @xmath107  @xcite , where @xmath108 is the dipole function expressed as @xmath109gev@xmath110 . substituting the experimental magnetic moment of the proton ( 2.793 ) and neutron ( @xmath111 ) </S>",

    "<S> we note that the two extracted values of @xmath61 are consistent within their respective error bars and that the sign of both , negative , is consistent with the difference between the extrapolations of the single quark magnetic moments in the valence and full qcd cases in figs .  3 and 4 .    ) . ]    </S>",

    "<S> the latter led to a much smaller contribution to the final error on @xmath61 than the statistical errors on the lattice qcd data . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case here at small but finite @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the dominance piece of the error which we quote to @xmath116 arises from the errors on the lattice determination of @xmath83 and the experimental errors on proton and neutron magnetic form factors , in comparison with which the errors expected from all that is known about charge symmetry breaking in nuclear physics , namely that it is typically below 1% , really are negligible ) is much larger than the usual one - boson exchange omega - n coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the implications of this work for other examples of charge symmetry violation have not yet been worked out . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> if we were to use their extreme estimate , our result for @xmath116 would change from @xmath123 to @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is very small and in view of the concerns already noted we prefer not to include this estimate of the charge symmetry correction in our final result . ] .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have extrapolated the lattice results for the separate valence quark contributions to the proton magnetic form factor at @xmath2 gev@xmath3 in quenched and full heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the leading and next - to - leading order diagrams are considered and all octet and decuplet baryons are included in the intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> finite - range regularisation is used in the one loop calculation , both because it improves the convergence of the chiral expansion and because it has been shown to permit a connection between quenched and dynamical lattice results  @xcite . by using the constraints of charge symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> we combine the extrapolated @xmath1 valence quark contribution with the experimental proton and neutron magnetic form factors to obtain a surprisingly accurate determination of the strange magnetic form factor @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time it has proven possible to extract an accurate value of the strange magnetic form factor at @xmath2 gev@xmath3 using lattice qcd results . </S>",
    "<S> it will clearly be of considerable interest to compare this with the values which will be extracted from the recent a4 and g0 measurements at mainz and jlab . ] . </S>"
