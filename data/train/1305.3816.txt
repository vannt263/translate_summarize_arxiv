    "studies of the current - phase relation ( cpr ) in a josephson junction , where a weak link connects two superconductors with phase difference @xmath2 , have provided ever new surprises over the past fifty years.@xcite nowadays , josephson junctions showing novel and rich behavior can be formed by sandwiching a nanoscale conductor  collectively referred to as quantum dot below , e.g. , a semiconductor dot or nanowire , or a single molecule  between two superconductors.@xcite the interest in such nanoscale hybrid devices has sharply increased recently due to technological advances , allowing to fabricate and manipulate well - characterized setups and raising the hope for new applications , as well as by the prospect of realizing majorana fermions . to mention",
    "just a few key experiments , gate - tunable supercurrents through the two - dimensional electron gas in semiconductors have been demonstrated,@xcite the cpr of superconducting atomic point contacts has been measured using a loop geometry,@xcite and the direct spectroscopy of andreev bound states in carbon nanotube devices was reported.@xcite the phenomena studied below will be particularly pronounced for strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the nanoscale conductor .",
    "note that strong soc is naturally present in inas or insb,@xcite and in self - assembled sige quantum dots.@xcite soc is often responsible for nontrivial topological properties and the emergence of majorana fermions in very similar settings.@xcite majoranas have attracted wide attention after recent experiments reported first transport signatures such as those expected for majorana fermions.@xcite    in this paper , we study a general model for the equilibrium josephson current through a multi - level quantum dot tunnel - contacted by two conventional @xmath1-wave bcs superconductors with phase difference @xmath2 and superconducting gap @xmath7 . our dot hamiltonian @xmath8 ,",
    "see eq .   below",
    ", takes into account arbitrary soc terms , magnetic ( orbital and zeeman ) field effects , and coulomb charging interactions .",
    "moreover , the tunnel contacts are described by a general tunneling hamiltonian @xmath9 , see eq .",
    "below , allowing for inter - orbital phase shifts and asymmetric contacts .",
    "our analysis is mostly devoted to two complementary regimes where analytical progress is possible , namely the cotunneling regime , realized for weak tunneling , and the deep subgap regime ( atomic limit ) , where @xmath7 represents the largest energy scale .",
    "we explore in detail the ground - state josephson cpr , @xmath0 , which can reveal two particularly interesting phenomena in such a setting , namely the anomalous josephson effect and majorana bound states ( mbss ) .",
    "the anomalous josephson effect is characterized by a finite supercurrent flowing at zero phase difference , @xmath10 . comparing to the conventional josephson relation , @xmath11 with critical current @xmath12 , this is equivalent to a @xmath13 phase shift , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "junctions with @xmath15 are thus commonly referred to as @xmath13-junctions , where soc is typically a crucial ingredient .",
    "the josephson cpr for quantum dots with soc has been studied in many theoretical works,@xcite and the conditions for @xmath13-junction behavior have been clarified in the noninteracting case.@xcite in contrast to the widely known @xmath16- and @xmath17-junctions,@xcite where @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , a general @xmath13-junction can have direction - dependent critical currents,@xcite i.e. , @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] are different .",
    "the @xmath13-junction can thus act as a phase battery@xcite or as superconducting rectifier,@xcite promising novel device applications .",
    "while it is well - established@xcite and also experimentally observed@xcite that spin - active interfaces , e.g. , for a ferromagnetic dot region , allow one to realize a @xmath13-junction , we here focus on semiconducting or molecular systems with spin - conserving and spin - independent interfaces , where @xmath13-junction behavior is quite nontrivial .",
    "@xmath13-junctions were also predicted but never observe in unconventional superconductors.@xcite    so far , the necessary conditions for anomalous supercurrents have only been determined for noninteracting dots , where one needs finite soc and a suitably oriented magnetic field .",
    "in addition , asymmetric tunnel contacts with non - commuting hybridization matrices , @xmath22 , are required .",
    "this imposes a chirality condition which is necessary to have @xmath15 , see ref .   and sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] below .",
    "we find that the coulomb charging energy @xmath23 does not change these necessary conditions , but it can be responsible for a dramatic enhancement of the anomalous supercurrent . the most interesting enhancement is related to an interaction - induced behavior with @xmath5 for arbitrarily weak time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking field @xmath4 .",
    "such a behavior suggests that trs is spontaneously broken .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations can suppress @xmath24 , and we therefore interpret this enhancement of @xmath24 compared to the usual noninteracting behavior,@xcite @xmath25 , as incipient spontaneously broken trs .",
    "this effect generally happens whenever two @xmath26 kramer s partner states contribute with opposite sign to @xmath24 .",
    "a small magnetic field then lifts the degeneracy , while the coulomb interactions create a gap and effectively project away the higher energy state . as a consequence , interaction - induced enhancement is especially pronounced for small @xmath4 and if @xmath23 exceeds all other energy scales of interest .",
    "concrete parameter regimes where this effect occurs will be discussed in sec .",
    "we mention in passing that spontaneously broken trs was also reported in a recent mean - field study@xcite for a single - level anderson dot between a two - band ( @xmath27 ) and a single - band ( @xmath1-wave ) superconductor . however",
    ", this effect can be traced back to phase frustration@xcite and strongly differs from our scenario .",
    "technically related works have also studied the supercurrent in the cotunneling regime for dots coupled to a local phonon mode@xcite and to a two - level system.@xcite other studies of the josephson effect for interacting double dots have either disregarded soc@xcite or did not address the phenomena investigated here.@xcite    besides analyzing the anomalous supercurrent , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we also address the possibility of mbs formation in an interacting double dot with soc and zeeman field .",
    "the double dot is contained as special case in our general multi - level hamiltonian , and our theory is directly applicable to such a two - orbital case with well separated orbitals .",
    "majorana fermions are emergent quasi - particles that equal their own antiparticle .",
    "they are of much interest in the context of topological quantum computation.@xcite when our dot region corresponds to a semiconductor nanowire , one effectively can realize kitaev s chain model which ( in the right parameter regime ) allows for a pair of topologically protected mbss localized near the nanowire ends.@xcite ( topological protection implies that small parameter changes not closing a bulk gap can not remove the mbss . )",
    "as discussed by lejinse and flensberg,@xcite see also refs .",
    ", a simpler variant , albeit with topologically unprotected majorana fermions , can be realized for two coulomb - blockaded single - level dots coupled to a superconductor .",
    "similarly , in our setting a pair of spatially separated mbss can also be realized .",
    "remarkably , these majoranas could be detected through the highly unusual features in the @xmath6-periodic cpr described below .",
    "the structure of the remainder of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , a general model for the s - dot - s hybrid structure is introduced .",
    "we allow for arbitrary single - particle hamiltonians in the dot region , and take into account coulomb charging effects . integrating out the noninteracting fermions in the superconducting electrodes , we arrive at an effective partition function expressed in terms of dot variables only , which then allows to extract the josephson cpr by a phase derivative . for concrete results ,",
    "we employ a generic two - orbital dot with a zeeman field and ( rashba or dresselhaus ) soc . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we discuss the two approaches used in this work .",

    "finally , we offer some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "we often use units with @xmath31 .",
    "we study a general model describing the josephson effect in a large variety of interacting nanostructures , where a central region ( dot ) is tunnel - coupled to two conventional @xmath1-wave superconducting leads , @xmath32 . following standard",
    "arguments,@xcite we take into account coulomb interactions , soc , and magnetic field effects only on the dot , but not in the bulk electrodes nor in the tunnel contact . for @xmath33 relevant ( spin - degenerate ) electronic orbitals in the central dot region ,",
    "the dot hamiltonian is taken in the form @xmath34 where the operator @xmath35 creates a dot electron in a single - particle state with orbital quantum number @xmath36 and spin projection @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 hermitian matrix @xmath39 encapsulates the single - particle content , including soc and magnetic field effects . at this stage",
    ", we make no assumptions about the soc , allowing for rather general statements regarding the anomalous josephson effect .",
    "importantly , the @xmath40 matrix can always be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , @xmath41 , with the single - particle energies @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we then have associated fermionic operators , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 which correspond to single - particle eigenstates of the isolated dot .",
    "the @xmath46 operators instead will be taken to represent dot fermion modes tunnel - coupled to the leads .",
    "both representations are , of course , equivalent , and the benefits of using the @xmath44 should become clear below . after the unitary transformation , @xmath47 the capacitive coulomb charging term is only sensitive to the total dot fermion number operator , @xmath48 where the charging energy , @xmath23 , sets the energy cost for adding or removing electrons .",
    "the real number @xmath49 is proportional to a backgate voltage and regulates the average number of electrons on the dot .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the above charging term generically describes the dominant interaction contribution.@xcite for later use , we also define the coulomb energy differences @xmath50 ( integer @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 where the integer @xmath53 denotes the ground - state electron number on the dot .",

    "while jumps in the cpr can also have a different origin , the peculiar feature linked to the appearance of mbs pairs is the complete vanishing of the supercurrent in a finite phase interval . for the asymmetric case shown in the lower inset of fig .",

    "finally , it is worthwhile pointing out that in contrast to the fractional josephson effect for topologically protected majoranas,@xcite the mbss discussed here do not mediate a josephson current themselves .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed two particularly interesting aspects of josephson transport in hybrid superconductor - dot systems  a pair of conventional bcs superconductors connected through a multi - level quantum dot  where soc , coulomb charging and magnetic field effects are taken into account .",
    "first , we have studied the conditions for the anomalous josephson effect , i.e. , supercurrent flow for vanishing phase difference .",

    "[ sec4 ] , we find spontaneously broken time - reversal symmetry with anomalous supercurrent flowing for arbitrarily weak zeeman fields .",
    "second , in the deep subgap case , we have determined the conditions for observing a pair of topologically unprotected yet spatially separated majorana bound states in a double dot .",
    "the formation of such exotic particles is presently under vigorous study and could be indirectly detected in the cpr through the critical phases @xmath2 , where the current switches from a finite value to zero .",
