    "a good knowledge of the _ local _ ( @xmath6 ) qlf is essential for at least two purposes : first , to serve as zero - point for quasar evolution studies ; second , to provide a reference distribution law for unbiased subsamples constructed for statistical investigations ( e.g. , for spectral properties , host galaxies , etc ) .",
    "unfortunately , current determinations of the qlf are limited mainly to @xmath7 , for the simple reason of lacking appropriate survey data .",

    "these small - aperture magnitudes correlated also well with the corresponding s / n ratios of the digital spectra , important for an accurate definition of limiting magnitudes .    in a second step",

    "were shifted to the system of the corresponding photographic plate by using surrounding unsaturated field stars as references .",
    "the resulting corrected ccd magnitudes , again measured in an aperture of diameter approximately equal to that of the seeing disk , should be much more accurate than the photographic data , at least for extended objects , while magnitudes of point sources should be more or less unchanged .",
    "we tested this assertion by comparing photographic and zero - point corrected ccd photometry of the @xmath39 qsos ( which should be true point sources ) and found a mean difference of only 0.01mag .",
    "for the further analysis we used the zero - point corrected @xmath17 band ccd magnitudes . for three objects no ccd data were available , and for those we substituted the photographic measurements ( cf .",

    ", we conducted a dedicated subsurvey for seyfert galaxies , targeting both type  1 and type  2 objects .",
    "the criteria were different from those used in the main survey , adapted to discriminate between active and inactive galaxies rather than between stars and qsos .",
    "more details about this subsurvey will be given in a later paper ( khler et al .",

    "the redshifts were remeasured in new spectra obtained with the eso 1.52  m telescope , and corrected for heliocentric motion .",

    "for these sources , proper photometry is at least as important as for qsos .",
    "the photometric systems of many earlier investigations of the luminosity function of seyferts suffer from two severe drawbacks : ( i ) they were often based on heterogeneous collections of published ( aperture ) photometry , generally inconsistent with the magnitudes used for defining the survey flux limits .",
    "( ii ) the contributions of host galaxies were either not corrected for at all , or some assumptions about universal intrinsic properties of hosts and nuclei had to be made , such as colours ( sandage @xcite ) or host luminosities ( cheng et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the assumption that seyfert  1 galaxies are the low - luminosity equivalent of quasars , the quantity of interest is the _ nuclear _ brightness , with the host galaxy contribution removed . although our small - aperture magnitudes were already much less affected by galaxy contamination than large - aperture or total brightness measurements , a major contribution could still be expected especially for the lowest nuclear luminosities .",
    "we therefore estimated these corrections individually , based on @xmath17 and @xmath41 images of the seven sample objects taken with the eso 90 cm telescope .",
    "we first constructed empirical two - dimensional point - spread functions from nearby stars .",
    "these were then subtracted from the seyfert images , scaled by a factor chosen such that the residual galaxy surface brightness distribution did not decrease inwards . the resulting host galaxy brightness was finally integrated over the aperture and subtracted from the total aperture flux . as can be seen in table  [ tab : seyferts ] , the corrections were not negligible , and  expectedly ",
    "largest for the lowest redshift sources .",
    "an important diagnostic tool for qso samples is the empirical relation between source fluxes and the number of sources per unit solid angle .",
    "once the field properties and the sample photometry are complete , the cumulative surface density of qsos brighter than magnitude @xmath17 , @xmath42 , can be easily computed from summing over @xmath43 for all relevant sample objects . from our qso sample with @xmath44 ( 47 objects ) we have derived the @xmath42 relation shown as thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfdens ] . note that the abscissa values in this diagram are extinction - corrected magnitudes .",
    "the bright end of the curve is dominated by the extremely luminous source he  1029@xmath201401 , but the main part can be well approximated by a simple power law of slope @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . if only the 33 sources with @xmath47 are considered , excluding thereby all qso / seyfert borderline cases ( thin line in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfdens ] ) , the normalisation drops slightly but the slope is essentially unchanged with @xmath48 . for those readers who prefer differential surface densities ,",
    "we have computed the figures in half magnitude bins between @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( table  [ tab : surfdens ] ) .",
    "the counts were multiplied by a factor of 2 to formally express number counts per unit magnitude intervals .",
    "comparison relations from other surveys are numerous for fainter magnitudes , but rare for @xmath51 . the palomar bright quasar survey ( bqs ; schmidt & green @xcite , hereafter quoted as sg83 ) provides the only available optically selected qso sample with a well - defined flux limit subtending over a similar region in the hubble diagram .",

    "one can estimate globally that an average @xmath15(bqs ) of 0.61mag would be necessary to bring bqs and he s surface densities to a match  a totally unrealistic value .    at fainter magnitudes",

    "similarly good agreement is reached with other surveys , cf .  the recent compilation by cristiani et al .",
    "we are thus confident that the photometric scale used in the present investigation is essentially unbiased and adequate for luminosity function work .",
    "for all objects in table  [ tab : qsos ] , we first estimated absolute magnitudes for the rest - frame @xmath17 band by computing their luminosity distances in an expanding friedmann universe with the formula of terrell ( @xcite ) , and applying @xmath62 corrections taken from cristiani & vio ( @xcite ) .",
    "as low - redshift subsample we selected the 20 qsos with @xmath1 .",
    "space densities were derived using the generalised @xmath63 estimator ( felten @xcite ; avni & bahcall @xcite ) , thus incorporating the full information about field - dependent flux limits , including fields with zero detections ( the ` coherent ' analysis in the terminology of avni & bahcall ) .",

    "we have chosen the cumulative representation @xmath64 as it allows one to avoid binning ( particularly problematic for smaller samples ) and to make the contribution of each object in the sample apparent .",
    "the errors were estimated from poisson statistics in the sample , combined with the uncertainties in volume determination resulting from the photometric errors .    restricting the he s luminosity function to @xmath65 ( 14 objects ) results in slightly larger error bars , but the space densities change only insignificantly , by less than 0.05dex , and , overplotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqlf ] , could not even be distinguished from the @xmath1 relation .",
    "we thus feel justified to neglect differential evolution within our redshift shell ; we shall further investigate and qualify this assumption below .",
    "up to now , the bqs provides the only comparison sample in the region @xmath66 and @xmath1 , containing 45 objects that fulfill also the condition @xmath31 . surprisingly , there is yet  to our knowledge  no _ direct _ determination of the local qlf based on bqs objects alone .",
    "we have therefore computed a qlf from this sample with the same methods used for our own data , taking magnitudes , survey limits , and areas from sg83 .",
    "we show the results of these computations as a cumulative distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqlf ] .",
    "( since all other literature data are available only in binned form , we have also binned the bqs lf in @xmath19 , to achieve a more uniform presentation . )",
    "as mentioned above , galactic extinction is neglected for these data ; at any rate , the effect should be very small .",
    "the space densities found from the he s data are much higher than those derived from the bqs , with the discrepancy increasing with luminosity .",

    "we have used the additional seyfert  1 sample with @xmath30 .",

    "the maximum redshift @xmath67 at which object @xmath68 would still have been included in the survey had to be determined for each object . because of the superposition of a host galaxy with constant intrinsic scale length and a point - like nucleus , the small - aperture magnitudes depended on redshift in a complicated way , and @xmath67 was therefore not only a function of @xmath17 and @xmath13 but also of intrinsic properties .",
    "we used the available ccd images to simulate the mixing of agn / host contributions into the aperture as a function of redshift @xmath5 , resulting in an array of @xmath69 values , one for each field @xmath70 . for simplicity , table  [ tab : seyferts ] supplies ` effective ' values @xmath33 that permit a direct conversion into space densities .",
    "a @xmath71 test ( schmidt @xcite ) , implemented in the generalisation proposed by avni & bahcall ( @xcite ) , gives a mean value of @xmath72 ( individual values are also listed in table  [ tab : seyferts ] ) .",
    "compared with the expectation value of 0.5 for a complete , non - evolving , homogeneously distributed sample , there is no evidence for major incompleteness .",
    "the resulting luminosity function is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sy1lf ] .",
    "it can be seen that a host galaxy correction is important particularly for the intrinsically faintest objects in the sample : without correction , the luminosity function shows a steep upturn at @xmath73 ; for these objects , even the small - aperture magnitude is dominated by the host rather than by the agn .",
    "although the sample is not large , the derived space densities are fully consistent with previous estimates ( cheng et al .  @xcite ; huchra & burg @xcite ) .",
    "however , none of these previous investigations have payed as much attention to an appropriate host galaxy correction , neither for source luminosities nor for the survey volume , as we have .",

    "the he s has the potential to provide new samples covering the brightest parts of the known qso population , and it will be a promising task for the future to combine our results with those of fainter surveys .",
    "such an analysis is , however , not the scope of the present paper .",
    "we only remark that even at redshifts higher than @xmath115 , the qlf pieces sampled by the he s do not show significant deviations from an extrapolation of the local relation .",
    "a more quantitative discussion of this issue is deferred to a later paper .",
    "our results imply that the palomar bright quasar survey is not only incomplete , but also heavily biased .",
    "the general incompleteness may be estimated from the surface densities to be around a factor of 23 .",
    "this effect has been noted by others before ( wampler & ponz @xcite ; goldschmidt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and we have at present no easy explanation for it . some mild adjustment of the bqs data to higher values of space densities and luminosities may be required because of neglected galactic extinction , but this can not account for the observed discrepany .",
    "one possibility is that the rather large photometric errors in the bqs , reflected in the @xmath116 colours , scattered many qsos out of the uv excess domain .",
    "there seems to be an additional deficit of luminous low - redshift qsos , by another factor of @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "this discrepancy is apparent already from simply counting the number of @xmath1 qsos more luminous than @xmath119 : there are 5 objects in the present he s sample , while the entire bqs contains only 15 such sources , in a more than 15 times larger area . as",
    "this is the first detection of such an effect , one has to carefully consider systematic errors .",
    "note , however , that the he s is the first optical qso survey since completion of the bqs that is sensitive to a similar range of redshifts and luminosities , and it is therefore not altogether inconceivable that substantial selection biases have remained unnoticed over a long time .",
    "the good agreement between the he s @xmath47 or @xmath120 surface densities with other major surveys , e.g. , the lbqs ( hewett et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the edinburgh survey ( goldschmidt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or the hbqs ( cristiani et al .",
    "@xcite ) , makes it implausible that the he s photometric zeropoint could be seriously in error .",
    "we also tested our method of zero - point corrected ccd photometry .",
    "all relevant quantities were recomputed based on the standard approach of using only photographic magnitudes measured over large apertures , without any systematic change of results , except that the luminosities of low - redshift qsos with bright host galaxies were often _ over_estimated in the photographic data , creating a bias towards even higher qlf values .",
    "the ccd approach thus seems justified and appropriate .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath121 luminosity function for the bqs was based on the same procedures as applied to our own data .",
    "we neglected differential evolution within the @xmath1 shell , but the _ observed _ discrepancy is independent of any assumed evolution law , and therefore most likely caused by real incompleteness in the bqs sample .",
    "the exclusion of objects of non - stellar appearance in the bqs is an intuitively appealing candidate mechanism for this additional incompleteness .",
    "it is obvious at first glance ( and has in fact never been disputed ) that the bqs sample is systematically lacking low - luminosity seyferts ; it has usually been assumed that this selection effect ceased to be valid for @xmath122 .",
    "our results suggest that this is not the case . however , it is then somewhat surprising that the incompleteness should be smallest , almost disappearing , in the luminosity range around @xmath123 , as seems to follow from fig .",
    "[ fig : lqlf ] .",
    "in fact , this would then be the _ only _ region of the entire hubble diagram where the bqs counts were not significantly below those of the he s .    increased incompleteness for the most luminous qsos seems a possible , but rather unlikely explanation . if , instead , the bqs magnitudes particularly for the slightly resolved @xmath124 objects were _ systematically too bright _ , overcompleteness would occur , scattering objects into the sample from below the flux limit . we know from our own experience with photometry of resolved objects on digitised photographic plates that such effects exist , especially if a large digitisation aperture is used ( this is why we decided to incorporate the ccd measurements ) .",
    "the bqs was based on pds scans with an aperture of @xmath125 ( green & morrill @xcite ) , and magnitudes were basically isophotal in photographic density .",
    "we _ suspect _ that these technical details provide a clue to the above contradiction , and that incompleteness due to the rejection of extended qso hosts could be partly counteracted by photometric bias and overcompleteness for only marginally resolved objects .",
    "further analysis of this point is certainly required .",
    "if our hypothesis is correct , two important conjectures can be made : ( 1 ) the slope of the qlf for @xmath126 is much flatter than previous investigators estimated , weakening the evidence for a ` break ' in the seyfert / qso transition regime ( e.g. , marshall @xcite )  the local qlf presented here showing essentially _ no _ break at all .",
    "note that also in the seyfert lf of cheng et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the presence of such a break is not really demanded by the data .",
    "( 2 ) the bqs sample , up to now the prime source for luminous radio - quiet low - redshift qsos , might suffer from severe selection biases with respect to the morphological properties of their galaxy hosts .",
    "the local luminosity function derived in this paper is independent of samples collected at higher redshifts , and therefore well suited to test and constrain possible evolution laws .",
    "existing estimates of the qlf at redshift @xmath127 ( e.g. , boyle et al .",
    "@xcite ) show a marked break , or change of slope , at intermediate luminosities , that shifts towards lower values with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "we have argued above that the local equivalent of this break is probably an artefact .",
    "the flat slope of the @xmath6 qlf derived in this paper , and the absence of clear features , demand , on the assumption that the high @xmath5 qlf determinations are correct , that both shape and slope of the qlf change strongly with redshift .",
    "this clearly is in contradiction to the ` standard picture ' of pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) , where a double power - law luminosity function with invariant logarithmic shape is merely shifted along the luminosity axis .",
    "however , it should be noted that virtually _ all _ evolution modelling since 1983 had to rely on the bqs data of sg83 , to cover an otherwise inaccessible part of the hubble diagram .",
    "hence , in these regions , the models merely reproduce the incompleteness and possible biases of the bqs contribution .",
    "the problem that qso surveys were notoriously incomplete at low redshifts was of course realised by most researchers , and it has become customary to apply a lower redshift cutoff of @xmath128 to all samples .",
    "the construction of a @xmath129 qlf from such models has therefore always the character of an _ extrapolation _ outside the validated range , and should be treated with appropriate caution .",
    "even so , a _ quantitative _ comparison between evolutionary models and actual measurements of the local seyfert  1/qlf is a powerful test which deserves higher attention than it has been paid to in the past , compared to the careful analyses of higher redshift data .    in the construction of the @xmath1 local qlf",
    "we have not corrected individual luminosities for statistical evolution .",
    "while it is true that such a neglect could artificially flatten the luminosity function , evolution must be fairly strong for the effect to be relevant .",
    "we show now that the no - evolution assumption was , in fact , the best approximation one could possibly make , over the range of luminosities covered by the he s . in the case of evolution ,",
    "the lfs of adjacent , non - overlapping redshift shells should be different . for the simple case of ple with the rate suggested ,",
    "e.g. , by boyle et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , one would expect an abscissa offset of @xmath130mag between @xmath65 and @xmath112 . the necessity to invoke such an offset",
    "is not apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : evolqlf ] . while it might be consistent with our data to allow for a somewhat steeper intrinsic slope of the qlf , combined with mild evolution , there is certainly no _ evidence _ for evolution in the data .",
    "these conclusions are supported by results reported recently from other surveys .",
    "hewett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , with a preliminary analysis of the lbqs , showed that the qlf flattens considerably at @xmath131 ; a similar conclusion was reached by miller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the edinburgh survey .",
    "although both surveys have the usual lower redshift limit excluding the local population ( @xmath120 for the edinburgh survey , @xmath47 for the lbqs ) , a prediction for the slope of the local qlf can be made by extrapolating the trend seen by miller et al . ;",
    "the result is consistent with our measured value of @xmath4 .",
    "a flatter qlf implies a higher fraction of luminous quasars among the total population .",
    "our results indicate therefore , in agreement with hewett et al .  and miller et al .",
    ", that the evolution of the most luminous quasars must proceed considerably slower than suggested by the notion of pure luminosity evolution .",
    "we have analysed a new , flux - limited and well - defined sample of qsos & seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "host - galaxy dependent selection and photometric biases , if not absent , are greatly reduced in comparison to other optically selected samples .",
    "we find that the derived space density of luminous qsos in the local universe is much higher than previous surveys indicated , and that consequently these objects show a much slower cosmological evolution .    with the present sample of 55 qsos and seyferts in 33 fields , only a small fraction of the he s area is covered .",
    "we have already acquired , and partly processed , much additional plate material enlarging the survey by a significant factor . for example , we now have several fields in common with the bqs , and it shall soon be possible to pursue the question of incompleteness and biases in the bqs by a direct comparison of objects and photometry .    to understand and model",
    "the process of quasar evolution requires strong constraints from observations .",
    "it seems now that we are farther away from a coherent empirical picture of the qso population and its evolution than thought a few years ago .",
    "quasars of different luminosities evolve differently , and quasars do not necessarily evolve with the same rate at different cosmological epochs .",
    "there are presumably more parameters needed to describe quasar evolution properly than in the simple model of ` pure luminosity evolution ' .",
    "the ultimate aim of qso survey work is the deduction of intrinsic physical properties from statistical samples .",
    "unfortunately the physical processes in active galaxy nuclei are poorly understood , and the relations between statistical and physical properties therefore far from unique .",
    "the best study cases for nuclear activity in galaxies are nearby seyferts ; as shown above , the luminosity function of seyfert  1 nuclei can be smoothly continued into the classical quasar regime , without a significant change of slope or break .",
    "while this by no means proves that seyfert  1 nuclei are simply scaled - down versions of quasars , it suggest a continuity of properties rather than distinct classes . with the completion of the he s",
    ", a large and well - defined sample of highly luminous low - redshift qsos will become available , to study the relationship between qsos , their environments , and their evolution in detail .",
