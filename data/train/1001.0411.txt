    "at microscopic scales our world is known to obey quantum mechanics which is characterized by an indeterminism giving rise to fluctuations in measurements .",
    "if spacetime , like all matter and energy , undergoes quantum fluctuations , there will be an intrinsic limitation to the accuracy with which one can measure a distance @xmath0 , for that distance fluctuates by @xmath1 .",
    "on fairly general grounds , we expect @xmath2 , @xcite where @xmath3 is the planck length , the characteristic length scale in quantum gravity .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 specifies the different quantum foam models .",
    "( the canonical model @xcite corresponds to @xmath5 with @xmath6 . )    applying quantum mechanics and black hole physics ( from general relativity ) , we @xcite find that a distance @xmath0 fluctuates by an amount @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding quantum foam model with @xmath8 has become known as the holographic model since it can be shown @xcite to be consistent with the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "there are deep similarities between the problem of quantum gravity and turbulence @xcite .",
    "the connection between these seemingly disparate fields is provided by the role of diffeomorphism symmetry in classical gravity and the volume preserving diffeomorphisms of classical fluid dynamics .",
    "furthermore , in the case of irrotational fluids in three spatial dimensions , the equation for the fluctuations of the velocity potential can be written in a geometric form  @xcite of a harmonic laplace ",
    "beltrami equation : @xmath9 . here , apart from a conformal factor , the effective space time metric has the canonical adm form @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the sound velocity and @xmath12 are the components of the fluid s velocity vector .",
    "we observe that in this expression for the metric , the velocity of the fluid @xmath12 plays the role of the shift vector @xmath13 which is the lagrange multiplier for the spatial diffeomorphism constraint ( the momentum constraint ) in the canonical dirac / adm treatment of einstein gravity : @xmath14 .",
    "hence in the fluid dynamics context , @xmath15 , and a fluctuation of @xmath12 would imply a fluctuation of the shift vector .",
    "this is possible provided the metric of spacetime fluctuates , which is a very loose , intuitive , semi - classical definition of the quantum foam .",
    "but which quantum foam model ?",
    "recall @xmath16 .",
    "if one defines the velocity as @xmath17 , where the natural characteristic time scale is @xmath18 , then it follows that @xmath19 .",
    "it is now obvious that a kolmogorov - like scaling @xcite in turbulence has been obtained , i.e. , the velocity scales as @xmath20 and the two - point function has the needed two - thirds power law provided that @xmath8 .",
    "since the velocities play the role of the shifts , they describe how the metric fluctuates at the planck scale .",
    "the implication is that at short distances , spacetime is a chaotic and stochastic fluid in a turbulent regime @xcite with the kolmogorov length @xmath0 .",
    "the energy cascades are a property of the spacetime foam .",
    "but we emphasize that this interpretation of the kolmogorov scaling in the quantum gravitational setting is valid only for the case of holographic quantum foam ( corresponding to @xmath8 ) .",
    "dimensions and the kraichnan and kolmogorov scalings in @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "we argue that this string theory of turbulence should be understood from the viewpoint of the @xmath22 dictionary .",
    "we find that not only can string theory be useful in formulating a theory of turbulence , but the physics of turbulence may provide some guidance to understanding the quantum foam phase of strong quantum gravity . ]",
    "we @xcite suggested that spacetime foam might be uncovered by looking for unresolved cores in the images of distant quasars .",
    "@xcite the point is that , due to quantum foam - induced fluctuations in the phase velocity of an incoming light wave from a distant point source , the wave front itself develops a small scale `` foamy '' structure .",
    "this results in the wave vector acquiring a cumulative random fluctuation in direction with an angular spread of the order of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fluctuation in the phase of the electromagnetic wave with wavelength @xmath25 after traveling a distance @xmath0 from the distant source . in effect , spacetime foam creates a `` seeing disk '' whose angular diameter is @xcite @xmath26 .    for a telescope or interferometer with baseline length @xmath27 , this means that dispersion ( on the order of @xmath28 in the normal to the wave front ) will be recorded as a spread in the angular size of a distant point source , causing a reduction in the strehl ratio , and/or the fringe visibility when @xmath29 for a diffraction limited telescope .",
    "radians . on the other hand ,",
    "an infrared interferometer with @xmath30 meters ( like the vlti ) has @xmath31 . ] thus , in principle , for arbitrarily large distances spacetime foam sets a lower limit on the observable angular size of a source at a given wavelength @xmath25 . furthermore",
    ", the disappearance of `` point sources '' will be strongly wavelength dependent happening first at short wavelengths .",
    "interferometer systems ( like the vlti when it reaches its design performance ) with multiple baselines may have sufficient signal to noise to allow for the detection of quantum foam fluctuations .    more recently we @xcite have considered the feasibility of using various existing or proposed telescopes ( for wavelengths from hard x - rays down to radio waves ) to test the different spacetime foam models .",
    "figure 1 shows the prediction made for three different models of spacetime foam corresponding to @xmath32 respectively , for the size of observed haloes produced by accumulated phase dispersion for a source at two redshifts , respectively @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the labeled arrows delineate the diffraction limited response of various telescopes .",
    "if the arrow representing a telescope s diffraction limited response lies below the halo size curve for a given @xmath35 , that model may be excluded by observations .",
    "model , but exclude all models with @xmath36 . ]",
    "we notice that the vlti appears to be the most promising to test the holographic model .",
    "if there is unity of physics connecting the very small and the very large , then it is natural to apply holographic quantum foam physics to cosmology .",
    "@xcite we find that , according to the cosmololgy inspired by holographic quantum foam ( dubbed hfc ) , the cosmic density is @xmath37 , consistent with observation ( @xmath38 is the hubble parameter of the observable universe and @xmath39 is the hubble radius ) , and that the cosmic entropy is given by @xmath40 . furthermore , with the aid of archived data from the hubble space telescope indicating the demise of the @xmath41 model ,",
    "hfc has provided another argument for the existence of dark energy ( indepenent of other cosmological / astrophysical observations of recent years ) .",
    "successes of the conventional big bang cosmology , such as nucleosynthesis , can also be incorporated into hfc .",
    "here we concentrate on one crucial question : what is the overriding difference between conventional matter and dark energy ( perhaps also dark matter ) according to hfc ?",
    "since dark energy carries most of the energy of the universe , let us focus on its constituent particles .",
    "consider a perfect gas of @xmath42 particles obeying boltzmann statistics at temperature @xmath43 in a volume @xmath44 .",
    "for the problem at hand , we take @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( the average energy carried by each particle ) . a standard calculation yields the partition function @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "we get , for the entropy of the system , @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the important point to note is that , since @xmath51 , the entropy @xmath52 becomes nonsensically negative .",
    "but the solution is pretty obvious : the @xmath42 inside the log in @xmath52 somehow must be absent . in that case",
    ", the gibbs @xmath53 factor must be absent from the partition function @xmath54 , accordingly the  particles \" are distinguishable and nonidentical , and the entropy becomes @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "now the only known consistent statistics in greater than two space dimensions without the gibbs factor is infinite statistics ( sometimes called  quantum boltzmann statistics \" ) .",
    "thus the  particles \" constituting dark energy obey infinite statistics , instead of the familiar fermi or bose statistics .",
    "( using the matrix theory approach , jejjala , kavic and minic @xcite have also argued that dark energy quanta obey infinite statistics . )",
    "this is the crucial difference between the constituents of dark energy and ordinary matter , according to hfc . since each  particle \" has such long wavelength ( @xmath56 ) , dark energy acts like a ( dynamical ) cosmological constant . but to get the correct equation of state and an appropriate transition from an earlier decelerating to a recent accelerating cosmic expansion , one may need to take into account the coupling between pressureless dark matter and holographic dark energy .",
    "@xcite finally we note that a theory of particles obeying infinite statistics can not be local .",
    "@xcite but intuitively holographic theories also possess non - locality .",
    "thus it is not surprising that non - locality is present in hfc , a cosmology that is intimately connected to holography .",
    "@xcite the appearance of infinite statistics in hfc is suggestive of a holographic view of spacetime .",
