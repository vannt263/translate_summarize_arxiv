    "coupled map lattices @xcite have provided fruitful and computationally efficient models for the investigation of a variety of dynamical processes in spatially distributed systems . in particular , the discrete - space character of coupled map systems makes them specially appropriate for the investigation of spatiotemporal dynamics on nonuniform networks that can represent models of heterogeneous media .",
    "the nonuniformity may be due to the intrinsic heterogeneous nature of the substratum , typical of pattern formation in biological contexts , or it may arise from random imperfections or fluctuations in the medium at some length scales .",
    "such heterogeneities can have significant effects on the formation of spatial patterns , for example , they can induce reberverators in excitable media and defects can serve as nucleation sites for domain growth processes .",
    "recently , the study of the phase - ordering properties of systems of coupled chaotic maps and their relationship with ising models in statistical physics has been a focus of attention @xcite .",
    "these works have mainly assumed the phase competition dynamics taking place on an ordered spatial support .",
    "this article investigates the phenomenon of phase growth in coupled chaotic maps on lattices with randomly distributed impurities as a model for studying this process on nonuniform media .",
    "in particular , this model of coupled maps on nonuniform networks yields a scenario to explore the role that the local configurations of the underlying lattice play on the statistical properties of phase ordering processes on spatiotemporal systems .",
