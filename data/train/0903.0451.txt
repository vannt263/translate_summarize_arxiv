    "the process of coherent pion production by neutrinos is one of the important reactions that occur in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it dominates at very low momentum transfers of the leptons and in the forward direction which may help to monitor the flux of the beam and will help to estimate backgrounds .",
    "for instance in the oscillation of @xmath1 into @xmath2 one searches in the far away detector the reaction @xmath3 and coherent production of @xmath4 s produces a background .",
    "for this reason there are new theoretical articles and experimental mesurements dealing with this process .",
    "the neutral and charged current reactions are @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a nucleus . for the process we use variables in the rest frame of the nucleus with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "coherent production implies that the nucleus does not break up or alter its quantum numbers during the process .    due to the isospin structure of the charged and neutral currents ,",
    "the charged cross section is at high energies , approximately , twice as big as the neutral one . at low energies difference",
    "arise from the non - vanishing mass of the outgoing lepton and the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa - matrix element ( ckm ) in the charged current case .",
    "hence it is sufficient to concentrate on the charged current reaction within the theory .",
    "its feynman diagram is shown in figure [ fig : ccfeydia ] .",
    "our calculation @xcite is based on two basic facts : + 1 . coherent production of pions is the process where the four - momentum - transfer squared between the current and the produced pion is small so the nucleus remains intact .",
    "the minimum value is given to a good approximation by @xmath11 and is achieved for @xmath12 .",
    "the important experimental region will turn out to be @xmath13 .",
    "we remind the reader that , neglecting the nucleus recoil energy , @xmath14 is calculated as @xcite @xmath15 ^ 2 + \\left [ \\sum_{\\mu , \\pi } \\left ( e_i - p_i^\\parallel \\right ) \\right]^2 .\\ ] ]    \\2 . in this region ,",
    "the dominant component of the leptonic current has helicity zero , i.e. @xmath16 defined in equation ( [ lambda0 ] ) , below .",
    "the domain @xmath12 and @xmath17 is the region where pcac is valid and it has been shown that the dominant amplitude is determined by chiral symmetry .",
    "in fact when we write the amplitude for the subprocess @xmath18 as the sum @xmath19 with @xmath20 the remainder , the symmetry determines @xmath21 which is exactly the term that the zero helicity polarization selects and makes it dominant . in this picture the weak current converts into a pion before entering the nucleus .",
    "we shall quantify these results in the following sections .",
    "+ this approach has many advantages :    1 .",
    "it avoids discussing what happens within the nucleus since it will use @xmath22 elastic scattering data . in this sense",
    "it incorporates the pion - nucleus diffrative peak into the neutrino scattering .",
    "it is applicable at low and high energies , provided that some required kinematic cuts are made .",
    "it includes the lepton mass exactly and quantifies the various approximations .",
    "the purpose of this article is to quantify the results with numerical calculations .",
    "there are other articles on this topic @xcite .",
    "one among them follows the same approach @xcite .",
    "a very different approach descibes coherent pion production at very low energies as the excitation of the @xmath23-resonance and includes modifications through nuclear medium effects demanding that the nucleus remains in its ground state for coherent scattering @xcite .",
    "the theoretical background of this paper is the same as in @xcite . for completeness",
    "we repeat its main features .",
    "the invariant matrix element of the charged current reaction is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fermi coupling constant and @xmath26 the ckm matrix element .",
    "the leptonic current is expressed in a straight forward way @xmath27 whereas the hadronic matrix element will be treated below .",
    "the leptonic current is decomposed into the basis of the four polarisation vectors of the exchange boson .",
    "select the 3-momentum of @xmath28 along the @xmath29-axis and define the basis of polarization vectors @xmath30 @xmath31 note that they differ from the original paper @xcite by their normalization factors .",
    "this has been taken into account in the following formulas but does not change the results .",
    "the polarisation vectors satisfy the completeness relation @xmath32    in the cross sections the leptonic tensor appears @xmath33 with the indices running over the four polarisations .",
    "numerical studies in reference @xcite have shown that the transverse polarizations , i.e. right and left handed cross sections are smaller in coherent scattering and they will be omitted .    from equation ( [ leptensor ] ) we obtain the relevant matrix elements : @xmath34 ^ 2}{q^2 ( q^2 + \\nu^2 ) } - 4 ( q^2 + m_\\mu^2)\\label{l00}\\\\ l_{l0 } & = & 4 m_\\mu^2 \\frac{q^2 ( 2e_\\nu - \\nu ) - \\nu m_\\mu^2 } { q^2 \\sqrt{q^2+\\nu^2 } } \\\\ l_{ll } & = & 4 m_\\mu^2 \\left ( 1 + \\frac{m_\\mu^2}{q^2 } \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the mass of the lepton in the final state is explicit and will be kept throughout the calculation .",
    "we also use later @xmath35 as in reference @xcite and the relation between them is @xmath36 .",
    "it is now possible to write the spin averaged matrix element as    @xmath37    as mentioned in the introduction the divergence of the matrix element is determined by pcac .",
    "the matrix element of the axial current can be written as a sum of the pion pole and the remaining contribution @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the elastic scattering on a nucleus and @xmath20 is a smooth function which includes all other contributions .",
    "the pcac relation gives @xmath40 combining the two equations one obtains @xmath41    with these relations one is also able to calculate all matrix elements in equation ( [ msq ] ) because @xmath42 is given by equation ( [ qa ] ) and is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "the matrix element for helicity zero is calculated in the following way . from the property @xmath44",
    "it follows that the inner product of the pion pole with the helicity zero polarization vanishes . the remaining term is now estimated @xmath45 thus the matrix elements for both polarizations are estimated .",
    "we write next the triple differential cross section as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the elastic pion nucleus cross section and where all muon mass terms have been kept in the calculation .",
    "as mentioned already the right- and left - handed cross sections are small and have been neglected . since they appear as positive additive terms , our estimate is a lower bound for the coherent cross section .",
    "the corresponding neutral current cross section is @xmath48 in this formula the muon mass in @xmath49 has to be set zero .",
    "the most detailed and convincing evidence for coherent scattering is the explicit observation of the triple differential cross sections in equations ( [ cc ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) . the characteristic signature is the sharp peak in the @xmath14-distributions which was the main feature in the original discovery and interpretation @xcite .",
    "subsequent and recent experiments integrate over the @xmath14- and other variables so that special attention must be given to the ranges of integration in order to ascertain that the model is still valid in these regions . in this article",
    "we shall integrate over data for @xmath50 elastic scattering .",
    "we identify the incoming pion energy with the variable @xmath51 and integrate over experimental data for elastic pion - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the cross section as follows : @xmath52\\ ] ] and fitted the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 to the data .",
    "their numerical values are given in table [ tab : model ] .",
    ".parameters of the elastic pion nuclues cross section model . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the earlier article @xcite we used the variable @xmath55 , which defined kinematic regions available in the experiments .",
    "it is a fortunate property of coherent scattering that the cross section peaks at low values of @xmath56 and @xmath51 .",
    "in fact the contribution to the integrated cross section from the region @xmath57 is negligible .",
    "our estimates are satisfied for @xmath58 where most of the cross section is located .",
    "one can also integrate over restricted regions of the phase space in order to determine the fraction of the cross section in these regions .    .",
    "the lines represent different integration limits ( see text ) . ]    .",
    "the lines represent different integration limits ( see text ) . ]",
    "the structure of the cross section in figure [ fig : de1cc ] also indicates the important regions of integration . to assure the validity of the approximation in equation ( [ remainingterm ] )",
    "we integrate over the range @xmath59 the values for @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given in the appendix of reference @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 integration is treated more carefully .",
    "the lower limit of integration is given in equation ( a8 ) of reference @xcite .",
    "in the neutral current case it is zero .",
    "we calculated the differential cross section @xmath62 for @xmath63 and four values for the lower limit of the energy @xmath51 .",
    "the results are shown for neutral currents in figure [ fig : e1nallxi ] and for charged currents in figure [ fig : e1callxi ] .",
    "the four curves correspond to various cuts in the minimum value of the energy @xmath51 , defined in table [ tab : phasespace ] .",
    "we note that the cross section between @xmath64 is negligibly small since the dashed curves for @xmath65 coincides with curve for @xmath66 .",
    "( top to bottom ) and @xmath67 ( dashed ) at @xmath68 . ]",
    "( top to bottom ) and @xmath67 ( dashed ) at @xmath68 . ]",
    "we repeated this calculation for various incident neutrino energies and the results are shown in figures [ fig : e1051nxi0 ] and [ fig : e1051cxi0 ] for neutral and charged currents , respectively .",
    "the interesting feature is that the cross section extends now to higher values of @xmath56 .",
    "although the differential cross section is concentrated at low momentum transfers , for higher neutrino energies there is a tail that extends to larger values of @xmath56 and must be taken into account in the integrated cross sections .     at @xmath69 . ]     at @xmath69 . ]",
    "the neutral current cross section reaches a specific value at @xmath70 , the adler point .",
    "it is estimated from our formulas ( [ l00 ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) to give @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the weighted elastic pion - nucleus cross section . for @xmath68",
    "the adler point is about @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "this is a realistic average of the weighted hadronic cross section ( see figure [ fig : hadron ] ) . a similar comparison for the charged current is more indirect because of the phase space effects introduced by the mass of the muon . for the charged current",
    "an integration over a small region of @xmath56 is more appropriate for comparison with experiments .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for higher energies the turnover of the differential cross section in the charged current case is less prominent and disappears , a property caused by the fact that the muon mass is negligible compared to the neutrino energy .    at higher neutrino energies bigger momentum transfers gain more importance .",
    "figures [ fig : e1051nxi0 ] and [ fig : e1051cxi0 ] show the differential cross section of the neutral and charged current process , respectively , for @xmath67 . for higher energies",
    "the cross section is not limited within a small @xmath56 region .",
    "thus the @xmath56 integration interval has to be extended to higher values .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : e1051cxi0 ] indicate that the formulas we derived have a tail that extends to higher values of @xmath56 .",
    "however , at large values of @xmath56 the nucleus breaks up and the scattering is not coherent . at the same time",
    "the pcac approximation does not hold .",
    "fortunately , the change in the curves of figures 9 and 20 between @xmath75 and 4 is relatively small .",
    "experimental groups separate the coherent events from other events by the absence of stubs in bubble chambers , a signature indicating that the nucleus does not break up .",
    "the bebc group @xcite found that the @xmath56-values are lower for coherent events and do not extend beyond @xmath76 .",
    "these results suggest that a @xmath77 must be introduced in the integration of the cross section or a phenomenological factor @xmath78 in order to provide a cut - off in the @xmath56 dependence ( see @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we calculate integrated coherent cross sections for various upper values of @xmath79 , 0.5 , 1.0 and @xmath80 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : totalnccuts ] for neutral current and figure [ fig : totalcccuts ] for charged current reactions , where the effect of @xmath77 is important .     for @xmath67 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "see @xcite for experimental data . ]     for @xmath67 ( bottom to top ) .",
    "see @xcite for experimental data . ]    for comparison we also included experimental results from several groups @xcite .",
    "the experiments use different targets which we must rescale to the carbon target .",
    "since the pion - nucleus cross section is a main input in this work we must rescale the results according to    @xmath81    which has been established in pion - nucleus elastic scattering @xcite . with this rescaling",
    "the agreement at higher energies prefers a @xmath77 between 1.0 and @xmath80 .",
    "for the energy of the neutrinos we use an average value from the neutrino flux .",
    "there are two ways to account for the @xmath56-dependence :    1 .",
    "whenever possible , introduce an experimental cut - off to the coherent events where our model is valid .",
    "integrate the cross sections on equations ( [ cc ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) with a phenomenological factor @xmath78 , introduced by other authors @xcite , which represents the effects of heavier vector mesons and treat @xmath82 as a parameter .",
    "neutrino induced coherent pion production is described adequately by the method described in reference @xcite .",
    "it is argued again that chiral symmetry relates coherent production of pions to the pion - nucleus elastic scattering in a general way , provided that @xmath83 .",
    "our formalism and results are close but not identical to a recent article @xcite , where the elastic pion - carbon data are now used as well , which reduces their earlier predictions .",
    "we both use elastic pion - nucleus scattering data and the small difference arise from the handling of the experimental data and the limits of integrations .    using pion - carbon scattering data we presented quantitative results for many cross sections .",
    "we emphasize that kinematic limits , as in equation ( [ trange ] ) for @xmath14 and the maximum value of @xmath56 in figures [ fig : e1051nxi0]-[fig : totalcccuts ] , are important .",
    "an overview of the double - differential cross section is shown in figure [ fig : de1cc ] and [ fig : de10cc ] showing the main characteristics of the process .",
