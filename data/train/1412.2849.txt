    "in algebraic geometry and number theory , one is frequently interested in abelian varieties with extra endomorphisms , and their moduli spaces .",
    "the study of elliptic curves and their moduli spaces has been extremely influential in the last century ( for instance , see @xcite ) .",
    "higher dimensional abelian varieties have also seen many applications ; however , it has remained quite a challenge to provide explicit computational descriptions for these or their moduli spaces .",
    "there has been quite a lot of work in the direction of explicit approaches to abelian surfaces in the last couple of decades .",
    "this paper is chiefly concerned with moduli spaces of genus @xmath0 curves with decomposable jacobians .",
    "we say that an abelian variety @xmath6 over a field @xmath7 is decomposable or reducible over @xmath7 if it is isogenous over @xmath7 to a product of abelian varieties of smaller dimension .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in principally polarized abelian surfaces @xmath6 which are isogenous to a product of elliptic curves . a natural way to produce",
    "such an abelian surface is as the jacobian of a curve @xmath2 of genus @xmath0 , which has a map of degree @xmath8 to an elliptic curve @xmath3 .",
    "the morphism @xmath9 induces @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the curve @xmath2 also has a map of degree @xmath4 to the complement @xmath13 ( obtained by composing the embedding @xmath14 with the projection map ) and @xmath6 is isogenous to the product @xmath15 with kernel isomorphic to @xmath16 .",
    "we say that @xmath17 is @xmath18-split .",
    "the ( coarse ) moduli space we wish to parametrize is the space @xmath19 of pairs @xmath1 related by an _ optimal _ map of degree @xmath8 .",
    "( here , optimal means that the map does not factor through an unramified cover of @xmath3 . )",
    "it is a double cover of the moduli space @xmath20 of genus @xmath0 curves @xmath2 whose function field has an elliptic subfield of degree @xmath4 ; this latter locus is a hypersurface in @xmath21 , the moduli space of genus @xmath0 curves .",
    "classically , hyperelliptic curves with split jacobians were studied in the guise of the reduction of abelian integrals to elliptic integrals by algebraic transformations , going as far back as legendre and jacobi , who essentially gave a complete description of the moduli space for @xmath22 .",
    "the generic family of curves @xmath2 for @xmath23 was worked out by hermite , goursat , burkhardt , brioschi and bolza , and @xmath24 by bolza .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a summary of this classical literature .",
    "kuhn @xcite revisited this topic , giving a combinatorial description in terms of the branch points of the map @xmath25 as well as the hyperelliptic involution @xmath26 on @xmath2 , and adapting some examples to positive characteristic .",
    "this approach has led to fairly explicit descriptions of @xmath19 for @xmath27 by shaska and others @xcite . from an arithmetic standpoint ,",
    "reducible jacobians for @xmath28 have been studied in @xcite .",
    "frey and kani @xcite have also studied such covers for general @xmath4 by looking at pairs of elliptic curves @xmath3 and @xmath29 such that there is an galois equivariant anti - isometry between their @xmath4-torsion subschemes .",
    "their description connects @xmath19 to several interesting arithmetic questions and applications .    in this paper",
    ", we will take a rather different strategy to compute the moduli spaces @xmath19 , which does not focus on the map @xmath9 and its ramification locus .",
    "the key fact upon which our method rests is that a genus @xmath0 curve @xmath2 has a map of degree @xmath4 to an elliptic curve @xmath3 if and only if the point in @xmath30 corresponding to its jacobian @xmath17 lies on the humbert surface @xmath31 ( see @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "in other words , under the birational morphism @xmath32 , the image of @xmath20 is ( birationally ) identified with the humbert surface for discriminant @xmath33 .",
    "recall that for a discriminant @xmath34 , the humbert surface @xmath35 describes principally polarized abelian surfaces which have real multiplication by the quadratic ring of discriminant @xmath34 .",
    "its double cover is the hilbert modular surface @xmath36 which parametrizes pairs @xmath37 , where @xmath6 is a principally polarized abelian surface , and @xmath38 is a ring homomorphism . note that the reason @xmath39 is a double cover is because ( generically ) there are two choices for the action of @xmath40 .    in @xcite",
    ", a method was laid out to compute explicit models for these hilbert modular surfaces @xmath36 , relying on the computation of moduli spaces of suitable elliptic k3 surfaces , which are related to the abelian surfaces via a shioda ",
    "inose structure . in that paper , equations were given for rational models for the surfaces @xmath36 , for the thirty fundamental discriminants @xmath34 such that @xmath41 .",
    "these hilbert modular surfaces are coarse moduli spaces for principally polarized abelian surfaces with real multiplication by the ring of integers @xmath42 of @xmath43 .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend this method to compute the humbert surfaces for _ square _ discriminants @xmath44 , and our desired moduli space @xmath19 ( which is birational to @xmath45 ) , for @xmath5 . to do",
    "so requires several ideas beyond those of @xcite .",
    "first , we generalize the set - up and theorems in @xcite to the case of non - fundamental discriminants .",
    "this allows us to compute @xmath45 as a moduli space of k3 surfaces , but does not elucidate its structure as a moduli space of @xmath1 . in order to do so , we first describe explicitly a normalized tautological family of genus @xmath0 curves over the moduli space , using the method of certifying eigenforms for real multiplication from @xcite .",
    "finally , we describe a new method involving integration of eigenforms to recover the elliptic curves @xmath46 and @xmath47 associated to a given @xmath2 .",
    "our models agree with those in the literature for @xmath48 , and we go well beyond the previous state of the art with the higher values of @xmath4 . in doing so , we exhibit non - rational surfaces @xmath19 : the surfaces @xmath49 and @xmath50 are elliptic k3 , the next three @xmath51 and @xmath52 are honestly elliptic , whereas @xmath53 is a surface of general type .",
    "the geometric classification of these surfaces was studied in @xcite , but explicit algebraic models were not known before this work .",
    "we anticipate that our algebraic models for these moduli spaces will make it easy to carry out explicit arithmetic and geometric investigations .",
    "for instance , one can immediately apply our formulas to produce examples or even families of elliptic curves with anti - isometric @xmath4-torsion galois representations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ setup ] , we prove the necessary generalizations of the results from @xcite .",
    "each of the following sections treats a separate square discriminant .",
    "we outline the parametrization of the moduli space of elliptic k3 surfaces , and a sequence of `` elliptic hops '' converting to an elliptic fibration with @xmath54 and @xmath55 fibers .",
    "this allows us to compute the map to @xmath30 .",
    "we can then write down the explicit double cover giving a model of @xmath56 .",
    "we carry out some basic geometric analysis of the moduli space , and note any obvious arithmetic curves on it .",
    "we also provide a tautological family of genus @xmath0 curves over @xmath19 , as well as the @xmath57-invariants of both the associated elliptic curves is really the tautological family over the moduli space @xmath19 . ] @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "the source file for the paper .",
    "this will produce not only the latex file for this paper , but also the computer code .    for the computations involved in our work , we made frequent use of the computer algebra systems `",

    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant dms-0952486 , and by a grant from the mit solomon buchsbaum research fund .",
    "in this section , we generalize the main theorems of @xcite to the case of non - fundamental discriminant @xmath34 , which is a positive integer congruent to @xmath58 or @xmath59 modulo @xmath60 . in particular , this paper will deal with the case of square discriminant : @xmath44 , in which case the ring in question is an order in a split quadratic algebra ( i.e.  @xmath61 ) , rather than a real quadratic field .",
    "we first briefly go over the basic setup for this particular case , since the typical case considered in the literature is that of non - square discriminant . for more background on hilbert modular surfaces see @xcite , and for a quick introduction to the calculations of this section , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the notes @xcite also contain an excellent description of the theory of abelian varieties with extra endomorphisms , and the connection with k3 surfaces which was exploited in @xcite and is also used here .",
    "let @xmath44 , and @xmath42 the quadratic ring of discriminant @xmath34 .",
    "concretely , we can write @xmath62 with componentwise addition and multiplication",
    ". it has a @xmath63-basis @xmath64 given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the two embeddings @xmath67 of @xmath68 into @xmath69 are given by taking the first or second components and composing with @xmath70 .",
    "there are four square roots of @xmath34 in @xmath42 , namely @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "if we label @xmath73 , we see that @xmath59 and @xmath74 also form a @xmath63-basis , just as in the case of non - square discriminant .",
    "the involution which changes @xmath40 to @xmath75 is that which switches the two factors ; i.e.  takes @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "the trace map takes @xmath76 to @xmath78 , and the matrix of the trace form with respect to @xmath79 and @xmath80 is @xmath81 which has discriminant @xmath82 .",
    "the dual lattice @xmath83 with respect to the trace form has basis @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "( in fact , for a general discriminant , @xmath83 equals @xmath86 . ) the discriminant group @xmath87 is easily calculated to be @xmath88 if @xmath4 is odd , and @xmath89 if @xmath4 is even .",
    "we now adapt sections @xmath90 and @xmath60 of @xcite to the setting of non - fundamental discriminant .",
    "the outline of the method is as follows .    1 .",
    "the hilbert modular surface @xmath36 is the coarse moduli space of @xmath37 where @xmath6 is a principally polarized abelian surface , and @xmath91 is a homomorphism .",
    "the complex manifold @xmath92 can be obtained by compactifying @xmath93 .",
    "2 .   there is a map @xmath94 which simply takes the ppas @xmath6 .",
    "the image @xmath35 is the humbert surface of discriminant @xmath34 in @xmath30 , and the map from the hilbert modular surface has degree @xmath0 .",
    "the key first step is to realize @xmath35 as a moduli space of elliptic k3 surfaces , polarized by a particular lattice @xmath95 of rank @xmath96 and discriminant @xmath97 .",
    "we explicitly parametrize this moduli space @xmath98 , and compute the universal k3 family over it .",
    "we then find a different elliptic fibration on the ( family of ) k3 surfaces , with reducible fibers of type @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this is accomplished by a sequence of `` elliptic hops '' , which reflect @xmath0- and @xmath90-neighbor steps at the lattice level ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) or ( * ? ? ? * appendix a ) ) . by the main result of @xcite , from the final weierstrass equation we may read out the map @xmath101 , which is given in terms of igusa  clebsch invariants ( coordinates on @xmath30 @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we have an explicit birational model of @xmath35 . to get to @xmath36",
    ", we must identify the correct double cover .",
    "we first pin down the geometric branch locus as a union of certain modular curves ( by a result of hausmann ) , and interpret these curves in terms of the k3 moduli space ( the picard group jumps in a predictable manner ) .",
    "finally , we find the correct arithmetic twist by point - counting and matching characteristic polynomials of frobenius on the abelian and k3 sides .    the first part of ( * ?",
    "* section @xmath90 ) outlines the proof that @xmath93 is the coarse moduli space of principally polarized abelian surfaces with real multiplication by @xmath42 .",
    "the same proof goes through for arbitrary discriminant .",
    "of course , for @xmath44 , usually it is more convenient to understand a ppas with real multiplication by @xmath42 in terms of pairs of elliptic curves which have degree @xmath4 maps from a common genus @xmath0 curve , as described in the introduction .",
    "this is the approach taken in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a principally polarized abelian surface with @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath103 .",
    "the lattice @xmath104 has a basis with gram matrix @xmath105 of signature @xmath106 and discriminant @xmath97 .",
    "the proof of @xcite goes through with minor changes , noting that the rosati involution on @xmath107 must be the identity , since the other element of the galois group ( interchange of the factors in the square - discriminant case ) is not a positive involution .",
    "the proof of the next proposition is unchanged from the original .",
    "there is a primitive embedding , unique up to isomorphism , of the lattice @xmath42 into @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 be the orthogonal complement of @xmath42 in @xmath108 .",
    "then there is a primitive embedding , unique up to isomorphism , of @xmath109 into the k3 lattice @xmath110 .",
    "the main theorem of that section identifies the humbert surface with a moduli space of k3 surfaces lattice - polarized by @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 be the lattice @xmath113 .",
    "[ humbert ] let @xmath114 be the moduli space of k3 surfaces that are lattice polarized by @xmath95 .",
    "then the isomorphism @xmath115 of @xcite induces a birational surjective morphism @xmath116 .",
    "its proof relies on a key proposition involving the lattice embedding @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath109 in @xmath110 , uniquely described by the proposition above .",
    "the proof of the key proposition and the main theorem go through without any changes .",
    "we must next show that the branch locus of the map @xmath120 corresponds to a divisor @xmath121 in the moduli space of @xmath98 of k3 surfaces lattice polarized by @xmath95 , such that the rank of the k3 surface corresponding to a generic point on @xmath121 jumps to @xmath122 , and the discriminant of the picard group is @xmath123 or @xmath124 . in @xcite ,",
    "the argument used the fact that @xmath34 was fundamental ; we give a more general proof here , valid for arbitrary discriminant .",
    "first , we observe as in @xcite that the branch locus consists of a union of specific modular curves .",
    "let us consider the birational models @xmath125 for @xmath36 ( where @xmath126 ) and @xmath127 for @xmath30 , with @xmath128 being the siegel upper half space for genus @xmath0 .",
    "the two - to - one map @xmath129 factors through @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the interchange of coordinates on @xmath132 .",
    "the branch locus is the fixed point set of @xmath131 on @xmath125 .",
    "the one - dimensional part of the fixed point set of @xmath131 on @xmath133 is the union of the modular curves @xmath134 , where @xmath135 ranges over @xmath136 if @xmath34 is odd , and over @xmath137 if @xmath34 is even .",
    "next , we analyze what happens to the k3 surfaces along these modular curves .",
    "let @xmath138 be a natural number , and let @xmath2 be any component of the inverse image of a modular curve @xmath139 , under the birational surjective morphism @xmath140 .",
    "the k3 surface corresponding to a generic point of @xmath2 has nron  severi group of rank @xmath122 and discriminant @xmath141 .    by @xcite , the generic point on any component of a modular curve",
    "@xmath139 corresponds to an abelian surface @xmath6 whose ring of endomorphisms is a quaternionic order @xmath142 of discriminant @xmath143 . by @xcite , the nron ",
    "severi group of @xmath6 and the endomorphism ring are connected by the relation @xmath144 , the even part of the associated clifford ring . from this , it is easy to compute that @xmath104 must have rank @xmath90 and discriminant @xmath141 . by the shioda ",
    "inose structure , the picard group of the associated k3 surface must have rank @xmath122 and discriminant @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the part of the branch locus corresponding to the curve @xmath145 ( and @xmath146 if @xmath34 is even ) corresponds to a sublocus of k3 surfaces having picard group of discriminant @xmath124 ( respectively @xmath123 ) .",

    "let @xmath149 be an elliptic k3 surface with a reducible fiber of type @xmath99 and another of type @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , assume that @xmath149 has a section of height @xmath123 , for some natural number @xmath34 congruent to @xmath58 or @xmath59 modulo @xmath60",

    "first , assume that @xmath149 has no other reducible fibers .",
    "then , in particular , there can not be a torsion section : such a section would have height @xmath58 , which is impossible to obtain with only two reducible fibers of type @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath150 had discriminant @xmath0 , the mordell  weil lattice would be positive definite of rank @xmath0 and discriminant @xmath59 .",
    "the hermite constant in dimension @xmath0 is @xmath152 , so this would imply that there is a section of height at most @xmath153 , which is impossible with the fiber configuration ( the best we can do is @xmath154 ) . similarly , if @xmath150 had discriminant @xmath151 , we would need a section of height @xmath155 , which is still forbidden .",
    "note that we did not use the assumption of a section of height @xmath123 .",
    "for the case when @xmath149 could have additional reducible fibers , we have to do some additional analysis , but a similar proof applies .",
    "going back to our situation , let @xmath156 be the family of k3 surfaces lattice polarized by @xmath95 , over the base @xmath98 ( the coarse moduli space ) . in the third step of the method described above ,",
    "we find a different elliptic fibration on the k3 surface @xmath157 ( uniformly over @xmath158 on the base ) , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 fibers .",
    "however , according to the above proposition , for @xmath158 on one of the curves @xmath2 lying over @xmath147 or @xmath148 , we can not have such an elliptic fibration on @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , the weierstrass equation for the resulting @xmath160 fibration must be undefined ( or not minimal , or one of these fibers must degenerate further ) for @xmath158 on such a curve @xmath2 .",
    "this is reflected in the denominators of the expressions for the weierstrass coefficients and of the igusa ",
    "clebsch invariants , as well as the ( numerator of the ) invariant @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , by adding their irreducible factors to that of the list for discriminant @xmath124 ( and @xmath123 when @xmath34 is even ) , we can then continue with step 4 of @xcite .",
    "the remaining assertions and proofs of section @xmath60 of @xcite go through without any change .",
