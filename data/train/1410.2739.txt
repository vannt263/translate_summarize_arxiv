    "the coalescence of compact binary systems , either neutron star - neutron star ( bns ) or neutron star - black hole ( ns - bh ) are among the most promising sources for one of the first direct detections of gravitational waves ( gws ) with the new generation of interferometers : the two advanced - ligo ( aligo ) @xcite in hanford and livingston and advanced - virgo ( adv ) @xcite in cascina .",
    "these facilities will be able to detect the late stage of the coalescence , the merger and the ring down of the binary systems located within few hundreds mpc .",
    "the gravitational - wave signal during the adiabatic inspiral phase up to near the last stable orbit and the final damped ring down of the final black hole are accurately described by post - newtonian expansion and bh perturbation theory , while the progress of numerical relativity over the last decade has provided deep understanding of the merger @xcite , giving a good level of confidence for a detection by the network of aligo and adv ( in the following we name the combined network consisting of the three interferometers aligo and adv as alv ) . with the planed third generation gw detector , einstein telescope ( et )",
    "@xcite , envisioned to consist of three independent v - shaped michelson interferometers with 60@xmath2 opening angles , arm lengths of 10 km , arranged in a triangle configuration , and placed underground to reduce the influence of seismic noise , the maximal detection distance is expected to increase significantly over that of alv , reaching cosmological distances ( @xmath3 for bns ) .",
    "the coalescence of bns systems is also believed to be at the origin of the short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sgrbs ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the merger of the system produces a transient accretion disk , the gamma - ray emission being produced by the synchrotron and/or inverse compton scattering from shocks in an ultra relativistic jet .",
    "short grbs might also produce a so - called kilonova through r - processes @xcite .",
    "the standard hypothesis is that the bns coalescence results in a black hole , though it is possible that a magnetar , or a transient magnetar , is produced as the result of the merger @xcite .    in this context",
    "the coincident detection of both gws and electromagnetic radiation ( em ) would be of paramount importance :    * the coincident detection of a gw and em event would greatly improve the detection confidence with alv during the early operations of the facilities . * by using an em detection of a sgrb as a trigger , one can perform a targeted gw search .",
    "this would allow for the detection of fainter signals , resulting in a larger horizon distance .",
    "* on the other hand , gw alerts sent early to grb satellites and em telescopes could increase the chance of an em detection , if the error on sky localization is smaller than the area covered by the satellite @xcite .",
    "* coincident detections could help solve the enigma of grb progenitors ( for instance bns or ns - bh ) but also of the central engine ( the gw signature depends on the fate of the system , with the formation of either a black hole or magnetar ) and give increased insight in the physics and dynamics of the system * grb with measured redshift , observed also in gw , could be used as standard sirens to constrain the hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state @xcite or to recover the intrinsic mass distribution by breaking the observed mass - redshift degeneracy .    while long grbs ( lgrbs ) , assumed to originate from massive core collapse supernova",
    "have been detected out to a redshift @xmath4 @xcite , the maximal observed distance for sgrbs is considerably closer . from a comprehensive search for sgrbs in the rest - frame , @xcite found a maximum distance of @xmath5 .",
    "however , _",
    "swift _ is not optimal for the detection of sgrbs whose spectrum is on average harder than that of lgrbs .",
    "batse and fermi / gbm may have been able to detect sgrbs out to larger distance , but the larger sky localization errors associated with these experiments prevented any firm association with a given counterpart and thus redshift measurement .",
    "hopefully the situation is improving thanks to the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ) @xcite and other proposed wide - field experiments such as the french ormes project .",
    "the em emission of sgrbs ( as well as that of lgrbs ) is emitted in a narrow beam , though several estimates of the aperture of the jet have been reported @xcite .",
    "this drastically reduces the chances to have a detection . in order to estimate the coincident rate",
    ", one has to account for all the selection effects present in both gw and grb observations .",
    "this is not trivial as there may be overlaps between them .",
    "for instance sgrb jets should be directed toward the observer to have a chance to be detected with grb satellites , but source orientation also affect the strength of the gw signal . in this work ,",
    "we use monte carlo simulations that take into account the selection effects of both gw and sgrb observations , to provide realistic estimates on the rate of coincident gw / sgrb detections with both alv and et .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : mc_simul ] we present our simulations , in section  [ sec : efficiency ] we derive the coincident efficiency , in section  [ sec : rates ] we estimate the coincident rate , in section  [ sec : beaming_angle ] we propose a simple method to measure the average value of the sgrb beaming angle , and finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in order to investigate the expected rates of coincident detections of both gws and sgrbs we perform monte carlo simulations using distributions in the expected parameter values . fig .  [",
    "fig : flowchart ] shows a detailed flow chart of all the source parameters that are used in this work and how they relate to each other .",
    "we focus here on the population of primordial binaries ( pairs of massive stars that survived two core - collapses to form compact systems ) and neglect the population of dynamical binaries that may have been formed by captures in dense stellar environment and are not expected to contribute significantly to the total rate @xcite .",
    "short grbs are thought to be associated in majority with the coalescence of two neutron stars but it has been suggested that the merger of a neutron star and a black hole could also produce a beam of gamma - ray emission . since this scenario can not be excluded , we consider in this paper separately the two possible sources as the progenitors of sgrbs , binary neutron stars and neutron star - black holes . for each population , we first begin by drawing the source parameters , following a procedure similar to that described in @xcite .    * the redshift is drawn from a probability distribution @xmath6 ( see in fig .",

    "the cosine of the inclination angle , @xmath11 , is also drawn from a uniform distribution in the range of [ -1 , 1 ] . * the time interval between two successive events",
    "is given by the probability distribution @xmath12 , assuming coalescences in the observer frame is a poisson process .",
    "the average waiting time @xmath13 is computed from the inverse of the merger rate integrated over all redshifts .",
    "equivalently , we can consider that the coalescence time in the observer frame @xmath14 is a uniform distribution in the interval [ 0 , @xmath10 so as to represent one revolution of the earth about its axis .",
    "* for the initial set of simulations we consider a delta function for the distribution of the masses with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we will later consider the case of more realistic mass distributions . * in order to model the properties of sgrbs , we also set the beaming angle ( taken here as the half opening angle of the jet ) .",
    "we first investigate fixed angles covering a large range of values in the interval @xmath17 $ ] . as for the masses",
    ", we will consider use of a distribution of angles at a later stage . * the intrinsic peak luminosity @xmath18 ( in erg s@xmath19 ) is drawn from the standard broken power law distribution first proposed by @xcite : @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath23 erg s@xmath19 , corresponding to model ii of @xcite for primordial binaries , to which we have applied a factor of @xmath24 correction to convert @xmath25 in the band @xmath26 kev to the band @xmath27 kev used in this paper ( see section  [ grb_selection ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent work of @xcite difference in the results of @xcite since they used a larger energy band ( @xmath28 kev ) ] .",
    "we also consider a conservative value of @xmath29 erg s@xmath19 ( the lower bound of model ii of @xcite ) , which accounts for a possible extra bias arising if , among the observed sample of sgrbs , those with redshift measurement are the most luminous .",
    "we choose @xmath30 and @xmath31 , in order to cover more than @xmath32 of the luminosities .",
    "notice that taking @xmath33 as suggested by @xcite has a very small effect and does not affect the final results .",
    "we neglect in this work any possible evolution of the luminosity with redshift @xcite . *",
    "the log of the intrinsic duration of the burst , @xmath34 , is drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath35 and standard deviation @xmath36 , derived by fitting the sample of @xcite .",
    "we neglect here any possible correlation between the peak luminosity and the duration .      for each coalescence",
    "we must first determine if its resultant gw emission is detectable .",
    "for this purpose we calculate the event s coherent signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , for the detector network , in the ideal case of gaussian noise ( see @xcite for a more sophisticated scenario including the possibility of false alarms ) .    the snr detected by matched filtering with an optimum filter , in a detector labelled @xmath37 , is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the frequency of the gravitational wave in the observer frame , @xmath40 and @xmath41 the fourier transforms of the gw strain amplitudes of polarisations + and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 the antenna response functions to the gw polarisations , and @xmath45 the one - sided noise power spectral density ( psd ) of detector a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] ) .    for low mass systems such as bns or ns - bh ,",
    "the snr is dominated by the inspiral part of the signal and can reduce to : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the intrinsic chirpmass , a combination of the two component masses , @xmath48 is the luminosity distance , @xmath49 is the gravitational constant , @xmath50 is the speed of light , @xmath51 is the low frequency limit of the detector and @xmath52 is the observed ( redshifted ) gravitational - wave frequency of the last stable orbit .",
    "the factor : @xmath53 characterises the detector response .",
    "assuming uncorrelated noise , the combined snr for the network of detector is simply the quadrature sum @xmath54 of individual snrs .",
    "if @xmath55 is larger than a set snr threshold level ( @xmath56 ) then we say that the event is detectable .",
    "the first selection effect affecting the detection of sgrbs in em is the strong focussing of the ultra - relativistic jetted emission , i.e. the beaming angle @xmath57 . only the fraction @xmath58 of sources with inclination angle : @xmath59 can be observed on earth .    because of the small number of detections of afterglow associated with sgrbs",

    "the non detection of a jet break also provides lower limits on the jet opening angle between 5@xmath2 and 25@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "based on a sample of 79 lgrbs and 13 sgrbs @xcite propose a median of about 10@xmath2 .",
    "because of this uncertainty we use a wide range of values for the jet opening angle between 5@xmath2 - 30@xmath2 .",
    "the other obvious selection effects are related to the instrument : the burst can be undetected due to its faintness , to the fact that it is not located in the field of view ( fov ) , or because it occurs while the instrument can not record it .",
    "this last effect is dominated by passes through the southern atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , which reduce the duty cycle ( dc ) to @xmath61 of the total time . in the following ,",
    "we take the effects of the fov and the dc as independent factors reducing the probability of detection , independently of the source distance and spectrum .",
    "table [ tab : detect ] gives a summary of the characteristics of the detectors we have considered in this work .",
    "the trigger conditions can be complex , either for fermi or _",
    "swift_. for fermi , gbm triggers when two or more detectors exceed background by n sigma over t timescale in e energy band .",
    "to do so , 62 algorithms operate simultaneously with different value for the threshold above background , various timescales and energy bands .",
    "moreover , the energy and sensitivity threshold have been modified 8 times over 4 years as reported in the @xmath62 fermi - gbm grb catalog  @xcite .",
    "this resulted in a 20% difference in sgrb triggers over the period .",
    "for the _ swift _ satellite , based on the photon count rates , the complex trigger algorithm adopted uses hundreds of criteria to maximize the grb observations and cover the largest range of possible burst duration .",
    "each criterion uses different time ranges for the foreground periods and backgrounds , to find the accurate snr .",
    "if this snr passes the threshold , then the event will have to pass a slew of procedures to confirm its nature .",
    "because of the relative stability of the _ swift _ trigger conditions , we decided to use it as a reference for the sensitivity .",
    "a simple scaling relation can be use to relate swift and fermi rates .    in this work , we restrict the trigger selections to the condition :    @xmath63    where @xmath18 is the peak luminosity of a source at redshift @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the limiting flux for a sgrb detection , and @xmath66 is the k - correction due to the finite observation band at a given redshift .",
    "the limiting flux depends on the spectral properties of each trigger and also on whether it is seen on - axis or off - axis . for a generic sgrb defined by its peak energy @xmath67 kev and low and high energy spectrum power indices @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , the band law @xcite gives @xmath70 ph s@xmath19 @xmath71 for on - axis triggers in the @xmath72 kev observation band .",

    "in the following sections , we present the various selection effects described above in terms of efficiency , i.e. the fraction of sources , relative to the total , which can be detected at a given redshift .",

    "the relative position of the source with respect to the detector plane at the time of coalescence : a detector is most sensitive to a gw signal that propagates orthogonally to the plane of the detector , meaning that the signal will be affected by both the position in the sky and the time of arrival . * the second factor is the inclination angle , i.e. the angle between the normal of the source orbital plane and the observer s line of sight .",

    "as one can see , the coincident rate is very sensitive to the beaming angle @xmath57 . between a half jet opening angle of @xmath57=5@xmath2 and @xmath57=30@xmath2 , the rate increases by a factor of about @xmath154 .",
    "using the efficiency presented in fig.[fig : eff_flux ] , we roughly estimated that for our reference value of the local merger rate , the beaming angle , should be between @xmath155 in order to reproduce the actual observed rate of 8 sgrbs per year with _",
    "which is consistent with current models of the sgrb jet .",
    "this would favor a coincident rate between alv and _ swift _",
    "@xmath156 yr@xmath19 . increasing",
    "the local merger rate would shift the allowed range for the beaming angle toward lower values so that the final coincident rate would be unchanged .",
    "however , these estimates of the beaming angle should be considered with precaution due to the uncertainties associated with the intrinsic luminosity distribution derived by population synthesis from the small sample of observed sgrbs .    for",
    "et the gw coincident rates are presented in table  [ tab : rateset ] for a detector with a fov of @xmath85 sr , a duty cycle of 80% and and infinite flux sensitivity .",
    "this is of course unrealistic but it gives an upper limit of the number of coincidences in @xmath157 years . if the sensitivity of grb satellites do not improve in the next decade compared to _",
    "swift _ , the best one can expect is the _ swift _ rate of 8 detections a year .",
    "this is much better that the rates predicted for alv , but orders of magnitude below the et potential . as a matter of consequence",
    ", we note that the construction of et should be accompanied by the launch of a new generation of space observatories focussed on transient events .",
    "coincident gw / grb detections can help measuring , or at least putting strong constraints on the beaming angle of sgrbs @xcite .",
    "we propose here a very simple method to measure the average beaming factor and thus @xmath158 .",
    "the number of alv coincident triggers will be probably too small to do a parameter estimation , thus we consider only the case of et .",
    "we note that it is likely that a further enhancement of alv , or a new detector before et provide an intermediate case . for simplicity , we neglect ns - bh sources .    in the redshift interval @xmath159 ,",
    "the gw efficiency of et is almost 1 ( @xmath160 of the sources can be detected ) and we assume the sensitivity of the satellite is good enough so that only a negligible fraction of all the sgrbs is below the flux threshold ph  s@xmath19@xmath71 , we have @xmath32 of the sources above the threshold at a redshift of @xmath161 for instance ] .",
    "the efficiency of coincident detections is then equal to the average beaming factor ( times some factor due to the duty cycle and the fov ) and we can construct the estimator of @xmath162 : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the number of coincident detections and @xmath165 the number of gw detections alone , for @xmath64 in the bin @xmath166 $ ] .    in order to test our method",
    ", we consider a population of bns with local rate of @xmath167 mpc@xmath121 myr@xmath19 .",
    "using the sfr of @xcite , we obtain a total of @xmath168 gw over the operation lifetime of et we assume to be 10 years .",
    "we build the histogram of @xmath169 from a sample of @xmath170 simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histr ] ) and find that @xmath169 is a non - biased estimator of @xmath162 ( the average value @xmath171 converges to the true value ) with an error that depends on the average number of coincident sources in one simulation , and thus on the sfr , the local rate , the beaming angle , the duty cycle and the fov , and of course the time of observation .",
    "we confirm the result found in section 3.4.2 that a distribution of the beaming angle does not affect the number of coincident detections , and thus the beaming factor estimator .",
    "however , when the distribution of @xmath57 is not known , we can only measure the average value of the cosine .",
    "table [ tab : params ] gives the average value of @xmath169 and the standard deviation for the sfr of @xcite ( @xmath172 ) for @xmath173 and fixed angles of 5@xmath174 , 10@xmath174 and 15@xmath174 .    for different combinations of local rates , sfr , duty cycle and fov or time of observation @xmath175 , one should simply rescale the standard deviation as : @xmath176 with : @xmath177 where @xmath175 is in year and @xmath120 in mpc@xmath121 myr@xmath19 . for example",
    "the standard deviation should be multiplied by 3 for @xmath107=0.15 and @xmath109=0.8 .",
    "we have also studied the different distributions of @xmath57 used in iii.d and confirmed this result .",
    "in this paper , we have presented monte carlo simulations of coincident detections between gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors .",
    "we have assumed that sgrbs could be powered by bns or ns - bh coalescences and we have modeled the different selection effects of both gw and em detectors .",
    "we have calculated a coincident efficiency taking into account the fact that the source inclination affect both the gw and grb efficiency . besides the beaming angle and the grb satellite field of view , which are the most important effects , we have shown that the coincident sensitivity is limited by the gw detector horizon for the network of advanced detectors alv , while for et it is the grb flux threshold that is the most important .",
    "for alv the best grb satellite will be the one with the largest field of view , independently of the flux sensitivity , but for et , the most important gain will come from the improvement of the sensitivity . in order to roughly estimate the sensitivity required for such an `` optimized '' sgrb detector used for the follow - up of et , we have estimated that reducing the average flux limit to @xmath178 ph  s@xmath19@xmath71 over the next decade , would allow 80% of the sources at a redshift of @xmath135 ( corresponding to the end of the _ plateau _ of the coincident detection efficiency for bns ) to be above the threshold .",
    "the flux limit would have to be reduced to @xmath179 ph  s@xmath19@xmath71 to obtain 80% at @xmath180 , where we have the peak of the distribution of the redshift , and where the difference between dark energy equation of states cosmological models is more visible .    using a set of star formation rate models",
    ", we have calculated the coincident rate for different values of the beaming angle for alv and et .",
    "our results predict a small number of coincident detections with alv ( less than one event per year for the _ swift _ field of view of 1.4 sr and a duty cycle of 80 % ) , in agreement with recent studies ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of a sgrb counterpart , by increasing detection confidence , may allow for the reduction of the snr threshold .",
    "we have shown that using a threshold of 8 rather than 12 increases the number of coincident detections by a factor of 3 for alv .",
    "we have found a potential number of coincidences of @xmath181 per year for et assuming grb satellites can reach the desired flux threshold and a maximum fov of @xmath182 , but this number will reduce to a few events per year if the fov and the sensitivity do not improve compared to _ swift_.    finally we have proposed an original method to estimate the mean jet opening angle of sgrbs .",
    "this method can be applied to alv though with low sensitivity .",
    "the accuracy will improve as the sensitivity of the gw detectors enhance .",
    "the coincident rates could slightly increase by considering the population of dynamical binaries that could have formed by captures in dense environment and that could be numerous at low redshift due to the long delay between formation and coalescence @xcite .",
    "however we do not expect a big change and our findings emphasize the need of a dedicated , wide field of view , multi - wavelength follow - up of gw detections with a sensitivity increase by a factor 5 to 10 compared to current detectors .",
