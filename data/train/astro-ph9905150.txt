    "variability is a common characteristic of agn .",
    "most variability studies concentrate their attention on luminous seyfert  1 nuclei and qsos , which are known to develop prominent variations .",
    "but even among brands which classically have been regarded as quiescent , liners and seyfert  2 nuclei , there is an increasing number of reported cases of variations in both development of broad lines and increase of continuum luminosity .",
    "the recent discovery that ngc  7582 has mutated into a type  1 seyfert@xmath0 is perhaps one of the most puzzling cases .",
    "this classical seyfert  2 shows phenomenology that has been interpreted in support of unified schemes of agn@xmath1 : a sharp - edged [ o  iii ] outflow in the form of a cone is detected@xmath2 ; optical spectropolarimetry does not reveal any hidden broad line region ( blr ) , but since the far - ir colours @xmath3 m are very red , the absence has been taken in support for an edge - on thick torus able to block even the light scattered towards the observer@xmath4 ; indeed a large column density of neutral h also blocks the hard x - rays , implying a very large obscuration@xmath5 .",
    "the presence of stars in the nucleus is now firmly established .",
    "there is a steep gradient of   perpendicular to the [ o  iii ] cone , which reveals a 1  kpc disk of h  ii regions oriented at @xmath6 from the plane of the galaxy@xmath2 .",
    "the co absorption lines and large near - ir light - to - mass ratio are similar to those of h  ii galaxies and a factor of 5 larger than those of normal galaxies , indicating that red supergiants dominate the light of the inner 200  pc at those wavelengths@xmath7 .",
    "figure  i shows spectra of the nucleus of ngc  7582 as seen on january 6th 1994@xmath8 , the long known seyfert  2 stage that lasted until 1998 june 20th@xmath9 , and on july 11th , when it was discovered to have transited to a seyfert  1 stage@xmath10 .",
    "this type transition , if rare , is not unprecedented .",
    "three other classically classified seyfert  2 nuclei and one liner had suddenly developed broad lines in the past ( mrk  6 , mrk  993 and mrk  1018 and ngc  1097 ) , and seven seyfert  1 and a radio - galaxy lost their broad components and become seyfert  2 ( ngc  1566 , ngc  3516 , ngc  4151 , ngc  5548 , ngc  6814 , ngc  7603 , mrk  372 and 3c  390.3 ) .",
    "some of these transitions have been interpreted in the framework of capture and disruption of stars by a supermassive black hole@xmath11 or by a variable reddening in the dusty torus that hides the blr in seyfert  2@xmath12 . in the case of ngc  7582 these two interpretations conflict with the high extinctions measured for the thick dusty torus ( @xmath13  mag ) , that would block all the optical light coming from the surroundings of the black hole@xmath14 .",
    "we can thus say , that the mutation experienced by ngc  7582 defies the framework postulated by unified schemes .",
    "if the idea of a torus is to survive , the spectral change must be attributed to processes that occur around the torus , and which are not necessarily related to the central engine of the agn .",
    "an attractive alternative is to attribute this seyfert  1 activity to type  iin sn going off in the nuclear starburst detected at a radius @xmath15  pc @xmath7 .",
    "the spectra of sn  iin are characterized by the presence of prominent narrow emission lines ( hence the n ) sitting on top of broad components of up to fwhm@xmath16  km / s which look very similar to those of seyfert  1 nuclei and qsos@xmath17 , and do nt show the characteristic broad p - cygni signatures of standard sn .",
    "sn  iin are normally associated with regions of star - formation .    figure  ii shows a spectrum of sn  1988z , the best followed - up sn of this type , near maximum@xmath18 .",
    "this is an exceptionally bright and peculiar sn in its spectro - photometric properties : + @xmath19 it is characterized by an extremely slow decay of luminosity after maximum light , which makes it at day 600 approximately 5  mag brighter in @xmath20-band than standard type ii sn@xmath21 .",
    "+ @xmath19 it has a strong  emission , with peak luminosities of about @xmath22  erg  s@xmath23 ( for 50 ) at day 200@xmath18 .",
    "this prodigious luminosity is 5 orders of magnitude larger than that of sn  1987a .",
    "+ @xmath19 very high - ionization coronal lines ( e.g. [ fe x ] , [ fe xi ] ) are identified in the optical spectra , at least until day 492@xmath18 .",
    "+ @xmath19 at 2 to 20 cm it is one of the most powerful radio - sn in the sky , with peak - luminosities up to 3000 times that of remnants like cas  a@xmath24 + @xmath19 even 6  yr after maximum the sn shows a hard x - ray emission@xmath25 of more than @xmath26  erg  s@xmath23 + @xmath19 the total integrated energy radiated by this event in 8.5  yr of evolution is at least @xmath27  erg , and probably close to @xmath28  erg , in contrast with the canonical @xmath29  erg of standard sn@xmath30 .",
    "+ figure  iii shows a combined representation of the above properties . from this",
    "we derive that the output of energy is dominated by optical to x - ray emission , with a spectral energy distribution which strongly departures from the classical black - body fit of typical sn@xmath30 .",
    "these properties can be interpreted in the light of quick reprocessing of the kinetical energy released in the explosion by a dense circumstellar medium ( csm)@xmath31 , and thus explain the phenomenon as a young and compact supernova remnant ( csnr ) rather than as a sn .",
    "radiative cooling is expected to become important well before the thermalization of the ejecta is complete . as a result ,",
    "the shocked material undergoes a rapid condensation behind both the leading and reverse shocks .",
    "these high - density thin shells , the freely expanding ejecta and the still unperturbed interstellar gas are all ionized by the radiation produced in the shocks , and are responsible for the complex emission line structure observed in these objects .",
    "in the case of sn  1988z , a direct measurement of the csm density was possible@xmath21 .",
    "the value determined from the [ oiii ]  to [ oiii]forbidden line ratio in the early stages of the evolution is between @xmath32 and @xmath33  .",
    "the semi - analytical behaviour of a csnr@xmath34 in comparison with the data of sn  1988z is shown with lines in figures iii and vi .",
    "there is little doubt that if a sn  iin goes off in the center of a normal galaxy , the nucleus would be classified as a seyfert  1 while the prominent broad lines remain visible .",
    "in fact , there has been a succession of theoretical works that explain the phenomenology of lines and continuum at uv to near - ir wavelengths in seyfert  1 nuclei in terms of a starburst that undergoes sn  iin explosions ( see terlevich r.j . in this volume ) . from an age 1060  myr",
    ", a starburst sustains a sn  rate directly proportional to the blue light emitted by the stars in the cluster , with a value that is almost independent on the initial mass function@xmath35 : @xmath36    if we take the light evolution of sn  1988z as typical of the sn exploding in a cluster ( but beware that sn  iin show some heterogeneity in their light curves@xmath37 ) , we can construct some models to predict type transitions generated by sn  iin@xmath38 .",
    "figure  iv shows a monte carlo simulation of the light curve of a cluster of @xmath39 ( marked with a dashed line ) .",
    "the sn light evolution has been represented by the semi - analitical fit shown in figure  iii , and each sn explosion is marked with an arrow .    according to the photoionization models for csnr@xmath34 , the equivalent widths of  and  change in time from @xmath40  , @xmath41   for 4  to @xmath42  , @xmath43   for 8 , where  is the characteristic time of evolution of the csnr .",
    "if we adopt 20    as the observable limit below which an object is classified as a seyfert  1.9 ( in case @xmath44   but @xmath45  ) or a seyfert  2 ( in case @xmath46   ) , the transitions take place when the total light emitted by the cluster ( solid line in figure  iv ) is less than about 0.14 and 0.01  mag above the stellar level ( dashed line ) respectively .",
    "the activity level is recovered once the light curve crosses those limits in the opposite direction due to a new csnr .",
    "we can then estimate the time spent by these clusters as seyfert nuclei of types  1.9 or 2@xmath47 .",
    "the values obtained are just upper limits to the time spent in quiescent stages , since our approach ignores the secondary pulses that occur in the evolution of csnr due to cooling instabilities .",
    "the less luminous systems are the ones that experience longer quiescent stages . in low - luminosity systems ( @xmath48  mag ) the low sn rates derived ( @xmath49  yr@xmath23 )",
    "gives non negligible time scales for states in which no csnr could contribute to the existence of broad lines in the spectrum , and thus transitions between seyfert types 1 and 2 can be possible .",
    "figure  v compares the luminosity of the transient agn as compared with that theoretical limit , which lies above the measured luminosities .",
    "the luminosity of the inner 3  arcsec of ngc  7582 before the transition is @xmath50  mag .",
    "the luminosity profile at this stage is not very peaked , as shown in hst images , where the luminosity of the nucleus changes by 3  mag when using apertures ranging from 0.5 to 0.1  arcsec .",
    "the stellar populations of the nucleus at optical wavelengths are best represented by old ages ( @xmath51  myr ) contaminated in a 12%  by a reddened @xmath52  mag starburst@xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic luminosity of the starburst nucleus is about @xmath54  mag and the sn rate must then be @xmath55  yr@xmath23 .",
    "if all the sn explosions generate sn  iin , there is a 33% probability of having detected a transition to a seyfert  1 stage in the last 30  yr .    in order to investigate this possibility for the origin of the broad lines , profile and light evolution might be of interest .",
    "figure  vi plots the evolution of the  line width and luminosity of ngc  7582 as a function of time compared with the values of sn  1988z@xmath30 and the seyfert  1 ngc  5548@xmath56 .",
    "the data of ngc  7582 was obtained from various eso telescopes@xmath14 in la silla , chile , and from the 2.1 m in cananea , mexico ( previously unpublished data ) .",
    "the spectra were internally flux - calibrated to the same relative scale using [ n  ii ] and , independently , also [ o  iii ] .",
    "the zeros in the time axis of figure  vi for the comparison are uncertain .",
    "we have opted to match the light curves of sn  1988z , ngc  7582 and ngc  5548 at the maximum in  light .",
    "this also matches the minimum in the light evolution of ngc  5548 as the onset of the elementary unit of variation in seyfert  1 nuclei@xmath57 .",
    "all fluxes have been normalized to the maximum value .",
    "the line - width evolution of ngc  7582 closely resembles the early evolution of sn  1988z , if the similarity of flux evolution is not clear due to the scarcity of the data . at these early stages ,",
    "large deviations from the semi - analytical solution of the evolution of a csnr , represented as a dashed line , are expected due to the formation and collision of the shell structures generated by the outer and reverse shocks as they sweep circumstellar and ejected material@xmath34",
    ". however , these light oscillations predicted by theory are as yet unchecked in real sn  iin .",
    "these oscillations are however clearly present in the behaviour of the light evolution of typical seyfert  1 nuclei , as ngc  5548 represented with dotted lines .",
    "if the event seen in ngc  7582 is a csnr in the nuclear starburst region , a behaviour similar to sn  1988z and the peak of ngc  5548 represented in figure  vi is expected .",
    "a close multi - wavelength monitoring of this object is thus required if we want to elucidate the mechanism that has created the broad - lines despite the supposedly still existing thick torus that blocks the inner nuclear region from the line of sight .",
