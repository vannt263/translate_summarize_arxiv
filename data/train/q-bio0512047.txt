    "icosahedral symmetry plays a fundamental role for the structure of viruses because it constraints the organisation of the proteins in the viral capsids that protect the viral genome .",
    "based on this observation , caspar and klug have developed a landmark theory @xcite in which they derive a family of icosadeltahedra , i.e. polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry and faces given by equilateral triangles , that act as blueprints for the organisation of viral capsids .",
    "in particular , the corners of the triangular faces of these polyhedra encode the locations of the protein subunits in the capsids .",
    "this implies that proteins are organised in clusters of 5 or 6 protein subunits , called _",
    "pentamers _ and _ hexamers _ , respectively .",
    "the polyhedra consist of @xmath0 triangular facets , where @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 denotes the _ triangulation number _ that parameterises the family of polyhedra . as a consequence ,",
    "there are precisely 12 pentamers and @xmath4 hexamers in a viral capsid corresponding to the polyhedron of triangulation number @xmath5 in this family , and the corresponding capsid contains @xmath6 protein subunits .",
    "the family of polyhedra established in caspar - klug theory is fundamental in virology and has a plethora of applications ranging from image analysis of experimental data to the construction of assembly models . despite its huge success experimental evidence",
    "has shown that it is too restrictive to account for all known viruses .",
    "in particular , viruses in the family of papovaviridae fall out of the scope of caspar - klug theory and their organisation has therefore been a long - stand open problem in virology @xcite , which has been formulated by liddington et al . in 1991 as follows :  the puzzle is how do the coloured pentamers fit into the hexavalent holes ? \" . in particular , the experiments show that also the protein clusters located off the global 5-fold axes of icosahedral symmetry can be pentamers , which is by construction excluded by the approach of caspar and klug because they are working with a hexagonal lattice .",
    "we have provided a solution to this puzzle based on tiling theory in @xcite , where we have constructed a polyhedron that describes the surface structure of the viral particles observed in @xcite . by construction , these models not only encode the locations of the protein subunits but also those of the inter - subunit bonds that connect different pentamers in the capsid .",
    "these results have provided the basis for the construction of assembly models for papovaviridae in @xcite , and the tiling approach has moreover paved the way for the study of crosslinking structures @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to develop a mathematical framework for the systematic construction of polyhedra associated with viral capsids composed of pentamers throughout , and hence to derive a family of polyhedra that constitute the exceptional cases needed to complement the caspar - klug series of polyhedra for the description of viruses .",
    "since we are seeking polyhedra that encode the locations of pentamers off the 5-fold axes of the icosahedral group , it is not possible to work with a hexagonal lattice as in the case of the caspar - klug construction , and a completely different mathematical approach is hence required .",
    "in particular , the coordinates of the vertices have to be retrieved from an icosahedral lattice , i.e. a lattice that is invariant under the action of the icosahedral group .",
    "such a lattice does not exit in three dimensions , but can be inferred from a six - dimensional space via projection .",
    "this procedure is known from the study of aperiodic structures @xcite , which describe the locations of atoms in alloys called quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "an additional complication arises due to the fact that such projections only lead to discrete point sets if the number of lattice points projected from the higher - dimensional space is restricted in an appropriate way .",
    "we use here a restriction that is rooted in the structure of the icosahedral group itself , and can be obtained via a so - called affine extension of that group .",
    "it can be used to construct a family of finite dimensional point sets that act as blueprints for the coordinates of the desired polyhedra .",
    "we obtain three types of polyhedra in this way that correspond to the three species of particles observed in the family of papovaviridae",
    ". the ratios of their radii are completely determined by the mathematical formalism , so that there exists only one scaling parameter that relates the geometries of all polyhedra collectively to the biological setting .",
    "it can be used to test the predictions of our theory as we discuss in section [ appl ] .",
    "the smallest polyhedron in the series is a triacontahedron , and we therefore call our series of exceptional polyhedra the _ triacontahedral series_. the 30 faces of the triacontahedron are rhombs . by subdividing each rhomb into two triangles , it can be seen that the triacontahedron is structurally similar to the @xmath7 capsid in caspar - klug theory . however , the coordinates of the vertices are of a different type : while the coordinates of the triacontahedron can be obtained from a higher - dimensional icosahedral lattice via projection , this is not the case for the @xmath7 caspar - klug structure . moreover , the vertices of the polyhedra in the triacontahedral series are located on nested spherical shells rather than a single spherical shell , so that these particles are only approximately spherical . for example",
    ", the triacontahedron has 12 vertices ( corresponding to an icosahedron ) located on one shell and 20 vertices ( corresponding to a dodecahedron ) located on a different shell within .",
    "the polyhedra corresponding to the medium and large sized particles have vertices on three different nested shells",
    ". the vertices at which 5 faces meet mark the centres of the pentamers , and the locations of the protein subunits correspond to the angles of the corresponding faces . in combination with the tiling approach citetwarock:2004a ,",
    "twarock:2005a it is moreover possible to deduce the bonding structure of the viral capsids they represent as we discuss in section [ appl ] .",
    "our mathematical set - up moreover provides a framework for the study of the scaling transformations and rotations that map the coordinates of the polyhedra on other points induced from the higher - dimensional icosahedral lattice by projection .",
    "this is important because viral capsids are three- rather than two - dimensional objects , and these transformations can be used to associate a three - dimensional structure with the two - dimensional surfaces of the polyhedron that provides the blueprint for the capsid .",
    "this has been demonstrated in @xcite for the case of human rhinovirus .",
    "the viral capsid of this virus follows the blueprint of our small shell , the triacontahedron .",
    "it has been shown in this reference that the viral capsid is contained between two copies of the triacontahedron that are related by a scaling by the irrational number @xmath8 , which corresponds to a transformation of the type we are considering here . in section [ scale ] we show how these transformations can be derived within our formalism for all viruses in the triacontahedral series .",
    "this paves the way for a construction of three - dimensional structures associated with the blueprints provided by the polyhedra for all viruses in this series , and hence to derive the locations also of the proteins that are located within the capsid and delimit the cavity filled by the genetic material .",
    "such information is invaluable for example for the study of scaffold mediated assembly .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ proj ]",
    "we outline the projection formalism that connects a generalised lattice ( or quasi - lattice ) based on the simple root vectors of the non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath9 with the root lattice of @xmath10 . in section [ nest ] we derive finite dimensional subsets of this generalised lattice based on an affine extension of the non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath9 . in section [ const ]",
    "we use these sets for the construction of the triacontahedral series of polyhedra .",
    "the projection picture is extended in section [ scale ] and a formalism is established that allows us to determine the range of possible scaling transformations , rotations and combinations thereof that map the vertices of the polyhedra on other points in the generalised lattice obtained via projection , because this provides the basis for the construction of three - dimensional models associated with these polyhedra along the lines of @xcite .",
    "a comparison with experimental results is provided in section [ appl ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of the mathematical and biological implications of our results .",
    "we are seeking polyhedra that are symmetric under the icosahedral group . since the icosahedral group does not stabilize a lattice in three dimensions , a 3-dimensional generalised lattice or quasi - lattice has to be inferred from a higher dimensional crystallographic lattice via projection .",
    "we use the fact that the icosahedral group is crystallographic in 6 dimensions , and construct our quasi - lattice from the root lattice of @xmath10 via projection .",
    "we remark that it would also have been possible to construct a quasi - lattice in three dimensions via a projection from @xmath11 rather than @xmath10 as in @xcite . however , our approach is more general , because the root lattice of @xmath10 allows for an embedding with maximal symmetry @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the standard basis in 6 dimensions with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the root lattice of @xmath10 corresponds to the @xmath16-linear span of the 6 simple root vectors ( or roots in short ) of the coxeter group @xmath10 .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of the standard basis @xmath17 as follows : @xmath18    we choose a projection to 3 dimensions that maps the basis @xmath17 on the vectors pointing to the six non - aligned vertices of an icosahedron .",
    "the coordinates of these vectors are given in terms of the 3 dimensional standard basis below , using @xmath19 : @xmath20    hence , by virtue of ( [ roots_a ] ) and ( [ eproject ] ) , the vectors @xmath21 , @xmath15 , project on the vectors in ( [ aproject ] ) .",
    "coordinates are again expressed in terms of the standard basis in 3 dimensions , with the notation @xmath22 for the galois conjugate of @xmath23 and the identity @xmath24 :    @xmath25    @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the root vectors of the non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath9 .",

    "they encode the generators of the coxeter group @xmath9 as follows .",
    "let @xmath41 and let @xmath42 denote the scalar product in @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath43 is the euclidean reflection in the plane orthogonal to the root vector @xmath44 .",
    "the icosidodecahedron representing the root system @xmath39 and two of the reflection planes that are encoded by the root vectors are illustrated in fig .",
    "the intersection of the two planes in the figure corresponds to an axis of 5-fold symmetry , which intersect with the sphere at two of the 12 5-fold vertices of a ( spherical ) icosahedron .",
    "the other reflection planes are not shown , but their intersections with the surface of the sphere are indicated as geodesics ( i.e. as spherical arcs obtained as intersections of planes through the centre of the sphere with the surface of the sphere ) .",
    "the intersections of the geodesics mark the locations of all symmetry axes , and one can hence reconstruct the locations of all 6 five - fold , 15 two - fold and 10 three - fold axes of rotational symmetry of the icosahedral group .        note that in contrast to the case of weyl groups @xmath45 $ ] ( instead of @xmath16 ) for all @xmath44 , @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16-linear combinations of root vectors in @xmath39 do not form a crystallographic lattice , and @xmath39 is therefore called _ non - crystallographic_. however , it is possible to select subsets which form generalised lattices such as the quasi - lattices known from quasicrystals @xcite .    in order to extend the root system in a way compatible with overall icosahedral symmetry the basis of simple root vectors has to be extended . for this",
    ", we use the fact that the relations between the simple root vectors are encoded in the cartan matrix @xmath47 ,    @xmath48    we extend this matrix by an additional row and column via a formalism known as affine extensions in the theory of kac - moody algebras .",
    "the only difference here is that entries stem from the set @xmath34 $ ] rather than @xmath16 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the affine extended cartan matrix of @xmath9 is given by @xmath49 the additional row and column encode a further root vector corresponding to an affine reflection that acts as a translation @xmath5 by the highest root vector @xmath50 .",
    "the three other reflections are cyclic operations of order two and the products of any two of them correspond to rotations around the origin as follows : @xmath51 the affine extended group is hence generated by the three reflections @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the translation @xmath5 .",
    "it is now possible to construct , based on these operations , finite point sets with icosahedral symmetry such that all points in the sets have a counterpart in the root lattice of @xmath10 . in this sense",
    ", they are finite subsets of generalised lattices induced by projection from @xmath10 and correspond to potential candidates for the locations of the polyhedra we are seeking .",
    "the point sets are generated iteratively via the action of the generators of the extended group on the origin @xmath55 .",
    "if the action of the translation operator @xmath5 is not restricted , one obtains an infinite point sets that densely fills @xmath33 .",
    "however , if @xmath5 acts only a finite number of times , n say , while the action of all other operations is not restricted in order to guarantee icosahedral symmetry of the overall configuration , finite dimensional point sets @xmath56 are obtained which become larger and more dense with increasing @xmath57 .    due to the fact that @xmath5 acts as a translation by the highest root vector it has been possible to derive a simple expression for the point sets @xmath56 in terms of the root system @xmath39 @xcite : @xmath58 in particular , @xmath56 consists of all @xmath59-linear combinations of up to @xmath57 root vectors in @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath57 is called the _ cut - off parameter _ because it limits the number of points in the set .",
    "the sets @xmath56 play a crucial role in the following for the construction of the polyhedra .",
    "by construction , the sets @xmath60 contain the vertices of the polyhedra in the triacontahedral series .",
    "due to the fact that we are looking for polyhedra that represent viral capsids given in terms of pentamers that are ( with a certain experimental error ) equidistant from their neighbouring pentamers , the vertices of the desired polyhedra follow ( in a good approximation ) the vertices of the platonic and archimedean solids , because they correspond to the polyhedra with equidistant edge lengths .",
    "they can hence be used as templates for the search of the coordinates of the polyhedra within the sets @xmath60 . moreover , since we are looking for polyhedra that mark the locations of pentamers , only those platonic and archimedean solids are relevant that have 5-coordinated vertices , i.e. vertices at which 5 edges meet .",
    "the three solids that fulfil this criterion are the icosahedron , the snub cube and the snub dodecahedron .",
    "we have computed the sets @xmath60 up to @xmath61 explicitly .",
    "the points are organised on 181 nested shells of radii between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 contains all point sets @xmath60 with @xmath65 by construction , and has been chosen because it is sufficiently dense to provide coordinates for the polyhedra .",
    "we have used the icosahedron , the snub cube and the snub dodecahedron , respectively , as a template to search for subsets of @xmath64 with the desired distribution of points .",
    "we have thus obtained those coordinates of our polyhedra , that mark the locations of 5-coordinated vertices .",
    "we have then determined further vertices ( not necessarily on a shell of the same radius ) which together with these vertices from the vertex set of the polyhedron .",
    "the procedure is discussed explicitly in the following subsections for the individual cases and the coordinates of the vertices corresponding to centres of pentamers are provided in the appendix .",
    "the vertex set of the icosahedron occurs for the first time in the set @xmath66 on a shell of radius @xmath67 .",
    "there are two ways of obtaining polyhedra that match this vertex set .",
    "one of them is the icosahedron itself and corresponds to the start of the caspar - klug series .",
    "the other one is the rhombic triacontahedron with 30 rhombic faces .",
    "the remaining vertices of this polyhedron correspond to the vertices of a dodecahedron located on shell of a radius @xmath68 ( i.e. there is a scaling factor of about 1.098 between the shells that contain the two different types of vertices ) .",
    "the triacontahedron is shown in fig .",
    "[ triac ] .",
    "since only those vertices at which 5 faces meet mark the locations of pentamers , both cases correspond to capsids with 12 pentamers located on the axes of 5-fold symmetry of the icosahedral group .",
    "however , only the centres of the pentamers coincide in both cases , and the _ orientations _ of the pentamers are _ different _ : because the proteins are located in the corners of the faces ( shown schematically as dots in fig .",
    "[ rotate ] ) they differ by a rotation by an angle of @xmath69 as illustrated in this figure .",
    "it shows a face of the icosahedron with three protein subunits on the left versus three faces of the triacontahedron on the right with 2 protein subunits each .",
    "a superposition of both figures shows that the respective proteins are rotated with respect to each other .     with respect to the locations of the proteins on the rhombs ( right).,width=188 ]",
    "this difference has far - reaching consequences for the structure of the capsids .",
    "in particular , in one of the cases crosslinking structures are possible while they can not occur for geometrical reasons in the other case , as has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the case of the triacontahedron is hence essentially different from the @xmath70 case in the caspar - klug family and marks the start of a different series of polyhedra .      due to the fact that the snub cube has octahedral rather than icosahedral symmetry",
    ", we need to use the geometric inclusions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ inclusions ] in order to locate its vertices within the point set @xmath64 .",
    "the points of @xmath64 that are closest to the vertex set of the snub cube occur on a shell of radius @xmath71 , which appears in @xmath72 for the first time ( i.e. it is not contained in a set @xmath60 with @xmath73 ) .",
    "the edges are not equidistant in the case of the snub cube as expected , but the deviations are small . in particular , one obtains the following values for the three different distances @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath47 between neighbouring points in the set .",

    "the line denoted as @xmath47 is centred on a global two - fold axis of the symmetry group .",
    "the face containing that edge is hence 2-fold symmetric about that axis .",
    "we compute the intersection of this axis with the edge @xmath47 , and determine a line that goes through that intersection point , is perpendicular to @xmath47 and intersects the sphere in two points equidistant from the intersection point .",

    "a third type of vertex is located on the global 3-fold axis , that is indicated as an encircled 3 in fig .",
    "[ octtri ] .",
    "there is flexibility in the construction in that the vertices on the global 3- and 4-fold axes do not need to be located on a shell of the same radius as the vertices representing pentamers .",
    "however , due to the fact that they are not marking locations of pentamers , their exact location is not important for our purpose .",
    "it is important to note though that a variation of the radii of the shells on which they are located causes changes in the angles of the faces .",
    "one hence obtains the polyhedron illustrated schematically in fig .",

    "the fundamental domain of the octahedral group corresponds to the triangle between the 2-fold , 3-fold , and 4-fold axes marked as encircled 2s , 3s and 4s in fig .",

    "therefore , only a part of the polyhedron overlapping with the fundamental domain is shown , because the rest of the polyhedron is implied by symmetry .",
    "it is a schematic representation in that the vertices not marking the locations of the pentamers have been drawn on the same shell .",
    "however , this illustration shows all features of the polyhedron that are needed to read off the locations of the protein subunits , which are located in those corners of the faces that meet in multiples of 5 at a vertex .",

    ". this fact may account for the experimental observation that viral particles corresponding to such a polyhedron have only been obtained in vitro , but have never been observed in vivo .",

    "it would be interesting to validate also the predictions for the bonding structure of the other species experimentally .",
    "the results in this paper provide answers to the two open mathematical questions stated in the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "firstly , we have addressed the question of how the series of polyhedra that starts with the triacontahedron and contains all polyhedra corresponding to all - pentamer configurations , can be completed . for this , we have derived a mathematical method that combines a projection of the root lattice of @xmath10 with an affine extension of the non - crystallographic coxeter group @xmath9 in order to determine finite subsets of generalised lattices that encode the vertices of these polyhedra . in this way , we have been able to establish the triacontahedral series that complements the family of polyhedra in caspar - klug theory .",
    "secondly , the mathematical formalism developed here provides a framework for the systematic analysis of crystallographic scaling transformations and rotations for polyhedra with vertices in the triacontahedral series .",
    "these are important as they can be used to associate three - dimensional structures with the blueprints provided by the surface structures of the polyhedra as demonstrated in @xcite for the case of human rhinovirus , which corresponds to the small particle in our tricontahedral series . in this respect ,",
    "our results pave the way for an analysis of the interior organisation of all viral capsids corresponding to the triacontahedral series .    from the biological point of view",
    ", our triacontahedral series closes an important gap because it complements the series of caspar - klug polyhedra .",
    "similar as the in the case of the caspar - klug series , this paves the way for a broad spectrum of applications in virology .",
    "in particular , due to the fact that papovaviridae contain cancer - causing viruses , a better understanding of their structure is highly desirable to assist the development of new anti - viral drugs .",
    "for example , based on the structure of the polyhedra it is possible to develop assembly models that explain how viral capsids self - assemble from their capsid proteins . the theory developed here",
    "provides a framework for the generalisation of earlier work @xcite to the case of simultaneous assembly of different species of particles .",
