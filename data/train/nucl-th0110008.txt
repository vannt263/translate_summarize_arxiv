    "this three - body @xmath63be@xmath67 calculation gives about 1.5 mev less binding for @xmath55be than the four - body calculation does .",
    "the difference is due to the @xmath35 correlations which are absent in the three - body calculation , and which are built in within the yakubovsky equations of the four - body calculation .",
    "the other calculations mentioned above @xcite found smaller values , not exceeding 0.5 mev , for the binding - energy gain due to having a four - body calculation for @xmath55be .",
    "an obvious merit of our four - body faddeev - yakubovsky calculation is that it automatically accounts for _ all _ possible rearrangement channels in the @xmath62 system . in particular , by breaking up @xmath68be into two @xmath19 s in the four - body calculation , substantial attraction is gained due to several additional bound subsystems such as the @xmath53he - @xmath19 and @xmath69he - @xmath69he clusters which almost saturate the corresponding rearrangement channels ( @xmath29 ) - @xmath19 and ( @xmath70 ) - ( @xmath70 ) , respectively .     in mev ) for @xmath53he in a three - body @xmath29 model , and for @xmath18be in a four - body @xmath62 model and in a three - body  @xmath68be @xmath71 model .",
    "the origin of the dashed axes corresponds to @xmath72.,height=245 ]    our calculations confirm , if not aggravate , the incompatibility of the ` old ' experimental determination of the binding energy of @xmath53he @xcite with that of @xmath73be @xcite .",
    "the ` new ' experimental determination of the binding energy of @xmath74he @xcite is found to be still incompatible with that of @xmath73be , even if an unobserved @xmath75 deexcitation involving either @xmath73be@xmath76 or @xmath66be@xmath76 is allowed for ; one of these possibilities , involving @xmath66be@xmath77 at 3.1 mev @xcite , is recorded in table [ tab : tabl3 ] . since no particle - stable excited states are possible for @xmath74he or for its @xmath20 hypernuclear core @xmath69he , and since @xmath74he is also ideally suited for three - body cluster calculations such as the @xmath17-wave faddeev equations here solved for the @xmath78 system , we continue by discussing the implications of accepting the e373 kek experiment @xcite determination of @xmath60  @xmath79  mev for @xmath74he .",
    "we have shown that model nsc97 is the only one capable of getting close to this ` new ' binding - energy value , short by about 0.5 mev .",
    "in fact , we estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our faddeev calculation for @xmath74he as bounded by 0.5 mev , and such that a more precisely calculated binding energy would be _ larger _ by a fraction of this bound , at most , than the @xmath80 values shown in table [ tab : tabl3 ] . taking into account such possible corrections",
    "would bring our calculated @xmath80 values to within the error bars of the reported @xmath80 value .",
    "there are two possible origins for this theoretical uncertainty , one which was already mentioned above is the restriction to @xmath17-waves in the partial - wave expansion of the faddeev equations ; the other one is ignoring the off - diagonal @xmath81 interaction which admixes @xmath5 components into the @xmath74he wavefunction .",

    "figure [ fig : lxi ] demonstrates that @xmath85he is particle - stable for potentials simulating the nsc97 model .",
    "the mirror hypernucleus @xmath4h is unstable because the @xmath91 hyperon is heavier by 6.5 mev than @xmath92 .",
    "our prediction for the stability of @xmath4he would hold valid , particularly for potentials simulating model nsc97@xmath32 ( and also @xmath34 ) , even if the binding energy of @xmath93he is increased by a fraction of an mev to scale it with the recently reported @xmath2he binding energy @xcite .",
    "however , if the @xmath37 ws potential depth is set equal to that for @xmath5 in @xmath46b @xcite , @xmath85he would become unstable by a fraction of an mev in version @xmath32 .",
