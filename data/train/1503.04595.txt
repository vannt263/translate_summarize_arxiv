    "non - polar nematic phases , where only quadrupolar and octupolar orders can coexist , were studied in @xcite , where the reader is also referred to for a rather accurate and informative review of earlier contributions to theory .",

    "an octupolar tensor is simply described by @xmath2 scalar parameters , and so its generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the plane must be so constrained as to be described by @xmath2 parameters only .",
    "it was indeed shown here that in the two - dimensional case all generalized eigenvalues of an octupolar tensor are equal ( to within a sign ) and that its three inequivalent eigenvectors are described by a single rotation angle .",
    "it will be shown in @xcite how the @xmath1 independent parameters that describe an octupolar tensor in three space dimensions concur to either the _ three _ or _ four _ inequivalent generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors which are associated in the generic case with the maxima of the octupolar probability density and the directions along which they are attained .",
    "a critical voice could be raised against the mathematical machinery devised here to describe the multipoles of the probability density @xmath9 in .",
    "comparing @xmath57 , @xmath77 , and @xmath155 above , one could easily argue that the multipoles in are nothing but the fourier components of @xmath9 in @xmath5 .",
    "such a critique could indeed be grounded if the angle @xmath158 were indeed the same in all the formulae where it appears , which would the case if the vectors @xmath46 , @xmath67 , and @xmath160 were somehow _ locked _ , that is , rigidly related to one another , which they are _",

    "diagonalized _ form for an octupolar tensor was established in , which unfortunately has no analogue in three space dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the method proposed here to identify the scalar order parameters of an octupolar tensor could be extended to any space dimension , whereas the diagonal form in is only accidentally valid in two space dimensions .",
