    "quasi - two - dimensional crystalline organic metals and superconductors are very flexible systems in the study of many - body effects and unusual mechanisms for superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "their `` soft '' lattices enable one to use relatively low pressures to tune the same material through a variety of low - temperature groundstates , for example from mott insulator via intermingled antiferromagnetic and superconducting states to unusual superconductor  @xcite .",
    "pressure also provides a sensitive means of varying the electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions , allowing their influence on the superconducting groundstate to be mapped  @xcite .",
    "the self - organising tendencies of organic molecules means that organic metals and superconductors are often rather clean and well - ordered systems , enabling the fermi - surface topology to be measured in very great detail using modest magnetic fields  @xcite ; such information can then be used as input parameters for theoretical models  @xcite . and",
    "yet the same organic molecules can adopt a variety of configurations , leading to `` glassy '' structural transitions and mixed phases in otherwise very pure systems  @xcite ; these states may be important precursors to the superconductivity in such cases  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , there seem to be at least two ( or possibly three ) distinct mechanisms for superconductivity  @xcite in the quasi - two - dimensional organic conductors .",
    "the first applies to half - filled - band layered charge - transfer salts , such as the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 packing arrangements of salts of the form ( bedt - ttf)@xmath0x , where x is an anion molecule ; the superconductivity appears to be mediated by electron correlations/ antiferromagnetic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism applies to _ e.g. _ the @xmath6 phase bedt - ttf salts  @xcite ; it appears to depend on the proximity of a metallic phase to charge order  @xcite .",
    "finally , there may be some instances of bcs - like phonon - mediated superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their invaluable role in mapping the bandstructure , high magnetic fields allow one to tune some of the organic conductors into some new and intriguing phases ; examples include field - induced superconductivity  @xcite and exotic states such as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the remainder of this paper , we shall describe two recent observations of field - induced phases in crystalline organic metals , one of which is related to the fflo but which results in an insulating state , and the other of which exhibits properties reminiscent of those of a superconductor , but via an entirely different mechanism .",
    "denote the resistive upper critical field for two different samples ( see inset for an illustrative example ) .",
    "the @xmath7 points , denoting the phase boundary between the mixed phase and fflo state were deduced using simultaneous mhz differential susceptibility measurements ; the change in vortex stiffness that accompanies entry into the fflo state causes an `` elbow '' in the field - dependent susceptibility .",
    "`` sample 3 '' is a measurement on a third sample under different conditions of electric field ; consistency of the phase boundaries for the three samples shows that the effect is not due to artefacts of vortex pinning .",
    "the curves are a theoretical model due to shimahara for the upper critical field and fflo ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details).,width=340 ]",
    "intense magnetic fields ( @xmath8 ) impose severe constraints on spin - singlet paired electron states .",
    "superconductivity is one example of a groundstate where this is true , although orbital diamagnetic effects usually destroy superconductivity at lower magnetic fields than does spin - splitting  @xcite .",
    "charge - density wave ( cdw ) systems , by comparison , are mostly free from orbital effects  @xcite , and so can only be destroyed by coupling @xmath8 directly to the electron spin .",
    "while most cdw systems have gaps that are too large to be destroyed in laboratory - accessible fields  @xcite , several new compounds have been identified within the last decade that have gaps ( @xmath9 ) as low as a few mev , bringing them within range of the static magnetic fields at the national high magnetic field laboratory .    as we shall discuss in section",
    "[ three ] , ( where @xmath10k , tl or rb ; @xmath11  mev ) is one example that has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "however , it has a complicated phase diagram in a magnetic field owing to the imperfect nature of the nesting  @xcite ; closed orbits exist after the fermi - surface reconstruction which become subject to landau quantization in a magnetic field  @xcite , potentially modifying the groundstate .",
    "by contrast ,  ( where m = pt and au ) appears to be fully gapped  @xcite",
    ". however , the existence of spin @xmath12 moments on the pt sites makes only the @xmath13au system a pristine example of a small - gap , fully dielectric cdw material .",
    "measurements of the cdw transition temperature @xmath14 ( where the subscript `` p '' stands for `` peierls '' ) in   ( @xmath15  k at @xmath16 ) as a function of @xmath8 indicate that it is suppressed in a predictable fashion  @xcite , allowing a pauli paramagnetic limit of @xmath17  t to be inferred .",
    "however , the closure of the cdw gap with field is in fact considerably more subtle  @xcite ; a finite transfer integral @xmath18 perpendicular to the nesting vector produces a situation analogous to that in an indirect - gap semiconductor , where the minimum energy of the empty states above the chemical potential @xmath19 is displaced in @xmath20-space from the maximum - energy occupied states below @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "consequently , landau quantization of the states above and below @xmath19 is possible , leading to a thermodynamic energy gap @xmath21 of the form  @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the temperature - dependent cdw order parameter ( @xmath24 as @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 is a characteristic cyclotron frequency in the limit @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a nonparabolicity factor ; @xmath29 is the land g - factor and @xmath30 is the bohr magneton .",
    "note that the landau quantization _ competes _ with zeeman splitting ; however , at sufficiently high @xmath8 it becomes impossible to sustain closed orbits , leading to a straightforward dominance of the zeeman term  @xcite .",
    "another subtlety in assessing the field - dependent thermodynamic gap ( and hence the pauli paramagnetic limit ) in  stems from the complicated nature of the low - temperature electrical conductivity , which contains contributions from both the sliding collective mode of the cdw and thermal excitation across the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) )  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a measured resistivity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the conductivity due to thermal excitation across the gap and @xmath33 is the contribution from the collective mode , @xmath34 being the current density and @xmath35 the threshold field . now",
    "[ gapfield ] contains @xmath36 , which is @xmath37-dependent ; moreover , @xmath35 may also depend on @xmath37 .",

    "<S> after a brief introduction to crystalline organic superconductors and metals , we shall describe two recently - observed exotic phases that occur only in high magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the first involves measurements of the non - linear electrical resistance of single crystals of the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) system ( per)@xmath0au(mnt)@xmath0 in static magnetic fields of up to 45  t and temperatures as low as 25  mk . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a fully gapped cdw state with typical cdw electrodynamics at fields higher that the pauli paramagnetic limit of 34  t suggests the existence of a modulated cdw phase analogous to the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , measurements of the hall potential of single crystals of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath0khg(scn)@xmath2 , made using a variant of the corbino geometry in quasistatic magnetic fields , show persistent current effects that are similar to those observed in conventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the longevity of the currents , large hall angle , flux quantization and confinement of the reactive component of the hall potential to the edge of the sample are all consistent with the realization of a new state of matter in cdw systems with significant orbital quantization effects in strong magnetic fields .    </S>",
