    "the gram determinants of a real binary tensor of format @xmath1 ( @xmath2 times ) are an @xmath2-tuple of quadratic invariants of the tensor .",

    "the semi - algebraic description determines whether a tuple lies in the gram locus or its complement , and characterizes tuples on the boundary .",
    "the non - linear part of the boundary of the gram locus is figure [ fig1 ] , and it is depicted in the highest higher order singular value coordinates in figure [ fig3 ] . examining tensors on the boundary gives a counter - example to a conjecture stated in section 1 of @xcite : example [ counter ] is a tensor which lies on the boundary of the feasible set , but whose higher order singular values in each flattening are distinct .",
    "its singular values are located at the black dot in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "conjecture [ conj : main ] proposes the general form for the gram locus .",

    "* problem 1.6 ) , characterizing the tensors whose higher order singular values coincide . in the case of matrices , agreement of singular values implies orthogonal equivalence .",
    "theorem [ 2x2x2 ] shows that the hyperdeterminant bridges the gap between orthogonal equivalence of tensors and the higher order singular value decomposition in the @xmath6 case .",
    "the @xmath6 tensor format is described in the following example .",

    "it has three flattenings , each of size @xmath9 : @xmath10 for the @xmath11th flattening @xmath4 we find @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , the first gram determinant is    @xmath13 @xmath14    a computation reveals that the linear combination @xmath15 can be written as a sum of three squared terms : @xmath16 the sum - of - squares certificate certifies that the expression is non - negative for all real values of the variables .",

    "each principal flattening is a matrix with two rows and @xmath17 columns , obtained by combining the indices from all but one direction . denoting the rows by vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the gram matrix is @xmath20 its determinant is given by the cauchy - schwarz expression @xmath21 .",
    "for the @xmath11th flattening , this is the @xmath11th _ gram determinant _ , denoted @xmath22 . by the cauchy - binet formula , it is the sum of squares of the @xmath23 minors of the @xmath11th flattening matrix .",

    "the map @xmath25 sends a real binary tensor to its tuple of @xmath2 gram determinants : @xmath26 @xmath27 the map scales by a constant factor under rescaling the input tensor .",
    "we define the _ gram locus _ to be the image @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the unit ball of tensors whose norm does not exceed one : @xmath30    each gram determinant @xmath22 is a polynomial of degree four in the entries of the tensor ; the map @xmath25 is given by @xmath2 homogeneous degree four polynomials .    the gram determinant map @xmath25 gives the higher order singular values of a binary tensor , as follows .",
    "the higher order singular values of a tensor , introduced in @xcite , are the singular values of its @xmath2 principal flattenings , the non - negative square roots of the eigenvalues of the @xmath2 gram matrices .",
    "just as the singular values of a matrix describe it up to orthogonal change of basis , via the singular value decomposition ( svd ) , the higher order singular values give the corresponding multilinear structure of a tensor , via the higher order singular value decomposition ( hosvd ) .",
    "the trace of any gram matrix , @xmath31 , is the sum of the squares of the entries of the original tensor , its squared frobenius norm , hence is unchanged by the choice of flattening .",
    "thus the higher order singular values from the @xmath11th flattening are the non - negative solutions to the univariate polynomial in @xmath32 : @xmath33 therefore , the map that sends a binary tensor to its higher order singular values is obtained by composing @xmath25 with @xmath2 maps @xmath34 the first coordinate of this map sends @xmath22 to the largest higher order singular value in that flattening . characterizing feasible combinations of higher order singular values is an open problem @xcite . in this paper",

    "the size of the tt format required to represent a tensor is given by the ranks of the flattenings obtained by grouping the first @xmath36 indices for the rows , with the remaining indices forming the columns , for @xmath37 .",
    "a tensor being representable by a tt format with deficient @xmath36th bond dimension is equivalent to the determinant of that flattening vanishing .",

    "the faces account for 12 of the 18 minors .",
    "the remaining six are unique to one flattening .",
    "they are the shaded crimson squares in figure  [ 3f ] .",
    "the six crimson minors have monomials @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are multi - indices in @xmath74 that differ in all three coordinates .",
    "each such term is determined by the two other indices in the term whose first index is zero , so it is represented by a vertex in figure [ square1 ] .",
    "the edges connect monomials that appear in the same minor .",
    "the three gram determinants are denoted @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . as in the statement of theorem [ conv ] , we aim to show that @xmath78 the other inequalities follow from @xmath79 by relabeling .",
    "example [ ex1 ] gives a sum - of - squares certificate for the non - negativity of @xmath79 .",
    "below we carry out the sum - of - squares computation using the notation of the proof of theorem [ conv ] .",
    "each determinant is already given by a sum - of - squares expression , and we show how to absorb the subtraction of @xmath75 into the expressions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the minors come in two types : the faces of the cube have monomials @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 differ in two indices , and the crimson minors have @xmath72 and @xmath73 differing in all three indices .",
    "we write @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the minors whose monomials differ in @xmath82 indices .",
    "we find a sum - of - squares certificate for the two pieces @xmath83 and @xmath84 individually .",

    "the monomials in @xmath104 are of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 differ in all four indices .",
    "as in example [ neq3 ] , we can label the vertices of a three dimensional cube by such terms , by writing the indices that occur after the zero in the term that starts with a zero .",

    "hence the determinants of the corresponding gram matrices both evaluate to @xmath43 . for all other flattenings , @xmath116 and",
    "the gram determinant is zero .",

    "this implies that the true convex hull of the gram locus contains the one in the statement of the theorem .",
    "it remains to show that all other points are outside the image of the map .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the gram determinants @xmath22 of a real binary tensor satisfy the inequality @xmath118 [ lineard ] each gram determinant @xmath22 of a tensor @xmath114 is the sum of squares of the @xmath23 minors of the @xmath11th flattening of @xmath114 .",

    "for the induction step , we relate @xmath132 , where @xmath146 , to @xmath133 and @xmath84 .",
    "we saw above that the polynomial @xmath128 consists of monomials @xmath71 with multi - indices @xmath147 .",

    ", the monomial @xmath148 appears in @xmath132 . for such monomials ,",
    "the second variable is uniquely determined by the first .",
    "we label the monomials in @xmath132 by @xmath149 according to the @xmath142 indices that appear after the @xmath111 in the term that starts with a @xmath111 .",
    "these are the @xmath17 vertices of the following graph .",
    "we build an edge between two vertices labeled by @xmath72 and @xmath73 if @xmath150 and @xmath151 appear in the same term in some @xmath137 , @xmath152 .",

    "we write @xmath202    we now write the third flattening in terms of vectors @xmath199 and @xmath200 . we write @xmath203 , where the entries of @xmath199 are arranged according to the value of the third index :",
    "@xmath204 are those entries of the tensor with a 0 in their third index , and @xmath205 are those with a 1 in their third index .",
    "similarly for @xmath200 . we can then write the third flattening as @xmath206 just as for the second flattening , we have organized the columns of the third flattening according to the value of the first index .",
    "so the matrix is formed of two rank one matrices concatenated side - by - side .",
    "this implies that there exists vectors @xmath207 and @xmath208 such that @xmath209 the term @xmath210 appears in a sum - of - squares certificate for @xmath119 , for all @xmath72 and @xmath73 , as follows .",
    "let @xmath82 be such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 differ in @xmath163 indices .",
    "projecting to the @xmath82 indices consisting of these and the first two , we obtain one of the combinations of six minors from @xmath132 depicted in figure [ sg ] .",
    "hence it must be zero . substituting in our expression in for the entries of the tensor yields the equation @xmath211 where the entry of @xmath207 corresponding to multi - index @xmath72 is denoted @xmath212 , and likewise for @xmath208 .",
    "hence one of @xmath207 and @xmath208 must be zero , which contradicts @xmath198 being full rank , or @xmath213 which shows that @xmath214 is rank one , and hence @xmath215 , as required .",
    "the following example shows that the above inequalities in the gram determinants do not always hold for tensors of size @xmath216 with some @xmath217 .",
    "consider the @xmath218 tensor with entries @xmath219 a computation shows that @xmath220 while @xmath221 .",
    "this tensor can be appropriately included into larger tensor formats to show the result for fixed larger sizes .",
    "we seek a semi - algebraic description for the gram locus , the image of @xmath28 .",
    "we begin with the case @xmath222 , where @xmath223 and @xmath224    we first find the zariski closure of the boundary of the image @xmath28 . following the approach in @xcite ,",
    "this is contained in the branch locus of the map @xmath25 and that of its restriction to the boundary @xmath225 .",
    "these branch loci are @xmath226 and @xmath227 respectively , obtained by direct computation ( using the boxed code on page 14 ) : @xmath228 @xmath229 @xmath230 the polynomial @xmath231 is the non - linear part of the boundary , depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the zariski closure of the boundary of @xmath28 is contained in the vanishing locus of @xmath226 and @xmath227 , @xmath232 .    the image @xmath28 is the closure of the union of some connected components in @xmath233 : each connected component is either contained in the image , or disjoint from it .",
    "hence it suffices to consider components contained inside the convex hull of @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath46 ^ 3 \\backslash v(q)$ ] has five connected components .",
    "the connected component containing @xmath234 , for @xmath235 sufficiently small , intersects the set @xmath236 , hence by theorem [ conv ] it is not contained in the image .",
    "there are three such components by symmetry .",
    "the interior of the surface @xmath237 is contained in the convex hull of the image .",
    "likewise for the component containing the point @xmath238 , for @xmath235 sufficiently small .",
    "a direct computation finds tensors that map to each connected component of @xmath46 ^ 3 \\backslash v(pq)$ ] in these two last pieces , hence they are the image @xmath28 .",
    "it remains to find the semi - algebraic description .",
    "the interior of the surface @xmath237 is given by @xmath239 .",
    "the surface @xmath240 meets the plane @xmath220 along the planar curve @xmath241 with multiplicity two .",
    "imposing that all three such polynomials , obtained by relabeling , be positive yields the component of @xmath242 ^ 3 \\backslash v(q)$ ] containing the point @xmath238 .",
    "polynomials @xmath226 and @xmath227 from the proof of theorem [ thm : neq3 ] are computed in macaulay2 as follows .",
    "computational speed - ups are obtained by changing coordinates from the @xmath243 , the eight entries of the array , to coordinates @xmath244 that are invariant under the orthogonal group @xmath245 .",
    "the variables ` di ` refer to the determinants , while ` t ` is the trace of any flattening .",
    "section [ 1 ] shows how to convert determinantal constraints to the higher order singular value coordinates . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors work in the three - dimensional space of the highest singular values from each flattening .",
    "the image of @xmath246 in these coordinates is depicted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the point of the star near @xmath247 is the true algebraic description for the experiments with random tensors in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 3.1 ) .",
    "conjecture [ conj : main ] describes , for @xmath63 , the image @xmath28 inside the cube @xmath242^n$ ] by the single polynomial inequality @xmath59 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy with the @xmath56 case can be understood by evaluating @xmath248 when all @xmath249 .",
    "we obtain @xmath250 the value of @xmath55 is @xmath111 for all even @xmath2 . among odd @xmath2 , the difference @xmath248 grows in @xmath2 , and is positive for all @xmath251 .",
    "hence the connected component of the complement of @xmath252 containing the point @xmath238 , for some small @xmath235 , is the same as the piece @xmath253 for all @xmath63 .",
    "the sufficiency of conjecture [ conj : main ] has been tested for one million tensors , with @xmath254 .",
    "the boundary of the gram locus @xmath28 contains parts of all the hyperplanes @xmath249 .",
    "if a tensor of norm one lies on the hyperplane @xmath249 , its singular values in the @xmath11th flattening are both @xmath255 and , in particular , are the same",
    ". however , the following example shows that not all tensors on the boundary of the gram locus have two singular values the same in some flattening . since the change of coordinates given by equation does not map boundary points to the interior , this disproves the conjecture stated in section 1 of @xcite .",
    "[ counter ] consider the tensor @xmath256{2 } } , \\qquad t_{101 } = t_{011 } = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2 } - \\frac{1 } { 2 \\sqrt{2 } } } , \\quad t_{ijk } = 0 , \\text { otherwise } .\\ ] ] its tuple of gram determinants , @xmath257 lies on the part of @xmath237 that contributes to the boundary of @xmath28 .",
    "the higher order singular values are : the square roots of @xmath258 and @xmath259 , for flattenings one and two , and the square roots of @xmath255 and @xmath260 in the third flattening .",
    "it is labeled in figure [ fig3 ] by a black dot which can be seen to lie on the boundary hypersurface .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of the fibers of the gram determinant map @xmath261 each fiber is defined by @xmath2 non - homogeneous quartics in the space of binary tensors .",
    "it consists of a union of orbits under the orthogonal equivalence action for binary tensors , @xmath262 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.2 ) .",
    "dimension counting reveals that the quotient @xmath263 has dimension exponentially sized in @xmath2 .",
    "recall from section [ 1 ] that , for tensors of fixed norm , the gram determinant map @xmath25 corresponds to the map sending a tensor to its higher order singular values .",
    "hence , while in the matrix case the singular values define a matrix up to orthogonal equivalence , the same is not true of tensors and their higher order singular values .",
    "the hyperdeterminant is the unique ( up to scale ) @xmath264 invariant .",
    "it is given by the formula @xmath265",
    "@xmath266 @xmath267 theorem [ 2x2x2 ] says that if two tensors are related by a change of basis and have the same higher order singular values , they are related by an _",
    "orthogonal _ change of basis .",
    "the result extends to tensors of multilinear rank @xmath268 by projecting to the minimal subspaces . letting @xmath269 , the fibers of the map @xmath270 are the equivalence classes of tensors under the @xmath245 orthogonal equivalence action .",
    "successful extension of theorem [ 2x2x2 ] to higher @xmath2 would yield a summary of tensors up - to - orthogonal - equivalence .",
    "we lastly consider the map that sends a tensor of general format @xmath271 to its higher order singular values , the singular values of each principal flattening . given a fixed tensor @xmath272 , the tensors @xmath273 in the same fiber as @xmath272 are those whose @xmath11th principal flattening is orthogonally equivalent to the @xmath11th principal flattening of @xmath272 , for all @xmath274 .",
    "in particular , the first flattening is orthogonally equivalent to the first flattening of @xmath272 , hence @xmath275 . repeating for all @xmath274",
    ", we obtain that the fiber is exactly those tensors @xmath273 for which @xmath276 however , the element of the group @xmath277 will be different for each @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , @xmath278 so tensors in the same fiber , which also differ by the same matrices in each flattening , are actually orthogonally equivalent .",
    "we can only express the fiber as the above intersection of @xmath2 orbits , not as a single orbit .",
    "it is an open problem to extend theorem [ 2x2x2 ] to larger tensor formats : to add minimal additional invariants such that the fibers are single orthogonal equivalence classes .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor bernd sturmfels for helpful discussions .",
    "thanks also to jan draisma for information about an orthogonally invariant basis for @xmath6 tensors , and to andre uschmajew and nick vannieuwenhoven for useful comments .",
