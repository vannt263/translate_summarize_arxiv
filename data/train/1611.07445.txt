    "<S> the atomically - projected density of states ( pdos ) in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the fermi level is within the gap gap , close to the valence band top , so that transport in via tunnelling . as such </S>",
    "<S> , the transmission coefficient , @xmath60 , is reduced in the energy range of the gap [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](c , d ) ] , and the main features are the same for gpg and pgp , as well as for the p and ap configurations . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , for the gpg junction there is a significant energy interval @xmath610.3 ev around @xmath4 , where the p configuration has significantly higher @xmath62 than the ap one , resulting in the large tmr of 50 - 100% [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03](c , d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the pgp junction the tmr does not display such an extended plateau but rather shows an oscillating energy dependance , and exactly at @xmath4 there is a tmr sign reversal when compared to the gpg case . </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by an energy range above @xmath4 where tmr@xmath630 and then another region with significant tmr corresponding to the bottom of the gap conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> such oscillating character of the tmr in the pgp junction suggests that the actual value may be sensitive to the exact details of the atomic interfaces , while for the gpg case it can be expected to be robust .    in order to obtain further insights we compare the transmissions for the two junctions , @xmath64 , at the fermi level as a function of the transverse @xmath65 vector resolved over the entire first brillouin zone ( bz ) ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we note that in both cases there are vast regions of the brillouin zone , where @xmath66 ( blue areas in the transmission panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a direct consequence of the low dos in the cumnas electrodes around @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04](a ) one can immediately observe that the regions of @xmath67-space with @xmath66 essentially corresponds to regions where there are no open scattering channels at the fermi level . interestingly and at variance with the case of fe / mgo junctions , such property interests also the bz center .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig04 ]    it is also interesting to note that the spin - polarized transmission , defined as @xmath69}$ ] , shows that for different pockets in the bz the spin of the current - carrying electrons is opposite . for example , for the gpg junction and p configuration </S>",
    "<S> the electrons have up - spin for the pockets close to the bz center , while they have down - spin for the pockets at the bz boundary . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the ap configuration the pockets at @xmath70 have up spins , while the ones at @xmath71 have down spins , so that the four - fold rotational symmetry in the @xmath72 plane is broken . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the gpg structure breaks the symmetry in the @xmath72 plane , since the ga - p bonds at the two interfaces are @xmath73-rotated with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the strong influence of such asymmetry on the transmission suggests a strong contribution of @xmath74-orbitals around @xmath4 .    in the supporting information ( si ) we provide a detailed analysis of the @xmath67-dependent </S>",
    "<S> pdos around @xmath4 , and we find evidence that , while for the gpg structure the transmission properties are mainly driven by bulk - like features , for the pgp one they are determined by interface states . </S>",
    "<S> the interface mn layer has positive fermi level spin polarization for the p alignment , while for the ap configuration the interface mn has negative spin polarization , and only in the second layer the mn moment is positively polarized . the effective tunnelling distance for each spin - configuration for the bulk - like states of gpg </S>",
    "<S> is therefore increased for the ap configuration compared to the p one , so that one expects a smaller conductance for the ap in this case .        </S>",
    "<S> [ fig05 ]    finally , we look at the pdos at the fermi level and in particular the spin - pdos , which we define as the pdos difference for the spin - up and spin - down states  } $ ] , where @xmath75 is the spectral function for each spin component @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the ks solutions of the open - boundary problem corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath78 . ] as a function of the atomic position starting from the center of the junction ( see fig . [ fig05 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find the staggered fermi - level spin - pdos at the mn atoms which is in fact oppositely polarized to the on - site spin ( condensate ) at each mn atom ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , there is a notable difference between the two junctions . </S>",
    "<S> for both the pgp and gpg stacks the spin - pdos curves for the p configurations and for one of the ap are identical </S>",
    "<S> . however , the curve for the remaining ap configuration ( c@xmath79r ) has a cumulative spin - pdos with opposite sign for the gpg junction and with the same sign for the pgp . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the gpg stack the spin polarization induced inside the spacer around each interface carries the same sign as the mn atom at the interface , while this is not the case for the pgp junction in the ap state . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the tmr in the gpg structure resembles the conventional tmr of ferromagnetic junctions as described by the jullire model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig05](d ) that the pdos for majority and minority spins swap as the non - compensated spin - polarization reverses in the right - hand side lead between the p and the ap state .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that stacks made entirely of anti - ferromagnets display staggered spin - transfer torques when the current flows in a perpendicular to the plane orientation . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is little affected by surface termination and strongly suggests that the antiferromagnetic order parameter can be manipulated by currents . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such junctions exhibit pronounced magnetoresistance , which is intrinsic of having asymmetric stacks . in particular here we have demonstrated that for cumnas / gap structures a ga - cu termination enhances the magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> our work thus demonstrates that all - antiferromagnetic junctions are both readable and writable with an electrical current , and therefore are interesting candidates as high - frequency high - density memory elements .      </S>",
