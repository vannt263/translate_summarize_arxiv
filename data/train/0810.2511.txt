    "studies of dewetting , rupture and pattern formation in thin liquid films are very important for advanced technologies and also present an interest for basic physical sciences .",
    "however , most experimental and theoretical results have been obtained for aqueous and polymer films .    in this paper",
    "we report on our modeling studies of a metallic film dewetting by pulsed laser irradiation ( pli ) . in the experiments on laser - irradiated metal films by bischof _",
    "@xcite , both generic scenarios of dewetting and rupture were observed , i.e. by the growth of surface perturbations ( spinodal regime @xcite ) and by nucleation and growth of holes @xcite . very recently , several groups reported the results of similar experiments on thinner films ( thickness @xmath0 nm ) that are irradiated by a single pulsed beam @xcite , as in bischof _",
    "et al . _ , as well as by two or more interfering pulsed beams ( pulsed laser interference irradiation , plii ) @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate that dewetting in such films is primarily spinodal .",
    "the process of dewetting is analyzed in the cited papers using a thermal transport modeling @xcite and the standard isothermal thin film pde @xcite .",
    "the consensus is that dewetting is driven by a long - range intermolecular ( van der waals ) forces and the thermocapillary forces , with negligible material evaporation .",
    "most interestingly , in the plii mode the same static interference picture is formed on the film surface at each pulse ( i.e. , the alternating lines of the hot and cold regions in two - beams plii , or the rectangular grid of the hot and cold lines in four - beams plii ) . through the thermocapillary fluid flow",
    "such lateral spatial nonuniformity of the temperature field allows the fabrication of one and two - dimensional lattices of metal nanoparticles .",
    "while the general picture has been laid out quite clear in the cited papers , there have been no attempts to develop a consistent pde - based model of dewetting in a metallic film system , which incorporates thermocapillarity and the spatial and temporal nonuniformities due to laser irradiation .",
    "presentation of such model is the subject of this paper .",
    "the model allows the studies of dewetting , rupture and nanopatterning in 3d films for a set of laser parameters , such as the pulse shape and repetition frequency , the power intensity of the radiation , the arrangement and separation distance of the interference fringes , and the strength of interference .",
    "it must be noted here that the influence of radiative heating on fluid dynamics was theoretically studied only in a handful of papers @xcite .",
    "most notably , oron & peles @xcite studied thermocapillary flows and instabilities of evaporative thin aqueous films with constant internal heat generation .",
    "oron @xcite expanded this study to the case of irradiation by a single continuous - wave laser beam .",
    "grigoriev @xcite analyzed mechanisms of passive and active feedback control of evaporatively driven instabilities in irradiated thin films .",
    "the primary conclusion of these studies , which are based on long - wave theory , is that irradiation can partially suppress the growth of instabilities .",
    "also , ajaev and willis @xcite studied axisymmetric dewetting and rupture , in a molten state , of a thin metallic film , which has been melted by a single energetic laser pulse with a gaussian spatial shape .",
    "they accounted for evaporation and long - range intermolecular attraction to the substrate and identified the thermocapillary stresses as the major driving force of a film evolution .",
    "it must be noted that neither of these papers considers nonuniform irradiation or the film reflectivity .",
    "the latter , as has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite is often the quantity of key importance for the dynamics of the ultrathin metallic films .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we formulate the equations of fluid motion for a film irradiated by pli or plii , and then obtain the temperature field in the long - wave approximation . using this field , we derive the 3d long - wave evolution pde for the surface height . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we perform the linear stability analysis of the 2d surface of the film and the numerical simulations of the 2d surface dynamics .",
    "we show how the surface stability , surface shape , rupture time and nanostructure array formation are affected by key dimensionless parameters , such as the film optical thickness , peak laser beam intensity , number of incident pulses and their duration , marangoni and biot numbers , and by the lateral spatial nonuniformity of the heat production in the plii mode .",
    "also we compare the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of stability and dewetting in the systems with zero and nonzero reflectivity .",
    "section [ sec5 ] contains the discussion and conclusions .",
    "in the pli or plii experiments , the solid film is periodically melted by a laser pulse . following refs .",
    "@xcite we disregard periodic cycles of the melt resolidification between laser pulses and assume , for the purpose of the analysis and nonlinear dynamical simulations of the dewetting process , that the metallic film is always in the molten ( i.e. , liquid ) state .",
    "this is reasonable , since it has been shown that the mass transport in the solid state is negligible compared to the one in the liquid state , and so is the film deformation @xcite . in other words , our model assumes that between the laser pulses the film cools down to the temperature that is just above the solidification temperature , and thus it always stays liquid . correspondingly , the dewetting process is treated as a continuous one in simulations .",
    "thus we assume a thin film of an incompressible newtonian liquid lying on a planar horizontal substrate .",
    "the mean height of the film , @xmath1 , is assumed much smaller than the lateral dimension @xmath2 , thus @xmath3 .",
    "the surface tension @xmath4 is a linear function of the temperature @xmath5 , @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the melting temperature of the film , @xmath8 is the surface tension at the melting temperature , and @xmath9 .",
    "the tildes mark dimensional quantities .",
    "the governing equations of the melt are the navier - stokes , continuity , and the energy equations : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity field , @xmath14 is the full stress tensor for incompressible fluid , @xmath15 is the viscous stress tensor , @xmath16 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath17 is the density , @xmath18 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath19 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath20 is the internal heat source . the internal heat generation is due to the absorption of radiation from the monochromatic laser beam .",
    "we assume ( i ) that the free surface of the film is optically smooth , non - scattering , and non - emissive , and ( ii ) that the solid substrate supporting the film is black ( which rules out reflections from the film - substrate interface ) .    under the stated assumptions the form of the heat source term is given by bouguer s law @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the laser power intensity , @xmath23 is the spatially uniform optical absorption coefficient , @xmath24 is the position of the free surface , @xmath25 is reflectivity and @xmath26 is a positive function with mean value one whose functional form depends on the interference mode and the temporal shape of the laser pulse .",
    "the boundary conditions at the free surface @xmath27 are :    * the normal and shear stress balances : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unit outward normal to the surface , @xmath31 is the unit tangent vector , and @xmath32 is the disjoining pressure .",
    "the latter is specified in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the hamaker constants .",
    "the first term is due to the dispersion ( van der waals ) forces and the second term is due to the contributions from the kinetic energy of the electrons @xcite . *",
    "the kinematic condition : @xmath36 that balances the normal component of the liquid velocity with the speed of the interface .",
    "* the temperature boundary condition is given by the newton s law of cooling : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the heat transfer coefficient and @xmath39 is the air temperature .",
    "+    the boundary conditions for velocity of the melt flow at the solid boundary @xmath40 ( the substrate ) are no - slip , @xmath41 , and no - penetration , @xmath42 .",
    "two types of the temperature boundary condition at the substrate will be considered .",
    "the boundary condition of the first type ( tbc1 ) is the newton s law of cooling at @xmath40 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the heat exchange coefficient and @xmath45 is the temperature of the substrate . note that the usual case of a fixed temperature at the solid boundary , @xmath46 ( which corresponds to perfectly conducting substrate ) can be easily obtained .",
    "it suffices to take the limit @xmath47 ( or equivalently , the limit @xmath48 , see the definition of @xmath49 below ) in the dimensionless expressions for the temperature and in the evolution pde for the film height .",
    "it is clear from the form of these equations that this limit exists and that taking the limit results simply in some terms dropping out of the equations .",
    "the boundary condition of the second type ( tbc2 ) is the continuity of the temperature and the thermal flux at @xmath40 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the temperature field in the substrate .",
    "the substrate is assumed thin , @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is substrate thickness ) .",
    "thus the temperature field @xmath51 can be derived in the lubrication approximation .",
    "we use the following scalings to nondimensionalize the problem @xcite : @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the characteristic flow velocity .",
    "typical values of the material parameters are shown in table i.      upon using the scalings , the dimensionless energy equation is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the peclet number , @xmath63 is the brinkman number , and @xmath64 is the optical thickness of a film of the uniform thickness @xmath1 for the incident radiation with the mean penetration length @xmath65 .",
    "using values of the material parameters from table i gives @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "if the film is irradiated uniformly , the temperature remains uniform in any horizontal plane in the film ( top rows of the figures ) , but for spatially nonuniform irradiation the temperature in the film follows the shape of the intensity distribution as shown in the bottom rows of the figures .    if the optical thickness @xmath93 the radiation passes through the film and such films are called optically thin or transparent . if @xmath94 the radiation penetrates only into a very thin boundary layer adjacent to the free surface of the film and in this case the film is called optically thick or opaque .",

    "note that @xmath194 depends on the amplitude of the initial surface perturbation .",
    "naturally , perturbations with larger initial amplitude rupture the film faster . in the nonlinear dynamical simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ sp_uniform ] the rupture time for @xmath199 is approximately @xmath200 ms , which corresponds to the dimensionless time @xmath201 .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ lin_nl ] that at the initial stage of the irradiation the nonlinear instability growth rate matches the one predicted by the linear stability analysis , but towards the end of the simulation the nonlinear instability grows much faster .",
    "this can be explained by observing that when the film height gets small the factor @xmath202 in eq .",
    "( [ e0refl ] ) becomes very large , signaling that the destabilizing van der waals component of the disjoining pressure dominates over stabilizing forces , which results in a faster instability growth .",
    "we also noticed that smaller values of the capillary number , @xmath111 , sometimes result in a ring rupture , meaning that the film surface touches the substrate some distance from the vertical line through the minimum of the perturbation .",
    "such rupture leaves behind an array of small liquid drops @xcite .",
    "_ @xmath95 as in eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) .",
    "_ the shape profile obtained by irradiating the surface with a single pulse of width @xmath203 ( @xmath204 dimensional pulse width ) is similar to the one resulting from uniform laser beam heating ( fig .",
    "[ sp_uniform ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath205 in this case , which is less than the rupture time for the uniform heating .",
    "the reason is that the energy absorbed from the gaussian beam is less than the energy absorbed from the uniform irradiation , which causes the rapid growth of the instability leading to fast rupture .",
    "_ @xmath95 as in eq .",
    "( [ np ] ) . _    in this simulation we use several sequences of gaussian pulses . in each sequence , pulses have same width and also the repetition frequency of pulses is same for all sequences .",
    "[ np ] shows the rupture time vs pulse width .",
    "the surface morphology is similar to the one obtained by uniform laser beam heating .",
    "it can be seen that the rupture time increases as the pulse width increases . again",
    ", this is because the energy generated from a narrower pulse is smaller than the energy generated from a wider pulse , and this increases the growth rate of the instability .",
    "heating the film surface with wider pulses also require more number of pulses for the film to rupture .",
    "for example , 3064 pulses are enough to get the film ruptured when irradiated with a 1ns pulse , compared to 3293 pulses required for a 50ns pulse irradiation . it must be noted here that in any irradiation mode the rupture time increases approximately linearly with the peak intensity @xmath22 .",
    "this effect can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ omegarefl ] ) and ( [ cutoffrefl ] ) .",
    "indeed , larger @xmath22 does not change the magnitude of the fourth ( destabilizing ) term there ( see the definitions of the parameters @xmath206 and @xmath207 in the table ) , but it increases the stabilizing contribution of the last term .",
    "the inclusion in the model of weak evaporation and the corresponding recoil pressure at the free surface should partially reverse this trend @xcite .",
    "_ @xmath95 as in eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) . _ fig .",
    "[ twobeam ] shows the film profile after the two - beams irradiation , together with the interference field profile , i.e. the function @xmath208 .",
    "values of the parameters are @xmath209 and @xmath136 .",
    "the ruptures first occur in the low temperature regions , while the strong heat generated in the high temperature regions makes the film surface stay near the equilibrium position @xmath87 .",
    "the rupture time is @xmath210 , which is comparable to the time estimate given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath211 for a 10nm - thick film ) .",
    "if the irradiation is stopped immediately after the first ruptures occur , the solidification that follows is expected to create the regular array of metallic ridges ( nanowires ) with the axes along the @xmath212-direction .",
    "in contrast to fig . [ sp_uniform ] where the irradiation is uniform , here the ridges have different volume , with the large ( small ) volume in the cold ( hot ) regions .",
    "thus the ridges volume distribution has the period @xmath189 of the interference imprint .",
    "this distribution is qualitatively consistent with the plii experiments and modeling @xcite . since the bulk film temperature is higher for thicker films ( fig .",
    "[ maxt_brefl ] ) , then increasing the film height from 10 nm to 15 nm eliminates most ridges , except the one in the destructive regions ( the bottom figure in fig .",
    "[ twobeam ] ) .",
    "( note that scales are very different along the @xmath131 and @xmath173 axes in figs .",
    "[ sp_uniform ] and [ twobeam ] , thus the true cross - section of each ridge is closer to the circular than it appears . )",
    "it must be noted that by nature of this model the substrate is exposed only at the points of film rupture between the ridges in the cold regions , while in the experiment each ridge terminates at the substrate . in other words ,",
    "the simulation with this model ca nt be continued for @xmath213 and thus we ca nt predict how the mass will be re - distributed if the irradiation persists . +        finally , in fig .",
    "[ comptr_r ] we plot the ratio of the rupture times , @xmath214 vs. @xmath155 for the case ( tbc2 ) .",
    "the simulations were done , in each case , with the most dangerous wavenumber @xmath215 ( for @xmath216 and @xmath217 the most dangerous wavenumbers are different ) .",
    "it can be seen that this ratio is less than one for all values of @xmath155 and changes non - monotonously with @xmath155 , decreasing first and then increasing .",
    "the minimum value is as small as @xmath218 .",
    "the ratio is less than one because the reflectivity reduces the heat generation in the film ( eq .",
    "( [ source ] ) ) , thus reducing the stabilization .",
    "note that , since the simulation is started with the small surface deformation ( such that the predictions of the linear stability theory are valid for at least some time ) , the ratio does not give meaningful comparison in the interval @xmath219 .",
    "this is because the surface is linearly stable for @xmath216 and @xmath217 when @xmath219 , as shown in fig .",

    "in this paper we study the dewetting dynamics of a pulsed laser - irradiated metallic films .",
    "a lubrication - type model describing the flow of a molten film and the heat conduction in the film is developed .",
    "the heat absorbed from the laser beam is included as a source term in the heat conduction problem and the temperature field distribution in the film is obtained by solving this problem analytically . in the laser interference mode of irradiation",
    ", we observe that the lateral temperature distribution in the film mimics the shape of the lateral power intensity distribution of the laser .",
    "the temperature difference across the film and the temperature in the film are higher for optically thick films than for the optically thin ones .",
    "the temperature field is used to derive the 3d long - wave evolution pde for the film height . in order to get clear understandings of the film dynamics",
    ", we study the 2d version of the equation by means of the linear stability analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "the linearized problem allows us to investigate the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of various system parameters .",
    "higher peak intensity of the beam and larger marangoni number @xmath160 either delay the rupture time of an initially perturbed film or make the perturbation decay , while smaller surface biot number @xmath83 and substrate biot number @xmath49 have the same effect .",
    "the increasing optical thickness @xmath155 can have either stabilizing or destabilizing effect , depending on the magnitudes of the film reflectivity and the ratio of the substrate to film thermal conductivities .",
    "as film becomes thinner , the stabilizing effect of the internal heat generation becomes smaller as more heat is generated in thicker films .",
    "impacts of the different modes of irradiation are investigated numerically in the 2d setting . for the spatially uniform ( single beam ) irradiation",
    "the film rupture is spatially periodic with the wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation .",
    "the latter wavelength is determined by values of all system parameters , including the laser parameters . in the two - beam interference heating mode",
    "the ruptures occur in the ( cold ) regions of destructive interference , while at the ( hot ) regions of constructive interference the initial surface perturbation is still developing . assuming the irradiation is stopped after the first ruptures , the solidification is expected to create a ridge ( nanowire ) array , where the spatial distribution of ridges volumes follows the spatial periodicity of the interference imprint .",
    "these conclusions do not depend , at large , on the presence of the thickness - dependent reflectivity .",
    "however , quite unexpectedly we found that reflective films with @xmath219 can be completely stabilized against dewetting and rupture , although films with @xmath155 either small or large are less stable than the corresponding non - reflective films ( due to smaller magnitudes of the heat source in the reflective films ) .",
    "the rupture time from the simulations is comparable to the estimated and the experimentally obtained values @xcite .",
    "the rupture time of the films having nonzero reflectivity is significantly shorter than the one of the non - reflective films .",
    "finally , we point out the difference of thermocapillary mechanisms with and without heat generation in the film due to laser beam irradiation of the film surface . in standard applications , when the substrate is heated up ( i.e. , the situation where the film surface is not irradiated and thus there is no heat production in the film ) the thermocapillary effect is governed by the @xmath223 term in the evolution equation , where @xmath159 .",
    "this term is responsible for the fluid flow from the high temperature region ( the one that is closer to the hot substrate , i.e. the trough of the surface undulation ) to the low temperature region , i.e. the crest of the surface undulation , resulting in instability and ultimate film break - up in the high @xmath184 region . in that case",
    "the temperature gradient across the film is negative , @xmath224 . on the other hand , when the film surface is irradiated and the heat is generated in the film , the temperature gradient @xmath225 ( see fig .",
    "[ temp ] ) , despite that still @xmath159 .",
    "the heat source term in the evolution equation counterbalances the standard term , reversing the direction of the fluid flow . in the multiwavelength nonlinear simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ twobeam ] this effect manifests as enhanced surface stability in the hot regions .",
    "the linear stability is also drastically affected ( see figs .",

    "these results could help understanding the dewetting and rupture process in ultrathin metal films irradiated by pulsed laser beams , such as co , fe , au , ni , cu , ag and mo films on glass and sio@xmath226/si substrates @xcite .",
