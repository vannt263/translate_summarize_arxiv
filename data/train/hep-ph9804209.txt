    "the meson - meson interaction has been the key problem to test chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath9 ) , which has proved rather successful at low energies @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is that an expansion in powers of the meson momenta converges at sufficiently low energy , which in practice is @xmath10 mev .",
    "however , the convergence at higher energies becomes progressively worse .",
    "even more , one of the peculiar features of the meson - meson interaction is the presence of resonances like the @xmath11 in the scalar sector and the @xmath12 or the @xmath13 in the vector channels",
    ". these resonances will show up in the @xmath14 matrix as poles that can not be obtained using standard @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry breaking are rather powerful and not restricted to the region where @xmath9 is meant to converge @xcite .",
    "two independent approaches of non perturbative character have extended the use of chiral lagrangians to higher energies and have been rather successful , reproducing important features of the meson - meson interaction including several resonances .",
    "although these two approaches look in principle rather different , they share a common feature which is the imposition of unitarity .",
    "one of them @xcite , based upon the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) , first suggested in @xcite , makes use of the lowest order , @xmath0 , as well as the next to leading order , @xmath1 , lagrangians .",
    "elastic unitarity is imposed and thus no mixture of channels is allowed .",
    "then , the coefficients of the @xmath1 lagrangian are fitted to the data .",
    "the absence of coupled channels has obvious limitations , but in spite of them , the iam is able to generate dynamically the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances , and to reproduce @xmath18 scattering in the ( i , j)=(0,0 ) , ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,0 ) partial waves , as well as in the ( 3/2,0),(1/2,1 ) and ( 1/2,0 ) channels of @xmath19 scattering .",
    "the results are very successful up to 1 gev in all these channels but the ( 0,0 ) , where it only yields good results up to 700 mev",
    ". the limitations of this single channel approach become evident , for instance , in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 resonances ( j=0 and i=0 and 1 , respectively ) which do not appear as poles in the t matrix .",
    "the method also has a pathological behavior close to the t matrix zeros @xcite .",
    "the second approach dealt with the j=0 sector alone @xcite .",
    "the input consists of the @xmath0 lagrangian , which is used as the source of a potential between mesons .",
    "this potential enters in a set of coupled channel lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equations ( actually closer to bethe - salpeter equations , since relativistic propagators are used ) which leads to the scattering matrix .",
    "the method imposes unitarity in coupled channels ; hence it yields inelasticities when inelastic channels open up .",
    "amazingly , the approach has only one free parameter , which is a cut - off that regularizes the loop integrals of the ls equation .",
    "such a method proves rather successful since phase shifts and inelasticities are reproduced accurately up to 1200 mev .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath22 resonances appear as poles of the @xmath14 matrix for i = 0 and 1 , respectively , and their widths and partial decay widths are very well reproduced .",
    "in addition , one finds a pole when i = 0 at @xmath23 mev with a width of around 400 mev , corresponding to the @xmath17 meson , which was also found with similar properties with the iam @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 is due to the introduction of the @xmath26 channel in addition to @xmath27 in i = 0 and @xmath28 in i = 1 .",
    "these resonances disappear if the @xmath26 channel ( not considered in @xcite ) is omitted , while the @xmath17 in i = 0 is almost not affected .",
    "this explains why the @xmath24 and @xmath25 resonances did not show up in the iam @xcite .",
    "the success of the scheme of ref.@xcite in the scalar sector gives hopes that it could be used in other channels .",
    "however , one soon realizes that it does not reproduce properly the j = 1 sector .",
    "this looks less surprising when one recalls that the @xmath1 chiral lagrangian can be reproduced with the resonance saturation hypothesis @xcite . that is , assuming that the actual values of the @xmath1 parameters are basically saturated by resonance exchanges between goldstone bosons .",
    "in this way , one establishes a clear relation between the information contained in the @xmath1 lagrangian and the resonances in the meson - meson sector , particularly vector meson resonances , where the approach of @xcite has its stronghold .",
    "indeed , the absence of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the approach of @xcite , which only uses the @xmath0 lagrangian , is an indirect confirmation of the link between these resonances and the @xmath1 lagrangian .",
    "the approaches of @xcite and @xcite seem complementary and one may wonder whether there is a generalization of these methods , containing both them as limiting cases .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question was recently found and such a generalized method was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to exploit the idea of @xcite and obtain all the predictions of such approach in the meson - meson sector , like phase shifts , inelasticities , resonance properties , etc ... at the same time we will establish the links between this scheme and @xmath9 at low energies .",
    "we also illustrate qualitatively , using a toy model , why the proposed method is so successful when dealing with amplitudes dominated by resonances .",
    "let us write the partial wave decomposition of the meson - meson amplitude with definite isospin @xmath29 as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the partial wave amplitude with isospin @xmath29 and angular momentum @xmath32 . in each one of these channels",
    "there are several meson - meson states coupled to each other . in table",
    "i , we have listed these states for the @xmath33 channels , which contain the most relevant meson - meson information below 1 gev . note that it is enough to take into account one or two states in each channel since we are neglecting here , on the one hand , multipion states which are only relevant for higher energies and , on the other hand , the @xmath34 that appears for @xmath35 .",
    "the influence of this state is rather small .",
    "we have checked it following the scheme of @xcite and , although not zero , we found it small enough to omit it with the consequent simplicity in the general formalism .    hence , throughout the present work , @xmath36 will be either a @xmath37 symmetric matrix when two states couple , or just a number when there is only one state . in what follows",
    "we omit the @xmath29 , @xmath32 labels and use a matrix formalism , which will be valid for the general case of @xmath38 matrices corresponding to @xmath39 coupled states .",
    "the normalization of @xmath14 is such that @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , respectively , the cm three momenta of the initial and final state and @xmath43 is the usual mandelstam variable .",
    "note that we have chosen a convention for the sign of @xmath14 such that in an elastic amplitude @xmath44 .",
    "unitarity in coupled channels implies    @xmath45    where @xmath17 is a real diagonal matrix whose elements account for the phase space of the two meson intermediate states @xmath39 which are physically accessible . with the normalization that we have chosen ,",
    "@xmath17 is given by the imaginary part of the loop integral of two meson propagators in the @xmath39 state    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the on - shell cm momentum of the meson in the intermediate state @xmath39 , p is the initial total four - momentum and @xmath50 the masses of the two mesons in the state @xmath39 .",
    "an analytical expression for @xmath51 using a cut - off ( @xmath52 ) regularization in the integral over @xmath53 is shown in appendix a.    from eq.([tunit ] ) we can extract @xmath17 and express it , in matrix form , as    @xmath54    hence ,    @xmath55^{- 1 } \\label{tinverse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is a practical way to write the unitarity requirements of eq.([tunit ] ) which tells us that we only need to know @xmath56 since @xmath57 is given by the phase space of the intermediate physical states .",
    "the next point is to realize that the @xmath14 matrix has poles associated to resonances , which implies that the standard perturbative evaluation of @xmath9 will necessarily fail close to these poles . as a consequence",
    ", one might try to exploit the expansion of @xmath58 , which will have zeros at the poles of t , and in principle does not present convergence problems . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we can use an analogy with the function @xmath59 when expanded around @xmath60 ( @xmath61 playing here the role of @xmath62 in the chiral expansion ) .",
    "this function has a pole at @xmath63 .",
    "its inverse , @xmath64 , has a laurent expansion around @xmath60 and a zero at @xmath63 .",
    "however , inverting the expansion of @xmath65 around @xmath66 for values of @xmath61 near @xmath67 , provides a faster convergence than expanding directly @xmath59 around that point . with this idea in mind",
    "let us expand @xmath68 in powers of @xmath62 as one would do for @xmath14 using @xmath9 :    @xmath69    @xmath70^{- 1 }   \\simeq t_2^{- 1}\\cdot [ 1 - t_4 \\cdot t_2^{- 1 } ... ] \\label{tichpt}\\ ] ]    this expression requires the inversion @xmath71 which might not be invertible , as it happens , for instance in the ( 1 , 1 ) channel .",
    "in order to avoid the use of @xmath72 we modify eq.([tinverse ] ) by formally multiplying by @xmath73 on the right and @xmath74 on the left .",
    "all the steps are justified using the continuity of the functions involved in the derivation , starting from a matrix close to @xmath71 , which can be inverted .",
    "thus , eq.([tinverse ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath75^{- 1 }   \\cdot t_2 \\label{pret}\\ ] ]    now , using the expansion for @xmath68 of eq.([tichpt ] ) we find    @xmath76    and recalling that    @xmath77    we finally obtain , within the @xmath1 approximation    @xmath78^{- 1 } \\cdot t_2 \\label{geniam}\\ ] ]    note , as it is clear from eq.([pret ] ) , that what we are expanding is actually @xmath79 , which in our analogy would be equivalent to @xmath80 , which is also convergent around @xmath66 .    in another context , the above equation can also be derived using pad approximants @xcite .",
    "this equation is a generalization to multiple coupled channels of the iam of ref.@xcite .",
    "it makes the method more general and powerful and also allows to evaluate transition cross sections as well as inelasticities .",
    "the coupled channel result has additional virtues with respect to the single channel iam .",
    "indeed , in this latter case the expansion of eq.([tichpt ] ) is meaningless if @xmath81 or @xmath82 @xcite . in particular",
    ", if @xmath71 vanishes , eq.([geniam ] ) yields @xmath83 , which has a _",
    "double _ zero , whereas the correct result would be @xmath84 .",
    "this indeed occurs in the @xmath85 partial waves below threshold ( adler zeros ) .",
    "however , within the coupled channel formalism , if a matrix element , say @xmath86 , vanishes , it is sufficient that @xmath87 , since then eq.([geniam ] ) gives @xmath88 , which is the correct result . in conclusion , while the single channel iam gives a _",
    "zero whenever @xmath82 , the coupled channel method leads to _ single _ zeros close to the zeros of @xmath71 .",
    "the single channel iam has another related problem , since close to the adler zero it presents an spurious pole when @xmath89 .",
    "the coupled channel method also avoids this problem , although it runs into a similar one when the determinant of the @xmath90 matrix vanishes below threshold .",
    "this happens indeed for @xmath85 , @xmath91 around @xmath92 mev .",
    "excluding the neighborhood of this zero of the determinant , we can still recover from eq.([geniam ] ) the usual @xmath9 expansion , @xmath93 valid for low energies , typically @xmath94 mev . in any case",
    "we concentrate here on results above the two pion threshold .",
    "it is now important to realize that eq.([geniam ] ) requires the complete evaluation of @xmath95 , which is rather involved when dealing with many channels , as it is the case here .",
    "instead , we present a further approximation to eq.([geniam ] ) which turns out to be technically much simpler and rather accurate . in order to illustrate the steps leading to our final formula ,",
    "let us make before another approximation .",
    "let us assume that through a suitable cut - off we can approximate    @xmath96    in such a case we go back to eqs.([pret ] , [ tret ] ) and immediately write    @xmath97^{- 1 } \\cdot t_2\\ ] ]    that is equivalent to    @xmath98    which is a ls equation for the @xmath14 matrix , where @xmath71 plays the role of the potential .",
    "this is actually the approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is a subtle difference between eq.([ls ] ) and the ordinary ls integral equation . indeed , eq.([ls ] ) is an algebraic equation since @xmath71 and @xmath14 are factorized out of the integrals with their on - shell value . in contrast , in the ordinary ls equations , the @xmath99 term is actually the integral of eq.([g ] ) , including @xmath71 and @xmath100 _ inside _ the integral , since both of them depend on @xmath101 . due to the structure of the @xmath0 lagrangian , it was shown in @xcite that writing @xmath102 as @xmath103 + @xmath104 , the off - shell part renormalizes couplings and masses and hence it had to be omitted .",
    "therefore @xmath71 , and @xmath14 factorized _ outside _ the integral with their on - shell values . as a consequence , the very same algebraic equation ( [ ls ] )",
    "was obtained .",
    "as we have already commented , the approximation of eq.([ret4 ] ) leads to excellent results in the scalar channels .",
    "however , as we mentioned in the introduction , the generalization to @xmath105 is not possible since basic information contained in the @xmath1 chiral lagrangian is missing in eq.([ret4 ] ) .",
    "the obvious solution is to add a term to eq.([ret4 ] ) such that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the polynomial tree level contribution coming from the @xmath1 lagrangian , whose terms contain several free parameters , usually denoted @xmath108 . within our approach",
    ", these coefficients will be fitted to data and denoted by @xmath109 since they do not have to coincide with those used in @xmath9 , as we shall see . actually , the @xmath108 coefficients depend on a regularization scale ( @xmath110 ) . in our scheme",
    "this scale dependence appears through the cut - off .",
    "in addition , there are also differences between our renormalization scheme and that of standard @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , our approach considers the iteration of loop diagrams in the s - channel , but neglects loops in the u or t channels .",
    "however , the smooth structure of these terms for the physical s - channel , since we are far away from the associated singularities , allows them to be approximately reabsorbed when fitting the @xmath109 coefficients . concerning tadpoles ,",
    "they would be exactly reabsorbed in the @xmath109 in the equal mass case . therefore , when masses are different , we are omitting terms proportional to differences between the actual masses squared and an average mass squared .",
    "thus all these contributions will make the @xmath111 differ from the @xmath108 , although we expect them to be of the same order .",
    "this way of dealing with tadpoles has an additional advantage .",
    "apart from the usual tadpole diagrams that would also appear in standard @xmath9 there are some additional tadpole terms .",
    "they come from the determinant of the @xmath112 metric that should be included in the path integral measure in order to make the generating functional @xmath112 covariant @xcite . with dimensional",
    "regularization such contributions vanish , but that is not the case when using a cutoff regularization @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have just described how tadpoles are absorbed within our approximation and thus we do not have to calculate them .    with these approximations",
    "our calculations have been considerably simplified at the expense of losing some precision at low energies with respect to the full @xmath1 @xmath9 calculation . as far",
    "as we are mostly interested in resonance behavior as well as higher energies this is not very relevant . nevertheless ,",
    "if the complete @xmath1 calculations were available , we could directly use eq.([geniam ] ) , and have both an accurate low energy description and a good coupled channel unitarity behavior .    using eqs.([pret ] ) and ( [ tret ] ) , our final formula for the @xmath14 matrix is given by    @xmath113^{- 1 } \\cdot t_2 \\label{ourt}\\ ] ]",
    "in order to illustrate how the method works , we take a simple case of one channel and one amplitude around a resonance which we assume to know exactly . that is ,    @xmath114    where @xmath62 is an invariant quantity , of dimension momentum squared , related to the momenta or masses of the pseudoscalar mesons , q the total four - momentum of the meson pair and @xmath115 .",
    "the above equation satisfies unitarity exactly as can be seen by using eq.([img ] ) .    to @xmath116 , @xmath117",
    ", we have    @xmath118    whereas at @xmath119 we have    @xmath120    then , using eq.([geniam ] ) we find    @xmath121    so , as we can see , in this particular case the iam leads to the exact result for the @xmath14 matrix , eq.([toy ] ) .",
    "the result is exact here because @xmath122 is an @xmath119 function and hence the expansion up to @xmath119 in eq.([tret ] ) is exact .",
    "however , the structure of eq.([toy ] ) is that of a meson propagator of an unstable particle like the @xmath123 , etc ... resonances",
    ". this could justify why the scheme which we propose works even better that one could naively anticipate , at least for resonant channels .",
    "the above argumentation uses the same power counting in momenta as @xmath9 , but presumes that the @xmath116 amplitude comes from the exchange of a resonance .",
    "this seems to be in conflict with @xcite , where it is shown that resonance exchange contribution shows up at higher orders .",
    "however , when taking into account requirements of short distance behavior of qcd , these two points can be reconciled .",
    "in fact , this has been shown , in @xcite , where a classical vector meson dominance expression for the pion form factor is obtained , in the same lines as eq.([toy ] ) , starting from chiral lagrangians and imposing those qcd constraints at short distances and the large @xmath124 limit .    in relation to the previous arguments",
    ", the link between unitarized @xmath9 and vector meson dominance has also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the lowest order chiral lagrangian is given by    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the pion decay coupling and @xmath127 stands for the trace of the @xmath128 matrices build out of @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "finally , the @xmath199 phase shifts are small as shown in fig.(5.c ) and the inelasticities given in fig.(5.d ) are not distant from unity .",
    "this fact indicates a small mixture of @xmath200 with @xmath201 .",
    "in this case we also find a resonance in fig.(6.a ) , analogous to the @xmath15 , but in the @xmath200 system .",
    "this resonant state , known as the @xmath202 , is as clean as the @xmath15 , and the agreement of our results with the data is remarkably good over the whole range of energies up to 1.2 gev . in fig.(6.c )",
    "we plot the @xmath203 phase shifts , which are very small . finally , in fig.(6.d ) we can notice that @xmath204 which means that there is practically no mixture of @xmath200 and @xmath201 in this channel .",
    "this justifies the success of @xcite reproducing this resonance using only the @xmath200 state and elastic unitarity .      in fig.(7 )",
    "we show the @xmath193 phase shifts .",
    "as we can see in the figure , the agreement with the data is quite good up to about @xmath205 gev .",
    ".5 cm    the channel ( 3/2,1 ) in @xmath193 ( see table i ) is such that @xmath82 , since there is only s - wave there . in this case",
    "our method can not be applied , as discussed above , and we should just take the @xmath95 contribution .",
    "that also happens for the @xmath206 channels , since the structure of @xmath71 , which is @xmath0 , is a linear combination of @xmath43 , @xmath190 , @xmath207 and squared masses .",
    "therefore there is only @xmath208 in @xmath71 , but not @xmath206 .",
    "hence , the lowest contribution can only be obtained from the @xmath95 terms and our method has nothing to improve there with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the phase shifts in these channels are small and have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "hence we omit any further discussion , simply mentioning that the agreement with data found in @xcite is fairly good .",
    "there is another interesting result in the ( 0,1 ) , channel which is the appearance of a pole around 990 mev , that we show in fig.(8 ) .",
    "below 1.2 gev there are two resonances with such quantum numbers .",
    "they are the @xmath209 and the @xmath210 , which fit well within the @xmath211 scheme , with practically ideal mixing , as @xmath212 and @xmath213 , respectively .",
    "hence , the @xmath209 would almost decouple from @xmath180 and then we should not expect it to appear in our scheme with only the @xmath26 channel .",
    "the three pion channel , into which the @xmath209 mostly decays , is not considered in our approach , restricted to two meson states .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath210 couples strongly to the @xmath26 system .",
    "it seems then natural to identify the above mentioned pole with the @xmath210 .",
    "indeed , it is only 30 mev below its real mass , 1020 mev ( which means a relative deviation of only 3 @xmath214 ) . due to this shift towards lower energy",
    "this resonance appears below the @xmath180 threshold and this is why we find no width at all .",
    "nevertheless , as far as its physical width is only @xmath215 mev , it seems plausible that that the small coupling to three pions ( an ozi suppressed coupling of third class ) which we are not taking into account , could be enough to improve the agreement between the position of our @xmath210 resonance and its real mass and width .",
    "we will now look for the poles of the @xmath14 matrix in the complex plane , that should appear in the unphysical riemann sheets ( the conventions taken are those of @xcite , which can be easily induced from the analytical expressions of appendix a ) .",
    "let us remember that the mass and the width of a breit - wigner resonance are related to the position of its complex pole by @xmath216 , but this formula does not hold for other kind of resonances .",
    "in table ii we give the results for the pole positions as well as the apparent or `` effective '' masses and widths that can be estimated from phase shifts and mass distributions in scattering processes .",
    "note that such `` effective '' masses and widths depend on the physical process .",
    "we shall make differentiation between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are clean elastic breit - wigner resonances , and the rest .",
    "for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 their mass is given by the energy at which @xmath217 and the width is taken from the phase shifts slope around @xmath217 , by means of    @xmath218    we also saw that , in practice , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 only couple to @xmath18 and @xmath193 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17 decays only to @xmath18 and the @xmath3 only to @xmath193 due to phase space and dynamical suppression of other channels ( see fig.(5d ) ) .",
    "the case of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 is different , since they can decay either to @xmath18 or @xmath26 ( the @xmath24 ) , and @xmath183 or @xmath180 ( the @xmath25 ) . in order to determine the partial decay widths of these resonances we follow the procedure of @xcite , where we show that , assuming a breit wigner shape for the amplitudes around the resonance pole , the partial decay widths are given by    @xmath219    where @xmath220 stands for the total cm energy of the meson - meson system , @xmath101 is the momentum of one meson in the cm and the labels @xmath221 stand for @xmath180 , @xmath18 in the case of the @xmath24 and @xmath26 , @xmath183 in the case of the @xmath25 .",
    "the masses of the final mesons are @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",
    "the upper limit in the integral , @xmath224 , is @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the total width @xcite and @xmath227 , unless the threshold energy ( @xmath228 ) for the decay is bigger than that quantity , in which case @xmath229 . in this way",
    "we largely avoid the contribution of the backgrounds in the amplitudes .",
    "one caveat must be raised concerning eq.([oset ] ) , which was already pointed out in the study of the @xmath230 decay @xcite .",
    "the subtlety is that around this resonance the phase shifts ( see fig.(1.a ) ) are of the order of @xmath231 , due to the background coming from the broad @xmath17 pole .",
    "this background makes the @xmath232 coupling constant to appear effectively multiplied by a @xmath67 phase ( @xmath233 factor ) and in this way the @xmath234 amplitude around the @xmath24 looks like an ordinary breit wigner multiplied by @xmath233 .",
    "this means that the real part has a peak around the resonance and the imaginary part changes sign . in this case",
    "the arguments used in @xcite and @xcite lead to a trivial modification in @xmath235 , where @xmath236 should be substituted by @xmath237 .",
    "it is also very instructing to see the representation of the poles in a three dimensional plot . in fig.(9 ) we are showing on the left the imaginary part of the ( 0,0 ) @xmath171 scattering amplitude on the second riemann sheet .",
    "it is possible to see very clearly the appearance of two poles that correspond to the @xmath17 and the @xmath24 resonances .",
    "the former is located at @xmath238 and thus is very far away from the real axis , which implies a huge effective width .",
    "in contrast , the other pole is located at @xmath239 mev accordingly to the narrow width of the @xmath24 resonance .",
    "apart from the position of the poles , there is an additional piece of information which also determines the observed shape of a resonance .",
    "it also explains some of the differences between the `` effective '' masses and the real part of the pole position . on the right of fig.(9 )",
    "we give a contour plot , again of the imaginary part of the ( 0,0 ) amplitude in the second riemann sheet . notice that both poles are oriented differently , almost transversally , on the complex plane . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath24 pole is oriented almost perpendicularly to the real axis , which is the relevant one in this work .",
    "as a consequence , in the positive real axis , the imaginary part of the amplitude first grows rapidly and then drops very fast again , giving rise to the dramatic variation of the phase shift typical of resonances .",
    "a similar orientation is found for the @xmath240 and @xmath241 resonances too . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath17 pole is oriented so that in the real axis we only see a slow and smooth increase , but almost no decrease , of the imaginary part .",
    "that is also the case of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "this feature , together with the fact that both the @xmath17 and the @xmath3 are very far from the real axis explains why it is so hard to establish firmly their existence and their physical parameters .",
    "finally , in fig.(10 ) we present a very detailed contour plot of the @xmath15 and @xmath25 poles .",
    "both of them are almost perpendicular to the real axis , but the former is tilted clockwise , whereas the latter is tilted anti - clockwise .",
    "let us now remember that the real part of the pole position , roughly , should give us the apparent mass of the resonance .",
    "however , the lines of maximum gradient of each pole cross the real axis at a point which is slightly different from the real part of its position . therefore , those poles rotated clockwise , as the @xmath15 or the @xmath16 , have an apparent mass a little bit higher than that given by the pole position .",
    "in contrast those tilted anti - clockwise , yield a resonance whose mass is somewhat lower that the one obtained from the pole .",
    "that is the case of the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 .",
    "we have used a coupled channel unitary approach , together with the dynamical information contained in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 chiral lagrangian , which allows us to study the meson - meson interaction up to about 1.2 gev .",
    "this non - perturbative method generates poles in the complex plane corresponding to physical resonances .",
    "we have used the experimental information available to make a fit of the @xmath1 lagrangian coefficients . these are @xmath111 , @xmath165 and @xmath242 , whose actual values depend on the cut - off that we have used to regularize divergent one loop integrals . with those seven degrees of freedom",
    "we are able to fit , up to 1.2 gev , all the experimental information in seven meson - meson channels .",
    "each one of this channels consists of two phase shifts and an inelasticity .",
    "moreover , in our results , we obtain the position and widths , partial decay widths , etc .... of all the resonances that appear in those channels below 1.2 gev .",
    "apart from the standard @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 resonances , we find poles in the @xmath14 matrix for the @xmath17 in the @xmath18 @xmath243 channel and for @xmath3 in the ( 1/2,0 ) channel , both them very broad .",
    "the method has proved very efficient to extend the ideas of chiral symmetry at energies beyond the realm of applicability of @xmath9 . however , at energies higher than 1.2 gev , the limitations of the model show up , since , among other things , we have restricted ourselves only to two meson states .",
    "the restrictions in the space of states precluded the appearance of the @xmath209 resonance which couples dominantly to three pions .",
    "however , the @xmath210 resonance which couples strongly to @xmath180 does appear in the scheme , although slightly shifted towards lower energies . presumably , by including the @xmath210 coupling to three pions , although very small , it should be enough to shift the mass to its correct place .",
    "one of the formal weakness of the approach is that loops in crossed channels , as well as some tadpole contributions , are not explicitly included in the calculation . in practice",
    ", their effect can be reabsorbed in the fit of the @xmath1 parameters , whose values can then be different from those obtained for the standard low energy @xmath9 approach .",
    "this approximation could be improved by using eq.([geniam ] ) with the full @xmath1 @xmath9 calculation , which includes one loop in crossed channels and the tadpoles .",
    "this would allow a more straightforward comparison with standard @xmath9 as well as a better accuracy in the low energy results .",
    "although such calculations are welcome and there is indeed some work in progress @xcite , they are far more involved to calculate and use .    applications of the method to other physical problems are also in order .",
    "indeed , it can be easily extended to deal with processes where meson pairs appear in the initial or final state , like meson pair photoproduction @xcite .",
    "it looks likely that it could also prove useful describing the meson - nucleon interaction @xcite complemented with heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "in addition , the method , non perturbative in nature , is equally well suited to study the meson - meson interaction in a nuclear medium where there has been some speculation about the appearance of bound @xmath18 pairs @xcite .",
    "finally it seems that the approach could be extended to the effective chiral lagrangian description of the standard model strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector , where the single channel approach has already been applied @xcite .",
