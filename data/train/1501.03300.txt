    "in recent years a great interest has been devoted to investigate the statistical properties of the motion of active ( or self - propelled ) particles .",
    "these particles differ from passive particles since they move under the action of an internal force .",
    "typical examples of these particles are brownian motors @xcite , biological and artificial microswimmers @xcite , macroscopic animals @xcite and even pedestrians @xcite .    in the last decade , this investigation has also been addressed in the framework of mobile robotics , in particular by analyzing the @xmath0 cases of the unicyle , cart , and car @xcite , and the @xmath1 case of flexible needle steering @xcite . in these works ,",
    "analytical solutions are obtained by directly solving the corresponding fokker - planck equations by using the fourier transform .",
    "another method proposed for obtaining a closed - form solution is the use of exponential coordinates @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "the benefit of having closed - form solutions is clearly illustrated by introducing motion planning methods based on them .    in this paper",
    "we want to deal with wheeled robots , which represent a special case of active particles moving in a two dimensional space .",
    "their configuration is characterized by a 3d - vector ( 2 components characterize their position and one their orientation ) . on the other hand , in most of cases , a wheeled robot can not move along any direction since it must satisfy the so - called non - holonomic constraints @xcite .",
    "our stochastic motion model ( presented in section [ sectionstochasticmotionmodel ] ) differs from the one considered in @xcite since we assume independent errors acting on the linear and angular components .",
    "the model adopted in @xcite refers to the case of a differential drive system where the errors acting on each wheel are independent .",
    "starting from our stochastic motion model , we compute the analytical expression of any - order moment of the probability distribution ( section [ sectioncomputationpdf ] ) .",
    "specifically , each moment is expressed as a multiple integral of the deterministic motion performed by the mobile robot ( i.e. , the known motion that would result in absence of noise ) . in other words ,",
    "the expression is a multiple integral on two time - dependent functions , which describe the time behaviour of the deterministic linear and angular speed .",
    "this allows obtaining any order moment for any deterministic motion , i.e. , when the mobile robot is propelled by arbitrary time - dependent linear and angular speed . for the special case when the ratio between these two speeds is constant ,",
    "the multiple integrals can be expressed as the real or the imaginary part of suitable analytic functions . in section [ sectiondiffusivity ]",
    "we show the power of the derived analytical results by investigating the diffusivity of the considered brownian motion for constant and for arbitrary time - dependent linear and angular speed .",
    "conclusions are provided in section [ sectionconclusion ] .",
    "the interest in deriving the statistical properties of the motion of a wheeled robot comes from the possibility of improving its localization ( both in precision and speed ) .",
    "the localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics which must be solved to autonomously and safely navigate .",
    "it is a non linear estimation problem . in most of cases ,",
    "the localization is carried out by using nonlinear filters ( e.g. , extended and unscented kalman filters , particle filters , etc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "non linear filters are strictly connected with the solution of partial differential equations ( see @xcite and the next section [ sectionstochasticmotionmodel ] ) .",
    "very easily speaking , for a dynamic stochastic process described by stochastic differential equations , it is possible to introduce a probability distribution which provides the probability that the process takes a given set of values .",
    "this probability distribution must satisfy a partial differential equation . in this sense",
    ", a non linear filter could be considered as a numerical solution of this partial differential equation . in the specific case of localization",
    ", the dynamic process is the motion of the robot together with the noisy data delivered by its sensors .",
    "we already computed the statistics up to the second order for a similar motion model @xcite ( in the expressions in @xcite there are some typos , corrected in @xcite ) . here , we extend the computation in @xcite by including any - order statistics . we also show that the expressions hold for a much more general model ( the one described in section [ sectionstochasticmotionmodel ] ) and not only for a simple specific odometry error model ( as shown in @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", this paper provides a complete analytical solution to a fokker - planck equation for which the detailed balance condition is not verified .",
    "note that the goal of this paper is to analytically compute the moments of the probability distribution up to any order for the configuration of a non - holonomic vehicle .",
    "as it will be seen , this is a very hard task from a computational point of view",
    ". these analytical results could be very useful to improve the localization which is , as previously mentioned , a numerical solution of a partial differential equation .",
    "we consider a mobile robot which moves in a @xmath2environment .",
    "the configuration of the mobile robot is characterized by its position and orientation . in cartesian",
    "coordinates , we denote them by @xmath3^t$ ] and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the motion of the mobile robot satisfies the _ unicycle _ model @xcite , which is the most general nonholonomic model for @xmath2motions , where the shift of the mobile robot can only occur along one direction ( @xmath5^t$ ] ) :    @xmath6    the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the linear and angular speed , respectively .",
    "we assume that these functions are known and we call the motion that results from them the _ deterministic _ motion .",
    "now we want to introduce a stochastic model that generalizes equation ( [ equationunicycle ] ) by accounting a gaussian white noise .",
    "we assume that also the noise satisfies the same nonholonomic constraint .",
    "the stochastic differential equations are :    @xmath9\\\\ dy(t)=&\\sin\\theta(t)~[v(t ) dt + \\alpha(t ) dw^r(t)]\\\\ d\\theta(t)=&\\omega(t ) dt + \\beta(t ) dw^{\\theta}(t ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath10^t$ ] is a standard wiener process of dimension two @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are modeled according to the following physical requirement ( diffusion in the overdamped regime ) .",
    "we require that , when the mobile robot moves during the infinitesimal time interval @xmath13 , the shift is a random gaussian variable , whose variance increases linearly with the traveled distance .",
    "this is obtained by setting @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a positive parameter which characterizes our system ( interaction robot - environment ) .",
    "similarly , we require that the rotation accomplished during the same time interval @xmath13 is a random gaussian variable , whose variance increases linearly with the traveled distance . hence , we set @xmath16 , with @xmath17 another positive parameter which characterizes our system ( interaction robot - environment ) .",

    "our goal is to obtain the probability density @xmath29 .",
    "this will be done in the next two sections .",
    "the probability density @xmath30 satisfies the smoluchowski partial differential equation in ( [ equationsmoluchowski ] ) , which is a special case of the fokker - planck equation . since the detailed balance condition is not satisfied @xcite , we follow a different procedure to compute @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , we use the langevin equation in ( [ equationunicyclestochastics ] ) to compute the moments , up to any order , of the probability distribution .",
    "first of all , we remark that the third equation in ( [ equationunicyclestochastics ] ) is independent of the first two , is independent of @xmath4 and is linear in @xmath31 . as a result ,",

    "note that , according to the unicycle model , a trajectory is completely characterized by its starting point and by the orientation vs the curve length , i.e. , by the function @xmath42 . in the following , we will call the deterministic function @xmath43 , the _ deterministic _ trajectory .",
