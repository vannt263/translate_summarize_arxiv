    "the standard model ( sm ) @xcite is a gauge theory , based on the group @xmath0 , which describes strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions , via the exchange of the corresponding spin-1 gauge fields : 8 massless gluons and 1 massless photon for the strong and electromagnetic forces , respectively , and 3 massive bosons , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for the weak interaction .",
    "the gauge symmetry determines the dynamics in terms of the three couplings @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , associated with the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 subgroups .",
    "strong interactions are governed by the first group factor , while the other two provide a unified description of the electroweak forces , their gauge parameters being related through @xmath9 .",

    "thus , the left - handed fields are @xmath7 doublets , while their right - handed partners transform as @xmath7 singlets .",
    "the three fermionic families in ( [ eq : families ] ) appear to have identical properties ( gauge interactions ) ; they only differ by their mass and their flavour quantum number .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken by the vacuum , which triggers the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the electroweak group to the electromagnetic subgroup : @xmath12 the ssb mechanism generates the masses of the weak gauge bosons , and gives rise to the appearance of a physical scalar particle , the so - called _",
    "the fermion masses and mixings are also generated through the ssb mechanism .",

    "the @xmath19 loop induces a logarithmic correction with @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the effective qed running coupling increases with the energy scale : @xmath21 if @xmath22 , i.e. , the electromagnetic charge decreases at large distances . this can be intuitively understood as the screening due to virtual @xmath19 pairs generated , through quantum effects , around the electron charge .",
    "the physical qed vacuum behaves as a polarized dielectric medium .",
    "the huge difference between the electron and @xmath2 mass scales makes this quantum correction relevant at lep energies @xcite : @xmath23 the strong interaction between two quarks can be analyzed in a similar way . owing to the non - abelian character of the @xmath6 group , qcd leads to cubic and quartic self - interactions among gluons .",
    "this results in a strong running coupling @xmath24 with the same @xmath25 dependence ( [ eq : alpha_run ] ) , but with a negative @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 the contribution proportional to the number of quark flavours @xmath28 is generated by the @xmath29-@xmath30 loop corrections to the gluon self - energy .",
    "the gluonic self - interactions introduce the additional negative term proportional to the number of quark colours @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath32 , @xmath24 decreases at short distances .",

    "an important example is provided by the mixing between the @xmath63 meson and its antiparticle : @xmath65 with @xmath66 a loop function of @xmath67 .",
    "owing to the unitarity of the ckm matrix , the mixing amplitude vanishes for equal ( up - type ) quark masses .",
    "thus the effect is proportional to the mass splittings between the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 quarks . since all ckm factors have a similar size , @xmath71 , the top contribution dominates completely .",

    "@xmath87 is determined by a single parameter , the so - called cabibbo angle  @xcite , while for @xmath90 the ckm matrix is described by 3 angles and 1 phase  @xcite .",
    "this is the only complex phase in the sm lagrangian ; thus , it is a unique source for violations of the cp symmetry .",
    "it was for this reason that the third generation was assumed to exist @xcite , before the discovery of the @xmath45 and the @xmath91 .      for many years ,",
    "the only experimental evidence of cp - violation phenomena came from the kaon system .",
    "the ratios , @xmath92 involve final @xmath93 states which are even under cp .",
    "therefore , they measure a cp - violating amplitude which can originate either from a small cp - even admixture in the initial @xmath94 state ( indirect cp violation ) , parameterized by @xmath95 , or from direct cp violation in the decay amplitude . this latter effect , parameterized by @xmath96 , requires the interference between the two @xmath97 isospin ( @xmath98 ) amplitudes , with different weak and strong phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath95 is well determined @xcite : @xmath99 @xmath95 has been also measured @xcite through the cp asymmetry between the two @xmath100 decay widths , which implies re@xmath101 , in good agreement with ( [ eq : eps_k ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath96 has been established very recently .",

    "this time , however , the charm loop contributions are non - negligible .",

    "the sm prediction for @xmath117 is found to be @xcite : @xmath118 in excellent agreement with the measured experimental value ( [ eq : eps ] ) .",
    "the unitarity tests in ( [ eq : unit ] ) and ( [ eq : w_had ] ) involve only the moduli of the ckm parameters , while cp violation has to do with their phases .",
    "the most interesting off - diagonal unitarity condition is @xmath119 which has three terms of a similar size .",
    "this relation can be visualized by a triangle in the complex plane , which is usually scaled by dividing its sides by @xmath120 .",
    "this aligns one side of the triangle along the real axis and makes its length equal to 1 ; the coordinates of the 3 vertices are then @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath110 . in the absence of cp violation ( @xmath123 ) , this unitarity triangle would degenerate into a segment along the real axis .",
    "the length of the sides and the angles ( @xmath41 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) of the unitarity triangle can be directly measured .",
    "in fact , we have already determined its sides from @xmath126 and @xmath127-@xmath128 mixing , and the position of the @xmath110 vertex has been further pinned down in fig .  [",

    "it is able to explain any single experimental fact and , in some cases , it has successfully passed very precise tests at the 0.1% to 1% level @xcite . in spite of this impressive phenomenological success ,",
    "the sm leaves too many unanswered questions to be considered as a complete description of the fundamental forces .",
    "we do not understand yet why fermions are replicated in three ( and only three ) nearly identical copies ? why the pattern of masses and mixings is what it is ? are the masses the only difference among the three families ?",
    "what is the origin of the sm flavour structure ?",
    "which dynamics is responsible for the observed cp violation ?    the fermionic flavour is the main source of arbitrary free parameters in the sm .",
    "the problem of fermion - mass generation is deeply related with the mechanism responsible for the electroweak ssb .",
    "thus , the origin of these parameters lies in the most obscure part of the sm lagrangian : the scalar sector .",
    "clearly , the dynamics of flavour appears to be `` terra incognita '' which deserves a careful investigation .",
    "the sm incorporates a mechanism to generate cp violation , through the single phase naturally occurring in the ckm matrix .",
