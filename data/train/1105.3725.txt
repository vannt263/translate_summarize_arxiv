    "the standard model ( sm ) successfully explains the observed suppression of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp violation effects . however , it says nothing about the origin of the hierarchies in the fermion masses and the ckm mixing angles .",
    "several theoretical ideas have been proposed to explain the peculiar pattern of fermion masses and mixings , such as horizontal symmetries  @xcite , fermion localization in extra dimensional models of randall  sundrum ( rs ) type  @xcite or wave function renormalization ( wfr )  @xcite by new strong interactions  @xcite . in most of these models ,",
    "the flavor hierarchies among sm fermion masses and mixings are generated directly or indirectly through their dynamical mixing with new heavy ( vectorlike ) fermions .",
    "sm yukawa couplings then arise from mixing angles that are given as ratios of mass parameters . apart from the heavy fermionic sector ,",
    "typically also new bosonic degrees of freedom are introduced that give rise to new flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp violating effects at low energy ( e.g. flavons , kk gluons or sfermions ) .",
    "very good agreement of such processes with the sm predictions leave little room for new contributions and thus requires the additional dynamics to be sufficiently heavy . while the minimal fermionic sector consists of a certain number of fermions with the same sm quantum numbers as the light fermions , the bosonic sector is very model dependent and so are the predictions for the new contributions to flavor violating effects at low energy .",
    "we therefore find it useful to construct a `` minimal '' theory of fermion masses that is capable to explain the hierarchy of sm yukawa couplings through mass hierarchies .",
    "for this purpose we extend the sm only by a heavy fermionic sector that mixes with chiral fermions , such that small yukawa couplings arise from small mixing angles .",
    "this mechanism is generic for many complete flavor models such as froggatt  nielsen ( fn ) or rs models , and therefore our construction can serve as an effective description of the fermionic sector of a large number of these kind of models . besides this aspect",
    "one can regard the model in a bottom - up approach as a minimal extension of the sm that contains only the essential pieces necessary to parameterize small couplings by small mass ratios .",
    "even though complete flavor models typically depart from the minimal structure , we think that this setup can serve as a useful reference frame for a further understanding of the origin of flavor hierarchies in the sm .",
    "already this minimal framework gives in general rise to fcnc and cp violating processes beyond the sm predictions .",
    "since the light sm fermions have admixture of heavy fermions which have explicit mass terms , it is clear that 1 ) su(2 ) doublets mix with su(2 ) singlets and 2 ) sm fermion masses are not aligned with higgs boson couplings .",
    "this implies that the couplings of the light fermions both to the massive sm gauge bosons and the higgs boson will receive corrections that in general are flavor non - diagonal , but suppressed by the ratio of electroweak scale and the heavy fermion mass .",
    "therefore all massive sm bosons mediate new flavor changing processes at the tree - level . since these effects are due to the same mixing that gives rise to sm fermion masses , they depend on the same ( small ) parameters that determine the sm yukawa couplings .    in order to construct a `` minimal '' model that merely contains the essential structure needed to parameterize yukawa couplings in terms of mass hierarchies , we start by adding an unspecified number of vectorlike fermions to the sm and require that all dimension four operators that can be constructed are either absent or have couplings that are @xmath9 .",
    "this setup is general enough to effectively describe the fermionic sector of almost every possible flavor model . on the other hand , there are clearly too many unknown parameters which prevent the extraction of any useful information .",
    "we therefore try to reduce the number of parameters such that the resulting model can still reproduce sm yukawas and in addition maximally suppresses flavor violating effects . in this way we can identify the minimal fcnc effects and allow the heavy fermions to be as light as possible . in a last step we restrict to the minimal number of heavy fermions needed to explain all sm masses . in this procedure",
    "we partially give up the original generality , but the resulting model provides a simple framework which allows to study the minimal phenomenological effects .",
    "it is then straightforward to include additional structures of complete flavor models .        according to this procedure , which we outline here restricting to the up - sector and one family for simplicity , we start by adding vectorlike fermions @xmath10 to the chiral field content of the sm @xmath11 and write the most general lagrangian , that reads up to canonical kinetic terms @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are @xmath9 or vanishing and we take @xmath15 such that @xmath16 are predominantly light fermions .",
    "we do not include yukawa couplings @xmath17 since clearly we can not get realistic masses for @xmath18 . instead sm masses arise after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) only through the mixing of light @xmath19 with heavy fermions @xmath20 and are suppressed by small mixing angles @xmath21 . in order to see this explicitly ,",

    "we are left with effective yukawa couplings @xmath27 and it is well known that one can fit fermion masses and mixings with this structure .",
    "let us now discuss how s fcncs arise in the effective theory .",
    "since in the fundamental theory we mix su(2 ) singlets with su(2 ) doublets , it is clear that the couplings of light fields to the @xmath0 boson receive corrections that in general are not flavor - diagonal .",
    "moreover , light masses arise partially from explicit mass terms and therefore there is no reason why higgs boson couplings should be aligned to the light masses .",
    "therefore we expect deviations from the sm both in @xmath0 and higgs boson couplings , but since these effects are due to su(2 ) breaking and must vanish when we decouple the heavy fermions , they are suppressed at least by @xmath28 . in the effective theory , these effects originate from the kinetic terms of the heavy fermions . inserting the solutions of the eoms into the heavy kinetic terms",
    "we get a contribution to the effective lagrangian @xmath29 where we have taken couplings and masses real for simplicity .",
    "the terms in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ effkin ] ) give just an overall rescaling factor for light fermions that will lead to higher order terms in @xmath21 in lagrangian .",
    "the terms in the second line instead generate ( in general flavor non - diagonal ) corrections to the couplings of @xmath30 and @xmath31 to the @xmath0 and higgs boson ( and @xmath32 ) which are of the form @xmath33 @xmath34 as well as corrections to light fermion masses @xmath35 note that the effective higgs couplings are no longer aligned to the light masses because they receive corrections that have different numerical factors .",
    "therefore we have in general both @xmath0 and higgs mediated fcnc effects .",

    "we can further suppress flavor violating effects and reduce the number of parameters if we take @xmath45 to be approximately diagonal in the same basis as @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath45 and @xmath47 leave a global @xmath48 flavor symmetry unbroken which is violated only by the heavy yukawa couplings @xmath49 , so that all flavor violating effects in the light sector are doubly suppressed by small mixing angles @xmath21 .",
    "this setup then defines our minimal model , containing only the necessary ingredients needed to explain hierarchical yukawa couplings through mass hierarchies .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the minimal model in more detail and derive the corrections to the gauge - fermion and higgs - fermion couplings that arise from the presence of the heavy fermions . in section 3",
    "we use these results to obtain approximate lower bounds on the masses of heavy fermions .",
    "it turns out that strong bounds on these masses arise from the corrections to the @xmath0 couplings and are in a few tev range .",
    "a detailed phenomenological analysis is in progress and will appear elsewhere @xcite . in section 4",
    "we discuss the connection of the minimal model to existing flavor models and in section 5 we envisage some additional structures that can be present in the heavy fermionic sector . in particular a model with a unitary yukawa matrix in the heavy quark sector appears interesting from the point of view of a further reduction of fundamental parameters .",
    "we finally conclude in section 6 .",
    "we now construct an explicit model according to the philosophy described above where we restrict our discussion to the quark sector for simplicity .",
    "the chiral field content is given by three families of quarks @xmath50 and we add for each chiral fermion a vectorlike pair of heavy quarks @xmath51 in addition to ( canonical ) kinetic terms the lagrangian is of the form @xmath52 with complex @xmath53 matrices @xmath54 and @xmath13 .",
    "we neglect other possible couplings and assume that their absence is justified by symmetries or other dynamical reasons .",
    "moreover we assume that @xmath45 and @xmath47 in each sector are approximately diagonal in the same basis , for example as a consequence of an approximate degeneracy of the heavy fermions in each sector . at the end of this section",
    "we will comment about the consequences of relaxing these assumptions .    going into the basis where @xmath45 and @xmath47 are diagonal",
    ", we can absorb possible phases in the diagonal matrices with field redefinitions , so we arrive at the lagrangian @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are diagonal matrices with positive entries . instead of",
    "@xmath57 we will use @xmath58 which are also real and positive .",
    "counting parameters , we have 18 real parameters from the masses and 18 real parameters plus 18 phases from the heavy yukawas @xmath59",
    ". we still have the freedom to do phase redefinitions for @xmath60 so we get in total 36 real parameters and 10 phases . however , 18 of these real parameters are the heavy yukawa couplings @xmath59 which we require to be anarchical @xmath9 numbers . for the phenomenological analysis to be performed in section  [ pheno ] we will denote the overall strength of these couplings by 2 single parameters @xmath61 and neglect the flavor dependence .",
    "moreover we will take the 9 heavy fermion masses to be universal in each sector , reducing their number to three @xmath62 . finally out of the 9 @xmath63 parameters 8 are determined by masses and mixings ( there is one prediction ) , leaving only @xmath64 free .",
    "thus we will describe the model by six real parameters @xmath65 , in addition to the sm ones .",
    "our next goal is to find the corrections to the sm couplings originating from the presence of heavy vectorlike fermions .",
    "rather general formulae of this type have been derived in refs .",
    "@xcite assuming the presence of direct higgs couplings to sm fermions .",
    "our formulae below extend these considerations to the cases in which such couplings are absent and yukawa couplings are only generated through mixing with heavy fermions",
    ". a detailed derivation of these results will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to derive the low - energy effective lagrangian",
    ", we first go to the mass basis in the limit of vanishing higgs vev @xmath66 and integrate out the heavy states using their equations of motion . then we include ewsb with @xmath67 gev and finally redefine light fields to get canonical kinetic terms .",
    "this redefinition brings electromagnetic currents back to the standard form , while charged and neutral currents get new contributions due to the mixing of su(2 ) doublets and singlets . in addition one finds ( multi- ) higgs couplings that are not aligned to mass terms because of the presence of explicit mass terms in the original theory .",
    "the resulting low - energy lagrangian up to @xmath68 corrections and multi - higgs couplings is given by    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71 { \\gamma^\\mu}d_{lj } + \\overline{u}_{ri }   \\left ( a^{ud}_r\\right)_{ij } { \\gamma^\\mu}d_{rj }   \\\\ j^\\mu_{\\rm neutral } & = \\overline{u}_{li } \\left [ \\delta_{ij } - \\left(a^u_l\\right)_{ij }   \\right ] { \\gamma^\\mu}u_{lj } + \\overline{u}_{ri }   \\left ( a^u_r\\right)_{ij }   { \\gamma^\\mu}u_{rj }    \\nonumber \\\\ & - \\overline{d}_{li } \\left [ \\delta_{ij } - \\left(a^d_l\\right)_{ij }   \\right ] { \\gamma^\\mu}d_{lj } -   \\overline{d}_{ri } \\left ( a^d_r\\right)_{ij } { \\gamma^\\mu}d_{rj } - 2 s_{\\rm w}^2 j^\\mu_{\\rm elmag } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the higgs boson , @xmath74 and in eq .  ( [ qeqn ] )",
    "note that the new contributions to higgs and massive gauge boson couplings are doubly suppressed by small mixing angles @xmath63 , which resembles the structure of flavor suppression in wfr and rs models and is a direct consequence of requiring the absence of light - heavy yukawa couplings , i.e. taking @xmath76 in ( [ lgen ] ) .",
    "finally let us shortly comment on the deviations from the above formulae when we depart from our minimal framework .",
    "first we have neglected operators of the form @xmath77 .",
    "they would give rise to additional contributions to flavor - violating fermion - higgs couplings that would be suppressed only by @xmath78 instead of @xmath79 , cf .",
    "eqns  ( [ deltah]),([deltahgamma ] ) .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , the resulting contributions to fcncs are not much larger than the ones from flavor violating @xmath0 couplings , so that the bounds on heavy fermion masses do not dramatically change when we allow for @xmath80 .",
    "second we have assumed that @xmath45 and @xmath47 are diagonal in the same basis .",
    "the presence of off - diagonal entries of @xmath45 in the basis where @xmath47 is diagonal would merely induce corrections to the above formulae that are proportional to ratios of off - diagonal over diagonal entries . provided that these ratios are not large , our expressions are approximately valid also in the case that the alignment of @xmath45 and @xmath47 is not exact .",
    "we now make a rough estimate of the fcnc effects induced by the effective lagrangian up to @xmath9 coefficients and leave a more detailed analysis to a future publication  @xcite . here",
    "we are only interested in obtaining a lower bound for the masses of the heavy fermions @xmath81 .",
    "we first note that the leading order expression for sm masses @xmath82 reproduces the yukawa structure in fn models , and it is well known that one can fit all sm masses and mixings when @xmath83 are @xmath9 couplings and the @xmath84 s are certain powers of a small order parameter , e.g. the cabibbo angle . in particular , since the top yukawa coupling is large and ckm matrix elements are given by @xmath85 for @xmath86 , we take @xmath87 with @xmath88 keeping @xmath89 as a free parameter that is @xmath90 .",
    "the remaining six parameters @xmath91 are then determined through the six quark masses up to @xmath9 couplings @xmath83 .",
    "we write these masses as @xmath92 where @xmath93 represents the overall strength of the original couplings @xmath94 and is only included in order to keep track of the parametric dependence of our results on these couplings",
    ". then we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to fit quark masses at 1 tev by certain powers of @xmath84 ( which are not uniquely determined since @xmath84 is not particularly small )",
    ". we will take @xmath95 which in turn gives @xmath96 since the constraints on right - handed charged currents ( parameterized by @xmath97 ) are rather weak , we concentrate in the following on higgs and @xmath0 couplings .",
    "we begin by rewriting the couplings to the higgs scalar and the @xmath0 boson in terms of sm masses in matrix notation    @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    where we have neglected terms higher order in @xmath63 and assumed that heavy fermions are approximately degenerate in each sector @xmath101 going to the light mass basis defined by @xmath102 we get for higgs couplings in this mass basis @xmath103 the @xmath0 couplings in the mass eigenstate basis read @xmath104 up to @xmath9 numbers determined by @xmath83 the dominant entries of the rotation matrices are @xmath105 for @xmath86 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "this gives @xmath108 and finally @xmath109 we are now ready to constrain the heavy masses using the bounds on fcncs mediated by higgs and @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that higgs mediated fcnc are negligible .",
    "an estimate of the coefficient of @xmath110 gives @xmath111 where the quark masses are evaluated at the scale @xmath112 .",
    "thus @xmath113 is of the order of @xmath114 for @xmath115 and a higgs mass of 115 gev , to be compared with the bound from @xmath116 that constraints the imaginary part of this coefficient to be @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "similarly for @xmath118 and @xmath119 systems the resulting coefficients are far below the bounds in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "instead the strongest bounds on the heavy fermion masses arise from the presence of flavor off - diagonal @xmath0 couplings that we write in the usual notation as @xmath120 with ( note that @xmath121 )    @xmath122    constraints on @xmath123 require @xmath124 as we found using the upper bound in ref .",
    "this translates into @xmath125 note that the bounds from @xmath0 mediated @xmath126 processes are weaker since the constraints on @xmath127 require @xmath128 to be only @xmath129 at @xmath130 , giving bounds on @xmath131 and @xmath132 that are weaker by a factor 4 .",
    "also constraints from other flavor observables are weaker , e.g. the corrections to @xmath133 are below 1% for @xmath134 .",
    "what regards the bounds on @xmath135 , large long distance contributions to the @xmath136 mass difference preclude any meaningful calculation of the lower bound on @xmath135 .",
    "in fact values of @xmath135 as low as few hundreds gev can not be excluded at present .",
    "we now compare the above bounds on heavy fermion masses coming from fcnc processes with the bounds obtained from electroweak precision data . as it has been recently emphasized in various studies performed in the context of rs models  @xcite",
    ", electroweak data also strongly constrain any deviation of the @xmath0 coupling to the left - handed @xmath137 quark . in our minimal model , the correction to @xmath138 coupling is given by @xmath139 which is @xmath140 for the above value of @xmath131 implying that @xmath141 and there is no conflict with electroweak precision data  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the general relation @xmath142 as both couplings have the same parametric dependence up to the flavor dependence of @xmath143 .",
    "one therefore expects that for flavor anarchic @xmath143 the bound on @xmath144 is as ( or even more ) important than the one on @xmath145 since @xmath146 implies @xmath147 .",
    "note however that the bounds from @xmath123 involve certain non - perturbative uncertainties .",
    "other bounds arise from the contribution of heavy fermions to the electroweak precision observables @xmath148 and @xmath149 which are roughly comparable to the flavor physics bounds  @xcite .",
    "we will provide an extensive discussion of the various phenomenological aspects in much greater detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that already the minimal fcnc effects that we are studying here give quite stringent bounds at least on @xmath131 , not much weaker than the typical constraints on the compositeness / kk scale one finds in complete models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the bounds on @xmath150 do not exclude the possibility that some of the heavy fermions could be as light as a tev .",
    "finally we comment on the impact of departing from the minimal model by including @xmath36 with typical strength @xmath151 . in this case",
    "higgs mediated fcncs are no longer negligible , but the bounds on heavy fermions increase only slightly .",
    "for example the coefficient of @xmath152 can be estimated to be @xmath153 and the bounds from @xmath116 can be satisfied by taking e.g. @xmath154 and @xmath155 for a higgs mass @xmath156 gev .",
    "finally we want to outline the connection of our model with existing flavor models by comparing complete flavor models with the general lagrangian ( [ lgen ] ) @xmath157 the bounds on heavy fermion masses derived in section [ pheno ] from @xmath0 mediated fcncs should apply to these models as well .",
    "of course in complete models there are typically additional ( and stronger ) sources of fcncs which however depend on the specific model under consideration .",
    "lagrangian ( [ lgen ] ) has been widely used as a simplified formulation  @xcite for the fermionic sector of composite higgs models  @xcite that are dual to certain warped 5d models  @xcite . in the first picture",
    "the chiral fermions represent weakly coupled elementary fields , while the vectorlike fermions are composite states that are part of a strongly interacting sector with typical masses around the tev scale .",
    "the composite sector includes the higgs boson which does not couple to elementary states implying @xmath158 .",
    "the sm fermions are then linear combinations of elementary and composite fields , typically with small components in the composites",
    ". their couplings to the higgs are then suppressed by these small mixing angles that correspond to our @xmath84 s which in this context can be interpreted as the amount of compositeness . to see the relation to warped 5d models",
    "one has to diagonalize the explicit mass terms in lagrangian ( [ lgen ] ) .",
    "the massive fermions correspond to the higher kk states , while three chiral fermions remain massless and represent the kk zero - modes .",
    "they receive their mass from ewsb through their couplings to the higgs that is localized on the ir brane .",
    "these zero - modes have a wave function profile that is governed by the 5d bulk masses .",
    "this profile has by construction an exponentially hierarchical structure which suppresses all couplings of the zero - modes and corresponds to our @xmath84 s . in both pictures",
    "the couplings of the higgs to heavy fermions are usually taken to be anarchical and @xmath9 .",
    "let us now compare our results for heavy fermions with the studies that have been done in the context of composite higgs models @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the bounds on heavy fermion masses have been obtained from tree - level higgs exchange contributions to the fcnc processes , for flavour violating couplings to the higgs boson corresponding to our general case with @xmath36 .",
    "it was shown that the constraints on the compositeness scale ( identified with the vector - like fermion mass scale ) are generically as strong as from the exchange of heavy spin-1 resonances . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is also pointed out that our special case of @xmath159 aligned with the sm yukawa couplings ( effectively similar to @xmath39 ) corresponds to a composite pseudo - goldstone higgs boson and implies much milder bounds , in agreement with our results . in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar approach is used to discuss the bounds on heavy fermion masses and on spin 1 resonances from precision electroweak data ( @xmath160 coupling , @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "one of the main results of our paper is that the most generic implication of the effective theory of fermion masses based on the lagrangian ( 1 ) are modifications of the @xmath0 boson couplings that lead to the bounds on the heavy fermion masses as strong ( or even stronger ) than the previously discussed bounds .",
    "our second point is that the effective model based on lagrangian ( 1 ) captures not only the flavour physics of composite higgs models but also that of froggatt  nielsen models @xcite .",
    "since this point has been discussed less often , we give below some details . in this case",
    "the heavy fermions play the role of messengers that communicate flavor symmetry breaking to the light fields .",
    "the mass terms @xmath45 mixing light fields and messengers arise from flavor symmetry breaking and are parameterized by the vev of a single scalar field @xmath161 in the simplest cases .",
    "typically a large number of messengers is introduced and by successively integrating out these heavy fermions higher powers of @xmath162 are generated in the lagrangian .",
    "let us start by writing the schematic lagrangian for the down - type sector and one flavon @xmath163 @xmath164 where @xmath165 are @xmath9 matrices whose structure is determined by the flavor symmetry .",

    "therefore the mere effect of integrating out heavy fields is to generate small mass terms @xmath45 and small couplings @xmath159 while @xmath49 remains @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the fermionic sector of any flavor model which satisfies the above conditions is effectively described by the minimal model ( [ lmin ] ) , generalized to include @xmath36 .    in order to illustrate that these conditions are not very difficult to satisfy",
    ", we consider the uv completion of a simple @xmath173 fn model that reproduces the light fermion mass matrices we used in section [ pheno ] . to this end",
    "we choose @xmath173 charges of the light fields as @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 and introduce a single flavon @xmath163 with charge @xmath177 , and take the higgs to be uncharged .",
    "we then introduce fn messengers @xmath178 plus conjugates which we labeled by their @xmath173 charge .",
    "in addition we have to add a certain number of these messenger fields with the same @xmath173 quantum numbers in order to reproduce sm masses @xcite , so that the total number of messengers with @xmath31 ( @xmath179 ) sm quantum numbers is 12 ( 17 ) . so we can take in total three copies of @xmath180 and say 6 copies of @xmath181 and still have only the minimal number of messengers needed .",
    "if we ( as usual ) require that the messenger masses are approximately degenerate in each sector , it is obvious that our conditions are satisfied , since apart from the third family ( where the mixing is large and @xmath182 can be absorbed into @xmath49 ) only the uncharged messengers have yukawa couplings .",
    "finally one can take a bottom - up approach and consider eq .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) as a minimal extension of the sm that parameterize small yukawa couplings through mass hierarchies . in order to make this model more predictive",
    ", one can try to reduce the number of free parameters , for example by imposing additional structure in heavy fermion sector .",
    "one interesting possibility is to impose a flavor symmetry that is intact in the heavy sector and is broken only by mass terms @xmath183 .",
    "this could explain the absence of light - heavy higgs couplings and would force @xmath81 and @xmath59 to be universal and unitary respectively , provided that heavy fermions transform in three - dimensional representations under the flavor group .",
    "while a unitary sm yukawa matrix is clearly ruled out by the data , a unitary yukawa matrix @xmath49 in the heavy fermion sector is not only allowed phenomenologically but turns out to be rather appealing for the following reasons :    * the number of fundamental parameters is reduced to 18 real and 4 phases , implying only 9 new real parameters and three new phases .",
    "this may allow to obtain interesting correlations of flavor observables . * as seen in eq .",
    "( [ alxarx ] ) in the case of a unitary @xmath49 the corrections to the sm @xmath0 couplings to light fermions become diagonal in the flavor space with the diagonal entries being proportional to @xmath184 .",
    "after the rotation to the mass eigenstates the non - universality of @xmath185 , necessary for the explanation of fermion mass hierarchies , induce tree level fcnc transitions which are suppressed not only by heavy fermion masses @xmath186 but in the case of two first generations by the differences in light quark masses .",
    "* similarly as seen in eq .",
    "( [ effy ] ) also the corrections to the sm higgs - fermion couplings become diagonal in the flavor basis implying also suppression of higgs mediated fcnc processes .",
    "we will analyze the viability of this scenario in more detail in ref .",
    "in this paper we have considered a minimal theory of fermion masses , obtained from extending the sm by heavy vectorlike fermions that mix with chiral fermions such that small sm yukawa couplings arise from small mixing angles . since under certain conditions",
    "this model can serve as an effective description of the fermionic sector of a large class of existing flavor models , it might be regarded as a useful reference frame for a further understanding of flavor hierarchies in the sm .",
    "we emphasized that already such a minimal framework gives rise to fcnc effects through exchange of massive sm bosons whose couplings to the light fermions get modified by the mixing .",
    "we derived these couplings and used the results to put lower bounds on the masses of the heavy fermions .",
    "particularly stringent bounds , in a few tev range , come from the corrections to the @xmath0 couplings . still , they do not exclude the possibility that the mass scale of the heavy fermions could be related to certain dynamics responsible for stabilizing the weak scale .",
    "some of the heavy fermions can also be lighter than a tev and thus might be in the reach of the lhc .",
    "we outlined the connection of the minimal theory with complete flavor models such as fn and rs models and discussed additional structures that could be imposed on the heavy fermionic sector .",
    "particularly appealing seems to be the possibility that heavy yukawa couplings are unitary matrices , a situation that might be enforced by flavor symmetries that remain unbroken in these sectors .",
    "an extensive analysis of several aspects related to the ideas presented in this paper will be performed in ref .",
