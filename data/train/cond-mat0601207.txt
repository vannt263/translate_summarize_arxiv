    "as a consequence of the inelasticity of collisions , granular fluids exhibit a series of behaviors that are in sharp contrast with those of molecular fluids .",
    "one of them is the absence of energy equipartition in a granular mixture of mechanically different species .",
    "the granular temperatures of the components of the mixture , defined from the average kinetic energies , are different .",
    "although this possibility was already pointed out many years ago @xcite , it has not been until recently that a systematic study of the effect has been started . for the homogeneous state of a freely cooling binary mixture of inelastic spheres , an explicit expression for the ratio of temperatures of the two components has been obtained from an approximate solution of the kinetic enskog equations @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this prediction for weak dissipation and low density has been confirmed by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the above homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) is not accesible experimentally . in order to maintain a granular system fluidized ,",
    "an external energy supply is required .",
    "this is often carried out by means of vibrating walls or external fields , that generate macroscopic gradients in the system because of inelasticity . at a theoretical level , _",
    "homogeneously driven _",
    "granular fluids have also been considered . in these models ,",
    "stochastic forces injecting energy are added , then allowing a system otherwise isolated to reach a steady state .",
    "the lack of energy equipartition in the steady state of homogeneously driven granular mixtures has been also analyzed @xcite , by extending the methods of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the relationship between this kind of driving and actual experiments is uncertain .",
    "the non - equipartition has also been confirmed by md simulations of simple shear flows @xcite and of vibrated granular gases ( in absence of gravity ) @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of the coexistence of different temperatures in strongly vibrated granular mixtures has been reported in both two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite systems .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the temperature ratio on the several parameters characterizing the system was investigated .",
    "quite surprisingly , it has been observed that the above ratio remains practically constat in the bulk of the system , in spite of the rather large gradients exhibited by each of the partial temperatures .",
    "the lack of energy equipartition has consequences on the expressions of the transport coefficients of a granular mixture @xcite .",
    "therefore , it must also affect the shape of the hydrodynamic profiles and , in particular , the density distribution of each of the components in inhomogeneous mixtures .",
    "consequently , it seems clear that the temperature difference can play a role in the segregation phenomena occurring in vibrated granular mixtures @xcite .    here ,",
    "the particular case of a low density binary mixture in the tracer limit , i.e. when the mole fraction of one of the components is very low , will be considered .",
    "the simplicity of the system allows a detailed and controlled discussion of the hydrodynamic profiles of the tracer component , that can be expressed analytically in terms of those of the other ( excess ) component .",
    "the starting point are the kinetic boltzmann equations for the mixture , and the analysis is based on the chapman - enskog method . the theory is first formulated for a general kind of states and later on particularized for the steady state of an open vibrated system .",
    "then , the theoretical predictions are compared with md simulation results , and a quite satisfactory agreement is found over a wide range of values of the parameters defining the mechanical properties of the system .",
    "a short summary of some of the results presented here was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .  [",
    "s2 ] , some on the fundamental ideas on which the chapmann - enskog method , as applied to a one - component system , is based are shortly reviewed .",
    "they are used in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , where an explicit expression for the ratio between the local temperatures of the two components is derived .",
    "this ratio only depends on the mechanical properties of the particles , being independent of the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "an extensive comparison with md results for a vibrated granular system in presence of gravity is carried out .",
    "the shape of the density profile for the tracer component is investigated in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , where an expression for the mass flux relative to the local flow is derived to first order in the gradients of the mixture fields ( navier - stokes order ) .",
    "for the particular case of the steady state of an open vibrated system , an expression for the density profile of the tracer component in terms of the fields of the excess component is obtained . since analytical forms for these fields",
    "are known , the expression can be integrated numerically .",
    "some details of this are given in the appendix .",
    "again , the theoretical predictions compare well with md simulation results , although some significant discrepancies show up as the difference in mass of the particles is increased .",
    "special emphasis is put on the relationship between the breakdown of energy equipartition and the relative position of the centers of mass of the two species .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ s5 ] contains some further discussion of the results , as well as some comments on their applicability to arbitrary states .",
    "as already said , the aim of this work is to analyze some properties of the hydrodynamic profiles of a dilute granular binary mixture in the tracer limit , i.e. when the mole fraction of one of the species is very small .",
    "more precisely , the emphasis is put on the relationship between the profiles of the tracer component and those of the mixture in an arbitrary state .",
    "it is assumed that the concentration of the tracer component is so small that its presence does not affect the state of the granular mixture that is , therefore , determined by the state of the other ( excess ) component . at a kinetic theory level , this implies that the evolution of the one - particle distribution function of the excess component obeys a closed nonlinear boltzmann equation .",
    "moreover , in the evolution of the distribution function of the tracer component , the mutual interactions between their particles can be neglected , as compared with the interactions with the particles of the excess component .",
    "consequently , its distribution obeys a linear boltzmann - lorentz equation .",
    "this is formally equivalent to consider an impurity or intruder immersed in a dilute granular gas , and this will be the terminology used in the following .",
    "let us start by shortly reviewing some basic aspects of the chapman - enskog method applied to a one - component granular gas that will be needed in the following .",
    "consider a low density gas composed by smooth inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath0 ) or disks ( @xmath1 ) of mass @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 .",

    "moreover , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the precollisional or restituting velocities , i.e. the initial values of the velocities leading to @xmath20 and @xmath21 following the binary collision defined by @xmath22 , @xmath23 macroscopic fields number density , @xmath24 , flow velocity @xmath25 , and granular temperature , @xmath26 , are defined in the usual way as velocity moments of the distribution function , @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the peculiar velocity .",
    "balance equations for the above fields are directly obtained from the boltzmann equation , @xmath31",

    "this requires to find a solution to the boltzmann equation such that all the space and time dependence occurs through @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . in the chapman - enskog procedure , this _ normal _ solution is generated by expressing it as a series expansion in a formal non - uniformity parameter @xmath44 , @xmath45 where each factor of @xmath44 means an implicit gradient of a macroscopic field .",
    "use of the above expansion in the definitions of the fluxes and the cooling rate gives a corresponding expansion for them .",
    "finally , the time derivatives of the fields are also expanded in the gradients , @xmath46 , by means of the balance equations .",

    "this choice is consistent with the solubility conditions for the set of equations generated by the chapman - enskog method @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath54 is easily generated from the distribution function for the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) of a dilute gas @xcite by substituting the homogeneous density and temperature fields by the local values @xmath24 and @xmath26 , and replacing the velocity @xmath20 by the peculiar one , @xmath55 .",

    "the procedure can be continued and navier - stokes hydrodynamic equations for a dilute granular gas , with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients in the first sonine approximation , have been derived @xcite .",
    "let us suppose now that an impurity or intruder of mass @xmath64 and diameter @xmath65 is added to the system .",
    "it is assumed that the presence of the intruder does not affect the state of the gas , so that the one - particle distribution function of the gas particles is still determined by the nonlinear boltzmann equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the macroscopic flow velocity and temperature for the mixture formed by the gas plus the intruder are the same as those for the gas alone , i.e. they are given by eqs .",

    "no particular state of either the gas or the intruder has been considered and , nevertheless , the temperature ratio is given as a function of only the mechanical properties of the particles .",
    "the existence of an expression for the temperature ratio is a consequence of the assumption that there is a hydrodynamic description of the mixture in terms of only @xmath109 , @xmath75 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , although the partial temperatures of the intruder and the gas are different , they are not needed to specify the macroscopic state of the mixture . nevertheless , the theory provides a relationship to determine them . the fact that eq .",

    "the above relation between the partial temperatures is not modified when applied to the hcs , consistently with previous results @xcite .",
    "this does not imply by itself any kind of _ local hcs approximation _ , in the same way as energy equipartition in molecular systems does not imply local equilibrium , and it is valid independently of the gradients present in the system . on the other hand , the above results do not hold if the characterization of the macroscopic state of the mixture also requires to specify the partial temperatures of the gas and the intruder and , therefore , the set of independent hydrodynamic variables ( and also the number of equations ) must be expanded .",
    "this seems to be the kind of approximation followed in @xcite .    in order to check the accuracy of the theoretical prediction given by eq",

    "the particular situation we have considered is a two - dimensional system confined in a rectangular box of width @xmath110 , open on the top , and submitted to an external field of the gravitational type , as defined above eq.([2.1 ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are enforced in the direction perpendicular to the field . to maintain the system fluidized",
    ", energy is continuously supplied through the wall located at @xmath111 , which is vibrating . for simplicity , and given that we are interested in the bulk properties of the system , the wall moves in a sawtooth way , with very small amplitude and high frequency , so that it can be considered that all the particles colliding with the wall find it at @xmath111 and with the same velocity @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the particle - wall collisions are elastic .    under the above conditions",
    ", it has been proven that a one - component granular gas reaches a stationary state with only gradients in the @xmath9-direction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this state becomes unstable and develops transversal inhomogeneities when the size of the vibrating wall is larger than a critical value @xcite .",
    "in fact , the same happens for a closed system in absence of gravity @xcite . in all the simulations to be reported in the following ,",
    "the value of @xmath110 has been taken small enough so the system stays homogeneous in the transversal direction .",
    "the above steady state is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "an example is given in fig [ fig1 ] , where the density and temperature profiles for a monodisperse system of @xmath113 particles with @xmath114 are shown . in order to plot the temperature profile on the same scale as the density one ,",
    "the former has been scaled with an arbitrary value @xmath115 . here and in the following , the units defined by @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 will be used . in these units , the data in the figure correspond to @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "these values lead to a fluidized state without transversal inhomogeneities , and with a density low enough as to expect the boltzmann equation to give an accurate description of the system .",
    "it is seen that the density profile exhibits a maximum at which @xmath121 .",
    "the existence of a density maximum is a general feature of open vibrated systems as long as the number of monolayers at rest is large enough @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature profile presents a minimum which is related with the existence of a term proportional to the density gradient in the expression of the heat flux @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig2]-[fig4 ] show the profile of the temperature ratio @xmath122 for different values of the mechanical properties of the particles .",
    "it is observed that , aside statistical fluctuations , the ratio remains practically constant in a wide region of the system , even if @xmath43 ( and @xmath85 ) varies significantly . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the influence of the inelasticity of the gas - intruder collisions on the temperature ratio is analyzed .",
    "as expected , the deviation from equipartition increases as @xmath70 decreases , becoming more different from @xmath4 .",
    "the influence of the mass ratio @xmath123 is studied in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where it is seen that the temperature ratio significantly deviates from unity when @xmath124 but @xmath70 differs significantly from @xmath4 .",
    "this is in contrast with previous findings in both experiments @xcite and md simulations @xcite of vibrated granular mixtures ( not in the tracer limit ) , probably because the several coefficients of normal restitution in those works were too close one another as to observe this deviation .",
    "the figure also shows that the boundary layer near the vibrating wall , defined as the region in which the hydrodynamic prediction is not verified , increases as the ratio @xmath123 increases .",
    "this can be explained as a consequence of the larger increase of the kinetic energy of the impurity than of the gas particles when colliding with the vibrating wall .",
    "in addition , the collisions of the intruder with the gas become less efficient in `` thermalizing '' the former .",
    "the same explanation applies to the strong fluctuations at large heights .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of @xmath125 on the diameter ratio is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , from where it can be concluded that it is quite weak .    a quantitative comparison between the theoretical prediction given by eq .",

    "( [ 2.42 ] ) , for a given value of @xmath101 , the value of @xmath98 is a function of only the parameter @xmath104 .",
    "then , the comparison will be presented by considering series of simulations in which the value of the coefficient of restitution of the gas , @xmath4 , and the diameter ratio , @xmath126 , and therefore @xmath101 are kept constant , while the mass ratio @xmath123 and the restitution coefficient @xmath70 and , therefore @xmath104 are changed . in fig.[fig5 ] , two series of data , one corresponding to @xmath127 , @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) and @xmath127 , @xmath114 ( @xmath130 ) are presented . in each case , several values of the mass ratio have been considered , as indicated in the figure .",
    "in addition , the value of the coefficient of restitution for gas - intruder collisions has also been varied in the range @xmath131 . to keep the figure readable ,",
    "we have used the same symbols for the data corresponding to the same mass ratio although different values of @xmath70 .",
    "a quite good agreement between theory and simulation is observed , specially for the largest value of @xmath4 .",
    "the small but systematic discrepancies for @xmath128 and @xmath132 are probably due to the failure of the hydrodynamic navier - stokes equations to accurately describe the state of the gas , as discussed in @xcite .    the validity of the theory to describe the dependence on the diameter ratio is checked in fig .

    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] the agreement between theory and simulation can be considered as quite satisfactory , given that no fitting parameter is being used when constructing the density profile for the impurity from the hydrodynamic profiles of the gas . on the other hand , for @xmath216 ,",
    "[ fig9 ] shows strong discrepancies between theory and simulation results .",
    "there are several possible causes for it .",
    "one is that the heavy intruder is close , on the average , to the vibrating wall and in this region the hydrodynamic description for it is not accurate , as indicated in connection with fig .",
    "in fact , the theoretical prediction for @xmath209 is maximum at the wall .",
    "another closely related possible origin of the discrepancy , is that we are assuming that the intruder does not affect the hydrodynamic profiles of the gas .",
    "this may be a bad approximation when the intruder is too massive as compared with the gas particles , specially taking into account that the number of the latter is not very large .",
    "we remind that this number can not be increased too much , in order to keep the system fluidized with low density and avoiding the transversal instability mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] .",
    "we have investigated also the density profile of the intruder for other values of the diameter ratio @xmath217 , namely @xmath218 and @xmath219 , and obtained similar results .",
    "> from @xmath209 , the average height of the intruder @xmath220 can be computed through @xmath221 the ratio @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the height of the center of mass of the gas , provides a measurement of the relative position of the intruder with respect to the gas .",
    "this ratio is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] as a function of @xmath98 for several systems with @xmath114 and @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "the solid line is the theoretical prediction and the symbols simulation results for different values of the mass ratio and @xmath70 . figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] show the same function but for @xmath213 ( @xmath226 ) and @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation is good in all cases , specially in the region close to @xmath229 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath132 it is better than it could be expected from fig .",
    "this good agreement is not surprising , since we are looking now to the simplest global property of the distribution @xmath209 . on the other hand ,",
    "the simulation results for @xmath230 are systematically above the theoretical prediction . in general",
    ", it seems that the slope of the simulation results is smaller than the theoretical prediction , although we have no explanation for it .",
    "a relevant conclusion to be reached from the above results is the dominant role played by the value of @xmath98 in determining the relative position of the intruder with respect to the gas . in an elastic system , @xmath98 is equal to the mass ratio @xmath231 , but in a granular gas @xmath98 can be larger or smaller than the mass ratio due to the lack of energy equipartition .",
    "consequently , the relative position of an intruder in a granular gas depends in a rather complicated way on the coefficients of restitution of the system , the mass ratio , and the size ratio .",
    "in this work , we have studied the hydrodynamic profiles of an impurity immersed in a low density granular gas that is in an arbitrary state .",
    "analytical predictions for the temperature and density profiles have been derived and compared with molecular dynamics simulations for the particular case of a vibrated system .",
    "a satisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreement has been found , although the discrepancies increase as the difference between the masses of the gas particles and the intruder increases . when this is the case , the boundary layer next to the vibrating wall becomes rather wide and , moreover , the intruder influences the density profile of the gas , contrary to the tracer limit assumed in the theory .",
    "the theoretical study is based on the validity of the usual chapman - enskog procedure to generate the hydrodynamic equations of the system when starting from the kinetic ( boltzmann ) equations . then , although the results are quite general and can be applied to a variety of situations as the specific one considered here , some caution is needed for other particular cases . for instance , in the so - called steady simple shear state , there is an intrinsic coupling between inelasticity and gradients @xcite .",
    "this implies that the shear rate and the coefficient of restitution can not be considered as independent quantities , and the usual chapman - enskog procedure becomes inaccurate .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation considered here , in which the gradients are controlled by the vibrating wall and the external gravitational field . in general , each physical state",
    "should be checked to verify whether a direct expansion in the gradients is legitimate .    for the ratio between the local temperatures of the intruder and the gas",
    ", the theory predicts that it is constant in the bulk of the system .",
    "this has been confirmed by the md simulations .",
    "the same behavior has been found in experiments @xcite and md simulations @xcite of vibrated systems , outside the dilute and tracer limits .",
    "nevertheless , an extension of the analysis presented in this paper @xcite , indicates that the ratio depends also on the local densities ratio .",
    "what happens is that this dependence is rather weak and gives corrections inside the statistical uncertainties for the values of the parameters considered in the above mentioned works .",
    "a qualitative discussion of the relative position of the intruder with respect to the gas was given in @xcite , where the crucial role played by the non - equipartition of energy was discussed .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that the intruder was above or below the center of mass of the gas depending on the sign of the pressure diffusion coefficient @xmath232 , that in turn is mostly determined by the sign of @xmath233 , as seen in eq.([3.32 ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the simulation results reported in figs .",
    "[ fig10]-[fig12 ] .",
    "it can be concluded that the difference in temperature of the components of a mixture must be taken into account when studying segregation phenomena , i.e. the demix of the components when shaken .",
    "of course , at higher densities and finite volume fraction of the components , other mechanisms @xcite are also important and even dominant .",
    "it is worth to mention that the work reported here provides another example of the accuracy of hydrodynamics to describe granular systems under rather extreme conditions of inelasticity .",
    "although the inelasticity of the gas has been kept small in order to avoid the transversal instability , predicted by the hydrodynamic theory itself , the coefficient of inelasticity for the gas - impurity collisions has been varied over a wide range ( typically between @xmath234 and @xmath235 ) and a reasonable good agreement between theory and simulation has been found .",
