    "the discovery of a population of high - redshift galaxies selected by their emission at submillimetre wavelengths ( submillimetre galaxies ; smgs ) has opened a new window on star formation in the high redshift universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the commonly held belief is that the submillimetre flux from these galaxies is powered by prodigious star formation rates , which can reach up @xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the star formation is so intense that a substantial fraction of the mass of the present day descendants of smgs , bright ellipticals , is thought to have been put in place during this phase @xcite .",
    "a further constraint on this picture would come from an estimate of the mass of the dark matter haloes which host smgs .",
    "measurements of the clustering of smgs have so far proved challenging @xcite .",
    "this situation has recently improved with the launch of the herschel telescope and will continue to get better with the commissioning of the new scuba-2 camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "in this paper we present predictions for the clustering of smgs using a galaxy formation model set in the framework of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology .",
    "the self - consistent modelling of smgs presents a number of challenges .",
    "the sub - mm flux from a galaxy depends , often quite strongly , on a number of galaxy properties and parameters of the dust model , such as the star formation rate , the choice of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the dust extinction ( which is driven by the optical depth of the galaxy , which in turn depends on the metallicity of the cold gas and the size of the galaxy ) , the nature and composition of the dust grains and the thermal equilibrium temperature reached by the dust grains when heated by starlight .",
    "granato et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) introduced a hybrid model which combined a calculation of the star formation histories of galaxies from the galform semi - analytical galaxy formation model ( cole et  al .",
    "2000 ) with the spectro - photometric code grasil ( silva et  al . 1998 ) , which includes radiative transfer through a two - phase dust medium and a self - consistent prediction of dust temperatures . using this model , a self - consistent calculation of the dust emission from galaxies",
    "can be made @xcite .",
    "constructing a galaxy formation model which can reproduce the observed number counts of smgs is relatively straightforward .",
    "it is more challenging to go a step further and to match the number counts and the redshift distribution of smgs at the same time .",
    "the task becomes much more difficult if , at the same time as matching the properties of high redshift galaxies , the model is also required to reproduce observations of the local galaxy population .",
    "@xcite argued that it is only possible to achieve both of these goals by changing the slope of the imf in episodes of star formation triggered by galaxy mergers . by adopting a top heavy imf in starbursts , and by making the implied changes to the yield of metals and the fraction of gas recycled from dying stars , baugh et  al .",
    "were able to reproduce basic properties of smgs .",
    "at the same time , the same model matches the observed luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies from @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xcite , as well as being in good agreement with many observations of local galaxies .",
    "nevertheless this model remains controversial and leads to conclusions which challenge the commonly accepted wisdom about smgs .",
    "for example , gonzlez et  al .",
    "( 2010b ) investigated the nature of smgs in the baugh et  al .",
    "model and found that the smg phase is not responsible for the formation of a significant amount of long lived stars .",
    "here we present a further test of the model by presenting predictions for the clustering of smgs .    to date",
    ", there are suggestions that smgs are strongly clustered , with a correlation length that is substantially larger than that expected for the dark matter at the typical redshift of smgs ( e.g. blain et  al . 2004 ) . however , the clustering measurements are currently noisy as a result of the small volumes surveyed , with this scatter being exacerbated by the strong clustering of the smgs ( scott et  al .",
    "2002 ; 2006 ; borys et  al . 2004",
    "; weiss et al 2009 ) .",
    "there is only limited agreement between estimates of the angular clustering of smgs , and poor agreement in turn between these measurements and the clustering inferred in three dimensions .",
    "the first results from the herschel mission demonstrate the challenge of measuring the clustering of smgs .",
    "cooray et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported a detection of angular clustering in a sample of galaxies selected at 250  @xmath8 m from the herschel hermes survey , which they estimate to have a similar redshift distribution to the `` classical '' smgs selected at 850  @xmath8 m , while maddox et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , on the other hand , found no evidence for angular clustering for a galaxy sample selected in a similar way from the herschel atlas survey .",
    "however , this situation is likely to improved rapidly as the herschel surveys increase in size and are analysed in more detail .",
    "also , the scuba-2 camera is currently being installed at the jcmt .",
    "the cosmology legacy survey using scuba-2 will produce a map of @xmath9 deg@xmath10 at @xmath11 m , substantially bigger than the shades half - degree extragalactic survey .",
    "there are currently few predictions for the clustering of smgs .",
    "van kampen et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) compiled predictions for the angular clustering of smgs from several groups .",
    "these calculations were phenomenological and did not attempt to predict the sub - mm flux from galaxies .",
    "the models were constrained by hand to match the smg number counts .",
    "here we make a direct prediction of which galaxies satisfy the selection criteria to appear in an smg sample .",
    "gas dynamic simulations are currently unable to provide meaningful predictions as the box sizes used are too small to predict clustering robustly beyond a scale on the order of a megaparsec .",
    "furthermore , in many cases these calculations stop at high redshift ( again due to the small box size ) and so can not be tested against the local galaxy population . by using a semi - analytical approach ,",
    "the computational resources can be devoted to modelling the evolution of the dark matter component , allowing us to use a representative cosmological volume .",
    "in this paper we use the +  model to populate the millennium simulation of the evolution of structure in a cold dark matter universe @xcite .",
    "this simulation occupies a volume of @xmath12mpc on a side and contains more than 20 million dark matter haloes at the present day .",
    "the cpu required by  makes it impractical to compute the spectral energy distribution for every galaxy directly in the millennium simulation .",
    "instead , we apply a novel technique based on artifical neural networks ( ann ) which we introduced in paper i to populate the simulation with galaxies @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief summary of the +  model and explain how the artificial neural network is implemented .",
    "we show how well the model can predict the submillimetre luminosity of galaxies in section 3 .",
    "in section 4 we present the predictions for the spatial and angular clustering of smgs .",
    "the dependence of the clustering on selected galaxy properties is explored in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present our conclusions .",
    "here we give a brief summary of the semi - analytical galaxy formation model , (   [ section : galform ] ) , the spectro - photometric model used to compute galaxy seds , (   [ section : grasil ] ) and the artificial neural network ( ann ) technique used to predict spectral properties for large samples of galaxies .",
    "further details and tests of this approach can be found in @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we use the  galaxy formation model to follow the fate of baryons in a @xmath13cdm universe . the general methodology behind semi - analytical modelling",
    "is explained in the review by @xcite , and a more advanced overview of galaxy formation physics is given by @xcite .",

    "descriptions of subsequent extensions to the model are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a summary of the model used in this paper , that of @xcite , can be found in @xcite and @xcite , where the processes modelled are described and the parameters used to specify the model are listed .",
    "two changes from the original baugh et  al . set up are made as a result of the implementation of the model in the millennium simulation of springel et  al .",
    "firstly , the cosmological parameters of the millennium are different from those adopted in the baugh et  al .",

    "rms _ fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath18 mpc of @xmath19 .",
    "the original baugh et  al .",
    "model also assumes a flat @xmath13cdm cosmology but with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "] we have found that by adjusting the baryon density parameter from the baugh et  al .",
    "value of @xmath24 to @xmath25 to give the same baryon fraction , @xmath26 , as used in the original model , we obtain similar predictions for the galaxy luminosity function to those obtained in the original model .",
    "secondly , we use the merger histories of the dark matter haloes extracted directly from the millennium , constructed using the prescription described in @xcite .    an important feature of the baugh et  al . model , particularly for the properties of galaxies selected by their dust emission , is the form of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) adopted in different modes of star formation .",
    "bursts of star formation , which in this model are triggered by certain types of galaxy merger , are assumed to produce stars with a top - heavy imf , where d@xmath27d@xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "bursts are initiated by all major mergers ( i.e. those in which the mass in cold gas and stars of the accreted galaxy account for 30% or more of the primary s mass ) and by minor mergers in which the accreted satellite makes up at least 5% of the primary s mass and where the primary is gas rich ( defined as 75% of the primary mass being in the form of cold gas ; these figures are model parameters ) .",
    "quiescent star formation in galactic disks is assumed to produce stars according to a solar neighbourhood imf , the @xcite imf , with @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the adoption of a top - heavy imf in starbursts is the key to reproducing the observed number counts and redshift distribution of faint sub - mm galaxies ( @xcite ) . while this choice is controversial , a variety of observational evidence suggests that in some environments the imf may have a higher proportion of high - mass stars than in the solar neighbourhood imf ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the semi - analytical model is ideally placed to investigate the consequences for other predicted properties of assuming a top - heavy imf in bursts .",
    "a number of predictions have been found to be in better agreement with observations following the use of different imfs in the burst and quiescent modes of star formation , such as the metallicities of intra - cluster gas and of stars in early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the precise form of the imf is not important so long as a higher proportion of high mass stars are produced than would be the case with a solar neighbourhood imf .",
    "similar predictions would be obtained for an imf with a standard slope which is truncated below a few solar masses . with a larger fraction of massive stars produced relative to the kennicutt imf",
    ", more energy is radiated in the uv and larger amounts of dust are produced due to the enhanced yield of metals .    in the next subsection",
    "we describe the  spectro - photometric code which generates a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy across a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "itself makes an independent calculation of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of starlight , including a model for dust extinction which is described in @xcite .",
    "this calculation gives similar results to those obtained with   at optical wavelengths .",
    "the  calculation of the v - band luminosity weighted age and optical depth are used as inputs to the ann .      to accurately predict the seds of galaxies , from the far - uv to the radio",

    "( 2000 ) and tested by @xcite and @xcite , and the cold gas mass ( as compared against observations by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the dust is modelled as a two - phase medium , with a diffuse component and dense molecular clouds .",
    "the mass split between these components is a model parameter . in the baugh",
    "model , 25 per cent of the dust is assumed to be in the form of dense clouds .",
    "stars form within molecular clouds and escape on a timescale @xmath34 , which is another model parameter ; in @xcite , a value of @xmath35 myr is adopted in both quiescent and burst modes of star formation .",
    "the extinction of starlight by dust clouds depends on the star s age relative to the escape time .",
    "high mass stars , which typically dominate the emission in the uv , spend a significant fraction of their comparatively short lifetimes within molecular clouds .",
    "calculates the radiative transfer of starlight through the dust and self - consistently solves for the temperature distribution of the dust grains at each point in the galaxy , based on the local radiation field .",
    "the temperature distribution of the grains is then used to calculate the dust emission .",
    "the composition and size of the dust grains are chosen to match the properties of the local ism : a mixture of graphite and silicate grains , as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "the effects of temperature fluctuations in very small grains and pah molecules are taken into account .",
    "emission from pahs is calculated using the cross - sections of @xcite .",
    "radio emission from ionised hii regions and synchrotron radiation is included as in @xcite .",
    "the  model has been calibrated against local observational data for normal and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "a limitation of  is that it assumes axisymmetric distributions for the gas and dust in starburst galaxies .",
    "there is observational evidence of more complex geometries and extraplanar dust in some galaxies ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this could be problematic if this dust absorbed and emitted a significant fraction of radiation . however , there is little observational evidence for this .",
    "furthermore , observations of nearby starbursts reveal that most of the absorption and emission of radiation by dust takes place in a compact region of size @xmath36 kpc or less .",
    "has been shown to accurately predict the seds of both quiescent and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the  code provides an accurate calculation of the absorption and reemission of radiation by dust , predicting the sed of a galaxy from the far - uv to radio .",
    "however ,  is extremely cpu intensive , requiring several minutes to compute the sed for a single galaxy , which prohibits its direct application to extremely large numbers of galaxies . in @xcite",
    "we introduced a new technique based on artificial neural networks ( ann ) which can be used to rapidly predict seds using a small set of galaxy properties as input , once the ann has been trained on a relatively small number ( @xmath37 ) of galaxies with seds computed using .",
    "we demonstrated that , in the majority of cases , this method can predict the luminosities of galaxies to within 10 per cent of the values computed directly using .",
    "we employ the same approach in this paper .",
    "the general methodology behind the ann is set out in detail in @xcite , so we give only a brief summary here .",
    "@xcite recently published a complementary approach in which the explicit calculation of emission by dust within  is replaced by an ann .",
    "artificial neural networks are mathematical models designed to replicate the behaviour of the human brain .",
    "they are similar to their biological counterparts in the sense that anns consist of simple computational units , neurons , which are interconnected in a network .",
    "the neurons are usually organized in layers : an input layer , one or more hidden layers and an output layer .",
    "each neuron has a weight associated with it . in this paper",
    "we will use a multilayer , feed - forward network .",
    "the ann is trained using a sample of galaxies for which  has been run to compute spectra . during the training process",
    ", the neural network is presented with a set of inputs , comprised of selected galaxy properties , and associated outputs , in our case the luminosity at different wavelengths .",
    "the network weights are adjusted in order to reproduce , as closely as possible , the desired output from the given set of inputs . in summary : ( i ) we start with an untrained net ( random weights ) ; ( ii ) determine the output for a given input ; ( iii ) compute the discrepancy or error between the predicted and the target output ; and ( iv ) adjust the weights in order to reduce this error . to adjust the weights we use the resilient backpropagation learning algorithm @xcite .    as in @xcite , we use 12 galaxy properties predicted by  as input to the ann : the total stellar mass , the stellar metallicity , the unextincted stellar bolometric luminosity , the disk and bulge half - mass radii and the circular velocities measured at these two radii , the v - band weighted age , the optical depth of dust extinction in the v - band , the metallicity of the cold gas , the mass of stars formed in the last burst and the time since the start of the last burst of star formation .",
    "@xcite showed that the performance of the ann is greatly improved if we predict only one output property , the luminosity in a single band - pass , instead of predicting the full sed of the galaxy ( which typically covers 456 wavelength bins for a standard  sed ) .",
    "we then train the ann separately for each band required . here , we follow the same approach : we train two separate networks , one for each of the sub - mm wavelengths at which we want to predict luminosities ( @xmath38 m and @xmath11 m ) .",
    "the network configuration adopted has 12 neurons in the input layer , two hidden layers with 30 neurons each and one output neuron .",
    "we also found , in order to maximise the accuracy of the ann predictions , that it was necessary to train the ann at each redshift of interest , and to train separately for galaxies whose star formation is dominated by starbursts or quiescent star formation in disks .",

    "nonetheless the technique returns more than 90% of predicted sub - mm luminosities within 10 per cent of the true values .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath43 , the highest redshift considered , the observer - frame @xmath11 m luminosity probes the rest - frame @xmath44 m , which is approaching the peak in the dust emission spectrum ( typically around @xmath45 m ) .    one important feature of the error distribution is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "<S> we combine the  semi - analytical model of galaxy formation , which predicts the star formation and merger histories of galaxies , the  spectro - photometric code , which calculates the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies self - consistently including reprocessing of radiation by dust , and artificial neural networks ( ann ) , to investigate the clustering properties of galaxies selected by their emission at submillimetre wavelengths ( smgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the millennium simulation to predict the spatial and angular distribution of smgs . at redshift @xmath0 , we find that these galaxies are strongly clustered , with a comoving correlation length of @xmath1mpc for galaxies with 850@xmath2 flux densities brighter than 5 mjy , in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that at higher redshifts these galaxies trace denser and increasingly rarer regions of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we present the predicted dependence of the clustering on luminosity , submillimetre colour , halo and total stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we predict tight relations between correlation length and halo and stellar masses , independent of sub - mm luminosity .    </S>",
