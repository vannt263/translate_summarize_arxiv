    "the fact that for volume preserving flows and real valued potentials , the operator @xmath8 is an unbounded , essentially self adjoint operator on @xmath9 might suggest , that @xmath8 has good spectral properties on @xmath9 . however , due to the lack of ellipticity @xmath8 has mainly continuous spectrum which carries little information on the dynamics of the flow .",
    "a very important progress was thus to construct banach spaces @xcite or hilbert spaces @xcite for anosov flows in which the operator @xmath8 has discrete spectrum in a sufficiently large region ( see also @xcite for analogous results for anosov diffeomorphism ) .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown that there is a family of hilbert spaces @xmath10 parametrized by @xmath11 such that for any @xmath12 and for sufficiantly large @xmath13 the operator @xmath8 acting on @xmath10 has discrete spectrum in the region @xmath14 .",
    "this discrete spectrum is known to be intrinsic to the anosov flow together with the potential function and does not depend on the sufficiantly large parameter @xmath13 ( see section  [ sec : micro_ruelle ] for a more precise statement ) .",
    "accordingly we call @xmath15 a _ pollicott - ruelle resonance _ if it is an eigenvalue of @xmath8 on @xmath10 for sufficiently large @xmath13 and we call @xmath16 the space of _ pollicott - ruelle resonant states_. as @xmath17 is not anymore a normal operator on @xmath10 , there might exist also exist finite dimensional jordan blocks and given a ruelle resonance @xmath18 we denote by @xmath19 the maximal size of a corresponding jordan block and we call @xmath20 the space of _ generalized pollicott - ruelle resonant states_.    the interest in these pollicott - ruelle resonances and their resonant states arises from the fact that they govern the decay of correlations . in order to illustrate this in more detail ,",
    "let us for the moment assume that the anosov flow is contact , which includes for example all geodesic flows on compact manifolds with negative sectional curvature . if we denote by @xmath21 the invariant contact volume form and take two smooth functions @xmath22 , then one is interested in the behavior of the correlation function @xmath23 in this case the following expansion of the correlation function has been established in ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore @xmath28 are the corresponding left and right generalized eigenstates and the sum over @xmath29 arises from the possible existence of jordan blocks of size @xmath30 . as @xmath31 all terms except the first one vanish exponentially in the limit of large times .",
    "this effect is interpreted as an exponential convergence towards equilibrium , known as exponential mixing and has first been established in the seminal works of dolgopyat @xcite and liverani @xcite .",
    "the way towards equilibrium is governed by the sub leading resonances and resonant states . while the resonances determine the possible decay modes , the resonant states determine the coefficients . if for example there would be a simple pollicott - ruelle resonance @xmath25 with a resonant state , that vanishes on an open set @xmath32 , then for all observables @xmath33 this resonance would not appear in the correlation expansion ( [ eq : cor_expansion ] ) .",

    "note that contrary to the correlation expansion ( [ eq : cor_expansion ] ) which we mentioned as a motivation , our result for the resonant states holds for a general @xmath0 anosov flow with no assumption on contact structures , smooth invariant measures , or even mixing properties . taking a suspension of a topological transitive anosov diffeomorphism , the theorem directly implies an analogous result for the resonant states of the anosov diffeomorphism .    to our knowledge there",

    ", there is however only one simple peripheral eigenvalue so the statement applies only to this one resonant state which corresponds to the equilibrium measure .",
    "furthermore for the particular case of a geodesic flows on manifolds of constant negative curvature , dyatlov , faure and guillarmou @xcite proved an explicit relation between pollicott - ruelle resonant states and laplace eigenstates .",
    "using this relation allows to transfer well established support properties of laplace eigenstates to support properties of pollicott - ruelle eigenstates .",

    "thus we can define an open set @xmath280 such that the union of connected components of @xmath277 that contain a connected component of @xmath271 is given by @xmath281 with this definition we obviousely have @xmath282 we now can define the opens set @xmath283 and obtain @xmath284 as @xmath285 is a diffeomorphism , it only remains to prove that @xmath286 .",
    "this , however , is an immediate consequence of @xmath287 ( which uses the ergodicity w.r.t .",
    "the srb measure ) as well as the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : neighbour_prod_measure ] let @xmath90 be the srb measure , and @xmath288 with @xmath289 then @xmath290 .",
    "using the fact that the srb measure is absolutely continuous w.r.t .",
    "the weak unstable foliation we can write @xmath291 now , let us analyze the function @xmath292 .",
    "for @xmath293 we known from the definition of our charts , that @xmath294 is diffeomorphic to @xmath142 .",
    "as @xmath295 comes from a riemannian metric this induced measure is equivalent to lebesgue measure on @xmath142 and thus the assumption @xmath289 implies @xmath296 . as @xmath297 is a positive density this implies @xmath298 .",
    "now let us consider an arbitrary other point @xmath299 .",
    "we want to show , that also the sets @xmath300 are of positive measure w.r.t .",
    "this however is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath302 has positive measure together with the fact , that the strong stable holonomy maps are absolutely continuous ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.6.2 ) ) .",
    "again the positivity of the density @xmath303 implies @xmath304 .",
    "@xmath305 is thus a strictly positive measurable function and consequently @xmath306 .",
    "we are now able to prove theorem  [ thm : support ] :    let @xmath18 be a pollicott - ruelle resonance , @xmath307 an associated generalized resonant state and suppose that @xmath308 .",
    "let @xmath309 be the unique integer , such that @xmath310 as the differential operator @xmath8 is local we have @xmath311 .",
    "furthermore because @xmath312 , the support @xmath313 is invariant by the ansosov flow so we can apply lemma  [ lem : full_measure_tubes ] to @xmath314 . thus we obtain a cover @xmath129 of product neighborhoods as well as open subsets @xmath255 fullfilling @xmath315 after a possible further refinement we can also guarantee the existence of @xmath0-charts @xmath316 as well as closed cones @xmath317 fulfilling ( [ eq : un_stable_cones ] ) .",
    "now let us choose a smooth partition of unity @xmath318 and define @xmath319 .",
    "recall from ( [ eq : wavefront_cond ] ) that @xmath250 implies @xmath320 and by ( [ eq : un_stable_cones ] )",
    "this implies that @xmath321 .",
    "now , using lemma  [ lem : rho_a_prod_estimate ] , we obtain for an arbitrary borel set @xmath151 the estimate @xmath322|\\leq c_{u_i}{\\textup{vol}}_{n_{wu}}(a)$ ] .",
    "we now want to use this estimate in order to conclude , that @xmath323 for all @xmath324 .",
    "now for any @xmath325 let us introduce the set @xmath326 as @xmath327 are open , also the family @xmath328 is a family of open sets , that increases monotonously and converges to @xmath269 for @xmath329 .",
    "considering the complement @xmath330 we obtain a monotonously decreasing family of closed sets converging to the nullset @xmath331 .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ eq : ni_suppu ] ) we see that the distribution @xmath332 defined in ( [ eq : rho_a ] ) is equal to @xmath333 on an open neighborhood of @xmath334 . taking an arbitrary @xmath153 and any @xmath325",
    "we can use this fact to calculate @xmath335 = ( u_i\\cdot \\psi)[1 ] = ( ( u_i\\cdot\\psi)\\cdot \\rho_{n^c_{i,\\varepsilon}})[1].\\ ] ] but as the multiplication by a smooth function does nt increase the wavefront set we can apply lemma  [ lem : rho_a_prod_estimate ] to @xmath336 and obtain for any @xmath337 @xmath338| \\leq c_{u_i,\\psi } { \\textup{vol}}_{n_{wu}}(n_{i,\\varepsilon}^c).\\ ] ] finally , as the constants @xmath339 are independent of @xmath337 , the right hand side converges to zero as @xmath329 , so we have shown @xmath340=0 $ ] . as @xmath153 was an arbitrary test function this implies @xmath341 for any @xmath270 and we conclude that @xmath342 which is a contradiction .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem  [ thm : support ] .",
    "in the proof of the support property of the pollicott - ruelle resonant states , the smoothness of the conditional measures ( theorem  [ thm : anosov_fubini ] ) plays a central role .",
    "while the result is well known to experts in dynamical system theory it is difficult to find a precise statement or a proof in the existing literature .",
    "this is why i wanted to provide some more details in the arxiv - version of this article , on how to connect the smoothness of the conditional densities to the smoothness of holonomy maps , by standard dynamical systems arguments :    let @xmath177 be the range of a coordinate chart @xmath147 as in theorem  [ thm : anosov_fubini ] .",
    "as we only work in one fixed chart , we drop the index @xmath270 in order to simplify the notation and write @xmath343 .",
    "recall that we have already defined @xmath344 and analogousely we define @xmath345 .",
    "recall that the strong stable manifolds define a foliation of @xmath346 by the leaves @xmath184 which are parametrized by @xmath347 .",
    "note that @xmath348 so it can be identified with @xmath349 .",
    "now for any @xmath350 we define @xmath351 which defines a smooth foliation transversal to the foliation @xmath184 .",
    "recall that by the construction of the coordinate charts ( [ eq : chart_properties ] ) , @xmath352 coincides with a weak unstable leaf , but in general the other leaves can not coincide with the weak unstable leaves unless the particular case , that the weak unstable foliation is smooth .",
    "let us now reduce the set @xmath346 such that it has a product structure w.r.t .",
    "the foliations @xmath184 and @xmath353 , i.e. such that for all @xmath347 and @xmath350 one has @xmath354 defines a unique point contained in @xmath346 .",
    "note that this poses not problem for proving the theorem which claims the existences of the conditional measures in some product neighborhood of the strong stable and weak unstable foliation as such a set is always contained in the reduced set @xmath346 .",
    "now with this product structure of @xmath184 and @xmath353 we can define two holonomy maps @xmath355 and @xmath356 let us first discuss the second one , belonging to the smooth transversal foliation . according to theorem  [ thm : cont_depend_inv_mflds ] , @xmath357 is a @xmath0 diffeomorphism and depends continuously on @xmath86 in the @xmath0-topology .",
    "note that the euclidean metric on @xmath346 induces metrics and thus measures on the submanifolds @xmath184 which we call @xmath358 and as @xmath359 is simply the @xmath87-axis @xmath360 is simply the euclidean measure @xmath361 on @xmath349 after identifying @xmath359 and @xmath349 . the fact that @xmath357 are diffeomorphisms gives us a jacobian function @xmath362 such that for a any function @xmath363 @xmath364 the theorem of change of variables gives us , the precise form of @xmath365 : for any @xmath366 the differential of the holonomy maps is a linear isomorphism @xmath367 choosing two orthonormal basis of the @xmath368-dimensional subspaces @xmath369 and @xmath369 ( w.r.t .  to the euclidean metric on @xmath370 ) the differential can be expressed as an @xmath371 matrix and the jacobian is simply the absolute value of the determinant .",
    "now the fact , that @xmath372 is @xmath0 and depends continuously on @xmath86 translates to the fact that @xmath373 and depends continuously on @xmath86 w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath0-topology .",
    "let us now turn to the holonomy maps of the strong stable foliation .",
    "here the situation is infinitely more complicated , as for a general anosov flow the maps @xmath374 are only hlder continuous homeomorphisms .",
    "however it is known that they are absolutely continuous and that they possess a jacobian @xmath375 such that for any function @xmath376 @xmath377 the existence of such jacobians for holonomies in dynamical systems can be found in various textbooks ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) .",
    "it is however more difficult to find sharp statements on their regularity in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the following sufficiently strong statement for our purpose can for example be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix e )      let us now combine all the ingredients in order to calculate the conditional densities .",
