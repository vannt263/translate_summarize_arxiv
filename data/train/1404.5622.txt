    "the investigation of ultracold atomic gases has produced several breakthrough results in the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "atomic gases are used to simulate many - body systems without the presence of disorder , intricate band structures etc . , which significantly complicates the understanding of conventional condensed matter systems .",
    "one limitation is that the atom - atom interaction is typically short range and isotropic ( @xmath0-wave ) , whereas the order parameters in nature often exhibit richer @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave symmetries .",
    "the impressive progress in the production of cold gases consisting of fermionic hetero - nuclear molecules with an electric dipole moment  @xcite promises to remove this limitation , since the dipole - dipole interaction is long - range and anisotropic with both repulsive and attractive parts  @xcite .",
    "the attractive head - to - tail part of the dipole - dipole interaction can lead to severe losses via chemical reactions , which however can be suppressed by orders of magnitude by confining the dipoles to low dimensional geometries  @xcite , or by using molecules which are chemically stable such as @xmath3  @xcite or @xmath4 .",
    "dipolar gases are predicted to exhibit a wealth of new phases in 2d , including @xmath1-wave superfluids  @xcite as well as quantum liquid crystals such as nematic  @xcite , density - wave ( smectic )  @xcite and hexatic phases  @xcite .",
    "the presence of both superfluid and liquid crystal order occurs in several strongly correlated systems , and it plays a central role in the physics of the cuprate and pnictide superconductors  @xcite .",
    "we analyse in this paper the zero temperature ( @xmath5 ) properties of the density - wave phase of a 2d gas of fermionic dipoles aligned by an external field . in this phase ,",
    "the dipoles form density waves ( stripes ) in order to minimise the repulsive side - by - side part of the interaction .",
    "several groups have predicted a 2d dipolar gas to form such a striped phase for large dipole moments  @xcite .    partitioning momentum space into one dimensional brillouin zones",
    ", we develop a conserving hartree - fock approximation ( hfa )  @xcite , which is shown to recover previous results for the critical coupling strength for the onset of stripe formation .",
    "the resulting equations are solved self - consistently , and we calculate the amplitude of the stripes as a function of the dipole moment and its orientation with respect to the 2d plane .",
    "we then calculate the quasi - particle spectrum and show that the 1d brillouin zone structure gives rise to a fermi surface with gapless as well as gapped regions . as a result ,",
    "the system remains compressible , and the formation of stripes does not stabilise the system against collapse for large dipole attraction .",
    "the presence of stripes is demonstrated to have clear signatures in the momentum distribution and to give rise to characteristic momentum correlations , both of which can be measured in time - of - flight experiments .",

    "a non - zero value of @xmath13 leads to qualitatively the same physics with only a small shift in the critical coupling strength for stripe formation , as long as @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the instability towards forming a striped phase is signalled by a zero frequency pole in the density - density response function at a given wave number @xmath36  @xcite .",

    "each dipole experiences the mean - field potential from the other dipoles which is periodic in the direction perpendicular to the stripes .",
    "it follows that a dipole with momentum @xmath18 is coupled only to dipoles with momenta @xmath53 with @xmath54 an integer .",
    "this allows us to think of @xmath55-space in terms of having a 1d brillouin zone structure in the direction of @xmath56 and an unrestricted @xmath55-space in the direction perpendicular to @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore partition the 2d @xmath55-space into slices of width @xmath57 , by starting with the first brillouin zone @xmath58 defined as the points @xmath18 such that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath56 .",

    "in addition to the elliptical shape of the fermi sea , the striped phase is characterised by a smearing out of the momentum distribution in the regions located around the edge of the fermi sea with @xmath108 , i.e.  @xmath109 .",

    "we emphasize that the analysis presented here based on the mean - field approach is the first one to describe the broken symmetry striped phase .",
    "also , the mean - field results presented here such as the smoking gun features of the striped phase in the momentum distribution , must be expected to be qualitatively correct .",
    "the striped phase spontaneously breaks translational symmetry , and it is therefore a quantum analogue of the classical smectic phases  @xcite .",
    "quantum nematic and smectic phases play a significant role for many interesting electronic materials which have been discovered in the last couple of decades  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the electron systems , which are plagued by impurities , intricate band structures , lattice defects and distortions , that complicate a systematic analysis , ultracold dipolar gases are extremely clean and in addition experimentally very flexible .",
    "they therefore provide a great opportunity to investigate the formation of a smectic phase in a controlled and pure setting . in this paper",
    ", we approach these phases from the weak - coupling perspective , where the phases arise from the successive breaking of symmetries of an underlying fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "the interaction strength depends strongly on the type of molecule used in an experiment , since it scales with @xmath142 . as an example , consider the chemically stable @xmath3 . to give a conservative estimate of experimentally realistic values , we refer to refs .  , where the jila group reports a maximum value of the induced dipole moment @xmath143 of about @xmath144 for the chemically unstable @xmath145 , and a maximum density of @xmath146 in a pancake geometry .",
    "if the same values are used for @xmath3 , it corresponds to @xmath147 which is well within the striped phase as calculated in mean - field theory presented here .",
    "similar parameters for the other chemically stable molecule @xmath148 gives @xmath149 , and taking @xmath150 yields @xmath151 . provided",
    "one can overcome difficulties related to the fact that @xmath152 is chemically reactive by using the 2d geometry , the large permanent dipole moment @xmath153 debye of this molecule means that one can even achieve the very high coupling strength @xmath154 for the same density .",
    "these very different values illustrate the quadratic dependence of the coupling strength on the dipole moment , which means that experiments likely will be able to probe a large region of the phase diagram .",
    "one should therefore be able to investigate the critical value for stripe formation , which is presently not settled theoretically as discussed above .",
    "an interesting consideration is the effects of temperature .",
    "a finite and small temperature broadens the momentum distribution leading to less sharp signatures . in the strict 2d limit ,",
    "no true long range order exists at non - zero temperature , and the phase transition to the homogenous phase is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type  @xcite . for increasing temperatures , defects in the form of insertion and disappearance of stripes",
    "will proliferate eventually melting the stripes . in the strongly interacting limit",
    "we expect the bkt temperature to be proportional to the density , however the constant of proportionality has yet to be calculated .",
    "this will be explored in future work .",
    "we studied the @xmath5 properties of the striped phase of a 2d system of fermionic dipoles aligned by an external field .",
    "a hartree - fock theory was developed , which was shown to recover previous results for the critical coupling strength for stripe formation .",
    "the amplitude of the stripes was calculated as a function of the dipole moment and orientation , and the quasiparticle spectrum of the striped phase was shown to exhibit a 1d brillouin zone structure with gapped as well as gapless regions around the fermi surface .",
    "the system therefore remains compressible in the striped phase , and it collapses for essentially the same dipole strength as in the normal phase .",
    "we showed that the striped phase has clear signatures in the momentum distribution and in the momentum correlations , which can both be measured in tof experiments .",
    "finally , we discussed how the striped phase can be realised with experimentally relevant molecules .",
    "we are grateful to nikolaj zinner for discussions and to the centre for scientific computing in aarhus for computation time .",
    "gmb would like to acknowledge the support of the carlsberg foundation via grant 2011 01 0264 and the villum foundation via grant vkr023163 .",
    "to argue for the truncation of @xmath55-space , we examine the calculation of the static density - density response function @xmath155 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath156 signifies the instability of the system towards forming density waves with wave vector @xmath157  @xcite and thus marks the boundary of the dw phase .",
    "the self consistent mean - field theory employed in this study is an extension of the conserving@xcite hfa to the density - density response function as calculated in @xcite .",
    "so examining the latter approach gives an indication of which @xmath55-states are relevant in the vicinity of the phase transition . as shown in @xcite , the internal matsubara frequencies in the exchange plus direct interaction approximation to @xmath155 only appear in the particle - hole propagator @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the 2 + 1 momentum and @xmath160 is the fully dressed single particle greens function .",
    "the matsubara frequency sum is trivial so @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the hartree fock single particle energy as given by . here",
    "we can see that particle - hole propagator is given exactly by the coupling between the occupied states of the lowest band @xmath163 to the two bands @xmath164 which is captured by the three band model described in section  [ sec : three - band - theory ] .",
