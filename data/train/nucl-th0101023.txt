    "hadron multiplicities per unit rapidity at sps energy show an approximate scaling with the number of participants .",
    "this property is known as `` wounded nucleon model '' ( wnm ) @xcite . however",
    ", a precise determination of the ratio @xmath0 , both at cern - sps @xcite and at rhic @xcite , shows a steady increase from peripheral to central collisions . this increase is larger at rhic energies , where the data show no saturation for the most central bins .",
    "it is a widespread belief that `` soft '' processes lead to a scaling in @xmath1 while `` hard '' ones lead to a scaling with the number @xmath2 of binary collisions . while , this is the case for total cross - sections , it is not so for single particle inclusive cross - sections .",
    "if one neglects the effects of shadowing ( i.e. nuclear effects in structure functions associated to triple pomeron interactions ) , there is a theorem known as abramovski , gribov , kancheli ( agk ) cancellation @xcite , based on general principles , according to which @xmath3 scales with @xmath2 at mid - rapidities and asymptotic energies .",
    "the best way to understand this cancellation is to illustrate it with a model that satisfies these general principles , namely the glauber model .",
    "the derivation of ( [ 3e ] ) assumes that the inclusive cross - section for @xmath2 inelastic collisions is @xmath2 times the corresponding one for a single collision ( or , more generally , that the hadronic plateau produced in an inelastic collision does not depend on the number of inelastic collisions ) .",
    "clearly , such a condition is only true at mid - rapidities and for asymptotic energies .",
    "a basic idea in the wnm is that a nucleon ( here the projectile ) , when wounded once , looses its ability to produce extra particles in further collisions",
    ". this may be valid at low energies , when the projectile undergoes successive collisions with the nucleons of the target .",
    "however , at high energies , the space - time development of the interaction implies that the @xmath2 collisions are `` parallel '' , i.e. they originate from different constituents of the projectile wave function and take place simultaneously .",
    "( technically , it means that one is dealing with non - planar diagrams ) .",
    "this is the so - called glauber - gribov model @xcite",
    ". a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .    as discussed above , at finite energies the constraints of energy - momentum conservation lead to a violation of the agk cancellation .",
    "the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite and the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite , while obeying agk cancellation at mid rapidities and asymptotic energies , contain an `` educated guess '' on its violation at finite energies .",
    "these models are based on the quark - gluon content of hadrons in the framework of the glauber - gribov model , and on the large @xmath7 expansion of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the charged multiplicities per unit rapidity are given by @xcite              the average number of participants of nucleus @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the average number of inelastic collisions in @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the average total number of collisions suffered by each nucleon .",
    "the first term in ( [ 4e ] ) is the plateau height in a @xmath14 collision , resulting from the superposition of @xmath16 strings , multiplied by @xmath17 . since in dpm",
    "there are two strings per inelastic collision , the second term , consisting of strings stretched between sea quarks and antiquarks , makes up a total number of strings equal to @xmath18 .",
    "the hadronic multiplicities of the strings in ( [ 4e ] ) are obtained from a convolution of momentum distribution function and fragmentation functions ( eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) to ( 3.4 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the former are given @xcite by a product of regge propagators times a delta function of energy conservation :      here @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the @xmath22values of the valence quark and diquark , respectively , @xmath23 those of the sea quarks and antiquarks and @xmath24 is obtained by normalizing @xmath25 to unity . the momentum distribution of a single constituent is obtained by integrating ( [ 7e ] ) over the @xmath26 s of all others . in order to regularize the singularities at @xmath27 all @xmath26 ( @xmath28 ) in eq .",
    "( [ 7e ] ) are replaced by @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 = 0.1 gev@xmath31 .",
    "this introduces a free parameter @xmath32 in the model .",
    "the diquarks and quark fragmentation functions into charged particles were determined from @xmath33 and/or @xmath14 data .",
    "they are given by @xcite      finally , we have taken for the threshold of @xmath35 strings @xmath36 and for the one of @xmath37 strings @xmath38 , with @xmath39 = 0.33 gev .",
    "the value of @xmath13 can be determined in a generalized eikonal model .",
    "alternatively , we can fix it in such a way that the plateau in @xmath14 agrees with the experimental value of @xmath40 for non - diffractive events .",
    "these two determinations are consistent with each other @xcite .        already at rhic energies , where @xmath42 is substantially smaller than @xmath43 ,",
    "the last term of ( [ 4e ] ) turns out to dominate .",
    "however , energy conservation constraints produce a decrease of @xmath44 with increasing centrality and , thus , the scaling in the number of binary collisions is not reached .",
    "since the @xmath14 rapidity plateau @xmath45 refers to non - diffractive events , for consistency we have to use also the non - diffractive cross - section @xmath46 ( rather than the inelastic one ) in the determination of @xmath17 and @xmath2 , in order to recover eq .",
    "( [ 9e ] ) asymptotically . in this case",
    "one should also use the @xmath14 multiplicity for inelastic events . since the latter is about 10 % smaller than the non - diffractive one @xcite",
    ", the two effects tend to compensate with each other and only a small difference remains in the calculated multiplicities . ] .",
    "we can now compute the centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities .",
    "we present first the results obtained in the absence of shadowing , at three different energies  : @xmath47 , 130 and 200 gev .",
    "the corresponding non - diffractive cross - sections are @xcite @xmath48 , 33 and 34 mb , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath49 , 2.0 and 2.2 , corresponding to @xmath50 , 2.72 and 3.04 @xcite .",
    "the values of the charged multiplicities @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the individual strings calculated in dpm , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  1 ( solid line ) and in figs .  2 - 3 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "at sps we obtain a mild increase of the multiplicity per participant consistent with the results of the wa98 collaboration @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) . this increase gets stronger with increasing energies ( figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the absolute value of the multiplicity at sps energies determined in dpm has some uncertainty .",
    "first , the excess of @xmath53 and @xmath54 over @xmath55 and @xmath56 is not properly taken into account in the above calculation .",
    "second , the value of the multiplicity in the @xmath57 strings is affected by the value of its threshold .",
    "the latter has much less effect at @xmath58 and 200 gev . however , shadowing corrections , which are negligibly small at sps energies , become important at rhic and have to be taken into account .",
    "this introduces some uncertainty at rhic energies ( see below ) .    as emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "shadowing corrections in gribov theory are universal , i.e. they apply both to soft and hard processes .",
    "they are closely related to the size of diffractive production and , thus , are controlled by triple pomeron diagrams @xcite . in the recent papers @xcite it was shown , that , when unitarity corrections are consistently taken into account , one can describe hard diffraction at hera and soft one ( photoproduction ) with the same value of the triple pomeron coupling .",
    "this value agrees with the one in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be used in the following calculation .",
    "the reduction of the multiplicity resulting from shadowing corrections is given by the ratio @xcite              with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the squared mass of the diffractive system .",
    "for a particle produced at @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . using the parameters of @xcite @xcite we get  :",
    "@xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "the values of the shadowing corrections at each impact parameter @xmath69 in @xmath70-@xmath70 collisions at @xmath58  gev are shown in table 1 .",
    "our results including shadowing are shown by the upper lines of the dark bands in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "it should be stressed that our calculations refer to @xmath71 while the first rhic measurements @xcite @xcite refer to @xmath72 .",
    "the latter is , of course , smaller at mid rapidities .",
    "this difference is negligibly small as sps where the laboratory pseudo - rapidity variable is used .",
    "however , at @xmath58 and 200 gev , where @xmath73 is used instead , their ratio is as large as 1.3 @xcite with centrality is predicted to be rather small at rhic @xcite .",
    "thus , we have used the same 1.3 reduction factor for all centralities . ] .",
    "this value is substantially larger than the value of 1.1 quoted in @xcite .",
    "our results for the centrality dependence of @xmath72 per participant at @xmath58  gev are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( upper line of the dark band ) and compared with the phenix data . as we see ,",
    "the centrality dependence is quite well reproduced .",
    "however , the absolute values are about 15 % higher than the data .",
    "it should be stressed that the values of @xmath74 , eq . ( [ 10e ] ) are quite large ( see table 2 ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite they have a rather large uncertainty at rhic energies .",
    "an alternative calculation of @xmath74 in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a formalism that reproduces the nuclear effects in dis on nuclei , led to values of shadowing about 15  % larger than the ones obtained here .",
    "clearly , with these larger values of the shadowing corrections we would obtain a quantitative agreement with the phenix data .",
    "multiplying the values of @xmath75 in table 2 by a factor 0.85 we obtain the lower lines of the dark bands in figs .  2 - 4 .",
    "these bands can be regarded as an estimate of the uncertainties on the values of the calculated multiplicities due to uncertainties in the shadowing corrections .",
    "note that these uncertainties affect mostly the absolute values of the multiplicities  while their centrality dependence is determined quite unambigously within our model .",
    "the multiplicity per participant at sps energies increases by 1.15 between @xmath76  fm and @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding increase at @xmath58  gev and 200 gev is 1.30 and 1.31 , respectively . as a consequence of this saturation ,",
    "the rise of the central plateau in @xmath70-@xmath70 collisions between these two energies is close to the one in @xmath14 collisions  an interesting prediction of our model .",
    "we would like to compare our results with the ones obtained in other approaches .",
    "many monte carlos based on or inspired by dpm or qgsm do contain a term proportional to the number of binary collisions .",
    "however , in other approaches @xcite such a term is associated with minijets . of course",
    "minijets are produced at high energies .",
    "they have been incorporated in dpm and modify the @xmath78 dependence of the model @xcite .",
    "however , they do not affect the multiplicities , since they play the same role as @xmath79-@xmath80 strings and the total number of such strings is controlled by unitarity .",
    "a comparison with @xcite shows that , while in this approach the multiplicity is given by a linear combination of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with coefficients independent of @xmath83 , in our case these coefficients decrease with increasing centrality .",
    "more important , in our approach these coefficients are calculated while in @xcite they are fitted to the data at each energy .",
    "an interesting estimate of the centrality dependence of charged multiplicities in high density qcd @xcite has been presented in @xcite .",
    "surprisingly the result at @xmath58  gev is almost identical to the one based on the minijet picture obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , this result relys entirely on the logarithmic dependence of the gluon structure function of the nucleon on the saturation scale @xmath84 , used in @xcite ( see last paper of ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on this point ) .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the centrality dependence of the multiplicity per participant in the minijet model @xcite gets stronger with increasing energy  due to an increase of the minijet fraction . on the contrary , in high density qcd",
    "the effect is the opposite one , namely , the ( partonic ) multiplicity per participant depends less and less on centrality when energy increases in @xmath85 , which depends strongly on centrality , is independent of energy , while the factor @xmath86 , which depends on impact parameter very mildly , increases with @xmath87 .",
    "therefore @xmath88 $ ] at very high energies . ] .",
    "this is an interesting prediction of the high density qcd saturation model .",
    "however , in the rhic energy range , from @xmath58 to 200  gev , this effect is negligeably small and the centrality dependence of the multiplicity per participant is the same at these two energies .",
    "interestingly , the same result is obtained in dpm when shadowing corrections are taken into account .",
