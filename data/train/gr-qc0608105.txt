    "up to now the lense - thirring effect@xcite has been only tested in the terrestrial gravitational field with the lageos satellites@xcite .",
    "although the relativistic predictions are not in disagreement with the results of such tests , their realistic accuracy has always been controversial@xcite .",
    "recent advances in planetary ephemerides@xmath2 have made meaningful to compare the relativistic predictions for the lense - thirring effect of the sun on the inner planets of the solar system@xcite to the least - squares determined extra - rates of perihelion of such celestial bodies@xmath2 .",
    "there is no contradiction between them ; although the errors are still large so that also a zero - effect can not be ruled out , the hypothesis of the existence of the solar gravitomagnetic field is in better agreement with the data@xmath3 . in april 2004",
    "the gp - b spacecraft@xcite has been launched to measure the schiff precession@xmath4 of the spins of four superconducting gyroscopes carried onboard : the expected accuracy is @xmath5 .",
    "the space environment of mars has recently yielded the opportunity of performing another test@xmath6 of the lense - thirring effect .",
    "almost six years of range and range  rate data of the mars global surveyor ( mgs ) orbiter , together with three years of data from odyssey , have been used in order to precisely determine many global properties of mars@xmath7 . as a by - product ,",
    "also the orbit of mgs has been very accurately reconstructed@xmath7 .",
    "the average of the rms overlap differences of the out - of - plane part of the mgs orbit amounts to 1.613 m over an about 5-years time span ( 14 november 199914 january 2005 ) .",
    "neither the gravitomagnetic force was included in the dynamical models used in the data reduction , nor any empirical out - of - plane acceleration was fitted , so that the rms overlap differences entirely account for the martian gravitomagnetic force .",
    "the average out - of - plane mgs lense - thirring shift over the same time span amounts just to 1.610 m : a discrepancy of @xmath8 .",
    "the error has been evaluated as@xmath6 @xmath9 .",
    "let us , finally , note that the mgs test is based on a data analysis done in a completely independent way with respect to the author of ref .",
    "@xmath10 , without having gravitomagnetism in mind at all .",
    "the pioneer anomaly@xcite is an unexpected , almost constant and uniform extra - acceleration @xmath11 directed towards the sun of @xmath12 m s@xmath13 detected in the data of both the pioneer 10/11 probes after 20 au .",
    "it has attracted much interest because of the possibility that it is a signal of some failure in the currently known laws of gravitation@xmath14 . if the pioneer anomaly was of gravitational origin , it should then fulfil the equivalence principle and an extra - gravitational acceleration like @xmath11 should also affect the motion of any other object moving in the region in which the pioneer anomaly manifested itself .",
    "uranus , neptune and pluto are ideal candidates to perform independent and clean tests of the hypothesis that the pioneer anomaly is due to some still unexplained features of gravity .",
    "indeed , their paths lie at the edge of the pioneer anomaly region or entirely reside in it because their semimajor axes are 19.19 au , 30.06 au , and 39.48 au , respectively , and their eccentricities amount to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . under the action of @xmath18 ,",
    "whatever physical mechanism may cause it , their perihelia would secularly precess at unexpectedly large rates . for uranus , which is the only outer planet having",
    "completed a full orbital revolution over the time span for which modern observations are available , the anomalous perihelion rate is @xmath19 arcseconds per century .",
    "pitjeva in processing almost one century of data with the epm2004 ephemerides@xmath20 also determined extra - rates of the perihelia of the inner@xmath2 and outer@xmath21 planets as fit - for parameters of global solutions in which she contrasted , in a least - square way , the observations to their predicted values computed with a complete suite of dynamical force models including all the known features of motion .",
    "thus , any unmodelled force as @xmath11 is entirely accounted for by the perihelia extra - rates .",
    "for the perihelion of uranus she preliminarily determined an extra - rate of @xmath22 arcseconds per century .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is just the mere formal , statistical error : the realistic one might be up to @xmath23 times larger .",
    "even if it was 50 times larger , the presence of an unexpected precession as large as that predicted for uranus would be ruled out .",
    "it is unlikely that such a conclusion will be substantially changed when further and extensive re - analysis@xmath24 of the entire pioneer 10/11 data set will be carried out since they will be focussed on what happened well before 20 au .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "@xmath25 in which the time - dependent patterns of @xmath26 and @xmath27 induced by a pioneer - like acceleration on uranus , neptune and pluto have been compared with the observational residuals determined by pitjeva@xmath20 for the same quantities and the same planets over a time span of about 90 years from 1913 ( 1914 for pluto ) to 2003 .",
    "while the former ones exhibited well defined polynomial signatures of hundreds of arcseconds , the residuals did not show any particular patterns , being almost uniform strips constrained well within @xmath28 arcseconds over the data set time span which includes the entire pioneer 10/11 lifetimes",
