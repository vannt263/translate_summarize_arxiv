    "exactly solved models are special , important and relatively rare in physics . in many cases",
    "real life phenomena are modelled by simplified solvable models , which despite the simplifications can give us great insight into the behaviour of the more complicated fully - fledged problem .",
    "a well - known long standing problem in statistical mechanics is to find the perimeter generating function for self - avoiding polygons on a regular two - dimensional lattice .",
    "several simplifications of this problem are solvable @xcite , but all the simpler models impose an effective directedness or other constraint that reduces the problem , in essence , to a one - dimensional problem .",
    "a very important and interesting insight gained from these simple models ( staircase polygons in particular ) is the conjecture for the limit distribution of area moments and scaling function for self - avoiding polygons @xcite .",
    "here we report on the discovery of the exact perimeter generating function for a model of punctured staircase polygons .",
    "this solution was first conjectured on the basis of series analysis ( see sections  3 and  4 ) and subsequently proved using combinatorial arguments ( section  5 ) .",
    "the combinatorial construction admits many generalisations including to models with other types of punctures and to a model with any fixed number of nested rotated staircase punctures ( section  6 ) .",
    "a staircase polygon can be viewed as the intersection of two directed walks starting at the origin , moving only to the right or up and terminating once the walks join at a vertex .",
    "the perimeter length of a staircase polygon is even .",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 the number of staircase polygons of perimeter @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath2 are given by the catalan numbers @xmath3 and that the associated half - perimeter generating function is @xmath4 where the connective constant @xmath5 and the critical exponent @xmath6 . from this",
    "it readily follows that @xmath0 grows asymptotically as @xmath7 , where the critical amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "punctured staircase polygons @xcite are staircase polygons with internal holes which are also staircase polygons ( the polygons and holes are mutually- as well as self - avoiding ) . in a recent paper @xcite we studied the problem of staircase polygons with a single hole and found that the perimeter generating function can be expressed as the solution of an 8th order linear ode . here",
    "we will study the case with a _",
    "hole but where the internal polygon is rotated by 90  with respect to the main axis .",
    "so the internal staircase polygon is the intersection of two walks starting at a vertex ( the top left - most vertex of the internal polygon ) and taking steps only to the right and _",
    "down_. we will refer to these objects as rotated punctured staircase polygons . in figure  [",
    "fig : poly ] we have shown an example of each of the two types of punctured polygons . the perimeter length of a punctured polygon is the sum of the outer perimeter and the perimeter of the hole .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the number of punctured staircase polygons of perimeter @xmath1 and by @xmath10 the number of rotated punctured staircase polygons of perimeter @xmath1 .",
    "the associated generating functions are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the left panel shows a typical punctured staircase polygon and the right panel a rotated punctured staircase polygon .",
    ", width=453 ]    it is intuitively clear that since staircase polygons are elongated along the diagonal of growth there are many more restrictions on the placement of the rotated polygon and hence we expect @xmath13 .",
    "the difference between the two cases can be made more explicit by noting that any polygon has a _",
    "minimal bounding rectangle _ which is the smallest rectangle completely containing the polygon . in the rotated case",
    "the outer polygon is excluded from the minimal bounding rectangle of the hole while in the aligned case the outer polygon may enter the minimal bounding rectangle of the hole ( as is the case in the left panel of figure  [ fig : poly ] ) .",
    "in @xcite it was proved that the connective constant @xmath14 of @xmath15-punctured polygons ( polygons with @xmath15 holes ) is the same as the connective constant of unpunctured polygons .",
    "numerical evidence clearly indicated that the critical exponent @xmath16 increased by @xmath17 per puncture ( this was proved for a single puncture and conjectured in the general case ) . in recent work richard ,",
    "jensen and guttmann ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) proved the exponent formula for a finite number of punctures and proved an exact formula for the leading amplitude of punctured staircase polygons .",
    "it it worth noting that the proofs in these papers never considered restrictions on the placement of the internal polygon , that is , the hole could be placed in any way one pleases .",
    "the results , therefore , carry over unaltered to the problem of rotated punctured staircase polygons .",
    "interestingly , this means that the leading asymptotic forms of @xmath10 and @xmath9 are exactly the same ; any differences arise only from sub - dominant correction terms .",
    "in particular the dominant singular behaviour of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a simple pole at @xmath20 and thus @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where we expect that @xmath23",
    ".    the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : enum ] we briefly describe the algorithm used to count the number of punctured polygons .",
    "section  [ sec : fde ] describes how we found the underlying ode and gives a brief review of its critical properties .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : sol ] , we give the closed form solution for the generating function .",
    "section  [ sec : comb ] contains an outline of the rigorous combinatorial derivation of the generating function while section  [ sec : gen ] contains a brief outline of results obtained by generalising the combinatorial formula .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] we briefly discuss our findings .",
    "rotated punctured staircase polygons were counted using a generic algorithm designed to count punctured convex polygons , which in turn was based on an algorithm for counting general self - avoiding polygons @xcite , but with restrictions so as to limit the count to various types of convex polygons .",
    "a polygon is convex if the perimeter is equal to that of its minimal bounding rectangle ( the smallest rectangle into which one can fit the polygon ) .",
    "a staircase polygon is a restricted convex polygon and is produced by demanding that two diagonally opposite corners of the minimal bounding rectangle are part of the convex polygon .",
    "a standard punctured staircase polygon is then produced by demanding that the outer and inner polygons must include , say , the lower left and upper right corners of their respective minimal bounding rectangles .",
    "for rotated punctured staircase polygons the inner polygon must include the upper left and lower right corners as illustrated in figure  [ fig : poly ] .",

    "we used their method to find linear odes for the perimeter generating functions of punctured staircase polygons and three - choice polygons .",
    "we have used this technique to find a linear ode satisfied by the generating function @xmath19 for rotated punctured staircase polygons .",
    "we briefly outline the method here . starting from a ( long ) series expansion for a function",
    "@xmath32 we look for a linear differential equation of order @xmath33 of the form    @xmath34    such that @xmath35 is a solution to this homogeneous linear differential equation , where the @xmath36 are polynomials . in order to make it as simple as possible we start by searching for a fuchsian @xcite equation .",
    "such equations have only regular singular points .",
    "computationally the fuchsian assumption simplifies the search for a solution . from the general theory of fuchsian @xcite equations",
    "it follows that the degree of @xmath36 is at most @xmath37 where @xmath24 is the degree of @xmath38 . to simplify matters",
    "further ( reduce the order of the unknown polynomials ) it is advantageous to explicitly assume that the origin and @xmath20 are regular singular points and to set @xmath39 , where @xmath40",
    ". thus when searching for a solution of fuchsian type there are only two parameters , namely the order @xmath33 of the differential equation and the degree @xmath41 of the polynomial @xmath42 .",
    "since the degree of the imposed factor @xmath43 is 2 the restriction on the degree of @xmath36 means that the degree of @xmath44 is at most @xmath45 .",
    "the number of unknown coefficients is thus @xmath46 , where we get one less unknown by demanding that the leading coefficient in @xmath42 is  1 .",
    "we then search systematically for solutions by varying @xmath33 and @xmath41 . in this way we found a solution with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which required the determination of only @xmath49 unknown coefficients .",
    "we have 118 non - zero terms in the half - perimeter series and thus have 84 additional terms with which to check the correctness of our solution .",
    "this should be contrasted with punctured staircase polygons @xcite where we first found a solution with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which required the determination of @xmath52 unknown coefficients .",
    "the lowest order ode we found had order @xmath53 with @xmath54 , which requires the determination of @xmath55 unknown coefficients .",
    "so clearly the restrictions imposed by the rotation of the internal polygon results in a much simpler problem ( _ a priori _ there was obviously no reason to believe this would be the case ) .",
    "the ( half)-perimeter generating function @xmath19 for rotated punctured staircase polygons is a solution to the linear differential equation of order 4    @xmath56    with    @xmath57    the singular points of the differential equation are given by the roots of @xmath58 .",
    "one can easily check that all the singularities ( including @xmath59 ) are _ regular singular points _",
    "so equation  ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) is indeed of the fuchsian type .",
    "it is thus possible using the method of frobenius to obtain from the indicial equation the critical exponents at the singular points .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : ppexp ] .",

    "however , we have found in the analysis of previous problems that for the fuchsian equations of the type described by equation  ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) _ only _ multiple roots of the indicial equation give rise to logarithmic terms in the local solution around a given singularity , so that a root of multiplicity @xmath15 gives rise to logarithmic terms up to @xmath82 .",
    "in particular this means that near any of the 3 roots of @xmath83 , the local solutions have no logarithmic terms and the solutions are thus _ analytic _ since all the exponents are positive integers .",
    "the roots of @xmath84 are thus _ apparent singularities _ @xcite of the fuchsian equation  ( [ eq : ppfde ] ) .",
    "this will become completely self - evident in the next section where we present a closed form solution of @xmath19 .",
    "so the points of interest are the physical critical point @xmath20 , where the dominant singularity is a simple pole , modified by 3 correction terms with exponents that increase in steps of @xmath85 . at the non - physical critical point @xmath70",
    "the function has a simple square root singularity .",
    "given an ode it is often useful to look for simple solutions . in this case",
    "we first looked for solutions of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a polynomial and @xmath88 or @xmath85 . in this fashion we discovered the solutions @xmath89 and @xmath90 listed below .",
    "this gave us great hope that we could find a solution to the full problem since the two simple solutions can be used to write the ode as a product of three differential operators of order 2 , 1 and 1 , respectively . as it turned out",
    "the dsolve package in maple was up to the task and readily found four solutions , including @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the remaining two solutions as supplied by dsolve were quite complicated expressions , but with a bit of work we managed to simplify ( largely by hand ) to the expressions @xmath91 and @xmath92 given below .",

    "before we consider the construction , it is important to note is that because the inner polygon ( the hole ) is rotated @xmath97 from the outer polygon , it follows that the outer polygon must avoid not only the inner polygon , but also its minimal bounding rectangle .",
    "this considerably simplifies the problem .",
    "the four stages in the combinatorial construction of a rotated staircase polygon .",
    "we start ( a ) from a staircase polygon sitting in it s minimal bounding rectangle .",
    "next ( b ) we attach directed walks above and below the rectangle and ( c ) connect the walks to form an outer polygon .",
    "finally ( d ) we complete the construction by attaching staircase factors on the left and right sides of the outer polygon .",
    ", width=453 ]    we build the punctured polygon in four steps ( see figure  [ fig : cons ] ) .    1 .",
    "construct the inner polygon , enumerating it by total perimeter , width and height . a wasp - waist decomposition or a column - by - column construction gives the following generating function @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 are conjugate to the number of horizontal and vertical bonds and @xmath100 are conjugate to the width and height of the associated minimum bounding rectangle .",
    "we then attach two directed paths to the bounding rectangle of the polygon ; one above and one below .",
    "if the polygon has width @xmath101 , then each of these paths must start and end with a horizontal bond , contain a total of @xmath102 horizontal bonds .",
    "the generating function of a directed path is @xmath103 hence the generating function of directed walks with exactly @xmath101 horizontal bonds is @xmath104 .",
    "so if we wish to attach a directed path of width @xmath102 above a staircase polygon of width @xmath101 , then the corresponding generating function is @xmath105 .",
    "if we attach two directed paths ( one above and one below ) we obtain @xmath106 . +",
    "next we have to insert a ( positive ) number of rows between the directed paths and the bounding rectangle .",
    "we also need to keep track of some extra variables .",
    "in particular we need to know the height of the leftmost and rightmost columns ( the distances between the end - points of the directed walks ) .",
    "let these be counted by the variables @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "+ inserting a positive number of rows between the directed paths and the bounding rectangle is equivalent to multiplying by @xmath109 . since each directed path adds to either the height of the leftmost or rightmost column we need to modify what we did above . in particular the generating function of the upper directed path",
    "becomes @xmath110 and that of the lower path becomes @xmath111 .",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the generating function of open configurations as drawn in figure  [ fig : cons](b ) .",
    "3 .   i the next step we simply add vertical bonds to each of the open ends thus connecting the directed paths so as to form a closed object .",
    "this corresponds to mapping @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "hence our generating function is @xmath116 which counts the closed configurations as drawn in figure  [ fig : cons](c ) .",
    "the punctured staircase polygons are completed by adding left and right staircase polygon factors to each side . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is done by substituting @xmath117 and @xmath118 where @xmath119 is very nearly the staircase polygon generating function .",
    "+ more specifically we do a temperley / bousquet - mlou - like column - by - column construction to obtain the appropriate generating function . in",
    "@xcite the functional equation used to enumerate staircase polygons by perimeter and area is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the `` _ _ seed _ _ '' configuration to which we append columns and @xmath122 is the generating function of the resulting staircase polygons . +",
    "this functional equation can be solved using the kernel method .",
    "first take all the @xmath122 terms to the left - hand side of the equation : @xmath123 now set @xmath107 to a value that takes the coefficient of @xmath122 ( the kernel ) to be zero .",
    "this value is @xmath124 which is very nearly the staircase polygon generating function .",
    "setting @xmath107 to this value leaves @xmath125 where we have made use of the fact that @xmath126 .",
    "we do not care about @xmath122 and only want @xmath127 ( _ i.e. _ we do not need to know the leftmost and rightmost column heights of our punctured polygons ) and we are done .    the generating function of staircase polygons with a rotated staircase hole is given by @xmath128 of course , the punctured polygons always have an even number of horizontal and vertical bonds , so we can replace @xmath129 and @xmath130 to obtain the half - perimeter generating function : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the solution of @xmath133 and @xmath119 is the solution of @xmath134 .",
    "one may verify that setting @xmath135 does indeed recover the generating function given in equation  ( [ eqn ode sol ] )",
    "here we shall consider three generalisations of the combinatorial result . in the first generalisation we look at the case where we do not count the perimeter of the hole ( in other words the perimeter of the punctured polygon is equal to the perimeter of the external polygon only ) . in the second generalisation",
    "we look at what happens if we replace the internal polygon by a convex polygon of a different type . in the third generalisation",
    "we show that the formula  ( [ eq : cfinal ] ) can be used to derive the generating function for nested staircase polygons .    the first generalisation is simply obtained by noting that in formula  ( [ eq : cfinal ] ) the variables @xmath136 and @xmath137 ` counting ' the perimeter can be separated in order to count the external and internal perimeter . in fact going back through the derivation we note that in equation  ( [ eq : cfinal ] ) only the last ( right - most ) occurrence of @xmath136 and @xmath137 come from the internal polygon ( all the other occurrences arise from the outer polygon ) .",
    "we thus find that the generating function for rotated punctured staircase polygons counted only by _",
    "perimeter is @xmath138 analysis of this solution shows that again it is the solution to a 4th order ode and there is a major change in the critical behaviour .",
    "the function now has a square root singularity at @xmath139 , that is a behaviour @xmath140 , so the connective constant changes from 4 to 25/4 .",
    "there is still a singularity at @xmath65 , and interestingly the behaviour around it is quite complicated with exponents @xmath66 , @xmath68 , 0 and 1/2 .",
    "the second generalisation is obtained by noting that in the derivation of formula  ( [ eq : cfinal ] ) we never really used the fact that the internal polygon was a staircase polygon we only relied on the fact that the external polygon is excluded from the minimal bounding rectangle of the hole .",
    "this means that we can replace @xmath141 with the generating function of another type of polygon provided we know how to enumerate them by width , height and perimeter . in table  [ tab : crit ] we summarise the results for the critical behaviour at the leading singularity when the puncture is a convex polygon .",
    "firstly we note that the dominant singularity remains at @xmath65 . however , the critical exponent changes depending on the asymptotic growth of the generating function of the puncture .",
    "when the asymptotic growth of the puncture is slower than or equal to that of staircase polygons we have a simple pole at @xmath65 .",
    "however , in the case of directed convex and the case of convex polygons ( both of which are asymptotically more numerous than staircase polygons ) the critical exponent changes to reflect a faster growth in the number of the associated punctured polygons .",

    "this gives us ( at least in principle ) solutions for any fixed number of staircase polygons nested within one another .",
    "where at each level the outer polygon avoids the minimal bounding rectangle of the inner polygon(s ) . in order to prove the iteration procedure we note the following facts :    1 .",
    "as already noted above the @xmath136 and @xmath137 variables can easily be distinguished so as to count the outer and inner perimeters separately .",
    "2 .   we do nt really need to keep track of the internal perimeter in detail .",
    "because of the convexity constraint the @xmath150-variables from the outer polygon automatically counts the width and height so the @xmath101 and @xmath151 variables in the original @xmath132 are not really needed .",
    "we have no restriction on what we put inside the hole .",
    "in particular we could put a staircase polygon with a rotated staircase polygon into the hole .    with this in mind we can see formula  ( [ eq : cfinal ] ) as an operator on generating functions along the lines of  wrap me in a staircase polygons but do nt enter my minimal bounding rectangle \" ,    @xmath152 \\mapsto   b(x , y)p(xz/(1\\!-\\!\\sigma y)^2,\\sigma^2 yz),\\ ] ]    where @xmath153 is the prefactor @xmath154 . by iteration",

    "in reality the solutions are pretty nasty and so far we have determined mainly the leading asymptotic behaviour . in summary we find that the generating functions @xmath157 have a singularity at @xmath158 with leading exponent @xmath159 . we have confirmed the exponent value for @xmath15 up to 10 by doing formal expansions around @xmath158 .",
    "it appears that the singularity is of order @xmath160 and that the full set of exponents is given by @xmath161 , @xmath162 .",
    "we have already seen that this behaviour is true for @xmath163 from the closed formed solution .",
    "for @xmath164 we took the formula for @xmath165 and expanded in a series to order 1000 . using the method described in section  [ sec : fde ] we managed to find the exact ode which is of order 8 as expected with degree of the leading polynomial equal to 66 . solving",

    "using series expansions for rotated punctured staircase polygons we found that the half - perimeter generating function @xmath19 satisfies a fourth order fuchsian ode .",
    "we then solved this ode and found a closed form solution for @xmath19 .",
    "the solution is dominated by a function @xmath174 with a simple root at @xmath20 .",
    "there are three sub - dominant correction terms @xmath175 which has critical exponent @xmath67 , @xmath176 with exponent @xmath68 and @xmath177 with exponent @xmath69 .",
    "in addition there is a square root singularity at @xmath70 .",
    "this should be compared to our analysis @xcite of the ode satisfied by the generating function @xmath18 for punctured staircase polygons , which showed that near the physical critical point @xmath20 @xmath178 where @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 are analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath142 .",
    "in addition @xmath18 has a singularity on the negative @xmath136-axis , at @xmath182 with the singular behaviour @xmath183 where again @xmath184 is analytic near @xmath185 .",
    "finally , the ode also had a pair of singularities at @xmath186 and at the roots of @xmath187 ( see @xcite for further details ) , but since these singularities lie in the complex plane outside the physical disc @xmath188 their contributions are exponentially suppressed asymptotically .",
    "we argued in the introduction and demonstrated in section  [ sec : sol ] that @xmath9 and @xmath10 have exactly the same asymptotic form to leading order .",
    "any differences between the two problems only appear in the sub - dominant correction terms .",
    "the dominant correction term for @xmath18 is @xmath189 , which is weaker than the first correction term @xmath190 for @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitudes of both these correction terms are negative , namely , @xmath191 and @xmath192_{x = x_c}/\\gamma(3/4 ) =   -1/\\left ( 16\\sqrt{2}\\gamma(3/4)\\right ) \\approx -0.036 $ ] , respectively .",
    "so this bears out our intuition that @xmath13 , since the placement of a rotated inner staircase polygon faces more restrictions than the placement of aligned inner and outer staircase polygons .",
    "these differences indicate that combinatorial arguments for a proof of sub - dominant behaviour must be quite subtle !",
    "the combinatorial derivation of the expression for @xmath19 turned out to be very interesting .",
    "in particular it allowed us to prove exact results for several generalisations of the original model . in the case where we only count the external perimeter",
    "we find a change in the value of dominant singularity to @xmath193 .",
    "there is still a singularity at @xmath65 and interestingly the behaviour at this ( now sub - dominant ) critical point is much more complicated than at the leading singularity .",
    "we also studied the case where the puncture was replaced by a different type of convex polygon ( with the external staircase polygon avoiding its minimal bounding rectangle ) .",
    "the major finding of interest was that the dominant singularity remained at @xmath20 .",
    "however , the critical exponent changed depending on the asymptotic growth of the generating function of the puncture .",
    "when the asymptotic growth of the puncture is slower than or equal to that of staircase polygons we have a simple pole at @xmath20 .",
    "however , in the case of directed convex and the case of convex polygons ( both of which are asymptotically more numerous than staircase polygons ) the critical exponent changes to reflect a faster growth in the number of the associated punctured polygons",
    ". finally , we looked at the case of nested staircase polygons in which case we can derive formulas for a fixed number @xmath15 of nested staircase polygons .",
    "we found that the singularity remains at @xmath65 with a leading exponent @xmath159 ; while we have observed this for @xmath194 , we have not proved it .",
    "another interesting open question is the behaviour of staircase polygons with an arbitrary number of nested polygons ( that is the function formed by summing @xmath195 ) .",
    "this work can also be extended to different types of outer polygons .",
    "the method of section  [ sec : comb ] should generalise to other types of convex polygons .",

    "<S> we have derived the perimeter generating function of a model of punctured staircase polygons in which the internal staircase polygon is rotated by a 90  angle with respect to the outer staircase polygon . in one approach we calculated a long series expansion for the problem and found that all the terms in the generating function can be reproduced from a linear fuchsian differential equation of order 4 . </S>",
    "<S> we then solved this ode and found a closed form expression for the generating function . </S>",
    "<S> this is a highly unusual and most fortuitous result since odes of such high order very rarely permit a closed form solution . in a second approach we proved the result for the generating function exactly using combinatorial arguments </S>",
    "<S> this latter solution allows many generalisations including to models with other types of punctures and to a model with any fixed number of nested rotated staircase punctures . </S>"
