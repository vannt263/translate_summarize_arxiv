    "since the discovery of radio recombination lines ( rrls ) ( dravskikh & dravskikh 1964 ; sorochenko & borozich 1964 ; palmer et al . 1967 )",
    "these have been widely used as diagnostics of ionized media in the galaxy .",
    "theoretical studies of line formation have shown that the width of rrls depends sensitively on the principal quantum number ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 in hz ) and is also proportional to the electron density ( shaver 1975 ) .",
    "thus low - frequency ( @xmath12 a few ghz ) rrls from dense ionized regions ( @xmath13 a few times 10@xmath14 @xmath5 ) will be broadened , resulting in the reduction of the peak line intensity .",
    "this reduction in peak intensity makes it difficult to detect rrls at low frequencies from high density gas . on the other hand , low frequency rrls from low density ionized regions",
    "are not affected by this limitation .",
    "hence these rrls form an ideal probe to study lower density regions such as photodissociation regions , diffuse , extended hii regions ( e.g. lockman 1989 , lockman et al . 1996 ) , envelopes of hii regions and the extended low density warm ionized medium ( eldwim ) ( roshi & anantharamaiah 2001 , anantharamaiah 1985 , heiles et al .",
    "typically such regions have densities @xmath15 @xmath5 and emission measures @xmath16 pc  @xmath17 .    in this paper , we present giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and very large array ( vla ) observations of the hii region complex near @xmath18 and @xmath1 in rrls and radio continuum at frequencies of 0.61 , 1.28 and 1.42 ghz .",
    "this region consists of hii regions in various evolutionary stages , ranging from protostellar stage showing bipolar outflows detected in co ( furuya et al .",
    "2002 ) to the diffuse , extended hii region like g24.83 + 0.10 .",
    "the primary objective of these observations were to image and determine the physical properties of the diffuse hii region from which low frequency hydrogen and carbon rrls near 327 mhz have been observed ( anantharamaiah 1985 ) .",
    "the details of the observations are given in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the radio continuum morphology and physical properties of the diffuse hii regions derived from the continuum are described in section  [ sec : cont ] . in section  [ sec : rrl ] , we present the rrl data .",
    "we end with a summary of the results .",
    "a near kinematic distance of 6 kpc was determined for g24.83 + 0.10 and is used in this paper .",
    "table  [ tab0 ] gives the details of the observation .",
    "the 0.61 and 1.28 ghz observations were carried out with the gmrt and the 1.42 ghz observations were carried out with the vla .",
    ".observation details [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath19@xmath20 integrated over @xmath21 ; @xmath14@xmath20 integrated over @xmath22 ; + @xmath23@xmath20 integrated over @xmath24",
    ". + a.@xmath20 present work ; @xmath25 b.@xmath20 lockman ( 1989 ) + c.@xmath20 downes et al .",
    "( 1980 ) ; @xmath25 d.@xmath20 anantharamaiah ( 1985 ) + [ tab4 ]    the integrated line intensity map of the h@xmath26 emission ( in grey ) is shown in fig [ fig9a ] along with the radio continuum ( in contours ) at 1.42 ghz .",
    "line emission from g24.83 + 0.10 follows the continuum morphology .",
    "strongest line emission is observed near the compact objects g24.80 + 0.10 and and g24.85 + 0.09 .",
    "line emission is also observed from the diffuse source ( see fig [ fig9a ] ) .",
    "the line emission arising in g24.83 + 0.10 is observed at velocities ranging from @xmath27 to 110 kms@xmath9 .",
    "no systematic gradient in the velocity is observed .",
    "higher velocities @xmath28 kms@xmath9 are observed for the rrl arising near the uchii g24.80 + 0.09 . from their high resolution co observations ,",
    "furuya et al . (",
    "2002 ) find that the lsr velocity of the molecular cloud is about 111 kms@xmath9 with velocity in the outflow ranging from 90 to 130 kms@xmath9 .",
    "thus , the rrl we detect near this uchii region is likely related to this star forming region .",
    "interestingly , the lines appear to be narrow with widths at half maximum of @xmath29 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the narrow lines seem to arise close to the hii region g24.80 + 0.10 whereas the widest lines are observed near the uc hii region g24.85 + 0.09 .",
    "weak h rrl emission from diffuse hii regions g24.74 + 0.08 and g24.74 + 0.16 is also detected ( see fig [ fig9a ] ) at 102 kms@xmath9 and 106 kms@xmath9 respectively .",
    "( grey scale ) of the hii region g24.83 + 0.10 superposed on a contour map of the continuum emission from the region at 1.42 ghz .",
    "the image has a resolution of @xmath30 pa@xmath31 .",
    ", width=384 ]    due to the low signal - to - noise ratio for the h@xmath32 and h@xmath33 data , we were unable to obtain a detailed distribution of emission across g24.80 + 0.01 .",
    "thus , the integrated line flux densities of g24.83 + 0.10 at the three observed frequencies were used to model the line emission .",
    "the departure coefficients required in the models were calculated using the computer code of salem & brocklehurst ( 1979 ) , modified by walmsley & watson ( 1982 ) and payne , anantharamaiah and erickson ( 1994 ) .",
    "these were then used to calculate the expected line flux density at the different quantum numbers following shaver ( 1975 ) .    the best fitting model that we found had the following parameters , typical of a diffuse hii region : @xmath34 k and @xmath35 @xmath5 and a line of sight extent of 11 pc .",
    "the background radiation field for all the models was assumed to be a hii region with an emission measure of @xmath36 pc  @xmath17 .",
    "however we note that this model overpredicts the line flux near 0.61 ghz .",
    "detailed modelling of the observed rrls should include contribution from both the diffuse hii region and the compact hii regions observed embedded within the diffuse shell . with the signal to noise of the current data",
    ", such a detailed model is not warranted .",
    "high resolution sensitive low frequency rrl observations are required to model different regions of g24.80 + 0.10 independently .",
    "using the gmrt and vla , we have carried out low frequency interferometric continuum and recombination line observations of the hii regions near @xmath0 , @xmath1 at 0.61 ghz , 1.28 ghz and 1.42 ghz .",
    "we detect continuum emission from ultra - compact , compact and extended hii regions . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the morphology and average properties of the hii regions using our continuum observations .",
    "g24.83 + 0.10 , the main region under study in the paper , is diffuse and massive encompassing @xmath3 within a linear size of 7 pc with a rms electron density of @xmath27 @xmath5 .",
    "the source has a shell - like morphology with the shell opening to the n. two iras point sources are clearly associated with this hii region .",
    "compact hii regions are embedded in this diffuse region .",
    "we detected h@xmath32 , h@xmath33 and h@xmath26 lines from g24.83 + 0.10 .",
    "we also detected rrls from two other hii regions in the field near 100 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the model which provides the best fit to the source - integrated rrl data towards g24.83 + 0.1 has the following parameters : @xmath37 k , @xmath38 @xmath5 and path length of 11 pc .",
    "however this model overestimates the line strength at 0.61 ghz .",
    "we note that the electron density of the diffuse hii region that best fits the observed line data is similar to the rms electron density found from the continuum observations .",
    "more sensitive rrl observations of g24.83 + 0.10 are required to develop a detailed model of emission for this hii region .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for several useful comments which have especially helped improve the ir part of the paper .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt that made these observations possible .",
