    "the discovery of superconductivity in fe - pnictides and later in fe - chalcogenides opened up several new directions in the study of non - phononic mechanisms of electronic pairing in multi - band correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "two issues were brought about by recent angle - resolved photoemission and other experiments in fe - based superconductors ( fescs ) .",
    "first , in recent experiments on life@xmath16co@xmath17as , miao et al .",
    "observed@xcite a finite superconductive gap of @xmath18mev on the hole band , which is located below the fermi level , with the top of the band at 4 - 8mev away from @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the gap on this hole band is larger than the gaps on electron bands , which cross the fermi level .",
    "a similar observation has been reported for fete@xmath19se@xmath20 @xcite , where superconductivity with the gap @xmath21mev has been observed on an electron band which lies above the fermi level , with the bottom of the band at 0.7 mev away from @xmath0 .",
    "second , recent photoemission measurements have demonstrated that in almost all fe - based supperconductors either electron or hole pockets are more tiny than previously thought and the corresponding dispersions either barely cross the fermi level or are fully located below or above it  @xcite .",
    "the `` extreme '' case in this respect is fese . in this material fermi energies on",
    "_ all _ hole and electron pockets are small and are comparable to the magnitudes of the superconducting gaps ( the reported @xmath0 on different bands vary between 4 and 10 mev , while the gaps are 3 - 5mev  @xcite ) .",
    "the observation of a sizable superconducting gap on a band which does not cross the fermi level was originally interpreted  @xcite as the indication that the pairing in the fescs is a strong coupling phenomenon for which the pairing gap is not confined to the fermi surface and develops at all momenta in the brillouin zone .",
    "later , however , the experiments were re - interpreted  @xcite in a more conventional weak / moderate coupling scenario , as the consequence of the fact that in fsscs the pairing interaction primarily `` hopes '' a pair of fermions with momenta @xmath22 and @xmath23 from one band to the other  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the gap on the band , which does not cross the fermi level is determined by the density of states at @xmath0 of the band which does cross the fermi level .",
    "a solution of the coupled set of bcs gap equations for fermions in the two bands then shows that one crossing is sufficient to obtain bcs instability already at weak coupling@xcite .",
    "this reasoning also naturally explains why the gap is larger on a band which does not cross the fermi level .",
    "the observation of superconductivity with @xmath24 brought fescs into the orbit of long - standing discussion about the interplay between superconductivity and the formation of the bound pair of two fermions .",
    "this issue has been discussed in the condensed matter context  @xcite . and also for optical lattices of ultracold atoms .",
    "the phenomenon in which bound pairs of fermions form at a higher @xmath2 and condense at a smaller @xmath5 is often termed bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) because the condensation of preformed pairs ( i.e. , the development of a macroscopic condensate ) bears a direct analogy with bec of bosons in a bose gas .",
    "when @xmath25 and @xmath5 are much smaller than @xmath0 , bound pairs and true superconductivity develop at almost the same temperature , i.e. , @xmath26 . however , when @xmath0 gets smaller , superconducting @xmath5 is generally smaller than the onset temperature for bound state formation .     is the upper energy cutoff , @xmath0 is the fermi energy , and @xmath6 is the energy of a bound state of two fermions in a vacuum , i.e. , at @xmath27 . at weak coupling , @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is also small and can be tuned by doping to be either larger or smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "we show that in one - band model and in two band model with two hole or two electron bands , the system displays bcs - like behavior at @xmath7 and bec - like behavior at @xmath29 . in the latter case ,",
    "bound pais develop at @xmath30 but the true superconductivity with full phase coherence develops at @xmath13 . in between @xmath2 and @xmath5",
    "the system displays preformed pair behavior and the spectral function displays pseudogap behavior . in the two - band model with one hole and one electron pocket , @xmath2 and @xmath5 also split when @xmath0 gets smaller than @xmath6 , but both remain of order @xmath6 even when @xmath0 vanishes .",
    "still , superconducting @xmath5 in this limit is several times smaller than @xmath2 , so there is a wide temperature range of preformed pair behavior . ]    in the present communication , we discuss superconductivity vs bound state formation in 2d systems with weak attractive interaction @xmath31 in the proper symmetry channel .",
    "( @xmath32 for the two - band model for fescs ) .",
    "we consider the situation when @xmath31 remains energy independent up to an energy @xmath33 , which well exceeds @xmath0 , see fig.[fig0 ] .",
    "elementary quantum mechanics shows that in 2d , two fermions with dispersion @xmath34 form a bound state at arbitrary small attraction @xmath31 , and the bound state energy is @xmath1 , where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is a dimensionless coupling .",
    "we analyze the evolution of the system behavior and the interplay between @xmath5 and @xmath2 by varying the ratio @xmath37 while keeping both @xmath0 and @xmath6 well below @xmath33 .",
    "we briefly review bcs - bec crossover in the one - band two - dimensional ( 2d ) model and consider two different two - band models .    the first model , which we apply to fescs , consists of one hole and one electron band . we follow usual path and consider the case when the dominant pairing interaction is weak inter - band pair hopping interaction @xmath38 , in which case superconducting state",
    "has @xmath32 symmetry .",
    "we use the same computational procedure as in the studies of one - band model .",
    "@xcite namely , we first obtain the bound state energy @xmath1 for two fermions in a vacuum .",
    "then we consider the actual system with a non - zero density of carriers in one of the bands @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a 2d density of states at low energies , and solve the set of coupled equations for the chemical potential @xmath41 and the pairing gaps at a finite @xmath42 .",
    "the solution of the linearized gap equations yields the onset temperature of the pairing @xmath2 .",
    "the solution of non - linear gap equations at @xmath3 yields the pairing gaps @xmath43 .",
    "we next use the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath3 as inputs and compute superfluid stiffness @xmath4 . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the case when the chemical potential at @xmath3 _ in the would be normal state _ is at the bottom of the electron band but crosses the hole band i.e. , the fermi energy is zero for the electron band but finite for the hole band .",
    "we present the results in the two limits when @xmath0 is either larger or smaller than @xmath6 and in the case when @xmath45 .",
    "we show that in all cases the pairing gap develops on both bands and is larger on the electron band ( the one which does not cross the fermi level ) .",
    "this agrees qualitatively but not quantitatively with the results obtained previously within the conventional bcs theory  @xcite , neglecting the renormalization of the chemical potential .",
    "we argue , however , that the renormalization of the chemical potential by both a finite temperature and a finite gap is not a small perturbation when the bare chemical potential touches the bottom of the electron band .",
    "we argue that the onset temperature of the pairing , @xmath2 ( the one obtained by solving the set of equations for the pairing gaps and the chemical potentials ) evolves when @xmath37 changes and is of order @xmath46 when @xmath7 and of order @xmath6 when @xmath29 .",
    "we further ague that superconducting @xmath5 is of order @xmath2 for arbitrary @xmath37 , but is numerically smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "the numerical smallness implies that there exists a finite range of temperatures between @xmath2 and @xmath5 , where pairs are already formed but their phases are random and there is no superconductivity ( the `` preformed pairs '' regime ) .    the emergence of the bound pairs at @xmath47 and the existence of the preformed pairs regime is often associated with the crossover from bcs to bec behavior . such crossover has been studied in detail in the finite @xmath42 analysis of 3d one - band model ( ref .",
    "the temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath5 were found to differ strongly at @xmath29 : @xmath48 , while @xmath13 , i.e. , the ratio @xmath49 vanishes at @xmath50 .",
    "the behavior in the 2d case is quite similar ( see below ) . in our two - band model",
    "the behavior is similar to the one - band model in that @xmath2 becomes parametrically larger than @xmath0 at @xmath29 , but differs in that @xmath5 remains finite and of the same order as order @xmath2 even at @xmath50 .",
    "the reason , as we argue below , is that the development of the pairing gap below @xmath2 reconstructs the fermionic dispersion and creates images , with opposite dispersion , of original hole and electron bands .",
    "this in turn gives rise to the shift of fermionic density from the filled hole band and empty electron band into these image bands .",
    "as a consequence , there appear new hole - like and electron - like bands with a finite density of carriers in each band , proportional to @xmath2 . superconducting @xmath5 scales with this density and is a fraction of @xmath2 .",
    "we show that preformed pair behavior still exists at @xmath29 , but only because @xmath5 , set by superconducting stiffness , is numerically smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "we next consider the two - band model consisting of two electron bands .",
    "we again assume that the dominant pairing interaction is inter - band pair hopping @xmath51 and that the chemical potential is at or near the bottom of one of the bands , but crosses the dispersion of the other band at some finite @xmath0 .",
    "we show that , at @xmath7 , the behavior of this model is nearly identical to that in the model with a hole and an electron band .",
    "however , in the opposite limit @xmath52 , the behavior of the model with two electron bands differs qualitatively from that of the model with a hole and an electron band and is quite similar to the behavior of the 2d one - band model in the bec limit .",
    "namely , @xmath11 and @xmath13 , such that the ratio @xmath49 vanishes at @xmath14 .",
    "the reason is that for the two bands with the same sign of dispersion , there are no free carriers at @xmath50 , hence the pairing can not create images of the original bands . indeed , we show that in the model with two electron bands , the pairing gap @xmath25 , which is responsible for the fermi surface reconstruction , scales at @xmath3 as @xmath53 and vanishes at @xmath14 .",
    "the same behavior holds at @xmath3 in the 2d one - band model .",
    "@xcite    superconductivity in a system with two electron bands is realized experimentally in nb - doped srtio@xmath15 and , possibly , in heterostructures of laalo@xmath15 and srtio@xmath15   ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fermi energy in one of the bands is finite already at zero doping and @xmath0 is likely much larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the other electron band is above the chemical potential at zero doping , but the chemical potential @xmath44 moves up with doping and enters this band once it exceeds the critical value @xmath54 .",

    "the only difference with the `` canonical '' bec behavior in 3d , where strong coupling is a must , is that in our weak coupling model bound pairs are not tightly bound molecules because the two fermions in a pair are separated on average at distances by a distance well above the interatomic spacing .",

    "one distinction between 2d and 3d cases is that in our 2d case the scattering amplitude @xmath505 is temperature dependent , hence the formulas relating @xmath2 and @xmath508 are transcendental equations , which have to be solved with @xmath505 taken from a separate measurement .",
    "our results confirm earlier bcs analysis by several groups  @xcite that in the one hole / one electron band model @xmath55 does nt tend to zero if @xmath0 on one band vanishes , and it remains finite even when one of the bands is located entirely below or entirely above the fermi level . however , previous works identified @xmath2 with @xmath5 , while we show that @xmath26 only when @xmath7 , while at @xmath10 @xmath5 is numerically substantially smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "our results for @xmath2 also differ from these earlier works because they neglected the temperature dependence of the chemical potential .    with respect to applications to fe - based superconductors",
    ", our results do confirm that @xmath5 does not vanish when one of hole bands sinks below the fermi level ot moves as a whole above the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , the gap on this band is generally higher than that on the bands which cross the fermi level .",
    "the gap ratio is non - universal and depends on the mass ratio and/or presence of additional bands .",

    "@xcite and for fete@xmath19se@xmath20 in ref .",
    "we note in passing that one does not need to invoke a highly unconventional concept of the ultra - strong pairing at all momenta in the brillouin zone  @xcite to explain the data",

    "are only a few @xmath542 , and are comparable to @xmath5 . for the two - band model , we found that @xmath2 and @xmath5 do differ by a sizable factor , and there exists an intermediate @xmath42 range of preformed pair behavior .",

    "<S> @xmath5 remains of order @xmath2 , and both remain finite at @xmath14 and of order @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the preformed pair behavior still does exist in this model because @xmath5 is numerically smaller than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for both models we re - express @xmath2 in terms of the fully renormalized two - particle scattering amplitude by extending to two - band case the method pioneered by gorkov and melik - barkhudarov back in 1961 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our results for the model with a hole and an electron band to fe - pnictides and fe - chalcogenides in which superconducting gap has been detected on the bands which do not cross the fermi level , and to fese , in which superconducting gap is comparable to the fermi energy . we apply the results for the model with two electron bands to nb - doped srtio@xmath15 and argue that our theory explains rapid increase of @xmath5 when both bands start crossing the fermi level . </S>"
