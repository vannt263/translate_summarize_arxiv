    "zeplin  iii  @xcite is a two - phase ( liquid / gas ) xenon detector developed to observe low energy nuclear recoils resulting from the elastic scattering of galactic weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite . a key feature of zeplin ",
    "iii is the ability to discriminate between incident particle species for each event by recording both vacuum ultraviolet scintillation light and electroluminescence from ionisation of the xenon target  @xcite .",
    "the ratio in signal strength from these channels differs for electron and for nuclear recoil interactions , allowing the efficient rejection of most background events .",
    "however , in the absence of an electromagnetic interaction , weak and strong elastic scattering events appear identical , making the rejection of single scatter background neutron events difficult  @xcite .",
    "additionally , even with good discrimination , for large exposures a small fraction of electron - recoil events can be misidentified as nuclear recoils . with predicted wimp event rates of less than 0.1 events / kg / day , and with energy depositions of the order of 10 kev , dark matter detectors such as zeplin ",
    "iii must reduce the number of background events , especially due to neutrons , by a very large factor . typically this is achieved through the use of high purity components of low radionuclide content , hydrocarbon and lead shielding external to the detector to attenuate and moderate neutrons and @xmath1-rays originating in the local environment , as well as the operation of the detector at a site with large rock overburden to reduce the cosmic muon flux .",
    "having been manufactured from low background components such as oxygen free copper , shielded with 30  cm of high density polypropylene and lead , and situated at the boulby underground laboratory , uk , the background event rate of zeplin ",
    "iii is already greatly reduced .",
    "sensitivity to spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross sections as low as 8.1@xmath310@xmath2  pb for a wimp mass of 55 gev / c@xmath4 has been demonstrated  @xcite , as well as a spin - dependent wimp - neutron cross section as low as 1.8@xmath310@xmath5  pb  @xcite .",
    "however , to improve the sensitivity of the device further , zeplin  iii is being retrofitted with an active veto detector . since wimps are highly unlikely to interact within a detector system twice , any event doing so may be discarded . following this upgrade , the predicted combined background event rate in zeplin ",
    "iii translates into much less than one count within the wimp acceptance region for a one year dataset .",
    "the implementation of this veto system , in conjunction with new custom - built ultra - low background photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , will allow zeplin  iii to probe spin independent wimp - nucleon cross sections below the 10@xmath2  pb level .",
    "experimental measurements have been made of the individual performance and radiological content of all components .",
    "these results have been fed into an end - to - end monte carlo simulation of the zeplin ",
    "iii instrument  @xcite , coupled with the entire veto detector array located in the boulby mine , to evaluate the overall performance",
    ". an iterative process has been followed in which , with the geometry of the scintillator defined , alternative additional components and light collection efficiency were evaluated , informed by further experimental data where necessary .    in the following sections we first describe the general design of the veto .",
    "we then provide details of the measurements of the radioactivity content of the components , the performance of components , and the optimisation process .",
    "finally we provide results from the evaluation of the predicted overall performance of the veto .",
    "figures  [ vetofig1 ] and  [ cad ] depict schematically the veto system , while table  [ table ] presents key parameters of the overall system and its components .",
    "it consists of 52 individual bars of plastic scintillator arranged so as to provide @xmath63@xmath7  sr coverage around zeplin  iii .",
    "thirty - two bars are 100  cm long , 15  cm thick parallelepipeds with trapezoidal cross section , that form a closed ring of outer diameter 160  cm ( the ` barrel ' ) .",
    "these are arranged to stand on a continuous 30  cm thick base piece of passive polypropylene shielding .",
    "a single 3-inch pmt is optically coupled to one end of each bar .",
    "pmts are a likely significant source of background radioactivity .",
    "as such they are positioned on the lower face of the scintillator bars , in recessed holes in the base piece , thus keeping them farther from the zeplin ",

    "iii are the 32 gd - loaded polypropylene pieces and roof plug ( labelled b and hatched ) . surrounding these are the active scintillator modules ( c ) with pmts housed in cups and recessed into the lower polypropylene structure .",
    "the 20 roof modules of scintillator ( d ) rest on the roof plug .",

    "iii instrument are positioned 32 pieces of 15  cm thick gadolinium ( gd ) loaded polypropylene forming a barrel of outer diameter 130  cm .",
    "the scintillator and polypropylene barrels are rotated with respect to one another to ensure no line - of - sight gaps to the detector .",
    "polypropylene has been chosen because of its high hydrogen content , machinebility , and low radioactivity  @xcite .",
    "for ease of manufacture the gadolinium is added to the polypropylene in the form of 10  @xmath8 m gd@xmath9o@xmath10 powder mixed in to rutherford type 71 epoxy  @xcite .",
    "this mixture is set within 2  mm wide , 10  mm pitch vertical slots throughout the polypropylene .",
    "monte carlo simulations and experimental tests indicate that for neutron capture there is negligible difference between a uniform distribution and a discrete pattern , provided that the pitch of the slots does not exceed @xmath1115  mm ( see section  [ pitchmc ] below ) .",
    "the polypropylene and the scintillator parallelepiped bars are secured together to provide mechanical stability .",
    "monte carlo simulations have also been employed to confirm that mm - sized voids between or within attached standing scintillator modules result in neither a significant loss in neutron detection efficiency nor increased exposure to background for zeplin  iii ( see section  [ voidsmc ] below ) .    a 15  cm thick , 115  cm diameter disc of gadolinium - loaded polypropylene forms a roof piece , with the remaining 20 plastic scintillator bars resting on it to form a roof that extends over the full diameter of the barrel modules , as shown in figure  [ vetofig1 ] .",
    "a single pmt is optically coupled to the outer end of each roof bar , again maintaining maximum distance between veto pmts and the xenon target .",
    "the combined thickness of the passive and active hydrocarbon shielding is 30  cm , the same used in the first zeplin ",
    "iii science run  @xcite .",
    "the veto system is itself enclosed within the existing 20  cm thick pb shielding of the zeplin ",
    "iii instrument ( see figure  [ cad ] ) .",
    "the geometry described above provides active rejection of background as follows .",
    "firstly , neutrons entering the hydrocarbon shielding are efficiently moderated to thermal energies , mostly via h scattering , and undergo radiative capture predominantly on @xmath12gd ( natural abundance 15.7% ) which has an extraordinarily high capture cross section of 2.4@xmath310@xmath13 barns  @xcite .",
    "the level of gadolinium loading required was explored and is described in section  [ pitchmc ] , where a value of at least 0.5@xmath14 by weight , averaged over the polypropylene , is determined .",
    "the neutron capture is accompanied with the emission of typically 34 @xmath1-rays of energy totalling @xmath118  mev , and at a loading of 0.5@xmath14 these are emitted with a mean delay of 35  @xmath8s from the time the neutron enters the loaded material .",
    "this is advantageous over a pure hydrocarbon system where radiative capture would occur after much longer periods of time and would lead to the release of a single 2.2  mev @xmath1-ray .",
    "thus , with the gadolinium - loaded components located within the plastic scintillators , there is a very high probability of recording at least one significant energy deposition .",
    "such a design exposes the scintillator to an increased rate of neutron background from the environment relative to zeplin  iii , thereby reducing diagnostic capability , but greatly increases the efficiency as an anti - coincidence detector for wimp - like neutron recoils in zeplin ",
    "iii  the primary function of the device .",
    "in the default mode of operation , data acquisition for the veto will be triggered predominantly by energy deposition in zeplin  iii , with event - by - event veto waveforms recording for 20  @xmath8s before and 300  @xmath8s afterwards , allowing for offline searching of coincidences .",
    "similarly , @xmath1-ray emission , directly from components within zeplin  iii or otherwise , can lead to energy deposition in the scintillator .",
    "this allows coincident background events within zeplin  iii , predominantly from compton scattering , to be identified .",
    "in addition to operating as an active veto , this device will provide significant diagnostic capability for zeplin  iii , using independent triggering and providing a measurement of cosmic - ray muon fluxes , enhanced calibration capabilities and , by being a large volume low threshold device , permitting independent measurements of the neutron and @xmath1-ray background environment in the laboratory around zeplin  iii .",
    "the veto design has several further advantages . unlike with a liquid scintillator , where there is a possibility of leaks developing , the plastic veto scintillator bars are less of a chemical and fire hazard .",
    "additionally , the modular design structure means that individual modules can easily be removed and repaired or modified if required without disturbing the remaining detectors or systems . as a diagnostic device , since signals generated in the veto are highly unlikely to appear in more than a few modules , a degree of directional reconstruction is possible , especially for cosmic - rays .",
    "thirdly , with the scintillator on the outside of the polypropylene , the veto has the ability to run in several modes simultaneously , with , for example , continuous recording of background as well as timelines where zeplin  iii has triggered , regardless of whether the veto has detected an event .",
    "finally , the response of the entire system can be modelled accurately by incorporating the measured performance of each unit into a simulation , as opposed to the use of global parameters applied across a large volume and mass .",
    "at a vertical depth of 1070  m ( 2850  m water - equivalent shielding ) , the cosmic ray muon flux is reduced by a factor of @xmath1110@xmath15 to a level of ( 3.79@xmath160.15)@xmath310@xmath2 muons cm@xmath5 s@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the resultant neutrons from cosmic ray muon spallation and secondary cascades lead to a neutron scattering rate in zeplin ",
    "iii of @xmath191 event / year for a nuclear recoil energy above 10  kev within the central 8  kg of xenon  @xcite .",
    "thus , the most important background that must be considered comes from the local environment of the laboratory and the instruments themselves .",
    "consequently , all components proposed for use in the veto have been assayed for their radiological content .",
    "the main contributions come from radioisotopes along the u and th decay chains , which produce background neutrons via ( @xmath20,n ) reactions on other materials and from spontaneous fission , as well as numerous @xmath1-rays .",
    "the @xmath21-decay of @xmath22k , which contaminates natural potassium at 100 ppm concentrations , generates 1.461  mev @xmath1-rays . to assess the overall neutron and @xmath1-ray environment that the instruments will be exposed to , additional measurements of many other components have also been considered , for example the zeplin  iii instrument pmts and the cavern rock .",
    "two principal methods have been employed to determine the radioactivity content of components .",

    "upper limits from either set of measurements ( hpge or icp  ms / oes ) have been used as inputs for simulations , described in section  [ mc ] , performed to assess the impact of radiological contamination in the veto components on zeplin  iii as well as in the veto itself .",
    "the overall capability of the veto relies on the performance of individual components as well as on the geometry and methodology in which they are used . in this section",
    "we report on the technical performance of key components : the pmts , the plastic scintillator , the front - end electronics and the data acquisition system .",

    "voltage divider networks ( etl c647bfn2 - 01 ) were fitted to low background b14a bases supplied by etel , with u , th and k contamination levels measured to be consistent with , or lower than , the manufacturer stated values of 13  ppb , 19  ppb and 21  ppm , respectively . to amplify the small signals from low energy events and to impedance - match the output of the pmt to the data acquisition digitisers , pre - amplifiers",
    "have been designed and manufactured that give a gain of @xmath1110 .",
    "the preamplifiers are tooled onto surface mount printed circuit boards made from light - weight low - background single - sided resin bonded paper .",
    "the pmts and their bases ( including the voltage divider network and the preamplifier board ) are secured within a pvc cylinder which is itself chemically bonded directly to the scintillator .",
    "springs mounted in the cylinder cap provide support for the pmt , pushing it into contact with the scintillator surface via bc-630 optical coupling grease .",
    "the pmts are operated with negative bias supplied by lecroy 1443nf boards within a lecroy 1440 hv high voltage system .",
    "all power supply and signal cabling for the photocathode - anode ( k - a ) hv , pre - amplifier power , and signal output , has been manufactured to order with minimal radiological contamination .",
    "single photoelectron ( spe ) integrated pulse height spectra from dark thermionic emission have been obtained for each pmt , an example of which is shown in figure  [ spespec ] .",
    "the average dark count rate is found to be approximately 300  hz . by design ,",
    "the 10  mhz sampling frequency of the data acquisition is sufficient for good recovery of spe signals , allowing these to be used routinely for relative gain characterisation .",
    "these spectra were taken with no scintillator or other light sources present .",
    "for these measurements a single reference pmt was used assuring environmental and electrical uniformity across tests , with both the reference and test pmt housed in a light - tight box .",
    "the bias voltage of the test pmt was varied until the spectral peak position observed from single photoelectron emission from the photocathode was matched to that of the reference pmt .",
    "this was repeated for all pmts .     a typical single photoelectron spectrum ( solid line ) , with a partial gaussian fit to the peak ( dashed line ) , obtained from a pmt in the absence of a light source and with no plastic scintillator attached.,width=325 ]    with pmt bias voltages adjusted to yield normalised spe spectra , the quantum efficiency ( qe ) and gain of each pmt was calibrated .",
    "this was performed by illuminating the test pmt photocathode with a blue led to stimulate emission from the photocathode .",
    "the number of photoelectrons observed was then calculated using two different methods .    in the first method",
    ", a statistical approach is adopted where the number of photoelectrons detected is determined from the width of the distribution generated .",
    "the width of the peak seen from the led is dominated by the poissonian statistics of the photoelectron emission , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the measured standard deviation , @xmath31 is the centroid of the peak , and @xmath32 is the mean number of photoelectrons emitted for events in the peak",
    ". this will underestimate the total number of photoelectrons from a pmt , since it does not account for additional contributions to @xmath30 , the most important being the width of the spe spectrum itself .",
    "however , as was the case here , this can be mitigated somewhat by generating a large number of photoelectrons such that the width of the distribution is much greater than the width of the spe spectrum .",
    "the second and more traditional method is to calculate the number of detected photoelectrons by simply dividing the peak position of the led spectrum by that obtained from the single photoelectron response from dark spontaneous emission .",
    "the measured response was then normalised to absolute qe when 3 out of the 52 pmts were absolutely calibrated at etel .",
    "the distribution of qes , as plotted in figure  [ qe ] , shows good agreement between both methods used for estimating the number of photoelectrons .",
    "the gain normalised measurements confirmed the relative qes between pmts for sensitivities of 50  a / lm and 200  a / lm as quoted by the manufacturer .",

    "two methods have been used giving broadly consistent results .",
    "three pmts spanning the range of performance were assessed for absolute quantum efficiency externally ; these are indicated by the filled symbols . a linear fit through the data points",
    "is drawn to highlight the bias between the two methods used.,width=325 ]      the 1057  kg of scintillator material is polystyrene based ups923a ( p - terphenyl 2% , popop 0.02% ) produced by amcrys  h , kharkov , ukraine  @xcite .",
    "this material emits scintillation light with a peak intensity at 420  nm and with a rise time of 0.9  ns and decay time of 3.3  ns .",
    "the density of ups923a is 1.06 g  @xmath33 and its refractive index is 1.52 .",
    "the nominal light output for the material is stated as 55% of anthracene .",
    "the transparency of the scintillator material is determined by the so - called bulk attenuation length ( bal ) which is the length that reduces the initial light intensity by factor e according to the buger-lambert law , and is expected to be greater than 1  m ( see later for measured values ) .",
    "a previous study by the manufacturers suggests this material to have long - term stability , such that there is no natural degradation reported over a 12  year period  @xcite .    to minimise loss of light within a scintillator bar",
    "each piece has been wrapped along its length with ptfe sheet giving it a high diffuse reflectivity .",
    "experimental tests were performed comparing a number of diffuse and specular reflective wrapping materials including white paper , aluminised mylar , vituki  3 m  @xcite and other ptfe - based sheeting .",
    "three layers of 76  @xmath34 thick ptfe film  @xcite was found to provide the most cost effective option , increasing light collection by up to a factor of 2 at the pmt . at the far end from the pmt",

    "the pmt itself is housed in a light tight cup bonded to the scintillator.,width=325 ]    the performance of each of the 52 pieces has been assessed individually as follows . for each fully wrapped plastic scintillator module , spectra of the pmt response to a @xmath35na calibration source were recorded for each of six positions along the length . to ensure consistency , the same pmt ,",
    "voltage divider network , preamplifier and operating bias were used in these measurements .",
    "additionally , the use of optical grease was omitted to reproduce conditions as exactly as possible across scintillators .",
    "it was found that without the optical grease the number of photoelectrons detected is approximately halved , and this is confirmed by monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "the measurements were performed in a surface laboratory of predominantly concrete construction , and thus , for plastic scintillators of this size , a high rate of @xmath1-rays from the local environment was observed . to reduce this contribution , events seen in the plastic scintillators were required to be in coincidence with events in a 3 `` diameter , 3 '' long nai scintillation detector placed on the other side of the radioactive source from the plastic scintillator . since @xmath35na decays by @xmath36 emission this greatly enhanced the fraction of events caused by the 511  kev annihilation and 1275  kev de - excitation @xmath1-rays .",
    "however , since @xmath1-rays produce largely compton electrons in organic scintillators at these energies , the trigger signal of the nai detector can come either from another @xmath1-ray , or from the compton - scattered @xmath1-rays detected in the plastic scintillator . in the latter ,",
    "the shape of the energy spectrum may be effected since compton electrons in the scintillator deposit lower energy and yet the scattered @xmath1-ray retains sufficient energy to trigger the nai .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the experimental setup confirmed that , with the geometry used for these measurements , the rate of such events relative to true coincidence triggers from separate gamma - rays was negligible .    a typical compton spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ balfig ] , revealing features corresponding to the 511  kev @xmath1-rays , as well as a weaker peak corresponding to the 1275  kev @xmath1-ray emission following @xmath36 decay of @xmath35na , and a background well described by an exponential trend .",
    "the calibration between observed compton peak position and number of photoelectrons has been used to allow this spectrum to be plotted in terms of numbers of photoelectrons .",
    "a two - partial - gaussian - plus - exponential fit was made to the data and the movement of the centroid of the partial gaussians and the compton edge as a function of the position of the source along the length was used as the indicator of the technical attenuation length ( tal ) .",
    "the bal describes the attenuation of photons in a beam due to the scintillator only , whereas the tal parameter is an auxiliary parameter .",
    "the difference between the and bal comes from the fact that the real light path from the vertex of the interaction to the pmt is longer than a straight line path , since most of of the light reaching the pmt has been reflected at the surface of the scintillator bar through total internal reflection .",
    "the measured tal combines geometry effects ( light path , reflection ) , light attenuation , wavelength shift ( due to wavelength dependent absorption and re - emission ) and wavelength dependent quantum efficiency of the photo cathode . in the case of the modules measured here , a highly - reflective specular mirror surface has also been placed at the opposite end to the pmt . consequently , one expects , to first order , the response as a function of distance from the pmt to vary as the sum of two exponentials , one describing the reduction due to the separation of pmt and source position , and one which describes the reduction due to the distance between the pmt and the image of the source in the mirror : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the centroid of the measured photopeak , @xmath39 is the distance from the pmt face , @xmath40 is the length of the scintillator module ( the distance between the pmt and the mirror ) , @xmath41 is the tal and @xmath42 an arbitrary scaling constant . in principle , one could use a different scaling for the term describing the response due to reflections from the mirror , effectively accounting for imperfect reflection from it , but the quality of the data available did not justify an additional free parameter . the measurements of tal have been complemented with cosmic ray muon measurements in which the nai coincidence detector was replaced by two small plastic scintillator detectors placed above and below the test piece . in this case",

    "the programs should be capable of modelling the transport and interactions of particles ( essentially neutrons and @xmath1-rays ) internal and external to zeplin  iii and the veto through to the production of electron and nuclear recoils .",
    "the program must then simulate the physical processes involved in the generation of the optical response to scintillation ( and electroluminescence in zeplin ",

    "it was found that a depth of 3  m for neutrons and 0.25  m for @xmath1-rays is sufficient to accurately simulate the flux emanating from these surfaces ( @xmath191% contribution to uncertainty ) . for simulations of measurements made in surface laboratories , the details of the walls , tables and other large objects in the vicinity",
    "were included as necessary . the light yield and bal of the scintillator and the single photoelectron response and the qe of the pmts",

    "a nuclear recoil energy deposition generates much less electronic excitation ( primary scintillation and ionisation ) than an electron recoil event of similar energy due to ` quenching ' .",
    "a quenching coefficient is defined as the ratio of the amount of light induced by a recoil nucleus to the amount of light induced by an electron of the same kinetic energy .",
    "a ( conservative ) quenching coefficient of 0.1 is assumed for neutron energy depositions occurring in the plastic scintillator  @xcite .",
    "since the efficiency for rejecting coincident events with zeplin  iii comes from detection of @xmath1-rays , a large variation in quenching factor of the plastic scintillator makes negligible difference to the results presented .    each energy deposition occurring within an active volume",
    "is converted to a number of photoelectrons seen by the pmt .",
    "this has been performed in two ways .",
    "firstly , an option in the monte carlo simulation allows each of these energy depositions to be converted to scintillation photons , and for these scintillation photons to be tracked to the photocathode , with losses occurring at points of reflection and due to the bulk attenuation .",
    "rayleigh scattering is included .",
    "poisson statistics are then applied to determine how many photoelectrons are generated .",
    "since this is effectively a further complete simulation for each energy deposition , this option is slow and has been used only where necessary , principally to correlate measured tal values with intrinsic bal of the scintillators , and to allow the light emission of the scintillator to be determined .",
    "the second much faster option is to simply apply the expected loss due to the measured tal given the distance from the end of the scintillator .",
    "since the measured and simulated tals agree , a further refinement to the simulation has been to use the monte carlo to estimate the fully 3d - dependent tal throughout the scintillator , rather than a single mean value that describes the unit as a whole .",
    "the central function of the veto detector is to facilitate rejection of events that , on the basis of zeplin ",
    "iii data alone , could be mistaken for wimps .",
    "the principal characteristics of candidate events in zeplin  iii are that they have an electroluminescence - to - scintillation ratio characteristic of nuclear recoils , occur within the fiducial volume , and cause an energy deposition of @xmath4450  kevnr@xmath45 .",
    "the complete end - to - end simulation has been performed with all energy depositions in zeplin  iii and the veto recorded .",
    "while for the first science run the main contribution to background was the activity of the pmts of the zeplin ",
    "iii device itself , after the upgrade it is expected that no single source will dominate overwhelmingly - the contributions from pmts , components and from the rock walls being similar .",
    "differences arise due to the activity levels particular to each case , and due to the propagation of the radiation from point of origin through to detection .",
    "thus , the efficiency of the veto in rejecting background neutrons has been estimated by considering each of these contributions separately , and then adding the contributions appropriately .    in its simplest mode , an event that satisfies the zeplin ",
    "iii criteria for a wimp can be rejected by the veto if any one of the scintillator modules registers , within an appropriate time window ( @xmath4620 to + 300  @xmath8s ) , a signal significantly above background .",
    "these are dubbed ` tagged ' events , and a tagging efficiency can be calculated as a function of the veto signal size ( see figure  [ effvsphe ] ) . a reasonably weak dependence on veto threshold is seen , with a maximum tagging efficiency at zero threshold of 80% possible : about 20% of neutron background events that satisfy the wimp - search criteria in zeplin ",
    "iii have no interaction in any of the veto modules . in reality ,",
    "a threshold of 6 photoelectrons in any single scintilator is sufficient to provide a minimal accidental coincidence contribution to overall event rate , and therefore this has been used as the conservative hard threshold within any module in simulations of the veto .",
    "lower limit efficiencies derived from this threshold determine the minimum neutron and gamma - ray background reduction in zeplin  iii . for the barrel modules ,",
    "6 photoelectrons corresponds to a typical energy deposition of 135  kev at the far end and it is predicted that @xmath665@xmath14 of background neutrons that could otherwise have been misidentified as wimps will be rejected by the veto with this threshold . however , as stated , since there is no hard threshold trigger for the veto when triggering in its slave mode , a higher tagging efficiency for coincident events ( up to a maximum of 80% ) is achievable .",
    "this represents a substantial improvement on previous anti - coincidence systems such as the veto used by the zeplin ",

    ", it could be possible to increase the tagging efficiency further by searching for smaller energy depositions occurring in multiple modules simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ tagfrac ] extends figure  [ effvsphe ] to explore the summed energy deposition in multiple scintillator modules . since there exists no energy threshold for coincidence veto events when in slave mode of operation it is possible to apply not just single module thresholds , but a threshold on the sum energy of a veto event .",
    "in this case a veto event would be defined as the sum of all veto modules with signals above a minimal threshold as low as 1 photoelectron and occuring in coincidence with one another within a short time window of a few @xmath8s duration .",
    "the former condition takes advantage of the mutliple @xmath1-rays emitted following gd capture causing interactions in multiple modules to maximise the tagging efficiency of the veto system .",
    "the latter condition restricts the number of random coincidence events with zeplin ",
    "iii by demanding all @xmath1-ray signals seen in multiple modules belong to the same event constrained within the timing window . since 320  @xmath8s timelines are recorded for each module a number of such events may be observed .",
    "figure  [ tagfrac ] shows the neutron tagging efficiency of the veto as a function of the sum of photoelectrons detected from each modules registering at least one photoelectron .",
    "it is seen that the tagging efficiency has a much stronger dependence on the number of scintillator modules than on the signal size . with a summed signal of 6 photoelectrons",
    "the nominal 65% tagging efficiency is acieved from any single module registering 6 or more photoelectrons . however , this efficiency is supplemented by events where the 6 photoelectrons are distributed , in any hit pattern , across multiple modules and the efficiency is increased to almost 70% .",

    "the very high neutron capture cross section of @xmath12gd , combined with the subsequent emission of up to 8  mev of @xmath1-rays , is the principle reason for the high neutron tagging efficiency . removing the gd entirely results in the neutron tagging efficiency for this geometry to drop to below 45% for a 6 phe threshold .",
    "the results presented so far are for a loading of 0.5% by weight , which was the value eventually adopted ; here we explore the effect of different concentrations and distributions of gadolinium .",
    "the incorporation of gd into the polypropylene has two main effects .",
    "firstly , increasing the fraction of gadolinium increases the fraction of internal neutrons that are captured by the gadolinium isotopes , as opposed ( mainly ) to capture on the hydrogen content of the polypropylene and plastic scintillator . since the @xmath12gd capture in particular",
    "is followed by emission of several energetic @xmath1-rays , this also tends to increase the tagging efficiency .",
    "this is illustrated in the upper panel of figure  [ gdloadingfig ] in which an exposure to neutrons from known background sources of the entire zeplin  iii ",
    "veto system has been simulated . for events that satisfy the wimp search criteria ( fiducial volume , @xmath4450  kevnr )",

    "is made , indicating that at this level of loading , essentially all neutrons that thermalise in the polypropylene are captured by the gadolinium .",
    "the second effect of including gadolinium is that the mean time before neutron capture is reduced . in terms of experimental infrastructure ,",
    "a short capture time is desirable because it allows a larger fraction of coincidences to be identified for a given coincidence time window , or alternatively , for a shorter window to be used reducing data volume and the false - coincidence rate .",
    "the mean time between tagged signals in zeplin  iii and the veto , as a function of gadolinium concentration , is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ gdloadingfig ] . here",
    "we see that above about a 1% loading , further increase ceases to reduce the capture time , indicating that capture is occurring very soon after thermalisation .",
    "simulations have also shown that neutrons are effectively moderated to thermal energies whether they originate externally to the veto ( such as from the rock around the laboratory ) or from within the internal volumes enclosed by the veto ( such as from zeplin  iii itself ) .",

    "this is the probability of any recorded timeline having an uncorrelated background - radioactivity caused signal within it . for the usual mode of slave operation , with",
    "the veto triggered to record for 320  @xmath8s by events from zeplin  iii at an estimated rate of  1  hz , the accidental coincidences rate is indicated by the right hand axis in figure  [ exposure ] . for nominal operational parameters",
    "the rate is less than 2% .",
    "the veto instrument consists of many modular pieces mechanically held together .",
    "as described in section  [ overalldesign ] , the plastic scintillators are deliberately offset relative to the polypropylene modules to prevent line - of - sight gaps that would compromise the shielding .",
    "there is , however , still a significant chance of introducing small gaps during construction and assembly . the monte carlo simulation has been employed to estimate the impact of such gaps occurring between the active modules , both in terms of degrading the shielding from external sources of background , and in terms of lowering the ability of the veto to tag coincident nuclear recoil events .",
    "the simulation was performed for two distinct cases : when gaps existed between both active and passive modules , and when gaps existed between only active modules ( in which case the passive modules were assumed to be completely closed ) . in the former case a direct path",
    "is formed for radiation that has penetrated the external lead shield to reach zeplin ",
    "simulation of a three year exposure that included gaps of 1  mm width , in excess of engineering constraints , showed no statistically significant increase in the zeplin ",
    "iii active volume single scatter rate .",
    "this is consistent with previous simulations performed to explore the impact of shielding due to the existing holes needed for pipework and cabling .",
    "moreover , the veto tagging efficiency remains unaffected until the gaps exceed a width of 1  cm .",
    "this is because a neutron , having originally entered the shielding or been internally generated , is unlikely to interact with zeplin  iii and exit the shielding through a gap again . in the latter sets of simulations , in which gaps between adjacent active scintillator modules were introduced assuming a continuous inner gd loaded polypropylene barrel",
    ", it was found that the efficiency for tagging coincident veto ",
    "iii nuclear recoil events begins to be significantly reduced for gaps of widths greater than 2  cm , essentially due to less coverage for @xmath1-ray detection following neutron capture .",
    "the neutron flux seen by zeplin ",
    "iii from external background is unaffected until the gap exceeds 1  cm between scintillator modules .",
    "all veto components have been shipped underground to the boulby laboratory with active and passive modules coupled in preparation for installation . the full veto array , complete with data acquisition and synchronisation hardware , led calibration systems and data reduction software has been successfully assembled within the pb castle .",
    "this was done in the absence of zeplin  iii to test systems prior to final installation .",
    "neutron and @xmath1-ray source exposures as well as background runs have been performed and data recorded for _ in situ _ calibration and characterisation of the detector .",

    "detailed geant4 monte carlo simulations have been used to aid in the characterisation of the veto , and to estimate its overall performance .",
    "in addition to providing valuable diagnostic information , it is expected that the veto will be able to reject over 65% of neutrons , and over 15% of @xmath1-rays from background radioactivities , whilst contributing negligibly to the zeplin ",
