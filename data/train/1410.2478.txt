    "since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1995 around the star 51 pegasi by mayor and queloz @xcite , a plethora of planetary bodies orbiting other stars was found and this category of celestial objects has been increasing in size at an almost exponential pace .",
    "the number of such objects discovered by both terrestrial and space - based observation is rapidly approaching 2000 , with over 5000 candidates in existence .",
    "radial velocity @xcite and astrometry @xcite remain the main indirect detection methods used to identify low magnitude perturbations in the motion of the host star while transit detections @xcite , microlensing @xcite or direct imaging @xcite seek to reveal new planets through direct photometric , gravitational or optical effects generated by their presence .",
    "the fraction of stars where planetary systems are present is in general estimated from both theoretical observations and observational data to be around 30 - 40% .",
    "+ a significant number of the newly discovered exoplanets ( more than 60% ) are part of multiple planetary systems , and , as the detection sensitivity continues to increase , they will most likely become the norm . based on their mass , density , and semimajor axis ,",
    "they are typically classified into several notable categories : + a ) hot jupiters - giant planets with masses comparable to jupiter s size ( probably with a small rocky core surrounded by metallic hydrogen and a thick atmosphere ) , conventionally taken as 100 times the mass of earth ( @xmath0 ) or more , orbiting very close to the host star , at distances where their surface temperatures are of the order of hundreds to thousands of celsius degrees @xcite ; + b ) jupiters - planets similar to jupiter in appearance and surface temperature , normally found near or beyond the host star s  snow line \" @xcite ; + c ) neptunes - objects that resemble neptune , with masses of 10 - 100 @xmath0 , most often made of a small rock core surrounded by a larger ice mantle ( water , ammonia or methane ) and a thick atmosphere ; normally found beyond the star s  snow line \" @xcite ; + d ) hot neptunes - giant planets similar to neptune , with masses of 10 - 100 @xmath0 , orbiting the host star at a distance that rises their surface temperature to several hundreds celsius degrees or more @xcite ; + e ) terrestrial - type planets - rocky objects surrounded by a thin atmosphere , with masses up to 10 @xmath0 , a significant fraction of them consisting of super - earths @xcite ; the terrestrial planets positioned into the habitable zone are of particular importance , as possible hosts for life ; + f ) mini - neptunes - gas dwarfs with a mass comparable with that of terrestrial planets ( i.e. less than 10 @xmath0 ) , but with a low density ; if their atmosphere also has a low density this might be due to a significant water layer , several thousands km deep and they can be classified as ocean planets @xcite ; + g ) brown dwarfs - objects at the boundary between stars and planets , most often considered by convention as such if their masses are larger than 13 jupiter masses ( or about 4000 @xmath0 ) , the lowest value at which the deuterium fusion is possible @xcite . + the above - used classification is not exhaustive , with some possible cases in - between , for example terrestrial - type planets ( super - earths ) with masses larger than 10 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , statistically , such a classification appears to be accurate in most situations . +",
    "the causes that determine the distribution of mass and momentum of the orbiting bodies in multiplanetary systems are still incompletely understood and depend on many parameters , including the host star type and rotation speed , the initial mass of the protoplanetary disk and its distribution , external gravitational perturbations , chemical composition of the initial nebula mass and planet migration .",
    "for this reason , the subsequent stable or quasi - stable configuration of a planetary system might give insights to these initial conditions and fuel a better understanding of the processes that generate the planet formation .",
    "+ after a planetary system has formed , the combined work of gravitational perturbations of all the orbiting bodies push it towards certain structure types",
    ". if these perturbations are satisfactorily quantified , the composition and dynamics of the system can be at least partly explained .",
    "the analysis of the apparition and propagation of perturbations in multiplanetary systems requires solving the classical newtonian n - body problem . with suitable approximations",
    "it is possible to find analytical solutions to particular configurations and these solutions can be used for systems with two or more planets .",
    "this can be done by considering the effects of the purely secular terms in the disturbing function for a system of n masses orbiting a central body - also known as the secular perturbation theory .",
    "+ for certain cases , where the ratio of two planets orbital periods ( or characteristic frequencies ) is close to a ratio of integer numbers , they are said to be in or near resonance . for the resonance case",
    ", the periodic oscillation motion resembles that of a pendulum , inducing libration while the relative planet positions swing back and forth during an integer number of complete orbits . during the motion out of the resonance range",
    ", the libration transforms into circulation with the two modes separated by an apsidal separatrix . the boundary between libration ( either aligned or anti - aligned ) and circulation forms the simplest such type of separation boundary",
    "apparently , many of the known orbital systems lie close to apsidal separatrixes .",
    "+ if significant and relevant statistical data based on observations displaying the fraction of each planet type that is near a mean motion resonance can be gathered , it can be potentially tested either analytically or numerically to predict possible configurations in incompletely known systems .",
    "it can also generate a more detailed model of the structure and formation of multiplanetary systems .",
    "such a statistical study of the mean motion resonance and near - resonance occurrences in multiplanetary systems , using the available data from the confirmed exoplanets , makes the purpose of this article .",
    "the planetary resonances are thought to have an important role in defining the ultimate structure of a planetary system .",
    "they appear when the characteristic frequencies of two or more bodies orbiting a central , much larger mass , are close to an exact commensurability .",
    "when such a situation occurs , the gravitational forces exerted by planetary motions add up over time in a coherent manner .",
    "+ the simplest type of resonance is the mean - motion resonance and takes place when the orbital periods @xmath1 and @xmath2 of two planerts satisfy a relation of the type : @xmath3 with j and i positive integers .",
    "any mean - motion resonance has a well - defined width inside which the two orbiting bodies can have a libration movement around an equilibrium point .",
    "+ planetary resonances or near - resonances are also thought to explain some regularities in the orbital distribution of the planets in multiplanetary systems , including the so - called `` titius - bode '' rule .",
    "murray and dermott demonstrated in 1999 that most of the random systems of bodies orbiting a central mass after achieving a relatively stable configuration would obey a distribution type that fits a titius - bode pattern @xcite .",
    "+ winter and murray have classified the planetary mean - motion resonances into internal and external as a function of the dominant mass position relative to the reference body in resonance .",
    "while the internal resonances ( with the dominant mass on an external orbit ) have analytical solutions for restricted cases of planar , circular three - body problem , the external resonances are rather described numerically or using the hamiltonian approach . however , using these other methods makes the effect of the resonance on the orbital elements difficult to visualize and quantify .",
    "+ without insisting on the basic theory , described in detail in many previous works ( such as , but not limited to ) , it is worth mentioning that the variation of the orbital elements of two planets moving around the same star for a given potential can be described by the lagrange s equations , where the variations of the orbital elements determine the system s motion over time . from here , the orbital evolution of a test particle can be studied by direct integration of the equations of motion . + using the pendulum model approach",
    ", an analytical solution can be derived for an interior resonance of the form : @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 integers , @xmath7 and @xmath8 - the mean motions of the two orbiting bodies . in this case",
    ", the libration width of the test particle can be calculated directly @xcite .",
    "for the first order resonances , it can be expressed using the semimajor axis relative variation in the equation : @xmath9 or for the variation of the mean motion : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the semimajor axis , @xmath12 is the orbit eccentricity , @xmath7 the mean motion , @xmath13 .",
    "+ for the higher - order resonances , the expression changes into the simpler form @xcite : @xmath14 with @xmath6 the order of resonance .",
    "@xmath15 is described by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the perturber and @xmath18 the mass of the central object ( the host star ) .",
    "the function @xmath19 is the disturbing function , with @xmath20 the semimajor axis ratio for the two bodies in resonance .",
    "it can be expanded as a combination of laplace coefficients , depending on the resonance order .",
    "+ the expressions for @xmath19 are in fact already calculated in detail in `` solar system dynamics '' by murray and dermott @xcite , where they are described up to the 4th order resonances .",
    "once the expression for the disturbing function is known analytically for the resonance type of interest , its numerical value can be easily and accurately found through well known computational algorithms that have been in use for over half a century @xcite .",
    "+ if the semimajor axis or mean motion relative difference is within the libration width , one can estimate that the two planets are in mean - motion resonance . using an analytical expression for these values , as in eq .",
    "( 3 ) or ( 4 ) , simplifies and speeds up considerably a computational analysis algorithm for a large database of planets but can generate errors , especially when the internal orbiting body has a larger mass and the resonance can be better described as external .",
    "however , this difficulty can be largely avoided if the above method of calculation is used to estimate that a system is either in a resonant or a near - resonant state .",
    "the method can be then tested against the many known cases of the exoplanet resonances that had been thoroughly verified in the existing literature and the libration width for the systems that are considered near - resonant can be increased until the analytical calculations agree with other , more complex , methods of calculation and the available observational data .",
    "as already shown in the introductory section , the classification of planets depends strongly of their orbital parameters relative to the `` snow line '' , seen as the boundary where the water particles orbiting the host star switch from the state of vapors to ice .",
    "typically , the temperature where the vapors - ice switch occurs is considered to be in the range of 145 - 170 k @xcite . even though some highly eccentric orbits that cross this boundary may be encountered sometimes , the exoplanets are classified as inside or outside the snow line using their semi - major axis as a criterion for comparison . a way to find the value of this boundary in a fast and simple way ( necessary to analyze databases of @xmath21 stars ) but also sufficiently accurately to be used in a general planet classification",
    "is presented in this section .",
    "+ the snow line is calculated approximately for each stellar system using the results from the work of kennedy and kenyon @xcite ( a detailed explanation of the method can be found in their article ) .",
    "if a thin accretion disk is considered , its mid temperature during the pre - main sequence evolution can be written as a sum of its mid - plane temperature resulting from viscous forces within this disk and the contribution from the star irradiation : @xmath22 hubeny @xcite expresses the accretion temperature of the mid - plane as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being opacity of the disk and a function of temperature @xcite and @xmath26 the surface gas density ( about 100 times greater than the density of the dust @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is expressed , in its turn by @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath30 the star mass , @xmath31 the accretion rate , @xmath11 - the snow line ( expressed in au ) and @xmath32 the star radius . the value of @xmath31 is normally set to @xmath33 .",
    "+ the irradiation contribution from the disk temperature is described by the relation : @xmath34 with @xmath35 for a flared disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite . for an optical thick disk ,",
    "its temperature can be approximated with @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "once @xmath37 is set to 170 k as the preferred temperature for vapors - ice switch @xcite , the value of @xmath11 can be calculated from eq .",
    "+ a different approach to the calculation of the snow line is used by ida & linn @xcite .",
    "they have found the value of the snow line using the main sequence star luminosity ( @xmath38 ) and an optically thin disk ( @xmath39 ) and obtaining a dependency of the type : @xmath40 most literature estimates put the snow line for the solar system at about 2.7 au during the time of planet formation .",
    "the most compelling evidence for this value comes from the water - rich carbonaceous chondrite meteorites with the reflectance spectra matching the objects found in the outer asteroid belt beyond 2.5 au , while meteorites coming from the inner belt ( at around 2 au ) have negligible amounts of water @xcite .",
    "+     +    the snow line has a constant value for any host star if eq . (",
    "11 ) is applied , but it will change over time when it is calculated using the value of @xmath37 from eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "most of the literature sources use values of @xmath41 years , which is approximately the time needed for the formation of the giant planets . if eq .",
    "( 7 ) is used for a star of one solar mass , the 2.7 au value of the snow line is reached after @xmath42 years @xcite .",
    "calculating accurately the snow line is still a laborious process , necessitating the pre - main - sequence tracks for every involved star mass @xcite .",
    "however , for the temporal value of @xmath42 years a simple polynomial function can be used to fit a snow line ( measured in au ) with the data provided by kennedy and kenyon and to derive an approximate mass dependency for any stellar system described by the equation below : @xmath43 where @xmath30 is expressed in sun masses ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "+ when @xmath45 , a function derived directly from kennedy & kenyon is applied @xcite , while for @xmath46 , a different function was empirically calculated , to fit the reference data at @xmath47 and to reach the origin as the star mass decreases to 0 .",
    "( 12 ) is used in the next section to rapidly calculate the snow line for over a thousand stars surrounded by planetary bodies with masses varying from 0.02 to 5 solar masses .",
    "the plot of the resulting calculation using this method and also the line from the simple equation used by ida and linn @xcite , shown for comparison , are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the importance of the snow line location in planet formation can not be neglected and it shall be used further as a calibrator to divide the known exoplanets in categories . from the values of the snow line calculated with the method described in the previous section ,",
    "a logarithmic density plot of the planets was derived as a function of planet mass and the semimajor axis / snow line ratio ( figure 2 ) , for all the discovered exoplanets ( figure 2a ) and , separately , only for the planets found in multiple systems ( figure 2b ) . from figure 2a",
    "it can be seen that the planets tend to group in three main categories : + a ) objects with large masses ( over 100 @xmath0 ) and orbiting very close to the host star ( semimajor axis less than 10% of the snow line value ) - the hot jupiters ; + b ) objects with slighly higher masses than the first category ( most of them over 200 @xmath0 ) orbiting at about 10%-200% of the host star s snow line - the classical giant planets or jupiters ; + c ) bodies with masses between 0.9 @xmath48 20@xmath0 , orbiting the host star inside the snow line ( the terrestrial and some mini - neptune and neptune - type planets ) .",
    "this last category has a lower density plot , that comes mainly from the multiplanetary systems .",
    "+ the neptune or hot neptune - type planets are located in between these categories and occur less often than the main three categories . if only the objects from multiple systems are plotted ( figure 2b ) , the hot jupiters and some of the cooler giant planets disappear from the overall distribution graph .",
    "this fact proves that the hot - jupiter type objects have most likely migrated from the outside boundary of the snow line and absorbed most of the planet - making material from the initial nebula , preventing other sufficiently large planets from forming @xcite .",
    "the density plot for multiplanetary systems is left with two very loosely defined areas of terrestrial planets and cool giants with the intermediate - mass ice giants from the neptune category almost filling the gap .",
    "the planet masses appear to have a slight dependence of the snow line , tending to increase with the semimajor axis measured in snow line units .",
    "however , this should be regarded with caution , as the sensitivity of the observational methods in use is much higher for massive planets at large distances from the host star than for intermediate and low - mass objects .",
    "+ using the density plots from figure 2 , the planet classification presented in the introductory section was adjusted as following : + i ) brown dwarfs - objects with masses over 4000 @xmath0 ( or 13 jupiter masses ) ; + ii ) hot jupiters - objects with masses between 100 and 4000 @xmath0 and with a semimajor axis less than 10% of the snow line value ; + iii ) jupiters - same mass range as the hot jupiters , but with a semimajor axis larger than 10% of the snow line ; + iv ) hot neptunes - objects within a mass range of 10 @xmath48 100 @xmath0 and the semimajor axis less than 10% of the snow line ; + v ) neptunes - objects within a mass range of 10 @xmath48 100 @xmath0 and the semimajor axis larger than 10% of the snow line ; +    ) and normalized snow line for all discovered exoplanets ( a ) and the objects present in multiplanetary systems ( b ) .",
    "the snow line is represented by the yellow dashed line.__,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] +    \\vi ) mini neptunes - objects with a mass less than 10 @xmath0 but with a low density ( less than 3 g/@xmath49 ) - some of these planets could also be ocean planets ; + vii ) terrestrial planets - objects with masses up to 10 @xmath0 and the semimajor axis less than the snow line ; + viii ) ice - terrestrial planets ( or ice planets ) - bodies with masses up to 10 @xmath0 , but orbiting beyond the snow line and , in consequence expected to be composed mainly of frozen water , methane or ammonia ; it is interesting to observe that so far no such planets have yet been discovered in multiple systems ( most likely due to their high orbital period and the current limits of the detection sensitivity ) .",
    "+ it is well known that during the process of planet formation the giant planets begin to take shape outside the snow line boundary and almost all of them experience an inward migration process . as it can also be seen in figure 2a ,",
    "the vast majority of the known giant planets appear to have migrated inwards inside the snow line during their formation .",
    "the added category of `` ice planets '' has a low number of samples due to the small mas and large distance from the host star , which makes them difficult to detect with the current instruments .",
    "being situated beyond the snow line , it is most likely that they are built from materials with low evaporation points that had previously migrated from the inside of the stellar system .",
    "with the relatively high number of already discovered exoplanets , a general analysis of their orbital properties can be performed to determine statistically significant correlations between the mean motion resonance number or order for planets with adjacent orbits and the planet type . in order to achieve this ,",
    "software packages such as python @xcite and matplotlib @xcite were used for data analysis and respectively data plotting because of their high efficiency in processing of large amounts of information .",
    "data sets from http://exoplanet.eu ( lobservatoire de paris ) and http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu ( nasa exoplanet archive ) were downloaded and correlated into a single , combined catalog . while the first source was used as the main reference , data from the second website , related to planet density , star radius , stellar rotation and stellar activity was extracted and appended to it .",
    "+ the exoplanet detection method was neglected in this study .",
    "for example , it is well known that while the radial velocity technique measures the @xmath50 value , with @xmath51 the planet mass and @xmath52 the orbital angle , it would only provide the distribution of @xmath53 , but because this distribution for a random set of planetary systems is very close to the @xmath51 distribution @xcite , the mass parameters were used as displayed in the source databases .",
    "+ from a total of 1890 exoplanets discovered to date , 1166 planets are part of 479 multiple planetary systems .",
    "all these objects from multiple systems were analyzed and automatically classified in the eight categories described in the previous section .",
    "the planets where both the star mass and planet mass were known were classified as `` defined '' .",
    "the cases where the star mass was known , but not the planet mass , were classified as `` undefined '' while those where the star mass was unknown as `` unknown '' ( as shown in table 1 ) .",
    "+    ._the known exoplanets categories overall and in multiple systems , with the count and fraction of those in / near resonance .",
    "_ [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it was found that 69% of the known objects from multiple planetary systems had an inner / outer orbital period ratio between 1 and 3 for the adjacent orbits .",
    "overall 35% of the objects found in multiplanetary systems had their adjacent orbit ratios within 10% relative distance of the resonance numbers : 3/2 , 5/3 or 2 ( these were the most common resonances encountered overall ) . even though the analyzed systems are still incompletely known , the low number of occurrences for high orbital period ratios suggest that most planets tend to have stable orbits for orbital period ratios of the adjacent orbits lower than 5 . for ratios higher than 3",
    "it is also very likely that some planets ( or asteroid belts ) will be discovered there in the future to fill in the missing gaps . another",
    "interesting fact is that almost 41% of the defined planets ( i.e. those where the calculations could be made more precisely ) are near or in an orbital mean motion resonance .",
    "+ in order to quickly calculate the resonances or near - resonances of thousands of planet pairs , equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) were used for cases up to the 4th order .",
    "a simplified method was used for orders higher than 4 , with the libration width estimated from the equation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 was calculated empirically to be : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the resonance number and @xmath58 another empirical function dependent of it , described by the relation : @xmath59 with the planets automatically rearranged by increasing orbital period in each system and the orbital period ratio known , the orbital ratio values were compared to a list of resonance numbers ( given by integer number ratios ) and matched with the nearest value .",
    "then a test particle was placed onto the orbit of the inside planet .",
    "the planar , circular , restricted problem was used , with a body of an external orbit perturbing an inner body of negligible mass , as presented in most detail by murray and dermott in `` solar system dynamics '' @xcite .",
    "+ the libration width was calculated as described in section 2 .",
    "if the planet was inside the libration interval , it was considered in resonance . however , when compared with resonance data obtained through more advanced methods from other articles , it was found that the resonance condition tended to be in general too restrictive . to match the results of this simplified method with those published in other papers while using more accurate techniques , the libration width had to be adjusted .",
    "it was found that a value of three times the libration width was generating results that had the best match with data found in other publications .",
    "the planet type with which the inside or outside planet was in resonance was neglected in the statistics used here .",
    "+ because the method assumes that the interior planet has a negligible mass ( the libration width can be directly calculated only for internal resonances ) , it can , of course , generate errors .",
    "for this reason , the accuracy of the calculations was compared with over 51 cases of planets near or in resonance that were treated in deep detail and published in various scientific journals .",
    "the details of this comparison and the source references used in it are described in the appendix at the end of the article . it was found that the method produced accurate results in finding out whether a pair of planets is in resonance or near resonance in 86% of the situations . however , when the intention was only to estimate if a pair of planets is either in or near resonance , the precision reached 100% . in consequence ,",
    "an analysis of both planetary resonances and near resonances in multiplanetary systems was preferred .",
    "it was also assumed that the near - resonance cases were at least as important as resonance cases , due to the indications they can give about the evolution of a system from or into a resonant state . and last , but not least , some room was given for possible uncertainties in the accuracy of the existing data that could switch in the future a system from a resonant to a near - resonant state or the other way around .",
    "the comparison between the method used in this article and literature is shown in the appendix at the end of the article .",
    "+ various resonances were investigated up to the 4th order and up to the value 4 for the denominator and calculated using the method described in section 2 .",
    "resonances of orders higher than 4 were also calculated with the more approximate method described by eq .",

    "the terrestrial - type planets are almost as numerous as the hot neptunes and more common than the neptune - type planets .",
    "while the the objects with larger masses tend to be found more often in systems with single planets , terrestrial - type planets of mini - neptunes are seen more often in multiplanetary systems .",
    "+     +    the relatively low number of available samples in the observational data generated large error bars for a 95% confidence in some of the planet categories , however , the results are still statistically significant to compare , for example , jupiter or neptune - type planets with terrestrial planets .",
    "the fraction of planets in / near resonance appears to be higher for the categories with larger masses , with planets from categories with masses within comparable ranges having in general a similar fraction in / near resonance , with one exception - the brown dwarfs .",
    "however , in this case , the very low statistics still leaves enough room for a significant data change in the light of future discoveries . due to the fact that the occurrence of the brown dwarfs seems to increase as the mass of the host star decreases , it is also apparent that their formation process differs from that of the lower - mass planets , with these types of planetary objects being actually failed stars , ejected from the stellar embryos taking shape in the initial molecular cloud .",

    "a more approximate attempt to make estimates for the exoplanet distribution by resonance number was made for undefined and unknown planets , using a distribution function for the planet / star mass ratio from the defined planets data for the first category and an approximate mass ratio of @xmath63 for the second .",
    "the results in the first case appear similar to those from the defined category while in the second case they look visibly different .",
    "one can conclude that the approximate method that uses the mass ratio distribution function can bring satisfactory results while the fixed number approximation should be treated with caution .",
    "+ an attempt to derive a relationship between the planet mass and its resonance / near resonance fraction was also made by approximating the general and resonant / near resonant distributions with two exponential functions .",
