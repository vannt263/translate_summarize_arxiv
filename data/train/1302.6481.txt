    "during the last decades there has been an intense scrutiny of the standard model in the search for traces of new physics effects . however , up to the energy scales probed until now and except for some occasional tensions , the standard model has proven to be an extremely successful theory . moreover",
    ", the latest results from the lhc not only seem to confirm the higgs - like nature of the newly - found scalar  @xcite but continuously increase the gap between the standard model particles and the scale of new physics @xmath7 .    in the absence of new heavy particles in direct searches",
    "we should expect new physics to be first seen as virtual effects .",
    "these can generically be encoded as anomalous couplings for the different sectors of the theory : gauge - fermion interactions , gauge boson interactions ( oblique , triple - gauge and quartic ) and scalar interactions .",
    "given the large energy gap between the electroweak and the new physics scale , an effective field theory ( eft ) treatment becomes the best strategy to parametrize the new physics effects in a model - independent way .",
    "the main virtue of the eft treatment is that the standard model symmetries are automatically implemented in the anomalous couplings .",
    "the resulting constraints from @xmath8 symmetry make it transparent that ( i ) the number of independent parameters is typically smaller than the number of couplings ; ( ii ) arbitrarily setting some of the couplings to zero in experimental analysis is in general inconsistent with the electroweak symmetry ; ( iii ) the naive scaling with energy of the form factors is ameliorated by ( @xmath8)-induced cancellations .",
    "therefore , adopting an eft becomes not a matter of choice , but the only way to ensure consistency at the field theoretical level .",
    "the advantages of the eft approach have recently been re - emphasized in @xcite .",
    "global fits to the electroweak data using an eft framework have been performed by several groups in the past .",
    "unfortunately , the global analysis contains too many parameters and cross - correlations are too strong to obtain an informative fit  @xcite . as an alternative ,",
    "the number of coefficients is commonly limited to a reduced set , inspired by the results of different models , and fits have been performed on this basis .",
    "a prototype of this approach is the well - known @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 parameter analysis of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will explicitly show that the above shortcoming of the global fit to eft couplings can be ameliorated by studying individual processes at high energies ( @xmath12 ) . as an example",
    ", we will present a detailed eft - based study of @xmath3 production at linear colliders .",
    "@xmath0 has been the benchmark process in the study of charged triple - gauge corrections first at lep @xcite and subsequently for future linear collider facilities .",
    "@xmath3 production at the lhc has been considered for instance in @xcite .",
    "however , although there have been several studies in the literature emphasizing the need for an eft approach to triple - gauge couplings in @xmath0 @xcite , , a complete analysis is still missing .",
    "the present analysis will be performed in the full nonlinear eft basis recently studied in @xcite .",
    "our final results will provide expressions for the ( initial and final state ) polarized cross - sections in the large-@xmath2 expansion , which is an excellent approximation for the projected energies at future linear colliders .",
    "the leading corrections will grow with @xmath2 relative to the standard model results , reflecting the fact that the nonlinear effective theory violates unitarity in the uv .",
    "the @xmath13 enhancement at energies where the eft is still valid , improves the visibility of small new physics coefficients .",
    "actually , the new physics effects at , say , @xmath14  gev could be typically as large as @xmath15 .",
    "one of the interesting properties of @xmath0 is that , up to tiny mass corrections , it is independent of couplings to a physical higgs sector .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case by comparing our results with the linear eft basis of @xcite . besides the results for the cross - sections ,",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    * despite the sizable number of operators contributing to the process at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , the final result for new physics effects in the large-@xmath2 limit can be encoded in terms of just three parameters .",
    "these can be expressed as the corrections to the left and right - handed gauge - fermion vertices .",
    "* three of the gauge - fermion operators and the three leading ( c , p and cp - conserving ) triple - gauge operators are related by field redefinitions .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath0 , omitting the gauge - fermion operators is not an approximation but an exact field - theoretical result : they can be traded for triple - gauge operators and vice versa , depending on the chosen operator basis .",
    "we stress that this is because only three independent gauge - fermion couplings enter the process @xmath0 .",
    "in general , there are many more gauge - fermion operators and it is not possible to eliminate all of them .",
    "the last point above implies that statements about gauge - fermion or triple - gauge operators _ per se _ are basis - dependent and therefore ill - defined .",
    "for instance , in the basis where gauge - fermion operators are kept , the electroweak fit  @xcite does not support the common claim that they are tightly constrained .",
    "furthermore , our analysis contradicts the statement that @xmath3 production directly tests triple - gauge corrections .",
    "rather , what one finds is that at large-@xmath2 one can put bounds on gauge - fermion couplings or _ equivalently _ on triple - gauge couplings , since they are not independent .",
    "the existence of field - theoretical relations binding gauge - fermion , triple - gauge and oblique operators raises the question of which basis should be preferred for experimental analyses of electroweak physics . in the particular case of @xmath0",
    "the possibility of eliminating the gauge - fermion operators altogether might suggest itself .",
    "however , in view of the general electroweak fit , it seems more natural to eliminate triple - gauge operators and keep the full set of gauge - fermion operators .",
    "as we will show , the emerging picture in this basis turns out to be rather simple : only a single triple - gauge operator appears ( @xmath16 in ( [ oxu ] ) below ) , which is both parity and isospin - breaking , and therefore expected to be numerically small .",
    "additionally , in the large-@xmath2 limit oblique corrections and the surviving triple - gauge operator can be shown to be generically subleading , such that the leading large-@xmath2 contribution naturally singles out gauge - fermion operators .",
    "these rather simple and counterintuitive results follow from carefully eliminating redundant operators and therefore stress the importance of working with a complete and minimal basis in eft - based analyses . comments on how this picture would generalize to hadron colliders",
    "will be made but details will be left to future work .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we will briefly review the eft of the standard model at nlo and fix our notation and conventions . in section  3",
    "we will apply the eft formalism to @xmath0 , discussing in detail direct contributions and parameter redefinitions . in section  4",
    "we collect the results for the differential cross sections for the different initial and final state polarizations .",
    "the issue of redundant operators and choice of basis is addressed in section  5 . a complementary view of the large-@xmath2 limit from the perspective of the equivalence theorem is given in section  6 . in section  7",
    "we discuss the case of a linearly - realized eft . in order to get an estimate of the expected effects at linear colliders , in section  8 the size of eft couplings",
    "is estimated from different benchmark uv completions . in section  9",
    "we briefly comment on @xmath3 production at the lhc .",
    "conclusions are given in section  10 , while technical details are relegated to an appendix .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the well - known leading order chiral lagrangian of the electroweak standard model . to define our notation we quote here the terms of the leptonic sector relevant for @xmath0 .",

    "this lagrangian is non - renormalizable in general , except when a higgs field @xmath32 is introduced with specific couplings , in which case the theory reduces to the conventional standard model ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . in the general case",
    ", additional terms will arise beyond the lowest order from the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking at the @xmath33 scale .",
    "these subleading terms were first considered in .",
    "a complete list of all nlo operators in this framework based on a systematic power counting has recently been given in @xcite .",
    "using the notation of this paper , the nlo operators relevant for @xmath0 can be written as @xmath34 with operators @xmath35 specified in ( [ ob1 ] )  ( [ owi ] ) .",
    "the complete basis of nlo operators @xcite also contains the terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which could in principle contribute to @xmath0 . due to the chirality flip in the electron",
    "current the coefficients of these operators can be expected to be proportional to the yukawa coupling of the electron and thus very much suppressed .",
    "in addition , the chirality - changing currents do not interfere with the vectorial currents of the leading - order amplitude .",
    "those operators therefore give no first - order correction to the @xmath0 cross sections and we have omitted them from ( [ lnloco ] ) .",
    "we have included the 4-fermion operator @xmath38 , which contributes only indirectly through the renormalization of the fermi constant @xmath39 .",
