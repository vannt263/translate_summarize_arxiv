    "it turns out that nondominated sorting is equivalent to finding the longest chain in a partially ordered set , which has a long history in probability and combinatorics  @xcite .",

    "pde - based ranking _ was proposed for approximate nondominated sorting of large datasets .",
    "the basic idea is to estimate the density @xmath7 from a ( relatively small ) subset of @xmath5 , and then use the numerical solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation as an approximation of nondominated sorting .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that pde - based ranking is substantially faster than nondominated sorting in relatively low dimensions , while maintaining high levels of sorting accuracy . the numerical scheme for used in @xcite",
    "is based on backward finite differences and can be solved very efficiently in a single pass . due to the fact that information flows along coordinate axes in the definition of nondominated sorting , this scheme is upwind ( or monotone ) , and convergence of the scheme was established in @xcite .    although the scheme used in @xcite is simple and efficient , it suffers from poor accuracy , with formal rates of convergence on the order of @xmath1 for a grid with spacing @xmath18 in dimension @xmath0 . in this paper",
