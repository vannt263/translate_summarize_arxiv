    "since the first results of the _ kepler _ mission were published , the number of known planet candidates has enlarged tremendously .",
    "most _ hot jupiters _ have been found in single planetary systems and it was believed that those kind of giant , close - in planets are not accompanied by other planets ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this result has been obtained analysing 63 _ kepler _ hot jupiter candidates and is in good agreement with inward migration theories of massive outer planets , and planet  planet scattering that could explain the lack of additional close planets in hot jupiter systems .",
    "nonetheless , wide companions to hot jupiters have been found , as shown e.g. in @xcite for the hat - p-13 system .",
    "one has to state , though , that the formation of hot jupiters is not yet fully understood ( see @xcite and references therein for some formation scenarios , and e.g. @xcite for possible tests ) .",
    "recently @xcite reanalysed a larger sample of 159 _ kepler _ candidates and in some cases found dynamically induced _ transit timing variations ( ttvs)_. if the existence of additional planets in hot jupiter systems can be confirmed , planet formation and migration theories can be constrained .",
    "since , according to @xcite , there is only a small fraction of hot jupiters believed to be part of a multiplanetary system , it is important to analyse those systems where an additional body is expected .",
    "in contrast to e.g. the kepler mission , where a fixed field on the sky is monitored over a long time span , our ongoing study of ttvs in exoplanetary systems only performs follow - up observations of specific promising transiting planets where additional bodies are suspected .",
    "the targets are selected by the following criteria :    * the orbital solution of the known transiting planet shows non - zero eccentricity ( though the circularization time - scale is much shorter than the system age ) and/or deviant radial velocity ( rv ) data points  both indicating a perturber . *",
    "the brightness of the host star is @xmath6mag to ensure sufficient photometric and timing precision at 1 - 2 m telescopes . *",
    "the target location on the sky is visible from the northern hemisphere .",
    "* the transit depth is at least 10 mmag to ensure a significant detection at medium - sized , ground - based telescopes . *",
    "the target has not been studied intensively for ttv signals before .",
    "our observations make use of the yeti network ( young exoplanet transit initiative ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a worldwide network of small to medium sized telescopes mostly on the northern hemisphere dedicated to explore transiting planets in young open clusters . this way",
    ", we can observe consecutive transits , which are needed to enhance the possibility to model ttvs as described in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we are able to obtain simultaneous transits observations to expose hidden systematics in the transit light curves , like time synchronization errors , or flat fielding errors .    in the past , the transiting exoplanets wasp-12b @xcite , wasp-3b @xcite , wasp-10b @xcite , wasp-14b @xcite and tres-2 ( raetz et al . 2014 , submitted ) have been studied by our group in detail . in most cases , except for wasp-12b , no ttvs could be confirmed .",
    "recently , also @xcite claimed to have found possible ttv signals around qatar-1 .",
    "however , all possible variations should be treated with reasonable care .    in this project",
    "we monitor the transiting exoplanet hat - p-32b .",
    "the g0v type @xcite host star hat - p-32 was found to harbour a transiting exoplanet with a period of @xmath7d by @xcite .",
    "having a host star brightness of @xmath8mag and a planetary transit depth of @xmath4mmag the sensitivity of medium - sized telescopes is sufficient to achieve high timing precision , therefore it is an optimal target for the yeti telescopes .",
    "the rv signal of hat - p-32 is dominated by high jitter of @xmath9ms@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite claim that a possible cause of the jitter is the presence of one or more additional planets. @xcite also analysed the rv signature of hat - p-32 and found a long term trend indicating a companion with a minimum mass of @xmath11m@xmath12 at separations of @xmath13au .",
    "however , such a companion could not yet explain the short time - scale jitter as seen in the hartman data .",
    "besides the circular orbit fit , an eccentric solution with @xmath14 also fits the observed data .",
    "though @xcite mention that the probability of a real non - zero eccentricity is only @xmath15 , it could be mimicked or triggered by a second body in the system .",
    "thus , hat - p-32b is an ideal candidate for further monitoring to look for transit timing variations induced by a planetary companion .",
    "between 2011 october and 2013 january we performed 30 complete and 15 partial transit observations ( see tables  [ tab : h32completeobservations ] and [ tab : h32partialobservations ] ) from 10 different observatories : our own one in jena , as well as from telescopes at torun ( poland ) , trebur ( germany ) , gettysburg and swarthmore ( usa ) , tenerife and sierra nevada ( spain ) , antalya and ankara ( turkey ) , and rozhen ( bulgaria ) mostly throughout the yeti network @xcite .",
    "in addition , three literature data points from @xcite , and two observations from @xcite are available .",
    "the telescopes and abbreviations used hereafter are summarized in table  [ tab : h32telescopes ] , a short description of each observing site can be found below , sorted by the number of observations .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we presented our observations of hat - p-32b planetary transits obtained during a timespan of 24 months ( 2011 october until 2013 october ) .",
    "the data were collected using telescopes all over the world , mainly throughout the yeti network .",
    "out of 44 started observations we obtained 24 light curves that could be used for further analysis .",
    "21 light curves have been obtained that could not be used due to different reasons , mostly bad weather .",
    "in addition to our data , literature data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were also taken into account ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : h32oc ] , [ fig : h32ar ] , [ fig : h32k ] , and [ fig : h32i ] and table  [ tab : fitresults ] ) .    the published system parameters @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the circular orbit fit of @xcite were confirmed . in case of the semimajor axis over the stellar radius and the inclination",
    ", we were able to improve the results due to the number of observations .",
    "as for the planet - to - star radius ratio , we did not achieve a better solution for there is a spread in the data making constant fits difficult .",
    "in addition , @xcite found an m - dwarf @xmath16 away from hat - p-32 and hence a possible cause for this spread .",
    "regarding the transit timing , a redetermination of the planetary ephemeris by @xmath4ms can explain the obtained mid - transit times , although there are still some outliers .",
    "of course , having 1@xmath17 error bars , one would expect some of the data points to be off the fit .",
    "nevertheless , due to the spread of data seen in the o  c diagram , observations are planned to further monitor hat - p-32b transits using the yeti network .",
    "this spread in the order of @xmath5min does not exclude certain system configurations .",
    "assuming circular orbits even an earth mass perturber in a mean motion resonance could still produce such a signal .",
    "ms would like to thank the referee for the helpful comments on the paper draft .",
    "all the participating observatories appreciate the logistic and financial support of their institutions and in particular their technical workshops .",
    "ms would also like to thank all participating yeti telescopes for their observations .",
