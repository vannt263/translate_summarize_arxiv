    "flavor conversions of neutrinos emitted from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) represent a diagnostic tool to get crucial information about their mixing parameters and the sn dynamics in the deepest stellar regions  @xcite . in particular , sne are a unique laboratory to probe neutrino oscillations in extreme conditions .",
    "supernova neutrinos can interact not only with the stellar medium via the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite , but also with other neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) and antineutrinos ( @xmath3 ) as well .",
    "it was pointed out that large @xmath0 densities in the deepest stellar regions can result in significant coherent @xmath0@xmath0 forward scatterings  @xcite .",
    "a few years ago it was discovered that @xmath0 self - interactions can give rise to collective @xmath0 flavor oscillations inside the sn  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the most important observational consequence of this collective behavior is a swap of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spectra with the non - electron @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra in certain energy ranges  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that `` spectral splits '' at the edge of each swap interval would be observable in the high - statistics @xmath0 signal from the next galactic sn , allowing to get crucial information about the unknown @xmath0 mass ordering ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "self - induced oscillation effects crucially depend on the inner boundary conditions fixed for the further flavor evolution .",
    "indeed , these non - linear flavor conversions are associated to instabilities in the flavor space , that develop around the crossing points in the energy spectra of the different @xmath0 species ( where @xmath1 and @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "the number and the position of the crossing points depend on the ordering of the original sn @xmath0 fluxes .",
    "since this latter can change during the different post - bounce stages , significant temporal variations are expected in the pattern of the spectral splits  @xcite .",
    "an important layer of complication in this description is associated to the the current - current nature of the @xmath0-@xmath0 weak - interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that the interaction energy between neutrinos of momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the neutrino velocity  @xcite . in a non - isotropic medium",
    "this velocity - dependent term would not average to zero , producing a different refractive index for neutrinos propagating on different trajectories .",
    "this is the origin of the so - called `` multi - angle effects , '' which in some case can dramatically affect the development of the self - induced flavor conversions , producing a quick flavor decoherence  @xcite or suppressing flavor conversions otherwise possible for an a isotropic neutrino emission  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the presence of the ordinary matter background would cause a multi - angle suppression of the collective oscillations , when the matter density dominates over the neutrino one  @xcite .",
    "this situation is expected to occur during the early times accretion phase  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of multi - angle effects is then a key - ingredient to obtain a realistic description of the self - induced neutrino flavor conversions . in this context , it is expected that the @xmath0 angular distributions at emission would play an important role in determining the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction strength . until recently numerical simulations for the sn @xmath0 flavor conversions have been based on the so - called `` bulb model '' ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) , where @xmath0 s of different species are considered as emitted `` half - isotropically '' ( i.e. with all outward - moving angular modes equally occupied and all the backward - moving modes empty ) by a common spherical `` neutrinosphere , '' in analogy with a blackbody emission .",
    "however , realistic supernova simulations show that @xmath0 angular distributions at decoupling are far from being half - isotropic and , above all , are flavor - dependent ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of non - trivial angular distributions was claimed in  @xcite to produce a novel multi - angle instability in the self - induced flavor evolution of a toy model of @xmath0 gas .",
    "however , that conclusion was based on an analysis performed with a small number of angular modes , making challenging to rely on this claim to infer conclusions for the realistic sn @xmath0 case without a dedicated large - scale numerical study .",
    "triggered also by this warning , in  @xcite we performed numerical simulations of the self - induced flavor conversions with non - trival @xmath0 angular distributions , finding remarkable effects on the flavor evolution .",
    "in particular , when flavor - dependent angular distributions lead to crossing points in the angular spectra of different @xmath0 species , a new multi - angle instability can develop , in analogy to the known instability triggered by crossing points in the energy domain .",
    "we find cases in which this multi - angle instability can shift the onset of the flavor conversions toward low - radii and produce a smearing of the splitting features found with trivial @xmath0 emission models . in order to achieve a semi - analytical understanding of the phenomenon , in that letter we proposed to apply to our problem",
    "the linearized stability analysis recently worked out in  @xcite . by seeking an exponentially growing solution in the eigenvalue equations associated with the linearized equations of motion for the neutrino ensemble , this method allowed us to determine the onset of the flavor conversions . in a specific scenario , we compared the growth of this mode in the half - isotropic case with different cases with non - trivial @xmath0 angular distributions , finding a significant enhancement of the instability in these latter cases .    the purpose of this follow - up work is to take a closer look to the multi - angle instability , triggered by non - trivial angular distributions .",
    "in particular we aim to use the stability analysis to perform an investigation on the dependence of this effect on the initial sn @xmath0 flux ordering , and on the @xmath0 mass hierarchy .",
    "here is the plan of our work . in sec .",
    "[ setup ] we introduce the setup for the flavor - stability analysis , describing the non - linear equations for the @xmath0 flavor evolution in sne , and the consistency equations coming from their linearization . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] we present our models for the supernova neutrino emission for cases with a different flux ordering and angular distributions . for these different cases",
    "we show the results of the stability analysis in the two neutrino mass hierarchies . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we comment on our results and we conclude .",
    "our main goal is to perform a numerical stability analysis for the cases studied in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the same setup followed in that paper .",
    "in particular , we work in a two - flavor oscillation scenario , associated to the atmospheric mass - square difference @xmath13  ev@xmath14 and and with the small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath15 . since we aim at isolating the effect of the multi - angle instability , associated with @xmath0 non - trivial angular distributions , we assume in the following that self - induced flavor conversions are not matter suppressed ( as expected instead at @xmath16  s after the core bounce ) , ignoring the ordinary matter background in the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , also when we will consider neutrino spectra representative of the accretion phase ( at @xmath17  s after the core bounce ) we will neglect the matter term in order to isolate only the effect of the angular instability .",
    "however , it has been found in  @xcite that taking realistic angular distributions during the accretion phase and a dominant matter term , self - induced flavor conversions would be completely inhibited .",
    "conversely , we checked that the sub leading matter term during the cooling phase ( at @xmath18  s after the core bounce ) would have a minor impact on the flavor instability associated with the non - trivial angular distributions .",
    "if we denote with @xmath19 the angle of a given neutrino trajectory with respect to the radial direction , flux conservation implies that that it will depend on the radial coordinate @xmath20 even for straight line propagation ( as we consider here ) .",
    "it is thus convenient to parameterize every angular mode in terms of its emission angle @xmath21 relative to the radial direction of the neutrinosphere , that here we schematically fix at @xmath22  km .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect possible residual scatterings that could affect @xmath0 s after the neutrinosphere , producing a small `` neutrino halo '' that would broaden the @xmath0 angular distributions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is expected that this effect may be relevant only at early times , where self - induced conversions would be matter suppressed  @xcite . for a half - isotropic distribution",
    "the occupation numbers are distributed as @xmath23 , or equivalently the radial fluxes are distributed as @xmath24  @xcite . a further simplification is obtained if one labels the different angular modes in terms of the variable @xmath25 , as in  @xcite . note that for an half - isotropic emission at the neutrinosphere the @xmath0 angular distribution of the radial fluxes is a box spectrum in @xmath26 , since @xmath27 which cancels the @xmath28 dependence previously mentioned . at a radius @xmath20 , the radial velocity of a mode with angular label @xmath29 is @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "following  @xcite , we write the equations of motion for the flux matrices @xmath31 as function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the diagonal @xmath31 elements are the ordinary number fluxes @xmath32 integrated over a sphere of radius @xmath20 .",
    "we normalize the flux matrices to the total @xmath5 number flux @xmath33 at the neutrinosphere .",
    "conventionally , we use negative @xmath34 and negative number fluxes for anti - neutrinos .",
    "the off - diagonal elements , which are initially zero , carry a phase information due to flavor mixing .",
    "then , the equations of motion read  @xcite @xmath35 \\,\\",
    "\\label{eq : eom1}\\ ] ] with the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath36 in which we neglected matter effects .",
    "the matrix @xmath37 of neutrino mass - squares causes vacuum flavor oscillations and the term at second lines represents the @xmath0-@xmath0 refractive term . in particular , the factor proportional to the neutrino velocity @xmath38 in the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction term implies `` multi - angle '' effects for neutrinos moving on different trajectories  @xcite . in order to properly simulate numerically this effect",
    "one needs to follow a large number @xmath39 $ ] of interacting @xmath0 modes .      in order to perform the stability analysis",
    "we closely follow the prescriptions presented in  @xcite and summarized in the following .",
    "firstly , we switch to the frequency variable @xmath40 so that @xmath41 and we introduce the neutrino flux difference distributions @xmath42 defined as @xmath43\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\theta(-\\omega)\\left[f_{\\nu_x}(e(\\omega),u)-f_{\\overline\\nu_e}(e(\\omega),u)\\right]\\bigg\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] normalized to the total @xmath5 flux at the neutrinosphere . whenever referring to numerical values for the variables @xmath44 we shall implicitly quote them in km@xmath45 , as appropriate for the sn case .",
    "note that @xmath46 is defined also for negative @xmath47 , where it represents the difference of fluxes in the antineutrino sector in the opposite ordering .",
    "then , we write the flux matrices in the form  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is conserved and then irrelevant for the flavor conversions , and the initial conditions for the `` swapping matrix '' in the second term on the right - hand side are @xmath50 and @xmath51 . self - induced flavor transitions start when the off - diagonal term @xmath52 exponentially grows .    in the small - amplitude limit @xmath53 , and at far distances from the neutrinosphere @xmath54 , the linearized evolution equations for @xmath52 in inverted mass hierarchy ( ih , @xmath55 ) assume the form  @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 quantifies the `` asymmetry '' of the neutrino spectrum , normalized to the total @xmath5 number flux .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction strength is given by @xmath58 one can write the solution of the linear differential equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : stab ] ) ] in the form @xmath59 with complex frequency @xmath60 and eigenvector @xmath61 . a solution with @xmath62 would indicate an exponential increasing @xmath52 , i.e. an instability .",

    "we remark that energy and angular distributions of sn @xmath0 s entering @xmath75 are not independent of each other . however , schematically we assume that the angular distributions are energy independent . then , we can factorize the @xmath0 flux of each flavor as @xmath76 the @xmath0 number @xmath77 is expressed in terms of the @xmath0 luminosity @xmath78 and of the @xmath0 average energy @xmath79 of the different species .",

    "[ fig10 ] ( dash - dotted curve ) starts at a slight larger radius , i.e. @xmath163  km .",
    "this delay is probably due to the time needed by the instability to grow significantly after it starts .",
    "this is related to the value of @xmath139 that is relatively small in this case . in the case",
    "@xmath97 ( dotted curves ) @xmath156 is further reduced with respect to the previous cases , while @xmath142 is enhanced .",
    "both the functions have a similar peak @xmath164 , but @xmath142 has a longer tail with a value close to the peak one , while @xmath156 abruptly drops at zero for @xmath165  km .",
    "therefore , in this case the onset is determined by @xmath142 . since the instable frequencies , determined by the resonance condition [ eq .  ( [ eq : res ] ) ]",
    "would be in the infrared range ( i.e. @xmath166 ) for @xmath167 , the onset of relevant flavor conversions corresponds to this value of @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath168 km , as visible in the numerical evolution ( dotted curve ) .",
    "finally , in the case @xmath98 ( continuous curve ) , the instability associated with @xmath156 disappears , while the one associated with @xmath142 is further enhanced , reaching as peak value @xmath169 .",
    "this time the resonance condition reaches infrared frequency modes for @xmath170 , corresponding to an onset of the flavor conversions at @xmath171 km .",
    "note that in this case the numerical evolution ( continuous curve ) the @xmath122 starts to vary earlier , around @xmath172 km , but it rises significantly only at @xmath173 km , as predicted by the stability analysis .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows : in the latter two cases , since the @xmath139 function presents a rather flat behavior in @xmath119 , the determination of the onset of the flavor conversions in less accurate . indeed ,",
    "also the numerical evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows that the @xmath122-component presents a slower rise time at the onset of the conversions .",
    "self - induced flavor conversions for sn neutrinos are associated to instabilities in the flavor space .",
    "recently , a linearized stability analysis of the sn @xmath0 equations of motion has been proposed as diagnostic tool to track the emergence of these instabilities  @xcite . in our work",
    "we have applied this technique to study the multi - angle instability associated with non - trivial neutrino angular distributions , extending the results presented in  @xcite to different sn @xmath0 flux orderings and @xmath0 mass hierarchies .",
    "we confirm that enhanced instabilities can occur , when the angular spectra present crossing points . also , the onset of the flavor conversions typically shifts toward small radii , with respect to the half - isotropic case .",
    "we can not but emphasize that neutrino angular distributions should be taken into account in supernova neutrino phenomenological studies .",
    "for example , as pointed out in  @xcite , one can expect a smearing of the splitting features observed in the half - isotropic case , with resulting @xmath0 fluxes showing less significant spectral differences .",
    "this tendency toward spectral equalization would challenge the detection of further oscillation signatures , like the ones associated with the earth crossing of sn @xmath0 s ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . on the other hand , a sufficiently low - radii onset on the flavor conversions",
    "might imply an interesting impact on the @xmath20-process nucleosynthesis in sne  @xcite . eventually , if @xmath0 oscillations develop too close to the neutrinosphere , they might invalidate the @xmath0 transport paradigm in sne that ignores @xmath0 conversions .",
    "it is clear that future , state - of - the - art predictions of the neutrino flavor evolution in sne would require as accurate as possible input from hydrodynamical simulations , providing the flavor , angular , energy and time structure of the fluxes .",
    "here we showed that a preliminary flavor stability analysis presents some key advantages over a brute force numerical integration .",
    "while such a perturbative analysis can not be used to deduce the eventual fate of the neutrino ensemble in flavor space , it can be useful to identify the situations where angular distributions play a role in the flavor evolution .",
    "once these cases are identified , it would be mandatory to perform large scale numerical simulations of the complete flavor evolution in order to determine the final oscillated neutrino spectra . with current level of sophistication in sn simulations",
    ", we believe that such studies will be mandatory to achieve a better characterization of the non - linear neutrino flavor evolution during a stellar gravitational collapse and a more realistic description of the neutrino signal from a future galactic sn .",
    "we acknowledge nicolas bourbaki for useful discussions . we thank georg raffelt and irene tamborra for reading the manuscript and for interesting comments on it .",
