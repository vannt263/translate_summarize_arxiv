    "zee observed that the addition of a charged singlet and additional higgs doublets to the standard model particle spectrum resulted in radiatively generated neutrino mass at the one - loop level  @xcite .",
    "it was consequently noted that if only one doublet couples to the leptons , the mass matrix takes a simple form and produces one mass eigenstate much lighter than the other two  @xcite .",
    "babu studied the neutrino spectrum obtained when one retains zee s charged singlet and adds a doubly charged singlet  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the neutrinos develop a mass matrix at the two - loop level , which contains one massless eigenstate , to lowest order .",
    "the mass matrix depends on an integral over the undetermined loop momenta of the two - loop diagram responsible for the neutrino mass , for which babu gave an approximate form .",
    "we present the exact calculation of this integral .",
    "the analytic evaluation of related integrals , occurring when doublet neutrinos acquire mass at the two - loop level via the exchange of @xmath0 bosons in the presence of singlet neutrinos  @xcite , can be found in  @xcite .    in sec .",

    "the leading terms of this integral are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : leading_terms ] for the relevant hierarchies of mass parameters involved .",
    "babu s model  @xcite includes two @xmath1 singlet higgs fields ; a singly charged field and a doubly charged field .",
    "the addition of these singlets gives rise to the yukawa couplings : @xmath2 where and .",
    "gauge invariance precludes the singlet higgs fields from coupling to the quarks .",
    "the higgs potential contains the terms : @xmath3 which violate lepton number by two units and give rise to neutrino majorana mass contributions at the two - loop level ( see figure  [ fig : babus_two_loop_diagram ] ) .",
    "the neutrino masses are calculable and to lowest order the mass matrix takes the form : @xmath4 where with for and for .",
    "@xmath5 are the charged lepton masses and : @xmath6 if one defines : @xmath7 where no summation is implied by the repeated indices , the mass matrix may be written as @xmath8 .",

    "what follows , the exact calculation of the integral @xmath11 is performed and the asymptotic behaviour for the cases and is presented .",
    "note that the hierarchy is a phenomenological constraint , whilst the relative size of @xmath12 and @xmath13 is not predetermined .",
    "after performing a wick rotation and letting @xmath15 , the integral @xmath11 may be written as : @xmath16 where the momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 are now euclidean four - vectors .",

    "it is possible to express @xmath11 as a linear combination of integrals with less than five propagators .",
    "one may use partial fractions to obtain relations like : @xmath23 which may be applied to @xmath11 to give : @xmath24 at this point one may proceed to evaluate the integral @xmath25 to determine @xmath11 but it is preferable to express @xmath11 as a combination of integrals of the form @xmath26 ( where @xmath26 is shorthand for @xmath27 ) .",
    "if one evaluates integrals of the form @xmath25 by introducing feynman parameters , some of the ultraviolet divergences are transferred from the radial integrals in momentum space to the feynman parameter integrals .",
    "it is easier to handle the divergences when evaluating @xmath26 , as they may be completely contained in the momentum space integrals .",
    "integrals of the type @xmath25 have been considered in  @xcite and single integral representations have been obtained  @xcite .    to express @xmath25 in terms of integrals of the form @xmath26",
    "one may use the partial @xmath17 operation of t  hooft  @xcite .",
    "essentially one inserts the identity expression : @xmath28 into the integrand of @xmath25 , performs integration by parts and rearranges the resulting expressions to obtain the relationship : @xmath29 we note that equation ( [ partial_p ] ) is defined for integral @xmath22 , but the resulting relationship may be analytically continued to non - integral @xmath22 .",
    "using equation ( [ mmm_to_mmmm ] ) on @xmath11 gives :    @xmath30+m_{d}^{2}\\left[(2m_{d}|m_{h}|m_{k})-(2m_{d}|m_{c}|m_{k})\\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mkern310mu + \\",

    "the expression ( [ my_form_of_f ] ) can be shown to be equivalent to : @xmath44 which is the symmetrized version obtained in  @xcite .",
    "for numerical evaluation via mathematica etc , it may be more convenient to use the form ( [ my_form_of_f ] ) . if one uses ( [ f_ab ] ) for arbitrary masses it is possible for the logarithms to go negative , thus producing a non - zero imaginary component for @xmath38 . by judicious logarithmic branch choice",
    "one can ensure that the imaginary components of @xmath38 cancel , whilst the real part of @xmath38 is independent of the branch choices .",
    "this real part is always in agreement with the form ( [ my_form_of_f ] ) of @xmath38 , but in the latter the imaginary parts cancel when using the principal branch for all dilogarithms . the result for @xmath11 will ultimately be a combination of functions of the form @xmath38 .",
    "as @xmath11 is evaluated in the neutrino rest frame , it is not possible to cut the two - loop diagram it represents and obtain an energy- and momentum - conserving sub - graph ( ie the neutrino at rest does nt have enough energy for the internal particles to be real and on the mass shell ) .",
    "thus the amplitude for the graph must be real  @xcite , forcing the function @xmath38 to be real .",
    "equation ( [ mm_mone_mtwo ] ) together with either ( [ f_ab ] ) or ( [ my_form_of_f ] ) gives the final result for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath11 is now obtained by substituting the result for @xmath31 into the expression ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) .",
    "inspection of ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) shows that we may use @xmath45 when evaluating @xmath11 , as the constants and logarithms with massive arguments occurring in @xmath31 cancel amongst the terms with a given mass coefficient .",
    "we now find the asymptotic behaviour for the cases and .",
    "the dominant terms are found by using the expansions for @xmath31 presented in  @xcite .",
    "utilising the symmetry properties of @xmath31 and the structure of the expression ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) for @xmath11 allows one to obtain the leading terms relatively easily .      in the expression for @xmath11 , equation ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] )",
    ", we may safely neglect the terms with lepton mass coefficients .",
    "the terms with coefficient @xmath47 have the form @xmath48 and the expansion for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , given in  @xcite , may be used .",
    "all constants and logarithms of @xmath51 may be ignored as they cancel amongst the various terms .",
    "the expansion is given in terms of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . by noting the form of ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) and",

    "any terms which contain a lepton mass will be suppressed , meaning the term @xmath57 dominates .",
    "defining @xmath58 and using @xmath49 in  @xcite , keeping only the terms containing both @xmath55 and @xmath56 , gives : @xmath59\\left\\{h^{2 } + 4h^{3}\\right\\ } + .... \\right\\}.\\label{khh_large_k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all the terms with a coefficient @xmath60 in @xmath11 have the form @xmath61 and will be expanded in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the form of ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) shows that any term in an expansion depending only on @xmath62 ( not including the cross terms when @xmath64 ) will occur in another expansion with a relative minus sign . if @xmath65 is a lepton mass , the leading contributions from @xmath61 will contain factors @xmath63 and consequently be suppressed .",
    "thus to leading order : @xmath66 using the expansion of @xmath67 for @xmath68 from  @xcite and noting the above gives : @xmath69 as the leading terms which contribute to @xmath11 . combining the expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath57 and noting the appropriate coefficients from equation ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] )",
    "gives : @xmath71 where the lepton masses have been neglected relative to the scalar masses in the factors @xmath72 .",
    "babu s approximate form reproduces the @xmath73 term of ( [ i_cd_large_k ] ) in the @xmath74 limit .",
    "it is necessary to retain both @xmath70 and @xmath57 to obtain the leading terms of ( [ i_cd_large_k ] ) .",
    "the leading terms of @xmath11 may be obtained by setting but one may not take @xmath75 when @xmath76 as @xmath11 develops an infra - red singularity .",
    "this singularity is seen to manifest itself in the leading terms of equation ( [ i_cd_large_k ] ) as a logarithmic singularity in the limit .",
    "the terms with lepton mass coefficients may again be neglected to obtain an expansion in terms of @xmath78 .",
    "the presence of the factors in ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) means that the terms with coefficient @xmath47 will be suppressed relative to those with coefficient @xmath60 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath79 for @xmath80 in  @xcite may be used for @xmath70 where only terms originating in the @xmath38 portion , as defined in ( [ mm_mone_mtwo ] ) need be retained .",
    "the result is : @xmath81 for @xmath82 , contributions from the terms @xmath61 , where @xmath65 is a lepton mass , must be included .",
    "the leading terms are those which do not contain factors @xmath83 .",
    "the expansion for @xmath49 with @xmath84 in  @xcite is again employed . retaining only those contributions which stem from @xmath38",
    "gives : @xmath85 with this expression holding for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "using ( [ hhk_large_h ] ) and ( [ hxk_large_h ] ) and neglecting terms with coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath47 in ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) , gives the result : @xmath89 thus for large @xmath60 the leading term is : @xmath90 the @xmath91 factor is expected on dimensional grounds and in this limit the coefficient of @xmath91 contains no logarithmic singularities .",
    "we see that the dominant terms for @xmath11 , when @xmath82 , are found by considering the terms with coefficient @xmath60 in ( [ i_cd_vanderbij_expressions ] ) . at higher order in @xmath92 contributions from the terms with coefficient @xmath47",
    "will also become important .",
    "note that ( [ leading_i_large_h ] ) is independent of @xmath12 and the lepton masses and that its form may be understood as follows .",
    "define : @xmath93 this corresponds , up to multiplicative factors , to @xmath11 with and when the external momenta @xmath94 is taken to be zero : @xmath95 the integral @xmath96 has been evaluated  @xcite , leading to the result : @xmath97    noting that and comparing ( [ i_mc_md_mk_zero ] ) with ( [ leading_i_large_h ] ) it is seen that the leading term of @xmath11 , for , is simply the result one obtains for @xmath11 when the lepton masses and @xmath12 are taken to be zero ( observe that for @xmath82 we may safely set @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath12 to zero to obtain the leading term as @xmath11 remains infra - red finite in this limit ) .    after completing this work we became aware that the explicit asymptotic terms in equations ( [ i_cd_large_k ] ) and ( [ leading_i_large_h ] ) were given in  @xcite .",
