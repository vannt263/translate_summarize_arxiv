    "pulsars lose their rotational energy in the form of magnetized relativistic winds .",
    "being confined by their environment , these winds produce luminous pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) with shapes and spectra determined by the pulsar emission geometry , magnetic field , and particle energy distribution as well as by the properties of the ambient medium and the motion of the pulsar relative to its surroundings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is particularly true of pulsars still within their natal supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "pwne evolve as they first expand into unshocked sn ejecta , then interact with the snr reverse shock , the hot sn debris , and finally the surrounding interstellar medium ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the pulsar may obtain a high space velocity at birth , move supersonically through its surroundings , and produce a cometary pwn with a bow shock that may be visible in x - rays and optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "a particularly intriguing example of the pwn phenomena is cxou  j061705.3@xmath0222127  ( also known as g189.22@xmath02.90 and as 1saxj0617.1@xmath02221 ; hereafter j0617 ) located at the southern edge of the snr shell ic443  where the shell interacts with a molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this alignment suggests this pwn is entering a rare transitional stage where the overall morphology of the pwn is affected by its interaction with the snr shell . while it shows a distinct cometary structure suggesting supersonic motion @xcite , the pwn is oriented @xmath150  away from the direction expected if the pulsar originated at the center of the ic443  remnant",
    "this casts some doubt as to the physical association of this object and ic443 as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "a hard , non - thermal , x - ray source located in the southern portion of ic443  was first discovered by @xcite with _ asca_. the source was later observed with _",
    "@xcite , with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , and with _",
    "chandra _  for @xmath110",
    "ks using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) i - array @xcite and again for @xmath137.5  ks using the s - array @xcite .",
    "the latter three observations had sufficient angular resolution to study the pulsar and many details of the pwn and surroundings .",
    "all three studies noted the soft thermal spectrum of the central point source is consistent with emission from the surface of a neutron star .",
    "@xcite first identified the comet - shaped morphology of the nebula and argued it could be explained by supersonic motion causing a pulsar wind to terminate in a bow shock and flow downstream in a synchrotron tail .",
    "the deeper observation obtained by @xcite revealed a surface brightness plateau extending to @xmath125  downstream of j0617  which they interpreted as the backward termination shock .",
    "they used the locations of the forward and backward shocks to deduce a low mach number , @xmath11.2 , for the flow and argued this was indicative of motion through relatively hot ( shocked ) supernova debris .",
    "@xcite also identified two compact knots of emission a few arcseconds north and south of j0617 .",
    "@xcite showed that the hard power - law spectrum at the core of the nebula softens with distance from j0617  and is consistent with synchrotron cooling models .    here ,",
    "analysis of a much deeper , @xmath1152  ks , acis s - array observation is presented .",
    "an overview of the observation and data reduction methods is given in section  [ s : dataprep ] followed by analysis of the x - ray morphology , a comparison of the x - ray to optical emission line images , and analysis of the x - ray ( and radio ) spectrum at high spatial resolution ( section  [ s : results ] ) .",
    "the bright source , j0617 , is confirmed to display the physical properties of a pulsar ( though no pulsations are detected ) that powers a bright , cometary - like , roughly 2@xmath61.5  pwn . within",
    "the nebula is a nearly circular , @xmath15  radius , ring of enhanced x - ray emission enclosing a jet - like feature oriented roughly north - south and passing through the position of j0617 .",
    "the results are then interpreted ( section  [ s : discussion ] ) in terms of synchrotron emission from relativistic particles generated by the pulsar and confined by the surrounding medium .",
    "a distance of @xmath7  kpc ( 1@xmath80.42  pc ) to j0617  is adopted following @xcite but note , as pointed out above , there remains some doubt as to the physical association of j0617  and the snr ic443 .",
    "therefore , distances are given in units of @xmath9  kpc where appropriate .",
    "j0617  was observed with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory advanced ccd imaging spectrometer on 2012 february 6 ( obsid 13736 ) for @xmath1107.6  ks and again on 2012 february 8 ( obsid 14385 ) for 44.5  ks .",
    "both observations used an identical instrument configuration which placed j0617  near the back - illuminated ccd ( s3 ) aimpoint .",
    "the observations were taken in full - frame timed exposure mode using the standard 3.2  s frame time and the vfaint telemetry format .",
    "the data were reprocessed using the chandra x - ray center script acis_process_events ( ciao v. 4.5 ) to apply the latest time - dependent gain correction ( caldb 4.5.5 ) and to flag potential cosmic - ray background events .",
    "only events imaged on the back - illuminated ccd s3 are used in this work .",
    "point - like x - ray sources in the field were identified using the source - finding utility in the lextrct image - analysis program @xcite . the locations of sources identified in the two event lists were compared and were found to be in sufficient agreement for most purposes so that the two event lists were simply combined using the ftools utility fmerge to produce a 152  ks duration final event list .",
    "in addition , a sub - pixel image was created by rebinning the events to @xmath10 of the nominal ( 0.492 ) acis pixel size in order to examine the finer details of the x - ray morphology in the immediate vicinity of j0617  ( section  [ s : ring ] ) .",
    "spectral fitting reported here uses the xspec , v.  11.3.2 g , spectral - fitting package @xcite .",
    "spectral redistribution matrices and ancillary response functions were generated using the ciao tools mkacisrmf , mkarf and mkwarf .",
    "spectral analysis is confined to events within the 0.5@xmath118.0  kev energy range .",
    "the energy range spans only 0.5@xmath115.0  kev in those cases where a soft thermal - dominated spectrum produces a negligible number of high - energy source counts as is the case outside the pwn region .    the x - ray surface brightness and x - ray color or hardness ratio vary noticeably across the @xmath18@xmath68  s3 field of view . the ` contour binning ' method of @xcite",
    "was therefore applied to the merged data set in order to map the physical properties , deduced from spectral model fitting , in the regions containing j0617 , its pwn , and portions of the surrounding diffuse thermal plasma .",
    "the contour binning method defines spatial bins ( for spectral analysis ) which cover contiguous regions of similar surface brightness and is motivated by the fact that surface brightness variations often follow changes in physical properties , such as those at shock fronts , in the x - ray - emitting medium .    for this purpose ,",
    "the identified point sources were first removed from an image constructed from the merged event list and back - filled with a sampling of the adjacent background using the ciao tools roi and dmfilth following the diffuse emission science thread .",
    "the resulting image was then accumulatively smoothed using a signal - to - noise ratio threshold of 30 and contour - binned using a signal - to - noise threshold of 100 using the accumulate_smooth and contbin utilities , respectively , from @xcite .",
    "an earlier observation of j0617  ( obsid 05531 ) , taken 2005 january 12 using a similar instrument configuration , is used in analysis of the proper motion of j0617(section [ s : proper ] ) .",
    "the analysis presented here also makes use of h@xmath12  and [ oiii ]  images obtained 23 nov 2012 using the astronomical research cameras e2v 230 - 42 ccd ( @xmath10.493  pixel@xmath5 ) mounted on the 0.9  m southeastern association for research in astronomy telescope at kitt peak observatory .",
    "seeing conditions were @xmath132 .",
    "contemporaneous r and v images were used for continuum subtraction from h@xmath12  and [ oiii ] , respectively .",
    "the continuum - subtracted images were registered to the x - ray data using 2mass objects common to both wavelengths .",
    "archival observations of ic443  at 330  mhz , 4.8  ghz , and 8.4  ghz , obtained with the very large array ( vla ) , were also analyzed and compared to the x - ray data .",
    "all data were calibrated and reduced using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) data reduction package .",
    "multiple 330  mhz observations were carried out from 2005 to 2007 using several vla configurations @xcite so that the final combined image is sensitive to a wide range of spatial structures from @xmath16@xmath14 up to @xmath170@xmath15 and therefore samples both the pwn and the surrounding extended ic443  snr .",
    "see @xcite for further details of the 330  mhz observations and data reduction .",
    "the final combined image has an angular resolution of 17  and a background noise level of 1.7  mjy  beam@xmath5 after correcting for primary beam attenuations .",
    "the average snr contribution in the region surrounding j0617  is 15  mjy  beam@xmath5 .",
    "the 4.8  ghz observation was taken in the c configuration on 1997 august 26 and the 8.4  ghz observation in d configuration on 1997 december 31 .",
    "the 4.8  ghz observation was taken with two 50  mhz tunings centered at 4.8851  ghz and 4.8351  ghz and the 8.4  ghz observation was taken in two 50  mhz bands centered at 8.4351  ghz and 8.4851  ghz . both observations used 3c  138 as the flux calibrator and 0632 + 103 as a phase calibrator .",
    "these observations were first analyzed by @xcite .",
    "these data are only sensitive to structures on scales up to a little over 2@xmath15 and thus are not able to sample the emission over the entire nebula as is possible at 330  mhz . here , they were re - calibrated and reduced using standard data reduction techniques applied within aips .",
    "the data were self - calibrated in two rounds of phase - only calibration . the final , full resolution , 4.8  ghz image rms is 0.18  mjy  beam@xmath5 with a beam size of @xmath15.5@xmath6 3.8  and the 8.4  ghz image rms is 0.076  mjy  beam@xmath5 with a beam size of @xmath18.1@xmath67.1 .",
    "the deep _ chandra _  image ( figure  [ f : fulls3image ] ) reveals j0617  as the brightest point - like object in the field surrounded by a high - surface - brightness nearly - circular ring .",
    "there are two ` spokes ' apparently connecting j0617  to the ring oriented roughly north - south which are possibly pulsar jets . exterior to the ring is a comet - shaped nebula with its major axis oriented @xmath150  east of north and with its apparent forward direction to the southwest .",
    "the cometary nebula has a hard x - ray spectrum as was noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "predominantly soft x - ray emission surrounds the roughly 2@xmath61.5  cometary nebula and extends throughout the s3 field of view ( along with a few faint unrelated point - like sources ) .",
    "the surface brightness of this extended emission is spatially non - uniform varying by factors of 4 to 5 over spatial scales of order 1 . as shown by spectral analysis ( section  [ s : spectra ] ) , this extended diffuse emission is primarily thermal in nature whereas the cometary nebula , ring , and related features are dominated by hard non - thermal spectra .",
    "analysis of these features is discussed in greater detail in the following subsections beginning with an estimate of the proper motion of j0617 .",
    "the current observations were taken 2582@xmath161 days since the 37.5-ks observation obsid 05531 was taken with j0617  at the aimpoint .",
    "an earlier _ chandra _  observation , obsid 00760 , was too short to be useful for precise measurements of proper motion .",
    "four point - like x - ray sources , in addition to j0617 , were identified common to both obsid 05531 and the deeper of the two recent observations , obsid 13736 .",
    "the spectra of three of these four sources have significant fractions of their counts above 2  kev indicating a high relative probability that they are distant background objects and hence fixed on the plane of the sky .",
    "the fourth source is softer and possibly a foreground star .",
    "it is listed in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite with designation 1123 - 0129324 with a negligible proper motion .",
    "offsets ( independently in r.a . and decl . ) between the two observations were computed by minimizing the error - weighted separations among the four sources . after applying these relative astrometric corrections , the 99%-confidence contour extremum sets an upper limit to the proper motion @xmath17310@xmath18  km  s@xmath5 with the best - fit ( but not statistically significant ) direction toward the west . specifically , the estimated motion is @xmath19  mas  yr@xmath5 in r.a . and",

    "figure  [ f : fulls3image ] displays the 2.0@xmath114.0  kev subpixel - sampled region around j0617  including the ring - like and jet - like structures .",
    "this energy range best distinguishes the ring from other features and mutes the contribution from j0617  which is brightest at lower energies ( section  [ s : s_psr ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : subrp ] shows the broad - band surface brightness radial profile centered on the position of j0617 , extending to 12.3 , and including only azimuthal angles between pa 200  and 340  ( @xmath1670  of west ) in order to avoid contributions from the jet - like features .",
    "this profile was obtained from the @xmath10-pixel sampled image . also shown",
    "is a model point spread function for a monochromatic source at 2.5  kev generated using the chandra ray tracer ( chart ) and marx simulation tools .",
    "the ring appears as the peak at 4.8  with a ( gaussian ) width of 1.2 .",
    "these parameters were estimated by fitting the surface brightness profile with a combined power law plus gaussian function .",
    "another peak in the radial profile appears between j0617 and the ring .",
    "this feature is about 1  from j0617   but adding an additional gaussian component shows this feature is not statistically significant .",
    "the jet - like feature spans from the position of the pulsar northward and southward until it appears to intersect the ring .",
    "the ring brightens at these intersections .",
    "these intersections were described as compact emission components by @xcite .",
    "the southern jet feature has a surface brightness about 75% higher than the northern jet in the 0.5@xmath118.0 kev energy range .",
    "the center of the ring is not coincident with the location of j0617 . a spatial model representing an annulus was fit to the sub - pixel x - ray image in the 2@xmath114  kev energy range after ignoring data within a 2.5  radius of the center of the ring ( due to the brightness of the pulsar ) and smoothing the data slightly ( figure  [ f : ring ] ) .",
    "the model consists of two elliptical gaussians plus a constant where one gaussian has a positive amplitude and the other a negative amplitude in order to approximate an elliptical annulus .",
    "the location of the centroid of the ring model is 06@xmath217@xmath305.166@xmath4 @xmath0222128.80 .",
    "this location is offset by 2.7  ( 0.06@xmath18  ly ) from j0617  at pa@xmath1340 , i.e. , the pulsar is roughly sse of the ring center .",
    "the ring is close to circular .",
    "the best - fitting parameters result in an aspect ratio of 0.86@xmath160.05 and an angular eccentricity , @xmath21  deg where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the major and minor gaussian widths .",
    "the pa is 84@xmath163  deg ; the ellipse major axis is nearly in the east - west direction .",
    "figure  [ f : bp ] displays the 0.5@xmath118.0  kev brightness profile along the major axis ( pa 50 ) of the comet - shaped pwn .",
    "the profile has been averaged over a @xmath1630  region perpendicular to this axis .",
    "the peak of the profile coincides with the pulsar and offsets upstream of the pulsar ( toward the southwest ) are taken as positive in this figure .",
    "the ring is clearly visible as secondary peaks on either side of the pulsar .",
    "the profile @xmath245  upstream of the pulsar decreases smoothly out to at least 2  from j0617 without any discernable structural features . as with the upstream profile ,",
    "the downstream profile first declines steeply from the exterior of the ring but then it reaches a broad peak extending from 15  to 25  away from the pulsar .",
    "the profile then declines more slowly out to approximately 2  downstream without any additional features .",
    "the x - ray image does show that the surface brightness distribution upstream of the pulsar is bow - shaped .",
    "parabolas were fit , by visual inspection , to the surface brightness contours in the upstream region of a smoothed image ( with the ordinate axis of the parabolas constrained to be parallel to pa 50 ) as shown in figure  [ f : parabolas ] .",
    "the parabolas are of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance from the location of j0617  ( at the focus ) to the vertex of the parabola .",
    "there is no evidence for a bow shock in either the h@xmath12  or [ oiii ] images of this region and there is little or no correlation between the x - ray emission in the upstream direction with the optical line emission .",
    "however , as a close - up image of the region shows ( figure  [ f : snrimage1 ] ) , there is h@xmath12  emission coincident with the jet - like x - ray feature .",
    "this is likely an accidental coincidence as there are many similar h@xmath12 features throughout the ic443  snr .",
    "similarly , there is also a well - defined h@xmath12  wisp downstream of j0617 that runs roughly along the major axis of the pwn and thins in the downstream direction ( figure  [ f : snrimage1a ] ) .",
    "this feature is also visible in the [ oiii ] image .",
    "there is no x - ray feature correlated with this wisp .",
    "although its location is suggestive , it is unclear if this h@xmath12  wisp is related to the pwn as there are numerous wisps with similar morphology throughout the region that are obviously not related to the pwn proper .",
    "customarily , a background region is selected from those regions remote from the primary source , in this case the pwn , in order to isolate the source spectrum for analysis .",
    "however , j0617  is located along the line of sight through the extended x - ray emission associated with the snr ic443  and this emission is highly non - uniform as noted above .",
    "several regions were visually selected and analyzed to quantify the spectral properties of this `` background '' throughout the field of view of the s3 chip .",
    "these regions are numbered 1 through 9 in figure  [ f : s3bg ] and their spectra are shown in figure  [ f : bgspec ] . assuming this emission is from hot plasma within the snr",
    ", the observed variations may be due to a combination of different plasma temperatures , emission measures , elemental abundances , and intervening absorption .",
    "the simplest model that can account for all these variables in xspec is an absorbed optically - thin thermal plasma model .",
    "the spectral analysis reported in this section is limited to the range 0.5@xmath115.0  kev because of the paucity of source photons above 5  kev .",
    "it was found that the spectra of these ` outlier ' regions can not be fit satisfactorily with a single - component absorbed ( xspec model phabs ) variable - abundance thermal emission ( vmekal ) model . a significant improvement could be made by adding either a second thermal component or a power law ( powlaw ) component .",
    "resulting best - fit model parameters are listed in table  [ t : fitparams2 ] for these outlier fields .",
    "these include the absorption column density , @xmath27 , the power law index , @xmath28 , the thermal component temperature , @xmath29 , the model component normalizations , @xmath30 is in units of flux density , ph  kev@xmath5  @xmath31  s@xmath5 at 1 kev and @xmath32 is in units of @xmath33 times the emission measure , in @xmath34 .",
    "] , the 0.5@xmath115.0  kev flux , @xmath35 , in erg  @xmath31  s@xmath5  ( uncorrected for absorption ) and the @xmath36 fit statistic and number of degrees of freedom , dof . here and elsewhere",
    "errors are 90% confidence extremes for a single interesting parameter unless otherwise noted .    the first thermal component temperature is typically @xmath37 to 0.8  kev .",
    "it was found that the second component usually had a steep power law slope ( photon index @xmath38 ) or only a slightly higher temperature ( @xmath39 to 1.0  kev ) suggesting that this component may represent the range of thermal emission temperatures expected along a given line of sight through the snr rather than a true non - thermal component typically indicated by a power law shape .",
    "this is true of most of these outlier regions except regions 7@xmath119 where @xmath40 ( or @xmath41  kev ) . in these cases , it is likely that there is truly a hard non - thermal component even if the two-@xmath29 model is formally a better fit as such high temperatures are atypical of snr spectra .",
    "the pwn likely contributes this non - thermal emission component in regions 8 and 9 because they are immediately adjacent to the high - surface - brightness pwn .",
    "the elemental abundances were not well constrained in any of these models but strong emission lines of h - like o and ne , and he - like blends of ne , mg , si , s are present throughout as shown in figure  [ f : bgspec ] whereas fe emission is weak .",
    "this is indicative of a type  ii core collapse sn origin .",
    "overall , since the spatial scale of the observed brightness variations are of order 1 , and the spectra of the different regions sampled also vary , none of these regions ( nor any other region on s3 ) can be safely defined as a background to be used in fitting spectra of the pwn .",
    "thus , the `` blank sky '' background appropriate to this observation is the only background used in subsequent spectral analysis with the exception of the pulsar , j0617 , and the jet - like and ring features . for these objects ,",
    "the space between the pulsar and ring is relatively faint and local backgrounds were chosen from this region .",
    "the spectrum of j0617  was extracted from a 2-pixel ( 0.984 ) radius circle centered at the location of the pulsar ( see also figure  [ f : subrp ] ) .",
    "a nearby background was obtained by combining data from five 2-pixel radius circles located interior to the ring and excluding the jet - like features .",

    "each region contains roughly 10@xmath67 x - ray events .",
    "because the extended thermal emission from the ic443  snr is so spatially non - uniform , the contour binning method did not satisfactorily bin the regions beyond the pwn .",
    "the results of model fits to the spectra of these regions are given in table  [ t : fitparams4 ] ( a 3-pixel ( 1.48 ) radius circle centered on j0617  was excluded from the innermost region , denoted region 1 for spectral analysis ; regions 2 through 7 lie sequentially ourward ) .",
    "in addition to model parameters and derived properties listed previously ( table  [ t : fitparams2 ] and  [ t : fitparams3 ] ) , table  [ t : fitparams4 ] includes fluxes , @xmath68 , corrected for absorption along the line of sight . the spectra were fit on the extended 0.5@xmath118.0  kev energy range and fluxes listed in table  [ t : fitparams4 ] are over this same interval .",
    "an absorbed power law model provided a statistically - superior fit to the spectra of the three innermost regions .",
    "an absorbed two - component ( powerlaw and vmekal or two vmekal ) model was needed for the outer zones but one component is always hard ( @xmath69 or @xmath70  kev ) and dominates the 0.5@xmath118.0 kev flux ; again , indicating a true non - thermal component is present as argued in section  [ s : s_bg ] . for this reason ,",
    "the two vmekal component model is not considered further .",
    "the soft thermal component in the two - component non - thermal model is generally cooler , @xmath71  kev , throughout these pwn regions than in the ` outlier ' fields ( section  [ s : s_bg ] ) but note that the soft component contributes at most 5% of the flux in all but the outermost pwn region .",
    "the outermost region is similar to the outlier regions 7@xmath119 ( table  [ t : fitparams2 ] ) in that its soft thermal component temperature is 0.67  kev and its power - law index is @xmath12 . unlike these outlier regions , nearly all the flux in even this outermost pwn region",
    "is provided by the non - thermal model component .    to test the significance of the low temperature in the inner zones",
    ", the fits were repeated with the vmekal model temperature parameter fixed to its value in the outermost zone , @xmath72  kev .",
    "this results in some additional flux in the 1 - 2 kev band which forces the power law index to flatten slightly to compensate .",
    "however , this is only a modest change in slope and within the errors obtained if the thermal model temperature were left as a free parameter .",
    "for example , in the fourth zone , @xmath28 decreases from 1.9@xmath160.1 to 1.8@xmath160.1 .",
    "maps of several of the resulting best - fitting model parameters are displayed in figure  [ f : contbinmap ] for the single - component absorbed powerlaw model .",
    "these maps show that the power law slope smoothly increases with distance from j0617 , that the intensity decreases , and that the best - fitting column density is roughly constant but decreases in the outermost zone .",
    "this latter trend is perhaps influenced by the simplicity of this single - component model .",
    "the x - ray emission in the j0617  pulsar wind nebula is clearly dominated by a non - thermal component suggesting a synchrotron emission source .",
    "radio images of the region @xcite also show a cometary morphology which may imply a similar origin .",
    "however , the radio and x - ray data have much different spatial resolution and sensitivity so that a direct comparison is non - trivial .",
    "specifically , the signal to noise of the higher frequency radio data is too low to allow for measurements in small regions for comparison with the x - ray fluxes . instead , by cutting the upper and lower uv range of the 4.8  ghz and 8.4  ghz measurements to a common @xmath11.7@xmath60.77  region ( see figure  [ f : s3bg ] ) with equal coverage at both frequencies ( and at 330  mhz ) , radio spectral index measurements of roughly the whole j0617  pwn can be obtained .",
    "comparison of the coverage after cutting showed no apparent gaps in the coverage and thus both frequencies should be sensitive to emission over a similar range of spatial scales .",
    "the data were therefore re - imaged and convolved with a circular beam of size 8.5@xmath14 and the images were blanked for emission falling below a three sigma cutoff before measurements were taken of the total flux of this region .",
    "this yields nearly equal fluxes at all three frequencies , 84.3@xmath167.6 , 87.6@xmath163.0 , and 87.0@xmath160.6  mjy at 330  mhz , 4.8  ghz and 8.4  ghz , respectively , and therefore a flat spectral index of @xmath73 in the radio band consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the combined 330  mhz image does not suffer from these sensitivity issues but does not have the high spatial resolution of the x - ray data .",
    "therefore , instead of the contour binning regions of section  [ s : s_pwn ] , a set of successively larger elliptical annuli approximating the innermost five contour binning regions was analyzed at both 330  mhz and x - rays .",
    "as before , the x - ray spectrum is predominantly non - thermal and a single absorbed powerlaw model provided an acceptable fit . here ,",
    "j0617  was _ not _ excluded since it can not be cleanly masked out of the low - resolution radio image .",
    "the 330  mhz radio fluxes were calculated by integrating over each region after subtracting an estimated contribution due to emission from the surrounding snr as noted in section  [ s : dataradio ] .",
    "table  [ t : ellipsesfitpars ] summarizes the geometry and the radio and x - ray properties for these regions .",
    "if the snr - background - subtracted 330  mhz radio flux and the non - thermal ( power - law component ) x - ray emission arise from the same physical mechanism , then their spectral shapes should be simply related .",
    "the slopes of these spectra are obviously different : the radio spectrum , @xmath74 , is flat , at least on average over the entire region , while @xmath75 depending on the ( elliptical ) region . for a power - law x - ray spectrum with a photon index @xmath28 and normalization @xmath76 photons ( cm@xmath64  s  kev)@xmath5 at @xmath78  kev , the energy flux spectrum is @xmath79 .",
    "extrapolation of this x - ray spectrum towards lower frequencies intersects the extrapolation of the radio spectrum , @xmath80 , at frequency @xmath81 when @xmath82 where @xmath81 is in units of ghz and @xmath83 is in mjy .",

    "compared to the nsa model , the blackbody fit of the thermal component gives a higher temperature , @xmath93 k , and a smaller radius , @xmath94 km , similar to the vela pulsar .",
    "such emission could emerge from a hot spot on the neutron star surface heated by precipitation of relativistic particles from the pulsar magnetosphere , or it could reflect strong nonuniformity of the surface temperature due to anisotropy of heat conductivity of the neutron star crust caused by very strong magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the non - detection of pulsations with @xmath53 s does not contradict the small size of the emitting region because such young pulsars have much shorter periods .",
    "since the nsa and blackbody models yield fits of about the same quality , we can not prefer one model to the other based solely on the observations .",

    "thus , if j0617  is within this plasma and not just lying along the same line of sight , then the pulsar motion can not be highly supersonic ; the mach number @xmath131 for @xmath132  km  s@xmath5 . here",

    "assuming , for the present , that j0617  and its pwn are embedded in the ic443  snr , the ambient thermal pressure , @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the ambient mass density , can be estimated with the aid of the vmekal model fit parameters .",

    "young , subsonically - moving pulsars such as the crab , a distinct jet - torus structure may be present near the pulsar related to axial symmetry in the wind caused by rotation of the pulsar .",
    "in other systems , particularly older pulsars moving supersonically through a cold interstellar medium , the pwn structure consists of a forward bowshock and an extended tail .",
    "j0617  appears to have some attributes of both these extremes .",
    "it has a distinct , nearly circular , @xmath15-radius circumstellar ring encircling jet - like features and a @xmath12@xmath61.5  comet - shaped nebula . in analogy to the crab",
    ", the ring may define a termination shock ( ts ) where the ultrarelativistic free - flowing equatorial wind slows to sub - relativistic speeds , referred to as the inner ring in the crab @xcite , or the ring may be a torus of shocked pulsar wind similar to the one that lies some distance beyond the inner ring of the crab .",
    "since in both cases the symmetry axis of the j0617  ring should be the spin axis of the pulsar , the ellipticity of the ring implies the angle @xmath161 between the line of sight and the spin axis is about @xmath162 ( see section  [ s : ring ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the spin axis coincides with the direction of motion , similar to many other pulsars @xcite , and j0617  originated at the center of ic443 , then the pulsar velocity can be estimated as @xmath163600 km s@xmath5 , for @xmath101 and @xmath1643 ( see section  [ s : centralsource ] ) , comparable to the speed of sound in the ambient medium estimated in section  [ s : surround ] .",
    "the relatively small @xmath161 value corresponds to a distance from the snr center to the pulsar of @xmath165 cm .",
    "this requires the snr must be elongated along the line of sight if j0617  is still within the snr .",
    "for instance , if the snr is a prolate spheroid whose polar axis is parallel to the line of sight , then this axis must be a factor of 2 longer than the equatorial radius and the length of the chord through the snr along the line of sight to j0617becomes @xmath166 ( cf .",

    "the north - south jet - like features could be true pulsar jets ( e.g. , similar to the inner jets of the vela pulsar ; * ? ? ? * ) of @xmath167 cm ( deprojected ) length .",
    "the fact that the southern jet is brighter than the northern jet can be explained by the doppler boosting , i.e. , the outflow in the southern jet is approaching the observer , which implies that the pulsar is also approaching and located in the front part of the snr .",
    "the offset of the apparent ring center from the pulsar ( see figure [ f : ring ] ) could be explained similar to that of the crab inner ring @xcite , e.g. , as caused by an intrinsic azimuthal asymmetry due to nonuniformity of the ambient medium or even a simple geometric displacement caused by a non - equatorial ring .    in this interpretation",
    "the observed x - ray pwn beyond the ring is comprised of a shocked pulsar wind outflow .",
    "its cometary shape is formed by the ram pressure caused by the motion of j0617   relative to the ambient medium .",
    "the misalignment of @xmath168 between the symmetry axis of the comet - shaped pwn and the direction toward the snr center could be explained by bulk motion of the snr matter in the vicinity of j0617  with a velocity of a few hundred km s@xmath5 ( e.g. , due east or east - southeast ) .",
    "we should note that the ellipticity of the j0617  ring derived from the image analysis ( section 3.1.2 ) is subject to large systematic uncertainties due to the ring faintness and the ( apparent ) ring - jet intersections .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude the possibility that the true ellipticity is much smaller than @xmath162 , i.e. , the ring is nearly circular . in this case , if we assume that the pulsar s spin axis is aligned with direction of motion , we would have to conclude that j0617  could _ not _ originate at the center of the ic443  snr .",
    "however , if we allow a strong misalignment between the spin axis and the direction of motion ( e.g. , similar to igrj110146103 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the circular shape of the ring would not impose restrictions on the direction of motion and birthplace of the pulsar .",
    "nevertheless , if the jet - like features are indeed the jets , they would lie nearly along the line of sight and would be exceptionally long .",
    "thus , some ellipticity of the ring is required if it is associated with the equatorial pulsar wind .",

    "in the supersonic case , @xmath169 , the shapes of these surfaces ahead of the moving pulsar resemble paraboloids whose sky projections look bow - like if the angle between the pulsar velocity and the line of sight is large enough .",

    "the solution is then the sum of a uniform flow and a radial flow from the pulsar with speed falling as the square of the radius .",
