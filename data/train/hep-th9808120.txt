    "it turns out , however , that there are a few surprises in store .",
    "first of all , the supersymmetry algebra ( eqns ( [ superqplus])-([crossterm ] ) ) is certainly true in a continuum space - time , but there is no obvious reason to expect that these relations should also hold exactly in a discretized version of the theory . from our numerical studies , however , we find that relations ( [ superqplus ] ) and ( [ crossterm ] ) are indeed exactly satisfied in the discretized theory .",
    "a potential problem arises , however , in relation ( [ superqminus ] ) .",
    "first of all , one finds that @xmath72 and @xmath73 do not anti - commute : @xmath74 .",
    "however , this is not too surprising , since one can trace this anomaly to the truncation of momenta ( i.e. there is a non - zero lower bound on @xmath53 ) following from the dlcq procedure . in particular , as we increase the resolution , the non - zero matrix entries in @xmath75 become more and more sparsely distributed , and we expect them to occupy a subset of measure zero in the continuum limit @xmath7 .",
    "this is substantiated by direct inspection of the matrix @xmath75 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "we also encounter a further anomaly when computing the difference @xmath76 . according to relation ( [ superqminus ] ) , this difference is precisely zero in the continuum , but in the discretized theory , it is non - vanishing .",
    "as we discussed above , this can be understood as an artifact of the truncated momenta in the dlcq formulation , and disappears in the continuum limit @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , we should worry at this stage about the definition of the light - cone hamiltonian .",
    "relation ( [ superqminus ] ) suggests that we may define the dlcq light - cone hamiltonian as the square of any one of the supercharges .",
    "because the difference @xmath76 is non - vanishing in the discretized theory , we have two possible choices for defining the light - cone hamiltonian : @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "surprisingly , after diagonalizing each of these operators for different @xmath4 , the spectrum of eigenvalues turns out to be identical !",
    "this is certainly another attractive feature of dlcq that deserves further study . for finite @xmath4",
    ", the operator ` anomalies ' we observed may be gauge equivalent to zero . ] .",
    "of course , this implies that the spectrum of the theory for finite @xmath4 is independent of the choice of supercharge , and therefore well defined",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether other physical observables are independent of the observed anomaly in the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "let us begin with a discussion of massless states .",
    "firstly , for gauge symmetry u(@xmath3 ) , the u(1 ) degrees of freedom explicitly decouple , and this provides trivial examples of massless states , which can be seen in the dlcq analysis .",

    "fock space consists of two parton states only .",
    "moreover , since @xmath69 increases or decreases the number of partons by one , it necessarily annihilates all fock states , and so all states are massless .",
    "however , for @xmath80 , determining the existence ( or not ) of massless states in the su(@xmath3 ) theory turns out to be a highly non - trivial problem involving the full dynamics of the hamiltonian .",

    ", we have identified a series of dlcq solutions that is expected to converge in the limit @xmath7 to a massless bound state .",
    "this continuum solution would rule out the possibility of a mass gap , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we should remark at this point that the fock state representation of the lowest energy states in this model appear to be significantly more complicated than solutions found in other field theories with massless particles  such as the t hooft pion , or schwinger particle .",

    "in contrast , it turns out that any normalizable state in the ( continuum ) supersymmetric model studied here must be a superposition of an infinite number of fock states @xcite .",
    "an analogous situation occurred in the model with @xmath120 supersymmetry @xcite .    finally , we comment on the ` string - like ' nature of bound states that dominate the low energy spectrum .",
    "although we focused on a massless state composed of mainly two - parton fock states , one can always find a massless bound state dominated by fock states with an arbitrarily large number of partons for sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "the structure of the low energy spectrum is similar , consisting of bound states of all lengths permitted by the truncation parameter @xmath4 .",
    "such qualitative features of the spectrum were exhibited also in the @xmath120 supersymmetric model @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have performed a detailed analysis of the dlcq bound state spectrum of an @xmath11 supersymmetric matrix model , which may be heuristically derived by dimensionally reducing @xmath10 super - yang - mills from four to two space - time dimensions .",
    "the gauge group is su(@xmath3 ) , and we allow @xmath3 to be finite , but arbitrarily large .",
    "we discretize the light - cone supercharges via dlcq , and find that certain supersymmetry relations are exactly satisfied even in the discretized formulation . in particular , relations ( [ superqplus ] ) and ( [ crossterm ] )",

    "we find , however , that relation ( [ superqminus ] ) holds only approximately , although the discrepancy diminishes as the resolution @xmath4 is increased . as a consequence ,",

    "surprisingly , however , the eigenvalues of @xmath121 and @xmath122 turn out to be _ identical _ at any resolution , and so the dlcq spectrum of the theory has an unambiguous definition as the eigenvalues of either supercharge squared . with this definition ,",
    "the dlcq spectrum turns out to be _ exactly supersymmetric at any resolution _ ( see tables [ k3masses ] and [ k4masses ] , for example )",
    ". it would be desirable to understand why  in the dlcq formulation  the supersymmetry operator algebra is only approximately satisfied , while the spectrum itself appears to reflect unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "perhaps the observed anomaly in the algebra cancels for physical observables , @xmath123 , for appropriate matrices @xmath124 , so that relation ( [ superqminus ] ) holds exactly even in the discretized theory .",
    "however , this would imply a non - vanishing result for relation ( [ crossterm ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it would be tempting to argue that this non - vanishing contribution ( or ` central charge ' ) reflects the topology induced by compactification of the light - like circle in dlcq @xcite .",
    "] , which would be consistent with the idea that certain quantities are ` gauge equivalent ' to zero .    in table [ k5masses ] , we illustrate the dependence of bound state masses on the number of gauge colors @xmath3",
    ". convergence is evident at large @xmath3 if we keep @xmath125 constant .",
    "we also resolve mass splittings in the spectrum as a result of @xmath54 interactions ( see table [ k5masses ] ) .",
    "it appears that decreasing @xmath3 ( i.e. increasing the strength of the @xmath54 interactions ) has the generic effect of decreasing particle masses , except for very light particle states .",
    "note that there is no @xmath3 dependence of the spectrum at resolutions @xmath82 and @xmath126  one needs to consider @xmath89 to observe any variation with @xmath3 .    in figure [ one ]",
    ", we plotted the dlcq spectrum for resolutions @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and observed that the supersymmetric spectrum approaches a dense subset of the positive real axis .",
    "this is compatible with the recent claim that the theory is in a screening phase @xcite .    by carefully studying the fock state content of certain bound states at different resolutions , we argued for the existence of a normalizable massless state in the continuum limit @xmath7 . a mass gap is therefore expected to be absent in this theory .",
    "we also observed that the low energy spectrum is dominated by states with arbitrarily many partons  a constituent picture involving few - parton fock states is obviously an inadequate representation for capturing the full low energy dynamics of this model .    in the light of this highly complex bound state structure ,",
    "it is tempting to suggest that we are probing a dynamical system that might be more adequately ( and simply ) described by an effective field theory in higher dimensions . following the remarkable proposals of matrix theory and the ads / cft correspondence",

    "it is now straightforward to verify that @xmath146 and @xmath147 project out the left and right - moving components of the four - component spinor @xmath132 . defining @xmath148 by a rescaling , @xmath149 ,",
    "we introduce left / right - moving spinors @xmath150 as follows : @xmath151 this decomposition is particularly useful when working with light - cone coordinates , since in the light - cone gauge one can express the left - moving component @xmath152 in terms of the right - moving component @xmath153 by virtue of the fermion constraint equation .",
    "we will derive this result shortly . in terms of the usual four dimensional minkowski space - time coordinates ,",
    "the light - cone coordinates are given by @xmath154 note that the ` raising ' and ` lowering ' of the @xmath17 indices is given by the rule @xmath155 , while @xmath156 for @xmath13 , as usual .",
    "it is now a routine task to demonstrate that the yang - mills action ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath157 where the repeated indices @xmath18 are summed over @xmath158 .",
    "some surprising simplifications follow if we now choose to work in the _ light - cone gauge _ @xmath159 . in this gauge @xmath160 , and so the ( euler - lagrange ) equation of motion for the left - moving field @xmath152 is simply @xmath161 which is evidently a non - dynamical constraint equation , since it is independent of the light - cone time .",
    "we may therefore eliminate any dependence on @xmath152 ( representing unphysical degrees of freedom ) in favor of @xmath153 , which carries the eight physical fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "in addition , the equation of motion for the @xmath34 field yields gauss law : @xmath162 where @xmath163 + 2\\psi_{r}^t\\psi_{r}$ ] , and so the @xmath34 field may also be eliminated to leave the two bosonic degrees of freedom @xmath164 , @xmath13 .",
    "note that the two fermionic degrees of freedom exactly match the bosonic degrees of freedom associated with the transverse polarization of a four dimensional gauge field , which is of course consistent with the supersymmetry .",
    "we should emphasize that unlike the usual covariant formulation of yang - mills , the light - cone formulation here permits one to remove _ explicitly _ any unphysical degrees of freedom in the lagrangian ( or hamiltonian ) ; there are no ghosts , and supersymmetry is manifest .",
