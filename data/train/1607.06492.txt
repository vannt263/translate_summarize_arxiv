    "negative index materials ( nims ) were investigated theoretically by veselago in @xcite and the existence of such materials was confirmed by shelby , smith , and schultz in @xcite .",
    "the study of nims has attracted a lot attention in the scientific community thanks to their many potential applications .",
    "mathematically , the study of nims faces two difficulties .",
    "first , the equations modeling nims have sign changing coefficients ; hence the ellipticity and the compactness are lost in general . secondly , the localized resonance , i.e. the fields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others as the loss goes to 0 , might appear .",
    "three known applications of nims are superlensing and cloaking using complementary media and cloaking a source via anomalous localized resonance ( alr ) . superlensing using complementary media",
    "was suggested by veselago in @xcite for a slab lens ( a slab of index @xmath1 ) using the ray theory .",
    "later , cylindrical lenses in the two dimensional quasistatic regime , the veselago slab lens and cylindrical lenses in the finite frequency regime , and spherical lenses in the finite frequency regime were studied by nicorovici , mcphedran , and milton in @xcite , pendry in @xcite , and ramakrishna and pendry in @xcite respectively for dipoles sources . superlensing using complementary media for arbitrary objects in the acoustic and electromagnetic settings",
    "was established by nguyen in @xcite for related schemes . cloaking using complementary media",
    "was suggested and investigated numerically by lai et al . in @xcite .",
    "this was established rigorously for related schemes by nguyen in @xcite for the quasi - static regime and later extended by nguyen and ( h. l. ) nguyen in @xcite for the finite frequency regime . cloaking a source via alr",
    "was discovered by milton and nicorovici in @xcite for constant radial symmetric plasmonic structures in the two dimensional quasi - static regime .",
    "their work has root from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where the localized resonance was observed and established for such a setting .",
    "later , cloaking a source via alr was studied by milton et al . in @xcite ,",
    "bouchitte and schweizer in @xcite , ammari et al . in @xcite ,",
    "kohn et al in @xcite , , nguyen and ( h. l. ) nguyen in @xcite in which special structures were considered due to the use of the separation of variables or the blow up of the power was investigated via spectral theory or variational method . in @xcite ,",
    "nguyen investigated cloaking a source via alr for a class of complementary media called the class of doubly complementary media for a general core - shell structure . in these works ,",

    "milton and nicorovici in @xcite questioned that whether or not the structure @xmath0 in @xmath38 would cloak small objects nearby in two dimensional quasistatic regime .",
    "various numerical simulations on this effect were reported by bruno and lintner in @xcite ; even though the cloaking effect is still mysterious and questionable . in this paper ,",
    "the guest of milton and nicorovici was confirmed ( theorem  [ thm - cs-1 ] ) and similar phenomena are observed and analyzed in the finite frequency regime in both two and three dimensions ( theorems  [ thm - cs-1-k ] and [ thm - main - g ] ) .",
    "as mentioned , the plasmonic structures used in theorem  [ thm - cs-1 ] and [ thm - cs-1-k ] can be used in lens devices using nims .",
    "more generally , it is established in @xcite that doubly complementary media can act like lenses . in this paper",
    ", we showed that they might become a cloak for small but finite size objects near by .",
    "thus the results presented here show that the modification given in @xcite from the suggestions in @xcite is necessary to ensure the superlensing property ; otherwise , a lens can become a cloak ( see section  [ sect - cm - superlensing ] ) .",
    "in the same spirit , we as well show that it is necessary to modify the scheme of cloaking using complementary media suggested in @xcite as done in @xcite ( see section  [ sect - cm - cloaking ] ) .",
    "the analysis in this paper is on one hand based on the use of reflecting and removing singularity techniques introduced in @xcite and on the other hand involves a new type of three spheres inequality with  partial data \" and the use of conformal maps in two dimensions .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present various schemes of cloaking an arbitrary objects via anomalous localized resonance and provide their analysis in two and three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this is a way to cloak an object using negative index materials in which the cloaking device is independent of the object . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we show that in two dimensional quasistatic regime an annular plasmonic structure @xmath0 cloaks small but finite size objects near by . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss its connections with superlensing and cloaking using complementary media . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we confirm the possibility that a lens can act like a cloak and conversely . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility was raised about a decade ago in the literature .    </S>",
