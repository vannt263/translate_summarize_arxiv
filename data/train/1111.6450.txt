    "following the recent experimental success with artificial gauge fields and spin - orbit coupled atomic bose gases  @xcite , there has been increasing theoretical interest in studying spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gases with balanced or imbalanced populations , at zero or finite temperatures , in two or three dimensions , etc .",
    "the main motivation behind these works is that the spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gases are ideal systems for studying topologically - nontrivial superfluid phases  @xcite , with the possibility of featuring majorana zero - energy bound states for which the associated quasiparticle operators are self - hermitian .",
    "this means that a zero - energy majorana quasiparticle is its own anti - quasiparticle .",
    "although these quasiparticles are predicted to appear in low - dimensional strongly - correlated systems in various fields of physics , including the fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite , chiral two - dimensional superconductors  @xcite , chiral two - dimensional @xmath0-wave superfluids  @xcite , three - dimensional topological insulator - superconductor heterostructures  @xcite one - dimensional nanowires  @xcite , spin - orbit coupled semiconductor - superconductor heterostructures  @xcite , etc . , it has proved to be very difficult to realize them in these systems .",
    "given that the cold atom systems offer unprecedented control in comparison to condensed matter ones , there is a good chance of creating and observing majorana quasiparticles with atomic systems in the near future .",
    "the first step in searching for the majorana quasiparticles with spin - orbit coupled fermi gases is to understand the phase diagram of these systems , which has recently been worked out within the mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the ground - state phase diagram of a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling at unitarity , i.e. when the two - body scattering length @xmath1 between pseudo - spin components in vacuum diverges , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "there are three phases in the phase diagram  @xcite . while the normal ( n ) phase is characterized by a vanishing superfluid order parameter , the uniform superfluid and nonuniform superfluid , e.g. phase separation ( ps ) , are distinguished by their thermodynamic stability when the order parameter is nonzero .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the topologically - trivial gapped superfluid ( sf ) phase , the gapless superfluid ( gsf ) phase can be distinguished by the momentum - space topology of its excitations . depending on the number of zero - quasiparticle excitation energy regions in momentum space , there are two topologically - distinct gapless phases . for the rashba - type spin - orbit coupling shown here , while gsf(ii ) has four zero - energy points , gsf(i )",
    "has only two .",
    "the phase diagram illustrates that the spin - orbit coupling counteracts the population imbalance , and that this competition tends to stabilize the gsf phase against ps .",
    "the anisotropic nature of the spin - orbit coupling ( in momentum space ) is also found to stabilize exotic superfluid phases .",
    "for instance , in sharp contrast to the @xmath2 case where only the gapless superfluid phase supports population imbalance , both the gapless and gapped superfluid phases are found to support population imbalance .",
    "although rashba - type spin - orbit coupling is considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , the topological structure shown here is quite robust against the effects of anisotropic spin - orbit couplings  @xcite .",
    "[ htb ]    since majorana quasiparticles appear in the presence of topological defects , e.g. vortices , domain walls , boundaries between bulk phases , etc .",
    ", one of the exciting experimental directions with spin - orbit coupled fermi gases may be to create and observe a majorana zero - energy quasiparticle bound to a vortex .",
    "for this purpose , in this paper , we consider a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling , and use the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) formalism to analyze a single vortex line along a finite cylinder with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "we find signatures for the appearance of core- and edge - bound states in various observables , most notable of which is the counterflow of pseudo - spin particle - current densities near the edge of the cylinder .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we generalize the bdg formalism to spin - orbit coupled fermi gases in sec .",
    "[ sec : bdg ] , and then derive the self - consistency equations for a single vortex line in sec .",
    "[ sec : vortex ] .",
    "we present the numerical solutions in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , where we discuss the effects of spin - orbit coupling on the superfluid order parameter , particle density , energy spectrum , bound - state wave functions , single - particle density of states , and probability - current density .",
    "our conclusions are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the results mentioned above are obtained by solving the self - consistent bdg equations , suitably generalized to spin - orbit coupled fermi gases . before presenting our numerical results ,",
    "let us first present the theoretical framework of this formalism .      in this paper",
    ", we use the mean - field hamiltonian density ( in units of @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 describing two - component fermi gases with attractive and short - range interactions . here , the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 create and annihilate a pseudo - spin @xmath7 fermion at position @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath9 is the mean - field superfluid order parameter .",
    "furthermore , the operator @xmath10 is the kinetic energy , where @xmath11 is the mass and @xmath12 is the chemical potential of @xmath7 fermions , and the operator @xmath13 is the spin - orbit coupling , where @xmath14 is its strength and @xmath15 is the momentum operator .",
    "although we keep the formalism quite general , we present numerical calculations only for the mass - balanced fermi gases with @xmath16 .    in the presence of a spin - orbit coupling",
    ", this hamiltonian can be diagonalized via the generalized bogoliubov - valatin transformations , @xmath17 , $ ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the amplitudes , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the operators corresponding to the creation and annihilation of pseudo - spin @xmath7 quasiparticles , respectively . the resultant bdg equation can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23\\ ] ] is the hamiltonian matrix given in the @xmath24^t $ ] basis , and @xmath25 are the energy eigenvalues . since the bdg equations do not depend on @xmath26 , it is sufficient to solve only for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "using the bogoliubov - valatin transformations , the mean - field superfluid order parameter @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the strength of the attractive interaction between @xmath32 and @xmath33 fermions , and @xmath34 is the thermal average , becomes @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the fermi function and @xmath37 is the temperature . as usual , we relate the interaction strength @xmath38 to the two - body scattering length @xmath1 between an @xmath32 and a @xmath33 fermion in vacuum via the relation , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is twice the reduced mass of an @xmath32 and a @xmath33 fermion , @xmath41 is the volume of the sample and @xmath42 is the kinetic energy .",
    "this leads to @xmath43 , $ ] where @xmath44 is the energy cutoff used in the @xmath45-space integration ( to be specified below in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] ) .    to determine @xmath12",
    ", the order parameter equation has to be solved self - consistently with the number equations @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the local density of @xmath7 fermions .",
    "using the bogoliubov - valatin transformations , we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "$ ] having generalized the bdg formalism to spin - orbit coupled fermi gases , next we apply it for a single vortex line .",
    "in particular , we consider a single vortex line positioned along a finite cylinder of radius @xmath49 and length @xmath50 , and with a periodic boundary condition in the @xmath51 direction , in such a way that the order parameter can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the cylindrical coordinates @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "note in this coordinate system that the spin - orbit coupling term becomes @xmath56 , $ ] showing that the single vortex line has rotational invariance around the @xmath51 axis , so that the solutions of the bdg equation have a well - defined planar angular momentum @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath57 is a good quantum number .",
    "in addition , the system is assumed to have translational invariance along the @xmath51 direction , i.e. @xmath58 momentum is also a good quantum number .",
    "thus , for a singly - quantized vortex line considered in this paper , we may choose the normalized wave functions as @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the @xmath32 components , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the @xmath33 ones .",
    "here , @xmath63 is the wave vector along the @xmath51 direction with @xmath64 . this particular choice ( which is not unique  @xcite ) allow us to decouple the bdg equations into independent subspaces of @xmath65 sectors .",
    "we further project the radial wave functions onto a set of bessel functions normalized in a disc of radius @xmath49  @xcite , i.e. @xmath66 , $ ] where @xmath67 and the argument @xmath68 is the @xmath69th zero of @xmath70 .",
    "more explicitly , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the @xmath32 radial wave functions , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the @xmath33 ones , and they already satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath75 at the edge of the cylinder .    using the orthonormality condition @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the kronecker delta , this procedure reduces the bdg equation given in eq .",

    ", we also obtain the total number of @xmath7 fermions as @xmath89 .",
    "$ ] we emphasize that these mean - field equations can be used for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath90 at low @xmath37 , but they provide only a qualitative description of the system outside of the weak - coupling regime , i.e. in the bcs - bec crossover . in this paper",
    ", we set the temperature to zero , and consider a strongly - interacting fermi gas at unitarity , i.e. @xmath91 , as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "in our numerical calculations , we set a large energy cutoff @xmath92 , and numerically solve the self - consistency eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : bdg.matrix])-([eqn : ne.down ] ) at @xmath93 . here",
    ", @xmath94 is a characteristic fermi - energy scale where @xmath95 is the fermi momentum corresponding to the bulk value of the total density of fermions , i.e. @xmath96 at the bulk .",
    "we also choose @xmath97 as the radius and @xmath98 as the length of the cylinder , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 as the maximum quantum numbers .",
    "note that @xmath101 in order to be consistent with the energy cutoff . since the presence of a single vortex line can not significantly effect the bulk parameters , we first solve @xmath12 and @xmath102 self - consistently for a vortex - free thermodynamic system , and then use these solutions as an input for our vortex - line calculation , where @xmath102 corresponds to the bulk value of @xmath103 .",
    "here , we assume @xmath103 is real without losing generality .      in fig .",

    "we see that @xmath103 increases with increasing @xmath90 , e.g. its bulk value increases from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , and that the effect of spin - orbit coupling is similar to the effect of increased interaction strength .",
    "this is due to the increased density of states with increasing @xmath90 , and it is consistent with the previous results on thermodynamic systems  @xcite .",
    "[ htb ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](b ) , we show the corresponding density profiles @xmath111 for the same parameters . when @xmath2 , it is well - known for the fermion superfluids that the density is depleted near the vortex core compared to its bulk value  @xcite , and that the depletion increases with increasing interaction strength toward the molecular bec side .",
    "this is because the energy separation between the vortex core - bound states increases with increasing @xmath102 which makes them less occupied .",
    "in fact , for a population - balanced fermi gas , the density depletes fully and becomes zero at the vortex core in the molecular bec limit , consistent with the theory of weakly interacting atomic bose gases .",
    "however , for population - imbalanced fermi gases , the vortex core may still be filled with excess fermions toward this limit  @xcite . when @xmath112 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](b ) , we again see that the effect of spin - orbit coupling is similar to the effect of increased interaction strength , i.e. density depletion also increases for both @xmath7 components with increasing @xmath90 . to further understand the density depletions ,",
    "next we analyze the spectrum of energy eigenvalues .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , the spectra of energy eigenvalues @xmath113 are shown as a function of planar angular momentum @xmath57 for the @xmath114 sector .",
    "the spectrum rapidly becomes symmetric around @xmath115 with increasing @xmath116 , since the vortex core and edge states disappear when @xmath117 .",

    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) corresponds to a topologically - nontrivial gapless bulk gsf phase ( see the thermodynamic phase diagram given in fig .  [",
    "fig : pd ] ) .",
    "first of all , we note that the excitation spectra shown in these figures have the necessary symmetry @xmath119 , which follows from the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , a second branch of continuum spectra appears in both cases and on both positive and negative energy regions when @xmath120 .",
    "this is similar to what happens in a thermodynamic system , for which the excitation spectrum has two quasiparticle and two quasihole branches when @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "[ htb ]    when @xmath2 , the positive- and negative - energy spectra are connected by a single branch of discrete andreev - like bound states  @xcite . while the visible discreteness of the continuum spectrum is a finite - size effect and the spectrum becomes continuous only in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath121 ) , the discreteness of the bound states is insensitive to the system size since these states are strongly localized around the vortex core .",
    "the lowest - energy quasiparticle excitation requires a minigap of order @xmath122 . when @xmath112 , the energy spectrum of the sf phase shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) is very similar to the usual population - balanced @xmath116-wave superfluids , for which the bulk energy spectrum is also gapped .",
    "there are only a few discrete core - bound states appearing within the bulk energy gap in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) , since the bulk order parameter @xmath123 is quite large for @xmath124 leading also to a large minigap",
    ". however , the bulk order parameter decreases to @xmath125 when @xmath106 , leading to a smaller minigap in comparison to @xmath124 case , and hence a larger number of core - bound states as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) .",
    "in contrast , we see a major difference in the energy spectrum of the gsf phase as shown in fig .  [ fig : spectrum](b ) .",
    "in addition to the branch of discrete core - bound states that is also present in the sf phase , there is a second branch of bound states which are strongly localized around the edge of the cylinder .",
    "these states result from andreev scattering at the rigid walls of the cylinder , and their spectrum is linear in energy within the continuum gap  @xcite .",
    "we find that the lowest positive - energy and highest negative - energy bound states have @xmath126 and @xmath114 , and their energies are @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "this is not a coincidence since we know that the energy spectrum has @xmath119 symmetry , and given that the spectrum is expected to have a two - fold degenerate zero - energy bound states , i.e. a pair of majorana quasiparticles , in the thermodynamic limit , they must occur at @xmath126 .",
    "however , hybridization between the core- and edge - bound states ( see below ) lifts this degeneracy in a finite system , and the zero - energy bound states split in energy as we find here .",

    "( due to particle - hole symmetry , the radial wave functions for the highest negative - energy bound state with energy @xmath132 can simply be obtained by changing @xmath133 and vice versa . )",
    "we note that while the wave functions have @xmath134 symmetry near the vortex core , they have @xmath135 symmetry near the edge .",
    "these are consistent with the symmetries of majorana quasiparticles  @xcite , for which the associated quasiparticle operators are self - hermitian , i.e. a majorana quasiparticle is its own anti - quasiparticle .",
    "this is clearly seen from the bogoliubov - valatin quasiparticle creation operator @xmath136 $ ] evaluated at @xmath126 and @xmath114 . since the majorana quasiparticles always come in pairs , they appear simultaneously but away from each other in real space . in our single vortex line , while one of them is mostly localized at the vortex core , the other one is mostly localized at the edge , with some degree of hybridization between them due to finite - size effects .",
    "the hybridization is clearly seen in the wave functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] .",
    "we note that due to this coupling between the majorana core- and edge - bound states , their two - fold @xmath137 degeneracy is lifted , causing a small level splitting as discussed above . increasing the separation between majorana core- and edge - bound states , i.e. when @xmath121 , weakens the hybridization such that both bound states eventually become degenerate in energy with @xmath137 . when this happens , the core quasiparticle is well - localized around the vortex core with @xmath134 symmetry , and the edge quasiparticle is well - localized around the edge with @xmath135 symmetry , without any hybridization between the two .",
    "so far , we have established a major difference between the energy spectra of sf and gsf phases , which is mainly due to the appearance of edge- and majorana zero - energy bound states , and this difference leaves its signatures in various observables as discussed next .      for instance , the local single - particle density of @xmath7 states @xmath138 , $ ] where @xmath139 is the delta function , as well as the integrated single - particle density of @xmath7 states @xmath140 provide direct evidences for the existence of edge- and majorana zero - energy bound states as shown below . in particular , for a vortex line , and after using the orthonormality conditions for the bessel functions , @xmath141 reduces to @xmath142.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use a small spectral broadening ( @xmath143 ) to regularize the delta functions in our numerical calculations .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we see that while the density of states vanishes around @xmath145 in the sf phase , due to the presence of a gap in the energy spectrum , it is finite in the gsf phase with very small peaks around @xmath145 .",
    "these peaks are due to the presence of discrete core and edge states within the continuum gap in energy , and they are most clearly seen in the majority ( @xmath32 ) component .",
    "we also note that the appearance of a second continuum branch in the excitation spectrum increases the density of states considerably when @xmath146 .",
    "next , we analyze the local probability - current density of @xmath7 fermions , which also shows signatures for the edge- and majorana zero - energy bound states .",
    "similar to the usual @xmath2 treatment , the quantum mechanical probability - current operator for @xmath7 fermions can be identified from the continuity equation .",
    "while the presence of a spin - orbit coupling leads to additional terms in the total particle current operator , these terms do not contribute to the current since the expectation value @xmath147 .",

    "to conclude , we considered a rashba - type spin - orbit coupled fermi gas , and used the bdg formalism to analyze a single vortex line along a finite cylinder with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "when the populations of the pseudo - spin components are sufficiently imbalanced , depending on the strength of the spin - orbit coupling , we showed that core- and edge - bound states as well as majorana zero - energy quasiparticles appear in the energy spectrum .",

    "while preparing this work , we became aware of a closely related work  @xcite , where the vortex core and edge states are analyzed for a trapped two - dimensional fermi gas .",
    "for the most parts , our work is consistent with their findings .",
    "however , in contrast to our finite - cylinder setup , where the system is either in an sf or a gsf phase , depending on the parameter regime , both sf and gsf phases may also coexist in a trap in different regions .",

    "<S> it has recently been shown that the spin - orbit coupling gives rise to topologically - nontrivial and thermodynamically - stable gapless superfluid phases when the pseudo - spin populations of an atomic fermi gas is imbalanced , with the possibility of featuring majorana zero - energy quasiparticles . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling , and use the bogoliubov - de gennes formalism to analyze a single vortex line along a finite cylinder with a periodic boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the signatures for the appearance of core- and edge - bound states can be directly found in the density of single - particle states and particle - current density . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the pseudo - spin components counterflow near the edge of the cylinder , the strength of which increases with increasing spin - orbit coupling . </S>"
