    "a key aspect that motivated this review is the question whether _ ground level enhancement ( gle ) _ events , which apparently require acceleration processes that produce @xmath0 gev particles , originate from flare regions in the solar corona or from shocks driven by coronal mass ejections propagating through the corona and interplanetary space .",
    "gle events represent the largest _ solar energetic particle ( sep ) _ events that accelerate gev ions with sufficient intensity so that secondary particles are detected by ground - level neutron monitors above the galactic cosmic - ray background ( lopate 2006 ; reames 2009b ) .",
    "a catalog of 70 gle events , occurring during the last six solar cycles from 1942 to 2006 , has been compiled ( cliver et al .",
    "1982 ; cliver 2006 ) , which serves as the primary database of many gle studies .",
    "so , gle events are very rare , occurring only about a dozen times per solar cycle , which averages to about one event per year .",
    "while gle events with 1 gev energies represent the largest energies produced inside our solar system , they are at the bottom of the cosmic ray spectrum , which covers an energy range of @xmath1 ev , exhibiting a `` spectral knee '' between particles accelerated inside our galaxy ( @xmath2 ev ) and in extragalactic sources ( @xmath3 ev ) .",
    "while coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are widely considered as the main drivers of geoeffective phenomena , as pointed out in the so - called `` solar flare myth '' paradigm ( gosling 1993 ) , the acceleration site of high - energy particles detected in - situ in the heliosphere can often not unambiguously be localized , and thus we have to consider both options .",
    "several timing studies of gle events have shown evidence for multiple ( impulsive and gradual ) components , so there is often not a simple dichotomy of acceleration sites . in order to address our central question whether gev particles producing gle events are either of solar or of heliospheric origin",
    ", we will review various aspects of flare observations of gle events , such as the relative timing of the release of gle - associated particles during solar flares ( section 2.1 ) , prompt flare - associated acceleration of gle protons ( section 2.2 ) , the maximum energies of gamma - ray producing particles in solar spectra ( section 2.3 ) , the height of acceleration regions ( section 2.4 ) , the magnetic topology of solar flare acceleration regions ( section 2.5 ) , and the role of extended acceleration phases and particle trapping in solar flares ( section 2.6 ) .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 3 .",
    "complementary aspects of the same question from the view of cme - associated shocks are treated in the article of gang li , and active region characteristics of gle - associated flares are reviewed by nariaki nitta in this volume .",
    "all gle events are associated with solar flares of the most intense category , i.e. , goes x - class flares in most cases , althouth there are exceptions , e.g. , see the 1979 august 21 event ( cliver et al .",
    "1983 ) or the 1981 may 10 event ( cliver 2006 ) . at the same time , _ coronal mass ejections _",
    "( cme ) were reported in all recent cases .",
    "thus we can say that flares and cmes are both necessary conditions for a gle event , but it leaves us with the ambiguity where the acceleration of gev particles reponsible for gle events takes place . in the following we investigate and review various observational aspects of relevant flare data that could shed some light into this question .      for the analysis of the timing of gle events we are using initial solar release times that are normalized to the earth - arrival times of electromagnetic signals , based on the compilation of 16 events during 1997 - 2006 ( gopalswamy et al .  2010",

    "the spectrum is fitted with a combination of primary electron bremsstrahlung and pion - decay radiation .",
    "note that pion decay is dominant at energies @xmath4 mev ( mandzhavidze & ramaty 1992).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    do these highest observed energies constrain or rule out any acceleration mechanism ?",
    "for dc electric field acceleration in sub - dreicer fields , the maximum velocity to which electrons can be accelerated is limited by the value of the dreicer field , which depends on the density and temperature of the plasma , @xmath5 ( statvolts @xmath6 ) .",
    "holman ( 1996 ) argues that electron energies up to @xmath7 mev can be attained for high densities of @xmath8 @xmath9 and low temperatures @xmath10 mk ( yielding a dreicer field of @xmath11 statvolt @xmath6 , i.e. , 3 v m@xmath12 ) , if electrons are continuously accelerated over a current channel with a length of @xmath13 mm .",
    "the requirement for such large - scale dc electric fields , however , conflicts with the observed time - of - flight delays of hard x - ray pulses ( e.g. , aschwanden et al .  1996 ) and the short inductive switch on / off time scales required for the observed subsecond hard x - ray pulses .",
    "alternatively , litvinenko ( 1996 ) envisions super - dreicer electric fields , which can generate arbitrarily high maximum electron energies within much smaller spatial scales , and thus can be consistent with the time - of - flight delays of the observed hard x - ray pulses .",
    "the maximum energy for relativistic electrons obtained over an acceleration time @xmath14 is approximately , @xmath15 litvinenko ( 2003 ) identifies plausible physical conditions with super - dreicer fields of order @xmath16 v m@xmath12 in reconnecting current sheets that lead to electron acceleration with gamma - ray energies of a few 10 mev in electron - rich flares or to the generation of protons with energies up to several gev in large gradual flares .",
    "a similar acceleration model was applied to the gle event # 59 on 2000 jul 14 ( li et al .  2007 ) .",
    "also stochastic acceleration can generate 10 mev electrons and 1 gev protons ( miller et al .",
    "1997 ) , if a sufficiently high wave turbulence level is assumed ( which , however , can not easily be constrained by observations ) . thus , the maximum observed gamma - ray energies imply only constraints for the acceleration mechanism of sub - dreicer electric dc fields , but not for super - dreicer dc electric field , stochastic , or shock acceleration mechanisms .",
    "since we have a temporal coincidence of gle particle acceleration with respect to flare hard x - ray emission in at least 50% , we turn now to the question of the spatial localization of acceleration sources .",
    "one method to estimate the height of the acceleration region of gle particles ( reames 2009a , b ) is based on an assumed height @xmath17 of the start of radio type ii bursts , corrected for the propagation delay of the cme shock front with speed @xmath18 during the time interval @xmath19 between the start @xmath20 of the radio type ii burst and the solar particle release time @xmath21 , @xmath22 which is always higher than @xmath17 , because @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "reames ( 2009a , b ) assumed a nominal average height of @xmath25 solar radii based on standard coronal density models @xmath26 and statistical start frequencies of type ii bursts around @xmath27 mhz ( kundu 1965 ) , which corresponds to an electron density of @xmath28 @xmath9 in the case of fundamental plasma emission , i.e. , @xmath29 . taking the propagation delay of @xmath30 min and the cme speeds of @xmath31 km s@xmath12 into account ,",
    "reames ( 2009a , b ) arrived at estimated heights of @xmath32 solar radii , with a possible dependence on the heliographic longitude .",
    "this method implicitly assumes that particles are accelerated in cme shocks , whose location is entirely tied to the height and propagation speed of the type ii and cme shock front .",
    "ms are shown in the bottom left panel , yielding a time - of - flight distance of @xmath33 mm , which is projected onto the inferred loop geometry ( top right panel ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the tof distance is derived from varying the filter time scale ( bottom right panel ) , ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1996).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    alternatively , since half of the gle events exhibit a starting time @xmath21 during the impulsive phase of hard x - ray emission , we can estimate the height of their acceleration region from the hard and soft x - ray data .",
    "the mildly relativistic electrons accelerated in a flare exhibit a time - of - flight delay between their coronal acceleration site and the chromospheric target region where bright hard x - ray emission is observed , depending on their kinetic energy . from the velocity dispersion of these energy - dependent hard x - ray time delays , the propagation distance and height of the acceleration region can be calculated , with proper correction for the geometry of the trajectory and for the pitch angles of the particles .    for a gle precursor flare , which occurred on 1992 june 25 , 17:32 ut ( hard x - ray start time ) at heliographic position n10/w75",
    ", such a time - of - flight measurement is available ( fig .  4 ) , based on yohkoh / hxt and sxt observations ( aschwanden et al .  1996 ) .",
    "this flare is of the goes m1.4-class and peaked in soft x - rays at 17:54 ut .",
    "concomitant hard x - ray and radio emission is also studied in wang et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , finding a spatial separation of 35 mm between the simultaneous hard x - ray and microwave emission , which provides also an approximate scale for the horizontal and vertical extent of the flare region .",
    "this flare is a precursor to a gle event 2 hrs later at the same location , which is listed as gle event # 53 in cliver ( 2006 ) , peaking at 20:14 ut at position n10/w68 , and is classified as x3 goes - class flare .",
    "we can consider the two rapidly following events as _ homologous flares _ within the same active region that are likely to have a similar magnetic configuration .",
    "the time - of - flight distance for the precursor flare was evaluated from the time delay @xmath34 between electrons with relativistic speeds of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the hard x - ray photon energy range of @xmath37 kev , @xmath38 which after correction for electron pitch angle , helical twist of field lines , and projection effects of loop size yielded a value of @xmath33 mm , corresponding to a height of @xmath39 mm .",
    "this is a fairly typical height of the acceleration region for large flares , amounting to about the double height of the soft x - ray loops . from statistics of 42 flares ,",
    "an average height ratio of @xmath40 was obtained ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1996 ) , for flare loop radii of @xmath41 mm .",
    "thus , the height range of acceleration regions in flares amounts to @xmath42 mm , which corresponds to @xmath43 of a solar radius . in summary , since about 50% of the gle events are consistent with a particle release time during the flare hard x - ray phase , they are expected to have acceleration heights of @xmath44 solar radii .",
    "the geometry and magnetic topology of a solar flare region has been studied in most detail for the gle event of 2000 july 14 , 10:18 ut , an x5.7 goes - class flare ( e.g. , aulanier et al .",
    "2000 ; aschwanden and alexander 2001 ; aschwanden 2002 ; yan and huang 2003 ; aschwanden and aschwanden 2008 ) .",
    "the solar energy release times of the particles responsible for the gle spike during the bastille - day flare is well - synchronized with the rise phase of hard x - ray emission ( fig .  1 , table 1 ; reames 2009b ; li et al .  2007 ; wang 2009 ) .",
    "the bastille - day flare was observed near disk center , which provided an excellent view on the projected flare area , which consists of a classical double - ribbon structure as it is typical for most large flares .",
    "the double - ribbon structure straddles along a neutral line from east to west , and spreads apart as a function of time ( fig .  5 , bottom ) , as expected in the _",
    "carmichael- sturrock- hirayama- kopp- pneuman ( cshkp ) _ standard flare model .",
    "while the cshkp model essentially describes the vertical evolution in a 2-d cross - section of the flare arcade , the bastille - day flare in addition shows also the horizontal projection and the 3-d evolution in detail . from loop tracings at different times during the flare ( fig .  5 , top )",
    "it is evident that low - lying , highly - sheared loops over the neutral line brighten first , triggering a sequence of flare loops that progresses to higher - lying and less - sheared field lines above the neutral line , until we see a final double - ribbon flare arcade at orthogonal angles to the neutral line , spanning over a width of @xmath45 mm in ns direction and a length of @xmath46 mm in ew direction . from this time evolution",
    "we can reconstruct the 3-d geometry of the magnetic field lines that are involved in the flare as shown in fig .  6 .",
    "since the bright euv postflare loops outline the relaxed field line configuration after magnetic reconnection , we can directly infer the size and height of the magnetic reconnection region , which , statistically , is located about a factor of 1.5 above the soft x - ray and euv postflare loops ( aschwanden et al .  1996 ) , estimated to be in an altitude of @xmath47 mm with a length of @xmath46 mm .",
    "this height range of the magnetic reconnection region confines the overall volume of the particle acceleration region , although a highly fragmentated structure with many magnetic islands is expected , caused by the tearing - mode instability and bursty reconnection ( e.g. , sturrock 1966 ; karpen et al .  1995 , 1998 ;",
    "kliem et al .",
    "2000 ; shibata and tanuma 2001 ) .",
    "some consequences of this magnetic topology for gle events are : ( 1 ) the vertical x - type reconnection geometry allows particle acceleration in upward and downward direction in a quasi - symmetric fashion , so that particles of almost equal energies can be accelerated in both directions ; ( 2 ) the magnetic field lines above the vertical current sheet of the main reconnection regions are likely to be open , which allows escape of accelerated particles into interplanetary space and along earth - connected magnetic field lines ; ( 3 ) the relatively low height in the solar corona ( @xmath48 mm ) provides a large reservoir of thermal particles that can be accelerated in sufficient numbers that are necessary for gle detection .",
    "the escape conditions of accelerated particles into interplanetary space requires open magnetic field lines , which exist not only in coronal holes but also to a substantial fraction in active regions .",
    "schrijver and derosa ( 2003 ) found from potential - field extrapolations of the global magnetic field over the entire solar surface that the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) originates typically in a dozen disjoint regions , around the solar cycle maximum . while active regions are often ignored as a source for the interplanetary magnetic field , schrijver and derosa ( 2003 ) found that the fraction of the imf that connects directly to magnetic plages of active regions increases from @xmath49 at cycle minimum up to @xmath50 at cycle maximum , with even direct connections between sunspots and the heliosphere .",
    "evidence for open - field escape routes was demonstrated with magnetic field modeling , for instance for gle event # 70 , 2006 dec 13 , 02:27 ut ( li et al .",
    "in flaring regions that expel a cme , particles accelerated in the reconnection region behind the rising filament may be trapped inside the cme bubble and can not directly escape into interplanetary space ( reames 2002 ) , but may contribute to a seed population for secondary acceleration in cme - associated shocks ( mccracken and moraal 2008 ) .",
    "the two populations of directly - escaping and trapped - plus - accelerated particles may be distinguishable as impulsive and gradual phases of sep events .",

    "the data have been corrected for primary and secondary bremsstrahlung .",
    "a two - fold exponential decay has been fitted .",

    "the question arises whether we can exclude an interpretation in terms of a flare acceleration site for such delays .",
    "if the flare site shows , besides the impulsive hard x - ray phase , also prolonged time intervals with hard x - ray and gamma - ray emission , either an extended ( second - step ) acceleration phase or extended trapping is possible ( e.g. , vilmer et al .  1982 ) , in which case the particles responsible for gle signatures",
    "could possibly be accelerated at the coronal flare site rather than in heliospheric cme shocks . extended acceleration can be diagnosed from impulsive bursts in hard x - ray , gamma - ray , and radio emission after the impulsive phase , while indicators of extended trapping are : ( 1 ) exponential decay of x - ray and gamma - ray light curves , ( 2 ) spectral hardening in hard x - rays ( kiplinger 1995 ; grayson et al .",
    "2009 ) , or ( 3 ) type iv continuum emission in microwaves ( produced by gyrosynchrotron emission from trapped high - relativistic electrons ) .",
    "particle trapping times are limited by the collisional deflection time , which is for electrons @xmath54 and a factor of @xmath55 longer for ions .",
    "postflare loops usually expand slowly with height , so that the density drops continuously and collisional deflection times ( and thus trapping times ) become progressively longer .",
    "particle densities in the upper corona drop below @xmath56 @xmath9 , which enables trapping times over several hours .    the second diagnostic of extended acceleration , the spectral hardening after the impulsive phase , has recently been demonstrated with rhessi to be a reliable predictor of sep events ( grayson et al .",
    "2009 ) . from a dataset of 37 magnetically well - connected flares ,",
    "12 out of 18 flares with spectral soft - hard - harder ( shh ) evolution produced sep events , and none of the 19 flares without shh behavior produced seps .",
    "three of the 37 analyzed sep events are gle events and show all shh behavior .",
    "this demonstrates a statistically significant correlation between shh and sep ( and gle ) observations .",
    "since the spectral hardening happens in the hard x - rays sources at the solar flare site , as imaged by rhessi , this link between shh and sep is unexplained in the standard scenario of sep acceleration in cme - related shocks during interplanetary propagation .",
    "extended gamma - ray emission with exponential decay times has indeed been observed up to 5 - 8 hours after the impulsive phase of the gle event # 51 on 1991 jun 11 ( fig .",

    "evidence for extended particle acceleration in the lower corona was also demonstrated from microwave gyrosynchrotron emission , requiring high magnetic fields near sunspots , e.g. , for gle event # 69 , 2005 jan 20 , 06:48 ut ( grechnev et al .",

    "2005 ; miroshnichenko et al .",
    "while there is ample evidence for extended acceleration of electrons in flare sites and flare - associated radio burst sources , the situation is less clear for ions and protons ; extended acceleration of ions and protons can occur concomitantly in the same flare site , or alternatively in propagating cme shocks ( e.g. , cliver 1996 ) .",
    "let us also review the four gle events listed in table 1 that exhibit the largest delays in solar particle release times @xmath21 .",
    "the gle event # 56 on 1998 may 02 , 13:38 ut , has a delay of @xmath59 min , at a time when the impulsive flare phase is over , but the radio dynamic spectra from artemis iv show type iv continuum emission at frequencies of @xmath60 mhz during 13:42 - 13:50 ut ( see fig .  8 in pohjolainen et al .",
    "2001 ) , a clear sign of gyro - synchroton radiation from trapped high - relativistic electrons during the gle particle release time .",
    "the gle event # 58 on 1998 aug 24 , 22:05 ut , has the longest delay of @xmath61 min , but the usaf/ rstn data ( http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/meetings/lws-cdaw2009/data/white/ ) show a late increase of 15.4 ghz radio emission after 22:30 ut , which is an indicator of trapped high - relativistic electrons .",
    "the gle event # 61 on 2001 apr 18 , 02:12 ut , has a delay of @xmath62 min , but this flare is occulted by @xmath63 behind the limb , which may explain the offset timing due to the missed hard x - ray and soft x - ray peak . in an occulted flare we do not see the prompt hard x - rays from the footpoints , but only the prompt soft x - rays in coronal heights visible above the limb .",
    "the coronal high - temperature plasma above the limb cools faster ( by conductive cooling ) than the bulk of occulted soft x - ray plasma that gradually fills the postflare loops by chromospheric evporation .",
    "thus , the time profile of soft x - ray emission in occulted flares decays faster than in unocculted flares , and thus we underestimate the full duration of impulsive hard x - ray emission using the time derivative of soft x - rays .",
    "the gle event # 66 on 2003 oct 29 , 20:44 ut , has a delay of @xmath64 min , but the usaf / rstn data show very bursty radio spikes late in the flare during 20:50 - 20:56 ut at 610 mhz , a possible indication of a secondary acceleration phase producing electron beams in the lower corona . in summary , we observe in all cases with late gle solar particle release times signs of extended particle acceleration or trapping , which does not exclude that the particles responsible for the gle signatures have been accelerated and temporarily trapped ( for @xmath65 min ) at the solar flare site .",
    "we explored here the question whether the largest sep and gle events that accelerate ions with energies of @xmath0 gev could be accelerated in solar flare regions , in contrast to the generally accepted paradigm of acceleration in heliospheric cme shocks .",
    "we reviewed the _ pro and con _ aspects from the solar flare site that are relevant to answer this question , while the complementary aspects from cme - associated shocks are discussed in the companion article by gang li .",
    "the major arguments for a flare - driven acceleration of gev particles are : ( 1a ) the coincidence of the particle release time with the impulsive flare phase ( in 50% ) , ( 2a ) the similarity of the impulsive time profiles of the first gle component with the impulsive flare phase in hard x - rays , ( 3a ) observational evidence of maximum energies @xmath66 mev in electron bremsstrahlung , and ( 4a ) the relatively high magnetic field and free magnetic energy that is available in flare sites , compared to the locations of interplanetary cme shocks .",
    "in contrast , major arguments against this interpretation are : ( 1b ) significant delays of the particle release time with respect to the impulsive flare phase ( in 50% ) , and ( 2b ) the lack of direct observational evidence and diagnostics for @xmath0 gev protonts and ions in flare sites .",
    "the conclusions are based on observations of 70 gle events over the last six decades , in particular on the 13 gle events during the last solar cycle 23 ( 1998 - 2006 ) that provided excellent new imaging data in gamma rays and hard x - rays ( rhessi ) , in soft x - rays and euv ( trace , soho / eit ) , and particle data from imp , wind , and ace .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 .",
    "solar particle release times @xmath21 of gle - producing particles overlap with the impulsive phase of gamma - ray and hard x - ray emission in solar flares in 6 out of 12 ( non - occulted)cases , and thus the acceleration time of gle particles is consistent with the flare site in 50% of the cases , taking the full duration of impulsive flare hard x - ray emission ( @xmath67 min ) into account .",
    "2 .   in the remaining cases , 6 our of 12",
    "occur delayed to the flare peak by @xmath65 min , but observational signatures of extended acceleration and/or particle trapping are evident in all strongly delayed cases , and thus all gle events could potentially be accelerated in flare sites .",
    "the alternative explanation of delayed second - step acceleration in cme - associated shocks can not be ruled out , however , possibly constituting a secondary gradual gle component .",
    "3 .   the height of the acceleration region of 1 gev electrons and ions depends on the interpretation , being @xmath44 solar radii for flare site acceleration ( according to electron time - of - flight measurements ) , or @xmath68 solar radii for cme shock acceleration ( according to type ii source heights and gle solar particle release delays ) .",
    "the magnetic topology at the particle acceleration site is not well - known from magnetic modeling or tracing of coronal structures , but there is statistical evidence for open - field regions in most active regions that provide escape routes for gle particles .",
    "the recently discovered strong correlation between the spectral soft - hard - harder ( shh ) evolution of solar hard x - rays and sep events poses a new challenge .",
    "it is presently unclear how the shh evolution can be explained in the context of the standard scenario in terms of sep acceleration in cme - associated shocks .",
    "the maximum particle energies observed in solar flares reach up to several 100 mev for electrons and above 1 gev for ions .",
    "the required particle energies are @xmath69 gev for the observed bremsstrahlung continuum at photon energies of @xmath70 mev , and @xmath71 gev for pion decay radiation observed at photon energies of 10 mev @xmath723 gev , which is sufficient to explain gle detections . 7 .",
    "energies up to @xmath69 gev can be achieved for dc electric field acceleration in super - dreicer fields , for stochastic acceleration , and for shock acceleration .",
    "only dc electric field acceleration in sub - dreicer fields can be ruled out , based on the large distances of dc fields required and the inconsistency with measured electron time - of - flight delays .    what do we need to answer the question of the origin of gev particles with more certainty ?",
    "the velocity dispersion measurements with imp , wind , and ace helped enormously to narrow down the start window of solar particle release times , which could be complemented with directivity measurements of the particle detector impact on stereo .",
    "the most sensitive hard x - ray and gamma - ray detectors existed on cgro , but in near future we have only rhessi available .",
    "however , rhessi provides excellent imaging capabilities , which revealed intriguing information on displaced electron and ion acceleration sites in the solar corona ( hurford et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "in addition we expect also improved magnetic modeling of solar flare regions that can reveal open - field and closed - field geometries with more certainty , using nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) codes ( e.g. , bobra et al .  2008 ;",
    "derosa et al .",
    "2009 ) with 3-d vector magnetograph data from the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) _ , possibly in conjuction with stereoscopic 3-d reconstruction of flaring active regions using _ stereo / euvi_.    in conclusion , acceleration of gev particles in flare sites is a possibility that can not be firmly ruled out with the current localization capabilities of energetic particles .",
    "certainly we have evidence for both acceleration in coronal flare sites and in heliospheric cme shocks , often appearing concomitantly , but with different ( impulsive vs. gradual ) time scales , relative timing , and charge state characteristics .",
    "while one - sided emphasis has been given to both , either flares ( the `` big flare syndrome '' ) , or cmes ( the `` flare myth '' ; gosling 1993 ) , there is a consensus now that both flare and cme phenomena are part of a common magnetic instability , and that both are being able to accelerate particles to high energies .",
    "the remaining questions are then mostly what the relative proportions of both components are and how we can discriminate between them .",
    "a preliminary answer is that the observations are mostly consistent with a flare - associated `` prompt gle component '' and a cme - associated `` delayed gle component '' .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for pointing out a crucial timing correction , and ludwig klein for complementary comments .",

    "<S> _ ground level enhancement ( gle ) _ events represent the most energetic class of _ solar energetic particle ( sep ) _ events , requiring acceleration processes to boost @xmath0 gev ions in order to produce showers of secondary particles in the earth s atmosphere with sufficient intensity to be detected by ground - level neutron monitors , above the background of cosmics rays . </S>",
    "<S> although the association of gle events with both solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) is undisputed , the question arises about the location of the responsible acceleration site : coronal flare reconnection sites , coronal cme shocks , or interplanetary shocks ? to investigate the first possibility we explore the timing of gle events with respect to hard x - ray production in solar flares , considering the height and magnetic topology of flares , the role of extended acceleration , and particle trapping . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 50% ( 6 out of 12 ) of recent ( non - occulted ) gle events are accelerated during the impulsive flare phase , while the remaining half are accelerated significantly later . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the prompt gle component , which is observed in virtually all gle events according to a recent study by vashenyuk et al . </S>",
    "<S> , is consistent with a flare origin in the lower corona , while the delayed gradual gle component can be produced by both , either by extended acceleration and/or trapping in flare sites , or by particles accelerated in coronal and interplanetary shocks . </S>"
