    "as we anticipate the flood of new data from the second run of the cern large hadron collider , thoughts are turning to the new states that may be discovered , states that would represent a first clear sign of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "many theories of new physics that attempt to address unresolved challenges , including flavor physics and naturalness , incorporate an extended strong interaction sector .",
    "examples include models such as topcolor @xcite , the flavor - universal coloron @xcite , chiral color @xcite , chiral color with unequal gauge couplings @xcite , flavor non - universal chiral color @xcite and a flavorful top - coloron model @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the color gauge group is extended to @xmath1 at high energies ; this enlarged gauge group is spontaneously broken at low energies to the diagonal @xmath2 subgroup , which is identified with qcd . in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the broken generators become identified with a set of massive color - octet gauge bosons , generically called _",
    "colorons_.    as discussed in @xcite , one can construct a renormalizable theory by including scalars transforming appropriately under the extended color symmetry .",
    "in addition to the new massive color gauge states , new colored and uncolored scalar degrees of freedom are present in this model . moreover , cancelation of potential anomalies , which would arise if the couplings of the ordinary quarks to colorons were chiral , can require the existence of new spectator fermions .",
    "hence , if this formalism corresponds to the correct description of nature , a rich spectrum of new scalar , fermionic , and vector particles with novel properties are predicted , the discovery of which may lie within the reach of the lhc .",
    "a first complete study of hadron collider production of colorons at next - to - leading order was presented in @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector of the renormalizable coloron model has been studied in @xcite , and bounds on its properties were set by imposing limits arising from the global minimum of the potential coinciding with the scalar vevs , unitarity , electroweak precision tests , and properties of the 125  gev higgs - like scalar discovered in 2012 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a subsequent paper @xcite examined the properties of the additional ( heavier ) color - singlet cp - even scalar boson in the model , and established the expected reach of the @xmath3  tev lhc for this state in three selected scenarios with 0 , 1 , and 3 spectator fermion generations , respectively .    in this paper , recalling that gauge theories with extended scalar sectors are often subject to landau poles below the planck scale @xcite , we examine constraints that considerations of vacuum stability and triviality place on the renormalizable coloron model . after introducing the essential features of the model in section  [ prelim ] , we establish the separate cases within the model that we propose to examine in section  [ vacstab ] .",
    "specifically , we lay out four distinct scenarios with differing numbers of spectator fermion generations and different origins of the spectator fermions masses .",
    "we then compute the @xmath0-functions of all relevant couplings and determine their running behavior as a function of the renormalization scale up to a cutoff energy scale of order 100 tev .",
    "details regarding the form of the @xmath0-functions in the different scenarios are summarized in a set of three appendices .",
    "the results of the calculations and their implications for the parameter space of the model are discussed in section  [ resl ] .",
    "we show how the behavior of the @xmath0-functions translates into constraints on the model as a function of the physically relevant free parameters : masses , scalar vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and scalar mixing angle .",
    "we also provide exclusion plots showing how the constraints arising from vacuum stability and triviality compare with those obtained from other theoretical and phenomenological sources in prior work @xcite .",
    "the concluding section summarizes our findings , most notably that the scenarios in which the spectators couplings to colorons are vectorial are far less constrained by the vacuum stability and triviality bounds than those in which the couplings are chiral .",
    "the latter scenarios could be explored quite thoroughly at a 100 tev hadron collider .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the renormalizable coloron model @xcite and review the necessary notation and definitions that we will employ @xcite . in the framework of the renormalizable coloron model ,",
    "the color gauge group of the standard model ( sm ) is enlarged to @xmath1 ; this extended group is spontaneously broken to its diagonal subgroup , @xmath2 , which we identify with ordinary qcd . the spontaneous symmetry breaking also produces a set of additional massive color - octet vector bosons , generically referred to as _ colorons _ in this work .",
    "the colorons obtain their mass by `` eating '' the colored nambu - goldstone bosons of the eight broken generators of the original extended color gauge group .",
    "hence , the full theory may be characterized schematically as @xmath4 where the gauge symmetry breaking in the electroweak and the color sectors occurs at different energy scales .      the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the ( unaltered ) sm electroweak sector , @xmath5 ,",
    "is facilitated by the usual ( color - singlet ) higgs field doublet @xmath6 , at the weak scale @xmath7  gev : @xmath8 where @xmath9 corresponds to the sm higgs boson , and @xmath10 are the electroweak nambu - goldstone bosons eaten by the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 gauge fields .",
    "the extended strong sector , on the other hand , is spontaneously broken to the diagonal qcd subgroup , @xmath13 , via the vacuum expectation value of a complex multicomponent ( electroweak - singlet ) scalar @xmath14 , which assumes a bi - fundamental form @xmath15 under the two original color groups @xcite : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denotes a gauge - singlet scalar ( pseudoscalar ) degree of freedom , @xmath19 represents a set of massive color - octet scalars , and @xmath20 is the set of gell - mann matrices .",
    "the energy scale at which the spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the extended color sector is characterized by @xmath21the non - zero vev of the gauge - singlet scalar @xmath17which is presumed to be higher than the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( @xmath22  gev ) .",
    "the color - octet pseudoscalars @xmath23 in represent the colored nambu - goldstone bosons , which are eaten by the colorons to induce their mass @xcite : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the corresponding couplings of the original @xmath26 color gauge groups ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "furthermore , the usual qcd coupling @xmath28 of the massless gluons may be expressed in terms of the @xmath25 couplings , according to @xcite : @xmath29 one notes that the relations and may be inverted to express the gauge couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 in terms of the physically more relevant quantities @xmath32 , @xmath21 , and @xmath28 , resulting in : @xmath33 } \\ .\\ ] ] as an immediate consequence of , one deduces a theoretical lower bound for the coloron mass : @xmath34    the scalar sector of the model is described by the lagrangian : @xmath35 } - v(\\phi,\\phi ) \\ , \\ ] ] with the usual electroweak covariant derivative acting on @xmath6 . defining @xmath36 as the gauge fields of the two original @xmath26 color groups , and @xmath37 are orthogonally rotated ( with a mixing angle @xmath38 ) into their mass eigenstate basis ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed treatment ) .",

    "@xcite is an example of this case . ]",
    "the color covariant derivative acting on the bi - fundamental @xmath14 takes the form : @xmath43 as discussed in @xcite , the most general renormalizable form of the scalar potential contains the following terms : @xmath44 } - \\frac{v^2_s}{2 } \\right)}\\\\ & + \\frac{\\lambda_s}{6}{\\left ( { \\rm tr}{\\left [ \\phi^\\dagger \\phi \\right ] } \\right)}^2 + \\frac{\\kappa_s}{2 } { \\rm tr}{\\left [ { \\left ( \\phi^\\dagger \\phi \\right)}^{2 } \\right ] } -\\frac{\\lambda_s + \\kappa_s}{\\sqrt{6}}\\ , v_{s } r_\\delta   { \\left ( { \\rm det}\\phi + { \\rm h.c . }",

    "in addition , demanding that the global minimum of the potential coincides with the scalar vevs , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( c.f . and ) , imposes a nontrivial condition on the @xmath49 coupling @xcite : @xmath54    from the scalar potential , one deduces the following expressions for the masses of the singlet pseudoscalar and the scalar color - octet @xcite : @xmath55 which implies @xmath56    the two massive scalars in the potential that have non - zero vevs , @xmath9 and @xmath17 , are mixed with one another due to the mixing coupling @xmath46 , and may be diagonalized by performing an orthogonal rotation into their mass eigenstate basis : @xmath57 } \\ .\\ ] ] consequently , the mass eigenstates @xmath58 and @xmath59 constitute the corresponding physical scalars of the theory with the masses : @xmath60}\\sec 2\\chi   \\right\\ } } \\ .\\ ] ] the relations , , and may be used to convert the five dimensionless couplings of the potential into the physically more relevant quantities @xmath61 , @xmath21 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , according to : @xmath66 note that an attractive or repulsive interaction between the two scalar fields @xmath6 and @xmath14 in the potential , characterized by the sign of @xmath46 , is reflected in the sign of the mixing angle @xmath61 . moreover , as evident from the potential , the two scalar fields decouple in the limit @xmath67 .",

    "the lighter of the two color - neutral physical scalars in is assumed to be the @xmath58 degree of freedom , which is identified with the higgs - like state discovered at the lhc @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath71  gev .",
    "in addition , the theoretical and experimental analyses of @xcite disfavor large values of the mixing angle @xmath61 , implying that the @xmath58  scalar is more `` sm - like '' , while the heavier @xmath59  boson appears more `` singlet - like '' .",
    "the same analyses prefer a singlet vev @xmath72  tev .",
    "tevatron searches have already excluded scalar color - octet bosons in the mass range @xmath73  gev @xcite and lhc searches place the lower bound on the masses of scalar color - octet bosons at 2.70 tev @xcite ; we , therefore , assume @xmath74 throughout this work , in accordance with the assumptions made in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "finally , the experimental lower bound on the coloron mass is shown to be of order a few tev by the tevatron and lhc searches @xcite .",
    "the extended strong interaction gauge sector allows the left- and the right - handed chiral eigenstates of the quarks ( which are charged in the usual way under the electroweak interactions ) to be charged under different @xmath26 color gauge groups , giving rise to the interesting possibility of constructing a chiral theory of color @xcite .",
    "chiral charge assignments for the quarks under the extended color group will , subsequently , be reflected only in the quarks chiral couplings to the colorons ; their coupling to the gluons remains vector - like in nature , reproducing the ordinary qcd interactions regardless of the original charge assignments .",
    "such chiral color charge assignments for the quarks , however , can render the model anomalous in this sector @xcite , jeopardizing the overall consistency of the framework .",
    "the cancellation of such induced anomalies may be achieved by requiring the existence of new chiral spectator fermions @xcite whose chiral charges under the extended strong sector are the opposite of the chiral charges of the ordinary quarks .",
    "the number of spectator fermions required for anomaly cancellation depends on the details of the model under consideration .",
    "for instance , if all three generations of the ordinary quarks are chirally charged under the extended color gauge group , then three corresponding spectator fermion generations ( carrying opposite chiral charges with respect to the quarks ) are required to cancel the induced anomalies .",
    "on the other hand , if the chiral charge assignment of the third quark generation is opposite to those of the first two generations , only one additional spectator fermion generation ( one up - like and one down - like spectator ) is necessary .",
    "when all ordinary quarks are vectorially charged under the extended color interactions , no anomalies are induced and no spectator fermions are needed",
    ". for further details , see appendix  [ sec : appx - quark - charge ] .    to achieve anomaly cancellation within the extended strong sector without introducing anomalies in other sectors , the introduced spectator fermions are conjectured to interact vectorially under the electroweak gauge group .",
    "indeed , following @xcite , both the left- and the right - handed spectator generations are assumed to be doublets under the @xmath75 gauge group , while carrying a @xmath76 hypercharge @xmath77 . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectator fermions carry the same electric charges as their corresponding quark counterparts ; i.e. , @xmath78 for the up - like spectator and @xmath79 for the down - like spectator .. ] a potential mixing between the spectators and the ordinary quarks was shown to be negligible , due to the presence of strong constraints on flavor - changing coloron couplings @xcite .",
    "these anomaly - canceling spectator fermions obtain their masses via yukawa interactions @xcite with the bi - fundamental scalar @xmath14 : @xmath80 } \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath81 representing a left(right)-handed spectator doublet , and @xmath82 the generation index . taking the yukawa coupling @xmath83 as a flavor - universal parameter for convenience ,",
    "one deduces the universal mass scale of the spectator flavors in terms of the singlet vev : @xmath84 while direct collider searches exclude spectator fermions with masses below only about 700 gev , fits to precision electroweak observables raise the lower bound to a few tev @xcite .    summarizing our brief review , the renormalizable coloron model enlarges the sm color gauge group to @xmath1 ( c.f . ) , spontaneously broken to the diagonal qcd subgroup . as a consequence ,",
    "a set of massive color - octet vector bosons ( colorons ) are produced .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the strong sector is facilitated by introducing additional ( colored and color - neutral ) scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "anomalies that would arise from the ordinary quarks chiral charges under the extended color gauge group may be canceled by the addition of an appropriate number of new colored spectator fermions with opposite chiral charges . as such",
    ", the model introduces eight free parameters , which may be expressed in terms of the physically relevant quantities @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the number of spectator fermion generations .",
    "as described in section  [ prelim ] , the renormalizable coloron model , with its extended strong sector , serves as an interesting candidate description of physics beyond the sm , introducing a variety of new vector , scalar and fermionic degrees of freedom into the theoretical framework . in this section",
    ", we examine the stability of the scalar potential , as well as the triviality of its couplings , up to an energy cutoff of 100  tev . to this end",
    ", we construct the renormalization group ( rg)-improved quartic interactions , by simultaneously solving the rg equations of the four scalar quartic couplings ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath87 and @xmath48 ) , and we determine their behavior as a function of the renormalization scale @xmath88 . the stability of the scalar potential is , subsequently , guaranteed by requiring the conditions to be satisfied for the running couplings within the energy range of interest .",
    "coupling does not interfere with the running of the quartic interactions ( and , therefore , has no influence on the stability of the potential ) , since it is always accompanied by powers of the scalar vev , @xmath21 .",
    "] furthermore , we demand that the running quartic couplings remain finite within the same energy range , by imposing an upper limit of @xmath89 on their magnitudes ; i.e. , the triviality requirement should be fulfilled and no landau poles should develop .    in this study , we distinguish four separate scenarios , according to the number of spectator fermion generations and the yukawa or dirac nature of their masses .",
    "if the spectator fermions obtain their masses via yukawa interactions with the @xmath14  scalar , then either 0 , 1 , or 3 generations of the spectator fermions may be present ; we analyze each as a separate scenario .",
    "however , if the theory is vectorial in nature  and thus anomaly free by construction another possibility still exists : one can include spectator fermions whose mass arises mainly from a dirac mass term , with the yukawa interaction negligible or entirely absent .",
    "such a scenario with 1 generation of spectator fermions was introduced in @xcite , and we shall analyze the stability and triviality requirements for this scenario along with the three aforementioned cases .    in order to compute the running of the couplings as a function of the renormalization scale , it is necessary to obtain their @xmath0-functions within the context of the renormalizable coloron model . by solving the rg differential equation @xmath90 , the behavior of any of the running couplings  @xmath91 as a function of the energy may , subsequently , be determined .",
    "the analytical expressions for the one - loop @xmath0-functions of the relevant couplings of the sm , the renormalizable coloron model containing spectators with yukawa couplings , and the renormalizable coloron model containing spectators with a dirac mass term are provided , respectively , in appendices  [ smbetafun ] ,  [ recombetafun ] , and [ diracbetafun ] .    in the current treatment , we focus on capturing the essential physics of the renormalizable coloron model formalism , by considering one single relevant energy scale beyond the sm ; namely , the singlet vev , @xmath21 . taking @xmath21 as the characteristic energy scale where the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the extended color gauge group occurs , all the particle masses generated by the symmetry breaking may be approximated to reside in the vicinity of @xmath21 .",
    "this is true for the new bosonic degrees of freedom , as well as the spectator fermions with the yukawa interaction .",

    "the strong gauge sector resides in the broken phase and acts like ordinary qcd , interacting via the massless gluons with the running strong coupling @xmath28 .",
    "however , once the threshold is reached , the colorons become kinematically active and fully participate in the interactions ; the structure of the strong gauge sector is restored to the unbroken phase @xmath1 .",

    "note that the matching conditions result in different shifts for the staring points of the two @xmath25 couplings , with respect to the running value of the qcd coupling at that scale , @xmath102 .",
    "spectator fermions with yukawa interactions described by do not contribute below @xmath100 , and become kinematically accessible only above the threshold . at @xmath103 , their yukawa coupling and its @xmath0-function is activated , with the starting point given by . for spectator fermions with a dirac mass term ,",
    "the kinematic threshold above which these fermions start to participate is , instead , set by their dirac mass @xmath104 , which is independent of the symmetry breaking scale @xmath21 . in this scenario , the fermionic threshold , @xmath104 , should be treated as a free parameter separate from the bosonic threshold @xmath98 .",
    "note also that , as mentioned in section  [ ferm ] , mixing between the ordinary quarks and the spectator fermions is negligible @xcite , and their yukawa couplings remain independent of one another .",
    "the scalar sector also has distinctive behavior in different energy regimes .",
    "below @xmath100 , one may integrate out the @xmath105 @xmath14  scalar altogether from the potential by completing the square .",
    "this reproduces the sm scalar potential with the effective higgs coupling as the sole scalar interaction : @xmath106 which arises due to the mixing between the sm higgs doublet @xmath6 and the complex @xmath14  scalar .",

    ", we identify the viable region of the free parameter space , in which the stability and triviality conditions are satisfied for the four scenarios containing different configurations of spectator fermions .",

    "we have analyzed how vacuum stability and triviality requirements affect the viable parameter space of the renormalizable coloron model . to this end , we computed the @xmath0-functions of all the relevant fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom within the formalism ( presented in the appendices ) , and determined the behavior of the couplings as a function of the renormalization scale .",
    "we guaranteed the stability of the scalar potential by imposing the conditions on the running quartic couplings , while simultaneously demanding that none of the couplings encounter a landau pole , defined as a coupling value exceeding @xmath89 .",
    "we defined the viable region of the free parameter space of the theory as the region in which these vacuum stability and triviality conditions remain satisfied up to the 100  tev cutoff scale .",
    "our results are summarized in exclusion plots that include complementary prior theoretical and experimental bounds from the potential s global minimum condition , unitarity , electroweak precision tests , and the lhc measurements of the 125  gev higgs couplings .",
    "our analysis covered four separate scenarios with distinctive spectator fermion contents .",
    "the first three included 0 , 1 , or 3 generations of spectator fermions with yukawa couplings to the scalar sector of the renormalizable coloron model ; the fourth scenario includes a single spectator fermion generation with only dirac masses .",
    "our investigations revealed that the vectorial scenarios containing either no spectator fermions or 1 generation of the dirac spectator fermions leave ample viable regions of parameter space .",
    "the upper bounds our analysis places on the mass of the extra scalar state , as a function of the mixing between the two scalars in the model , arise because one or more scalar couplings encounters a landau pole .",
    "in contrast , the chiral scenarios featuring either 1 or 3 spectator generations with yukawa couplings strongly favor relatively light spectators with masses well below the symmetry breaking scale characterized by the singlet vev ( corresponding to small yukawa couplings ) .",
    "again , there are upper bounds on the mass of the extra scalar due to triviality . however , if the spectator mass is increased to lie not far below the singlet vev scale ( corresponding to moderate yukawa couplings ) then the upper bounds on the scalar mass due to triviality are accompanied by lower bounds due to vacuum stability , so that the model is viable only within a window of scalar mass vs. scalar mixing angle .",

    "if both right - handed quarks are charged under @xmath110 , the representation has precisely the same form as in the standard model with the replacement of @xmath110 for @xmath164 , and is automatically anomaly free . and mixed anomalies also cancel . ]",
    "if one or both right - handed quarks transform under @xmath163 , however , the representation is anomalous and additional ( spectator ) fermions must be added . following @xcite ,",

    "a similar arrangement is possible swapping @xmath175 , if @xmath168 is charged under @xmath163 and @xmath169 under @xmath110 instead .    finally ,",

    "none of the properties of the renormalizable coloron model discussed in this paper depend sensitively on this choice .      in a model , like the renormalizable coloron model , that includes three quark generations ( and weak - doublet spectators )",

    "first , one could choose @xcite all left- and right - handed quarks to be charged under @xmath110 .",

    "while neither case involves spectator fermions , it is the first case that we have studied in the @xmath181 scenario of sec .",

    "second , one can have two left - handed weak doublet quarks and one right - handed weak singlet up- and down - quark be charged under @xmath110 and the complement ( one left - handed weak doublet quark , and two right - handed weak - singlet up- and down - quarks ) charged under @xmath163 . in this case , one needs one  generation \" of weak - doublet spectator quarks @xmath182 to cancel anomalies  this is the case labeled @xmath183 in the body of the paper and studied in sec .",

    "in addition to specifying the gauge charges of the fermions , a complete analysis of the model requires determining the fermion mass eigenstates and examining the weak- and flavor - phenomenology that results from the extended gauge and scalar interactions . in general",
    ", phenomenological consistency will require that the additional scalar , fermion , and vector states be sufficiently heavy to be consistent with existing experimental data  and , for example , not give rise to overly large flavor - changing neutral current interactions .",
    "a thorough phenomenological analysis of all the possiblities described above is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "this paper focuses , instead , on the constraints on the renormalizable coloron model arising from high - energy vacuum stability and triviality . for the purposes of our analysis here ,",

    ". then , the top - quark mass arises from a standard - model like yukawa coupling @xcite to the weak - doublet higgs boson @xmath6  and hence the corresponding coupling constant is the same in both the low - energy ( @xmath100 ) and high - energy ( @xmath187 ) theories .",
