    "the objective of this paper is to study the formation of defects in a non equilibrium second order phase transition by means of a numerical solution of the full dynamical equations , and to compare the results with theoretical predictions to be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "topological defects are a common occurrence in symmetry broken field theories @xcite , with far reaching consequences in condensed matter physics @xcite , particle physics @xcite and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium structure of defects is deeply rooted in the topological aspects of the theory and it is well understood .",
    "the dynamical formation of defects in the process of a non equilibrium phase transition , on the other hand , only recently has been the subject of a systematic analysis .",
    "the issue at stake is how many defects are to be formed , as a function of both the dynamics of the system and the macroscopic parameters characterizing the transition , such as cooling rates .",
    "a simple , order of magnitude estimate is based on the observation that once the system is cold enough , defects will be unable to either form or disappear through thermal activation , so they will be essentially frozen into existence .",
    "this happens at the so - called ginzburg temperature , and leads to the prediction that the typical distance between defects is of the order of magnitude of the correlation length at this temperature @xcite .",
    "this picture of defect dynamics has been criticized by zurek as downplaying the non equilibrium features of the process @xcite . according to this author",
    ", the freezing of defects occurs at a much higher temperature , when the relaxation time of the system becomes large and the system effectively decouples from its environment .",
    "zurek s arguments usually lead to higher defect densities than previously though , a prediction confirmed by some experiments @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "they are supported also by numerical simulations in one and two dimensional ginzburg - landau systems with broken global symmetries @xcite .",
    "complementary to the search for a qualitative understanding of defect formation , some authors have attempted to derive the density of defects from a first principles description of the dynamics . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is a rigorous result linking the density of defects to the equal time correlation function for the order parameter , valid whenever the field probability distribution is gaussian @xcite . under the gaussian approximation , then , finding the density of defects is reduced to solving the dynamics for the correlation function @xcite .",
    "this approach , which has been recently used to show the validity of zurek s estimates in a quantum field theoretic model @xcite , is usually though to be correct early in the development of the phase transition @xcite .    in order to evaluate",
    "how reliable this kind of argument really is , therefore , we must know how far in the phase transition the gaussian approximation may be trusted .",
    "since the development of the phase transition is an essentially nonlinear process , we must expect that non gaussian correlations will be created by the dynamics itself , even if suppressed in the initial conditions .",
    "there will be a competition between the characteristic growth time due to the spinodal instability @xcite , and a variety of dynamical times describing the building of correlations through non linear interaction of fluctuations ; however , the usual gaussian models do not give us a clue about what the latter might be .",
    "the objective of this paper is to give a tentative answer to the question of the reliability of defect density estimates based on the gaussian approximation , by presenting a fully nonlinear simulation of a phase transition where we have measured the gaussianity of the order parameter , the gaussian prediction for the density of defects , and the actual density , as functions of time .",
    "of course , as long as the field is actually gaussian , the rigorous analytic prediction for the defect density is validated .",
    "the nontrivial issue is how long the field probability density remains gaussian , and whether the gaussian prediction continues to hold beyond that point .",
    "concretely , we find that even when gaussianity of the ensemble ceases to hold , the prediction remains valid , to break down about the time defects are definitely formed .",
    "our simulations follow the unfolding of an instantaneous quench to zero temperature in a two dimensional type ii superconductor , described by the time - dependent landau - ginzburg equations derived by gorkov and eliashberg @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this model is a scalar field theory interacting with a @xmath0 gauge field ( see @xcite ) but with the presence of a normal current , besides the supercurrent , and a first order ( rather than second one ) equation for the vector potential @xmath1 ( see below ) .    in order to perform the simulations ,",
    "we have discretized the model and placed it on a square lattice , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our discrete model still has gauge symmetry , which is preserved by the evolution .",
    "we have further considered a variety of lattice sizes and initial conditions , thus making sure that our results truly reflect the physics of the system .",
    "we have identified defects by measuring the winding number of the field around each lattice plaquette , thus avoiding the uncertainties related to identifying defects from zeroes in the order parameter @xcite .",
    "we find that the evolution of a typical quench goes through three well defined regimes .",
    "the early development is dominated by the exponential growth of the order parameter ; the different modes of the field evolve independently , and the field remains gaussian . in this regime , the halperin - mazenko - liu ( hml ) prediction for the defect density is very accurate .",
    "this regime ends when the order parameter reaches about a tenth of its equilibrium value .",
    "the second regime is a transitional epoch dominated by the actual formation of the defects . during this transitional epoch",
    ", the field departs from gaussianity in a significative way , but the hml prediction is still a good approximation to the actual density .",
    "finally , in the late time regime both the gaussian approximation for the order parameter and the hml prediction are unreliable .",
    "we may therefore conclude that , as argued by karra and rivers @xcite , the hml prediction holds early in the development of the phase transition , being a very accurate estimate of the actual density until the time the defects may be considered as definitely formed , which is also the time when the order parameter reaches about a half of its equilibrium value .",
    "it is therefore a suitable means to estimate the initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of the defect network , as determined by defect - defect interactions and changes in the environment , such as the expansion of the universe in cosmological applications @xcite .",
    "our results validate previous analysis of non equilibrium defect formation , such as @xcite",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first part introduces the theoretical prediction of the defect density for a gaussian quench .",
    "the second part shows the time - dependent ginzburg - landau model , and the numerical details related to its implementation .",
    "the third part describes the resulting quenches and the conclusions , and the paper ends with some final remarks .",
    "at a qualitative level , the formation of topological defects is well understood through the symmetry breaking mechanism . for a complex scalar field ,",
    "the true ground - state manifold of the field is @xmath2 and the phase of the field at different points can be different . if eventually the winding number of the field along a closed loop is not zero , then topological defects are trapped inside .",
    "because of topological considerations , isolated defects at low temperature are stable , although defects may interact with each other and annihilate , migrate to the boundaries of the system , or , in cosmology , decay through gravitational radiation .",
    "we are searching for the monopoles of one complex order parameter field @xmath3 in two dimensions .",
    "this will be identified with the zeroes of the field with non - trivial winding number .",

    "we tested grids of @xmath60 sites , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is convenient to employ larger grids , not only because of less granularity in the observed density , but also because it is possible to achieve sufficient statistics with fewer runs for ensemble .",
    "we have made about 20 runs for each ensemble , which means that the dispersions of field and defect density are in the @xmath63 level .",
    "we choose the net parameters @xmath64 , in order to resolve adequately the shape of the defects , which are expected to have a final size @xmath65 .",
    "the initial conditions were set in two different ways .",
    "we obtain a thermal distribution of modes , employing expression ( [ amplitud termica ] ) as the dispersion of a gaussian distribution of the mode amplitudes , with @xmath66 that is a temperature equal to five times @xmath28 .",
    "the cutoff was set up at the maximum radius in @xmath67-space , i.e. @xmath68 . the results are cutoff independent , in any case , due to the rapid decay of the short wavelength modes in the first steps of the quench . at the end of the quench , these modes grow again in order to define the final shape of the defects .",
    "following @xcite , we tested @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "alternatively , we started the field by choosing uniformly at random the phase of the order parameter between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and its modulus between @xmath71 and @xmath73 ( in one set of simulations ) or between @xmath71 and @xmath74 ( in another set ) .",
    "as expected , the results obtained are mostly independent of how the initial conditions are set @xcite .",
    "the presence of topological defects ( or candidate ones ) in the field @xmath75 , can be determined from the fact that for any closed curve @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 is the total topological charge of the defects inside the curve . by candidate topological defects we mean those who have a net circulation of the phase , but not the equilibrium profile",
    "that is , we have the phase defect , but the modulus is still evolving .    the presence of a vortex can be observed trough expression ( [ circulacion ] ) .",
    "numerically , we will sum the shortest difference of the phase of the order parameter field along the lines between nodes of the grid surrounding each plaquette .",
    "let us call    @xmath80    so , four neighbor sites @xmath81 ; oriented counter clockwise will yield    @xmath82    this device can only measure vorticity @xmath83 .",
    "so , we can not detect a pair vortex - antivortex laying in a single plaquette , nor vortexes with greater vorticity .",
    "but this is enough , given the mutual annihilation of very close vortexes and the almost absolute absence of higher vorticity , which can be seen in the representation of the phase of the order parameter field .",
    "by the way , periodic boundary conditions provide a test of the accuracy of the observation , because the net vorticity must vanish .",
    "higher sensitivity devices can be implemented considering higher plaquettes , which means more surrounding sites .",
    "the reciprocal representation of the field is obtained trough the usual fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite . in two dimensions",
    "this gives a discrete representation of @xmath84 at sites @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the net parameter supposed equal in both directions . with our discretization , @xmath88 , and",
    "the domain of the reciprocal representation embodies the circle @xmath89 , as well as a number of higher modes .",
    "the various mean values of the field can be obtained easily in each time step , since the space and ensemble average commute . on the other hand",
    ", the power spectrum requires saving each run for further processing .    in order to try to measure the correlation length , we consider the @xmath90 dependence of the ensemble dispersion @xmath91 of the amplitude of the @xmath92 mode .",
    "@xmath93    for a thermal distribution this is a straight line ,    @xmath94    we can estimate @xmath95 when @xmath96 , through a linear fit of the ensemble media of the spectra .",
    "this is a rough estimate , but gives a qualitative description of the behavior of the correlation length .",
    "a better determination of the correlation length can be obtained from the out of equilibrium distribution of modes @xcite ( see below ) . at long wavelengths",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath98 this factor can also be measured from a linear fit , and the system quickly reaches this regime .",
    "figure [ fig tipica ] shows a typical evolution of a quench . we have plotted the ensemble average of the absolute value of the order parameter field @xmath99 , the hml prediction @xmath100 for the defect density , the magnitude @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is the correlation length measured form a fit of the long wavelength part of the correlation function , as in eq .",
    "( [ correlacion 2 ] ) ) and the observed defect density @xmath103 , all as functions of time .",
    "this run corresponds to @xmath104 and @xmath105 we have chosen @xmath106 as the point where the second derivative of the order parameter changes sign .",
    "the figure [ fig compare ] shows @xmath107 @xmath100 and @xmath103 for all the six ensembles tested .",
    "the time scales are shifted in order to make all the inflection points of @xmath108 to coincide .",
    "we can see that the behavior of each ensemble is essentially the same .",
    "once the simulation begins , the gauge field ( initially null ) adjusts itself in order to follow the order parameter field , reacting back on it .",
    "this is what can be expected from the very different time scales involved in the equations ( [ discreta orden ] ) and ( [ discreta gauge ] ) , and it appears in the graph as the initial decay of the order parameter field .",
    "the observed discrepancy between predicted and observed defect densities is quickly smeared out by the evolution of the field .",
    "actually neither of them is reliable this early in the simulation , since the prescribed thermal distribution has too much power at short wavelengths , which can be eliminated with a cutoff .",
    "furthermore the algorithm to identify defects is blind to higher vorticity monopoles .",
    "both errors are quickly self - corrected , though , as the density of defects decays and the distribution of modes becomes a gaussian function , as in eq .",
    "( [ correlacion 2 ] ) .",
    "this gaussianity should not be confused with that of the ensemble , but just refers to the shape of @xmath109 .",
    "the first stage of the quench ( once the transient is over ) is characterized by the exponential grow of the order parameter field , which can be parametrized empirically as @xmath110 ( the dashed line in figure [ fig compare ] ) , where @xmath111 is the synchronized time .",
    "while this is to be expected from the growth of the spinodal instability , it must be observed that we are already beyond the linear regime at this stage .",
    "this is the regime where the hml prediction is essentially exact .",
    "the ensemble probability density of the field is clearly gaussian , as can be tested by the ratio @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , for a gaussian ensemble , considering only diagonal terms of the correlation we have @xmath113 . we have plotted this ratio vs time , in figure [ fig cocientes ] , together with the ratio @xmath114 and @xmath115 the plot represents the average of these quantities over all six ensembles ; the dot lines around the first two represent the dispersion between ensembles .",
    "the dashed lines around the plot of the order parameter represent the empirical fit to an exponential , and the tangent at the inflection point .",
    "when the growth of the average order parameter ceases to be exponential ( around @xmath116 , see fig .",
    "[ fig criticos ] ) , we enter a transition regime where first the gaussianity of the ensemble , and then the hml prediction cease to hold    in the final stage , from @xmath117 on , the approach to the equilibrium value is also exponential , as can be appreciated in figure [ fig criticos ] , where we have plotted the time derivative of @xmath118 , with linear - logarithmic scales . in this final stage , the exponential behavior of the field is @xmath119 , and",
    "the topological defects have attained almost their stable profiles ( see below ) .",
    "we can see that , as long as the ensemble is gaussian , the hml prediction is exact for all practical purposes .",
    "around @xmath120 , both gaussianity and the exponential growth of the order parameter break down ; however , the hml estimate is still a good approximation until later times , @xmath121 .",
    "the two main regimes in the evolution of the quench , the early one dominated by the growth of the order parameter , and the late one dominated by the evolution of the defect network , are also clearly seen in the evolution of the structure function , namely the fourier transform of the equal time order parameter correlation function ( for the structure function in systems with global symmetry , see ref .",

    "we have set @xmath140 , as predicted by theory .",
    "candidate defects exist from the very beginning of the quench , as can be detected from the phase of the order parameter field , and predicted by the hml formula .",
    "it is the development of a well defined vortex and the pattern of supercurrents around it which makes the system leave the gaussian distribution .",
    "the exponential growth slows down as soon as the modes stop behaving almost independently ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the formation of the shape of the vortex itself is also starting at this time .",

    "when the defect attains its final shape , both @xmath144 and the current die out outside the core , but there is a core contribution left , and so @xmath143 reaches a final value which is proportional to the defect density .",
    "the subsequent evolution of @xmath143 simply follows the slow decay of the defect density due to defect - defect annihilation .",
    "the figure [ fig kinefinal ] shows the ensemble average of @xmath145 ( also averaged over the six ensembles considered ) as a function of time . for comparison purposes we also show @xmath146 ( dashed line ) , where @xmath147 is the asymptotic value of @xmath145 . at time @xmath148 the final shape and current has been reached , and the tiny fluctuations are due to transients corresponding to vortex annihilation .",
    "a remarkable implication of figure [ fig kinefinal ] is that defect formation occurs at a relatively well defined epoch , from @xmath120 to @xmath149 .",
    "this paper attempts to answer the question of how reliable are estimates of the defect density based on the approximation of gaussian ensembles as applied to nonlinear phase transitions . to this effect",
    ", we have measured independently the gaussian prediction and the actual defect density as a function of time after an instantaneous quench to zero temperature in a two dimensional superconductor .",
    "the evolution of the quench goes through three stages , an initial one dominated by the unfolding of the spinodal instability , a final one dominated by defect - defect interactions , and a transitional stage when most defects are actually formed .",
    "we find that the gaussian estimate is essentially exact over the early regime , and continues to be accurate almost to the end of the epoch of defect formation .",
    "this moment in time is marked by the jump in the  kinetic  energy @xmath143 ( see eq .",
    "( [ energya ] ) ) ; it is also the time when the order parameter reaches about half of its equilibrium value .",
    "while the gaussian estimate itself is not reliable beyond this point , it is still a valid tool to fix the initial conditions of the defect network , whose subsequent evolution must be investigated by other means ( like those in this paper , or in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these results confirm theoretical expectations , but it is nevertheless satisfactory to have solid numerical proof of formerly theoretical conjectures",
    ". the very detailed view of the process of defect formation which is afforded by our simulations should also be valuable in investigating more subtle processes , such as preheating during the non equilibrium phase transition @xcite or instabilities due to strong field effects @xcite . also , by doing a more complete simulation , where we could also control the quench rate , it ought to be possible to investigate zurek s conjecture about the scaling of the defect density with the quench rate @xcite .",
    "finally , it is of interest to perform simulations in regions of parameter space approaching actual experimental contexts .",
    "we continue our research in these manyfold directions .",
