    "the discovery of large couplings between electrons and the lattice in the cuprate superconductors has led to a call for more detailed theoretical studies of electron - phonon systems in low dimensions @xcite .",
    "one of the best - known traditional approaches to the electron - phonon problem is attributed to migdal and eliashberg @xcite . in a bulk 3d system , the perturbation theory may be sharply truncated at 1st order and momentum dependence neglected if the phonon frequency is much less than the fermi energy @xcite . in physical terms , migdal s approach requires that there is a very high probability that emitted phonons are reabsorbed in a last - in - first - out order .",
    "the typical materials of interest at the time were bulk metallic superconductors where electron - phonon coupling is relatively weak , and the phonon frequency small compared to the fermi energy . for this reason",
    ", the application of migdal  eliashberg ( me ) theory has been very successful and remains highly regarded .",
    "strong electron - phonon coupling and large phonon frequencies in low dimensional systems are outside the limits of validity of the migdal ",
    "eliashberg approach .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is to evaluate and discuss the effects of both vertex corrections ( vc ) and spatial fluctuations on the theory of coupled electron - phonon systems in the superconducting state .",
    "this follows on from the work by hague treating the normal ( non - superconducting ) state of the holstein model using dca @xcite .",
    "initial attempts to include vertex corrections were carried out by engelsberg and schrieffer @xcite .",
    "other previous attempts to extend me theory include the introduction of vertex corrections into the eliashberg equations by grabowski and sham @xcite , and an expansion to higher order in the migdal parameter by kostur and mitrovi to investigate the 2d electron - phonon problem @xcite .",
    "_ generalised the eliashberg equations to include momentum dependence and vertex corrections @xcite .",
    "an anomalous hardening of the phonon mode was seen by alexandrov and schrieffer @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the applicability of these and other approximations to the vertex function can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the current paper uses dca to introduce a fully self - consistent momentum - dependent self - energy .",
    "dca extends dmft by introducing short - range fluctuations in a controlled manner @xcite .",
    "it is particularly good at describing the electron - phonon problem , due to the limited momentum dependence of the self - energy , and in this case , the self - consistent dca can be viewed as an expansion about the eliashberg equations ( in which momentum dependence is effectively coarse grained in a manner similar to dmft ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the eliashberg equations , the full form of the green s function is considered here , rather than the renormalised weak coupling green s function ( which has the form @xmath1 ) .    two approximations for the electron and phonon self energies",
    "are applied in this paper .",
    "the first neglects vertex corrections , but incorporates non - local fluctuations .",
    "the second incorporates lowest order vertex and non - local corrections .",
    "the vertex corrections allow the sequence of phonon absorption and emission to be reordered once , and therefore introduce exchange effects .",
    "the dca result is compared to the corresponding dmft result and in this way low - dimensional effects are isolated .",
    "it should be noted that in the extreme strong coupling limit , the holstein model forms a bipolaronic ground state , and perturbative methods in the electron and phonon green s functions break down @xcite . in the dilute limit",
    ", the holstein model forms a polaronic liquid .",
    "there are significant differences between the weak and strong coupling limits of the polaron problem . in the strong - coupling limit , the lang ",
    "firsov approximation may be applied , and physical properties have very different behaviour .",
    "for example the effective mass is reduced by an exponential factor of coupling .",
    "exact numerical results show that the crossover between weak and strong coupling regimes occurs rapidly at @xmath2 @xcite . for this reason",
    ", the present approximation should be considered valid for @xmath3 .",

    "dmft has been applied as an approximation to models of 3d materials @xcite . however ,",

    "migdal s approach allows vertex corrections to be neglected and becomes exact when @xmath47 , @xmath48 and is 1st order in @xmath25 . in the limit of huge phonon frequency ,",
    "the model maps onto an attractive hubbard model , so the weak coupling limit of the holstein model is only obtained by considering all second - order diagrams in @xmath25 , and me theory fails . the vertex - corrected theory described in this paper has the appropriate weak coupling behaviour for both large and small @xmath28 .    in this paper ,",

    "calculations are carried out along the matsubara axis , with sufficient matsubara points for an accurate calculation .",
    "the vertex corrected self - energies drop off more quickly with matsubara frequency , so it is possible to increase efficiency by calculating for less frequencies .",
    "typically , 256 matsubara frequencies are used for the vertex neglected diagrams , and 64 for the vertex corrected diagrams , which reach asymptotic behaviour at smaller matsubara frequencies .",
    "the scheme was iterated until the normal and anomalous self - energies had converged to an accuracy of approximately 1 part in @xmath66 .",
    "this corresponds to a very high accuracy for the green s function .",
    "obtaining superconducting solutions involves an additional step , which is not obvious at the outset . since the anomalous green s function is proportional to the anomalous self energy , initialising the problem with the non - interacting green s function leads to a non - superconducting ( normal ) state .",
    "also , the non - interacting green s function is consistent with an ungapped state and opening a gap in the electron spectrum can lead to limit cycles during self - consistency , which are damped in the normal way @xcite .    to induce superconductivity , a constant superconducting field is applied to the whole system , leading to a non - zero anomalous green s function , and automatically opening a gap in the normal - state green s function .",

    "eliashberg result .",
