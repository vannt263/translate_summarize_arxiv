    "a powerful test of the generation mechanism for cosmological perturbations in the early universe is offered by constraining non - gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "the leading theory for the origin of primordial perturbations is inflation : non - gaussianity is a sensitive probe of aspects of inflation that are difficult to probe otherwise , namely the interactions of the field(s ) driving inflation . while standard single - field models of slow - roll inflation lead to small departures from gaussianity , non - standard scenarios allow for a larger level of non - gaussianity ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , large non - gaussianity can be produced if any of the conditions below is violated : _",
    "i ) _ single field , _ ii ) _ canonical kinetic energy _",
    "iii ) _ slow roll and _ iv ) _ adiabatic ( bunch - davies ) initial vacuum state . the standard observables to constrain non - gaussianity are the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large - scale structure and in particular their bispectrum ( or three - point correlation function ) , although halo abundance and clustering can offer complementary constraints .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that violation of each of the conditions above produce its own signature in the bispectrum shape ( i.e. the dependence on the form of the triangle made by its three wave vectors ) .",
    "the type of non - gaussianity arising in standard inflation is of the type @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes bardeen s gauge - invariant potential , which , on sub - hubble scales reduces to the usual newtonian peculiar gravitational potential , up to a minus sign and @xmath2 denotes a gaussian random field .",
    "the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath3 is often considered to be constant , in which case this is called local non - gaussianity and its bispectrum is maximized for squeezed configurations ( where one wave vector is much smaller than the other two ) .",
    "non - gaussianity of the local type is generated in standard inflation ( in this case @xmath3 is expected to be of the same order of the slow - roll parameters ) and for multi - field models .",
    "note , however , that an expression like eq.([eq : fnl ] ) is not general and there are many inflationary models which predict different types of deviations from gaussianity . in general , their non - gaussianity is specified by their bispectrum .",
    "there are some cases where the trispectrum may be important ( when , for example , the bispectrum is zero ) but in general one expects the trispectrum contribution to be sub - dominant compared to the bispectrum one .",
    "while cmb and large - scale structure can measure the bispectrum shape - dependence and thus can in principle discriminate the shape of non - gaussianity ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) there are also other powerful probes .",
    "one technique is based on the abundance @xcite of rare events such as dark matter density peaks as they trace the tail of the underlying distribution .",
    "this probe is sensitive to the primordial skewness : being the skewness an integral over all bispectrum shapes , this probe can not easily discriminate among different shapes of non - gaussianity .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite(hereafter mv08 ) have shown that primordial non - gaussianity affects the clustering of dark matter halos inducing ( in the case of local non - gaussianty ) a scale - dependent bias on large scales .",
    "this effect , which goes under the name of non - gaussian halo bias , is particularly promising , yielding already stringent constraints from existing data @xcite and , with forthcoming data , offers the potential to rival the constraints achievable from an ideal cmb survey @xcite . despite being so promising ,",
    "this effect has not been extensively considered for non - gaussianity which is not of the local type .",
    "in fact , the derivation of @xcite and @xcite can only deal with local non - gaussianity .",
    "@xcite use a perturbation theory approach and obtain expressions for the local and equilateral type of non - gaussianity .    on the other hand ,",
    "the approach of mv08 is general enough to yield an expression for the large - scale non - gaussian halo bias for any type of non - gaussianity specified by its bispectrum . here",
    "we explore the effect on the clustering of halos of physically motivated primordial non - gaussianity different from the local case .",
    "we briefly review the local case , examine equilateral and enfolded types .",
    "we then concentrate on a type of non - gaussianity sourced by inflation and affecting large - scale structures , only arising when considering general - relativistic ( gr ) corrections to the standard newtonian treatment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we briefly review the @xcite description of the non - gaussian halo bias . in  3 , we consider physically motivated primordial non - gaussianity different from the local case and introduce the non - gaussianty arising from gr corrections . in  4 , we consider the constraints that planned experiments can place on these non - gaussianities and present our conclusions .",
    "halo clustering can be modeled by assuming that halos correspond to regions where the ( smoothed ) linear dark matter density field exceeds a suitable threshold . for massive halos ,",
    "the threshold is high compared to the field _ rms_. the mv08 approach to non - gaussian halo bias relies on the fact that the two - point correlation function of regions above a high threshold for a general non - gaussian field has an analytical expression @xcite which depends on all higher - order ( connected ) correlations . for most inflationary models",
    "the expression can be truncated so that it includes only terms up to the three - point correlation function . with the additional assumptions of small non - gaussianity and separations that are much larger than the lagrangian halo radius ,",
    "mv08 obtain that the halo power spectrum @xmath4 is related to the dark matter density field @xmath5 by : @xmath6\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 is the critical collapse threshold : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the linearly extrapolated over - density for spherical collapse ; it is @xmath10 in the einstein - de sitter case , while it slightly depends on redshift for more general cosmologies .",
    "@xmath11 is the linear growth factor , which depends on the background cosmology ; @xmath12 is the _ rms _ value of the underlying ( linear ) dark matter fluctuation field at @xmath13 , smoothed on a scale @xmath14 related to @xmath15 by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 denoting the present - day matter density parameter ; @xmath18 is the present - day hubble parameter , and @xmath19 is newton s constant .",
    "the effect of non - gaussianity is enclosed in the function @xmath20 which in this approach is : @xmath21 here @xmath22 denotes the expression for the primordial bispectrum of the bardeen potential @xmath1 , @xmath23 its power - spectrum . since in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnl ] ) @xmath1 is the primordial potential deep in the matter dominated era , @xmath24 accounts for the fact that the potential evolves in redshift in a non - einstein - de sitter universe ; @xmath25 is related to the poisson equation via : @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the fourier transform of the top - hat window function of radius @xmath14 .",
    "thus the correction to the standard halo bias due to the presence of primordial non - gaussianity is : @xmath28 it is clear that a scale - dependent @xmath20 could in principle give a distinctive detectable signature on the observed power spectrum .",
    "the above expressions were derived under the assumption that non - gaussianity is a  small \" correction to the dominant gaussian component of the primordial perturbations .",
    "an extensive discussion of the limits of this approximation and possible improvement is reported in @xcite ; here it will suffice to say that , looking for example at eq .",
    "[ eq : fnl ] , @xmath29 and since @xmath30 , even @xmath3 of order @xmath31 ( value which is already observationally excluded anyway ) can be considered `` small '' .",
    "in the local non - gaussian case the bispectrum of the potential is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33    looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) , it is easy to write analytically the form for @xmath20 , and to compute it for the local non - gaussian case : @xmath34 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , in the standard slow roll inflation @xmath35 is expected to be unmeasurably small .",
    "inflationary models that can produce larger non - gaussianity of the local form are those where the fluctuations of an additional light field , different from the inflaton , contribute to the curvature perturbations we observe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , for example , curvaton models ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and multi - field models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , inflationary models with higher - derivative operators of the inflaton , such as , for example , the dbi model have a different type of non - gaussianity , whose bispectrum is maximized for @xmath36 modes of similar scales ( equilateral type ; @xcite ) .",
    "the equilateral type of non - gaussianity can be well described by the following template @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38^{2/3}\\\\ \\nonumber & + & ( p_{\\phi}^{1/3}(k_1)p_{\\phi}^{2/3}(k_2)p_{\\phi}(k_3 ) + 5 cyc.)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    general deviations from the simplest slow roll inflationary models are likely to have bispectra that are not well described by the two cases above ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "predictions for the primordial bispectrum evaluated in the regular bunch - davies vacuum state , are of local or equilateral type , depending on whether higher - derivative corrections play a significant role in the inflationary evolution .",
    "non - gaussianity generated by dropping the assumption that the vacuum is bunch - davies ( modified initial state non - gaussianity ) is instead maximal for  enfolded \" ( or  squashed \" ) configurations @xcite .",
    "the associated bispectrum is a complicated function of the @xmath36 s which is not easily factorizable , but @xcite proposed a factorized enfolded template , which captures very well the fetures of the modified initial - state bispectrum .",
    "this enfolded factorizable template is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40^{2/3}\\\\ \\nonumber & - & ( p_{\\phi}^{1/3}(k_1)p_{\\phi}^{2/3}(k_2)p_{\\phi}(k_3 ) + 5 cyc.)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while so far we have concentrated on non - gaussianity generated during or right at the end of inflation , there are other non - gaussian signals generated after the end of inflation and still before matter domination .",
    "one source of non - gaussianity that has received renewed attention is the second - order evolution of perturbations from inflation to matter domination @xcite .",
    "large - scale structure probe clustering on scales that entered the horizon when radiation was important ; for large - scale modes that enter the horizon deep in matter dominated era , no perturbation growth is expected before matter domination so their entire growth history can be modeled in the standard way assuming matter domination .",
    "non - gaussianity induced by the non - linear growth of perturbations during radiation dominance , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , does not affect the non - gaussian halo - bias , as the relevant scales are different ( @xmath41 for the halo - bias ) .    on such large scales ,",
    "there is , however , an additional source of non - gaussianity , arising from gr corrections on scales comparable to the hubble radius .",
    "this effect was first pointed out by @xcite , who performed the calculation both in the comoving and poisson gauges .",
    "@xcite then extended the calculation to scales that entered the horizon during radiation dominance and recovered the @xcite expressions on large scales ( those of interest here ) .",
    "a relevant discussion on the issue can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite argue that computing the density fluctuation field in the comoving time - orthogonal gauge yields the physical expression needed to compute the large - scale halo bias .",
    "using the comoving density perturbation at second - order in the usual poisson equation , allows us to obtain the gr correction to the primordial @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , one can easily check @xcite that the resulting expression is unaffected by the presence of constant gauge modes , both at the linear and second - order levels .    with this assumption , we obtain the following expression for the large - scale structure linear - regime bispectrum including gr - corrections : @xmath42 \\nonumber   \\\\ & \\times & p(k_1)p(k_2 ) + cyc . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes terms with @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 \\label{eq : fnlinfl}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 denoting the angle between the vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "[ eq : fnlinfl ] is obtained from eq .",
    "7 of @xcite considering the terms that multiply the linear growth factor ( thus dropping the newtonian , gravitational instability terms ) , setting @xmath50 , and translating to the gravitational potential as usual .    the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "[ eq.inflbisp1 ] is the primordial contribution from standard slow - roll inflation : @xmath51 , being of the order of the slow - roll parameters @xcite .",
    "all that follows is the additional effect of interest here .",
    "let us reflect on the meaning of this contribution , which , as eq .",
    "[ eq.inflbisp1 ] shows and because it is a second - order term like the @xmath52 one , adds up to the  intrinsic \" non - gaussianity :    * the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq.inflbisp1 ] ) is non - zero even if the strictly speaking primordial contribution is zero .",
    "inflationary models different from the standard slow roll would yield a different expression for the first term in the rhs as briefly discussed above . *",
    "the shape of @xmath53 is peculiar to the inflationary initial conditions in two aspects : _",
    "i ) _ perturbations on super - hubble scales are needed in order to initially feed the gr correction terms . in this respect , the significance of this term is analogous to the well - known large - scale anti - correlation between cmb temperature and e - mode polarization : it is a consequence of the properties of the inflationary mechanism to lay down the primordial perturbations . _",
    "ii ) _ initial conditions arising from standard slow - roll single field inflation imply that the second - order comoving curvature perturbation , defined as in @xcite , @xmath54 , or equivalently @xmath55 : it is this very fact which leads to the dominance of the gr corrections .",
    "we note that in eq .",
    "( 31 ) of @xcite one can find the same quantity calculated in the poisson gauge .",
    "we have numerically verified that using the poisson - gauge expression the results for the non - gaussian halo bias are practically unchanged ( once the constant , pure gauge , modes appearing in the poisson - gauge expression are ignored ) .",
    "this is indeed encouraging , as we recover that measurable quantities are gauge - independent .    equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) enables us to compute immediately the effect of these four different types of non - gaussianity on the large - scale clustering of halos .",
    "this is the necessary step to be able to quantify their detectability for this observable .    in figure",
    "[ fig : beta ] we show the scale dependence of the halo bias ( i.e. the @xmath20 of eq .",
    "[ eq : dboverb ] ) generated by the  inflationary \" , gr - correction , large - scale structure bispectrum and we compare it with the one for the local - type primordial non - gaussianity with @xmath56 . on the scales of interest @xmath57 where the proportionality is a factor between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in other words",
    "the scale - dependent bias effect of the inflationary , gr - correction , non - gaussianity is that of a local non - gaussianity with @xmath60 .",
    "the dot - dot - dot dashed line shows the effect of equilateral type of non - gaussianity for @xmath61 , in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the effect for the @xmath62 enfolded - type ( which closely describes effects of modified initial state ) is shown by the dotted line .",
    "it is clear from fig . [",
    "fig : beta ] that while local and inflationary non - gaussianity leave a strongly scale - dependent signature on the halo clustering , equilateral and enfolded type have a much smaller effect .",
    "this is not unsurprising : local and inflationary - type primordial non - gaussianity have strong mode - correlations between small and large - scale fourier modes .",
    "for this reason , biasing , a small - scale phenomenon , can affect the power spectrum on very large scales .",
    "equilateral and enfolded - type of non - gaussianity have correlations for modes that are of comparable scales .    following the calculations presented in @xcitenormalization , while here we use the cmb normalization .",
    "see table 1 of @xcite for the cmb - normalized forecasts . ]",
    "( taking into account the calibration on n - body simulations presented in @xcite ) we can forecast what constraints could be achieved from future surveys .",
    "equilateral type of non - gaussianity can not effectively be constrained using the scale - dependent halo - bias effect : the bispectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations or of the galaxy distribution will be a much more powerful tool in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "large - scale halo - bias is extremely promising for local and gr types .",
    "forecasts for the local type were presented in @xcite , here we report that a survey of the type of euclid can constrain gr corrections - type of non - gaussianity at the @xmath63 level , while a survey like lsst could detect this signal at the @xmath64 level . for the enfolded type",
    "we obtain that a survey of the type of euclid can yield a @xmath63 error of @xmath65 while @xmath66 for lsst .",
    "these error - bars are dominated by cosmic variance and could thus , in principle , be reduced further by a factor of @xmath67few using the approach proposed by @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of detectng the signal from inflationay non - gaussianity .",
    "should a non - gaussianity of the gr - correction type ( and predicted amplitude ) be detected it would mean that _ a ) _ initial conditions are of inflationary - type and _ b ) _ strictly primordial non - gaussianity is sub - dominant to this contribution ( e.g. , @xmath68 ) .",
    "moreover , the big difference in the scale - dependent biasing factor between the classes ( equilateral , local and enfolded ) of non - gaussian models implies that the large - scale halo bias is a very sensitive tool to probe the shape of non - gaussianity , highly complementary to other approaches .",
    "+ in table [ tab:1 ] we show a comparison of the forecasted constraints on different type of non - gaussianity for a selection of planned experiments for cmb bispectrum and large - scale halo bias .",
    "l c c c c c local & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & & @xmath71 & @xmath72 + equilateral & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & & @xmath75 & @xmath75 + enfolded & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + gr & n / a & n / a & & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + secondaries & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & & n / a & n / a +    this table highlights the complementarity of the two approaches . while forecasted constraints for enfolded non - gaussianity from cmb data are not available , we can estimate that the errors would be in - between the equilateral and the local case . one could thus envision different scenarios .",
    "if non - gaussianity is local with negative @xmath3 and cmb obtains a detection , then the halo bias approach should also give a high - significance detection ( gr correction and primordial contributions add up ) , while if it is local but with positive @xmath3 , the halo - bias approach could give a lower statistical significance for small @xmath3 as the gr correction contribution has the opposite sign .",
    "if cmb detects @xmath3 at the level of @xmath84 and of a form that is close to local , but halo bias does not detect it , then the cmb bispectrum is given by secondary effects .",
    "if cmb detects non - gaussianity but is not of the local type , then halo bias can help discriminate between equilateral and enfolded shapes : if halo bias sees a signal , it indicates the enfolded type , and if halo bias does not see a signal , it indicates the equilateral type .",
    "thus even a non - detection of the halo - bias effect , in combination with cmb constraints , can have an important discriminative power .    in any case",
    ", if the simplest inflationary scenario holds , for surveys like euclid and lsst , the halo - bias approach is expected to detect a non - gaussian signal very similar to the local type signal with an amplitude of @xmath85 which is due to large - scales gr corrections to the poisson equation .",
    "this effect should leave no imprint in the cmb : once again the combination of the two observable can help enormously to discriminate among models for the origin of cosmological structures .",
