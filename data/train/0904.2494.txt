    "this paper is devoted to the analysis of the nonlinear delay differential equation @xmath4 this equation arises from a model of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells dynamics , that is stem cells at the root of the blood production process @xcite .",
    "it describes the fact that the cell density evolves according to mortality and cell division .",
    "one may stress that the cell density considered in equation ( [ equationx ] ) is in fact the density of resting cells , in opposition to the density of proliferating cells .",
    "the distinction between these two stages of the cell cycle is now widely accepted .",
    "we can cite , for example , the works of burns and tannock @xcite on the existence of a resting phase  also called @xmath5-phase  in the cell cycle .",
    "this phase is a quiescent stage in the cell development , contrary to the proliferating phase which represents the active part of the cell cycle : it is composed of the main stages of the cell development ( e.g. dna synthesis ) and ends at mitosis with the cell division .",
    "thus , proliferating pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells are committed to divide and give birth to two daughter cells which immediately enter the resting phase and complete the cycle .",
    "mathematical models describing the dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells population have been studied since the end of the seventies and the works of mackey @xcite . for the reader interested in this topic",
    ", we mention the review articles by haurie _",
    "_ @xcite and mackey _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and the references therein .",
    "recently , pujo - menjouet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved the existence of a hopf bifurcation for the hematopoiesis model proposed in @xcite , described by a nonlinear differential equation with discrete delay .",
    "however , their results can not be directly applied to ( [ equationx ] ) because of the nature of the delay .",
    "delay differential equations with distributed delay have been studied by many authors .",
    "we can cite , for example , the works in @xcite . however , these studies mainly focused on stability conditions . in 2003 , liao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed the existence of a hopf bifurcation for a van der pol equation with distributed delay and studied the stability of limit cycles , applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem .",
    "the characteristic equation in @xcite is an exponential polynomial , similar to the one obtained in @xcite except that the degree is higher , which makes the study easier than with equation ( [ equationx ] ) . in @xcite , adimy _ et al . _",
    "obtained the existence of a hopf bifurcation for a nonlinear differential equation with a delay distributed according to a density , generalizing equation ( [ equationx ] ) .",
    "however , these authors did not study the limit cycles of their model .",
    "we consider a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells population density @xmath6 , satisfying the nonlinear delay differential equation ( [ equationx ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath7 accounts for natural mortality and cellular differentiation .",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath8 represents a rate of introduction in the proliferating phase .",
    "the last term appears to describe the amount of cells due to cell division : cells are assumed to divide uniformly on an interval @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and dividing cells are in fact cells introduced in the proliferating phase one generation earlier .",
    "the assumption on the cell division comes from the fact that , even though only a little is known about phenomena involved in hematopoiesis , there are strong evidences ( see bradford _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) indicating that cells do not divide at the same age .",
    "the factor @xmath11 describes the division of each mother cell in two daughter cells .",
    "the rate of reintroduction in the proliferating compartment @xmath12 is taken to be a monotone and decreasing hill function , given by @xmath13 the coefficient @xmath14 is the maximum rate of reintroduction , @xmath15 is the resting phase population density for which the rate of re - entry @xmath12 attains its maximum rate of change with respect to the resting phase population , and @xmath16 describes the sensitivity of @xmath12 with changes in the population .",
    "this function was firstly used in hematopoiesis models by mackey @xcite in 1978 .    in @xcite mackey gave values of the above parameters for a normal human body production .",
    "these values are @xmath17 usually , @xmath18 is close to @xmath19 , but mackey @xcite reports values of @xmath18 around @xmath20 in abnormal situations .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is usually @xmath22 however , since we shall study the qualitative behavior of the pluripotent stem cells population , the value of @xmath21 is not really important and setting the scale change @xmath23 in ( [ equationx ] ) , with the function @xmath12 given by ( [ beta ] ) , we obtain @xmath24 with @xmath25 however , we mention that this special form of @xmath26 will not be used in the following , except in computations in section [ snumerical ] .",
