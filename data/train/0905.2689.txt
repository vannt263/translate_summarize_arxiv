    "however , when considered in more detail the growth of amorphous materials may present its own complications . for example , studies of rubrene thin films on silicon uncovered a surprising growth behavior : using x - ray reflectivity rubrene thin films are found to be relatively smooth and amorphous over a large thickness range @xcite .",
    "yet , an anomalous roughness evolution of the films is observed , i.e.  a decrease of the film roughness at the beginning ( below @xmath420 nm ) and a subsequent increase of the roughness at a later stage .",
    "recent near edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) results indicate the existence of different rubrene isomers on sio@xmath5 and au(111 ) @xcite . at the early stage of growth",
    "both species were identified , i.e.  the rubrene with the twisted and planar tetracene backbone , followed by the planar isomer only .    in the present study we focus on the optical properties of rubrene molecules in solution and amorphous thin films . in particular",

    "we calculate the optical response of the different isomers of rubrene with time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) .",
    "the deformation in the relaxed excited geometry of each isomer found with td - dft is projected onto its internal vibrations .",
    "this allows an assignment of the observed sub - bands in the absorption spectra to an effective vibrational mode which is an average over the various internal vibrations elongated in the relaxed excited geometry .",
    "furthermore , we use the calculations to assess the contribution of the different rubrene isomers to the observed spectra .",

    "the experimental data were analyzed with the commercial wvase software package @xcite .",
    "since rubrene grows in amorphous films , we used an isotropic model consisting of three layers , i.e.  rubrene  silicon dioxide  silicon , with the optical constants of silicon and silicon dioxide taken from ref .",
    "first , we determined the thickness of the rubrene film by employing a cauchy model in the spectral range below 2ev , where the absorption of the organic material is negligible .",
    "then , we performed a point - by - point fit which yields the complex dielectric constant @xmath15 for each energy , see fig .",

    "we have chosen the b3lyp hybrid functional since it gives excellent molecular geometries of organic molecules together with rather precise transition energies resulting from a compensation between the systematic deviations arising from the underlying gradient - corrected density functional and the hartree - fock contribution @xcite .",
    "for the electronic orbitals , we use a triple-@xmath35 valence polarized ( tzvp ) basis @xcite throughout this article .    in order to cover the twisted and the planar isomers of rubrene",

    "the charge distribution of the solute molecule polarizes the medium surrounding it , resulting in a further stabilization energy .",
    "this phenomenon can be handled with the conductor - like screening model ( cosmo ) , where the solute is treated as lying inside a cavity surrounded by the polarizable medium @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the response of the dielectric medium is replaced by an ideal conductor , generating screening charges on the surface of the cavity . in a second step",
    "these screening charges are scaled by a factor @xmath39 depending on the dielectric constant @xmath40 of the solvent , @xmath41 .",
    "we have applied the respective routine as implemented in the turbomole 5.7 program package to a geometry optimization of each isomer in a medium with a dielectric constant of epsilon=20.7 corresponding to acetone . at the b3lyp / tzvp level we found stabilization energies of @xmath42  ev for the planar isomer , and @xmath43  ev for the twisted isomer .",
    "this is reducing the energetic difference between the two isomers by a small amount , but the twisted isomer still remains more stable by @xmath44  ev .    even though the twisted isomer is more stable both as a free molecule and in solution , in the crystalline phase the planar isomer can be stabilized by a beneficial geometric arrangement between neighboring molecules , resulting in a large cohesive energy so that the energetic cost of the planarization is overcompensated by attractive inter - molecular interactions . in the amorphous phase of solid rubrene it is expected that the twisted geometry is conserved because the random positions and orientations of the neighboring molecules can not stabilize an unfavorable isomer .",
    "the different energies of both isomers raise the question if the planar isomer is stable , or if it can spontaneously transform into the more favorable twisted geometry . using b3lyp and basis sets in the size range between 6 - 31g(d ) and tzvp",
    "we found that the lowest symmetry - breaking @xmath45 mode in the @xmath37 point group received a small imaginary frequency .",
    "for the larger tzvp basis this apparent instability was found to depend on the integration grid : a calculation using the standard @xmath46 grid resulted in an imaginary frequency of @xmath47  @xmath48 , but based on a denser @xmath49 grid , this value decreased towards @xmath50  @xmath48 . using a tighter convergence of @xmath51  hartree , the energetic minimum along this imaginary mode occurs at 12  @xmath52  mev below the @xmath36-symmetric isomer .",
    "however , independently of basis size and integration grid , for larger deformations along this vibrational eigenvector , the shape of the potential returns to an essentially parabolic minimum , with a tiny distortion for small deformations .",
    "hence , this ultra - soft or even imaginary mode does not constitute a viable barrierless pathway from the planar isomer to the twisted configuration .",
    "for the twisted isomer we found positive frequencies for all vibrational modes , the lowest being a breathing mode at 26  @xmath48 .    in the twisted isomer",
    "the repulsion between the phenyl side groups achieves a rather larger distance between them as opposed to the planar isomer , where a relatively small distance between the phenyl groups is enforced by the rigidity of the bond connecting each side group to the tetracene core and by the more restrictive point group @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the twisted isomer gains a substantial amount of energy through a reduction of these repulsive interactions , allowing eventually to invest a part of this energy into the unfavorable twist of the tetracene backbone .",
    "the resulting angle between the two central rings of the tetracene core is @xmath53 in the electronic ground state , and the angle between the two final rings @xmath54 , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : isomers]b . in",
    "the relaxed excited state these angles increase to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .    for both isomers",
    "the relaxed excited geometries are computed with time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) at the b3lyp / tzvp level , conserving in each case the point group of the electronic ground state .",
    "the resulting deformation pattern is projected onto the symmetry - conserving breathing modes of the respective isomer in its ground state , defining in turn a huang - rhys @xmath57 factor for each vibration @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the lowest symmetry - breaking vibration of the planar isomer the frequencies of the symmetry - conserving modes depend only weakly on variational basis set and integration grid , with the largest influence for the lowest breathing mode found at 19  @xmath48 ( b3lyp / tzvp , @xmath46 ) or 22  @xmath48 ( b3lyp / tzvp , @xmath49 ) . correspondingly , we have determined similar values for the huang - rhys factors obtained at these levels . applying the projection scheme to the deformation pattern of a cationic molecule",
    ", we have reproduced the key features of previous calculations addressing the huang - rhys factors in the planar isomer @xcite . of course , when compared to the cationic geometry , a neutral excitation of a planar rubrene molecule produces a somewhat different set of huang - rhys factors .    by averaging over vibrations in the range between 900 and 1800@xmath48",
    "we define an _ effective mode _ with a huang - rhys factor @xmath59 , a reorganization energy @xmath60 , and a mode energy of @xmath61 .",
    "the harmonic approximation to the potential energy surface results in slightly too large vibrational frequencies . in order to compensate for this deviation",
    "we apply a scaling factor of 0.973 adequate for the b3lyp functional to the vibrational frequencies @xcite , conserving however the reorganization energies @xmath62 assigned to each mode , so that the huang - rhys factors are increased by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "the results of this computational procedure are reported in tab .",

    "we expect that this procedure minimizes artifacts arising from finite angle effects related to the relatively large changes of these angles in the relaxed excited geometry @xcite .",

    "this illustrates that the transition energy @xmath73  ev measured for rubrene in thin films shows a significant redshift which is caused by the environment .",
    "since the huang - rhys factors for rubrene monomers dissolved in acetone and amorphous thin films show only minor differences , i.e.@xmath74 and @xmath75 , we conclude that the exciton - phonon coupling is not markedly influenced by aggregation of the molecules  most likely because the investigated thin films are amorphous and the phenyl side groups keep those neighboring tetracene backbones apart that are mainly involved in the @xmath76 transition .",

    "for the solution spectrum we find a simple monotonic dependency , whereas the thin film spectrum shows a different behavior with the width of the first peak being larger than the second one .",
    "one could speculate that this observation is related to the reported existence of a conformational rubrene isomer with a slightly different electronic transition energy @xcite . in order to verify whether two different isomers contribute to the optical spectra",

    "[ fig : simulation_mixing]a ) .",
    "overall the simulations indicate that a contribution of the second rubrene isomer is relative small , i.e.  below 10% . because the twisted isomer is energetically favorable",
    "we conclude that the thin film spectrum is dominated by the twisted molecule and a fraction of no more than 10% of planar molecules may contribute to the spectrum .",
    "the differences between the solution and the thin film spectrum in the high - energy range , however , can not be explained by contributions of a small fraction of planar molecules alone .",
    "additional coupling in the thin film , like exciton transfer , might be the origin of this deviation .",
    "the optical spectra of rubrene thin films and monomers in solution have been investigated experimentally by spectroscopic ellipsometry and uv - vis spectroscopy .",

    "since the two rubrene isomers show different transition energies , the optical spectra may reveal their existence .",
