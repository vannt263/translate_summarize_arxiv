    "decisive evidence is mounting in support of a galactic halo predominately formed through mergers and accretion .",
    "high - redshift observations , and modern simulations of structure evolution within the framework of cold dark matter @xcite , suggest that large galaxies formed hierarchically through the progressive merger of smaller pre - galactic structures .",
    "observational evidence of this process can be identified in fossil remains of past accretions or mergers in the milky way .",
    "the remains of an accreted galaxy can be identified in the galactic halo as coherent substructure in space @xcite , velocity , or both @xcite .",
    "there are several examples of such coherent groups @xcite .",
    "one of the most dramatic is the sgr dwarf @xcite and its extension to at least 17 kpc to the se @xcite , which demonstrates that galaxy accretion is a process that continues even today .",
    "more recently @xcite and @xcite found an over - density of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars and rr lyrae type stars , respectively , in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) commissioning data .",
    "the over - density covers @xmath4 on the sky and is located near @xmath5 h , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , 50 kpc from the sun , and is @xmath3 from the center of the sgr dwarf .",
    "this structure has also been detected with carbon stars @xcite , and cmd analysis @xcite .",
    "very recently , this feature was also found by @xcite as part of the quest rr lyae type variable star survey .",
    "they also found an over - density of rr lyrae stars at closer distances , partially associated with the globular cluster pal 5 , and partially without identification .",
    "comparison to models of the disruption of the sagittarius galaxy @xcite strongly suggests that this structure is tidally stripped material from the sgr dwarf @xcite .",
    "however , none of the techniques to date have been able to confirm this with both distance and velocity data . as part of the spaghetti project survey ( sps ) @xcite",
    ", we have serendipitously identified giants associated with the sdss over - density , and measured their radial velocities and distances .",
    "the excellent agreement with model predictions leads us to conclude that this structure is , indeed , tidal debris from the sgr dwarf .",
    "furthermore , we have identified additional structures at different distances which may be multiple wraps of the sgr dwarf tidal stream .",
    "the sps is a photometric and spectroscopic survey designed to identify structure in the galactic halo @xcite . for this study",
    "we use the modified washington photometric system @xcite to identify candidate red giants .",
    "the @xmath9 color index is sensitive to surface gravity , while @xmath10 gives a photometric abundance .",
    "candidate halo stars must be observed spectroscopically to confirm the photometric classification and metallicity , and to obtain a radial velocity .    by chance ,",
    "a number of survey fields with existing photometry and spectroscopy lie near the direction of the sdss over - density .",
    "we will focus on 16 of these fields which lie in the region defined by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , and were imaged in april 1999 @xcite . a complete list of these fields , and the stellar photometry , is available through the nasa adc database ( http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) .",
    "we applied our giant selection criteria @xcite to the photometry from this subset of fields . in order to include some fainter , potentially more distant giants in our first spectroscopic observations with magellan",
    ", we relaxed the @xmath9 error selection limit , which is the most crucial @xcite , from 0.02 to 0.032 magnitudes , matching the largest error among all previously confirmed giants in these fields .",
    "there are 32 giant candidates , of which 21 have been confirmed spectroscopically using the criteria of @xcite .",
    "these are listed in table [ tabgiants ] .",
    "the photometric metallicity @xcite , coupled with globular cluster giant branches @xcite , transformed to @xmath14 @xcite , allows us to determine the absolute magnitude of each star .",
    "the metallicity determined in this way is subject to errors of order 0.3 dex , which leads to distance errors of about 25% .",
    "the spectra for the six most distant giants are shown in fig .",
    "[ figspectra ] , along with two standards for comparison .",
    "star l355.89b+51.10 was observed on 20 - 22 february 2001 with the newly commissioned 6.5 m magellan i telescope at las campanas , with the lco b&c spectrograph .",
    "details of the spectral reduction process can be found in @xcite . both velocities @xcite and preliminary metallicities @xcite were determined from the spectra .",
    "velocities are accurate to 20 km / s . in most cases",
    "the agreement between the spectroscopic and the photometric metallicities is better than 0.2 dex .",
    "the photometric value is listed in table [ tabgiants ] , with the exception of l356.15b+50.95 , whose preliminary spectroscopic metallicity differed significantly from the photometric value .",
    "fig .  [ figlum ] is a histogram of the heliocentric distance for all giant candidates .",
    "the filled histogram is the subset of candidates that have been confirmed to be giants spectroscopically .",
    "the curve is the predicted number of giants based on a model from @xcite for a smooth @xmath15 halo .",
    "the model is normalized using the local halo giant density @xcite , and has an axial ratio variation prescribed by @xcite .",
    "a model was made for each of the 16 selected fields , including a bright cutoff limit which varied from field to field , and a constant faint cutoff at @xmath16 .",
    "there is a concentration of candidates between 40 and 60 kpc , matching the distance of the sdss over - density . of these ,",
    "four stars have radial velocities . based on our success rate for stars at this magnitude",
    ", we expect approximately half the remaining candidates at this distance will be confirmed to be giants , and the other half will be revealed to be subdwarfs @xcite . taking this into account",
    ", there remain 3 - 4 stars in each of the three bins near 50 kpc , where we only expect 1 - 2 stars .",
    "even more striking is the correlation of radial velocities for stars in this structure .",
    "the velocities of the four stars with spectra are remarkably similar ( @xmath17 km / s ) compared to the velocity dispersion of all confirmed giants ( @xmath18 km / s ) .",
    "this association is certainly indicative of a coherent structure .",
    "the models developed by @xcite predict that the sgr dwarf corresponds to only the central region of a much larger , at least a few times @xmath19 m@xmath20 , progenitor .",
    "these models predict that a large amount of mass would be expected in streams , which can either be stellar or dark - matter dominated . in fig .",
    "[ figmodel ] we plot the heliocentric distance and radial velocity for the particles in their stellar model which fall within our selected region of the sky .",
    "we have also plotted the locations of all candidate giants with measured radial velocities .",
    "the four stars near 50 kpc are shown with filled circles , and match very well both the distance and radial velocity found in the models .",
    "in addition to the concentration of giant candidates near 50 kpc , there is one near 20 kpc and one near 80 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ figlum ] ) .",
    "the radial velocities of most of the stars near 20 kpc ( fig.[figmodel ] ) match the predictions for the sgr dwarf streams , however , the range of predicted velocities at this distance is so large that this can not be considered strong support for these being associated with the sgr dwarf tidal debris .",
    "it is interesting to note that if most of these 20 kpc stars are indeed sgr debris , then the smooth halo density at this distance must be much lower than simple models predict .",
    "this would suggest a large fraction of the halo may be composed of stream - like structures , even as close as @xmath21 kpc .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath22 kpc concentration , the two stars at 80 kpc show a spatial density and a velocity correlation above that expected from a smooth halo . their position and velocity match model predictions for an earlier `` wrap '' of the sgr dwarf tidal stream .",
    "we compared the distance and velocity distribution of the 21 candidates with that of a smooth halo model .",
    "the smooth halo has an @xmath15 density profile , and a radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid with @xmath23 km / s .",
    "we performed 10,000 monte carlo simulations of 21 stars drawn from the smooth halo , including observational errors .",
    "the fraction of simulations which gave the observed distribution of 4 stars near 50 kpc with velocity dispersion of 32 km / s , _ and _ 2 stars near 80 kpc with velocity dispersion 21 km / s , was 11 in 10,000 .",
    "we also performed this same exercise by drawing the samples from the model of the sgr dwarf ( helmi & white 2001 ) .",
    "nearly 70% of these 10,000 samples result in the observed distribution .",
    "thus , the likelihood that these stars belong to a smooth halo is negligible .    the present data can not be used to make a full comparison to the spatial density of the model stream . in particular ,",
    "the spatial sampling of our fields , at this point , is too sparse to determine the width or direction of the stream , and numerous selection effects must be addressed .",
    "we can only note that the confirmed members at 50 kpc are spread over @xmath24 in longitude .",
    "if the two stars at 80 kpc are included the spread is over @xmath25 in longitude .",
    "furthermore , a detailed density comparison , for example , to determine if the 20 kpc stars are part of a stream or part of a smooth halo , must await a larger area to be studied , preferentially located far away from the expected sky position of the sgr streams @xcite .    finally , we note that the mean metallicity of the six stars we claim to be part of the sgr stream ( [ fe / h ] @xmath26 ) is about 0.5 dex lower than the mean for field stars in the main body of the sgr galaxy @xcite .",
    "many dsph galaxies show radial gradients in their horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies , such that the outer hb stars are bluer @xcite .",
    "since the outermost stars are preferentially stripped during tidal disruption @xcite , the streams could exhibit a different hb population than the more tightly - bound core .",
    "this could explain why the sdss over - density consists of large numbers of blue hb stars , while such stars are mostly absent in the core of sgr .",
    "this is also consistent with the lower metallicity of the stream stars if the hb morphology gradient reflects an underlying metallicity variation in sgr .",
    "the destruction of dwarf galaxies is probably a crucial element in building up the stellar halo of our galaxy . with further observations ,",
    "the age information that we can recover from the different wrappings , combined with the metal abundances of the stream stars , will give a detailed observational picture of the progressive destruction of this galaxy .",
    "deriving the chemical enrichment and star formation as a function of time and position in the galaxy will , for example , help us understand the effect of tides on the internal evolution of such apparently fragile systems .",
    "mapping the streams of sgr will also provide some strong constraints on the large scale evolution of the shape and structure of the galactic potential on gyr time - scales , and on the amount of dark matter substructure .",
