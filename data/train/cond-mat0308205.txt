    "the progress in miniaturization of electromechanical devices towards the nanometer scale ( nems ) is beginning to reach the limit , where quantum effects play an important role  @xcite .",
    "for example , in nanoscale beams phonons may propagate ballistically , leading to a quantized thermal conductance  @xcite .",
    "moreover a sizeable contribution to the forces between plates and beams which are separated by less than one micron is the casimir force between neutral objects due to the modification of the electromagnetic vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the combination of electrical and mechanical properties may be studied via quantized transverse deflection due to charge quantization of charged , suspended beams in an electric field  @xcite .",
    "similarly the standard coulomb - blockade in small metallic islands or in semiconducting quantum dots may be used to mechanically transfer single electrons with a nanomechanical oscillator  @xcite . regarding possible applications of nanomechanical sensors , si - based resonators in the radio - frequency regime",
    "were recently fabricated and manipulated  @xcite . in the present work we focus on quantum effects in mechanical resonators on the nanometer scale , in particular in single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) . due to their small masses and remarkable elastic properties down to nanometer scale ,",
    "carbon nanotubes are ideally suited to study effects like phonon quantization  @xcite , the generation of non - classical states of mechanical motion  @xcite or macroscopic quantum tunnelling out of a metastable configuration  @xcite . on the classical level , both the thermal brownian motion of single nanotubes",
    "clamped on one side  @xcite and the discrete eigenmodes of charged multiwall nanotubes excited by an ac - voltage  @xcite have been detected experimentally .",
    "more recently , the thermal vibrations of doubly clamped swnt s down to lengths of around @xmath0 have been observed with a scanning electron microscope  @xcite . in all of these cases",
    "it turns out that the measured transverse vibrations of nanotubes agree reasonably well with the predictions of an elastic continuum model .",
    "its applicability even on the nm scale is also supported by molecular dynamics simulations which show that swnt s down to lengths of around @xmath1 are well described by an effective elastic continuum , responding in a reversible manner up to large deformations  @xcite . in the following , we will therefore use the standard theory of an elastic continuum  @xcite for carbon nanotubes which are clamped between two fixed end points .",
    "we calculate both thermal and quantum fluctuations of the nanotube under longitudinal compression , including properly the nonlinearity in the bending energy .",
    "it is shown that in swnt s with a length below @xmath2 the crossover from thermal to quantum zero point fluctuations is reached at accessible temperatures of around @xmath3 .",
    "we also discuss the possibility to realize coherent superpositions of macroscopically distinct states by observing the avoided level crossing near the degenerate situation above the critical force of the well known euler - buckling instability .",
    "our model system is a freely suspended swnt of length @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 which is fixed at both ends , allowing only transverse vibrations . in addition",
    "we consider a mechanical force @xmath6 which acts on the beam in longitudinal direction ( @xmath7 for compression ) . in a classical description",
    "the beam is then completely described by the transverse deflection @xmath8 parametrized by the arclength @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "we assume the beam to be incompressible in longitudinal direction and only keep a single transverse degree of freedom for simplicity ( see below )",
    ". for arbitrary strong deflections @xmath8 the nonlinear lagrangian of the system is then  @xcite @xmath10.\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the mass density , while the bending rigidity @xmath12 is the product of the elasticity modulus @xmath13 and the moment of inertia @xmath14 , with @xmath15 an effective wall thickness . for small deformations @xmath16",
    "the lagrangian is quadratic , leading to the standard linear equation of motion @xmath17 for the transverse vibrations of an elastic beam under compression .",
    "the corresponding eigenmodes @xmath18 and eigenfrequencies @xmath19 depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that the experimental realization  @xcite is well described by clamped ends at both sides , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the exact @xmath18 s are then given by a superposition of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions , and the @xmath19 s by solving a transcendental equation  @xcite . in the following , for some of the analytic expressions",
    ", we will use boundary conditions without bending moments at the ends of the beam , @xmath22 .",
    "this leaves the essential physics unchanged and permits one to write down simple expressions for the eigenfunctions in the normal mode expansion @xmath23 and its eigenfrequencies @xmath24 clearly the modes soften with increasing compression @xmath6 , up to a critical force @xmath25 where the fundamental frequency @xmath26 vanishes .",
    "then the system reaches a bifurcation point , the well known euler instability , beyond which @xmath27 becomes the new stable solution of the static problem . for clamped boundary conditions with finite bending moments at @xmath28 the critical force",
    "is four times larger , and the shape of the stable solution in the static problem for @xmath29 has the form @xmath30 . near criticality ,",
    "the frequencies of higher modes @xmath31 remain finite .",
    "the dynamics at low frequencies is thus determined by the fundamental mode alone .",
    "the nonlinear field theory eq .",
    "(  [ eq : lagrangian ] ) may be quantized in the standard manner by requiring canonical commutation relations @xmath32=i\\hbar\\delta(s - s')$ ] between the field @xmath33 and its canonically conjugate momentum @xmath34 at equal times . in the linear regime ,",
    "the problem is reduced to an infinite number of harmonic oscillators . introducing oscillator lengths",
    "@xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the amplitudes @xmath38 are expressed by the standard creation and annihilation operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the effective masses @xmath41 arising in @xmath42 turn out to be @xmath43 of the beam mass for the fundamental mode but are generally mode dependent for clamped boundary conditions .",
    "in the linearized theory , the mean square displacement of the beam is trivially calculated from the normal mode expansion eq .",
    "(  [ eq : eigenm ] ) . assuming a thermal occupation of the discrete phonon modes one obtains a maximum value at the center of the beam , which for unclamped boundary conditions reads @xmath44 here the scale is set by the oscillator length @xmath45 and the temperature @xmath46",
    "is associated with the frequency scale of the fundamental mode @xmath47 .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 determines the dimensionless distance from the critical compression force .    at temperatures larger than @xmath49 one obtains the usual equipartition theorem result , where @xmath50 increases linearly with @xmath51 as observed on sufficiently long nanotubes  @xcite . for low temperatures",
    "the mean square displacement remains finite due to zero point fluctuations .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phisq ] the crossover to this regime occurs at @xmath52 in the absence of an external force @xmath53 , giving accessible temperatures of around @xmath54 for typical swnt s ( see table  [ tab : values ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the associated transverse deflection amplitude @xmath55 is only of order @xmath56 and thus beyond accessibility of standard displacement detection techniques .",
    "there are a number of ways , however , to measure such tiny amplitudes , for instance by capacitively coupling the beam to the gate of a single electron transistor @xcite or using its electrostatic interaction with a free - standing quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "of course the fluctuations are strongly enhanced near the critical force @xmath57 , where only the fundamental mode @xmath58 contributes and thus @xmath59 increases like @xmath60 . in this case , the problem of measuring the thermal to quantum crossover is somehow inverted , since now the decreasing crossover temperature @xmath61 poses a limiting factor for an observation .",
    "moreover the divergence in eq.([eq : x2beam ] ) for @xmath62 marks the breakdown of the linearized theory . to explore the quantitative enhancement of the fluctuations and the change of the relevant length and energy scales near criticality",
    ", one has to include the nonlinear terms in the bending energy eq .",
    "(  [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "in order to describe the behaviour near the buckling instability , we insert the fourier expansion eq .",
    "(  [ eq : eigenm ] ) into the corresponding nonlinear hamiltonian . keeping only the fundamental mode ,",
    "since all higher modes have no influence near criticality due to their nonvanishing frequencies , the interacting field theory is reduced to a one particle problem in terms of the coordinate @xmath63 , and its canonically conjugate momentum @xmath64 .",
    "the force term generates a negative contribution to the quartic term in @xmath63 , driving the system unstable .",
    "the nonlinearity in the curvature term , however , over - compensates this and guarantees stability even for fixed length of the beam  @xcite . for clamped boundary conditions one can use the approximate shape @xmath30 which becomes exact near @xmath62 .",
    "one ends up with a quantum mechanical one particle hamiltonian with an anharmonic oscillator potential @xmath65 and an anharmonic coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "a similar effective description of quantum effects near the buckling instability has been derived in  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity there , however , arises from longitudinal stretching while we keep the length of the nanotube fixed .",
    "it is now convenient to define a dimensionless coordinate @xmath67 by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the characteristic magnitude of the deflection , where the quartic term due to the nonlinear bending energy is of the same order than the kinetic energy .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus transformed to a dimensionless form @xmath70 with @xmath71 as the characteristic frequency scale near the critical compression force @xmath57 .",
    "it differs from the fundamental frequency @xmath72 of the classical transverse vibrations by a factor @xmath73 which also determines the size @xmath74 of the critical regime . for swnts with length @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 is of order or smaller than @xmath77 ( see table  [ tab : values ] ) .",
    "the potential energy in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : hdimless ] ) exhibits the standard landau bifurcation from a single to a double well as the external force is increased through its critical value @xmath57 .",
    "indeed our zero dimensional quantum problem is equivalent to a one dimensional classical ginzburg landau theory  @xcite .",
    "let us consider first the mean square displacement at the center of the beam . in the harmonic approximation",
    "this diverges as @xmath6 approaches the critical value from below . for @xmath6",
    "much larger than @xmath57 it is simply determined by the stable minimum of the effective landau energy at @xmath78 giving @xmath79 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : y2happrox ] , the exact result smoothly interpolates between those two limits giving a finite value @xmath80 at @xmath57 , which is of order @xmath81 for typical swnt s ( see table  [ tab : values ] ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is found for the lowest excitation frequency of the beam . in the harmonic approximation it vanishes like @xmath82 . above the critical force",
    "the lowest excitation is the small oscillation in one of the degenerate minima of the anharmonic oscillator .",
    "this is true , however , only in a classical description .",
    "quantum mechanically , the lowest excitation is the exponentially small tunnelsplitting @xmath83 which lifts the degeneracy between the two states localized in the left or right well of the effective potential .",
    "again , the exact numerical result for @xmath84 starts to deviate from the harmonic expression at around @xmath85 and approaches a finite excitation frequency @xmath86 at @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : excenergy ] ) . for @xmath87",
    "it vanishes exponentially in good agreement with the wkb result eq .",
    "(  [ eq : excappr ] ) for the tunnelsplitting @xmath83 .",
    "it is remarkable that the excitation frequency precisely at @xmath57 , which is of order @xmath88 for the parameters of table  [ tab : values ] , is no longer related to the characteristic frequency @xmath72 of the classical problem but scales like @xmath89 , remaining finite only through a genuine quantum effect .",
    "unfortunately , the smallness of the size @xmath90 of the critical regime requires fine tuning the compression force f very close ( @xmath91 ) to its critical value in order to see deviations from classical behaviour near the buckling instability .",
    "in the regime beyond the critical buckling force , the state of lowest energy corresponds to a stationary finite deflection amplitude @xmath92 which is lower in energy by @xmath93 than the configuration with no deflection .",
    "the direction in which the buckling occurs is arbitrary , however , in a realistic setup like that in ref .",
    "@xcite the boundary conditions in the buckled state are likely to break the perfect rotation symmetry assumed in  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the transverse deflection is described by a single degree of freedom with only two degenerate states .",
    "quantum mechanically , these states are split into a narrow doublet with energy separation @xmath94 due to tunnelling . sufficiently far above the critical force",
    "its magnitude may be determined from a wkb - calculation in the anharmonic oscillator potential , giving @xmath95}.\\ ] ] with @xmath96 and @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "note that the validity of the wkb approximation is limited to @xmath98 , above which the zero point energy of a harmonic approximation in one of the energy minima reaches the barrier height . in practice",
    "the perfectly degenerate situation is hardly achieved , introducing some bias energy  @xmath99 which singles out a preferred ground state in which the beam is bent either to the left or right .",
    "we have thus an effective two state system with hamiltonian @xmath100 and eigenenergies separated by @xmath101 , ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the pauli spin matrices ) . in the absence of any asymmetry  @xmath99",
    "its eigenstates are coherent superpositions @xmath104 of the @xmath103 eigenstates @xmath105 and @xmath106 , in which the nanotube is bent towards the left or right .",
    "the two states @xmath105 or @xmath106 are clearly macroscopically distinct  @xcite .",
    "similar to experiments on flux qubits in squid rings  @xcite , the existence of linear superpositions of these states may indirectly be verified by observing the avoided level crossing at  @xmath107 .",
    "such a macroscopic quantum coherence experiment with swnt s requires that the small level splitting @xmath83 can be detected against noise and damping in a mechanical resonance experiment and moreover , that the asymmetry  @xmath99 can be tuned through zero from any accidental nonzero value by external means . as shown in  @xcite , spectroscopy of the transverse vibrations of nanotubes",
    "is in principle possible by applying _",
    "dc_- plus _",
    "ac_-voltages on a charged nanotube .",
    "moreover with a capacitive coupling the bias energy @xmath99 may be changed via an appropriate electrostatic gate potential . due to the still large mass involved ,",
    "the tunnel splitting is rather small ( around @xmath108 for @xmath109 ) , and thus coherent superpositions with an accessible value of @xmath83 require nanotubes close to the buckling instability .    .",
    "characteristic parameters for quantum effects in swnt s of length @xmath110 and diameter @xmath111 .",
    "we assume a young s modulus @xmath112 and an effective wall thickness @xmath113 .",

    "this requires that the quality factor of the swnt in the uncompressed case ( which is related to @xmath116 by @xmath122 ) obeys @xmath123 . for the above value of @xmath124",
    ", this leads to @xmath125 in the relevant regime @xmath126 .",
    "this condition does not seem too stringent for swnts , note that a quality factor of @xmath127 has been reached for si - based resonators in the ghz regime  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed quantum effects in the mechanical properties of single wall carbon nanotubes , in particular zero point fluctuations in the transverse vibrations and the possibility to see the analog of mqc in nanobeams below the euler buckling instability .",
    "while thermal vibrations of clamped swnt s down to lengths @xmath128 have indeed been observed very recently  @xcite , it remains a considerable challenge to measure the tiny zero point vibrations of order 0.1 nm predicted for swnts of length @xmath129 near the buckling instability . with",
    "the sensitivity attained very recently with si - based resonators  @xcite , however , reaching this goal in the near future seems to be quite realistic . as regards the possibility to see the analogue of mqc near or below the euler buckling instability , this requires to tune these systems rather closely below the instability point and doing spectroscopy with both @xmath130- and @xmath131-driving .",
    "provided the methods used for multiwall nanotubes with lengths of several @xmath132  @xcite can be scaled down to clamped single wall nanotubes , quantum mechanics in its literal meaning would finally be of relevance in truly mechanical devices .",
