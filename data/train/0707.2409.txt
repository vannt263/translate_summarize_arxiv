    "the relationship between stellar mass and planet formation rates has been explored theoretically in the context of the core accretion model .",

    "another obstacle that has so far hindered a study of the effects of stellar mass on planet formation is the limited range of masses spanned by doppler  based planet searches . for example , the solar  mass , fgk dwarfs that comprise the bulk of the california and carnegie planet search ( ccps ) span stellar masses from 0.8  to 1.2  @xcite . much more leverage can be gained by measuring the planet occurrence rate around higher mass f and a  type stars ( @xmath17  ) . unfortunately ,",
    "intermediate  mass , main  sequence stars are poor precision doppler targets .",

    "each velocity measurement is assigned a weight constructed from the quadrature sum of the internal measurement uncertainty and a stellar `` jitter '' term .",
    "the internal uncertainty is the weighted standard deviation of the mean velocity measured from each of the @xmath50 2-  chunks in each echelle spectrum .",
    "the stellar jitter term accounts for noise in excess of the internal uncertainties due to astrophysical sources such as rotational modulation of stellar surface features and stellar pulsation @xcite . for sun  like dwarfs , the stellar jitter can be accurately predicted based on the chromospheric diagnostic , given by the ratio of the caiih&k flux to the stellar uv continuum , along with luminosity and @xmath37 color . however , is not calibrated for faint m dwarfs because stars with such cool atmospheres lack a well defined continuum due to molecular line blanketing .",

    "the rms scatter drops from  to   with a resulting decrease in  from  to .    while the quality of the double  planet fit is encouraging , it is still possible that random variability and jitter could conspire to produce a false curvature in our sparse series of measurements .",
    "if this is the case , then the second keplerian and its associated 4 additional parameters are an unjustified embellishment on the single ",
    "keplerian  plus  trend model .",
    "we tested this null hypothesis by employing the scrambled ",
    "residuals false  alarm test described by @xcite .",
    "we first subtract the single  keplerian  plus",

    "we perform a full search for a best  fit keplerian  plus  trend orbital solution .",
    "if the curvature in the original data is an artifact of random noise , then many of the mock data sets should produce lower  than the two  planet fit to the original data .",
    "however , if a second , resolved keplerian signal is present in the observations , then the mock data sets should produce fits that are much worse on average than the original velocities .    the results of our test are shown in figure  [ fap ] .",
    "we generated 1000 mock data sets and found that only 11 produced  equal to or lower than the original velocities , resulting in an false  alarm probability fap@xmath62 .",
    "the 1.1% fap is promising , but we are nonetheless cautious about the validity of this two  planet model . given the relatively low amplitude of the second signal and long period of the two candidate planets , our  measurements provide only 12 independent data points .",
    "the two  planet model is therefore only marginally constrained by our present data .",
    "further , the duration of our observations only covers one orbit cycle of the putative outer companion . at this point",
    "we can only confirm the inner planet , and additional observations are required to verify the exact orbital properties of c.",
    "the mass range encompassed by the california and carnegie planet search target stars provides a large , uniform sample of targets that are ideal for evaluating the effect of stellar mass on the occurrence of jovian planets .",
    "this analysis can be accomplished by simply measuring the fraction of stars with planets in three mass bins : the low  mass m and late k dwarfs with @xmath63  , the sun  like fgk stars with @xmath64  , and the intermediate  mass subgiants with @xmath65  .",
    "we were careful to select planets that could be reasonably detected around stars with a wide range of masses , and for surveys with different time baselines .",
    "our first requirement is that stars have at least 8 observations spanning enough time to search for planets out to a a distance of 2.5  au . using kepler s third law , the orbital period scales as @xmath66 for a fixed semimajor axis .",
    "an orbital distance of 2.5  au roughly corresponds to periods equal to the 3 year duration of the subgiants planet search , as well as the @xmath67 year duration of the nasa keck m dwarfs survey .",
    "next , we exclude stars selected as part of the metallicity  biased next 2000 stars ( n2k ) survey @xcite .",
    "metallicity is an established tracer of giant planets , and we want to isolate the effects of stellar abundance from the effects of stellar mass .",

    "@xcite find that their doppler measurements of subgiants yield a typical precision of @xmath69  .",
    "we therefore include in our analysis only planets with minimum masses @xmath70  . a planet with this minimum mass in a @xmath71",
    "year orbit would represent a 2-@xmath33 detection around a 1.6  subgiant , and would be much easier to detect around a lower  mass star .",
    "our choice of such a large minimum planet mass is conservative since lower  mass planets would be readily detectable in shorter orbits . however , restricting our analysis to planets with masses greater than 0.8  also accomplishes a separate goal .",
    "we wish to test the effects of stellar mass on the formation of _ giant _ planets .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that the formation of planets like jupiter is a threshold process limited by the growth rate of the rocky , embryonic cores .",

    "a total of 803 stars met our stellar mass and planet  detectability criteria .",

    "the occurrence of detectable planets has previously been shown to correlate with stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to test whether the correlation between stellar mass and planet occurrence shown in figure  [ mass_hist ] is real , or merely an effect of an underlying metallicity bias .",

    "this is consistent within errors with the @xmath4% probability that we measure .",
    "for the subgiants , the expected probability is 4.2% , which is a factor of 2 lower than the @xmath5% we measure .",
    "this enhanced planet occurrence around our high  mass stars is significant at the 1.6-@xmath33 level .",
    "the correlation between stellar mass and exoplanets in figure  [ mass_hist ] is most apparent when comparing the bins at either mass extreme .",
    "the high  mass stars in our sample appear to be planet  enriched by a factor 5 compared to the low ",
    "mass m dwarfs , which represents a 2.3-@xmath33 result . however , it is currently very difficult to derive spectroscopic abundances for m dwarfs .",
    "could it be that there is a systematic metallicity bias among our low ",
    "mass stars ?    a common argument for such a metallicity bias among m dwarfs is related to their age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "according to this argument , m dwarfs have lifetimes longer than the age of the galaxy and are therefore more likely than higher  mass stars to have formed in the distant past when the galaxy was metal poor .",
    "this argument is based on the assumption that there is a well  defined age ",
    "metallicity relationship in the galaxy .",
    "however , studies of galactic chemical evolution have shown that no well  defined correlation between age and metallicity exists in the thin galactic disk .",
    "analyses of the local stellar population show that stars have a wide range of abundances at ages from 1 to 10 gyr , with a 0.2 dex scatter in [ fe / h ] over this age range .",
    "similarly , open clusters with comparable ages also exhibit a wide range of metallicities , with 3 to 6 gyr clusters differing by as much as 0.82 dex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further , late g and all k  type stars also have lifetimes comparable to the age of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , any metallicity bias present in our sample of m dwarfs should also be present in a volume  limited sample of g and k dwarfs .",
    "we therefore find no compelling reason to suspect that the abundances of m dwarfs should deviate significantly from the g and k stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "our sample of m dwarfs within 15  pc of the sun should trace the metal abundances of the other stars in the immediate solar neighborhood .",
    "the volume  limited sample of @xcite has a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath81 .",
    "this is roughly the abundance we expect for our sample m dwarfs .",
    "we stress that , contrary to the argument above , our sample of m dwarfs is not metal  poor compared to other nearby stars .",
    "rather it is the solar  mass stars and subgiants among the planet search targets that are slightly metal rich compared to a volume  limited sample .",
    "this effect has been previously noted by @xcite and is related to the fact that in a given range of @xmath37 colors metal  rich stars are brighter and more likely to be included in the samples of most doppler  based planet searches ( see also * ? ? ? * for a more detailed discussion . ) .    based on our estimate for the mean metallicity of our sample of m dwarfs ( [ fe / h]@xmath81 ) , equation  [ planetprob ]",
    "predicts a 2.4% planet occurrence rate for the stars in our low  mass bin .",
    "this prediction is slightly higher than our measured occurrence rate of @xmath3% , but the two values agree within errors .",
    "we can use the probabilities predicted by equation  [ planetprob ] to correct our measured occurrence rates for the effects of stellar metallicity .",
    "each corrected planet fraction , @xmath82 , is constructed as    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the original planet fraction , @xmath85 is the expected probability for solar metallicity , and @xmath86 is the predicted probability from equation  [ planetprob ] .",
    "similarly , the corrected uncertainty in each bin is    @xmath87    the filled circles in figure  [ mass_hist ] show the corrected values and uncertainties of the planet occurrence rate in each mass bin . after correcting for metallicity",
    ", the contrast between the low  mass and high  mass bins is diminished .",
    "however , evidence for an increasing trend remains : the a  type stars have a factor of 2.5 higher planet occurrence rate than the m dwarfs .",
    "it is important to note that the corrected occurrence rates in figure  [ mass_hist ] do not account for the decreased sensitivity of our doppler survey of subgiants compared to the surveys of lower  mass stars .",
    "our requirement of 8 or more observations was exceeded in most cases by the stars in the solar  mass and low  mass bins .",
    "the solar  mass stars had on average 21 observations each , and the m dwarfs averaged 16 observations .",
    "on the other hand , the subgiants had an average of only 10 observations each .",
    "also , whereas our typical doppler precision is @xmath882   for solar  mass stars @xcite and 34  for m dwarfs ( figure  [ keck_stable ] ) , the subgiants typically have a precision of 47  due to their larger jitter @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of our measurements of subgiants is further diminished since the amplitude of a star s reflex motion caused by a planet with a given mass and orbital period scales as @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the measured planet occurrence rate for the stars in our high ",
    "mass bin represents a lower limit rather than an absolute measurement of the true fraction of subgiants with planets ( as indicated by the upward  facing arrow in figure  [ mass_hist ] ) , even after correcting for metallicity .",
    "we present the detection of a jupiter  mass planet orbiting the m3.5 dwarf .",
    "this detection marks the sixth m  dwarf known to harbor at least one doppler  detected planet , together with gj876 @xcite , gj436 @xcite , gj581 @xcite , gj849 @xcite and gj674 @xcite .  is the only third m dwarf out of roughly 300 surveyed known to harbor a jovian planet .",
    "in addition to our firm detection of a jovian planet with @xmath89  days , we also detect evidence of a possible second jovian planet in the system near @xmath1  days .",

    "from the first 6 planet detections around low  mass stars , it appears as though m dwarfs have an 80% occurrence rate of multi  planet systems , compared to the 30% rate measured for fgk stars @xcite .",
    "the high frequency of multi  component detections around m dwarfs may be in part due to the increased detectability of planets around low  mass stars .",
    "this is likely the case for the triple neptune system around gj581 .",
    "the `` c '' component in that system would have induced a velocity amplitude of only 1.4  if it orbited a 1  star . however",
    ", the enhanced detectability of planets around m stars should nt matter as much for the systems containing jovian planets since all of the giant planets orbiting m stars would be detectable around solar  mass stars .",
    "we studied the relationship between stellar mass and the occurrence rate of giant planets by combining our sample of m dwarfs with our samples of solar  mass fgk stars and intermediate  mass subgiants . by measuring the fraction of stars with planets in three stellar mass bins",
    "we find that the frequency of planets with @xmath90  within @xmath91  au increases with stellar mass ( figure  [ mass_hist ] ) .",
    "the retired a ",
    "type stars in our sample are nearly 5 times more likely than m dwarfs to harbor a giant planet .",
    "this important result establishes stellar mass as an additional sign post for exoplanets , along with metallicity . just as metallicity informs the target selection of searches for short  period planets ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , stellar mass will be an important factor in the target selection of future high ",
    "contrast direct imaging surveys .",
    "while the lower luminosities of m dwarfs provide favorable contrast ratios that facilitate the detection of thermal emission from young giant planets , our results show that a  type stars are far more likely to harbor such planets .    in order to understand the role of stellar mass on planet formation ,",
    "it is important to disentangle the known effects of stellar metallicity from our stellar sample . after correcting for metallicity in each mass bin ,",
    "the slope of the trend in figure  [ mass_hist ] is slightly diminished .",
    "however , the factor of 2.5 increase in planet occurrence around a stars compared to m dwarfs remains significant , especially considering that the high  mass bin is uncorrected for the relatively lower detection sensitivity of the subgiants planet search .",
    "our results therefore confirm the prediction of the core accretion model that higher mass stars should form jovian planets more efficiently @xcite .",
    "our discovery confirms and expands upon the recent results of @xcite , who are searching planets around intermediate ",
    "mass k giants . by focusing on stars in open clusters , they are able to control for the age and metallicity of their sample and determine accurate stellar masses . because of the larger stellar radii and lower precision ( jitter  @xmath92  ) of k giants , they focused on planets with @xmath93  and @xmath94  au .",
    "@xcite find that the occurrence rate of `` super  jupiters '' and brown dwarfs within this mass and semimajor axis range increases with stellar mass , rising from 0% for m dwarfs to 2.5% for evolved a stars .",
    "the high  mass sample of stars analyzed by @xcite contained primarily stars with masses @xmath95  . in order to avoid confusion with horizontal  branch stars ( `` clump giants '' )",
    "we have restricted our subgiants planet search primarily to stars with absolute magnitudes @xmath96 , corresponding to masses @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "our planet search is therefore complementary to the survey of @xcite and other planet searches around k giants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the k giants provide information about massive planets around stars with @xmath98  , and the relatively stable atmospheres of subgiants ( jitter  @xmath99  ) allow us to detect planets beyond 1 au with minimum masses down to @xmath100  .    our preliminary results and those of @xcite",
    "reveal a positive correlation between the mass of stars and the likelihood that they harbor giant planets .",
    "however , testing the exact shape of the relationship predicted by the simulations of @xcite  a rising trend of planet occurrence up to a peak near 2.5  and a decreasing trend toward higher masses  will require a much larger sample of stars .",
    "we have expanded our search for planets around intermediate ",
    "mass stars by adding 300 additional former a and f stars to our lick and keck samples . the results from our expanded planet search should reduce the error bar on the high  mass bin in figure  [ mass_hist ] by a factor of 2 .",
    "if the 9% occurrence rate for @xmath101  is confirmed , then our expanded planet search will result in the detection of 2030 new planets orbiting some of the most massive planet host stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "in addition to verifying the preliminary results presented here , these planet detections will also allow us to study the effects of stellar mass on other planet characteristics such as eccentricity , semimajor axis and minimum mass .",
