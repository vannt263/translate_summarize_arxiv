    "<S> introduction *    quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high density , relevant to the physics of the early universe , compact stars and relativistic heavy ion collisions , is presently attracting a renewed attention from both nuclear and particle theorists . </S>",
    "<S> following an early suggestion by bailin and love  @xcite , it was recently stressed that at large quark density , diquarks could condense into a color superconductor  @xcite , with potentially interesting and novel phenomena such as color - flavor locking , chiral symmetry breaking , parity violation , color - flavor anomalies , and superqualitons .    </S>",
    "<S> at large density , quarks at the edge of the fermi surface interact weakly thanks to asymptotic freedom . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high degeneracy of the fermi surface causes perturbation theory to fail . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , particles can pair and condense at the edge of the fermi surface leading to energy gaps . </S>",
    "<S> particle - particle and hole - hole pairing ( bcs effect ) have been extensively studied recently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particle - hole pairing at the opposite edges of the fermi surface ( overhauser effect )  @xcite has received little attention with the exception of an early variational study by deryagin , grigoriev and rubakov for a large number of colors  @xcite , and a recent renormalization group argument in  @xcite . the scattering amplitude between a pair of particles at the opposite edges of the fermi surface peaks in the forward direction , a situation reminiscent of the forward enhancement in compton and bhabha scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> in retrospect , it is surprising that the overhauser effect in qcd has attracted so little attention . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the schwinger model  @xcite shows that when a uniform external charge density is applied , the electrons respond by screening the external charge and inducing a charge density wave , a situation analogous to a wigner crystal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations apply to qcd in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite . in 3 + 1 </S>",
    "<S> dimensions , dense skyrmion calculations with realistic chiral parameters yield a 3-dimensional wigner - type crystal with half - skyrmion symmetry at few times nuclear matter density  @xcite . at these densities , </S>",
    "<S> fermi motion is expected to be overtaken by the classical interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a close inspection of these results shows the occurrence of scalar - isoscalar , pseudoscalar - isovector and vector - isoscalar charge density waves in an ensemble of dense skyrmions .    in this paper we will show that in dense qcd , the equations that drive the particle - hole instability at the opposite edge of a fermi surface resemble those that drive the particle - particle or hole - hole instability in the scalar - isoscalar channel , modulo phase - space factors . in section 2 </S>",
    "<S> we motivate and derive a wilsonian action around the fermi surface . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain expressions for the energy densities and pertinent gaps in the @xmath10 channel with screening , thereby generalizing the original results in  @xcite . in section 4 </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the decoupled equations for large chemical potential without screening . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of screening for arbitrary @xmath11 as well as temperature are discussed in section 5 , in overall agreement with a recent renormalization group argument  @xcite . in section 6 </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the overhauser effect in qcd in lower dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions and suggestions are given in section 7 .    </S>",
    "<S> cm    * 2 . effective action at the fermi surface *    to compare the overhauser effect to the bcs effect </S>",
    "<S> , we will construct a wilsonian effective action by integrating out the quark modes around the fermi surface , in the presence of smooth bilocal fields . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative would be the quantum action  @xcite . at large chemical potential , most of the fermi surface is pauli - blocked , so the quasiparticle content of the theory is well described by such an action . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , our analysis should provide a useful alternative to a brute - force lattice qcd analysis . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an effective formulation of lattice qcd along the lines of the heavy - quark formalism is possible and will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we have omitted gauge - fixing terms and ghost - fields . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we will analyze ( [ s1 ] ) in the one - loop approximation with the gluon field in the feynman gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation , as we shall show below , is equivalent to the resummation of the ladder graphs in the particle - particle or particle - hole graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of screening will be dealt with by minimally modifying the gluon propagator , ignoring for simplicity vertex corrections as in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the issue of gauge fixing dependence will be briefly discussed at the end .    in the one - loop approximation with screened gluons , </S>",

    "<S> the screened gluon propagator @xmath20 is @xmath21 perturbative arguments give @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the debye mass , @xmath25 is the magnetic screening generated by landau damping and @xmath26 the number of flavors  @xcite   abusively as the magnetic screening mass . ] . </S>",
    "<S> nonperturbative arguments suggest @xmath27 @xcite where for simplicity , the difference between electric and magnetic channels is ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xmath28 in the case @xmath29 , as lattice simulations for the gluon propagator at finite @xmath16 are not yet available . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the perturbative screening vanishes at large @xmath11 .    to proceed further with ( [ s3 ] ) we need to fierz rearrange the @xmath30 term in ( [ s3 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath39 is the vertex generator for particle - hole pairing in the @xmath10 channel ( i.e. , overhauser ) , while @xmath40 is the vertex generator for particle - particle and hole - hole pairing in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) channel ( i.e. , bcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> only these two operators will be retained below , unless specified otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon - propagator in matter is @xmath41 the weightings follow from minimal substitution in matter with 2 electric and 2 magnetic modes . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the present fierzing is particular , since it selects solely the @xmath42 in the @xmath43 channel and the @xmath44 in the @xmath45 channel  @xcite . for arbitrary @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 become , respectively , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where the single factors refer , in turn , to the results of the color fierzing , the flavor fierzing and , of course only for the second expression , the fierzing related to color - flavor locking  </S>",
    "<S> , a locking can be achieved by fierzing the antisymmetric tensor in color times the corresponding one in flavor into the tensor @xmath52 with the pertinent weight @xmath53 in the combined color - flavor space . </S>",
    "<S> the latter operator has @xmath54 eigenvalues @xmath55 , @xmath56 eigenvalues @xmath57 , one eigenvalue @xmath58 , and @xmath59 eigenvalues 0 , where @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the bcs case , the fermion determinant ( [ s15 ] ) acquires the color - flavor weight @xmath61 , while the corresponding value in the overhauser case is the standard @xmath62 factor . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite where color and flavor are uncoupled and only the two - flavor case is considered ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the corresponding coefficient is just @xmath70 , since the flavor - fierzing factor can be ignored , as it eventually cancels against a corresponding factor resulting from the fermion determinant . </S>",
    "<S> note , furthermore , that our color - flavor coupling scheme is different from the one recently introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for arbitrary numbers of flavors . ] . </S>",
    "<S> this brings about the important issue of whether fierzing is a unique operation on 4-fermi interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is no  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this nonuniqueness would of course not be important if an all - order calculation were to be performed for any fierzing set , but is of course relevant for truncated calculations as is the case in general . </S>",
    "<S> each fierzing corresponds to summing a specific class of ladder diagrams in the energy density , see e.g.  @xcite .    introducing a hermitian bilocal field @xmath71 and a non - hermitian bilocal field @xmath72 , we may linearize the fierzed form of the @xmath30 term by using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , e.g. @xmath73    { \\cal d}(x - y )     \\left[\\bar{\\psi}(y)\\psi(x)\\right ] \\right ) } \\nonumber\\\\     & = & \\int d\\sigma(x , y)\\ </S>",

    "<S> the result is the following effective action for the bilocal fields @xmath76 where @xmath77 the factor of @xmath78 in ( [ s12 ] ) is due to the occurrence of @xmath79 and @xmath80 through the fierzing into @xmath42 and @xmath81  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this renders naturally the gorkov formalism applicable to the present problem even at @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with the subscripts @xmath85 short for color , flavor and dirac . </S>",
    "<S> we should stress that the effective action ( [ s12 ] ) is general . </S>",

    "<S> this is particularly relevant for pairings with large energy gaps which are expected to take place at a few times nuclear matter density  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our effective action is better suited to the use of variational approximations as discussed in  @xcite , and leads naturally to exact integral equations by variations , especially in the presence of interactions with retardation and screening . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , for instantons the cutoff is fixed from the onset by their inverse size . as we have shown here </S>",
    "<S> , the overhauser pairing , much like the bcs pairing by magnetic forces  @xcite , relies on scattering between pairs in the forward direction that is kinematically suppressed in the transverse directions ( in fact exponentially suppressed  @xcite ) . since the instanton interaction is nearly uniform over the fermi sphere , we expect a geometrical enhancement in the bcs pairing in comparison to the overhauser pairing . </S>",
