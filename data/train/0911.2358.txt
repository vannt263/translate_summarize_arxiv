    "in jiuquan of gansu province , people could observe the whole course of eclipse happening . in beijing",
    ", people could also watch the partial solar eclipse clearly . around this event ,",
    "the sun was in a quiet phase between solar cycle 23 and 24 .",
    "there was no solar flare , no corona mass ejection ( cme ) , no sunspot , and no any active regions .",
    "the solar disk looked like a fairly clean plate .",
    "such total eclipse might provide a god - given opportunity to test the quiet sun atmospheric models by means of radio observations . during this solar eclipse",
    ", we made an extensive broadband spectral radio joint - observations at jiuquan and beijing huairou .",
    "section 2 introduces the observed instruments and the related data processing .",
    "section 3 is a deduction of the quiet sun atmospheric model from the above data . and",
    "some discussions and conclusions make up the final part of the paper .",
    "the joint - observation included a solar total eclipse and partial eclipse observations .",
    "the solar total eclipse observations were carried out at jiuquan with a broadband spectrometer ( hereafter , ecbs / jiuquan ) in the frequency range of 2.00  5.60 ghz@xmath4}$ ] . however , because of instrument problems , we only obtained a segment of valid data in the frequency of 3.60  5.60 ghz .",
    "the telescope was a newly updated instrument manufactured just before july of 2008 with an aperture of 2.40 m , not of very good performance .",
    "the status of the telescope tracking the sun was recorded by a small ccd camera , connected to a small optical telescope and a computer .",
    "they were in - phase with the radio receiver by an gps system .",
    "the axes of the ccd camera and the radio telescope were parallel to each other .",
    "the time cadence was about 10 pictures per second .",
    "figure 1 presents the results of the ccd monitoring and the occulted information at three different times .",
    "the time cadence of the recorded radio data was 7.5 ms .",
    "this means that , in each segment of 7.5 ms the receiver would do a whole scan in the frequency range of 2.0  5.60 ghz and recorded them , and it makes a recorded unit .",
    "each recorded file includes 4 mb data in about 8000 recorded units .",
    "however , as a result of the missing and disordered data , each recorded file included actually about 6000  7000 valid recorded units .",
    "the time length in each recorded file was about 3.0  7.00 s with the averaged value about 5.59 s. as the magnitude of the fluctuation among the recorded units was very strong , we might integrate them into each recorded file .",
    "as for the frequency bandwidth , we might integrate them into 28 mhz at each channel .",
    "the solar radio partial eclipse observation is made by the chinese solar broadband radiospectrometer ( sbrs / huairou ) in beijing huairou in the valid frequency range of 2.60  3.80 ghz and 5.20  7.60 ghz@xmath5}$ ] .",
    "the time cadence of the recorded data was integrated into 0.2 s , and the frequency bandwidth at each channel was 10 mhz in the range of 2.60  3.80 ghz and 20 mhz in the range of 5.20  7.60 ghz .",
    "the performance of sbrs / huairou was in good status .",
    "as for the solar total eclipse at jiuquan , the first optical contact was at 10@xmath616@xmath736.5@xmath8 ut with the solar photospheric radius 945.5 arcsecond and the lunar radius 978.1 arcsecond , and the totality began at 11@xmath613@xmath741.4@xmath8 ut and ended at 11@xmath615@xmath721.8 ut .",
    "the maximum phase was at 11@xmath614@xmath731.7@xmath8 ut , the eclipse factor was 1.034477 , the solar photospheric radius is 945.5 arcsecond , the lunar radius is 978.1 arcsecond , and the distance between the solar disk center and the lunar center was 12.95 arcsecond .",
    "the last contact was at 12@xmath608@xmath724.0@xmath8 ut with an altazimuth low to 4.4 degree .",
    "however , as the antenna could not follow the sun s track after 11@xmath645@xmath7 ut , we could not get the radio observations after that time . as for the partial eclipse at huairou , beijing ,",
    "the first optical contact was at 10@xmath616@xmath736.1@xmath8 ut with the solar photospheric radius 945.5 arcsecond and the lunar radius 977.7 arcsecond .",
    "the maximum phase was at 11@xmath609@xmath723.2@xmath8 ut with an eclipse factor of 0.910905 , and with the solar photospheric radius 945.5 arcsecond and the lunar radius 974.7 arcsecond , and the distance between the solar disk center and the lunar center 190.04 arcsecond .",
    "the last contact was at 11@xmath659@xmath711.3@xmath8 ut , much after the sunset ( the corresponding sunset time at huairou station was about 11@xmath628@xmath7 ut ) .",
    "so , we could not get the observation data about the partial eclipse after the maximum phase .",
    "the calibration and data processing method follow the ref.[5 and 6 ] . before and after the period of eclipse ,",
    "the calibrating observations are made and and the emission measure of the sky background along the sun s routine corresponding to the solar eclipse is taken . as the sun was in its quiet phase ,",
    "the polarization of radio emission was very weak .",
    "it is unimportant to differentiate the right circular polarized emission ( rcp ) and the left circular polarized emission ( lcp ) .",
    "this work adopted the total emission intensity ( rcp+lcp ) .",
    "as the instrument of sbrs / huairou was aging , while the telescope of ecbs / jiuquan was a new instrument , the signal fluctuation was fairly strong .",
    "we make a broad averaging with the data .",
    "so our result is smoothed one ( as for the data of ecbs / jiuquan , we make averaging in each recorded file , so the integrated time is about 3  7 s with the mean value of 5.59 s ; as for the data of sbrs / huairou , we make averaging in each segment of 3.2 s ) . at the same time , as the period of the eclipse was very close to the sunset , it s hard to remove the disturbances coming from the subaerial factors .",
    "+         in this work we mainly focus on the processes occurring at around the first radio contact of the moon s limb to the solar disk .",
    "we select three segments of frequency to form a successive broadband observations with frequency of 2.60  7.60 ghz .",
    "the first ( 2.60  3.80 ghz ) and third ( 5.20  7.60 ghz ) segment were obtained at sbrs / huairou , while the second segment ( 3.80  5.60 ghz ) was observed by ecbs / jiuquan .",
    "figure 1 shows the solar radio eclipse curves which includes the jiuquan total eclipse ( left and right panels ) and the huairou partial eclipse ( middle panel ) .",
    "the region marked with * m * between two vertical solid lines in the left panel is most likely to be a disturbance from some unknown terrestrial factor .",
    "figure 2 presents the solar radio eclipse slope curves one by one with figure 1 .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines in the left panels indicate the zero level of the slopes .",
    "the vertical solid lines in the left and right panels indicate the time of the first optical contact and the maximum phase of the partial eclipse , respectively . while the vertical solid lines in the middle panels indicate the time of the first optical contact and the totality phase of the total eclipse , respectively .",
    "all of the solid thick curves in figure 1 and figure 2 are smoothed in brand slide windows which reflect the main tendency of the solar radio eclipse curves and the radio eclipse slope curves .",
    "generally , from the solar radio eclipse curves we can get the time of the first radio contact and determinate the solar radio radii@xmath9}$ ] .",
    "however , from figure 1 we can find that the fluctuation of the radio eclipse curves is fairly strong .",
    "it is not easy to determine the exact time of the first radio contact of the eclipse just from the solar radio eclipse curves ( dashed lines in figure 1 ) , even if from the smoothed curves ( solid thick lines in figure 1 ) . here ,",
    "we apply the solar radio eclipse slope curves ( figure 2 ) to obtain the relatively exact time of the first solar radio contact .",
    "the following is the basic working principle : the telescope antenna is always pointed to the center of the solar disk , before the first radio contact .",
    "the receiver gets the whole solar radio emission , and the slope curves should be approximated to a horizontal line around zero ; from the beginning of the eclipse ( first contact ) , when the receiver gets less and less solar radio emission with the increasing of the solar disk occulted by the moon , the slope curve will become negative .",
    "then we may define the intersection point between the smoothed slope curve and the zero horizontal line as the time of the first solar radio contact of the eclipse .",
    "the arrows in figure 2 indicate the time of the first solar radio contact of the eclipse at each frequency , with corresponding values ( @xmath10 ) listed in table 1 .    based on @xmath10",

    "we find that the curve is most likely to be a beeline .",
    "we operate a best linear fit and get a linear function :    @xmath27    here , the unit of solar radio radius @xmath11 is in solar photospheric radius ( @xmath15 ) , and the frequency @xmath28 is in ghz .",

    "the bright temperature at each frequency is also listed in table 1 , and plotted in figure 3 .    as mentioned in section 1 , the sun was in its quiet phase .",

    "we make a broad averaging with the data .",
    "the error of solar radio radii ( @xmath11 ) , bright temperature ( @xmath26 ) , and electron plasma density ( @xmath37 ) can be expressed as : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
