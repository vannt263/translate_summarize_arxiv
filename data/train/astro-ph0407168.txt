    "low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are binary systems in which a compact object  either a neutron star or a black hole",
    " accretes matter from a low  mass companion star .",
    "many of these systems are found to be transient , so called soft x ",
    "ray transients ( sxts ) .",
    "several hundreds have been found in our own galaxy ( see ) and many of the x  ray point sources in other galaxies are likely to be lmxbs as well ( @xcite ) . however , some of these x  ray sources in other galaxies have luminosities in excess of the eddington limits of both neutron star and ten solar mass black hole ( bh ) lmxbs ( cf .  ) .",
    "these systems are thought to contain intermediate mass bhs ( @xcite ) or stellar mass bhs where the emission is anisotropic ( @xcite ) or indeed super  eddington ( @xcite ) .",
    "determining the distance to lmxbs is important , e.g.  to determine the peak or quiescent luminosity and to determine if the compact object in lmxbs receives an ( asymmetric ) kick velocity at birth or not .",
    "typically , a large distance to the galactic plane implies the occurrence of a kick , unless the systems at large z  distances were formed in the halo .    in this paper",
    "we collect distance estimates from the literature and discuss possible systematic trends related to the used distance estimation methods ( section 2 ) . in section 3",
    "we discuss the implications for the galactic distribution of ( bh ) lmxbs and the galactic population of ultra  luminous x  ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "for most bh sxts it is not feasible to obtain a trigonometric parallax measurement . instead the distance generally is determined by comparing the derived absolute @xmath4band magnitude with the ( dereddened ) apparent magnitude , taking into account a possible contribution from residual accretion ( the distance derived using this method is sometimes called a photometric parallax ) .",
    "a first guess of the distance can be obtained by assuming that the absolute magnitude is that of a main  sequence star of the observed spectral type , after determining the best ",
    "fit spectral type from the data , e.g.  via the optimal extraction technique ( see @xcite for a description of this technique ) .",
    "we call this method @xmath5 . however , ideally , the radius , spectral type , and luminosity class are determined directly from the data .",
    "we denote this method @xmath6 .",
    "the observations give the orbital period , p , the radial velocity of the donor star , k@xmath7 and , by comparing the donor star spectrum with templates that are doppler broadened , the rotational velocity of the donor ( v@xmath8 ) .",
    "the inclination can be estimated from modelling the ellipsoidal variations in the light curve . from kepler s third law and the assumptions that the donor fills its roche lobe and",
    "is in co  rotation with the orbit , all system parameters can be determined as follows .",
    "the mass function and inclination relate the masses of the two components , while a combination of kepler s law and the equation for the volume of the roche  lobe gives @xmath9^\\frac{1}{3}$ ] ( e.g.  @xcite ; q is defined here as the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary ) , giving an independent estimate of q thus providing the system parameters .",
    "the radius can be estimated from @xmath10 . alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath11 or the inclination are not known , a quite good estimate of the radius can be obtained using the fact that the mean density of a roche  lobe filling star depends only on the orbital period ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radius of the donor star can be estimated via @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is in hours , @xmath14 in solar masses , and @xmath15 in units of solar radii ) .    in order to estimate the absolute magnitude one either uses the surface brightness for the observed spectral type or colour , as given e.g.  by @xcite and or uses the determined radius and effective temperature , together with an appropriate bolometric correction .",
    "alternatively , one uses the fact that for given surface brightness the observed flux scales with the angular diameter ( 2 r / d ) , which together with the radius gives the distance .",
    "however , there are ( small ) differences in surface brightness for different luminosity classes of the same spectral type .    in case of gro",
    "j165540 and grs  1915 + 105 , @xcite and @xcite , respectively determined limits on the distance from the observed proper motion for receding and approaching blobs , assuming the jet ejections are intrinsically symmetric and noting that the maximum velocity of the ejections is the speed of light .",
    "we list this method as method @xmath16 .",
    "the distance can also be estimated using the interstellar absorption properties of the source .",
    "there are different ways to do this . for several interstellar absorption lines and diffuse interstellar bands",
    "the observed equivalent width correlates with colour excess ( cf .  ) .",
    "the colour excess can be converted in a distance estimate ( e.g.  using the calibration of @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to compare the observed extinction to that of ( ob ) stars in the observed field for which the distance is known or can be derived ( e.g.  ) . the distance can also be constrained by using high  resolution spectroscopic observations of the interstellar absorption lines to trace individual gas clouds and their velocities . assuming that the apparent velocities of the different gas clouds are projected galactic rotation velocities , a lower limit on the distance of the object can be found ( cf .",
    "we refer to distances derived using the interstellar absorption properties as method @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we note here that various other methods to estimate the distance to bh sxts have been proposed and used .",
    "we do not discuss these in detail but we merely mention some of them : @xcite used the normalisation of a model describing the accretion disc flux , used the transition between the high / soft and low / hard x  ray states , and @xcite proposed to use the normalisation of the radio  x  ray correlation in the low / hard state as a distance indicator .    in table",
    "[ disbhc ] we show the distance estimates in the literature based on method @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for sources for which the best estimate of the mass of the compact object is above the upper limit of the neutron star mass of @xmath18 m@xmath19 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "below , we briefly discuss the sources listed in table  [ disbhc ] for which disparate values for the distance exist in the recent literature .

    "furthermore , @xcite showed that considering the burst peak fluxes of 61 photospheric radius expansion bursts in the atoll source 4u  172834 the degree of anisotropy in the burst emission in less than 2 per cent .",
    "two out of the eight neutron star systems studied by have a photospheric radius expansion peak burst luminosity that is lower than that of the other six .",
    "this lower peak luminosity is consistent with the eddington luminosity limit for hydrogen rather then helium  rich material for a neutron star mass of 1.4 m@xmath19 .",
    "so , for some of the neutron star systems in our list we could have overestimated the distance by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "if we take a 1:4 ratio as was found by this would affect 8 systems in our sample . as was noted by the two sources",
    "whose peak luminosity is consistent with hydrogen accretion have an orbital period characteristic for normal lmxbs , rather than ultra  compact x  ray binaries with periods less than @xmath221 hour ( which necessarily accrete hydrogen poor material e.g.  @xcite ) . because the fraction of ultra  compact x  ray binaries in globular clusters might be higher than in the field , the ratio between the number of sources with a hydrogen  rich , low eddington burst luminosity and the number of sources with a helium  rich",
    ", high eddington burst luminosity could be higher .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the distances to _ all _ neutron star lmxbs in our sample have been overestimated .",
    "e.g.  in the long period lmxbs ks  173126 and 4u  163653 the photospheric radius expansion burst was consistent with a helium  rich explosion ( @xcite , @xcite , respectively , see also @xcite ) .",
    "using the data set compiled above , leaving the distances derived using method @xmath6 as they are , keeping the discrepancy in the distance estimate between method @xmath6 and the radius expansion burst method in mind , we investigate the galactic distribution of neutron star and bh lmxbs and the peak luminosity of bhs .",
    "@xcite investigated the galactic z  distribution of neutron star lmxbs and concluded that neutron stars should receive an asymmetric kick at birth from the fact that the rms value of the z  distribution was @xmath23 kpc .",
    "we obtain an rms z  values of 1025 pc and 1125 pc for persistent and transient neutron star lmxbs , respectively ( we round rms z  values to the nearest 25 pc ) . in this",
    "we have excluded xte  j2123058 since with a z  value of -12.4 kpc it would dominate the outcome and @xcite show that the systemic velocity is consistent with it being a halo source . it can be argued on the basis of the large z values that cyg  x2 and exo  0748676 are also halo sources although this is much less clear . e.g.  @xcite argue that if cyg  x2 is at a distance of @xmath2211.6 kpc it could have originated in the galactic plane . however , when we also exclude cyg  x2 and exo  0748676 we find an rms z ",
    "value for the persistent and transient neutron star lmxbs of 700 pc and 850 pc , respectively .",
    "@xcite found an rms  z value of @xmath22500 pc when they excluded cyg  x2 and exo  0748676 from their sample .",
    "since we have used 3.8@xmath24 erg s@xmath25 for the eddington luminosity for the radius expansion peak luminosity for all neutron stars , the rms z  value we derived for neutron star lmxbs corresponds to an upper limit .",
    "if we use 2.0@xmath24 erg s@xmath25 as the photospheric radius expansion peak burst luminosity we find an rms z  value of 775 pc and 850 pc for persistent and transient neutron star lmxbs , respectively ( here we only excluded xte  j2123085 , if we also exclude cyg  x2 and exo  0748676 we find 550 and 650 pc for persistent and transient neutron star lmxbs , respectively ) .",
    "i.e.  our findings confirm the result of @xcite .    in a follow  up paper , @xcite investigated the differences between the rms values of the neutron star and bh lmxbs z  distributions .",
    "they found that the rms value for the bhs was substantially lower than that of the neutron star z  distribution ( more than a factor 2 ) . using the distances of the bhs given in table  [ disbhc ]",
    "we now find an rms  value of @xmath22625 pc ( we took a distance of 2.5 kpc for gro  j0422 + 32 ; we excluded the likely halo object xte  j1118 + 480 ; @xcite [ although note that some of the evidence leading to the suggestion that xte  j1118 + 480 is a halo object was based on the low rms z  value @xcite found for bh lmxbs ] ) , i.e.  close to the upper limit we find for the neutron star systems .",
    "increasing the distance of xte  j1550564 with a factor 3 does not significantly increase the rms value of the bh population .",
    "the main reason for the difference between the findings of @xcite and our findings is that the distance estimates for most bhs have gone up .",
    "the conclusion drawn by @xcite that bhs receive a significantly smaller kick than neutron stars is no longer tenable .",
    "we plotted the z values for transient and persistent neutron star lmxbs ( open diamonds and squares , respectively ) and bhs ( black dots ) using the distances from table  [ disbhc ] and  [ nsdist ] as a function of their projected distance to the galactic centre in figure  [ yztot ] .",
    "it is interesting that the rms value for the projected distance to the galactic centre for the neutron stars and bh is 4.8 kpc and 7.0 kpc , respectively ( excluding the [ likely ] halo sources ) . because the galactic potential in the z  direction decreases with increasing galactocentric radius ( e.g.  @xcite ) the larger scale height of bhs",
    "can partly be due to this effect , rather than a kick velocity .",
    "e.g.  for neutron star systems @xcite estimate an rms value of the z  distribution near the sun of 650 pc .",
    "furthermore , the symmetric kick velocity ( imparted due to mass loss in the supernova ) scales with the companion mass and the mass lost in the supernova ( e.g.  ) both can be ( much ) larger in the case of bh systems , but it scales inversely with the total mass of the remaining binary .",
    "lastly , for large asymmetric kick velocities the binary is more likely disrupted in case of a neutron star than a bh .",
    "a detailed investigation of all the possible explanations for the high rms value for the bhs is needed in order to draw firm conclusions and we defer this to a later paper .    , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the cartesian coordinates in the galactic plane ( see figure  [ xytot ] ) .",
    "the location of the sun at an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc is indicated with an open circle , and the location of the galactic centre is indicated with a cross .",
    "four neutron star systems fall off the figure ( exo  0748676 , z=-3.1 kpc , xte  j2123058 , z=-12.4 kpc , xte  j1710281 , d@xmath2819.7 kpc , and cyg  x2 , d@xmath2815 kpc ) . in this figure",
    "we use the neutron star distances derived assuming the eddington peak burst luminosity was 3.8@xmath24 erg s@xmath25.,width=302 ]         after @xcite we also compare the distribution of the l and b coordinates of the neutron star and bh lmxbs .",
    "we first compare the l and b coordinates of neutron star lmxbs in table  [ nsdist ] with those of the bhs listed in table  [ disbhc ] . a k  s test shows that the probability that the distributions are the same is 18 per cent for the l coordinate and 52 per cent for the b coordinate ( the k ",
    "s d  value is 0.33 and 0.24 , respectively . here and below : the effective number of data point is always larger than 10 so that the probabilities we quote are quite accurate , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to investigate this further and to minimise selection effects",
    ", we plot the l and b coordinates of _ all _ neutron star systems , e.g.  systems where a burst was found , and pulsars listed in ( solid line histogram in figure  [ ldist ] ) .",
    "we compare this with the bh sources listed in table  [ disbhc ] _ and _ the bh candidates for which no mass estimate based on a radial velocity study exist ( systems in table 3 in @xcite ; the dashed line histogram in figure  [ ldist ] ) .",
    "a one  dimensional k  s test shows that the probability that the neutron star and bh distributions in l are drawn from the same distribution is 37 per cent whereas the probability that b values are drawn from the same distribution is 90 per cent ( the k ",
    "s d  value is 0.19 and 0.12 , respectively ) .",
    "hence , using a larger sample of neutron stars and bhs makes the probability that the neutron star and bh distributions are the same larger .",
    "the probabilities we derive are higher than those derived by @xcite ; a difference we attribute to the fact that @xcite had fewer bh systems in their study .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for a difference in the l and b distributions of neutron star and bh lmxbs .",
    "interestingly , there seems to be an excess of 12 out of a total of 22 bh and an excess of 19 out of a total of 45 neutron star systems with -30@xmath29 over systems with 0@xmath3 .",
    "there is an excess of 5 out of 35 bh and 13 out of 53 neutron star systems with -10@xmath30 and 0@xmath31 ( see figure  [ ldist ] ) .",
    "the expected mean number of systems with a positive / negative l of a symmetric distribution around l=0@xmath32 is @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the total number of systems .",
    "the variance on this number is @xmath35 . comparing this with the observed number of systems yields significances of the observed asymmetries of 2.8@xmath36 for the neutron star distribution in l , 3.0@xmath36 for the bh distribution in l , and 3.8@xmath36 for the combined neutron star and bh distribution in l. the combined significance for the neutron star and bh distribution in b is 1.9@xmath36 only , so we do not discuss this apparent asymmetry in b further .",
    "the asymmetry in the l ",
    "distribution is not an obvious observational selection effect .",
    "for instance , the bepposax wfc monitoring the galactic centre region had a field  of  view of @xmath37 centred on the galactic centre ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dust maps from @xcite do not show a large dust asymmetry around the galactic centre .",
    "it seems that the neutron star and bh lmxb distribution in l is symmetric around l=-5@xmath32 .",
    "possibly this asymmetry is related to the bar structure in the inner part of our galaxy .",
    "it is known that the bar causes asymmetries in the stellar and gas distributions around ( l , b ) = ( 0,0 ) ( e.g.  see the recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the distribution of lmxbs follows the stellar mass distribution , and hence not the spiral arm structure .",
    "using the distances listed in table  [ disbhc ] and  [ nsdist ] we also plot in figure  [ xytot ] the galactic x  y distribution of the neutron stars for which a photospheric radius expansion burst was observed and the bhs for which a dynamical mass estimate has been derived .",
    "the galactic spiral arm structure according to the model described in @xcite has been overplotted .",
    "it is clear that few lmxbs at the other side of the galactic centre have been detected , especially if the eddington limit for hydrogen rich material for a 1.4 m@xmath19 neutron star is applicable to the peak burst flux of most photospheric radius expansion bursts ( see also ) .",
    "there also seems to be a paucity of nearby neutron star lxmbs ( this was also noted by @xcite ) . in order to try to quantify this we performed a two dimensional kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( k  s ) test ( @xcite ) to test whether the neutron star and bh populations are the same .",
    "the k  s test gives a d of 0.45 and a probability that the two populations are the same of 3.8 per cent .",
    "if we decrease the distance of all neutron star systems by a factor @xmath38 the probability that the distributions are the same increases only slightly to 5.2 per cent ( d=0.44 ) .",
    "it is possible that the discrepancy in the spatial distribution of the neutron stars and bhs is a selection effect .",
    "since we only included bhs for which a mass limit larger than 3@xmath39 has been derived , the optical counterpart must have been detected in quiescence , hence this favours nearby systems .",
    "the bh distances are important for the maximum observed bh luminosity .",
    "we found a somewhat larger distance for v404  cyg than often used previously .",
    "@xcite found an upper limit on the distance of v404 cyg of 3.7 kpc assuming the peak outburst source luminosity was eddington limited taking their 90 per cent confidence upper limit to the mass of the bh of 15 m@xmath19 .",
    "the distance of 4.0@xmath0 kpc we find shows that the maximum observed luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity for a 10 m@xmath19 bh ( the limit often quoted to decide whether a source is a ulx or not ) .",
    "the distance derived for xte  j1550564 may have been underestimated by as much as a factor 3 : its distance could be as large as 3@xmath40 kpc , although the uncertainties are large .",
    "for this distance the outburst peak luminosity in the 220 kev band alone would be 7@xmath41 erg @xmath42 s@xmath25 ( taking the flux from @xcite ) . for 4u  154347 , sax  j1819.32525 and grs  1915 + 105 , systems for which the distance was determined by method @xmath6 , @xmath6 , and @xmath16 , respectively , it was noticed earlier that the outburst peak luminosities are super ",
    "eddington for the best ",
    "fit bh masses ( cf .  ;",
    "@xcite show that the peak outburst of gro  j100945 most likely also exceeded the eddington luminosity for a for @xmath43 bh ( even if the distance is 5.7 instead of the 9 kpc they favoured ) .",
    "it seems therefore likely that there are several sources in our own galaxy which we would classify as transient ulxs had we observed them in other galaxies . for these sources",
    "a mass determination has shown that they are not intermediate mass bhs but rather 515 m@xmath19 bhs .",
    "furthermore , the fact that lmxb sources ( an old population ) seem to be capable of producing super  eddington luminosities could also help explain the presence of ulxs in elliptical galaxies .",
    "assuming that most ulxs are stellar mass bhs the fact that many ulxs are found a few arc seconds away from the young stellar clusters could be caused by kick velocities received at bh formation .",
    "if super  eddington luminosities were to be explained by effects of `` mild  beaming '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) then one would naively expect the inclinations of the sources with the highest luminosities to be lowest . in figure  [ incli ]",
    "we plot the inclination distribution for 13 bh sxts in figure  [ incli ] ( the inclinations for gx  3394 and xte  j1859 + 226 are not well known and those sources have therefore not been included ; inclinations from @xcite ) .",
    "although the amount of sources is low we see that the inclination distribution of the bh ulx sources is not skewed to low inclinations but instead clusters around the fiducial 60@xmath32 point .",
    "we did not include xte  j1550564 ( @xmath44 ) and gro  j0422 + 32 ( @xmath45 ) as ulxs .",
    "we studied the distance estimates for bh sxts in detail .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in the distance estimates due to e.g.  uncertainties in the spectral type ( i.e.  temperature ) of the companion star are probably large . comparing the distances derived for the neutron stars cyg  x2 and xte  j2123058 using the distance estimation method @xmath6 , which is used for most bh sxts , with the photospheric radius expansion burst method , we find that the latter gives larger distances .",
    "this could mean that for some reason method @xmath6 systematically underestimates the distance .",
    "possibly this is related to an erroneous spectral classification of the companion star caused by its fast rotation .",
    "if this is indeed the case this would have important consequences for the reported difference in quiescent x  ray luminosities of bh and neutron star sxts , for the bh sxt peak outburst luminosities , for the bh masses , and for the galactic distribution of bh lmxbs .",
    "we find that the distance towards xte  j1550564 may have been underestimated by as much as a factor 3 because the interstellar extinction could have been overestimated in that case .",
    "as was noticed before , several bh sxts observed in our galaxy would be classified as ulxs had we observed them in another galaxy ( at least 5 but perhaps even 7 out of the 15 dynamically confirmed bh sxts ) .",
    "this suggests that many ( transient ) ulxs in other galaxies could well be stellar mass bhs .",
    "a re  evaluation of the distance to the galactic plane of neutron star and bh lmxbs shows that there is no longer evidence for a smaller rms  value of the z  distribution for bh systems .",
    "such a difference had been interpreted as evidence for the absence of asymmetric kicks during bh formation . however , before firm conclusions can be drawn about the similarities or differences between neutron stars and bh kicks the details of the formation and galactic distribution have to be investigated .",
    "finally , we found that the l distribution of galactic lmxbs is asymmetric around l=0@xmath32 .",
