    "a relative fractal drum @xmath0 generalizes the notion of a bounded subset of @xmath2 and is defined as an ordered pair of subsets of @xmath2 where @xmath1 is nonempty and @xmath3 is of finite @xmath4-dimensional lebesgue measure satisfying a mild technical condition .",
    "the lapidus ( or distance ) zeta function of @xmath0 is then defined as the lebesgue integral @xmath5 for all @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is sufficiently large , where @xmath8 denotes the euclidean distance from @xmath9 to @xmath1 .",
    "its main property is that the _ abscissa of convergence _ @xmath10 of @xmath11 coincides with the upper box dimension of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the integral converges absolutely and defines a holomorphic function in the open half - plane @xmath13 . for the study of relative fractal drums , their corresponding fractal zeta functions and the general higher - dimensional theory of complex dimensions",
    "see @xcite along with the survey articles @xcite .",
    "this higher - dimensional theory generalizes the well known theory of geometric zeta functions for fractal strings and their complex dimensions developed by michel l. lapidus and his collaborators in the last two decades ( see @xcite and the relevant references therein ) .    in the case",
    "when the set @xmath1 degenerates to the point at infinity , we will denote this new kind of relative fractal drum with @xmath14 . in this case",
    "it is clear that the fractal properties of such a relative fractal drum will depend only on the set @xmath3 .",
    "we will extend the notions of minkowski content and box dimension for such relative fractal drums and define a new class of lapidus zeta functions associated to them .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown that this new class of lapidus zeta functions has analogous properties as in the case of ordinary relative fractal drums and hence , provides an analytic approach to the study of fractality of unbounded sets .",
    "the motivation to study the fractal properties of unbounded sets comes from a variety of sources .",
    "in particular , the notion of `` unbounded '' or `` divergent '' oscillations appears in problems in oscillation theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , automotive industry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , civil engineering ( see , e.g , @xcite ) and mathematical applications in biology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unbounded ( divergent ) oscillations are oscillations the amplitude of which increases with time .",
    "for instance , the oscillations of an airplane that has positive static stability but negative dynamic stability is an example of divergent oscillations that appears in aerodynamics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    furthermore , unbounded domains themselves are also interesting in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations .",
