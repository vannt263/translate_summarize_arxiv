    "we searched for co(10 ) emission from seven lsb galaxies using the bima array .",
    "three of the galaxies are large spirals ; ugc  5709 , ugc  6614 and f568 - 6 ( malin  2 ) .",
    "the remaining four are relatively smaller galaxies with irregular disks ; they are ngc  5585 , ugc  4115 , ugc  5209 and f583 - 1 .",
    "the bima maps suggested the presence of co(10 ) emission in two galaxies , ugc  6614 and f568 - 6 . using the iram 30 m telescope we detected molecular gas in the disks of both galaxies and in the nucleus of f568 - 6 .",
    "these observations show that molecular gas in lsb galaxies is present in their disks as well as their nuclei , but the distribution is localized over isolated regions and hence difficult to detect .",
    "we have also detected millimeter continuum emission from the nucleus of ugc  6614 .",
    "the emission has a flat spectrum in the 1.4 to 110  ghz range and is from the agn in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "1300 + 0144 ( or pgc045080 ) is a giant lsb galaxy that is close to edge on and has a bright nucleus and faint bar .",
    "we have detected and mapped the radio continuum emission at 1.4  ghz , 610  mhz and 320  mhz using the gmrt at pune .",
    "the spectral index is -0.7 and the emission is extended about the nucleus .",
    "the emission is most likely due to the agn and appears as lobes / jets ; the core is not detected however and may be self absorbed .",
    "the hi gas distribution is asymmetric about the nucleus and appears lopsided .",
    "there is a dip in the hi distribution on the approaching side which is apparent in the hi map and spectrum .",
    "the disk rotation velocity flattens at @xmath0 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "observations with the bima millimeter - wave array are partially supported by nsf ast-0228974 .",
    "we are grateful to the members of the iram staff and also to the gmrt staff for help in observations .",
    "this research has made use of nasa/ ipac infrared science archive , hyperleda database and the first survey ."
