    "field studies of desert dune dynamics commonly focus on investigating feedback mechanisms between topography , windflow forcing , spatial and temporal dynamism in sand flux , and resulting erosion / deposition at the surface @xcite .",
    "such studies have endeavoured to model the contemporary mechanics of simple dune shapes ( with an emphasis on barchanoid forms ) from fluid mechanics principles .",
    "however , progress in our understanding has been hampered by measurement complications resulting from the distortion of flow due to acceleration and the practical difficulty of measuring shear velocity @xmath2 within the near - surface inner - layer @xcite where changes in shear stress are assumed to be significant for sand flux @xcite .",
    "further , there is the conceptual difficulty in applying linear fluid mechanics analysis ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also review by @xcite ) to dune topographies that are relatively steep and incorporate a brink .",
    "such topography forces flow separation and generates turbulent fields that lie beyond the strict applicability of the linear theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast , modellers have approached the question of dune dynamics from the perspective of theoretical physics , with identification and description of the different physical ingredients necessary to reproduce dunes of different shapes @xcite .",
    "research on the linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed submitted to a constant wind @xcite has revealed the importance of two key mechanisms that must occur in the case of flow over topography , and which are at the origin of dune initiation and growth .",
    "these are , ( i ) the upwind phase shift of the point of maximum basal shear stress with respect to dune topography and , ( ii ) the spatial lag in sand transport response to changing shear stress  termed ` saturation length ' @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these theoretical approaches are similar to those employed in subaqueous research on ripples and dunes @xcite .",
    "the advantage garnered by the analytical modelling approach is that research effort is directed towards the initiation of dunes from flat surfaces , rather than toward understanding the mechanics of existing dune morphologies , as is the case with the geomorphological field studies . in this way",
    ", the modelling approach stays within the applicable limits of the linear theory , at least in the initial stages of dune development .",
    "the two key mechanisms of the upwind phase shift in velocity and the spatial sand flux lag have been largely overlooked in geomorphological field studies which have focussed on mature dune forms , which do not conform to the linear analysis .",
    "further , geomorphological field studies have tended to focus on the measurement of broad windflow patterns at the dune - scale ( establishing flow acceleration patterns , for example ) rather than the subtle intricacies of the sub - metre scales of the hydrodynamic phase shift and sand flux lag .",
    "a single wind tunnel investigation provides the only measured data for the sand flux lag @xcite . here the value for the lag was shown to be of the order of @xmath4  m. however , there are no measured data to support the hypothesis of an upwind phase shift in basal shear stress in the aeolian case .",
    "this lack of data is a hindrance to furthering our understanding of sand dune initiation and growth .",
    "some measurements are available in the subaqueous environment from flumes ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) although these are in the transitional regime between laminar and turbulent flow .",
    "numerical calculations of the phase shift are also in this transitional regime @xcite .",
    "only one in - direct measurement of basal shear stress ( established from velocity data ) is available in the fully turbulent regime but this is also derived from the subaqueous environment @xcite .",
    "data investigating the structure of the flow over topography are available for the aeolian environment but these are all restricted to the non - linear regime @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the first field evidence of the existence of the phase shift of the point of maximum wind speed upwind of a dune crest , a theoretical requirement for dune initiation and growth .",
    "the experiment is carried out on a low dune with a dome topography in order to remain within the linear regime but in fully turbulent conditions .",
    "together with data on the spatial relaxation of sand transport in response to wind velocity variations ( @xmath3 ) our measurements of the upwind phase shift are the first to substantiate these key controls at the origin of the dune instability and initiation mechanism .",

    "our field site was located on the western edge of the erg oriental near merzouga , eastern morocco ( 31@xmath903.103  n , 04@xmath900.133  w ) , and to the south of a large star dune complex @xcite .",
    "the study dune was an elongated dome , with no avalanche slip face showing that no flow separation occurred .",
    "the surrounding landscape consisted of similar dunes , all lying on flat ground , which was dry and mostly devoid of vegetation .",
    "the dune was typically @xmath10  m long parallel to the wind direction with a height of around @xmath11  m. in fig .",
    "[ expsetup]a , we display a schematic plan view of the dune .",
    "the dune sand had an average particle size of @xmath12  @xmath13 m as determined by laser granulometry .",
    "the surrounding surface consisted of poorly sorted gravel in a sand matrix ( grain size is mostly distributed in the range 200500  @xmath13 m ) . this minor change in surface roughness between the upwind plain and dune surface",
    "is not considered significant with respect to the near - surface ( below @xmath7  m high ) windspeed measurements described below .",
    "we established measurement sites along the centre - line of the dune parallel to a wind blowing from a compass bearing of 74@xmath9 between 1000 and 1400 on 23 april 2011 . in order to capture the subtle variations in velocity that we were expecting in the crest area of the dune ,",
    "measurement sites here were established at @xmath7  m intervals whereas sites on both the extreme upwind and downwind flanks of the dune were established at between @xmath4 and @xmath14  m intervals .",
    "the topography of the centre - line of the dune was surveyed using standard levelling techniques to an accuracy of approximately @xmath4  cm .",
    "two parallel measurement transects , approximately @xmath15  m apart , were set up ( see fig .  [",
    "expsetup]a ) .",
    "one transect was dedicated to measurement of surface change with small brochette sticks inserted vertically at each site into the sand to act as erosion pins .",
    "the height of each exposed pin was measured both at the beginning and end of the experiment with a tape measure to an accuracy of @xmath16 mm .",
    "these measurements provided data on the amount of erosion or deposition evident on the dune surface during the @xmath17  hours of the experiment and , when integrated over the distance between pins , provided an assessment of sand flux .",
    "the second measurement transect was dedicated to wind velocity measurements .",
    "two anemometer arrays were deployed , each consisting of three switching cup anemometers ( vector a-100r ; accuracy @xmath18  m s@xmath19 , distance constant @xmath20  m ) at heights of @xmath21  m , @xmath5  m and @xmath6  m ( see fig .  [",
    "expsetup]b ) .",
    "these heights were chosen to coincide with the airflow zones within , at and above the calculated inner - layer depth ( see below ) .",
    "each anemometer array was sampled every @xmath8  s with data recorded by campbell cr10x dataloggers . in analysis",
    "the velocity data were averaged over a @xmath8  minute period .",
    "one anemometer array served as a reference site and was established permanently at the crest of the dune during the course of the experiment and at a distance of @xmath22  m from the measurement transect ( see fig .",
    "[ expsetup]a ) . in fig .",
    "[ expsetup]c , we show the velocity time series , corresponding to the upper ( @xmath7  m ) reference anemometer .",
    "we can see that during the @xmath17 hrs of the experiment the wind conditions at the reference site were relatively stable .",
    "wind velocity at @xmath7  m height peaked at @xmath23  m s@xmath19 , with an average of @xmath24  m s@xmath19 and an rms value of @xmath25  m s@xmath19 .",
    "the second ( mobile ) anemometer array was erected at each measurement site in turn for a period of @xmath8  minutes .",
    "wind velocity data gained from the mobile array ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 from bottom to top respectively ) were then normalised by data measured at the same height and time at the reference array ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) as a ratio ( e.g. @xmath32 ) .",
    "next to the reference anemometer array , a sensit saltation impact sensor was established .",
    "the sensit incorporates a piezo - electric transducer which records the impact of saltating sand grains as they bounce across the surface , thus providing data on the presence or absence of sand transport @xcite .",
    "an example of the output from the sensit is shown in fig .",
    "[ windtransport]c .",
    "data from the sensit established that during the course of the experiment saltation transport occured for @xmath33 of the time .",
    "this suggests that the wind speeds we were measuring were above the critical entrainment threshold for erosion and therefore were significant for the evolving dynamics of the dune .",
    "in both wind tunnel and atmospheric turbulent flows , the velocity @xmath34 , averaged over the relevant time defined below , increases logarithmically with vertical distance from the surface @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the von krmn constant ; @xmath2 is the shear velocity , corresponding to a basal shear - stress @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the air density ; the aerodynamic roughness , @xmath40 , due to the presence of a transport layer or of aeolian ripples , is typically of the order of a fraction of a millimeter . in accordance with a wind velocity of the order of @xmath14  m s@xmath19 at @xmath41  m ( fig .",
    "[ expsetup]c ) , the shear velocity evident in this study was approximately @xmath7  m s@xmath19 .",
    "importantly , the turbulent mixing time - scale at height @xmath35 is proportional to the inverse of the velocity gradient , and therefore scales as @xmath42 .",
    "this sets the time - scale over which the measurement of @xmath34 should be averaged to effectively get the profile ( [ uzero ] ) from the surface to a height @xmath35 .",
    "for example , the logarithmic profile establishes over a thickness of @xmath43  cm above the surface in a fraction of second . in wind tunnels ,",
    "the integral turbulent time - scale is of the order of @xmath4  s , and therefore the shear velocity extracted from the velocity profile for @xmath44  cm , averaged at that time - scale , is well defined .",
    "however , the integral turbulent time - scale of atmospheric flows is much longer , typically around @xmath8 to @xmath45  minutes . @xmath2",
    "similarly extracted from eq .",
    "[ uzero ] is then found to be time dependent . this shear velocity is recovered from the turbulent velocity fluctuations @xmath46 ( at the kolmogorov scale ) , measured at a centimetric distance to the bed , by averaging @xmath47 over a time - window of the order of @xmath4  s.    sediment transport ( here saltation ) has its own time scale : because of grain inertia , the grain flux responds to a change of flow velocity over a time scaling as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the density of the grains , which gives , here , an order of magnitude of @xmath4  s @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of this time - scale with that of the wind tunnels makes the observed relationship between sediment flux and shear velocity well defined . with field data , a good correlation between transport and wind can also be found ( fig .",
    "[ windtransport ] ) when all quantities are measured at the relevant time and length scales : here both anemometer and grain impact sensor are located a few centimetres above the surface , and their signal is averaged over @xmath8  s.    s and measured over one hour .",

    "an estimation of the thickness @xmath51 of this layer is related to the horizontal wavelength @xmath52 of the relief by the scaling law @xcite : @xmath53 we estimate the thickness @xmath51 for the dune under study ( @xmath54  m , see below ) in the range @xmath45@xmath55  cm . as a consequence",
    ", the height at which the velocity is measured must be within this layer in order to extract the time - dependent @xmath56 relevant to sediment transport .",
    "this is the case for our bottom anemometer , placed at @xmath57  cm .",
    "the elevation profile of the dune on which wind velocity and erosion rates were measured is shown in fig .",
    "[ elevationprofile ] .",
    "although the entire surface profile is not sinusoidal , the shape of the dune itself can be approximated by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is set at the position of the dune crest .",

    "a more refined analysis would involve the computation of the fourier transform of the dune profile , in order to account for a whole range of wavenumbers @xmath66 .",
