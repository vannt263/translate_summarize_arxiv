    "since schwinger s one - loop calculation  @xcite leptonic anomalous magnetic moments have usually been used for precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "very precise recent experimental measurements of the electron anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite @xmath4\\ ] ] and the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite @xmath5\\ ] ] give a possibility to look further for allusive `` new physics '' .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 is the most precise experimental value , which provides a determination of @xmath7 , the fine structure constant  @xcite : @xmath8,\\ ] ] with an accuracy of more than an order of magnitude better than the independent measurements  @xcite @xmath9,\\\\      \\label{valuecs }      \\alpha^{-1}\\left(cs\\right)&=&137.036\\,000\\,00(110)~[7.7~{\\rm ppb}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is this fact that limits at present testing the @xmath10 prediction .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath11 persists to show a deviation in comparison with the sm prediction  @xcite . to be more definitive we choose a little bit conservative , but the most recently updated value  @xcite @xmath12 which shows 2.8  @xmath13 standard deviation .    remarkably , this difference exceeds by an order of magnitude the biggest uncertainties from the hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and it is two times larger than the sm electroweak contribution .",
    "the latter fact is apparently in some conflict with the viable at present `` natural '' conception that new physics contributions are induced by quantum loop effects , rather than at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the mass limits set by lep and tevatron , it is highly non - trivial to reconcile the observed deviation with many of the new physics scenarios . only the @xmath14 enhanced contributions in susy extensions of the sm for @xmath15 and/or large enough @xmath14 may explain the `` missing contribution '' .    based on this approach it is generally expected , that contributions to the leptonic anomalous magnetic moment are proportional to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the scale of the new physics .",
    "it leads to the conclusion , that @xmath18 is more sensitive to new physics . the @xmath19 relative enhancement for the muon more than compensates for the factor of @xmath20 current experimental precision advantage of @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we consider a model , which allows to generate a contribution of the new physics to the leptonic anomalous magnetic moment at _ the tree level_. moreover , the contribution exhibits _ a linear _ rather than quadratic dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "it changes drastically the situation with the relative sensitivity to new physics of the muon versus the electron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath21 can not anymore compensate the advantage of @xmath22 over @xmath23 , which results in a much larger sensitivity of @xmath3 to the new physics than was expected so far .",
    "in this paper we are going to investigate the physical consequences of interacting spin-1 massive bosons described by a formalism of the second rank antisymmetric tensor fields .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian , which has been successfully used already during more than two decades in the chiral perturbation theory , has the form  @xcite @xmath24 using the canonical formalism it can be shown  @xcite that the lagrangian describes the evolution of the three physical degrees of freedom of the vector @xmath25 , while the three unphysical components of the axial - vector @xmath26 do not propagate and they are frozen .",
    "although on the mass shell such description of the spin-1 massive bosons is equivalent to the usual formalism , using vector proca fields @xmath27 , off - shell they have different unphysical states and can , in general , lead to different physical effects .",
    "for example , the gauge - like yukawa coupling of the vector field to the bilinear vector combination of the fermion fields @xmath28 leads to the well - known static coulomb interaction due to the exchange of the unphysical degree of freedom @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the antisymmetric tensor field , possessing a richer structure of the unphysical states than the vector field , can give birth to new physical effects due to its coupling to a corresponding fermion current .",
    "a simple generalization of the yukawa coupling ( [ yv ] ) in the case of the antisymmetric tensor field reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the antisymmetric hermitian matrix .",
    "it is interesting to note , that despite intensive utilization of the original yukawa interactions for describing the higgs boson couplings or the gauge interactions ( [ yv ] ) , the interaction ( [ yt ] ) still does not have broad phenomenological applications .",
    "here we would like to discuss one of its consequences .",
    "since the quantum numbers of the physical degrees of freedom of the vector field @xmath32 ( here latin indices run over @xmath33 ) and the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath34 are the same , they can mix .",
    "indeed , the quantum loop corrections ( see fig .",
    "[ rad ] )    ( 200,70)(-45,20 ) ( 52,50 ) ( 32,50)(40,0)2 ( 52,70)(1,0)1 ( 52,30)(-1,0)1 ( 74,50)(8,0)4(4,5)[t ] ( 78,50)(8,0)4(4,5)[b ] ( 0,49)(0,2)2(1,0)32 ( 2,57 ) @xmath35 ( 89,57 ) @xmath36 ( 8,43)(75,0)2(1,0)10 ( 10,35)(75,0)2@xmath37    generate the following additional mixing term @xmath38 to the total lagrangian of the interacting vector and antisymmetric tensor fields . here",
    "@xmath39}\\ ] ] is the effective mass parameter , which leads to the nontrivial mixing between the antisymmetric tensor field and the vector field in the case of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the summation in ( [ mchi ] ) is performed by all fermion flavors @xmath40 , which couple simultaneously to the tensor antisymmetric field and to the vector field , and have also nonzero mass terms @xmath41 .",
    "an important property of such mixing consists in the gauge invariant form of the coupling ( [ mix ] ) for the vector field @xmath27 .",
    "this allows to preserve the gauge invariance of the free lagrangian @xmath42 and the zero mass term for the vector field , where as usual @xmath43 is the gauge invariant field strength tensor .",
    "the resulting mixing between the antisymmetric tensor field and the vector field is dynamical one , since it depends on the momentum transfer @xmath44 . in general",
    ", it leads to very complicated expressions for the physical states after diagonalization .    in our case",
    "it is simplified by the physical conditions of very small momentum transfers , which we are going to discuss .",
    "the second simplification comes from an assumption of a smallness of the mixing parameter @xmath45 in comparison with very heavy boson mass @xmath46 , so that their ratio is negligibly small . in this case",
    "the only dominating term in the lagrangian , including contributions from ( [ vmn ] ) , ( [ mix ] ) and ( [ l0v ] ) , is the mass term from ( [ vmn ] ) and the procedure of diagonalization consists in a simple rearrangement of the terms @xmath47    therefore , the physical vector field @xmath48 is defined up to the normalization factor . however",
    ", such transformation does not lead to a physically observable effect , since it reduces effectively to a redefinition of the coupling constant @xmath49 . on the other side ,",
    "the physical antisymmetric tensor field @xmath50 is defined by the inhomogeneous transformation , which results in the appearance of the anomalous coupling from the interaction ( [ yt ] ) @xmath51 and the corresponding anomalous magnetic moment for the fermion field @xmath52",
    "in the previous section we have shown , that an additional contribution from the new physics to an anomalous magnetic moment of the fermion can be generated at the tree level .",
    "the role of a new physics here is played by the non - trivial coupling ( [ yt ] ) of the massive spin-1 boson , described by the antisymmetric tensor field , to the fermion tensor current .",
    "this coupling leads inevitably to the mixing ( [ mix ] ) between the known gauge fields , such as the photon , and the new hypothetical spin-1 heavy boson .",
    "the smallness of the mixing parameter @xmath45 and the heaviness of the new boson mass @xmath46 could be the reasons why their effects and the direct production of such particles have not been registered up to now .",
    "probably the only places where such effect could be tested in low - energy physics are the very precise measurements of the anomalous photon couplings to the leptons , namely electron and muon .",
    "therefore , the difference ( [ da ] ) between the predicted and the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon may be explained _ completely _ by the new mechanism , if the following identification holds @xmath53    unfortunately , the only one experimentally measured value can not fix separately each of the three new parameters @xmath54 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "nevertheless , our predictions can be more definitive , if we make an additional assumption about the universality of the new yukawa coupling constant @xmath55 .",
    "let us assume , that by an analogy with the gauge coupling @xmath49 , which is the same for different fermion generations , the new coupling @xmath55 also possesses the universality condition @xmath56    in this case the contribution of the new physics to the anomalous magnetic moment of the lepton @xmath57 depends linearly on the lepton mass , where the coefficient @xmath58 is assumed to be universal for each lepton species .",
    "therefore , we are in position now to make a definitive prediction for a new physics effect on the electron anomalous magnetic moment @xmath3 . the linear ( [ al ] ) rather than quadratic dependence on @xmath2 results in a huge effect due to the new physics on the determination of the fine structure constant @xmath7 via @xmath3 .",
    "so , according to the formula ( [ al ] ) there should be an additional contribution @xmath59 to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron from the new physics , which is well above the non - qed contributions @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xcite and the experimental precision @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "if we subtract the additional contribution ( [ dae ] ) from the experimentally measured value @xmath63 ( [ expae ] ) , this results in a lower value of the fine structure constant than the extracted one ( [ alpha ] ) . indeed we predict , that the inverse value of @xmath7 should be on @xmath64 greater than presently accepted ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , our prediction can not be verified at present , because the independent @xmath7 determinations ( [ valuerb],[valuecs ] ) have uncertainties comparable with the contribution ( [ dalpha ] ) .    beside of the description of the absolute value of the difference between the predicted and measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , it is interesting also to predict its sign .",
    "it could be done in our framework , if we make further assumptions .",
    "let us assume , that the new massive boson interacts only with the _ down_-type fermions and , by an analogy with the electric charge , all coupling constants @xmath65 have the same sign . in this case the generated coefficient ( [ mchi ] ) in the mixing term multiplied by the ratio @xmath66 results in the positive constant @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , it confirms that the experimental value for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is higher than the predicted one .",
    "it is interesting also to note that if the new boson exists and it is not too heavy , @xmath68  tev , it may be observed in the drell  yan process at the lhc .",
    "in this paper we have considered the alternative scenario for a contribution by the new physics to the leptonic anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the key role in this scenario belongs to a new massive spin-1 boson , which is described by a second rank antisymmetric tensor field .",
    "the latter has new non - minimal tensor interactions with fermions that lead to its mixing with the photon in the case of a chirally broken symmetry .",
    "therefore , the initial wave functions of the antisymmetric tensor field and the photon can be expressed through linear combinations of their physical states , which results in the appearance of a direct anomalous photon coupling to the fermions at the tree level .    in the case of universality of the new tensor interactions",
    "the contribution of the new physics to the anomalous magnetic moment of the lepton depends linearly on the lepton mass .",
    "this leads to a higher sensitivity of the electron anomalous magnetic moment to the new physics than was expected before .",
    "the latter fact may substantially affect the extraction of a real value of the fine structure constant from @xmath3 .",
