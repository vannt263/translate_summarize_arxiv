    "next , we prove that if @xmath43 is any squarefree word over @xmath30 having no occurrences of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 , then @xmath40 is squarefree .",

    "* this can be verified with a short computation .",
    "the only @xmath61 for which @xmath131 holds nontrivially are @xmath143 but none of @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath105 are prefixes of any @xmath132 . *",
    "if @xmath146 then no two distinct letters share a prefix of length @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath147 then @xmath148 , and no two distinct letters share a suffix of length @xmath25 . hence @xmath149 , @xmath150",

    "the rest of the proof is exactly parallel to the proof of theorem  [ first ] , with the following exception .",
    "when we get to the final case , where @xmath104 is divisible by @xmath72 , we can use lemma  [ ming2 ] to rule out every case except where @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "thus @xmath160 for some string @xmath161 .",
    "this special case is ruled out by the following lemma :    suppose @xmath161 , and let @xmath160",
    ". then either @xmath43 contains a square , or @xmath43 contains an occurrence of one of the subwords @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 .",
    "this can be verified by checking ( a ) all strings @xmath43 with @xmath162 , and ( b ) all strings of the form @xmath163 , where @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "( here @xmath166 may be treated as an indeterminate . )",
    "it now remains to show that if @xmath43 is squarefree and contains no occurrence of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , then @xmath125 is cubefree .",
    "if @xmath125 contains a cube @xmath167 , then it contains a square @xmath126 , and from what precedes we know @xmath122 .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ second ] is now complete .    if @xmath115 and @xmath14 are defined as above , then @xmath181 is cubefree , and avoids all squares @xmath0 with @xmath1 .",

    "every binary word of length @xmath182 contains a cube or a square @xmath0 with @xmath183 .",
    "this may be proved purely mechanically .",
    "more generally , let @xmath184 be a set of subwords to be avoided .",
    "we create and traverse a certain tree @xmath185 , as follows .",
    "the root of the tree is labeled @xmath186 . if a node is labeled @xmath19 and contains no subword in @xmath187 ,",
    "then it has children labeled @xmath188 for each @xmath11 ; otherwise it is a leaf of @xmath185 .",
    "this tree is infinite if and only if there is an infinite word avoiding the elements of @xmath187 .",
    "if @xmath185 is finite , then the height of @xmath185 gives the length @xmath189 such that every word of length @xmath189 or greater contains an element of @xmath187 .",
    "the tree can be created and traversed using a queue and breadth - first search .",
    "if the set @xmath187 is symmetric under renaming of the letters  as it is in this case  we may further improve the procedure by labeling the root with any particular letter , say @xmath190 .",
    "when we run this procedure on the statement of the theorem , we obtain a tree with 289 leaves , the longest being of length @xmath191 .",
    "the unique string of length @xmath192 starting with @xmath190 and avoiding cubes and squares @xmath0 with @xmath183 is @xmath193 .",
    "it is also natural to wonder if a result like corollary  [ jcor ] holds if `` cubefree '' is replaced with `` overlap - free '' .",
    "it does not , as the following result shows .    any infinite overlap - free word over @xmath29 contains arbitrarily long squares .    by",
    "we know that if @xmath194 is an overlap - free infinite word over @xmath195 , then there exist a word @xmath196 and an overlap - free infinite word @xmath197 such that @xmath198 , where @xmath21 is the thue - morse morphism . by iterating this theorem",
