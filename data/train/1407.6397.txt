    "the interaction between the spins of charge carriers and magnetic moments of both magnetic planes attached to the zigzag terminations of the nanostructure is parametrized by exchange energy @xmath27 .",
    "as mentioned , the coupling involves only the spins of the charge carriers present at zigzag terminations for even values of @xmath5 ( and the number of such sites at each termination is @xmath28 ) .",

    "at the beginning it is instructive to study some properties of the graphene nanostructures in question without including the interaction with magnetic planes .",
    "this involves in particular the influence of the electric field on the charge and spin distribution . since the magnetic planes are attached to the outermost parts of the zigzag terminations of the structures ( to the lattice sites with even values of @xmath5 ) , it is most interesting to analyse the concentration of charge carriers particularly at these lattice sites .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] for various values of external electric field in a nanostructure characterized by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 the distribution of charge is homogeneous .",

    "the charge density at the symmetry axis ( @xmath2 ) remains insensitive to the field , while the most pronounced changes occur at the edges of the nanostructure ( @xmath56 ) , where they are first observable for weak field .",
    "close to the field of @xmath57 , we deal with almost linear dependence of charge density on distance , as the edge near the negative potential gate is almost completely free from electrons , while at the opposite side , near the positive potential gate the electronic density is almost doubled .",

    "it is visible that at the site located at the symmetry axis of the nanoribbon , for @xmath2 , the electronic density is completely untouched by the external electric field . for the sites closer to the gate with negative potential the electronic density deceases , while the opposite changes occur at the sites located closer to the gate possessing positive potential . for the sites located at @xmath58 , the changes are symmetric with respect to the value of @xmath59 .",
    "when the sites located closest to the edge ( @xmath56 ) are considered , the dependence remains linear up to @xmath60 , and then abrupt jumps of electronic density occur .",

    "the spin densities at sites @xmath58 are identical , thus full symmetry with respect to the nanostructure axis @xmath2 is present . up to @xmath62",
    "there is no spin polarization at the considered sites .",
    "however , at this field value , a range of nonzero spin polarization builds up and preserves up to @xmath66 .",
    "this happens simultaneously for all the sites , however , the values of spin polarization are much higher for @xmath2 and @xmath61 than for the sites numbered by odd @xmath5 values .",
    "this observation is particularly important in context of the fact that the magnetic planes are attached to the sites numbered by even values of @xmath5 .",
    "another range of nonzero @xmath67 is present between @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( that time the polarization is significantly stronger close to the edges than close to the symmetry axis of the nanostructure ) .",
    "the next range of nonvanishing polarization commences at the field of @xmath70 .",
    "let us comment that these results do not imply necessarily appearance of a nonzero total spin of the nanostructure .",
    "such a polarization does not take place in absence of electric field for the systems in question , what is due to the fact that the nanoflakes contain equal number of carbon atoms from both sublattices and no net spin polarization is predicted for charge neutrality conditions in such nanostructures @xcite .",
    "however , in some range of the electric fields ( for example @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , the total spin of the nanostructure equal to 1 is predicted . in order to illustrate that , we present the spin density distribution for a whole nanostructure in fig .  [ fig : fig3b ] , for three values of electric field .",
    "all three values fall within the range of appearance of nonzero spin polarization of the zigzag termination .",
    "it is visible that for the largest and the smallest value ( i.e. for @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , the total spin of the charge carriers in the nanostructure is zero , with opposite spin polarization of both edges . on the contrary , for @xmath75 , a nonzero total",
    "spin emerges .",
    "all the predicted spin polarizations manifest themselves mostly at the outermost sites of the nanostructure , mainly its zigzag terminations .    in order to gain more insight into physical mechanism leading to the polarization",
    ", we studied the energies of the discrete electronic states as a function of the electric field .",
    "in particular , we focused our attention on the lowest field range in which magnetic polarization appears in the nanostructure with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew ] , where the energies of a few occupied states close to the highest occupied one are plotted against normalized electric field . fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew](a ) corresponds to the case of charge - undoped nanoribbon , while fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew](b ) is prepared for a nanostructure doped with two additional electrons . for the system with two additional electrons",
    ", no spin polarization emerges due to external electric field and all the states are spin - degenerate ( this case is shown as a reference one ) .",
    "however , in a charge - neutral system , the situation is different . for the state with the lowest energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew](a ) , the zeeman splitting occurs in some @xmath22 range , so that spin - degeneracy is lifted .",
    "however , the picture is slightly more complex in the case of the state with higher energy ( the highest occupied state ) .",
    "namely , it lies in the vicinity of another state ( the one plotted with dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : fignew](b ) .",
    "when both states experience zeeman splitting , it becomes more energetically favourable for one of the electrons to skip to the next available state ( plotted with dashed line both in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew](b ) ) .",
    "such a situation takes place because the energy of that state for spin up becomes lower that the energy of the previous state for spin down . therefore , net polarization with spin equal to 1 occurs",
    "it can be concluded from the analysis of the fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew ] that the appearance of the spin polarization is associated with a single electronic state and requires a pair of states with small separation in energy .",
    "let us now turn the attention to the question of size of the graphene nanostructure mediating the interaction between the magnetic planes .",
    "extending the mediating graphene nanostructure would lead eventually to achieving a limit of an infinite graphene monolayer , which is actually a zero - gap semiconductor and conducts current .",
    "therefore , under such conditions , the model hamiltonian which we employ to describe the influence of the electric field on the system would no longer be physically justified . on the contrary ,",
    "the applicability of the model is limited to systems with well - separated discrete energy states ( especially with pronounced highest occupied molecular orbital - lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap ) . in particular , the spatial extension of the mediating nanostructure in the direction parallel to the electric field",
    "should be strongly limited due to screening effects .",
    "let us mention here the results of calculations in ref .",
    ", concerning the screening of the parallel electric field in graphene nanostructures of various chirality .",
    "it has been found that the screening appears the least pronounced and the potential profile across the structure is most similar to linear one in the case of an amchair nanoribbon ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) in ref .  ) . however ,",
    "increasing the width of the structure would certainly limit the validity of the model which we employ to describe the effect .",
    "another factor enforcing the usage of small graphene nanostructures is the fact that the switching of the indirect coupling is vitally dependent on the behaviour of a single energy state under the influence of the electric field , as explained before .",
    "such a state develops spin polarization and spin density associated with individual lattice sites decreases with the increase of the number of carbon atoms building the structure .",
    "therefore , the spin density at each outermost site of zigzag terminations , being in contact with magnetic plane , would be significantly limited in excessively large structures .",
    "this limitation applies to the possibility of increasing the length of the nanostructure ( i.e. the distance between magnetic planes ) . on the other hand , limitations for increasing the width of the nanostructure",
    "have been discussed in the above paragraph .",
    "these considerations are aimed at justifying the interest in the smallest graphene nanostructures in the present paper .",
    "the creation of nonuniform spin polarization at the zigzag termination of the structure under the influence of the electric field is particularly useful from the point of view of achieving electric - field control over the indirect coupling by attaching the magnetic planes to the edges .",
    "since the outermost lattice sites at both zigzag terminations belong to different sublattices ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , without electric field the indirect coupling is expected to indicate antiferromagnetic character ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of coupling results from typical indirect rkky mechanism , which consists in creation of spin polarization by one of the magnetic planes and the interaction of the other plane with such polarization .",
    "therefore , this process is describable ( for low @xmath27 exchange energies ) by means of second order perturbation calculus .",
    "however , the presence of the electric - field induced spin polarization at the lattice sites where charge carrier spins interact with magnetic moments in the attached planes opens the room for appearance of another coupling mechanism .",
    "namely , the first - order perturbative coupling mediated by spin - polarized states can become active .",
    "such a coupling mechanism has already been predicted mainly in graphene nanoflakes @xcite , but also in armchair graphene nanoribbons of finite length @xcite .",
    "therefore , the described effect of electric field on the electronic properties of the studied nanostructures potentially allow for continuous changing the indirect interaction strength and sign , which property we will show in further part of this section .",
    "let us now present the results of calculations for the complete system , including the magnetic planes .",
    "first we can follow the dependence of indirect coupling energy between the magnetic planes attached to the zigzag terminations of the sample graphene nanostructure as a function of the external electric field . the plot fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](a ) presents the predictions of calculations for three representative nanostructures , each of width @xmath53 , but with lengths equal to @xmath54 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the exchange energy is taken as @xmath78 and armchair edge deformation is included .",
    "first it is visible that for low ( or zero ) electric field the coupling is antiferromagnetic ( af ) and its magnitude decreases with the increase of the structure size .",
    "when the field increases , @xmath79 indicates first some plateau , but then becomes weaker and passes through zero , changing its sign to ferromagnetic ( f ) .",
    "this is the effect we expect on the basis of the analysis of spin polarization . for the nanostructure with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the field at which the sign change occurs coincides with the onset of spin polarization visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) .",
    "the coupling energy reaches a maximum and the drops again to antiferromagnetic values when @xmath22 increases further .",
    "a qualitatively similar behaviour of @xmath79 as a function of electric field is seen for the longer nanostructures , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , it that cases the ferromagnetic maximum is much reduced in magnitude and is shifted to weaker fields @xmath22 .",
    "what is more , the oscillatory character of changes of @xmath51 for higher fields becomes more pronounced for larger structures .",
    "finally , let us observe that for larger lengths the low - field ferromagnetic maximum tends to vanish .",
    "an analogous analysis is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) , but that time for structures sharing the same length @xmath54 and different in width : @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 . for the narrowest of the nanostructures ,",
    "the magnitudes of indirect coupling are generally reduced and for increasing @xmath22 the interaction energy slowly tends to zero , however , without visible ferromagnetic maximum .",
    "when @xmath0 increases to @xmath83 , a behaviour described in the above paragraph emerges . if @xmath85 , still a ferromagnetic maximum occurs ( like that for @xmath53 ) , but the strongest coupling is reduced and the peak is present at weaker fields .",
    "the results described above allow to state that for some sizes of the studied nanostructures , an electric field - induced , continuous switching between antiferro- and ferromagnetic indirect coupling can be achieved .",

    "the results concern the nanostructure with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "( a ) indirect coupling in linear scale ; ( b ) indirect coupling in double logarithmic scale . ]    the first - order perturbative contribution to indirect coupling can be described quantitatively by referring to the corrections to total energy of the system of charge carriers introduced by interaction with magnetic planes .",
    "this can be done in a very similar way as in ref .  .",
    "therefore , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the first - order perturbative correction to the ground state energy of the charge carriers due to their interaction with magnetic planes ( with either f or af orientation of magnetic moments ) .",
    "this correction is directly proportional to the total spin density at the appropriate sites where the contact interaction occurs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] we present the dependence of the total spin density at sites interacting with magnetic planes ( separately for both nanostructure terminations ) on exchange energy @xmath27 in the presence of electric field @xmath97 .",
    "the outermost sites are schematically marked with frames in the insets .",
    "the cases of plane magnetizations oriented ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically are considered separately , as indicated in the insets .",
    "if magnetizations of both planes are parallel , the total spin density at both nanostructure terminations takes identical values .",
    "it is visible that this value increases monotonously with @xmath27 ; the rise is very slow for low @xmath88 and for @xmath111 the slope increases and @xmath112 .",
    "the situation is somehow different when magnetizations of both planes are antiparallel . in such circumstances the total spins at both terminations are different . for @xmath105 , at one termination the spin rises with @xmath27 , while at the other one it decreases , while both spins keep parallel orientation .",
    "however , at @xmath113 the spins become antiparallel and their absolute values become identical ( a kind of metamagnetic transition takes place ) . therefore , the total spin density at outermost atoms of both zigzag terminations is equal to 0 .",
    "it can be concluded that for @xmath105 the spin density is only weakly influenced by exchange interaction with magnetic planes . on the other hand , for @xmath114 , the leading contribution to indirect coupling originates only from the ferromagnetic state of magnetization of both planes .",
    "therefore , since spin density approximately increases according to @xmath112 , also @xmath51 follows this proportionality .",
    "let us state that this is no longer a first - order contribution to indirect coupling , since the spin density is modified by exchange interaction between planar magnetic moments and spins of charge carriers and such a modified value enters the formula for indirect exchange .",
    "the second one of the mentioned ranges seems to contain the most important values of @xmath27 for practical uses .",
    "total spin density at outermost sites of zigzag terminations of the nanostructure with @xmath53 and @xmath54 as a function of exchange energy @xmath27 , for ferromagnetic ( solid line ) and antiferromagnetic ( dashed and dotted lines ) orientation of magnetic moments in both planes attached to the nanostructure .",
    "electric field of @xmath97 is present . ]    in order to identify the crucial factors shaping the response of the indirect coupling to the electric field , let us supplement the previous results with those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] . in that plot ,",
    "@xmath51 is shown as a function of normalized electric field for the representative and most interesting nanostructure with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "different lines correspond to the results in which armchair edge deformation ( parametrized by @xmath115 ) and coulombic interactions ( parametrized by hubbard @xmath20 parameter ) are separately included or excluded .",
    "first it is noticeable that the weakest antiferromagnetic indirect exchange at zero electric field occurs for the absence of coulombic interactions and edge deformation .",
    "emergence of the edge bonds shortening for @xmath116 is only weakly reflected in @xmath51 , while switching on @xmath20 results in considerable strengthening of indirect coupling .",
    "for the range of electric fields for which switching to ferromagnetic interaction happens , the similar situation can be seen .",
    "namely , the most crucial factor influencing the coupling is coulombic interaction ( positive @xmath20 value ) , while @xmath115 has only slight effect on @xmath51 .",
    "if the electric field becomes stronger , the important influence of edge deformation can be noticed mainly in presence of @xmath117 for the deep antiferromagnetic minimum .",
    "it can be generally concluded that the presence of coulombic interaction tends to boost the magnitude of indirect coupling , conserving its sign .",
    "this factor also extends significantly the range of ferromagnetic interaction peak present at @xmath118 , shifting the field for which sign changes back to antiferromagnetic one towards higher values .",
    "therefore , coulombic interactions promote the features which are desirable from the point of view of obtaining a clearly field - controlled indirect coupling .",
    "let us also observe that the electric field switching of @xmath51 between antiferro- and ferromagnetic values is observable for every choice of parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , what allows to state that this feature is considerably robust .    indirect coupling between the planes as a function of normalized external electric field for a nanostructure with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in presence and in absence of coulombic interactions ( parametrized by hubbard parameter @xmath20 ) and armchair edge deformation of the nanostructure .",
    "in our study we have demonstrated the prediction of indirect coupling between magnetic planes mediated by charge carriers in a graphene nanostructure of particular size and geometry .",
    "the crucial characteristic of this interaction is its sensitivity to external electric field in plane of the nanostructure .",
    "namely , the coupling which is antiferromagnetic below certain critical electric field can be continuously switched to ferromagnetic sign for field strong enough .",
    "further increase of the field brings the coupling back to antiferromagnetic regime .",
    "the effect is present for a wide range of exchange energies between attached magnetic planes and spins of the charge carriers .",
    "moreover , it is also robust against deformation of the armchair edge of the mediating nanostructure and boosted by coulombic interactions .",
    "the origin of the effect is connected with field - induced appearance of the nonzero spin density distributed along the zigzag termination , not necessarily connected with net magnetic polarization of the structure as a whole .",
    "the extreme values of ferro- and antiferromagnetic indirect interaction are found to be of comparable magnitude .",
    "let us emphasize that the nanostructures mediating the interaction ( in the form considered in the present study ) appear experimentally accessible and their magnetic properties can be examined @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is also a constant progress in achieving well - controllable graphene nanoribbons , including the development of bottom - up methods utilizing molecular precursors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this encourages studies of geometrically well - defined graphene structures , focusing on their usefulness in spintronics .",
    "moreover , in presence of magnetic planes attached to the zigzag edges of the nanostructure , the conditions for emergence of zigzag edge spin polarization should be more favourable than those in free - standing graphene , since the magnetic planes serve as a source of exchange field and magnetic anisotropy stabilizing the ordering against thermal excitations .",
    "this factor , together with recent results concerning zigzag edge magnetism @xcite , supports interest in such systems",
    ".    the described effect can find application in construction of electric - field controlled spintronic devices based on graphene .",
    "the further developments may include search for analogous field - tunable effects among structures of various geometry as well as , for example , study of simultaneous effect of electric and magnetic field on the described phenomenon .",
    "moreover , the effect of charge doping might be worthy of investigations .",
    "however , let us mention that the properties of the smallest mediating nanostructures appear the most promising , since the increase in size causes inevitably the screening effects to reduce the influence of external electric field on the desirable properties @xcite .",
    "let us also comment that for the purpose of increasing the energy of indirect coupling between the magnetic planes , the device would be imagined with numerous identical mediating nanostructures attached to the planes .",
    "these structures would be placed at equal distance one from another , possibly each structure accompanied with its own pair of electric gates .",
    "in such a way the coupling would be enhanced .",
