    "finally we mention the reason why we should take @xmath57 instead of @xmath2 in our formulae for the numbers of the zero modes .",
    "let us consider a d - string of @xmath5 theory in fig .",

    "the zero mode equations take the same form as eqs .",

    "( [ zero2 ] ) is simply @xmath119 .",
    "the others possess @xmath120 zero - modes because the d - string is regarded as two fundamental monopoles in eqs .",
    "( [ zero1 ] ) and ( [ gauge2 ] ) .",
    "this is incorrect because we know from the beginning , there are only four moduli degrees of freedom around this configuration .",
    "this failure of the zero modes analysis may be understood as follows . around the d - string configuration , the field - theoretic potential is too flat to capture the correct number of zero modes by just considering the linearized fluctuations of eqs .",
    "( [ zero1 ] ) , ( [ zero2 ] ) and ( [ gauge2 ] ) . the higher order analysis will show that the the relative motions of the two fundamental monopoles drops out of the moduli space , which leaves just four overall translation degrees .    however , our formula , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : totbzm ] ) and ( [ eq : totalferzero ] ) , for the zero modes are still valid for the d - string because we are using the minimal embedding of solutions and , hence , @xmath121 .",
    "our result of the number of the bosonic zero modes does not agree with that from the iib string theory . to illustrate ,",
    "let us consider the simplest case of a tree three - pronged string with two - form charges ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) and @xmath122 .",
    "the magnetic charge of the corresponding field theory solution in @xmath5 is @xmath123 .",
    "thus the magnetic part has two fundamental monopoles , and the result ( [ eq : totbzm ] ) tells that there are seven bosonic zero modes .",
    "this number looks quite odd , and moreover this does not agree with the iib result that is just three for the present case@xcite .",
    "however this is a very natural result from the explicit junction solution discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "their solution is composed of two monopole cores which are surrounded by clouds of w - bosons , i.e. electric charges .",
    "the monopole part has eight bosonic zero modes which are composed of the zero modes associated to three translations , two gauge , two relative orientations , and one relative distance .",
    "the electric part is determined by the monopole part when the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields take given fixed values .",
    "especially , the electric charges of the junction solution are determined by the relative distance , while the magnetic charges are just topological numbers and stable . since the electric charges appear in the asymptotic @xmath124 behavior of the junction solution , the change of the relative distance is not normalizable .",
    "thus we should keep the relative distance fixed .",
    "the other monopole zero modes are naturally expected to be normalizable , and hence there are seven bosonic zero modes in the junction solution .    on the other hand",
    ", we find a nice agreement for the fermionic part .",
    "let us consider a monopole configuration with magnetic charges @xmath125 .",
    "the corresponding string configuration is such that @xmath126 d3-branes are aligned on a line and that the @xmath127-th and the @xmath128-th d3-brane are connected by @xmath49 d - strings @xmath129 .",
    "this configuration may be regarded as the string configuration corresponding to a junction solution in the limit of vanishing electric charges . to recover from the limit ,",
    "let us now add small ns - ns charges on each string .",
    "we do not take care of the quantization of the ns - ns charges , since our treatment in the field theory is just classical and does not care about the quantization of the electric charges .",
    "then the configuration of the string is deformed , for example , to the one in fig.[fig : stringcon ] , where there are @xmath130 internal loops between the @xmath127-th and @xmath128-th d3-branes . although the diagram changes if the assignment of the small ns - ns charges is changed , the number of loops do not change .",

    "the result is @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the number of internal loops ( faces ) of the string diagram and @xmath134 is the number of the external strings .",
    "thus , applying to the present case , we obtain @xmath135 which agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : totalferzero ] ) .    finally , the discrepancy of the bosonic zero modes from the iib string picture might be understood as follows .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : totbzm ] ) of the bosonic zero modes can be written as @xmath136 where the last term is the iib result@xcite , @xmath137 it is intriguing to note that the discrepancy ( [ disc ] ) agrees with the number of the compact directions of the monopole moduli space , i.e. there are @xmath138 relative spatial orientations among the fundamental monopoles and one @xmath139 gauge direction per each fundamental monopole .",
    "it might be expected that , when the junction bps state is treated quantum mechanically , the wave function prevails the compact directions and these directions do not appear as the moduli of the state .",
    "in this paper , we nonperturbatively identified the numbers of the bosonic and fermionic zero modes of the multi - pronged strings in the context of the @xmath0 super - yang - mills theory .",
    "the bosonic zero modes differ from the iib string picture , but the fermionic zero modes are matching with those in the iib string picture .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the softness of the field - theoretic configurations .",
    "namely the monopoles of the multi - pronged strings in the field theory can take a relative motion in the parallel space of the d3-branes , whereas the corresponding degrees in the iib picture can not be permitted . in the case of the minimal three - pronged strings , the number of bosonic zero modes are seven while there are twelve fermionic zero modes . on the ground of the remaining supersymmetries of the system",

    "thus , recalling the fact that there are @xmath160 degrees of freedom of the electric charges and from eq .",
    "( [ zero2 ] ) , the equation ( [ eq : connor ] ) is equivalent to the condition that the electric charges do not change under the infinitesimally small changes of the monopole moduli . since the electric charges appear in the asymptotic @xmath124 behavior of @xmath68 , this is a necessary condition for the infinitesimal change to be normalizable under the measure @xmath161 .",
    "this necessary condition becomes a sufficient condition if the order next to @xmath124 is @xmath162 as in the expansion ( [ eq : infexplam1 ] ) and ( [ eq : infexplam ] ) . in the spherically symmetric solution discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the next order is exponentially damping .",
    "in general non - spherical cases@xcite , the next order is expected to behave as @xmath162 from dipole contributions .",
    "there is another way to see the condition ( [ eq : connor ] ) .",
    "since the operator @xmath163 is a semi positive definite hermitian operator , one may expand @xmath68 in terms of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the equation ( [ zero2 ] ) is now @xmath164 ) = 0 , \\label{eq : expinfgauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 denotes the eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath166 with @xmath167 parameterizing the degeneracies of the eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue , and @xmath68 is expanded as @xmath168 . if the second term of eq.([eq : expinfgauss ] ) is non - zero at @xmath169 , the @xmath170 will behave in @xmath171 near @xmath169 ( we assume that the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath163 exist continuously around @xmath169 ) .",
    "this behavior may violate the normalizability .",
    "therefore the condition that the second term vanishes for @xmath172 is related to the normalizability .",
    "this is the condition ( [ eq : connor ] ) . but",
    "to conclude this we need the measure near @xmath169 from more knowledge on the spectrum of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors .",
