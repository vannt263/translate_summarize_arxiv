    "the search for habitable earth - like planets is a major contemporary goal of astronomy . as the detection of exoplanets is biased towards systems with small differences in mass , radius and luminosity between star and planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m - type main sequence stars have become prime targets in the search of earth - like planets in the habitable zone .",
    "m dwarfs evolve slowly : their planets might remain within a continuously habitable zone ( chz ) , i.e. harbouring surface liquid water , for several gyr , providing ample time for the advent of life on a rocky planet .    with an effective temperature ( ) @xmath36000k , cool white dwarfs ( cwd )",
    "are also promising hosts of rocky planets in the habitable zone .",
    "white dwarfs initially cool down rapidly , with temperature decreasing by thousands of degrees in @xmath03gyr @xcite . at @xmath06000k",
    ", crystallisation slows the cooling process .",
    "this produces a habitable zone which endures for up to 8gyr @xcite , well in excess of the time required for life to arise on earth .",
    "white dwarfs provide a stable luminosity source without the potentially damaging radiation produced by stellar activity in m dwarfs .",
    "a planet orbiting close to a white dwarf would synchronize within 1000yr and would have a stable orbit , as the planet would not raise tides on the star @xcite .",
    "the major issue for the presence of a planet close to a white dwarf is survival during the host star s giant phase .",
    "@xcite review several mechanisms which would result in a planet orbiting a white dwarf .",
    "@xcite found two earth - sized bodies in a very close orbit ( @xmath00.007au ) around a post - red - giant star proving that planet - sized objects can survive the post - main sequence evolution phases of their host star .",
    "further evidence for the existence of rocky bodies close to white dwarfs comes from the presence of metallic lines ( e.g. mg and fe ) in the spectra of dz white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "heavy metals in the atmospheres of these stars can only be explained by atmospheric  pollution \" caused by the accretion of terrestrial - like planets or planetesimals ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the low luminosity of cwds creates a habitable zone at only @xmath00.01au , ten times closer than for m dwarfs .",
    "this facilitates the detection of small bodies orbiting white dwarfs : @xcite showed that transits of mars - sized planets in the white dwarf chz would be 1% deep , easily detectable with present - day ground - based facilities , even for rather faint stars , though searches for planetary companions to white dwarfs have so far been unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "polarimetric techniques can also be used to discover and characterize exoplanets . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , as a planet orbits around the host star ,",
    "the amount of polarisation varies regularly , showing maxima when the planet is near quadrature .",
    "the amplitude of the variation depends mainly on the orbital inclination , @xmath4 , with no polarimetric variability for a face - on orbit .",
    "the detection and measurement of regular polarisation variations permit discovery of exoplanets , with an efficiency dependent on @xmath4 , similar to that of the radial velocity planet detections .",
    "spectropolarimetry of planet - hosting stars could characterise the atmosphere of an exoplanet @xcite , something now only possible for transiting exoplanets .",
    "it is important to establish whether cwd have a flux distribution which would allow the advent of complex life on earth - like planets orbiting in the chz . consider an earth - like planet with surface liquid water and a nitrogen - dominated atmosphere , orbiting in the white dwarf chz .",
    "major requirements for the persistence of life , as we know it on earth , are sufficient suitable radiation to sustain photosynthesis and a uv flux low enough to prevent fatal dna damage .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxes ] shows a comparison between the synthetic surface fluxes of cwds with pure hydrogen atmospheres at four different , the sun ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a 5777k black body .",

    "the hydrogen lines weaken untill they almost disappear .",
    "thin continuous red line : synthetic fluxes of the sun calculated with marcs models ; dotted line : a 5777k , black body , i.e. with the sun s .",
    "the vertical black line at 3100  shows the limit for the dna damaging fluxes .",
    "the shaded areas show the wavelengths playing a major role in the process of photosynthesis.,width=604 ]    the wavelength ranges playing a role in the photosynthetic processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are bluewards of 5000  and between 6000 and 7000 .",
    "the fluxes integrated over these wavelengths for a 5800k white dwarf and the sun are almost identical .",
    "this direct comparison is valid because the angular diameter of a cwd , as seen from the chz , is similar to that of the sun , as seen from earth @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that photosynthesis can occur on exoplanets in the habitable zone of m dwarfs .",
    "the photosynthetic relevant flux intercepted by a planet in the chz of a 4000k white dwarf is larger than that intercepted by the same planet in the habitable zone of a typical m - dwarf .",
    "these comparisons show that photosynthesis would be both feasible and efficient on planets orbiting in the white dwarf chz .",
    "fluxes shortwards of @xmath03100   ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fluxes ] ) can potentially damage dna molecules . to check whether the uv radiation emitted by a cwd is a threat to the formation and persistence of dna molecules , we compared the dna dose expected for an earth - like planet in the white dwarf chz with that experienced on earth .",
    "we adapted a radiative transfer model developed for application to mars @xcite to create a simplified earth - atmosphere model and determine the amount of uv radiation received at the planet s surface as a function of white dwarf temperature . to provide an effective comparison as a function of stellar temperature , we modelled the same conditions for a hypothetical earth - like planet around a main sequence star , with the semi - major axis varied as a function of temperature , keeping the",
    " main sequence exoplanet \" within the habitable zone .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dna - dose ] .",
    "we used a standard terrestrial atmospheric composition , with a nominal ozone abundance of 300du .",
    "this is a first - order approximation as we neglect important factors such as clouds . to interpret the surface irradiances in a biological context",
    ", we applied a dna action spectrum @xcite to the modelled spectra to define a dna - weighted dose for each case .",
    "dna is used here as a generic model of the response of carbon - based organisms to uv .",
    "dna - weighted dose for an earth - like planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a cwd ( black continuous line ) and of main sequence stars ( dashed red line ) . in the white dwarf case we adopted an orbital separation of 0.01au , while in the main sequence case we adopted a varying orbital separation to maintain constant the planet equilibrium temperature .",
    "the dna - weighted dose is normalised to that of present earth .",
    "the upper x - axis indicates the white dwarf age , at a given temperature.,width=604 ]    the dna - weighted uv dose encountered at the surface of an earth - like planet in the white dwarf chz becomes comparable to that of an exoplanet in the habitable zone of a main sequence star at approximately 5000k .",
    "interestingly , present - day solar conditions produce an average dose on earth a factor of only 1.65 less than that for a white dwarf with solar .",
    "varying terrestrial atmospheric conditions at times produce dna - weighted doses on earth as high as that on a cwd planet .",
    "figure  [ fig : dna - dose ] also clearly demonstrates that the dna - weighted dose for a hypothetical earth - like planet around a cwd is remarkably benign from an astrobiological perspective , for an extremely long period of time .",
    "we therefore conclude that a cwd is a plausible source of energy for the advent and persistence of complex life , as we know it on earth .",
    "we have to point out that about 10% of all white dwarfs host magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a planet in the chz of a magnetic white dwarf would constantly orbit inside the star s magnetic field , which , at 0.01au can be as large as a few kg .",
    "such a field , interacting with biological matter , might prevent the persistence of life .",
    "this issue is the subject of a forthcoming study and for now we assume the potential planet - hosting white dwarf to be non- ( or weakly ) magnetic .",
    "this assumption also implies the absence of magnetic drag , which would cause the planet orbit to decay .    in the previous analysis , we also assumed an atmosphere - bearing planet , although the initial high temperature of the white dwarf would cause the atmosphere of a close - in planet to evaporate .",
    "various mechanisms , such as planet migration and crustal outgassing , could however replenish an atmosphere .",
    "using white dwarf model fluxes from sect .  [ sec : life ] and models of reflected light and degree of polarisation from @xcite , we calculated the amount of polarised light reflected by the atmosphere of an unresolved earth - sized planet in the chz of cwds . throughout",
    "we adopt a phase angle @xmath5 ( angle between star and earth as seen from the planet ) and a cloudfree lambertian planet surface with a wavelength independent albedo of 1.0 .",
    "this is an idealised case : for comparison the earth s albedo is @xmath6 @xcite , though a snowball earth might have an albedo of @xmath7 .",
    "assuming an orbit inclination angle of 90@xmath8 , the polarisation as a function of wavelength ( @xmath9 ) and phase angle , @xmath10 , seen by a distant observer is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , varying between 0 and 1.2 , are two elements of the planet scattering matrix ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the planet radius and orbital separation , and @xmath16 is the stellar flux .",
    "the numerator represents the polarised flux reflected by the planet , while the denominator corresponds to the total flux emitted by the system ( @xmath17 as @xmath18 ) .    following @xcite",
    ", @xmath13 is maximum at @xmath5 , therefore the maximum polarisation becomes : @xmath19    figure  [ fig : polarisation ] shows the maximum polarisation , as a function of wavelength , produced by an unresolved earth - sized planet orbiting at a distance of 0.01au from a 5000k white dwarf .",
    "we examined the dependence of the polarisation on orbital separation and planet radius , taking the polarisation at 4000 .",
    "the results are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : polarisation ] .",
    "table  [ tab : pol - values ] gives the polarisation at three different wavelengths , produced by mars - sized , earth - sized and super - earth - size planets orbiting around a 5000k white dwarf .",
    "three different distances from the host star were used : 0.0054 , 0.01 , and 0.02au , representative of the inner edge , centre and outer edge of the white dwarf chz , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : pol - values ] also gives the polarisation of unresolved earth - sized planets orbiting in the habitable zone of a sun - like star and of a typical m dwarf ( = 3200k ) .",
    "table  [ tab : pol - values ] shows that the polarisation produced by an unresolved earth - sized planet at 1au from a sun - like star is the order of 10@xmath20 . for a typical m dwarf",
