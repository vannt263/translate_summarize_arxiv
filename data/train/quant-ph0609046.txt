    "the no - cloning theorem @xcite states that one can not produce a number of independent physical systems prepared in identical states out of a smaller amount of systems prepared in the same state .",
    "this fact challenged the scientific community to find transformations which can approximate the cloning transformation with the highest possible fidelity .",
    "a whole branch in the literature is devoted to this problem , and optimal cloners have been found , for qubits @xcite , for general finite - dimensional systems @xcite , for restricted sets of input states @xcite , and for infinite - dimensional systems such as harmonic oscillators  the so called continuous variables cloners @xcite . in all these cases pure states have been considered . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of cloning mixed states is somehow more interesting , since a more general type of cloning transformation can be considered  the so - called _",
    "broadcasting_in which the output copies are in a globally correlated state whose local `` reduced '' states are identical to the input states . this possibility has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that broadcasting a single copy from a noncommuting set of density matrices is always impossible .",
    "the no broadcasting theorem was the only interesting result for mixed states for many years , and this led to the belief that a generalization of the no - cloning theorem to mixed states should hold .",
    "however , more recently , for qubits an effect called _ superbroadcasting _",
    "@xcite has been discovered , which consists in the possibility of broadcasting the state while even increasing the purity of the local state , for at least @xmath2 input copies , and for sufficiently short input bloch vector ( and even for @xmath3 input copies for phase - covariant broadcasting instead of universal covariance @xcite ) , and these superbroadcasting maps can be mixed with depolarizing maps in order to get exact broadcasting .    in the present paper",
    ", we analyze the broadcasting of mixed states of an harmonic oscillator by a signal - preserving map .",
    "more precisely , this means that we consider a set of input states obtained by displacing a fixed mixed state by a complex amplitude in the harmonic oscillator phase space , while the broadcasting map is covariant with respect to the ( weyl - heisenberg ) group of complex displacements .",
    "we will focus first on displaced thermal states ( which are equivalent to coherent states that have suffered gaussian noise ) , and then we will show that all results hold for any covariant set of mixed states in terms of noise of conjugated quadratures .",
    "as we will see , superbroadcasting is possible for harmonic oscillator mixed states @xcite , namely one can produce a larger number of copies , which are locally purified on each output oscillator , and with the same signal as the input . for displaced thermal states , for example , superbroadcasting can be achieved for at least @xmath4 input copies , with thermal photon number @xmath5 , whereas , for sufficiently large @xmath6 at the input , one can broadcast to an unbounded number @xmath7 of output copies . for purification ( i.e. @xmath8 ) , quite surprisingly the purification rate is @xmath9 , independently on @xmath7 .",
    "the particular case of 2 to 1 for noisy coherent states has been reported in ref .",
    ". we will prove also that perfect broadcasting is possible , provided that one knows the input thermal photon number .",
    "we consider the problem of broadcasting @xmath0 input copies of displaced ( generally ) mixed states of harmonic oscillators ( with annihilation operators denoted by @xmath10 ) to @xmath7 output copies ( with annihilation operators @xmath11 ) . in order to preserve the signal ,",

    "is written as @xmath125 on the other hand , one has @xmath126 eqs .",
    "( [ ass ] ) and ( [ ass2 ] ) together give the bound for the minimal noise @xmath127 @xmath128 the example in the previous sections corresponds to @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "hence , in principle , these bounds might be violated by more exotic and nonlinear transformations .",
    "therefore , the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ bnd ] ) is stronger , since it has general validity .    by a similar derivation , using the bound for phase - conjugated amplifiers @xmath135 , one can obtain the bound for phase - conjugation broadcasting @xmath136",
    "the optimal broadcasting can be easily implemented on radiation modes , by means of an inverse @xmath0-splitter which concentrates the signal in one mode and discards the other @xmath137 modes .",
    "the mode is then amplified by a phase - insensitive amplifier with power gain @xmath138 .",
    "finally , the amplified mode is distributed by mixing it in an @xmath7-splitter with @xmath139 vacuum modes .",
    "each mode is then found in the state of eq .",
    "( [ rhogen ] ) . in the concentration stage",
    "the @xmath0 modes with amplitude @xmath140 and noise @xmath141 are reduced to a single mode with amplitude @xmath142 and noise @xmath143 .",
    "the amplification stage gives a mode with amplitude @xmath144 and noise @xmath145 .",

    "the output is given by the bipartite state @xmath152 @xmath153 where we performed the change of variables @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "now , the reflected mode is measured by heterodyne detection , and conditionally on the measurement outcome @xmath156 , a displacement @xmath157 is performed on the transmitted mode , whose state is then given by @xmath158}d(\\gamma).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the action of a phase - insensitive amplifier on @xmath81 can be easily calculated and produces the partial output state @xmath159 the following conditions @xmath160 which equivalent to @xmath161 imply that @xmath162.hence , by tuning the beam splitter transmissivity and the parameter of the conditional displacement @xmath100 , one can then simulate the amplifier by a linear device assisted by heterodyne and feed - forward .",
    "in conclusion , we proved that broadcasting of @xmath7 copies of a mixed radiation state starting from @xmath163 copies is possible , even with lowering the total noise in conjugate quadratures .",
    "since the noise can not be removed without violating the quantum data processing theorem , the price to pay for having higher purity at the output is that the output copies are correlated .",
    "essentially noise is moved from local states to their correlations , and our superbroadcasting channel does this optimally .",
    "we obtained similar results also for purification ( i.e. @xmath164 ) , along with the case of simultaneous broadcasting and phase - conjugation , with the output copies carrying a signal which is complex - conjugated of the input one . despite the role that correlations play in this effect ,",
    "no entanglement is present in the output ( as long as the single input copy has a positive @xmath165-function ) , as it can be seen by the analytical expression of the output states .",
    "moreover , a practical and very simple scheme for experimental achievement of the maps has been shown , involving mainly passive media and only one parametric amplifier .",
    "the superbroadcasting effect has a relevance form the fundamental point of view , opening new perspectives in the understanding of correlations and their interplay with noise , but may be also promising from a practical point of view , for communication tasks in the presence of noise .",
