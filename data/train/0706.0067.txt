    "these simplifications are due to homogeneity which implies continuous translational symmetry and isotropy which implies continuous rotational symmetry .",
    "such simplifications do not generally occur in ordered phases .",
    "the pair correlation functions as a function of intermolecular separations and orientations at a given temperature and pressure can be found either by computer simulation[1 - 5 ] or by simultaneous solution of an integral equation , the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation ,    h(*x*_1,*x*_2)=c(*x*_1 , * x*_2)+c(*x*_1 , * x*_3)(*x*_3)h(*x*_3 , * x*_2 ) d*x*_3 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 are respectively , the total and direct pair correlation functions , and an algebraic closure relation which relates the correlation functions to the pair potential . well known approximations to the closure relation are the hypernetted - chain relation , the percus - yevick ( py ) relation and the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) [ 6 ] .",
    "these integral equation theories have been quite successful in describing the structure and thermodynamic properties of isotropic fluids [ 7 - 11 ] .",
    "however , their application to ordered phases which can be regarded as inhomogeneous , have so far been very limited [ 12 - 15 ] , though no feature of the theory inherently prevents them from being used to describe the structure of ordered phases .",
    "one of the problems that arises in the case of ordered phases is the appearance of @xmath27 in the oz equation ( see eq.(1.5 ) ) .",
    "this implies that in contrast to the isotropic case where we needed only two relations , namely the oz equation and a closure relation , an additional relation corresponding to single particle distribution connecting to pair correlation function is needed to solve the ensuing equations self consistently .",
    "in this paper we take nematic in which molecules are aligned on the average along a particular but arbitrary direction while the translational degrees of freedom remain disordered as in an isotropic phase , as an example of an ordered phase . at the isotropic - nematic transition the isotropy of the space",
    "is spontaneously broken and as a consequence , the correlations in the distribution of molecules lose their rotational invariance .",
    "the change from isotropic fluid to nematic state in the absence of external field involves collective fluctuations , which develops orientational wave excitations known as goldstone modes[16 ] .",
    "this leads to the divergence of the corresponding harmonics of the total pair correlation function @xmath28 in the limit of zero wave vector . by computer simulation of a system of ellipsoids phoung and schmid",
    "[ 13 ] have evaluated the effect of breaking of rotational symmetry on pair correlation functions and showed that in a nematic phase there are two qualitatively different contributions ; one that preserves rotational invariance and the other that breaks it and vanishes in the isotropic phase .",
    "holovko and sokolovska [ 14 ] have used the msa closure relation and the lovett equation [ 17 ] ( see eq.(3.17))which relates one particle density to pair correlation function to solve analytically the oz equation for a model of spherical particles with the long range anisotropic interaction ( see eq.(2.1 ) ) in a nematic phase . however , when phoung and schmid [ 13 ] used the py closure and the lovett equation and solved the oz equation numerically for a system of soft ellipsoids , nematic phase was not found and for this the py closure was blamed .",
    "zhong and petschek [ 18 ] have analyzed the diagrammatic expansion of the direct correlation function and concluded that the py closure can not reproduce the goldstone modes in the general case of spontaneous partial ordering .",
    "recently we [ 19 ] used the py closure and solved numerically the oz equation for a system of elongated rigid molecules interacting via the gay - berne potential [ 20 ] and showed that the py closure gives nematic phase with the pair correlation function harmonic coefficients having features similar to those found by computer simulation [ 13 ] and by analytical solution [ 14 ] .",
    "instead of using a closure relation for @xmath29 we expressed it in terms of order parameters and solved the resulting equation for values of order parameters ranging from zero to some maximum value .",
    "non - zero values of order parameters break the symmetry of isotropic phase and the degree of symmetry breaking is given by the values of the order parameters . using these correlation functions we constructed a free energy functional and used it to determine the value of order parameters in the nematic phase by minimizing it .",
    "once the values of order parameters are known the pair correlation functions in the nematic phase are obtained from the known results .    in this paper we extend our method to calculate the pair correlation functions in nematic phase using the msa and py closure relations for a system the molecules of which interact via a pair potential considered in ref .",
    "this allows us to compare our results for the msa with those found analytically and therefore to test the accuracy of our method .",
    "the py relation is shown to give nematic phase with all the expected features .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we describe the msa and py integral equation theories and give a brief account of computational procedure . in sec .",
    "iii we construct a free energy functional of an inhomogeneous system that contains both symmetry conserved and symmetry broken parts of the direct pair correlation function .",
    "the isotropic - nematic transition point and freezing parameters are calculated in sec iv .",
    "the paper ends with discussions given in sec .",
    "the pair potential used by holovko and sokolovska [ 14 ] in their analytical solution of the oz and lovett equation with msa closure has the form v(*x*_1,*x*_2)= v_hs(r)+v_0(r)+v_2(r , _ 1 , _ 2 ) where @xmath30 is the hard sphere potential .",
