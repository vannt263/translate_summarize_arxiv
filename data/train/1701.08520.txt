    "@xmath2-wave pairing of fermions is a basis of superfluidity in @xmath3he  @xcite , and it provides superconductivity in unconventional superconductors  @xcite .",
    "presently , the @xmath0-wave superfluid pairing attracts a great deal of interest in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons is the search for topological @xmath1 superfluid of identical fermions in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry.topological properties of this phase emerge from zero - energy majorana modes on the vortex cores  @xcite , and non - abelian statistics of the vortices forms a basis for the implementation of topologically protected quantum information processing  @xcite .    despite a significant progress in theory  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 superfluid has not been observed . the crucial obstacle to achieve this phase for spinless short - range interacting fermions comes from a small value of the @xmath0-wave interaction .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a sizable transition temperature one has to approach a @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance .",
    "the @xmath0-wave resonances have been studied in experiments with fermionic potassium  @xcite and lithium  @xcite atoms .",

    "the situation is different .",
    "the effect of the lattice potential on the formation of a superfluid phase of atomic fermions has been actively discussed @xcite . in particular , for the @xmath4-wave pairing of spin-1/2 fermions an increase in the depth of the optical potential results in a stronger atom localization and hence in increasing the on - site interaction . at the same time , the tunneling becomes weaker .",
    "the combined effect of these two factors is a strong increase in the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "this has been observed in the mit experiment @xcite . for the lattice filling somewhat smaller than unity",
    ", the physical picture can be rephrased as follows .",
    "an increase in the lattice depth increases an effective mass of atoms and , hence , makes the density of states ( dos ) larger .",
    "the effective fermion - fermion scattering amplitude is also increasing .",
    "the critical temperature in the bcs approach is @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is proportional to the product of the ( modulus of ) the scattering amplitude and the dos on the fermi surface .",
    "thus , an increase in the lattice potential increases @xmath7 .    on the contrary , for identical fermions in fairly deep lattices ( tight - binding model )",
    "the fermion - fermion scattering amplitude is strongly reduced . in the lowest band approach",
    "two fermions do not occupy the same lattice site , and the amplitude is proportional to a very small overlap of the wavefunctions of fermions sitting in the neighboring sites .",
    "this suppresses the @xmath0-wave superfluid pairing for fairly small filling factors in deep lattices , which is consistent with numerical calculations of ref .",

    "the kronig - penney potential is used in cold atom theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) to mimic sinusoidal potentials of common optical lattices . in particular",
    ", this model allows us to investigate two important questions .",
    "the first one is about an interplay between an increase of the dos and the modification of the fermion - fermion interaction in lattices of moderate depths .",
    "we demonstrate that the reduction of the scattering amplitude still dominates over the enhance of the dos .",
    "the second question is about the stability of the system with respect to collisional losses .",
    "we show that the lattice setup reduces inelastic collisional losses compared to free space , and one can approach the feshbach resonance without a strong collisional instability .",
    "this opens a possibility to observe the lattice @xmath1 2d superfluid and maybe other interesting many - body phases .",
