    "we apply the following procedure to the spectral range between 2.925 and 2.935@xmath0 m , where the s / n is higher , the spectrum is less affected by detector or telluric gaps , and the h@xmath14o and oh lines are more isolated and stronger ( figure [ fig : phot stand ] ) .",

    "by combining h@xmath14o and oh spectra between 2.9 and 35@xmath0 m , we find a wavelength dependence in the decrease of line fluxes .",

    "the decrease of water emission is found as a sequential intrinsic decrease of the observed line fluxes and of the line - to - continuum strength , where water line fluxes at short wavelengths decrease when water line fluxes at longer wavelengths are still strong . since the emission probes hotter to colder gas from short to long wavelengths ( following a global trend in @xmath64 energies that decrease with increasing wavelength ",

    "this procedure proves to be effective in correcting most science spectra , those that match well with a spectral template and where the disk gas emission lines are broader than the absorption lines from the same molecules in the stellar photosphere . in some cases ,",
    "however , there is no unambiguous / acceptable spectral match with a template ( in cwtau , htlup , and imlup ) , or the disk emission lines are possibly as narrow as the photospheric lines ( in fntau and twhya ) ; in these cases , the residuals after photospheric correction leave larger uncertainties on potential detections of h@xmath14o and oh and on their line profiles .                                          figures [ fig : mol eq bc ] , [ fig : mol spca ] , [ fig : mol unclear ] , [ fig : mol eq co1 - 0 ] , [ fig : mol unclear1 ] , and [ fig : no h2o oh ] show fits to crires 2.9@xmath0 m spectra made by using the co line profiles as models for h@xmath14o and oh emission , as explained in section [ sec : ana4 ] .",
    "in addition to fitting the 2.9@xmath0 m data with the nc or bc separately ( in those disks that have two co components ) , we also combine nc and bc profiles in different fractions , a technique that we call spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) as being based on principal spectral components given by nc and bc ( figure [ fig : mol spca ] ) . in the double - component disks , we can therefore test whether h@xmath14o and oh are composed of one rather than two components , and which one dominates . to determine which model best represents the data between nc , bc , and their combination , we use the akaike information criterion @xcite , defined as aic = @xmath136 the number of free model parameters + the chisquare value .",
    "the criterion penalizes models with a larger number of free parameters , so that a simpler model is preferred unless the more complex model decreases the aic number significantly ( we adopt the criterion of a @xmath137aic @xmath138 , corresponding to a @xmath139 higher probability of minimizing the information loss ) . in most cases ,",
    "the chisquare value is enough to identify the best model between bc and nc .",
    "this procedure is generally robust against the photospheric correction performed on the 2.9@xmath0 m velocity - resolved spectra obtained by crires ( section [ sec : ana3 ] ) , because the disk emission lines are typically broader than photospheric lines from the same molecules ( figures [ fig : phot stand ] , [ fig : mol comp ] , [ fig : phot_corr_1 ] , [ fig : phot_corr_2 ] ) , and because the high resolving power of crires allows to separate emission components with different velocities . in two disks ( fntau , twhya )",
    ", however , photospheric lines have similar width as the possibly detected oh emission lines , while h@xmath14o is undetected ; their oh line fluxes and profiles are therefore highly uncertain ( see figure [ fig : mol unclear1 ] ) .",
    "overall , both non - detections and detections of weak emission advocate for the predominance of bc over nc in h@xmath14o and oh emission at 2.9@xmath0 m . in a few cases ,",
    "spectra are best fit with a combination of bc and nc : specifically as205 , drtau , and scran ( and only oh in cwtau ) .",
    "these three disks are also the only ones where nc was detected in the co @xmath60 lines , possibly due to the higher s / n and dust veiling in these spectra compared to other spectra in the survey @xcite .",
    "two other disks show tentative evidence for a weak nc , but its presence can not be firmly established due to uncertainties from the photospheric correction : rulup and scras . in all disks ,",
    "the nc is about 210 times ( or more ) weaker in h@xmath14o and oh than in co , as compared to bc . in a few cases only ,",
    "the oh profile is better matched by nc rather than by bc ( dftau , rno90 , vwcha ) . in single - component disks ,",
    "oh is detected only in ec82 and twcha .",
    "figure [ fig : lum_trends ] shows the measured h@xmath14o and oh line fluxes plotted against the stellar+accretion luminosity , taken as a proxy for the irradiation and heating of inner disks . only the oh line at 30@xmath0 m shows a steady flux increase with increasing luminosity , consistent with an increasing area of the warm disk emitting region .",
    "hotter oh lines show instead a turning point at a luminosity of @xmath73l@xmath23 , beyond which line fluxes decrease ( similarly to what seen in the h@xmath14o at 33@xmath0 m ) .",
    "figure [ fig : accretion_figure ] shows the measured line fluxes plotted against the accretion luminosity alone , to highlight how line fluxes overall increase with accretion luminosity .",
    "the last two plots in the bottom right of the figure show the t - r diagram of co emission , highlighting how there is not global trend between the sequence of co gaps and the accretion luminosity and rate .",
    "oh emission is more frequently detected than water emission in disks , and is tentatively detected at 30@xmath0 m out to r@xmath30/r@xmath140 ( figure [ fig : r_fl_corr ] ) and up to larger luminosities ( figure [ fig : lum_trends ] ) , possibly supporting a still active photo - dissociation of trace amounts of h@xmath14o gas .",
    "oh formation through water photo - dissociation populates higher energy levels first ( e.g. the 12.6@xmath0 m line , see * ? ? ?",

    "it is therefore unclear whether a cold oh reservoir traced at 30@xmath0 m may be formed by photo - dissociation of h@xmath14o or by gas - phase chemistry , known to be efficient at temperatures of 100300k ( 100300k , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "future observations of velocity - resolved h@xmath14o and oh lines at wavelengths longer then 2.9@xmath0 m will be able to test if two reservoirs of oh exist : one due to uv photo - dissociation of water ( with similar line profiles for h@xmath14o and oh , as found at 2.9@xmath0 m ) , which dominates the hotter oh lines , and one due to oh formation in cold environments where water formation and/or release to the gas phase is less efficient ( by finding larger line profiles for h@xmath14o and smaller for oh ) ."
