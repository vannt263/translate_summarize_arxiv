    "the generation of spin voltage , i.e. , the potential for an electron s spin to drive spin currents , by a temperature gradient in a ferromagnet is referred to as the spin seebeck effect ( sse ) . since the first observation of the sse in a ferromagnetic metal ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 ,  @xcite this phenomenon has attracted much attention as a new method of generating spin currents from heat energy and opened a new possibility of spintronics devices .",
    "@xcite the sse triggered the emergence of the new field dubbed `` spin caloritronics ''  @xcite in the rapidly growing spintronics community .",
    "moreover , as the induced spin voltage can be converted into electric voltage through the inverse spin hall effect  @xcite at the attached nonmagnetic metal , this phenomenon put a new twist on the long and well - studied history of thermoelectric research .",
    "@xcite    one of the canonical frameworks to describe nonequilibrium transport phenomena is linear - response theory .  @xcite having been applied to a number of transport phenomena , linear - response theory has been so successful because it is intimately related to the universal fluctuation - dissipation theorem . up to now , however , the linear - response formulation of the sse has not been known mainly because , unlike the charge current , the spin current is not a conserved quantity .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to formulate the sse in terms of linear - response theory .    concerning the sse , a big mystery",
    "is now being established , which is , how can conduction electrons sustain the spin voltage over such a long range of several millimeters  @xcite in spite of the conduction electrons short spin - flip diffusion length , which is typically of several tens of nanometers ?",
    "a key to resolve this puzzle was reported by a recent experiment on electric signal transmission through a ferromagnetic insulator  @xcite which demonstrates that the spin current can be carried by the low - lying magnetic excitation of _ localized _ spins , i.e. , the magnon excitations , and that it can transmit the spin current as far as several millimeters .",
    "subsequently , the sse was reported to be observed in the magnetic insulator lay@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 despite the absence of conduction electrons .",
    "@xcite these experiments suggest that contrary to the conventional wisdom over the last two decades that the spin current is carried by _ conduction _",
    "electrons ,  @xcite the magnon is a promising candidate as a carrier for the sse .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we analyze the sse observed in lay@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4  @xcite ( hereafter referred to as yig ) in terms of magnon spin current , i.e. , a spin current carried by magnon excitations .",
    "second , we develop a framework for analyzing the sse by means of the standard linear - response formalism  @xcite which is amenable to the language of the magnetism community .",
    "@xcite this allows us to describe the spin transport phenomena systematically , and it can be easily generalized to a situation including degrees of freedom other than magnons , e.g. , conduction electrons and phonons , to describe a more complicated process in the case of metallic systems .",
    "@xcite    the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : local ] , we present a linear - response approach to the `` local '' spin injection by thermal magnons , in which the spin injection is driven by the temperature difference between the ferromagnet and the attached nonmagnetic metal .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlocal ] we develop a linear - response theory of the `` nonlocal '' spin injection by thermal magnons , in which the spin injection is driven by the temperature gradient inside the ferromagnet . as one can see below , this process can explain the sse observed in yig .",
    "@xcite finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "[ 0.3 ]    we start by briefly reviewing the sse experiment for yig .  @xcite figure  [ fig : fig1_sseins ] shows the experimental setup where several pt terminals are attached on top of a yig film in a static magnetic field @xmath5 ( @xmath6 anisotropy field ) which aligns the localized magnetic moment along @xmath7 .",
    "a temperature gradient @xmath8 is applied along the @xmath9 axis , and it induces a spin voltage across the yig / pt interface .",
    "this spin voltage then injects a spin current @xmath10 into the pt terminal ( or ejects it from the pt terminal ) .",
    "a part of the injected / ejected spin current @xmath10 is converted into a charge voltage through the so - called inverse spin hall effect :  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the absolute value of electron charge , spin hall angle , resistivity , and width of the pt terminal ( see fig .

    "hence , the observed charge voltage @xmath16 is a measure of the injected / ejected spin current @xmath10 .    to investigate the sse observed in yig",
    ", we consider a model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2_sseins](a ) . while yig is a ferrimagnet , we model it as a ferromagnet since we are interested in the low - energy properties .",
    "the key point in our model is that the temperature gradient is applied over the insulating ferromagnet , but there is _ locally _ no temperature difference between the ferromagnet and the attached nonmagnetic metals , i.e. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that each domain is initially in thermal equilibrium without interactions with the neighboring domains , and then calculate the nonequilibrium dynamics after we switch on the interactions .",
