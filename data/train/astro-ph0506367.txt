    "for poynting - dominated jets , where field lines tie the black hole to large distances , the energy flux is determined by the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the bz effect depends on the magnetic field strength near the black hole and the kerr black hole spin parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "self - consistent production of a relativistic poynting jet likely requires a rotating black hole accreting a thick disk with a disk height ( @xmath2 ) to radius ( @xmath3 ) ratio of @xmath4 @xcite . as discussed below ,",
    "a rapidly rotating ( @xmath5 ) black hole accreting a thick ( @xmath4 ) disk is probably common for jet systems .",
    "however , prior estimates of the bz power output assume the presence of an infinitely thin ( @xmath6 ) disk , only apply for @xmath7 , and do not self - consistently determine the magnetic field strength or field geometry .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide useful formulae for the total and jet blandford - znajek power for arbitrarily rapidly rotating black holes accreting a realistic disk .",
    "we also discuss the dominance of the bz effect over other relativistic jet mechanisms .",
    "the accretion of a thick disk around a rapidly rotating black hole is often invoked as the engine to power grbs @xcite .",
    "typical grb models invoke a relatively thick ( @xmath8 ) disk @xcite . during the grb event ,",
    "the black hole forms with @xmath9 and evolves to a rapidly rotating state with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "grb models based upon internal shocks require an ultrarelativistic jet with a typical lorentz factor of @xmath11 in order to overcome the compactness problem @xcite , while compton drag models require @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "direct observations of grb afterglow show evidence for relativistic motion @xcite .",
    "large lorentz factors require a relatively large jet energy flux , which could be bz - driven and poynting - dominated rather than neutrino - annihilation - driven and enthalpy - dominated @xcite .",
    "core - collapse of a rapidly rotating star leads to an inner disk with a strong uniform ( perhaps net ) poloidal field .",
    "the accretion of a relatively thick ( @xmath13 ) disk around a rapidly rotating black hole is probably the engine that powers jets from agn and some black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "both radio - loud agn and x - ray binaries in the low - hard state show a correlation between radio and x - ray emission , which is consistent with radio synchrotron emission and hard x - ray emission generated from comptonization through a thick disk @xcite .",
    "this suggests the disk is geometrically thick when a system produces a jet , where the disk is probably adaf - like with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "based on soltan - type arguments , agn each probably harbor a rapidly rotating ( @xmath10 ) black hole @xcite .",
    "agn are observed to have jets with @xmath14 @xcite , even @xmath15 @xcite , while some observations imply @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "for example , the jet in m87 shows a large - scale opening angle of @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "agn probably accrete a uniform field from solar wind capture or the ism @xcite .",
    "black hole x - ray binaries might have @xmath5 @xcite , while some may have @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "x - ray binary systems produce outflows and jets @xcite . for example , black hole x - ray binary grs 1915 + 105 has a jet with apparently superluminal motion with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "solar - wind capture x - ray binaries probably accrete a uniform field @xcite .",
    "most authors estimate the bz power based upon the @xcite model of a _ slowly _ spinning black hole threaded by a _ monopole_-based magnetic field and accreting an _ infinitely thin disk _ , which gives @xmath21\\right)^2 \\left(\\omega_h^2/c\\right ) r_g^4 , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the radial field strength , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the rotation frequency of the hole , @xmath25 is the radius of the horizon for angular momentum @xmath26 , and the dimensionless kerr parameter has @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28  @xmath29 , where the uncertainty in @xmath30 arises because the strength of the magnetic field is not self - consistently determined ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "grmhd numerical models of slowly spinning , accreting black holes mostly agree with the bz model for the nearly force - free funnel region of the poynting - dominated jet @xcite .    the force - free solution for the monopole bz flux is @xmath31 @xcite , but the accretion of a relatively thick disk diminishes total bz power output substantially @xcite .",
    "this is because the electromagnetic energy accreted as a disk dominates the energy extracted .",
    "some black hole spin energy does escape into the diffuse part of the corona , so the coronal outflow has more poynting flux for faster spinning holes @xcite .",
    "for rapidly rotating black holes , the field is no longer monopolar and a significant amount of flux is generated closer to the nearly force - free poles .    )",
    "least squares fit to @xmath32 formulae .",

    "the evolved field geometry is relevant to most black hole systems and corresponds to a turbulent disk field with a self - consistently generated large - scale flux threading the black hole .",

    "there is a weak dependence on @xmath4 for the _ jet _ bz power or efficiency since the thicker the disk , the less solid angle available to the jet , but the field strength there is larger in compensation .",

    "this demonstrates the competition between electromagnetic energy extraction and accretion .",
    "notice that no direct comparison can be cleanly made to equation  [ pbz ] due to the presence of two ambiguities @xmath30 and @xmath22 , while our formulae have no ambiguities .",
    "we suggest using the power output as given by equations  [ emtoteff ] and  [ emjeteff ] . the black hole mass accretion rate must be determined independent of @xmath0 using a model - dependent study .",
    "the coefficient in the formulae above depends on the type of accreted field geometry . as an extreme example",
    ", the accretion of a net vertical field leads to an increase in the net electromagnetic efficiency by a factor of five @xcite .",
    "also , the accretion of a net toroidal field leads to negligible energy extraction @xcite .",
    "future studies should focus on the physical relevance , stability , and long - temporal evolution of accreting net toroidal and vertical fields with realistic perturbations rather than exact symmetries .",
    "accretion of a net vertical field has been studied with nonrelativistic mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "for the collapsar model with black hole mass @xmath64 feeding at an accretion rate of @xmath65 , the magnetic field at the poles of an @xmath66 black hole is @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this gives a per polar axis poynting flux jet energy of @xmath69 .",
    "notice that the neutrino annihilation jet luminosity for such a collapsar model gives @xmath70 @xcite , so these processes are likely both important . however , realistic models suggest that poynting flux dominates neutrino - annihilation energy flux @xcite .",
    "similar estimates can be made for agn and x - ray binaries .",
    "figure  [ fieldtypes ] shows the possible types of field geometries in the disk ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "field type # 1 corresponds to the balbus - hawley instability @xcite , which is present in our simulations .",
    "field type # 2 corresponds to models for which the field ties material inside the isco to the outer disk @xcite .",
    "as they predicted , unlike in the @xmath71-viscosity model , there is no feature at the isco or a direct plunge into the black hole @xcite , which impacts any radiative model of the inner - radial accretion disk .",
    "field type # 3 corresponds to models that consider the role of the black hole and disk on the disk efficiency @xcite .",
    "they suggested that efficiencies of order unity or higher could be achieved by extracting energy from the hole .",
    "this field type is present , but the disk efficiency is near the thin disk efficiency @xcite .",
    "thus , surprisingly , the magnetic field and disk thickness play little role in modifying the disk efficiency .",
    "in contrast , the angular momentum accreted is reduced by magnetic field lines that tie from the disk to the hole @xcite .",
    "field types # 4 and # 5 correspond to surface reconnections .",
    "type # 4 geometries are temporary and type # 5 are common .",
    "thus , reconnection efficiently removes large loops that tie the disk to itself .",
    "field type # 6 corresponds to the blandford - payne type model @xcite .",
    "we find that the lab - frame @xmath72 as in their model , but the lab - frame @xmath73 instead of their @xmath74 and there are few such field lines present in a stable configuration due to the inner - radial corona being convectively unstable and magnetically unstable to magnetic buoyancy .",
    "thin disks likely have more stable surfaces that might allow for a stable wind .",
    "field type # 7 corresponds to coronal outflows or ergospheric - driven winds @xcite .",
    "there are no dynamically stable field lines that tie the inner - radial disk to large distances . even for @xmath75",
    ", no additional poynting flux is created in the ergosphere and the electromagnetic energy at infinity completely dominates the hydrodynamic energy at infinity associated with the mhd penrose process , in basic agreement with the results of @xcite and counter to the results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite evolved for much too short a time .",
    "@xcite used the 3d grmhd near - horizon results of @xcite , but their near - horizon results could have numerical artifacts associated with their use of boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "however , there is a convectively and magnetically unstable , self - consistently mass - loaded , collimated , mildly relativistic ( @xmath76 ) coronal outflow @xcite .",
    "a rotating black hole is not required for nonrelativistic ( @xmath77 ) coronal outflows @xcite .",
    "field type # 8 corresponds to @xcite type models .",
    "these field geometries appear rarely and do not transfer a significant amount of energy or angular momentum .",
    "such geometries may be more important for thin disks .",
    "field type # 9 , the dominant feature , is associated with the blandford - znajek model . since the magnetic field confines the disk matter away from the polar region , the rest - mass flux there is arbitrarily low . the large bz flux to low rest - mass flux ratio can translate into an arbitrarily fast jet .",
    "the mass - loading of this jet is considered in @xcite .",
    "notice that for accretion models with a net vertical field , the resulting structure is essentially identical @xcite .",
    "reconnection efficiently erases the initial geometrical differences .",
    "typical bz power output estimates assume an infinitely thin disk , a slowly rotating black hole , and do not self - consistently determine the magnitude or geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "we use grmhd numerical models to self - consistently determine the total and jet bz efficiency when a disk is present .",
    "there is a significantly stronger dependence on black hole spin than prior estimates suggest .",
    "near the rotating black hole , the field geometry of the accretion system is dominated by the field that leads to the bz - effect . since the polar region is magnetically confined against disk material and the bz power is large , the jet lorentz factor can be arbitrarily large .",
    "this is unlike disk - related jet mechanisms that are directly loaded by disk material .",
