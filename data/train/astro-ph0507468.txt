    "the first one was a type ii outburst caught by vela 5b in 1973 , with a duration of @xmath8 100 days and peak intensity of 1.6 crab ( terrell and priedhorsky 1984 ) .",
    "a spin period of 4.37 s and an orbital period of 34 days were discovered ( whitlock 1989 ) . according to the classification of outburst in stella et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , this type ii outburst was an irregular transient activity with timing unrelated to any underlying orbital period .",
    "the second outburst was detected by tenma satellite 10 years later ( tanaka et al .",
    "the follow - up series of observations performed by exosat showed the outbursts were type i  periodic transient activities with occurring time close to the time of periastron passage  and measured the orbit with a moderate eccentricity of 0.31@xmath00.03 and a projected semimajor axis of 48@xmath04 lt - s ( stella et al .",
    "1985 ) . favored by the precise source location attained with exosat",
    ", the companion was identified in the optical as an early - type star , bq cam ( honeycutt and schlegel 1985 ) , and distance to the source was estimated to be 2.25.8 kpc ( corbet et al .",
    "v0332 + 53 was found to be active again by ginga in 1989 ( tsunemi et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the outburst was classified as type ii and a feature of 0.05 hz qpo was reported ( takeshima et al . 1994 ) .",
    "a cyclotron absorption component observed at 28.5 kev suggested that the magnetic filed could be as high as 2.5@xmath610@xmath10 g on surface of the neutron star ( makishima et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the most recent outburst was detected by the all sky monitor ( asm ) of rxte in november 2004 , followed by integral target of opportunity ( too ) observations at hard x - rays .",
    "three cyclotron lines detected in integral ( kreykenbohm et al .",
    "2005 ) confirmed the earlier report in rxte ( coburn et al .",
    "the intensity averaged on december 22 were about 1.2 crab in the 1.512 kev band and 2.2 crab in the 512 kev band .",
    "an additional feature of 0.22 hz qpo was discovered from pca / rxte to ride on the spin frequency ( qu et al . 2005 ) . in this letter",
    "we report the measurement of current orbital parameters with rxte / integral data and the trend of pulse evolution with time .",
    "the public data we have analyzed are shown in figure 1 both for pca / rxte and integral observations of v0332 + 53 during the outburst .",
    "the pca / rxte data are collected within time periods of december 28 - 30 in 2004 , january 5 - 6 , 15 - 19 , february 12 - 15 , and march 7 in 2005 .",
    "the typical exposure of individual observation are several thousand seconds and the neighboring observations are combined to have the largest time span of roughly half day . the arrival time is corrected to the barycenter for each photon ( 2 - 60 kev ) .",
    "integral too observations are available for 9 revolutions during january - february 2005",
    ". isgri / ibis data of revolutions 272 - 274 ( pointings 75 , 66 and 82 ) ( @xmath11 15 kev ) are adopted in our analysis .",
    "the source intensity went down thereafter and the later observations do not allow precisely deriving the spin period .",
    "the revolution 272 was carried out in staring mode and the other two revolutions in hexagonal dithering mode ( for definitions see chernyakova 2004 ) .",
    "the total exposure considered are about 110 ksec for these three revolutions .",
    "to further improve the statistics , the neighboring science windows of pointing in each revolution are combined to enlarge the time span to @xmath8 10@xmath12 seconds .",
    "data reduction is performed using the latest version ( 4.2 ) of the standard integral offline science analysis ( osa ) software .",
    "the photons with pixel illuminated factor 1 are extracted and the arrival time is corrected to the barycenter ( chernyakova 2004 ) .",
    "the orbital parameters of binary system can be measured through fitting the radial - velocity curve .",
    "the radial velocity ( @xmath13 ) of orbital motion will modulate the spin period ( @xmath14 ) of neutron star through the doppler effect as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the change rate of spin period and @xmath17 the observed spin period . for representation of @xmath13 by the orbital parameters see hilditch ( 2001 ) . the systemic velocity is not considered since the @xmath13 profile is not modulated with a constant velocity .",
    "finally we have 7 fundamental parameters to be inferred from fitting the @xmath17 curve .",
    "the spin period is searched in observational data by using @xmath18 of the ftool software package .",
    "the resolution and the number of phase bins ( @xmath19 ) are chosen as 1@xmath610@xmath7 s and 200 , respectively .",
    "the derived @xmath20 curves are fitted by gaussians , to estimate the most likely value of @xmath17 .",
    "its error is roughly taken to the first order as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total time of observation , varying from 10@xmath23 to 10@xmath12 s. we note that the variation of @xmath13 within @xmath22 is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 = @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the eccentric anomaly . for the first trial in the fitting , the uncertainty in @xmath13 is taken as 2@xmath28@xmath29/@xmath30 , i.e. with zero eccentricity and other parameters coming from stella et al . ( 1985 ) .",

    "are then revised .",
    "the obtained spin periods from isgri / ibis and pca / rxte are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the data are fit again and the best - fit parameters are shown in table 1 . the reduced @xmath31 remains almost unchanged ( 26 dofs ) .",
    "the 1 sigma errors are obtained by adding 8.1 to the minimum @xmath31-value as is appropriate for 7 parameters of interest .",
    "the results are consistent within error bars with those obtained 21 years ago for those parameters of @xmath32 , @xmath30 , and @xmath14 , but not for @xmath34 and periastron longitude @xmath35 .",
    "the neutron star passed through periastron at the time when the source had peak intensity .",
    "we find that the neutron star spun up with a rate of 8.01@xmath5@xmath610@xmath7 s / day during the outburst .      to obtain the absolute phase one has to subtract the effect of orbital motion from the photon arrival time .",
    "the main uncertainty in such correction comes from that in @xmath36 , which could be as large as 6 - 10 seconds in our data and is insufficient for precisely obtaining the absolute phase at different time .",
    "we therefore co - align the phase by taking one of the two bridges for double - pulse light curves but use arbitrary phase for light curve with single pulse ( figure 3 ) . as shown in figure 1 , there are five data groups representing different intensity levels of the outburst . for each time period",
    "the typical light curve is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "the light curves are dominated by broad , asymmetric double pulses when the source was at high intensity level within mjd 53367 - 53376 .",
    "the two pulses become narrower and symmetric as the source intensity went down to middle level in mjd 53386 .",
    "roughly 30 days later , when the outburst evolved to the tail , the two pulses started to move closer .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , phase separation of the two pulses remained roughly constant ( @xmath8 0.47 ) when the source was bright , and dropped from 0.47 to 0.37 within less than 3 days ( mjd 53413 - 53416 ) at a low intensity level . in mjd 53436",
    "the outburst almost ceased and only a single gaussian - shaped pulse appears in the light curve .",
    "the single pulse precludes estimating phase separation in the light curve .",
    "nevertheless , a zero phase separation would be consistent with the trend as seen in the preceding data ( see dotted line in figure 1 ) .",
    "some orbital parameters recovered from pca ( rxte ) and isgri / ibis ( integral ) observations on the recent outburst of v0332 + 53 differ from those of stella et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . to investigate such differences in detail we tracked the procedure of parameter measurements in stella et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , where the orbital parameters were estimated based on fitting nine values of @xmath17 . to fully repeat their work is difficult because only five values of @xmath17 were presented in their paper .",
    "fortunately , the outburst was also monitored by tenma during 1983 - 1984 , and additional five values of @xmath17 were published in makishima et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . by fitting these ten data points ,",
    "the orbital parameters are obtained with values consistent with those of stella et al .",
    "the spin - up rate @xmath16 is set to zero as well , i.e. to follow stella et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and the reduced @xmath31 is 0.85 .",
    "cross checking on the consistency of data with different sets of orbital parameters is also performed . with @xmath16 being free , both fitting the exosat / tenma data with the parameters derived from rxte / integral and fitting rxte / integral data with the parameters of stella et al .",
    "( 1985 ) result the reduced @xmath31 far beyond 1 .",
    "this provides evidence for a change in the orbital parameters since 1984 .",
    "stella et al . ( 1985 ) reminded that their orbital parameters are only valid under very small value of @xmath16 , the contemporary value of which was however unknown . through fitting the exosat / tenma data",
    ", we find also that @xmath16 can not be constrained : very good fits could be established under quite different values of @xmath16 .",
    "this may due to the relatively poor coverage of the orbital phase with only 10 data points .",
    "the orbital phase coverage is now improved with as much as 33 data points originated from the rxte / integral observations and the fit can only be acceptable by including @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we tend to believe that the orbital parameters obtained from rxte / integral have less uncertainty compared to those of stella et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .",
    "the inconsistency of the combined exosat / tenma data with the current orbital parameters suggests that at least some of the orbital elements have changed in the past 21 years . in case that the orbital parameters of stella et al .",
    "( 1985 ) are appropriate as well , i.e. assuming the contemporary value of @xmath16 was very small , @xmath34 should have increased from 48@xmath04 to 86@xmath1 lt - s and @xmath35 decreased from 313@xmath2@xmath010 to 283@xmath2@xmath014 .",
    "this would then imply a rotation of the orbit with an angular velocity @xmath3 1.5@xmath2@xmath00.8 yr@xmath4 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath34 between stella s results and ours is 1.79@xmath00.25 . by assuming no change in semimajor axis and inclination angle ,",
    "this value is consistent within 1 @xmath33 error bar with the ratio 1.34@xmath00.22 represented by the periastron longitude .",
    "such consistency lies in the fact that any rotation of the orbit would lead to subsequently changing in the projection of semimajor axis along the line of sight .",
    "the rotation of orbit in its own plane , usually defined as apsidal motion , was widely detected in binary systems of different configuration ( petrova and orlov , 1999 ) .",
    "apsidal motion can be induced by a variety of effects in perturbing gravitational potential , including the rotational potential , the tidal potential as well as the general - relativity corrections to newtonian gravitational theory . for an idealized newtonian binary system ,",
    "the period of apsidal motion ( p@xmath37 ) is @xmath38^{-1}$ ] ( schwarzschild 1958 ) . here",
    "@xmath39 is the apsidal constant , @xmath40 the semimajor axis of the relative orbit and the contribution from neutron star is neglected . with @xmath39 @xmath8 0.008 for a main - sequence star ( stothers 1974 )",
    ", a companion of @xmath41 @xmath8 20 @xmath42 and a neutron star of @xmath43@xmath8 1.44 @xmath42 , the apsidal period is estimated to be @xmath8 8.6@xmath610@xmath44 yr , corresponding to an angular velocity @xmath45 @xmath8 4@xmath2@xmath610@xmath46 yr@xmath4 . the contribution from general - relativity corrections is @xmath47 ( hilditch 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath45 is then estimated as @xmath8 5@xmath2@xmath610@xmath48 yr@xmath4 for v0332 + 53 .",
    "one sees that an angular velocity @xmath8 1.5@xmath2@xmath00.8 yr@xmath4 can not be accounted for from the contributions of both effects .",
    "apsidal motion could also be an intrinsic phenomenon for a triple system .",
    "it is recognized that roughly 20 percent of binary system are members of triple or multiple systems .",
    "the argument of apsidal motion in a triple system depends on the so - called mass - distance relation ( wilson and fox 1981 ) .",
    "an adjustment on mass and distance of the desired third body can induce large @xmath45 , e.g. wilson and fox ( 1981 ) explained the rapid apsidal period of 4.5 yr for the hmxb cyg x-1 in terms of a perturbing third body . the apsidal motion of @xmath45 @xmath8 1.5@xmath2@xmath00.8 yr@xmath4 in v0332 + 53 ,",
    "if it is true , may need to be understood in a scheme of triple system .    for compact system with small orbital period ( typically less than 1 day )",
    ", the angular velocity of the apsidal motion could be as large as several degrees ",
    "hundred degrees per year ( petrova and orlov , 1999 ) . for x - ray binary system with long orbital period ,",
    "the largest rate of apsidal motion observed so far may be in vel x-1 ( orbital period 8.97 days ) with an angular velocity of 6.9@xmath493.4 yr@xmath4 ( boynton et al .",
    ". a rate of apsidal motion very close to v0332 + 53 was reported for ss433 ( orbital period 13.08 days ) with an angular speed of 2.45@xmath2@xmath00.44 yr@xmath4 ( petrova and orlov , 1999 ) .    with a mass function of 0.58 m@xmath50 , binary system v0332 + 53",
    "consisting of a companion of @xmath320 m@xmath50 and a neutron star of 1.44 m@xmath50 would require an inclination angle of the orbit to be @xmath9 18.9@xmath2 .",
    "with such an inclination angle , the rotational velocity of the companion o - type star is then estimated as 480 km s @xmath4  well below the break - up velocity 600 km s @xmath4 typical for a late o - type star ( negueruela et al .",
    "therefore , the evidence once reported by negueruela et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a tilt between orbit and equatorial plane does not hold any more under the measurements of current orbital parameters .",
    "the periastron passage time ( @xmath51 ) of mjd 53367@xmath01 is just around the time when the intensity reached maximum and an orbital period earlier is the time when the outburst started ( @xmath8mjd 53332 , swank et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this correlation resembles the behavior of a type i outburst . during the outburst a spin - up rate of 8.01@xmath5@xmath610@xmath7 s day@xmath4 is derived .",
