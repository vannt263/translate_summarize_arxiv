    "[ white_noise ] the linear josephson coupling @xmath13 is set to support a st state .",
    "the spontaneous formation of vorticity for each component can be regarded as independent from each other for the current pumping configuration .",
    "the resulted sate is an imperfect azimuthon vortex state .",
    "the same process also applies to spontaneous formation of homogeneous vortex states and striped states .",
    "in conclusion , by using a dynamical mean - field model to describe two - component exciton - polariton condensate formed in the incoherent spin - polarized puming regime , we have demonstrated existence and dynamical stability of vortex azimuthons and spin patterns in an annular trapping geometry imposed by the pumping geometry . we have investigated the intrinsic connection between these nontrivial spin structures and internal josephson currents supported by a linear polarization splitting .",
    "our results are generally applicable to other open - dissipative systems in the context of atomic becs and nonlinear optics .",
