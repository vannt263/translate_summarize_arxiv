    "the so - called y - junction string three - quark potential , defined by @xmath3 has long been advertised @xcite as the natural approximation to the flux tube confinement mechanism , that is allegedly active in qcd .",
    "lattice investigations , refs .",
    "@xcite , however , contradict each other in their attempts to distinguish between the y - string , fig .",
    "[ y_3q ] , and the @xmath4-string potential , see fig .",
    "[ d_3q ] ,    @xmath5    which , in turn , is indistinguishable from the sum of three linear two - body potentials .",
    "the present point of view held among the lattice qcd practitioners is that there should be a smooth cross - over from the @xmath4 to the y - potential at interquark distances of around 0.8 fm @xcite .",
    "exactly how this cross - over should be implemented is not clear just now .",
    "moreover , quantum fluctuations of the three flux tubes lead to l \" uscher type corrections in the potential @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of such corrections is beyond the scope of the present paper .    over the past 25 years",
    ", the y - string potential has been used in several , more or less systematic studies of baryons in the ( constituent ) quark model with various hyperfine interactions @xcite , and yet some of the most basic predictions of this potential acting alone , i.e. without hyperfine interaction , such as the spectrum of the low - lying three - quark states remain unknown . the older calculations @xcite treat the y - string potential only in first - order perturbation theory , whereas the more recent ones @xcite invoke equivalence with @xmath4 string potential - string potentials are essentially indistinguishable \" ] , up to an overall multiplicative factor @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) for the string tension @xmath8 .",
    "that leads us to a third set of calculations that rely on the ( as yet not proven )  equivalence \" of the y - string potential and the @xmath4 string one to look for the  best two - body approximants \" to the y - string potential , see refs . @xcite and follow - up references .",
    "note , however , that these papers use only the hyper - radial approximation and they are only concerned with the overall strength of the coupling .",
    "we wish to resolve this dilemma using analytical methods , whenever possible .",
    "so , at least for the time being , we have to resort to calculations in the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "we shall not repeat the two - body @xmath4 string potential calculation , as there is a large body of literature on the subject : instead , we shall use the paper by j.m .",
    "richard and p. taxil @xcite as a benchmark . that paper uses the hyper - spherical harmonics method , which we also use , with only a slightly different practical implementation : whereas ref .",
    "@xcite uses the jacobi coordinates ( see sect .",
    "[ s : potential ] ) in the evaluation of the relevant matrix elements , we shall evaluate them directly in the hyperspherical variables .    for the sake of completeness and clarity we shall start with two extensive technical preparatory sections : first , in sect .",
    "[ s : potential ] we outline the three main technical problems , and then in sect .",
    "[ s : method ] we address them one after another ; for this reason we divide sect . [",
    "s : method ] , in which we formulate the methods that we use , into three parts : the first one , sect .",
    "[ s : ang ] , is about the angular momentum recoupling algebra necessary to deal with the non - conserved  partial \" angular momenta , the second part , sect .",
    "[ s : pert ] , deals with the square root(s ) in the y - string potential , and finally the third one , sect .",
    "[ s : nonpert ] , addresses all four forms of the string potential together .",
    "our results are shown in sect .",
    "[ s : results ] , which is divided into four parts : one part that comprises sect .",
    "[ s : pert - result ] deals with the first - order perturbative approximation results , wherein the angular dependence is treated as a ( small ) perturbation to the linear potential oscillator , sect .",
    "[ s : hsy - d ] and two with non - perturbative ones in sect .",
    "[ s : allorder - result ] : one for the y - string potential in sect .",
    "[ s : hsy - d1 ] , and another for the complete string potential in sect .",
    "[ s:2string - result ] .",
    "the final section [ s : summary ] contains a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "a number of technical issues are discussed in appendices [ s : y - hspert],[s : y - hs me],[s : hrad ] .",
    "the complexity of the potential eq .",
    "( [ conf_y ] ) is best seen when expressed in terms of three - body jacobi ( relative ) coordinates @xmath9 @xmath10 { \\bm \\lambda}&= & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}({\\bf x_1 } + { \\bf x_2}- 2 { \\bf x_3 } ) , \\label{e : lambda } \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as follows .",
    "the exact string potential eq .",
    "( [ conf_y ] ) consists of the so - called y - string , or three - string term , @xmath11 and three angle - dependent two - part string , or the so - called v - string , terms ,    @xmath12    here , the reasons for the lack of use of the exact potential eq .",
    "( [ conf_y ] ) become clear : i ) it is a genuine three - body operator with a complicated and unusual (  area term \" ) angular dependence under the square - root of the most important term ( the y - junction string potential ) that leads to the non - conservation of the individual jacobi coordinates angular momenta @xcite and hugely complicates the equations of motion ; ii ) the square - roots appearing in all four functional forms of the potential make this task even more difficult ; iii ) the presence of four different functional forms of the potential depending on the configuration space angles makes the integration of the equations of motion difficult as one can not easily separate the angular and radial integrals .    perhaps the simplest , yet realistic approximation to the exact string potential eq .",
    "( [ conf_y ] ) is the y - string , or the  three - string \" potential , eq .",
    "( [ hypvy1a ] ) , that is used in the whole configuration space , i.e. , even when one of the angles in the triangle exceeds @xmath13 . in that way",
    "one avoids the cumbersome transition to the v - string potentials , see problem iii ) above .",
    ", i.e. for the radial excitations of the s - wave ground state , and presumably a good one for low values of the orbital angular momenta . we shall show below that this claim is incorrect , however .",
    "] still , even this simplified approximation suffers from two difficulties mentioned above : i ) an unusual (  area term \" ) angular dependence under the square - root that leads to the non - conservation of the individual jacobi coordinates angular momenta ; ii ) the square - root .",
    "we shall address these problems in successive steps : i ) the area term turns out to be exactly ( analytically ) integrable , but it requires complicated angular momenta recoupling algebra and the exact value of a particular one dimensional angular integral .",
    "problem ii ) , the square root , can be treated , at first , by a series expansion , i.e. in perturbation theory , and then by numerical evaluation of the complete functional expression , i.e. in non - perturbative approximation . finally , the last issue iii ) is tackled , at the price of considerable inconvenience : the necessary hyperangular matrix elements of the complete three - body potential can be evaluated using above mentioned methods , except that two previously separate integrals ( over one quasi - radial and one angular variable ) have to be performed simultaneously , as the integration boundaries involve both variables .",
    "it turns out that the crucial ingredient for the success of this effort is the application of the so - called hyper - spherical coordinates / angles @xcite , or a particular variation thereof , the cosines of the relative angle @xmath14 between the jacobi coordinates @xmath9 and of the angle @xmath15 defined by way of the ratio of the moduli @xmath16 of the two jacobi coordinates .",
    "the hyper - spherical method has been used widely in the few - body atomic and nuclear physics , for review see ref .",
    "@xcite , but we are aware of only one paper , ref .",
    "@xcite , that uses it in the context of the three - quark y - string problem , which is perhaps ironic , as it turns out to be the most natural set of coordinates for the problem at hand , whereas its use in two - body atomic and nuclear potential problems is plagued by slow convergence of the expansion .",
    "some papers have applied the hyper - radial approximation to the three - quark problem @xcite , but that misses the essential points discussed here .",
    "the first problem ( angular momentum ) is generic to all ( string ) three - body potentials and is thus independent of the approximation used , so its solution will be used subsequently in both perturbative and non - perturbative approximations .",
    "moreover , its solution can be incorporated into the hyper - spherical formalism that will used later .",
    "for this reason we start with the angular momentum recoupling .",
    "the  vector cross - product , or the  area term \" @xmath17 in this potential has some curious properties in classical and quantum mechanics : it conserves the sum @xmath18 of the two partial ( orbital ) angular momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but not their difference @xcite , i.e. , the individual ( orbital ) angular momenta are not conserved . as a consequence , there can be  spilling \" of the orbital angular momentum from the @xmath21 ( normal ) mode into the @xmath22 one and _ vice versa_.",
    "only the radial excitations of the s - wave ground state remain immune to this spillage .",
    "we need to evaluate matrix elements of the following form @xmath23 and @xmath24_{l=0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is to be inserted into @xmath25 capstick and isgur , ref .",
    "@xcite have reduced the angular matrix elements eq .",
    "( [ e : sinme ] ) to @xmath26 and racah @xmath27 coefficients , which can be found in standard collections of angular momentum tables , such as ref .",
    "@xcite , and an integral over even-@xmath28 order legendre polynomials @xmath29 that can be reduced to a ratio of double - factorial functions @xcite : @xmath30 in table [ tab : drcc1a ] we show the dependence of these matrix elements on the  partial \" orbital angular momenta @xmath31 - note in particular the non - vanishing off - diagonal matrix element that ensures the existence of the mass - splitting  mixing \" terms in the @xmath32 $ ] and the @xmath33$]-plets .",
    "note that all of the angular matrix elements are exact integer or fractional multiples of the basic unit @xmath34 , thus leading to the analytic form of the angular matrix elements , shown in the eighth column of table [ tab : drcc1a ] .",
    "we do not need the hyper - radial wave functions in order to complete the calculation of the radial matrix elements ; rather , we use the virial theorem @xmath37 to determine the expectation value @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the power of @xmath40 in the potential @xmath41 , in terms of the energy eigenvalue @xmath42 of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
