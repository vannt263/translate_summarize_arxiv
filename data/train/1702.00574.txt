    "we next considered nonuniform tori where the up - down symmetry of the system is broken , resulting in swimming .",
    "we examined a smoothed approximation to the activity of a janus torus , as such first - mode regularizations of janus particles are used in the study of spherical janus particles  @xcite , and then we compared it against a full janus torus where we took both the surface activity and mobility to have step discontinuities at @xmath198 and @xmath199 . in maximising the swimming velocity of the nonuniform tori with respect to fixed surface area , we found ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) that ( b ) the optimal smoothed - activity torus , has a larger aspect ratio than the optimum for the full janus torus with the same uniform mobility , ( c ) .",
    "the optimal swimmers , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , all have smaller aspect ratios than ( a ) the optimal phoretic pump ; unlike the pump , swimmers must not only maximize surface concentration gradients , but also minimize drag .",
    "the smaller aspect ratios result from the balance of these two effects .",
    "while our study focused on neutral solutes and self - diffusiophoresis , if suitably modified the results may be applied to other phoretic mechanisms .",
    "for instance , the auto - thermophoretic torus may be studied provided that both the mechanism of heating is axisymmetric , and additionally the interior problem of heat conduction through the torus is solved .",
    "the slip - velocity is then the gradient of the temperature field at the torus surface  @xcite , and the flow solution proceeds as before . for electrophoresis ,",
    "the situation is more complex as in general it also involves charge transport through the material ; slip velocity would then be proportional to the electric field on the torus surface  @xcite , with activity corresponding to electrical current injected into the flow at the surface  @xcite .",
    "the torus is arguably the simplest system that naturally exhibits geometric confinement , an important property that can influence the motion of diffusiophoretic particles leading to physical effects such as boundary steering  @xcite and dynamic self assembly  @xcite .",
    "our results provide a means of probing confinement effects analytically , demonstrating key differences between pumps and swimmers .",
