    "vlbi observations of water megamasers on ( sub-)pc scales in active galaxies have proven to be a basic tool for investigating the central regions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the most impressive result from this kind of research was the discovery of a thin , nearly edge - on rotating disk around a super massive black hole at the center of ngc4258 @xcite .",
    "the vlbi observations revealed the size and the shape of the slightly - warped maser disk with a central radio jet outflowing perpendicularly to the disk plane @xcite .",
    "vlbi imaging of the water megamasers in ngc1068 , ngc4945 and the circinus galaxy showed the possible existence of super massive objects at their nuclei similar to ngc4258 @xcite . according to the most recent result , in the seyfert 2 galaxy ic2560 , the barely resolved maser spots which constitute the systemic emission show a linear velocity gradient along the north - south elongation and",
    "are accompanied by continuum emission , probably suggesting a super massive black hole inside a rotating disk @xcite . in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 ,",
    "in addition to the nuclear disk - maser , non - disk maser emission was found some 30 pc away along the jet from the radio nucleus , that might be the result of interaction between the jet and the interstellar gas @xcite . in the elliptical galaxy ngc1052 ,",
    "the interpretation of non - disk masers was introduced to explain the water masers seen lying along the jet @xcite .",
    "water megamasers seem to fall into two categories : nuclear masers residing in a ( sub-)parsec scale disk around an active nucleus and non - nuclear masers which are seen significantly further from the nucleus .",
    "the latter can also be classified into two types , that is , jet masers associated with radio jets and outflow masers  a wind component discovered in circinus @xcite .",
    "the study of non - disk maser emission is equally important for the investigation of the overall structure surrounding an active nucleus . in order to understand the megamaser phenomenon , and to deduce the general characteristics of the central parsecs of agn , such as black hole masses and accretion rates , it is important to investigate as many megamasers as possible with vlbi imaging at milliarcsecond angular resolutions . so far ,",
    "more than 20 galaxies are reported to contain megamasers ( e.g. , braatz et al .",
    "1997 , falcke et al .",
    "most of them , however , show weak intensities , and some are thus not observable with vlbi @xcite .",

    "we observed the 6@xmath6 maser line at 22 ghz ( rest frequency : 22.23508 ghz ) toward ngc5793 for 8 hours on 1998 may 10 using the vlba and the phased vla .",
    "the use of the vla as the eleventh array element was critical to the observation because the peak flux density of the maser emission is known to be very weak ( @xmath7 0.1 jy ) .",

    "+ the continuum and line maps were both made from differently weighted data to get reasonable sensitivities , resulting in a synthesized beam size of 2.8 @xmath9 1.8 mas for the continuum map , and 1.8 @xmath9 1.0 mas for the line map .",
    "the rms noise levels are 1.3 mjy beam@xmath10  for the continuum map produced from a single bandwidth of 8  mhz and 4.3 mjy beam@xmath10  for the continuum - subtracted line map for each averaged channel . the continuum emission was subtracted only in the region close to c1(c ) .      the 1.7 , 8.4 , and 15  ghz continuum observations were made on 1999 october 10 , using 8 elements of the vlba .",
    "the vlba stations brewster  ( br ) and saint croix  ( sc ) did not take part in the observations .",
    "the four 8 mhz if bands with left circular polarization were recorded using 2 bit sampling across a total bandwidth of 32 mhz .",
    "we used the frequency agility of the vlba to switch rapidly among the three frequencies to obtain better ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) coverages with optimal observing time .",
    "the observing frequencies were switched typically every 7 10 minutes between 8.4 and 15  ghz .",
    "the 1.7 ghz observation was inserted among the other two frequencies about every 40 minutes .",
    "the 8.4 and 15  ghz observations were made using the phase - referencing method , with the same calibrator as at 22  ghz . at 8.4 ghz a total cycle time of about 4 minutes",
    "was used for the calibrator and the galaxy ; 3-minute scans on the calibrator and 1-minute scans for the target source were employed . at 15  ghz ,",

    "the data were calibrated using standard aips software .",
    "the amplitude calibration was made with observations of 4c39.25 and 3c345 .",
    "the centroid position of the 8.4 ghz continuum source was determined from the phase - referenced map .",
    "finally , self - calibration was used on the data at 1.7 and 8.4 ghz to improve the sensitivity of images with difmap .",
    "+ the maps were made from uniformly weighted data and the resultant synthesized beam sizes are 23 @xmath9 3.7 mas at 1.7 ghz , 7.0 @xmath9 2.7 mas at 8.4 ghz , and 2.9 @xmath9 0.6 mas at 15  ghz .",
    "the rms noise levels are 0.86 mjy beam@xmath10  for the 1.7 ghz map , 0.35 mjy beam@xmath10  for the 8.4 ghz map , and 0.82 mjy beam@xmath10  for the 15  ghz map at total bandwidths of 32  mhz .",
    "the positional errors ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) in the vlbi images , dominated by statistical noise , were estimated from the synthesized beam size ( @xmath15 ) divided by the signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) .",
    "when we estimate relative positional errors between line and continuum maps , they are approximately given by the the equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent maser and continuum emission images .",
    "thus , the relative positional error between one of the maser lines at the v@xmath4= 3194 km s@xmath2feature and the 22 ghz continuum peak c1(c ) is @xmath19 @xmath7 0.22 mas .",
    "+ the common reference positions ( 0 , 0 ) ( continuum peak c1(c ) ) were determined at various frequencies by phase - referencing to the compact source , 1507@xmath8168 .",
    "this same calibrator was used for all the observing epochs and there seemed to be neither structural nor positional changes between the two epochs , may 1998 and october 1999 .",
    "the alignment of the reference positions between the 22 and 8.4 ghz continuum maps was determined from the phase - referenced maps .",
    "assuming that the position error of the common reference source and any structural changes of the reference source between epochs are negligible , the relative positional error between 22 ghz ( @xmath20 ) and 8.4 ghz ( @xmath21 ) is estimated as the following , @xmath22 where @xmath18 and @xmath23 represent continuum images of a target source and a phase - reference source . in our analysis , the third and fourth term in the formula are negligible as snr of reference calibrator images are better by on the order of 10  100  than those of masers or 22 and 8.4 ghz continuum images of ngc5793 .",
    "consequently , the relative uncertainty of the maser position with respect to the reference point at 8.4 ghz in fig .  [ fig3 ] is @xmath24 = @xmath25 @xmath7 0.2 mas .",

    "the 22 ghz peak is coincident with c1(c ) in the 8.4 ghz map to an accuracy of 0.25 mas , as estimated in the previous section .",

    "c2(c ) and c2(w ) have similar spectra : @xmath32 and @xmath33 between 5.0 and 8.4 ghz , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 between 1.7 and 5.0 ghz .",

    "[ fig5 ] is a blueshifted spectrum that shows the total flux density obtained from our vlba observations .",
    "the spectrum appears to be a scaled - down version of the the single - dish spectrum , which suggests that about 50 % of the peak flux density is detected in vlba observations .",
    "this might be explained by the intrinsic intensity variability of the water emission or by a loss of coherence during phase referencing @xcite or , of course , by a combination of both .",
    "given the total maser intensity ( 0.78 jy km s@xmath2 ) estimated from the vlba spectrum shown in the inset in fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the spatial distribution of the water maser spots , where the position of each maser feature was determined by gaussian fitting for each emission peak in the deconvolved images that was detected above 4@xmath37 level .",
    "our analysis showed that the detected maser emission is split into two clusters with a separation of @xmath7 0.7 mas , or 0.16 pc , but there is no discernible velocity structure .",
    "each maser clump , assuming a nominal size of 0.2 mas , yields a lower limit to the brightness temperature , t@xmath38 @xmath7 10@xmath39 k. the centroid position of the brightest maser feature centered at v@xmath4= 3194 km s@xmath2is marked with a cross in fig .  [ fig2 ] and fig .  [ fig3 ] in which the continuum maps are superposed .",
    "no continuum emission was detected at the maser position at any of our observed frequencies .",
    "the maser spot is located 15.5 mas or 3.6 pc from the unresolved radio continuum peak c1(c ) at 22 ghz , which is coincident with a reference point ( 0 , 0 ) in the 8.4 ghz map in fig .",

    "- a observations with a beam size of 130 @xmath9 80 mas ( 30 @xmath9 18 pc ) in 1997 january , this blueshifted maser emission remained unresolved , and was coincident with the unresolved continuum peak c1(c ) , supporting our vlba results in this paper .",
    "the peak of c2(e ) at 8.4 ghz is about 18 mas , some 4 pc away from the maser spot , suggesting that the maser clusters are located nearly at the midpoint of the line joining c1(c ) and c2(e ) .",
    "+ we found no velocity features of the water maser corresponding to the velocities of the hi and oh absorptions , observed with the vla by gardner et al .",
    "one might ask where the nucleus of ngc5793 lies ? in order to understand the kinematics of the nuclear region in the galaxy we need to address this question .",
    "component c1(c ) shows a flat - spectrum at higher frequencies , at which it is not resolved , suggesting that it might be the true nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the ` true ' nucleus may lie in the continuum emission gap between c1(c ) and c2(e ) where the maser spots are located .",
    "this would mean that the radio continuum nucleus could be highly obscured by a screen of dense ionized gas . in some megamasers like ngc1068 @xcite , the circinus galaxy @xcite , and possibly ngc4945 @xcite ,",
    "the existence of maser disks has been confirmed but continuum emission has not been detected in the vicinity of the water masers .",
    "+ the measured surface brightness of c2(e ) is at least 3.2 @xmath9 10@xmath40 k and could in principle be as high as the @xmath7 10@xmath41 k required for synchrotron self - absorption @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that component c2(e ) was produced by a strong shock with the circumnuclear gas .",
    "a jet ejected from the nucleus could be bent and deflected near c2(e ) and extend further out to component c2(w ) .",
    "alternatively , component c2(e ) could be free - free absorbed by dense ionized foreground gas .",
    "the spectral index of + 0.13 between 1.7 and 5.0 ghz is not steep enough for free - free absorption , but as it is a lower limit , it is not inconsistent with such an hypothesis . if c2(e ) is a free - free absorbed component , it could be the inner part of the disk / torus .",
    "however , at this stage we @xmath42 consider that the spectral turnover of c2(e ) is due to synchrotron self - absorption caused by the collision of a jet from the central engine with a dense gas in the circumnuclear region .",
    "+ there might be a change in flux density during the two observing sessions between oct .",
    "1999 at 1.7 ghz and oct .",
    "1997 at 5.0 ghz .",
    "if so , the determination of the spectral index of c2(e ) is unreliable .",
    "however , the flux density of c2(e ) for 1.7 ghz in nov .",
    "1996 is quite similar with that in oct .",
    "1999 , hence it is less likely that there was significant flux density variation from 1996 to 1999 as for c2(e ) . in any case , there is no straightforward interpretation for the location of the true core . for this reason it is impossible to decide at present whether the water emission in ngc5793 is a nuclear or non - nuclear maser .",
    "interpretation of the geometry of the detected maser emission in ngc5793 is not straightforward , because the blueshifted features are located between continuum peaks and the velocity fields do not show any systematic trends . however , we discuss two possibilities to explain the nature of the maser in the galaxy :    * the water maser in ngc5793 results from the amplification of a radio jet by the circumnuclear molecular gas foreground to the jet . *",
    "the maser lies in a in a compact molecular disk rotating around the galactic nucleus , like that in ngc4258 .",
    "support for the validity of the first model comes from the presence of molecular ( oh ) gas with a parsec - scale distribution seen in absorption against the continuum structure with the vlba @xcite .",
    "the brightness of a putative radio jet component may not be sufficient to be detected by vlbi in ngc5793 at 22  ghz .",
    "the brightness temperature of any undetected 22 ghz continuum source near the maser spots is less than @xmath7 @xmath43 k , assuming that the peak flux density is 6.5 mjy beam@xmath10  ( 5@xmath37 noise level ) .",
    "the beam averaged brightness temperature of the unresolved maser spot is 1.3 @xmath9 10@xmath40 k , so that the maser gain would be a factor of @xmath44 10 .",
    "usually , this situation is seen in oh megamasers functioning as low - gain amplifiers against background continuum sources .",
    "non - nuclear and non - disk masers have been seen in ngc1052 @xcite and ngc1068 @xcite .",
    "the non - nuclear water maser known to exist in ngc1068 , located at 30 pc from the nucleaus along the jet , has not been detected with vlbi , suggesting that the maser spot is resolved or not intense enough for vlbi detection . in ngc1052 two maser spots",
    "are seen lying 0.07 pc from the presumed core along a radio jet ; they show no evidence for disk structure @xcite .",
    "neither of the above cases seems to explain the maser in ngc5793 because it exhibits different characteristics . if the water maser of ngc5793 is emitted from the nuclear region , the large blueshift ( @xmath7 245 km s@xmath2 ) of the maser emission implies that it traces molecular outflows moving at high speed relative to the molecular disk surrounding the nucleus . a model of a non - disk maser",
    "as described here also has problems in explaining the single - dish spectrum of the emission .",
    "+ we now consider the the second possibility , namely that the masers lie in a molecular disk rotating around the nucleus of the galaxy as proposed by hagiwara et al .",
    "unfortunately , during the period of observations the systemic and redshifted features became weaker , and we could not measure the distribution and the velocity structure of the water masers . if we assume the presence of rotating disk , the blueshifted features could arise from the edge of the disk .",
    "the emission has been detectable and does not show any velocity drifts since its discovery in january 1996 .",
    "in addition , the peak flux density is less variable than other features .",
    "such properties are similar to the characteristics of the blue- and redshifted masers in ngc4258 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the peak flux densities of features around the systemic velocity have been particularly variable .",
    "greenhill et al . ( 1995a ) suggested the possibility that the high - velocity features in ngc4258 are visible for substantially longer times than the systemic ones because the emission might be self - amplified in the long gain paths along the edge of the disk .",
    "considering these facts , the high - velocity blueshifted features may trace only a part of the disk , possibly near the tangent points .",
    "with such a supposition in mind , we propose a model ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) for the nuclear region of ngc5793 .",
    "the location of the nucleus is presumed to lie on the midpoint of the axis connecting c1(c ) to c2(e ) .",
    "this axis may mark the location of a two - sided jet .",
    "the blueshifted maser features are offset from this axis by @xmath7 4.5 mas , or 1.0 pc .",
    "the southern side of the rotating disk , where the maser clumps lie , is approaching , while the northern side is receding .",
    "the disk orientation is nearly perpendicular to the jet . in this model ,",
    "the inferred free - free absorbed source c2(e ) lies within the inner radius of the disk .",
    "we estimate that the total mass enclosed within a radius of 1 pc is @xmath7 1 @xmath9 10@xmath0 @xmath1 , assuming a rotation velocity of 240 km s@xmath2and a disk inclination of 73@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the mass density is @xmath46 , a value that is the smallest among the megamasers observed with vlbi @xcite .",
    "the enclosed mass of @xmath7 10@xmath0 @xmath1 is lower approximately by a factor of 10 than that estimated from the oh absorption in the central region of @xmath7 10 pc @xcite , because we adopted a smaller radius .",
    "the sense of the disk rotation is opposite to that of the galactic disk , which has a radius of @xmath7 1 kpc and is observed in co(j = 1  0 ) emission , but is the same as that of the oh absorbing gas disk , implying the existence of an independent kinematical system within the central few parsecs of the circumnuclear region .",
    "+ from recent single - dish measurements made in early 2000 , systemic features lying at v@xmath4= 3430 km s@xmath2to 3520 km s@xmath2were found to be flaring and variable in flux density ( henkel , private communication ) , suggesting that the features might arise against the continuum source at the nucleus along the line of sight , and that the masing cloud is amplifying the background continuum source .",
    "we have observed the water megamasers and continuum emission in the nuclear region of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc5793 with the vlba . because of the faintness of the maser intensities",
    ", only the blueshifted emission could be imaged .",
    "this emission , which is located 3.6 pc southwest of the radio continuum source , is observed to consist of two clusters with a separation of 0.7 mas ( 0.16 pc ) .",
    "no compact continuum emission was detected near to the maser spot .",
    "the detected water maser could be a part of a maser disk as in the case of ngc4258 .",
    "we propose a model in which the masers lie on the southern edge ( approaching side ) of a rotating molecular gas disk whose orientation is nearly perpendicular to the jet . assuming the location of the nucleus at a midpoint between c1 and c2(e )",
    "one can estimate a binding mass on the order of 10@xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , the masers could result from the amplification of a radio jet by foreground circumnuclear gas .",
    "the highly blueshifted velocity of the maser features might mean that the masing cloud traces outflowing gas surrounding an active nucleus .",
    "+ the compact continuum source , c2(e ) appears to have an inverted spectrum between 1.7 and 5.0 ghz , assuming no intrinsic variability , and the spectral turnover might be due to synchrotron self - absorption caused by a shock in the jet owing to collision with the dense gas , or a free - free absorbing screen in a part of an ionized torus / disk .",
    "+ further vlbi observations of the water masers and continuum emission are crucial to clarify the dynamical structures of the maser emission in relation to the active nucleus .",

    "<S> we present the first result of vlbi observations of the blueshifted water maser emission from the type 2 seyfert galaxy ngc5793 , which we combine with new and previous vlbi observations of continuum emission at 1.7 , 5.0 , 8.4 , 15 , and 22 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> maser emission was detected earlier in single - dish observations and found to have both red- and blueshifted features relative to the systemic velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we could image only the blueshifted emission , which is located 3.6 pc southwest of the 22 ghz continuum peak . </S>",
    "<S> the blueshifted emission was found to originate in two clusters that are separated by 0.7 milliarcsecond ( 0.16 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> no compact continuum emission was found within 3.6  pc of the maser spot . a compact continuum source showing a marginally inverted spectrum between 1.7 and 5.0 ghz </S>",
    "<S> was found 4.2 pc southwest of the maser position . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral turnover might be due to synchrotron self - absorption caused by a shock in the jet owing to collision with dense gas , or it might be due to free - free absorption in an ionized screen possibly the inner part of a disk , foreground to the jet </S>",
    "<S> .    the water maser may be part of a maser disk . </S>",
    "<S> if so , it would be rotating in the opposite sense to the highly inclined galactic disk observed in co emission . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a binding mass within 1 pc of the presumed nucleus to be on the order of 10@xmath0 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the maser emission could result from the amplification of a radio jet by foreground circumnuclear molecular gas . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the high blueshift of the maser emission might mean that the masing region is moving outward away from the molecular gas surrounding an active nucleus . </S>"
