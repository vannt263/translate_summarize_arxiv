    "ising model in a transverse field has been widely examined in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics since the pioneering work of de gennes @xcite who introduced it as a pseudo spin model for hydrogen - bonded ferroelectrics such as the @xmath0 type .",
    "following studies has been predicated that this semi - quantum mechanical model can be successfully applied to a variety of physical systems such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite and some real magnetic materials @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", transverse ising model ( tim ) has been investigated by a variety of techniques such as renormalization group method ( rg ) @xcite , effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite , cluster variation method ( cvm ) @xcite , mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite , pair approximation ( pa ) @xcite and monte carlo simulations ( mc ) @xcite . in the previous works mentioned above",
    ", the authors focused their attention on the behavior of tricritical points but have not considered the effect of the crystal field ( i.e. single ion anisotropy ) in hamiltonian describing the system .    however , there are a few studies in the literature that include the crystal field as well as the transverse field interactions .",
    "recently , the effect of both the transverse field and the crystal field on the spin-@xmath3 ising model with spins of magnitude @xmath3=1 have been studied and it is shown that tim model presents a rich variety of critical phenomena .",
    "for example , jiang et al .",
    "@xcite has studied the spin-1 tim on a honeycomb lattice with a longitudinal crystal field and discussed the existence of a tricritical point at which the phase transition change from second - order to first order . by using the eft with a probability distribution technique , htoutou et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the influence of the crystal field on the phase diagrams of a site diluted spin-1 tim on a square lattice .",
    "similarly , jiang have studied a bond diluted spin-1 tim with crystal field interaction for a honeycomb lattice within the framework of the eft with correlations @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the authors have reported the observation of a reentrant behavior on the system .",
    "furthermore , in a series of papers htoutou et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed the dependence of the behavior of the order parameters on the transverse and crystal fields , but they have restricted themselves on the second order transition properties .",
    "the effect of a longitudinal crystal field on the phase transitions in spin-@xmath4 and spin-@xmath5 transverse ising model has been also examined for both honeycomb and square lattices by using the eft with correlations @xcite .",
    "more recently , within the basis of eft and mft , miao et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the phase diagrams of a spin-1 transverse ising model for a honeycomb lattice .",
    "they have obtained the first - order transition lines by comparing the gibbs free energy .",
    "an ordinary eft approximation includes spin - spin correlations resulting from the usage of the van der waerden identities and provides results that are much superior to those obtained within the traditional mft .",
    "however , the eft approximations mentioned above are not sufficient enough to improve the results much",
    ". the reason may be due to the usage of a decoupling approximation that neglects the correlations between different spins that emerge when expanding the identities . according to us , the first - order transition lines obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are incomplete , because the spin correlation functions such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 etc . can not be determined by using any decoupling approximation or in other words , by neglecting the correlations between different spins . in order to overcome this point , we proposed the ieft approximation that takes into account the correlations between different spins in the cluster of considered lattice @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "namely , the hallmark of the ieft is to consider the correlations between different spins that emerge when expanding the identities and this method is superior to conventional mean field theory and the other eft approximations in the literature .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the calculation results will be more accurate .    as far as we know , there is not such a study which includes the longitudinal component of the magnetic field in addition to the crystal field and transverse magnetic field on the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , in the present work , we intended to investigate the thermal and magnetic properties of spin-1 tim with crystal field under a longitudinal magnetic field on a honeycomb lattice within the framework of the ieft .",
    "for this purpose , we investigated the proper phase diagrams , especially the first - order transition lines that include reentrant phase transition regions and we improved the results in refs.@xcite .",
    "we gave the numerical results for the behavior of the order parameters when the system undergoes a first or second order transition at a finite temperature .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to see how the thermodynamic properties like entropy @xmath3 which has not been calculated before and helmholtz free energy @xmath9 are effected by the crystal field as well as transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields .",
    "hence , the numerical results are presented and compared with the literature .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ formulation ] , we briefly present the formulations of the ieft .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "as our model we consider a two dimensional lattice which has @xmath10 identical spins arranged .",
    "we define a cluster on the lattice which consists a central spin labeled @xmath11 , and @xmath12 perimeter spins being the nearest - neighbors of the central spin .",
    "the cluster consists of @xmath13 spins being independent from the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor spins are in an effective field produced by the outer spins , which can be determined by the condition that the thermal average of the central spin is equal to that of its nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-1 transverse model with crystal field in a longitudinal magnetic field is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the @xmath17 and @xmath18 components of the spin operator , respectively .",
    "the first summation in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is over the nearest - neighbor pairs of spins and the operator @xmath15 takes the values @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms stand for the exchange interaction , single - ion anisotropy ( i.e. crystal field ) and transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields , respectively .    at first",
    ", we start constructing the mathematical background of our model by using the approximated spin correlation identities introduced by sbarreto , fittipaldi and zeks @xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath18 .    in order to apply the differential operator technique",
    ", we should separate the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) into two parts as @xmath28 . here",
    ", one part denoted by @xmath29 includes all contributions associated with the site @xmath30 , and the other part @xmath31 does not depend on the site @xmath30 . at this point",
    ", one should notice that @xmath29 and @xmath31 do not commute with each other .",
    "we can write @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the local field on the site @xmath30 .",
    "if we use the matrix representations of the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the spin-1 system then we can obtain the matrix form of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) @xmath37 in order to proceed further , we have to diagonalize @xmath32 matrix in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the three eigenvalues are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the eigenvectors @xmath40 of @xmath32 corresponding to the eigenvalues in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) are calculated as follows @xmath41}{\\omega/\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha_{k } ,   \\\\",

    "this number is given by the relation @xmath53 .",
    "as an example for the spin-1 system , @xmath54 which means that we have to introduce the additional parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 resulting from the usage of the van der waerden identity for the spin-1 ising system . with the help of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath58\\right\\rangle\\\\ & & \\times g(x)|_{x=0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath59\\right\\rangle\\\\ & & \\times k(x)|_{x=0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , we get the quadrupolar moments by expanding the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) @xmath60    @xmath61    corresponding to equation ( [ eq12 ] ) @xmath62 @xmath63 details of calculation through ( [ eq8]-[eq19 ] ) can be found in appendix section . with the help of equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) the functions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) can be calculated numerically from the relations @xmath68",
    "@xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 the internal energy @xmath72 per site of the system can be obtained easily from the thermal average of the hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the internal energy is given by @xmath73 where the correlation functions @xmath6",
    ", @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are obtained from equation ( [ eqa7 ] ) . with the use of equation ( [ eq26 ] )",
    ", the specific heat of the system can be numerically determined from the relation @xmath77 the helmholtz free energy of a system is defined as @xmath78 which , according to the third law , can be written in the form @xcite @xmath79 where the integral in the second term is entropy of the system according to the second law .",
    "first , we calculate the internal energy per site from equation ( [ eq26 ] ) .",
    "then with the help of equation ( [ eq27 ] ) we can carry out numerical integration and calculate the entropy and free energy of the system . equations ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) , ( [ eq16 ] ) , ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) are fundamental correlation functions of the system .",
    "when the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) are expanded , the multispin correlation functions can be easily obtained . the simplest approximation , and one of the most frequently adopted is to decouple these equations according to @xmath80 for @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the main difference of the method used in this study from the other approximations in the literature emerges in comparison with any decoupling approximation ( da ) when expanding the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "one advantage of the approximation method proposed by this study is that no uncontrolled decoupling procedure is used for the higher - order correlation functions .    for spin-1 ising system with @xmath82 ,",
    "taking equations ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) , ( [ eq13 ] ) , ( [ eq16 ] ) , ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) as a basis , we derive a set of linear equations of the spin correlation functions which interact in the system . at this point",
    ", we assume that ( i ) the correlations depend only on the distance between the spins , ( ii ) the average values of a central spin and its nearest - neighbor spin ( it is labeled as the perimeter spin ) are equal to each other , and ( iii ) in the matrix representations of spin operator @xmath83 , the spin-1 system has the properties @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the number of the set of linear equations obtained for the spin-1 ising system with @xmath86 reduces to twenty three and the complete set is given in appendix .",
    "if equation ( [ eqa7 ] ) is written in the form of a @xmath87 matrix and solved in terms of the variables @xmath88 $ ] of the linear equations , all of the spin correlation functions can be easily determined as functions of the temperature , effective field , crystal field and longitudinal magnetic field as well as transverse magnetic field which the other studies in the literature do not include . since the thermal average of the central spin is equal to that of its nearest - neighbor spins within the present method then the unknown parameter @xmath52 can be numerically determined by the relation @xmath89    by solving equation ( [ eq25 ] ) numerically at a given fixed set of hamiltonian parameters we obtain the parameter @xmath52",
    ". then we use the numerical values of @xmath52 to obtain the spin correlation functions @xmath90 , @xmath75 ( longitudinal and transverse magnetizations ) , @xmath55 , @xmath91 ( longitudinal and transverse quadrupolar moments ) and so on , which can be found from equation ( [ eqa7 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath92 is always the root of equation ( [ eq25 ] ) corresponding to the disordered state of the system .",
    "the nonzero root of @xmath52 in equation ( [ eq25 ] ) corresponds to the long - range ordered state of the system .",
    "once the spin correlation functions have been evaluated then we can give the numerical results for the thermal and magnetic properties of the system .",
    "[ fig1a ] [ fig1b ] + [ fig1c ] +    in this section , we can examine the ferromagnetic properties of the spin-1 tim with crystal field under an applied longitudinal magnetic field on a honeycomb lattice using the ieft .",
    "for this purpose , we focus our attention on the phase diagrams of the system in @xmath93 and @xmath94 planes and investigate the whole phase diagrams by examining the numerical results for the thermal and magnetic properties . in order to plot the phase diagrams , we assume @xmath95 and the effective field @xmath96 is very small in the vicinity of @xmath97 and solve the set of linear equations in equation ( [ eqa7 ] ) numerically using the self - consistent relation corresponding to equation ( [ eq25 ] ) . in figs .",
    "1a and 1b , we plot the variation of the critical temperature with transverse field @xmath98 and crystal field @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "1a shows the phase diagram in the @xmath93 plane with @xmath100 and for selected values of @xmath99 , namely @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in this figure",
    ", we can call attention to the signs of an interesting behavior known as reentrant phenomena . in other words , when the crystal field strength is positive valued , the type of the transition in the system is invariably second order which is independent from transverse field value . on the other hand ,",
    "if the crystal field value is sufficiently negative then we can expect to see two successive phase transitions .",
    "solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "1a correspond to the second and first order phase transition lines , respectively .",
    "tricritical end points at which first and second order transition points meet are shown as white circles . in our calculations",
    ", we realized that one can observe reentrant behavior in the system for the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "for the values of @xmath105 the transition lines exhibit a bulge which gets smaller as the value of @xmath99 approaches the value of @xmath106 which means that ferromagnetic phase region gets narrower . we have also examined the phase diagram of the present system in @xmath94 plane with @xmath100 and for selected values of @xmath98 such as @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "1b correspond to the second and first order phase transition lines , respectively .",
    "white circles denote tricritical points .",
    "as we can see from this figure , as the value of transverse field @xmath98 increases starting from zero then the value of tricritical point decreases gradually and disappears for @xmath109 .",
    "if the transverse field value is greater than this value then we have only second order transitions in the system .",
    "these results show that the reentrant phenomenon originates from the competition between the crystal field @xmath99 and transverse field @xmath98 .",

    "the effects of the crystal field on the behavior of the order parameters with a selected transverse field value @xmath118 are shown in fig .",

    "if we keep on cooling process then the second order transition at a finite temperature is followed by a first order transition at a lower temperature @xmath125 .",
    "these results show the existence of reentrant phenomena . furthermore",
    ", as the value of crystal field @xmath99 decreases then the second order transition temperature decreases and the first order transition temperature increases . on the left panel in fig .",
    "2b , we see the behavior of the transverse magnetization with temperature for some selected values of crystal field with @xmath100 . for @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "the transverse magnetization @xmath115 curves increase with the increase of the temperature and then show a cusp which increases in height as the value of the crystal field decreases at @xmath122 and decline as the temperature increases .",

    "in contrast to @xmath116 curves in fig .",
    "2 c , the transverse quadrupolar moment @xmath117 curves increases as the temperature increases and change abruptly at the second order transition temperature for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "for the values of crystal field @xmath123 and @xmath102 @xmath117 curves exhibit two maxima corresponding to the first and second order transitions in the system . when we apply a longitudinal magnetic field such as @xmath129 on the system ,",
    "both the first and second order phase transition effects on the order parameters @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are removed .",
    "this phenomenon can be clearly seen from the right hand side panels in figs .",
    "2a-2d .     +   +    next , the transverse field effect on the variation of the order parameters with temperature such as the longitudinal and transverse magnetizations @xmath114 and @xmath115 as well as the longitudinal and transverse quadrupolar moments @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath130 and @xmath100 can be seen on the left panels fig .",
    "dashed lines represent the first order transition solutions . in fig .",
    "3a , we plot the longitudinal component of magnetization for selected values of transverse field @xmath131 and @xmath132 . as we can see on the left panel in fig .",
    "3a , as the transverse field @xmath98 increases , critical temperature value approaches to zero and saturation value of @xmath114 decreases .",
    "hence , we can say that applying transverse field @xmath98 weakens the longitudinal component of magnetization .",
    "this is an expected result .",
    "however , two successive transitions ( i.e. reentrant behavior ) are observed on the longitudinal magnetization @xmath114 for @xmath133 .",
    "it is clear that applied transverse field @xmath98 destructs the first order transition . on the left panel in fig .",
    "3b , we represent the effect of the transverse field @xmath98 on the temperature dependence of @xmath115 .",
    "in contrast to the situation in @xmath114 , transverse field @xmath98 strengthens the transverse component of magnetization .",
    "we note that , at zero transverse field the transverse magnetization @xmath115 is zero for the whole range of temperature . on the left panels in figs . 3c and 3d",

    "furthermore , applying any longitudinal magnetic field such as @xmath129 on the system , both the first and second order phase transitions are destructed .",
    "this behavior is illustrated on the right panels in fig .",
    "3 . hence , on the basis of these results ( see the right panels in figs . 2 and 3 ) we believe that the effects of the transverse field @xmath98 are very different from those of the longitudinal counterpart @xmath134 because the origin of the transverse field is quantum mechanical and can produce quantum effects .     +   +    finally in fig .",
    "4 , we present the numerical results for the temperature dependence of entropy per site and helmholtz free energy of the system .",
    "as far as we know , there is not such a study dealing with the variation of the entropy of the system with the hamiltonian parameters . in figs . 4a and 4c",
    ", we show the effect of the crystal field @xmath99 on the entropy and free energy for @xmath133 and @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath135 and @xmath136 entropy is not important at low temperatures and free energy is equal to ground state energy of the system .",
    "however , as the temperature increases , the system wants to maximize its entropy in order to minimize its free energy and hence entropy becomes important .",
    "furthermore , the entropy of the system is continuous at the critical temperature which means that the type of the transition is second order . on the other hand , for @xmath137 the entropy and free energy curves represented with dashed lines show a discontinuous behavior at low temperatures which indicates a first order transition and it originates from a discontinuous change in the internal energy of the system .",
    "discontinuous behavior of the entropy can be clearly seen in the inset figure in fig .",
    "4a . as the absolute value of the crystal field increases , energy gap in free energy curves ( see fig .",
    "4c ) disappear and ground state energy equals to zero for tricritical crystal field value @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , we see that increasing the absolute value of the crystal field @xmath99 makes the absolute value of free energy decrease and causes the system to be in a considerably disordered state . these remarkable observations are not reported in the literature .",
    "the effect of the transverse field @xmath98 on the temperature dependence of entropy and helmholtz free energy can be seen in figs . 4b and 4d for selected values of @xmath131 and @xmath138 with @xmath130 and @xmath100 . as the transverse field",
    "@xmath98 value increases , critical temperature decreases and the system reaches disordered phase and maximizes its entropy while minimizing its free energy at early stages of temperature scale .",
    "besides , applied transverse field @xmath98 tends to destroy the energy gap in free energy and hence the first order transitions are removed .",
    "one should notice that although we observe the first order transition effects for @xmath133 in free energy ( see fig .",
    "4c ) , this effect is not evident for the entropy ( fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when we select @xmath130 and @xmath100 with @xmath133 , the system is in a disordered state and the internal energy is zero at low temperatures ( i.e. ground state energy ) and its value is not changed until the system undergoes a first order transition .",
    "in this work , we have studied the phase diagrams of the spin-1 transverse ising model with a longitudinal crystal field in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field on a honeycomb lattice within the framework of the ieft approximation that takes into account the correlations between different spins in the cluster of considered lattice .",
    "we have given the proper phase diagrams , especially the first - order transition lines that include reentrant phase transition regions .",
    "both the order parameters ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) and helmholtz free energy @xmath9 and the entropy @xmath3 curves show discontinuous and unstable points of the system and support the predictions in figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "a number of interesting phenomena such as reentrant phenomena have been found in the physical quantities originating from the crystal field as well as the transverse and longitudinal components of the magnetic field .",
    "we have found that one can observe reentrant behavior in the system for the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 and the tricritical points exist for @xmath112 and @xmath103 .",
    "the results show that the reentrant phenomenon originates from the competition between the crystal field @xmath99 and transverse field @xmath98 . besides , applying a transverse field @xmath98 on the system has the tendency to destruct the first order transitions , while the longitudinal counterpart @xmath134 destructs both the first and second order phase transitions .",
