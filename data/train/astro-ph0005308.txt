    "our initial sample ( see fernndez @xcite for more details ) contained 6922 o- and b - type stars ( _ hipparcos internal proposal inca060 _ completed with all the o and b _ survey _ stars ) , of which 5846 belong to the hipparcos _",
    "survey_. the observational data were taken from the following sources :    * astrometric data from the hipparcos catalogue ( esa @xcite ) : positions in equatorial coordinates , parallaxes and proper motions , together with their standard errors and the correlations between them .",
    "given the mean standard error in the trigonometric parallax provided by hipparcos , reliable distances are available only up to 200 - 400 pc . * strmgren photometry from hauck & mermilliod s ( @xcite ) compilation for deriving individual photometric distances and ages .",
    "* radial velocities from grenier s ( @xcite ) compilation plus additional sources .    in the following subsections",
    "we describe the procedure used and the accuracy achieved in the derivation of individual distances , spatial velocities and ages , together with a discussion of the possible observational biases present in the final working samples .      to derive the best distance estimate for each star in the sample , an analysis of individual errors , possible observational biases and systematic differences between distances derived from hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes and photometric absolute magnitudes was performed .",
    "only 3031 stars from our initial sample have complete strmgren photometry ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) in hauck & mermilliod s ( @xcite ) catalogue .",
    "recently , kaltcheva & knude ( @xcite ) found that photometric distances derived from crawford s ( @xcite ) and balona & shobbrook s ( @xcite ) calibrations show good agreement with hipparcos trigonometric distances , and that no dependence on star rotation can be observed .",
    "the comparison of distances derived using crawford s calibration and hipparcos distances for the non - binary stars in our sample with @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.r.fot.trig ] ) shows no systematic trends .",
    "we also verify that the use of another calibration ( balona & shobbrook @xcite ; jakobsen @xcite ) does not alter the kinematic results presented in sect .",
    "[ oort ] . after this analysis , crawford s ( @xcite ) calibration was adopted to derive photometric distances .",
    "a relative error in the photometric distance was computed following lindroos ( @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the spectral type and luminosity class , this error ranges between 14 - 23% .",
    "reliable photometric distances can only be derived for single , non - variable and non - peculiar stars , so no photometric distance was derived for those stars classified as double or multiple in the hipparcos catalogue with a component separation @xmath16 and a magnitude difference between components @xmath17 , for variable stars with a variation in the hipparcos magnitude system @xmath18 and for stars photometrically classified as peculiar ( jordi et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    for those stars for which we could obtain trigonometric and photometric distances",
    ", we used the distance with the smallest relative error .",
    "this procedure was preferred to the derivation of an error - weighted mean of both distance measurements since the latter would only systematically reduce the error for those stars around 150 - 250 pc ( as will be seen in sect .",
    "[ oort ] , this error is used as a weight in the condition equations , so a different weight would be assigned as a function of distance ) . furthermore , negative trigonometric parallax or the bias in the trigonometric distance discussed below  non negligible for stars with large relative error in parallax  could not be controlled .",
    "in the case of stars for which the photometric distance was not available , to avoid bias , the trigonometric distance was only accepted if its relative error was smaller than 25% . if distances are estimated as @xmath19 , a symmetric error law for parallaxes results in a non - symmetric , biased distribution for distances . according to arenou & luri ( @xcite ) , for small relative errors ( @xmath20 25% ) and assuming a gaussian law for the error on the observed parallax , this bias can be approximated by :      being @xmath22 the _ true _ parallax .",
    "individual corrections for the observed parallaxes are not possible because the bias is a function of the _ true _ parallax ( brown et al .",
    "however , an estimation of the effect of this bias in our trigonometric distances may be made considering in eq .",
    "( [ pi.bias ] ) the _ observed _ instead of the _ true _ parallaxes . in fig .",
    "[ fig.bias.r.trig ] we show the relative bias distribution ( @xmath23 ) for the 858 stars in our sample for which we chose the trigonometric distance as the best distance estimate .",
    "this relative bias is always less than 5.5% , and is smaller than 3% for 88% of the stars , thus giving a bias smaller than 5 pc for 82% of the stars .",
    "therefore , given the impossibility of an individual correction of the biases , while recognizing their smallness ( comparing , for instance , with the relative errors in the parallax ) , we may conclude that our assumption of considering directly the trigonometric distance as given by @xmath24 for stars with relative error in parallax smaller than 25% is a good approximation .",
    "our main source of radial velocities was the compilation of grenier ( @xcite ) , who made a complete compendium and revision of the compilations of barbier - brossat ( @xcite ) and duflot et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "priority was given to barbier - brossat , and only stars with a , b or c quality in duflot et al .",
    "were considered . using these sources , 3397 stars from our initial sample",
    "have radial velocity measurements .",
    "we rejected those stars with an individual error in the radial velocity higher than 10 km ( 131 stars , i.e. 3.9% of the stars with radial velocity ) .",
    "binney et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , when working with nearby stars from all spectral types , emphasized that , due to observational programmes , radial velocity availability is higher for high - proper motion stars . in our case ,",
    "specific observational programmes were undertaken in parallel with the hipparcos mission to obtain radial velocity data for _ survey _ early type hipparcos stars .",
    "to evaluate the effects of the observational constraints on our kinematical study , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.bias.vr.mu ] the fraction of stars with known radial velocities ( @xmath25 ) against the total proper motion .",
    "we can see as this fraction is not a flat function of @xmath26 : it decreases for @xmath27 10 mas yr@xmath7 and rises for @xmath28 10 mas yr@xmath7 . to understand this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig.grid.fracvr.pm.r ] @xmath25 is shown against proper motion and distance .",
    "we can see a higher degree of completeness for distant stars . from fig .",
    "[ fig.grid.fracvr.r.v ] we derived a completeness limit of @xmath29 for radial velocities , although nearly all far and faint stars ( @xmath30 1000 pc , so low @xmath26 ) have radial velocity data .",
    "a possible origin for this effect is due to observing programmes devoted to open clusters and associations . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that a kinematical bias is present in our sample and , although its effects on the analysis performed in sect .",
    "[ oort ] are expected to be negligible , they must be evaluated ",
    "see [ appendix2 ]  through numerical simulations .",
    "individual ages were computed from the evolutionary models of bressan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for solar composition following the interpolation algorithm described in asiain et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm considers , as input parameters , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 derived from the strmgren photometric indices ( moon et al .",
    "@xcite ; napiwotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the weakness in this procedure lies in the inability to take into account the effects of stellar rotation when deriving ages from photometry .",
    "figueras & blasi ( @xcite ) , analysing a sample of main sequence b7-a4 stars , found that actual photometric ages increment by 30 - 50% in average , if rotation is not considered .",
    "as individual corrections are not possible , and an important fraction of the o - b9 main - sequence stars are high rotators , this important systematic trend has to be considered when deriving an age for the gould belt system .",
    "first , individual ages were derived for all the stars for which photometric data was available , without taking into account binarity , variability or photometric peculiarities .",
    "the age and relative error in age distributions computed for 2864 stars are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.edat.hist ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.error.edat.hist ] , respectively . with the aim of retaining as many as possible of the very young stars in our final sample ,",
    "a careful treatment was followed to take into account the effects of binarity , duplicity or peculiarity in the age computation :    * in the case of double or multiple stars for which only joint photometry is available ( i.e. , systems with @xmath16 and @xmath33 ) , the computed age is greater than the real age ( trimble & ostriker @xcite ) .",
    "all double or multiple systems with computed ages smaller than 30 myr have an actual age inside the interval @xmath34 30 myr , so they were retained in the working sample only if they have a reliable hipparcos trigonometric parallax ( @xmath35 ) , as the effects of duplicity render the photometric distance meaningless .",
    "furthermore , roughly 80% of these stars have @xmath36 60 myr , so there is a high probability that they belong to the gould belt .",
    "double or multiple systems with an estimated age larger than 30 myr were rejected . *",
    "we rejected those stars with photometric or spectral peculiarities .",
    "the photometric indices accounting for temperature for bp stars are bluer due to peculiarities , thus producing estimated ages smaller than real ( hauck @xcite ) .",
    "variable stars with @xmath37 were also rejected . * as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.error.edat.hist ] , about 12% of the sample has a relative error in age larger than 100% . from them ,",
    "those placed below the zams ( 206 stars ) are peculiar stars that are already rejected or very young stars .",
    "we checked that the stars above the zams had a computed age smaller than about 30 myr ( 116 stars ) . in any case , as these stars are expected to be very young and therefore of great importance to our study of the gould belt ( they represent roughly 25% of the stars with @xmath38 30 myr ) , we decided to retain them in the final sample ."
