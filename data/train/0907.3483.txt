    "jet production in @xmath0 collisions at hera provides an important testing ground for perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , as well as giving direct access to the strong coupling constant , @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , hera jet measurements are sensitive to the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton .    at hera , there are broadly two kinematic regimes : deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , where the virtuality of the exchanged boson is large ( @xmath4 @xmath2 ) , and photoproduction ( @xmath5 ) , which proceeds via the exchange of a quasi - real photon ( @xmath6 ) . in this contribution ,",
    "recent measurements of inclusive - jet @xcite and dijet @xcite production in neutral current ( nc ) dis are presented .",
    "the data used in these measurements correspond to more than a two - fold increase in statistics compared to previous studies .",
    "the measurements are sensitive to the parton content of the proton , especially the gluon density at high momentum fractions , and may serve as valuable inputs to future qcd fits for the pdfs .",
    "in addition to the jet cross section measurements , two new determinations of @xmath3 are presented : the first is extracted from the nc dis inclusive - jet measurement @xcite presented here , and the second is derived from a re - analysis @xcite of previously published data @xcite on inclusive jets in @xmath5 .",
    "the data used for the jet cross section measurements were collected with the zeus detector at hera . for the inclusive - jet analysis ,",
    "the data are from the @xmath7 running period and correspond to @xmath8 . for the dijet case , the data are from @xmath9 and @xmath10 running , combined , corresponding to a total of @xmath11 . during these times , hera operated with protons of energy @xmath12 gev and electrons of energy @xmath13 gev .",
    "the phase space of the measurements is restricted to the region @xmath14 @xmath2 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the polar angle of the hadronic system is the angle of the scattered quark . ]",
    ". for the dijet case , a further requirement of @xmath17 @xmath2 was imposed : this restricts the data to a region where the contribution from @xmath18 exchange is negligible .",
    "jets were reconstructed in the breit ( and higher ) ; in the born level process ( @xmath19 ) , the virtual boson @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) is absorbed by the struck quark , which is back - scattered with zero transverse momentum with respect to the @xmath20 direction . at leading order in @xmath3 , the boson - gluon - fusion ( @xmath22 ) and qcd compton ( @xmath23 )",
    "processes give rise to two hard jets with opposite transverse momenta .",
    "] frame @xcite , using the longitudinally invariant @xmath24-clustering algorithm @xcite in the inclusive mode @xcite , and were required to lie in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath25 . for the inclusive - jet analysis",
    ", events were selected if they contained at least one jet with @xmath26 gev .",
    "for the dijet case , at least two jets were required with @xmath27 gev : the asymmetric cut is made in order to avoid infra - red sensitive regions where the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd programs are not reliable .",
    "the data were corrected for detector efficiency and acceptance effects using the ariadne @xcite and lepto @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) models .",
    "the mc programs were also used to correct the measured cross sections for qed radiative effects and the running of @xmath28 .",
    "the typical statistical precision on the final cross section measurements is @xmath29 .",
    "the dominant experimental systematic comes from the uncertainty on the jet energy scale ( known to @xmath30 for @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 for higher jet - transverse - energies ) , leading to effects on the cross sections of typically @xmath33 .",
    "the second - most - important is the model uncertainty arising from using ariadne versus lepto to correct for detector effects ( this leads to uncertainties of typically @xmath34 on the cross sections ) .",
    "the nlo qcd ( @xmath35 ) calculations used to compare with the data were obtained using the program disent @xcite .",
    "the factorisation scale was taken to be @xmath36 and the renormalisation scale was taken to be @xmath37 ( of each jet ) for the inclusive - jet measurement and @xmath38 for the dijet case , where @xmath39 is the average transverse energy of the two jets .",
    "the strong coupling was calculated at two loops using @xmath40 mev , corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "the calculations were performed using the zeus - s @xcite proton pdf for the inclusive - jet and cteq6 @xcite for the dijet measurement . in order to compare directly with the data ,",
    "the nlo qcd predictions were corrected for hadronisation using the average of the corrections obtained from ariadne and lepto .",
    "the inclusive - jet predictions were also corrected for @xmath18 exchange .",
    "several sources of theoretical uncertainty were considered : uncertainties due to neglected terms beyond nlo in the perturbative expansion ; uncertainties from the input proton pdfs ; uncertainties from @xmath3 ; hadronisation correction uncertainties ; and those due to the choice of factorisation scale .",
    "the dominant theoretical uncertainty is due to the contribution from terms beyond nlo , which was estimated by varying the renormalisation scale by the ( conventional ) factors of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this resulted in variations in the predicted cross section of @xmath44 .",
    "all other sources typically resulted in only small changes to the predicted cross sections .",
    "the inclusive - jet cross sections were measured differentially as functions of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ fig : inclusive ] shows the single differential cross section as a function of @xmath45 : the inner and outer error bars show the statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties respectively ; the shaded band indicates the bin - by - bin correlated systematic uncertainty due to the jet energy scale ; and the hashed area gives the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the results show that the data are well described by nlo qcd over the measured range . except at the very highest @xmath45 values ,",
    "the theoretical uncertainties dominate over the experimental .",
    "double differential cross sections as a function of @xmath46 , in @xmath48 bins of @xmath45 , were also measured .",
    "previously , a similar measurement of inclusive jets in nc dis @xcite was included in a nlo qcd fit @xcite performed by the zeus collaboration .",
    "the results showed that the hera jet data were able to significantly constrain the gluon pdf at mid - to - high values of the proton momentum fraction .",
    "the new measurement presented here is in the same region of phase space but corresponds to @xmath49 times the statistics .",
    "the very high experimental precision makes it a promising candidate for inclusion in future qcd analyses , potentially providing substantial further constraints on the gluon density in the proton .     in regions of @xmath45 from zeus",
    "@xcite.[fig : dijet],width=321,height=321 ]     in regions of @xmath45 from zeus  @xcite.[fig : dijet],height=340 ]    the dijet cross sections were measured differentially as functions of a number of kinematic and jet observables , including @xmath45 , @xmath50 ( the dijet invariant mass ) , @xmath39 and @xmath51 is the parton momentum fraction , where @xmath52 is the bjorken-@xmath53 variable . ] .",
    "the data are generally well described by the predictions of nlo qcd .",
    "double differential cross sections as a function of @xmath51 , in @xmath54 regions of @xmath45 , were also measured ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dijet ] ) .",
    "the data are reasonably well described by nlo qcd , although there is some sensitivity to the choice of renormalisation scale . at large @xmath45 ,",
    "the statistical uncertainties dominate .",
    "the contribution of gluon - induced events to the total cross section was also estimated as a function of @xmath45 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is observed that the contribution from gluon - induced processes is at least @xmath56 , even for high values of @xmath45 ( @xmath57 @xmath2 ) and @xmath55 .",
    "the uncertainties on the predicted cross sections , arising from the gluon pdf , are found to be substantial .",
    "therefore , these data are also expected to provide potentially strong constraints on the gluon content of the proton .",
    "an nlo qcd analysis was performed on the single - differential nc dis inclusive - jet cross section as a function of @xmath45 in order to determine a value of @xmath58 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : inclusive ] ) .",
    "only the region @xmath59 @xmath2 was used , giving the best overall uncertainty on the extracted value .",
    "the qcd calculations were performed using the program disent ( as described in sec .  [ sec : nlo ] ) , using @xmath54 different sets of pdfs from the zeus - s fit , each with different values of @xmath58 .",
    "the value of @xmath58 used in each cross section calculation was that associated with the pdf used .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the predicted cross sections , in each @xmath45 bin , was parameterised using a function quadratic in @xmath58 .",
    "the value obtained is : @xmath60 , corresponding to a total uncertainty of @xmath61 .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are dominated by the contribution from the jet energy scale ( @xmath62 ) while the theoretical uncertainties are dominated by terms beyond nlo ( @xmath63 ) , as evaluated using the method of jones et al . @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties from other sources ( proton pdfs , hadronisation corrections and @xmath64 ) are generally small .",
    "a similar method was employed to extract a new value of @xmath58 from a previously published measurement of inclusive - jets in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the single differential inclusive - jet cross section as a function of @xmath65 was used for the determination .",
    "the nlo qcd calculations were performed using the program of klasen , kleinwort and kramer @xcite .",
    "the factorisation and renormalisation scales were taken to be @xmath66 and the photon pdf was grv - ho @xcite .",
    "with respect to the original publication , the input proton pdf was updated to mrst01 @xcite ( c.f .",
    "mrst99 ) and the method of jones et al .",
    "@xcite was used to evaluate the uncertainties from terms beyond nlo .",
    "the value of @xmath58 extracted is : @xmath67 , corresponding to a @xmath68 total uncertainty .",
    "the central value is almost identical to that obtained in the original publication using the same data .",
    "the dominant experimental uncertainty arises from the jet energy scale ( @xmath69 ) and the theoretical uncertainty is again dominated by terms beyond nlo ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "both measurements are in agreement with other determinations from hera , and with the world average , and are of competitive precision .",
    "nnlo calculations will be needed to further improve the theoretical uncertainties in the future .",
    "inclusive - jet and dijet cross sections have been measured in nc dis at hera , for @xmath1 @xmath2 , using more than a two - fold increase in statistics compared to previous studies .",
    "the measurements are well described by the predictions of nlo qcd and are sensitive to the proton pdfs , especially the gluon density at high momentum fractions .",
    "the measurements are therefore natural candidates for inclusion in future qcd fits for the proton pdfs .    in addition",
    ", a value of @xmath58 has been extracted from the nc dis inclusive - jet single - differential cross section as a function of @xmath45 ( for @xmath59 @xmath2 ) .",
    "a further determination has been obtained from a re - analysis of previously published data on inclusive - jet @xmath5 .",
