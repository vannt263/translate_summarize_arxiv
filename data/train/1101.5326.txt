    "the recent observation in astrophysics and cosmology clearly indicates dark matter constitutes 23% of total energy in the present universe . the combined analysis , including galaxy rotation curves",
    ", gravitational lensing , cosmic microwave background and structure formation , shows that dark matter is non - baryonic , weakly interacting and cold .",
    "it therefore demands to go beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics to accommodate dark matter .",
    "certain viable models beyond the sm involve scenarios of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , so - called technicolor ( tc )  @xcite , in which the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically without a fundamental higgs , by the nonperturbative condensate of techni - fermion and anti - techni - fermion , @xmath0 , triggered by the new gauge interaction .",
    "the electroweak precision data and the absence of flavor changing neutral currents constrain properties of the tc gauge dynamics  @xcite to be almost conformal or scale - invariant ( walking )  @xcite , characterized by a large anomalous dimension ( @xmath1 ) of techni - fermion bilinear @xmath2 .",
    "the tc gauge coupling ( @xmath3 ) then has an almost nonrunnning / conformal behavior between the techni - fermion mass scale @xmath4 at infrared ( ir ) and the intrinsic scale of walking tc at ultraviolet ( uv ) , @xmath5 , which is usually identified with extended tc ( etc ) scale  @xcite , @xmath6 , but not in our proposal .",
    "the almost conformal property implies existence of the approximate scale invariance , whose spontaneous breaking then leads to generation of ( almost ) massless dilaton . in walking tc the ( approximate ) scale symmetry",
    "is broken by the nonperturbative generation of techni - fermion mass @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamical generation of @xmath7 is characterized by essential singularity scaling , what is called miransky scaling  @xcite tied with the conformal phase transition  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the critical coupling for the chiral symmetry breaking and @xmath10 is the gauge coupling measured at @xmath7 . by the goldstone theorem , therefore , dilaton , the nambu - goldstone boson for the spontaneously broken scale symmetry , emerges in walking tc  @xcite .",
    "actually , the  fixed \" coupling @xmath11 becomes dependent of @xmath12 and starts  running \" according to eq.([miransky ] ) , to break the scale symmetry _ explicitly _ : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dilatation current composed of tc sector fields and @xmath15 is the field strength tensor of techni - gluons .",
    "thus the nonperturbative generation of techni - fermion mass _ explicitly _ ( as well as spontaneously ) breaks the scale symmetry due to the nonperturbative running ( walking ) given by miransky scaling , eq.([miransky ] ) .",
    "the dilaton therefore becomes massive ( pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ) by this ",
    "nonperturbative - explicit breaking effect \" , which was long ago predicted in walking tc as a techni - dilaton ( td )  @xcite .",
    "thereby , _ the td mass @xmath16 and the coupling , set by the decay constant @xmath17 , are associated to the nonperturbative beta function @xmath18_. this can be easily seen if we assume the partially conserved dilatation currents ( pcdcs ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the vacuum energy density governed by the techni - gluon condensation triggered by the nonperturbative generation of @xmath7 .    the nonperturbative beta function @xmath18 in eq.([npbeta ] ) describes the running ( walking ) for a wide range from the ( uv ) intrinsic scale @xmath5 to the ( ir ) techni - fermion mass scale @xmath7 , which can be _ extremely hierarchical _ ,",
    "say , @xmath21 due to the essential singularity scaling eq.([miransky ] ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 and the theory is _",
    "extremely walking_. on the other hand , if @xmath24 , one would have @xmath25 , close to @xmath26 . though the precise value of @xmath11 is determined dynamically , it lies parametrically between @xmath9 and @xmath27 , the quasi ir fixed point of walking tc  @xcite .",
    "thus the _ extremely walking _ theory which yields the _ extreme _ scale hierarchy @xmath28 can be realized if @xmath9 and @xmath27 are very close to each other .    since the td mass @xmath16 and decay constant @xmath17 couple directly with @xmath18 ( via the nonperturbative scale anomaly eq.([pcdc : original ] ) ) and hence originate from either the uv scale ( @xmath5 )   at which @xmath29 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "but , we do not differentiate these two uv scales here , because there is no large hierarchy between them  @xcite . ] or the ir scale ( @xmath7 ) , they could be of the same order , or even _ extremely hierarchical _ as well as @xmath5 and @xmath7 . however , recall that the td should be lighter than other tc hadrons like techni - rho meson ( with mass of order of a few tev ) because of the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson s nature",
    ". the scale of @xmath16 should therefore be set by the ir scale , @xmath7 , which leaves us only two possibilities that i ) @xmath30 or ii ) @xmath31 .",
    "several attempts to calculate @xmath16 have so far been performed in a different context based on straightforward nonperturbative calculations with some approximations assumed  @xcite .",
    "those results suggest that @xmath30 near the criticality of walking tc ( @xmath32 ) and hence favor the case i ) . on the other hand",
    ", a recent holographic analysis  @xcite implies that @xmath33 near the criticality , which supports the case ii ) .",
    "thus the hierarchy between @xmath16 and @xmath7 is still controversial at present , so one can not exclude either the case i ) or the case ii ) above .    as for the td decay constant @xmath17 , no explicit estimate based on nonperturbative analysis has been carried out . recently , however , one implication from holography  @xcite has been given to suggest that @xmath34 near the criticality , so one expects @xmath35 from the nonperturbative scale anomaly ( eqs.([npbeta])-([pcdc : original ] ) ) .",
    "the presence of such an extremely large @xmath17 might be reasonable from a point of view of the naive dimensional analysis  @xcite since @xmath36 when one considers  la chiral lagrangian describing the dilaton dynamics , analogously to qcd pions .",
    "indeed , it turns out that the pcdc relation eq.([pcdc : original ] ) allows the _ extremely hierarchical _ scales between @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath37 which can be clarified as follows .",
    "the estimate of the vacuum energy density @xmath20 in eq.([pcdc : original ] ) has been performed with some assumptions  @xcite or approximations  @xcite independently of calculation of @xmath16 . in an _ extremely walking _ case such as when @xmath28 the nonrunning approximation for the tc gauge coupling ( what is called standing limit ) is sufficient for evaluating the vacuum energy .",
    "we then have @xmath38  @xcite and hence @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively stand for the number of tc and that of techni - fermions",
    ". thus the pcdc eq.([pcdc ] ) is consistent with the _ extremely hierarchical _",
    "scenario eq.([decoupledtd ] ) .    since the walking tc yields @xmath1 for the techni - fermion bilinear operator @xmath2 , the induced four - fermi operator @xmath42 having @xmath43 becomes marginal as well as the tc gauge coupling @xmath3 in the sense of renormalization group analysis .",
    "the form of scale anomaly eq.([npbeta ] ) , hence the pcdc relation in eqs.([pcdc : original ] ) and ( [ pcdc ] ) , should then be modified by the presence of the four - fermi interaction",
    ". one might therefore think that our observation based on eq.([pcdc ] ) would then make no sense .",
    "actually , such four - fermi effects have been intensively studied through the analysis on the planar qed with nonrunning gauge coupling and four - fermion interactions added ( what is called gauged nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model )  @xcite . particularly in refs .",
    "@xcite , the vacuum energy density @xmath20 was explicitly computed in the gauged njl model with the nonrunning gauge coupling , so that the result essentially remains the same as in eq.([pcdc ] ) , @xmath44 .",
    "thus our observation above will be unaffected even in the presence of the marginal four - fermi operator   as that in eq.([pcdc ] )  @xcite within a 5% uncertaity .",
    "this reflects the fact that the mass and coupling of td are tied to the nonperturbative scale anomaly ( [ npbeta ] ) which has nothing to do with how the theory is perturbatively ( fully or almost ) scale invariant , as long as the dynamical fermion mass is generated in accord with  la miransky scaling ( [ miransky ] ) . ] .",
    "it is worth exploring what would happen if the _ extremely hierarchical _ scenario eq.([decoupledtd ] ) could be realized  ) is of course not excluded by eq.([pcdc ] ) , which would be relevant to the td lhc physics  @xcite . ] . in that case",
    ", the td could become almost massless ( @xmath45 ) with the extremely large decay constant @xmath17 ( @xmath46 . the td interactions with other particles are then highly suppressed by the @xmath47 , which would make the td decoupled from the thermal background in the early universe . such a td can therefore be a dark matter candidate , that we shall call a _ light decoupled td_.    in this paper we propose the light decoupled td as a new candidate for dark matter which arises from _ extreme walking _ tc with @xmath48   gev below the intrinsic scale @xmath5 . ] .",
    "it has actually been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite without explicit estimate that the decoupled td might be a candidate for dark matter . in the following",
    "we show that the light decoupled td can certainly be a new candidate for the dark matter by explicitly estimating the lifetime and relic abundance , consistently with cosmological and astrophysical constraints .",
    "we describe here all the essential features of td as dark matter in a self - contained manner , though some of the detailed calculations are deferred to a forthcoming longer version , which deals with other issues as well  @xcite .",
    "the td decays into two photons through the scale anomaly involving techni - fermions ( @xmath49 ) and sm fermions ( @xmath50 ) in the loop . for the light",
    "decoupled td case with @xmath51 , the decay rate @xmath52 is given as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the fine structure constant and @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is the electromagnetic charge of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( or 1 ) for @xmath59 ( or @xmath50 ) while @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) for fermions belonging to fundamental representation ( or singlet ) of the qcd color . for the sm alone , we have @xmath62 and one - family tc with @xmath63 and @xmath64 gives @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 .",
    "using eq .",

    "] , for the one - family tc model with @xmath73 gev .",
    "this constraint also gives a lower bound on the td decay constant through eq.([pcdc ] ) , @xmath74 , which indeed implies the decoupled td .",
    "recall that , as noted above , the extremely large @xmath17 is possible in the _ extremely walking _ case when @xmath75 which is realized by the nonperturbative beta function eq.([npbeta ] ) coupling the td to the nonperturbative scale anomaly eq.([pcdc : original ] ) .",
    "the td will be generated at the same time or right after the techni - fermion condensate takes place at the temperature @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfies @xmath79 . as noted above , in addition , due to the miransky scaling eq.([miransky ] )",
    ", the dynamical mass @xmath7 should be much smaller than the other two scales , so that @xmath80 and @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "this hierarchical structure has actually been confirmed  @xcite by an explicit calculation in the walking tc , which predicts @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the case with an _ extremely large scale hierarchy_. we thus see that , due to the large decay constant @xmath85 gev , the td decouples ( with the decoupling temperature @xmath86 gev ) from the thermal equilibrium as soon as it is produced at @xmath87 .",
    "we will take @xmath88 , @xmath89 gev and @xmath90 as the reference values inspired by the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "though the td decouples from the thermal equilibrium right after its generation , it could be produced through scatterings of particles which are in the thermal equilibrium at @xmath91 .",
    "those thermal particles are assumed to include techni - hadrons and techni - fermions with masses of @xmath92 as well as the sm particles .",
    "the most dominant contribution is expected to come from the processes including qcd interactions with the relatively large qcd coupling @xmath93 . among the qcd processes ,",
    "the leading contributions arise from those having single td in the final state with the suppression factor of @xmath94 .",
    "such processes turn out to be @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote the sm(techni- ) quark , gluon , and colored - techni - pion , respectively .",
    "since the td production itself accompanies breaking of the dilatation / scale symmetry , those processes should involve the anomalous vertex breaking the dilatation symmetry coupled to the qcd gluon field strength @xmath15 , @xmath104 $ ] . at non - trivial leading order of @xmath105 , the form of those cross sections",
    "then goes like @xmath106 .",
    "plugging those cross sections into the boltzmann equation , we can estimate the relic abundance of td , @xmath107 , the ratio of the number density of td to the entropy density . the backreaction is safely neglected since the td number density is much smaller than the photon number density in the thermal equilibrium . using the boundary condition",
    "@xmath108 , we then find the relic abundance at present @xmath109 , @xmath110 for the tc one - family model .",
    "this leads to the thermally produced relic density of td , @xmath111 which is , with _ a priori _ consistency with some astrophysical constraints taken into account , much smaller than the observed dark matter density @xmath112 .",
    "analogously to the case of axion dark matter  @xcite , the population of td could be accumulated by  misalignment \" of the classical td field @xmath113 with the scaling dimension @xmath114 . below @xmath76 ,",

    "examining the dynamics at the classical level based on the potential eq.([vtd ] ) as well as the scale invariant kinetic term , it turns out  @xcite that the @xmath113 starts oscillating with the initial position of the order of @xmath17 as soon as the td mass @xmath16 becomes comparable with the hubble parameter @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
