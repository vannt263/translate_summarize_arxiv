    "to characterize the numbers that arise as the face numbers of simplicial complexes of various types is a problem that has intrigued many researchers over the last half century and has been solved for quite a few classes of complexes , among them the class of all simplicial complexes @xcite as well as the class of all simplicial polytopes @xcite .",
    "one of the precursors of the latter result was the upper bound theorem ( ubt , for short ) @xcite that provided sharp upper bounds on the face numbers of _ all _ @xmath2-dimensional polytopes with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "while the ubt is a classic by now , the situation for centrally symmetric polytopes is wide open .",
    "for instance , the largest number of edges , @xmath9 , that a @xmath2-dimensional centrally symmetric polytope on @xmath0 vertices can have is unknown even for @xmath10 and no even conjectural bounds on this number exist . in this paper , we establish certain bounds on @xmath11 and , more generally , on @xmath12 , the maximum number of @xmath4-dimensional faces of a centrally symmetric @xmath2-dimensional polytope with @xmath0 vertices . for every even dimension",
    "@xmath2 we construct a centrally symmetric polytope with @xmath0 vertices , which , we conjecture , provides asymptotically the largest number of faces in every dimension as @xmath0 grows and @xmath2 is fixed among all @xmath2-dimensional centrally symmetric polytopes with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "let us recall the basic definitions .",
    "a polytope will always mean a convex polytope ( that is , the convex hull of finitely many points ) , and a @xmath2-polytope  a @xmath2-dimensional polytope .",
    "a polytope @xmath13 is _ centrally symmetric _",
    "( cs , for short ) if for every @xmath14 , @xmath15 belongs to @xmath16 as well , that is , @xmath17 .",
    "the number of @xmath18-dimensional faces ( @xmath18-faces , for short ) of @xmath16 is denoted @xmath19 and is called the _ @xmath18th face number _ of @xmath16",
    ".    the ubt proposed by motzkin in 1957 @xcite and proved by mcmullen @xcite asserts that among all @xmath2-polytopes with @xmath0 vertices , the cyclic polytope , @xmath20 , maximizes the number of @xmath18-faces for every @xmath18 . here",
    "the _ cyclic polytope _ ,",
    "@xmath20 , is the convex hull of @xmath0 distinct points on the _ moment curve _",
    "@xmath21 or on the _ trigonometric moment curve _ @xmath22 ( assuming @xmath1 ) .",
    "both types of cyclic polytopes were investigated by carathodory @xcite and later by gale @xcite who , in particular , showed that the two types are combinatorially equivalent ( for even @xmath2 ) and independent of the choice of points .",
    "cyclic polytopes were also rediscovered by motzkin @xcite and many others .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite and @xcite for more information on these amazing polytopes .    here",
    "we define and study a natural centrally symmetric analog of cyclic polytopes  bicyclic polytopes .",
    "let us consider the curve @xmath23 which we call the _",
    "symmetric moment curve _ ,",
    "the difference between @xmath25 and the trigonometric moment curve is that we employ only odd multiples of @xmath26 in the former .",
    "clearly , @xmath27 , so @xmath25 defines a map @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to identify the quotient @xmath29 with the unit circle @xmath30 via the map @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , @xmath26 and @xmath32 form a pair of antipodal points in @xmath33 .",
    "we observe that @xmath34 so the symmetric moment curve @xmath35 is centrally symmetric about the origin .",
    "let @xmath36 be a finite set .",
    "a _ bicyclic _",
    "@xmath37-dimensional polytope , @xmath38 , is the convex hull of the points @xmath39 , @xmath40 : @xmath41 we note that @xmath38 is a centrally symmetric polytope as long as one chooses @xmath42 to be a centrally symmetric subset of @xmath33 . in the case of @xmath43",
    "these polytopes were introduced and studied ( among certain more general 4-dimensional polytopes ) by smilansky @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge the higher - dimensional bicyclic polytopes have not yet been investigated . also , in @xcite smilansky studied the convex hull of @xmath44 ( among convex hulls of certain more general 4-dimensional curves ) but the convex hull of higher dimensional symmetric moment curves has not been studied either .",
    "we recall that a _ face _ of a convex body is the intersection of the body with a supporting hyperplane .",
    "faces of dimension 0 are called _ vertices _ and faces of dimension 1 are called _",
    "edges_. our first main result concerns the edges of the convex hull @xmath45 of the symmetric moment curve .",

    "now if @xmath16 is a centrally symmetric polytope on @xmath0 vertices then no two of its antipodal vertices are connected by an edge , and so @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , as was recently shown by linial and the second author @xcite , this inequality is strict as long as @xmath73 .",
    "this leads one to wonder how big the gap between @xmath9 and @xmath74 is and whether @xmath62 , for @xmath71 , is on the order of @xmath75 .",
    "theorems [ main - thm1 ] and [ main - thm2 ] ( see also propositions [ ub1 ] and [ ub2 ] below ) provide ( partial ) answers to those questions .",
    "let us fix an even dimension @xmath1 and let @xmath76 be a set of @xmath0 equally spaced points , where @xmath0 is an even number .",
    "we conjecture that for every integer @xmath77 @xmath78    it is also worth mentioning that recently there has been a lot of interest in the problems surrounding neighborliness and face numbers of cs polytopes in connection to statistics and error - correcting codes , see @xcite . in particular , it was proved in @xcite that for large @xmath0 and @xmath2 , if @xmath4 is bigger than a certain threshold value , then the ratio between the expected number of @xmath4-faces of a random cs @xmath2-polytope with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath79 is smaller than @xmath80 for some positive constant @xmath81 .",
    "the upper bound part of theorem  [ main - thm2 ] provides a real reason for this phenomenon : the expected number of @xmath4-faces is `` small '' because the @xmath4th face number of _ every _ cs polytope is  small \" .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we prove the upper bound parts of theorems [ main - thm1 ] and [ main - thm2 ] . in section 3",
    "we discuss bicyclic polytopes and their relationship to non - negative trigonometric polynomials and self - inversive polynomials .",
    "section 4 contains new short proofs of results originally due to smilansky on the faces of 4-dimensional bicyclic polytopes .",
    "it serves as a warm - up for sections 5 and 6 in which we prove theorems [ lower1 ] and [ facegen ] as well as the lower bound parts of theorems [ main - thm1 ] and [ main - thm2 ] .",
    "we discuss 2-faces of @xmath82 as well as @xmath83 for @xmath84 in section 7 , where we also state several open questions .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove the upper bound parts of theorems [ main - thm1 ] and [ main - thm2 ] .",
    "the proof uses a volume trick similar to the one utilized in the proof of the danzer - grnbaum theorem on the number of vertices of antipodal polytopes @xcite and more recently in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) , where it was used to estimate maximal possible neighborliness of cs polytopes .",
    "the upper bound part of theorem [ main - thm1 ] is an immediate consequence of the following more precise result .",
    "[ ub1 ] let @xmath13 be a cs @xmath2-polytope on @xmath0 vertices .",

    "since @xmath16 is centrally symmetric , and @xmath96 , the point @xmath99 is an interior point of @xmath16 . as @xmath100 is also the barycenter of the line segment connecting @xmath87 and @xmath91",

    "the first result is an adaptation of the well - known perturbation argument , see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) , to the centrally symmetric situation .",
    "namely , we claim that for every cs @xmath2-polytope @xmath16 there exists a simplicial cs @xmath2-polytope @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and @xmath119 for all @xmath120 .",
    "the polytope @xmath117 is obtained from @xmath16 by pulling the vertices of @xmath16 in a generic way but so as to preserve the symmetry .",
    "the proof is completely similar to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) and hence is omitted .    the second result states that for any @xmath121-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath122 with @xmath0 vertices , we have @xmath123 the standard double - counting argument goes as follows : every @xmath4-dimensional simplex of @xmath122 contains exactly @xmath124 edges and every edge of @xmath122 is contained in at most @xmath125 of the @xmath4-dimensional simplices of @xmath122 .",
    "hence @xmath126    the statement now follows by proposition [ ub1 ] .",
