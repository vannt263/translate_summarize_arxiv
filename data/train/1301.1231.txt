    "the idea of the noncommutative quantum field theory originates from 1940 s when it was applied to cure the divergencies in quantum field theory before the renormalization approach was born @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was demonstrated that the divergencies were not removed @xcite .",
    "later on , it was shown in @xcite that the noncommutative quantum field theory describes effectively the low energy limit of the string theory on a noncommutative manifold . in the simplest case ,",
    "the description of the noncommutative space - time is given by a constant parameter , @xmath1 , that its space - space ( -time ) components correspond to the magnetic ( electric ) field .",
    "the space - time noncommutative field theories suffer from the unitarity violation of the s - matrix @xcite while the space - space noncommutative field theories face another obstacle , mixing of ultraviolet and infrared singularities @xcite .",
    "the problem of the non - unitary s - matrix was studied in @xcite but includes some inconsistencies .",
    "+ in fact , space - time noncommutativity leads to the higher orders of time derivatives of the fields in the lagrangian which make the quantization procedure of the theory different from that of the commutative counterpart .",
    "for example in @xcite , the perturbative quantization of the noncommutative qed in 1 + 1 dimensions has been analyzed up to @xmath2 .    in the present work , the noncommutative two dimensional qed with massless fermions in euclidean space @xmath3",
    "is considered .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to concentrate on the mass spectrum of the theory at higher loops .",
    "the commutative counterpart of this model , schwinger model , was studied in @xcite where it was shown that the photon in two dimensions acquires dynamical mass , arising from the loop effect , without gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the mass spectrum of the schwinger model contains a free boson with a mass proportional to the dimensionful coupling constant .",
    "fermions disappear from the physical states due to the linearity of the potential that is similar to the quark confinement potential in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "hence , schwinger model can be a toy model to understand the quark confinement .",
    "+ the extension of the schwinger model to the noncommutative version from different aspects has been addressed in @xcite . here , we focus on the dynamical mass generation in the noncommutative space . the noncommutative version of this phenomenon at one - loop has been discussed in @xcite , where it was found that the schwinger mass receives no noncommutative correction at this order .",
    "then , the work @xcite suggests that the schwinger mass acquires noncommutative correction at three - loop order .",
    "+ however , our analysis shows that the schwinger mass remains unaffected by noncommutativity to all orders .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the noncommutative schwinger model in the light - cone coordinates in order to simplify our calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , to obtain the mass spectrum of the theory at three - loop order , the photon self energy is studied at this level . using the explicit representation of the dirac @xmath4-matrices",
    "provides a straightforward method to compute the trace of the complicated fermionic loops .",
    "then , it is shown that the noncommutativity does not affect the schwinger mass in this order .",
    "extension of the three - loop computations to all orders is discussed in sec .",
    "iv where the exact mass spectrum is also obtained . in sec .",
    "v , we demonstrate that the noncommutative one - loop effective action for the photon is exactly the same as the commutative counterpart .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the lagrangian of the noncommutative schwinger model can be obtained from its commutative counterpart by replacing the ordinary product with the star - product which is defined as follows @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an antisymmetric constant matrix related to the noncommutative structure of the space - time . in two - dimensional space - time",

    "+ one of the useful properties of the two dimensional space is that our calculations in the light - cone coordinates , @xmath13 , are simplified significantly .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ g2 ] ) in the light - cone gauge , @xmath14 , has the following form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "+ in this particular gauge , the non - linear term in the field strength tensor is removed .",
    "therefore , the photon self interaction parts , three and four photon interaction vertices , are eliminated and the ghost fields are decoupled from the theory .",
    "the resulting feynman rules are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "+ note that only @xmath18 appears in the fermion - photon vertex .",
    "as it was mentioned before , schwinger showed that the photon in two dimensions acquires dynamical mass , @xmath19 .",
    "this mass generation originates from the presence of a special singularity in the scalar vacuum polarization at one loop order .",
    "using the non - perturbative method shows that the obtained mass does not receive any correction from loops at higher orders @xcite .",
    "+ the noncommutative extension of this kind of mass generation at one - loop level was discussed in @xcite where it was proved that the schwinger mass gets no noncommutative correction in this order .",
    "higher loop contributions , e.g. two - loop and three - loop , have been pointed out in @xcite without explicit computation of the loop integrals .",
    "+ at two - loop order , there is only one non - planar diagram but three - loop order includes two non - planar graphs . in the present section ,",
    "we analyze the calculation of three - loop non planar graphs to find the noncommutative corrections to the schwinger mass .",
    "the general structure of the exact photon propagator in two dimensional noncommutative space is the same as its commutative counterpart @xcite , namely @xmath20},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scalar vacuum polarization , @xmath21 , is related to its tensor form via the following @xmath22 here , @xmath21 includes the planar and non - planar parts . the pole structure is obtained from the following limit @xmath23 with fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the first term yields the exact commutative schwinger mass with @xmath24 and the second term gives the noncommutative corrections to it .",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of the second term at three loops ( fig .",

    "therefore , the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by @xmath31 plugging them in ( [ threeloop ] ) , we have @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since , the non - planar phase factor is independent of the fermionic loop momentum , @xmath33 , the related integral can be evaluated separately .",

    "what follows , this calculation will be extended to all orders of the quantum corrections .",
    "in this section , we generalize three - loop computation to all orders to obtain the exact mass spectrum . at @xmath43loop level , there are several non - planar diagrams contributing to the vacuum polarization tensor that one of them may be found in fig . 3 for which @xmath44 is an odd number .",
