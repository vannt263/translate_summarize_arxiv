    "after the success of the fermilab tevatron `` run 1 '' ( 1992 - 1995 ) , operating with protons on antiprotons with a center of mass energy of @xmath2 and a bunch spacing of @xmath3 , a shutdown ensued to upgrade the accelerator and the collider experiment detectors ( cdf and d ) for `` run 2 '' .",
    "the integrated luminosity used for physics results from run 1 was about @xmath4 , with typical instantaneous luminosities of @xmath5 ( with the best instantaneous luminosity about double this ) .",
    "physics quality data from run 2 started to be accumulated in earnest in the beginning of 2002 , at a higher energy of @xmath6 , and operating with a bunch spacing of @xmath7 .",
    "the integrated luminosity goal for run 2 has been reduced due to difficulties with accelerator performance , however , the aim now is accumulate between @xmath8 and @xmath9 by late this decade , which might still allow the tevatron sufficient sensitivity to discover the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson ( or a `` sm - like '' higgs boson ) , but clearly now with a reduced chance .",
    "the current status of the tevatron is given in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d  detectors are designed for general purpose use , with a tracking system within a superconducting solenoid ( 1.4 t at cdf and 2 t at d  ) , calorimetry , and a muon detection system . both detectors underwent major upgrades for run 2 , which involved new detectors , extended coverage of existing detector systems , and new daq and trigger systems .",
    "the tracking system consists of a silicon system for the precise measurement of secondary vertices from @xmath10 quark decays ( @xmath11 which results in @xmath12 hadrons traveling on average about 3 mm before decaying ) ; a central tracking system for the measurement of particle momentum and charge , which at cdf consists of wire chambers ( cot ) and a time of flight ( tof ) detector ( new in run 2 ) , and at d  consists of a fiber tracker .",
    "one of the important upgrades for both experiments is the use of tracking information in the trigger system , especially the use of silicon information to trigger on displaced vertices , to give very high statistics @xmath10 and @xmath13 quark samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : dets ] shows parts of the d   and cdf tracking detectors . outside the magnetic solenoid lies the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for the measurements of energy deposition .",
    "electrons , photons , and jets , deposit almost all their energy in the calorimeters .",
    "muons travel through the calorimeters depositing only a small fraction of their energy , and are detected by the muon chambers ( gas chambers ) which surround the calorimeters and steel absorbers .    in the following sections we will summarise a selection of past results using the cdf and d  detectors , and discuss what we expect in the next several years , concentrating on the physics involving the top quark , some electroweak measurements , and searches for higgs bosons .",
    "the run 1 results presented here come from about @xmath4 of integrated luminosity , and the current run 2 results from between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the large @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross - sections at the tevatron ( at @xmath16tev ; @xmath17 ,   @xmath18 ) give large statistics data samples for precision measurements of vector boson properties .",
    "only the leptonic decays are used , with the electron and muon channels providing the cleanest signals , but with the tau channels also considered to provide tests of lepton universality .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cross - section samples are also used extensively in other analyses for the determination of energy scales , resolutions , lepton identification efficiencies , and checks of detector responses and analysis tools .",
    "the @xmath21 signature is large missing transverse energy ( @xmath22 , typically required to be @xmath23 ) and a central isolated lepton with large transverse momentum ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the backgrounds are roughly @xmath25 for the electron and muon channels and @xmath26 for the tau decay channel .",
    "the @xmath27 signature is 2 central high-@xmath24 leptons with opposite charge .",
    "the signal is very clean for the electron and muon channels with backgrounds less than @xmath28 . at the time of this presentation",
    "the tau decay channel analysis was still in progress .",
    "the run 2 status of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross - section measurements is summarised in table  [ table : wzrun2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmu ] shows the tranverse mass spectra used for the @xmath29 cross - section and @xmath0 width measurements . in figure",
    "[ fig : wzcf ] the current run 2 @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross - section measurements are compared with the nnlo prediction  @xcite .    in the near future",
    "both experiments will significantly improve the precision of these measurements , together with various other precision measurement not discussed here such as the @xmath0 mass , @xmath0 width , @xmath0 charge asymmetry , @xmath0 polarization , drell - yan mass and forward - backward asymmetry .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ summary of tevatron run 2 @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross - section measurements from data taken up until january 2003 .",
    "the uncertainties given are statistical , systematic , and from the luminosity measurement , in that order . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : ljrun2 ]    as run 2 progresses the statistical limitations of the results presented here will be reduced dramatically , and after a few hundred @xmath30 of data the main limitations will be systematic . at the time of this writing new cross - section measurements",
    "are about to come out using more than @xmath4 , and this continual improvement of top quark measurements will continue for the next several years .",
    "the top cross - section measurements from run 1 , together with the first run 2 results are summarised in figure  [ fig : xsecvss ] .",
    "the run 2 results shown are only the combined d  topological and slt cross - section given above , and the combination of the cdf lepton + jets and dilepton cross - sections , which gives a result of @xmath31 . shown for comparison is a nlo prediction  @xcite where the upper and lower curves represent doubling and halving the central scale of @xmath32 and incorporate the spread from different pdf s .",
    "run 2 measurements of the top mass in both the dilepton and lepton + jets channels are also in progress . after accumulating approximately @xmath33 of run 2 data , it is expected the @xmath34 production cross - section will be measured to about @xmath25 , and the top mass to about 3gev . in both cases combinations of d  and",

    "within the sm mass is generated , and the electroweak symmetry is broken , by the higgs mechanism .",
    "all the particles of the sm have been observed , except for the higgs boson , so its discovery is currently one of the most important goals in high energy physics .",
    "precision electroweak measurements ( including the top mass ) predict a light sm higgs  @xcite of @xmath35 .",
    "the expected light higgs makes it possible to discover at the tevatron in the next few years , although with the reduced predicted run 2 integrated luminosity this goal is now less likely . in run 1 cdf and",
    "d  conducted searches for low mass higgs bosons ( @xmath36 ) , using its associated production with vector bosons ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) . at such masses",
    "the higgs decays predominantly to @xmath39 . therefore , even though the cross - section for @xmath40 ( 0.7pb at @xmath41 ) is much larger than the cross - sections for @xmath42 and @xmath43 production ( 0.16pb and 0.10pb respectively at @xmath41 and @xmath16tev )  @xcite , the tevatron experiments are more sensitive to the latter production mechanisms , as single higgs production is overwhelmed by an irreducible qcd di - jet background .    in run 1",
    "searches were conducted in the following associated sm higgs decay channels :    * @xmath44 ( with at least 1 @xmath10-tagged jet ) : signal characterised by 2 highly energetic leptons ( @xmath45 gev ) and 2 jets . * @xmath46 ( with at least one @xmath10-tagged jet ) : signal characterised by large missing energy and 2 jets .",
    "* @xmath47 ( with at least one @xmath10-tagged jet ) : signal characterised by one energetic lepton , large missing energy and 2 jets . * @xmath48 ( with at least two @xmath10-tagged jets ) : signal characterised by 4 jets .    in the absence of any observed signal ,",
    "cross - section limits were determined by fitting the observed spectra to a combination of the expected di - jet spectra from background processes and from @xmath42 and @xmath43 signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : vh ] summarises the cdf 95% confidence level ( cl ) cross - section limits for all the individual decay channels as well as the combined result , as a function of the higgs mass .",
    "the limits are about 30 times higher than the sm predictions , which sets the scale for the luminosity needed in order to observe the sm higgs boson in run 2 .",
    "production are shown as a function of higgs mass for the different decay channels analysed .",
    "also shown is the region excluded by lep2 .",

    "the resolution of the @xmath39 invariant mass is critical for light higgs searches . to this end ,",
    "the success of the cdf and d  silicon vertex triggers is crucial , from which a large @xmath49 sample will be obtained for calibrating the tagging efficiency and mass resolution .",
    "it is also important for cdf and d  to combine results for maximal sensitivity .",
    "run 2 sensitivity studies indicate that with about @xmath50 of data ( the current upper limit projected for run 2 ) evidence for higgs production at the 3@xmath51 level is possible for @xmath52 , and exclusion at the 95% level is possible up to a higgs mass of @xmath53  @xcite . in run 2 searches for @xmath54",
    "are also in progress which will provide limits in the intermediate higgs mass range ( assuming something is nt found ) .",
    "both the cdf and d  detectors are working well in run 2 and the understanding of their performance is now leading to high quality physics results .",
    "we have reported on preliminary run 2 results in electroweak and top quark physics , and summarised the relevant run 1 results for comparison . with the recent improvements in the tevatron s performance ,",
    "these run 2 results represent the beginning of a rich program in electroweak , top quark , and higgs physics in the next few years .",
