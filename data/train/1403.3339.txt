    "the introduction of coherent optical receivers has brought significant advantages in fiber optical communications , e.g. , enabling efficient polarization demultiplexing , higher - order modulation formats , increased sensitivity , and electrical mitigation of transmission impairments@xcite . even if the linear transmission impairments ( such as chromatic and polarization - mode dispersion ) can be dealt with electronically",
    ", the kerr nonlinearity in the fiber remains a significant obstacle .",
    "since the nonlinearity causes signal distortions at high signaling powers , arbitrarily high signal - to - noise ratios are inaccessible , which limits transmission over long distances and high spectral efficiencies .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as the `` nonlinear shannon limit '' @xcite .    for systems with large accumulated dispersion and weak nonlinearity ,",
    "the joint effect of chromatic dispersion and the kerr effect is similar to that of additive gaussian noise .",
    "this was pointed out already by splett @xcite and tang @xcite .",
    "the emergence of this gaussian noise is prevalent in links that have no inline dispersion compensation , such as today s coherent links , where the dispersion compensation takes place electronically in the receiver signal processing .",
    "this gaussian noise approximation has been recently rediscovered and applied to today s coherent links in a series of papers by poggiolini _",
    "_ @xcite and other groups @xcite . the resulting so - called gaussian noise model , or _ gn model _ for short , is valid for multi - channel ( wavelength- and polarization - division multiplexed ) signals .",
    "it has also been shown to work for single - channel and single - polarization transmission if the dispersive decorrelation is large enough @xcite . a crucial assumption in the derivation of the gn model",
    "is that of independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "inputs : the transmitted symbols are independent of each other , are drawn from the same constellation , and have the same constellation scaling ( the same average transmit power ) . under these assumptions , the model has been experimentally verified to be very accurate @xcite for the most common modulation formats , such as quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) or phase - shift keying .    in this paper ,",
    "the assumption of i.i.d .",
    "inputs is , perhaps for the first time in optical channel modeling , relaxed .",
    "this is done by introducing a modified gn model , which we call the _ finite - memory gn model_. this new model includes the memory of the channel as a parameter and differs from previous channel models in that it is valid also when the channel input statistics are time - varying , or when `` heavy - tailed '' constellations are used .",
    "the performance predicted by the regular gn model ( both in terms of uncoded error probability and channel capacity ) is compared with the ones predicted by the finite - memory gn model .",
    "the _ uncoded _ performance is characterized in terms of symbol error rate ( ser ) and bit error rate ( ber ) , assuming i.i.d .",
    "exact analytical expressions are obtained for 16-ary qam ( 16-qam ) , which show that the gn model is accurate for uncoded transmission and standard modulation formats , confirming previous results .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are in terms of _ coded _ performance .",
    "shannon , the father of information theory , proved that for a given channel , it is possible to achieve an arbitrarily small error probability , if the transmission rate in bits per symbol is small enough .",
    "a rate for which virtually error - free transmission is possible is called an _ achievable rate _ and the supremum over all achievable rates for a given channel , represented as a statistical relation between its input @xmath0 and output @xmath1 , is defined as the _ channel capacity _ @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a capacity - approaching transmission scheme operates in general by grouping the data to be transmitted into blocks , encoding each block into a sequence of coded symbols , modulating and transmitting this sequence over the channel , and decoding the block in the receiver .",
    "this coding process introduces , by definition , dependencies among the transmitted symbols , which is the reason why channel models derived for i.i.d .",
    "inputs may be questionable for the purpose of capacity analysis .",
    "more fundamentally , the regular gn model is not well - suited to capacity analysis , because in this model each output sample depends on the statistics of the previously transmitted input symbols ( through their average power ) rather than on their actual value .",
    "this yields artifacts in capacity analysis .",
    "one such artifact is the peaky behavior of the capacity of the gn model as a function of the transmit power . indeed , through a capacity lower bound it is shown in this paper that this peaky behavior does not occur for the finite - memory gn model , even when the memory is taken to be arbitrary large .",
    "the analysis of channel capacity for fiber - optical transmission dates back to 1993 @xcite , when splett _",
    "_ quantified the impact of nonlinear four - wave mixing on the channel capacity . by applying shannon s formula for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel capacity to a channel with power - dependent noise , splett _ et al .",
    "_ found that there exists an `` optimal '' _ finite _ signal - to - noise ratio that maximizes capacity . beyond this value",
    ", capacity starts decreasing .",
    "it was however not motivated in @xcite why the noise was assumed gaussian .",
    "using a different model for four - wave mixing , stark @xcite showed that capacity saturates , but does not decrease , at high power . in the same paper , the capacity loss due to the quantum nature of light was quantified . in 2001 , mitra and stark @xcite considered the capacity in links where cross - phase modulation dominates , proved that the capacity is lower - bounded by the capacity of a linear , gaussian channel with the same input ",
    "output covariance matrix , and evaluated this bound via shannon s awgn formula . the obtained bound vanishes at high input power .",
    "it was claimed , without motivation , that the true capacity would have the same qualitative nonmonotonic behavior .    since 2001",
    ", the interest in optical channel capacity has virtually exploded .",

    "a coherent optical communication link converts a discrete , complex - valued electric data signal @xmath11 to a modulated , continuous optical signal , which is transmitted through an optical fiber , received coherently , and then converted back to a discrete output sequence @xmath12 .",
    "the coherent link is particularly simple theoretically , in that the transmitter and receiver directly map the electric data to the optical _ field _ , which is a linear operation ( in contrast with , e.g. , direct - detection receivers ) , and can ideally be performed without distortions .",
    "the channel is then well described by the propagation of the ( continuous ) optical field in the fiber link .",
    "it should be emphasized that this assumes the coherent receiver to be ideal , with perfect synchronization and negligible phase noise .",
    "experiments have shown @xcite that commercial coherent receivers can indeed perform well enough for the fiber propagation effects to be the main limitations .",
    "two main _ linear _ propagation effects in the fiber need to be addressed : _ dispersion _ and _ attenuation_. the attenuation effects can be overcome by periodic optical amplification , at the expense of additive gaussian noise from the inline amplifiers .",
    "the dispersion effects are usually equalized electronically by a filter in the coherent receiver .",
    "such a linear optical link can be well - described by an awgn channel , the capacity of which is unbounded with the signal power .",
    "however , the fiber kerr - nonlinearity introduces signal distortions , and greatly complicates the transmission modeling . the nonlinear signal propagation in the fiber",
    "is described by a nonlinear partial differential equation , the _ nonlinear schrdinger equation _ ( nlse ) , which includes dispersion , attenuation , and nonlinearity . at high power levels ,",
    "the three effects can no longer be conveniently separated .",
    "however , in contemporary coherent links ( distance at least @xmath13 and symbol rate at least @xmath14 ) , the nonlinearity is significantly weaker than the other two effects , and a perturbation approach can be successfully applied to the nlse @xcite .",
    "this leads to the gn model , which will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model.infinite ] .      even today",
    "s highly dispersive optical links have a finite memory .",
    "for example , a signal with dispersive length @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the group velocity dispersion and @xmath17 the optical bandwidth , broadens ( temporally ) a factor @xmath18 over a fiber of length @xmath19 . with typical dispersion lengths of @xmath20@xmath21 , this broadening factor can correspond to hundreds to thousands of adjacent symbols , a large but _ finite _ number .",
    "the same will hold for interaction among wdm channels ; if one interprets @xmath17 as the channel separation , @xmath18 will give an approximation of the number of symbols that two wdm channels separate due to walk - off ( and hence interact with nonlinearly during transmission ) .",
    "the channel memory will thus be even larger in the wdm case , and increase with channel separation , but the nonlinear interaction will decrease due to the shorter @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the principle of a finite channel memory holds also for wdm signals . to keep notation as simple as possible",
    ", we will consider a single , scalar , wavelength channel in this paper .",
    "extensions to dual polarizations and wdm are possible , but will involve obscuring complications such as four - dimensional constellation space @xcite in the former case and behavioral models @xcite in the latter .",
    "we can thus say that in an optical link a certain signal may sense the interference from @xmath23 neighboring symbols , which is the physical reason for introducing a finite - memory model .",
    "if we let the range @xmath24 of the interfering symbols go to infinity , an even simpler type of model is obtained . the interference is now averaged over infinitely many transmitted symbols . assuming that an i.i.d .",
    "sequence is transmitted , this time average converges to a statistical average , which greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "all models suggested for dispersive optical channels so far belong to this category @xcite , of which the gn model described in sec .  [ sec : model.infinite ] is the most common .    for a given transmitted complex symbol @xmath25",
    ", the ( complex ) single - channel output at each discrete - time @xmath26 is modeled as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a circularly symmetric , complex , white , gaussian random sequence , independent of @xmath25 . in , @xmath29 is assumed to be independent of the actual transmitted sequence @xmath25 . however , the _ variance _ of @xmath29 depends on the transmit power , as detailed in sec .",

    ", we will refer to models that depend on infinitely many past and/or future symbols , via @xmath41 in or in some other way , as _ infinite - memory _ models .",
    "the cubic relation in   between the transmit power and the additive noise variance @xmath44 is a consequence of the kerr nonlinearity , and holds for both lumped and distributed amplification schemes .",
    "the constant @xmath33 represents the total amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) noise of the optical amplifiers for the channel under study , while @xmath34 quantifies the nli .",
    "several related expressions for this coefficient have been proposed .",

    ", where @xmath46 is the fiber nonlinear coefficient , @xmath47 is the total wdm bandwidth , and @xmath48 is the symbol rate .",
    "obviously , the expressions in and are qualitatively similar",

    "@xmath51 is the attenuation coefficient of the fiber and the coefficient @xmath52 is between 0 and 1 ( see @xcite ) depending on how well the nonlinear interference decorrelates between each amplifier span . for single polarization transmission , the coefficient @xmath53 in ( [ nli : beygi ] ) should be replaced by @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the benefits of the gn model is that it is very accurate for uncoded transmission with traditional modulation formats , as demonstrated in experiments and simulations @xcite , and that it is very simple to analyze .",
    "it is , however , not intended for nonstationary input sequences , i.e. , sequences whose statistics vary with time , because the transmit power @xmath41 in is defined as the ( constant ) power of a random variable that generates the i.i.d .",
    "symbols @xmath11 . in order to capture the behavior of a wider class of transmission schemes ,",
    "the gn model can be modified to depend on a time - varying transmit power , which is the topic of the next section .      as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] and [ sec : model.infinite ] , a finite - memory model is essential in order to model the channel output corresponding to time - varying input distributions .",
    "therefore , we refine the gn model in sec .  [",
    "sec : model.infinite ] to make it explicitly dependent on the channel memory @xmath24 , in such a way that the model `` converges '' to the regular gn model as @xmath55 .",
    "many such models can be formulated . in this paper",
    ", we aim for simplicity rather than accuracy .",
    "the proposed model assumes that the input ",
    "output relation is still given by , but the average transmit power  @xmath56 in   is replaced by an _ empirical power _ ,",
    "i.e. ,  by the arithmetic average of the squared magnitude of the symbol @xmath57 and of the @xmath58 symbols around it .",
    "mathematically ,   is replaced by @xmath59 for any @xmath26 , where @xmath24 is the ( one - sided ) _ channel memory_. we refer to and as the _ finite - memory gn model_.",
    "since ( second - order ) group velocity dispersion causes symmetric broadening with respect to the transit time of the signal , inter - symbol interference from dispersion will act both backwards and forwards in terms of the symbol index .",
    "this is why both past and future inputs contribute to the noise power in  .",
    "a somewhat related model for the additive noise in the context of data transmission in electronic circuits has been recently proposed in  @xcite , where the memory is single - sided and the noise scales linearly with the signal power , not cubically as in .",
    "having introduced the finite - memory gn model , we now discuss some particular cases .",
    "first , the memoryless awgn channel model can be obtained from both the gn and finite - memory gn models by setting @xmath60 . in this case , the noise variance is @xmath61={p_\\text{ase}}$ ] for all @xmath43 .",
    "second , let us consider the scenario where the transmitted symbols is the random process @xmath62 . then the empirical power @xmath63 at any discrete time @xmath43 is a random variable that depends on the magnitude of the @xmath43th symbol and the @xmath58 symbols around it . in the limit @xmath55",
    ", this empirical power converges to the `` statistical '' power @xmath56 in , for any i.i.d .",
    "process with power @xmath56 , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : model.infinite ] .",
    "this observation shows that the proposed finite - memory model in `` converges '' to the gn model in , provided that the channel memory @xmath24 is sufficiently large and that the process consists of i.i.d .",
    "symbols with zero mean and variance @xmath56 .",
    "the purpose of the finite - memory model is to be able to predict the output of the channel when the transmitted symbols are not i.i.d .",
    "this is the case for example when the transmitted symbols are a nonstationary process ( as will be exemplified in sec .",
    "[ sec : pulses ] ) and also for coded sequences ( which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : capacity ] ) .",
    "an advantage of the finite - memory model , from a theoretic viewpoint , is that the input ",
    "output relation of the channel is modeled as a fixed conditional probability of the output given the input and its history , which is the common notion of a channel model in communication and information theory ever since the work of shannon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the regular gn model and other channel models , whose conditional distribution change depending on which transmitter the channel is connected to .",
    "specifically , the gn model is represented by a family of such conditional distributions , one for each value of the transmitter parameter @xmath41 .",

    "a drawback with the proposed finite - memory model is that it is more complex than the gn model .",
    "also , our model is not accurate for small values of @xmath24 , since the gn assumption relies on the central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that all the @xmath58 symbols around the symbol @xmath57 affect the noise variance equally . in practice , this is not the case .",
    "we nevertheless use the proposed model in this paper because it is relatively easy to analyze ( see sec .",

    "we extended the popular gn model for nonlinear fiber channels with a parameter to account for the channel memory .",
    "the extended channel model , which is given by , is able to model the time - varying output of an optical fiber whose input is a nonstationary process .",
    "if the input varies on a time scale comparable to or longer than the memory of the channel , then this model gives more realistic results than the regular gn model , as we showed in fig .",
