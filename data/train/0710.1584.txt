    "the constraints on the power - law extrapolation of egret sources by sensitive h.e.s.s.upper limits as derived in the previous sections are naturally only valid under the assumption that the vhe counterpart to the egret emission does not exhibit a size much larger than @xmath17",
    ".      the non - detection of most tev sources in the gev range by egret may be due simply to a lack of instrumental sensitivity .",

    "<S> recent observations with atmospheric cherenkov telescope systems such as h.e.s.s .  and magic have revealed a large number of new sources of very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays from 100  gev  100  tev , mostly concentrated along the galactic plane . at lower energies ( 100 </S>",
    "<S> mev  10 gev ) the satellite - based instrument egret revealed a population of sources clustering along the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> given their adjacent energy bands a systematic correlation study between the two source catalogues seems appropriate . here </S>",
    "<S> , the populations of galactic sources in both energy domains are characterised on observational as well as on phenomenological grounds . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly few common sources are found in terms of positional coincidence and spectral consistency . </S>",
    "<S> these common sources and their potential counterparts and emission mechanisms will be discussed in detail . in cases of detection only in one energy band , for the first time consistent upper limits in the other energy band </S>",
    "<S> have been derived . </S>",
    "<S> the egret upper limits are rather unconstraining due to the sensitivity mismatch to current vhe instruments . </S>",
    "<S> the vhe upper limits put strong constraints on simple power - law extrapolation of several of the egret spectra and thus strongly suggest cutoffs in the unexplored energy range from 10  gev  100  gev . </S>",
    "<S> physical reasons for the existence of cutoffs and for differences in the source population at gev and tev energies will be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , predictions will be derived for common gev  </S>",
    "<S> tev sources for the upcoming glast mission bridging for the first time the energy gap between current gev and tev instruments . </S>"
