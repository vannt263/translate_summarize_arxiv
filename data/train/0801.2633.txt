    "the @xmath0 reaction has been quite controversial given the large discrepancies between different theoretical approaches trying to match the scarce experimental data . for a long time the standard experimental results",
    "have been those of early experiments @xcite,@xcite , giving @xmath2ev .",
    "more recent experiments with the crystal ball detector at ags @xcite reduced this value to @xmath3ev .",
    "a new reanalysis of ags data gives @xmath4ev @xcite and a more recent analysis with the crystal ball at mami provides the rate @xmath5ev @xcite . at the same time",
    "the last two experiments have provided the much awaited invariant mass distribution for the two photons , which was thought to provide valuable information concerning the theoretical interpretation .",
    "some preliminary results from kloe at frascati @xcite are also available with values around @xmath6  ev .",
    "the theoretical models show also a similar dispersion of the results , from large values obtained using models with quark box diagrams @xcite to much smaller ones , obtained mostly using ideas of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , which are quoted in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction has been traditionally considered to be a border line problem to test chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the reason is that the tree level amplitudes , both at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , vanish .",
    "the first non - vanishing contribution comes at @xmath8 , either from loops involving kaons , largely suppressed due to the kaon masses , or from pion loops , again suppressed since they violate g parity and are thus proportional to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the first sizable contribution comes at @xmath10 but the coefficients involved are not precisely determined and one must recur to models . in this sense , either vector meson dominance ( vmd ) @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite , or the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model ( enjl ) @xcite , have been used to determine these coefficients .",
    "however , the use of tree level vmd to obtain the @xmath10 chiral coefficients by expanding the vector meson propagators , leads @xcite to results about a factor of two smaller than the `` all order '' vmd term when one keeps the full vector meson propagator .",
    "the lesson obtained from these studies is that chpt can be used as a guiding principle but the strict chiral counting has to be abandoned since the @xmath10 and higher orders involved in the full ( `` all order '' ) vmd results are larger than those of @xmath8 .",
    "also these calculations had several sources of uncertainty , one of the most important was the contribution of the @xmath11 resonance , for which not even the sign was known .",
    "thus , one is lead to rely directly on mechanisms for the reaction , leaving apart the strict chiral counting .",
    "the theoretical situation improved significantly with the thorough revision of the problem in @xcite , where the different sources of uncertainty were studied and the @xmath11 contribution was reliably included by using the unitary extensions of chpt @xcite . within this chiral unitary approach for the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons the @xmath11 , as well as the @xmath12 or the @xmath13 resonances ,",
    "are dynamically generated by using as input the lowest order chiral lagrangians @xcite and resuming the multiple scattering series by means of the bethe salpeter equation .",
    "another source of corrections in @xcite was the use of the newest data for radiative decay of vector mesons of the pdg 2002 @xcite .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that the rates had significantly changed from previous editions of the pdg , to the point that the @xmath0 widths calculated in @xcite would have changed by about a factor of two should one have used the new data for radiative decay of vector mesons of the pdg 2002 instead of the former ones .",
    "another improvement in @xcite was the unitarization of the pair of mesons of the vmd terms beyond the tree level .",
    "furthermore , to have a better control on the reaction , the consistency of the model with the related reaction @xmath14 was established . finally , in @xcite",
    "a thorough analysis of the theoretical errors was done by considering all sources of uncertainty and making a montecarlo sample of results obtained with random values of the input within the uncertainties .",
    "the final result obtained in @xcite was @xmath15 which is still in agreement with the present experimental results within uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , five years after the publication of these results some novelties have appeared that call for a revision of the problem .",
    "indeed , once again the data for the radiative decay of vector mesons of the `` on line '' pdg 2007 @xcite have significantly changed with respect to the data of the pdg 2002 used in ref .",
    "the correction due to these changes is important and it produces about a 25% decrease in the central value of the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : oldresult ] ) . at the same time",
    ", the theoretical uncertainty is reduced by almost a factor of two . on the other hand ,",
    "the new experimental results regarding the two photon invariant mass distribution @xcite provide an extra challenge for the theoretical models .    in view of this ,",
    "it has become necessary to update the work of @xcite to account for the newest experimental results of the pdg  2007 @xcite and to compare with the most recent experimental data of the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the model used here is , hence , the same as the one of @xcite and the only changes are the use as input of the new vector mesons radiative widths .",
    "thus , we refrain from providing detailed explanations on the model and in this brief report we just concentrate on the changes .",
    "following @xcite we consider the vmd mechanism of fig .",
    "[ fig : vmdtree ]    which can be easily derived from the vmd lagrangians involving vvp and @xmath16 couplings @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are standard @xmath20 matrices for the vector mesons and pseudoscalar mesons respectively @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath23mev , with @xmath24 the coupling of @xmath25 to @xmath26 in the normalization of @xcite . from eq",
    ".  ( [ lagr ] ) one can obtain the radiative decay widths for @xmath27 , which are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the photon momentum for the vector meson at rest and @xmath30 are @xmath20 coefficients that we give in table  [ tab : br ] for the different radiative decays , together with the theoretical results ( using @xmath31mev and @xmath23mev ) and experimental @xcite branching ratios . in table  [ tab : br ] we quote the results of the pdg version of 2002 , which were used as input in the evaluation of the results in @xcite , together with the new results of the pdg  2007 on - line edition @xcite which are used in the present paper .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement of the theoretical results with the data is fair but they can be improved by incorporating @xmath20 breaking mechanisms @xcite . for that purpose , we normalize here the @xmath30 couplings so that the branching ratios in table  [ tab : br ] agree with experiment .",
    "once the @xmath32 couplings have been fixed in this way , we can use them in the vmd amplitude corresponding to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vmdtree ] , for what we follow the details of @xcite .",
    "next we briefly describe the other mechanisms considered in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite other mechanisms were considered which are not affected by the modifications of the previous section .",
    "we refresh them graphically and forward the reader to @xcite for details .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] we show the diagrams that go through kaon loops .",
    "these diagrams , with the unitarization of the meson - meson interaction depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , were shown in @xcite to be mostly responsible for the strength of the @xmath33 reaction in the region of the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the consideration of the mechanisms of fig .",
    "[ fig : vmdtree ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] improved the agreement with the data at low @xmath34 invariant masses .    the vector meson exchange diagrams of fig .  [",
    "fig : vmdtree ] were unitarized in @xcite by including the resummation of diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , producing the diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] , where the thick dot represents the full meson - meson unitarized amplitude .",
    "note that these mechanisms are also affected by the renormalization of the @xmath35 vertices discussed in the previous section .",
    "finally , a small term related to the three meson axial anomaly , and shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig.9 ] , was also taken in the calculation since , as noted in @xcite , although small by itself gives a non - negligible contribution upon interference with the other terms .",
    "by considering all the modifications discussed in section  [ sec : vmd ] , the integrated width that we obtain is    @xmath36    which should be compared to the result of @xcite of @xmath37 .",
    "the new result compares favorably with the most recent results of cristal ball at ags @xmath38 and mami @xmath39 @xcite",
    ". however , all these decay widths are much larger than the preliminary results of kloe at frascati @xmath6  ev @xcite .",
    "the mass distribution of the two photons provides extra information which was claimed to be relevant to further test theoretical models . in @xcite",
    "the differential cross section @xmath40 was given .",
    "we present here the updated results in fig .",
    "[ mi ] , where the contribution of the different mechanisms is shown .",
    "the new experiments reported in @xcite provide measurements of @xmath41 which can be contrasted with theoretical predictions .",
    "note that in the experiments of @xcite the magnitude @xmath41 is given , while in @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ mi ] @xmath40 is evaluated .",
    "although these distributions are equivalent , in practice the first one is more useful to study the spectrum at low invariant masses since it provides extra information not given by the second one .",
    "indeed , @xmath40 is zero at the threshold of the @xmath42 phase space .",
    "however , @xmath41 contains an extra @xmath43 factor and leads to a finite value at zero @xmath42 invariant mass .",
    "this finite value and the shape of the distribution close to threshold offer an extra test to the theory that would be missed had we simply taken @xmath40 for comparison .",
    "this of course implies that the measurements can be done with good precision at the threshold . on the other hand , for the high mass region of the spectrum",
    "the @xmath40 distribution is more suited to reveal the effects of different theoretical mechanisms , as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ mi ] .    in figs .",
    "[ mi2mami ] and [ mi2ags ] we compare the theoretical results that we obtain with the distributions obtained at mami and ags .",
    "the agreement is good , in shape and size , and the theory provides indeed a finite value at threshold compatible with experiment , which has nevertheless large errors .",
    "it is interesting to see that the ags data show clearly an increase of the distribution at low invariant masses which is a feature of the theoretical results .",
    "the data of mami , however , have too large errors at threshold and does not allow one to see this trend of the results . at large values of the invariant mass the agreement of the theory with the mami data is better than with the ags data .",
    "+    in order to offer a different perspective of the comparison of the results at the higher mass region of the distribution , we show in figs .",
    "[ mimami ] and [ miags ] our final results for @xmath40 compared to the data of @xcite properly transformed to these variables .",
    "in summary , we have witnessed an important experimental advance in the recent years on the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the parallel advances in theory reflected by the work of @xcite have allowed a detailed comparison of results which has given a good agreement both for the total rate as well as for the invariant mass distributions with the most recent finished results .",
    "the discrepancy with the preliminary data of frascati is worrisome , but we should wait till these data are firm before elaborating further on the discrepancies .",
