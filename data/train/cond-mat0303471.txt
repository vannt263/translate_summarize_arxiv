    "the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 was recently discovered to be the first pr - based heavy fermion superconductor , with a superconducting transition temperature @xmath9 k and an effective mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of the free electron @xcite .",
    "features observed in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 , specific heat @xmath13 , and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite all indicate that the hund s rule @xmath14 multiplet of the pr@xmath5 ion is split by the crystalline electric field ( cef ) .",
    "an analysis of these data within the context of a cubic cef using the theory of lea , leask and wolf ( llw ) yielded a @xmath8 nonmagnetic doublet ground state , a @xmath15 triplet first excited state at @xmath16 k , and higher @xmath17 triplet and @xmath18 singlet excited states at @xmath19 k and @xmath20 k , respectively .",
    "a ` roll - off ' near @xmath21 k with electrical resistivity @xmath6 in zero magnetic field was attributed to a decrease in spin or charge dependent scattering from the low - lying @xmath15 excited state whose population decreases with decreasing temperature , while features in @xmath22 at low temperatures @xmath23 k and high fields @xmath24 t were identified with a high field ordered phase ( hfop ) of magnetic or quadrupolar character @xcite .    in a lanthanide compound , the conduction electrons interact with the localized @xmath25f electrons through magnetic exchange and the direct coulomb interaction . for lanthanide ions",
    "whose @xmath25f electrons are hybridized with conduction electrons , the exchange interaction can be negative , which favors screening of the magnetic moments of the @xmath25f electrons by the conduction electron spins .",
    "this leads to contributions to the electrical resistivity that increase as @xmath26 with decreasing temperature that are associated with the kondo effect .",
    "since no kondo - like contribution has been found in @xmath6 , we disregard @xmath25f conduction electron hybridization and treat the @xmath25f electrons in the ionic limit , as a first approximation .",
    "when the degeneracy of the hund s rule multiplet of a lanthanide ion is lifted in a crystalline electric field , the change of the resulting lanthanide energy level populations with temperature introduces temperature - dependent features in the electrical resistivity .",
    "these features are more subtle than those seen in properties such as magnetic susceptibility and specific heat , but can still be described based on the cef hamiltonian of lea , leask , and wolf ( llw ) @xcite .",
    "this paper presents calculations of the electrical resistivity due to magnetic exchange and aspherical coulomb scattering associated with the cef splitting of the pr@xmath5 hund s rule multiplet in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 .",
    "electrical resistivity @xmath6 data in zero magnetic field are directly fit with the calculated equations , providing parameters that are used to calculate @xmath7 isotherms .",
    "it is shown that a @xmath8 ground state can qualitatively account for the ` dome - shaped ' features that have been observed in the measured @xmath7 isotherms .",
    "the effects on electrical resistivity due to magnetic exchange @xcite and aspherical coulomb @xcite scattering have been separately considered many times in the past ; often one effect was neglected over the other .",
    "the present calculations follow the procedure of fisk and johnston @xcite , where it was demonstrated that both contributions are important for describing the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for the compound prb@xmath27 and , in addition , the relevant equations were presented in a form appropriate to the stevens operator equivalent formulation of the llw crystal field hamiltonian @xcite . in this notation @xcite ,",

    "the temperature dependent matrix , @xmath31 , is common to both terms : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of the cef eigenstates and @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 matrix represents magnetic exchange scattering , and the @xmath36 matrix is associated with aspherical coulomb scattering due to the quadrupolar charge distribution of the pr@xmath5 ion .",
    "the @xmath37 matrices are : @xmath38 @xmath39 where the @xmath40 s are the cef eigenstates , and the @xmath41 s are the operator equivalents of the spherical harmonics for @xmath42 ( i.e. , quadrupolar terms ) , and are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 matrices are also normalized to each other @xcite , such that @xmath43    using matthieson s rule , the electrical resistivity is separated into impurity , phonon , and cef contributions : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the impurity scattering term , @xmath46 is the lattice term of the previously measured isostructural compound without f - electrons , laos@xmath3sb@xmath4 @xcite , and @xmath47 is given by eq.([rhocef ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath48 was used to scale the lattice contributions of @xmath6 of laos@xmath3sb@xmath4 and pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 to one another , assuming they have the same temperature dependence , and to account for uncertainties in the geometrical factor due to the irregular shape of the crystals and/or microcracks in the crystals . for @xmath28 , the energies @xmath33",
    "can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 in accordance with the llw formalism @xcite . in the absence of a magnetic field , the eigenstates @xmath40 are the same for all values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath14 in a cubic cef .",

    "[ fit ] ) .",
    "since the magnetic exchange and aspherical coulomb scattering contributions to the cef are nearly temperature independent above @xmath65 k , the discrepancy is most likely due to the laos@xmath3sb@xmath4 lattice term not being an accurate representation of the pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 lattice term , which is reasonable considering the anomalous resistivities of other la - based compounds compared to their y and lu - based counterparts without f - electrons @xcite .",

    "the value of the cef scattering ratio @xmath30 was fixed at various values to determine how the other parameters would change . the larger the aspherical coulomb scattering contribution ( smaller @xmath30 ) , the closer the value of @xmath68 to values previously calculated .",

    "the ` domes ' in @xmath7 are especially intriguing , as it is expected that scattering should be lower in an ordered state .",
    "it has been suggested that the crossing of the cef energy levels in magnetic fields are related to the high field ordered phase @xcite and can contribute to the increase of scattering in this region .",

    "this value of @xmath30 was used because it is consistent with the value determined by fisk and johnston for prb@xmath27 @xcite as well as being a compromise between aspherical coulomb scattering , which results in a @xmath68 that is closer to values estimated from other analyses ( @xmath75 , ins ) , and magnetic exchange scattering , which is more universal in lanthanide compounds .",
