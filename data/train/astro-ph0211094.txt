    "the burst had a duration of approximately 100 s and consisted of two peaks separated by approximately 25 s. each peak had a fast rise and exponential decay profile and a power - law spectrum with a slope of 1.64 @xcite .",
    "the fregate instrument on _ hete - ii _ measured a fluence of @xmath13  erg  @xmath14 between 50 and 300  kev and @xmath15  erg  @xmath14 between 7 and 400  kev .",
    "the wxm fluence ( 225  kev ) is @xmath16  erg  @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the grb absorption system shows strong similarities with associated qso absorbers , i.e. , an outflow velocity of several 1000  km  s@xmath21 , high ionization , and line - locking @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the location of the grb 3.5 minutes after the burst with the riken automated telescope and found an upper limit for the unfiltered magnitude of 13.6 .",
    "the optical afterglow ( oa ) was identified 9.45 minutes after the _ hete - ii _ trigger by the 48-inch oschin / neat robotic telescope @xcite .",
    "the rapid identification allowed for near - continuous monitoring of this burst s oa .",
    "it quickly became apparent that the oa was not following a simple power - law decay but had rebrightened approximately 0.1 days after the burst .",
    "further observations suggested that there were rapid variation in the optical decay @xcite similar to those seen in @xcite , and larger deviations from a power law decay on scales of hours to a day @xcite .",
    "the large variations in s optical decay are unusual , but not unheard of in grb afterglows . was the second grb for which an oa was identified .",
    "this oa had a constant luminosity for approximately one day after the burst then brightened by a factor of approximately six before taking on the familiar power - law decay @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this behavior could be explained if there is an additional injection of energy into the external shock at later times .",
    "this additional energy could come from a shell of ejecta moving more slowly than the main body of ejecta impacting on the external medium .",
    "also exhibited significant deviations from a broken power - law decay for several days after the burst .",
    "@xcite found that these deviations were consistent with the oa being microlensed . @xcite and @xcite observed rapid variations in the optical decay of which @xcite interpret as being due to small - scale density fluctuations in the ambient medium within 0.1  pc of the progenitor .",
    "as rapid responses to grbs become more common optical observations will be able to probe the first few hours of more grbs and allow observations of the prompt emission .",
    "this will provide a window into the physics of the early oa .",

    "electron indices of less than two represent infinite energy in the standard relativistic fireball model @xcite .",
    "this can be avoided by introducing an upper limit for the electron energy distribution @xcite , but detailed modeling of the acceleration of particles in highly relativistic shocks predict that the electron index should be approximately 2.3 @xcite , which is inconsistent with our results .",
    "the fact that many grbs appear to have electron indices of less than two may indicate the need for detailed hydrodynamic modeling of grb afterglows in order to accurately determine the fireball parameters .",
    "our results are consistent with a clumpy ism near the progenitor as proposed by @xcite .",
    "their scenario assumes that the grb occurred in an ism that is inhomogeneous on sub - parsec scales and predicts @xmath222 .",
    "variations in the density of the ambient medium of @xmath218 can explain the observed fluctuations on the optical decay of .",
    "@xcite have shown that the deviations from a power law in the optical decay can be used to reconstruct the density profile in the vicinity of the progenitor .",
    "both groups find that the observed variations in the optical decay of are consistent with an ambient medium that is homogeneous on scales of approximately @xmath7 cm with a density enhancement of @xmath223 at approximately @xmath10  cm from the progenitor .",
    "the observations of are also broadly consistent with a relativistic fireball crossing a discontinuity in the ism .",
    "@xcite find that a density jump at @xmath224 cm from a grb can produce an increase of a factor of a few in the optical flux .    extrapolating the predicted pre - cooling break slope to approximately ten minutes after the burst ( see fig .  [",
    "figure : gcns ] ) shows that the early data of @xcite are consistent with our predicted optical decay of @xmath225 before the cooling break . @xcite",
    "present a model where the optical flux before approximately one hour after the burst is dominated by optical emission from reverse shocks .",
    "their model requires @xmath226 , which is significantly higher than the electron index which we deduce from the @xmath1-ray and optical spectra .",
    "the agreement between the optical decay which is predicted by the spectral slopes and that seen at approximately ten minutes after the burst suggests that the physical mechanism controlling the observed flux at @xmath11 minutes is the same as the one operating at @xmath12 days .",
    "we present @xmath0 photometry of the oa of taken at the not and _ chandra _ @xmath1-ray data .",
    "the optical data were taken between approximately eight hours and 30 days after the burst while the @xmath1-ray data was taken approximately one day after the burst .",
    "the broad - band optical sed yields an intrinsic spectral slope of @xmath2 while the @xmath1-ray data gives @xmath3 .",
    "there is no evidence for color evolution between 8.5 hours and 5.5 days after the burst .",
    "we find an extragalactic extinction of @xmath227 along the line of sight to the burst .",
    "our data suggest that this dust has an smc extinction law but we are not able to constrain its redshift .",
    "the spectral slopes have been combined with the observed @xmath73-band optical decay to determine that the shocked electrons are in the slow cooling regime with an electron index of @xmath179 , and that the burst occurred in an ism that is homogeneous on scales larger than approximately @xmath7 cm .",
    "our data are consistent with an optical decay of @xmath225 at @xmath228 days after the burst , and @xmath229 after that .",
    "there is evidence that the transition between the early and late decay slopes occurred over a period of approximately one day .",
    "this is consistent with a sideways expanding jet that slows to a lorentz factor of @xmath230 approximately six days after the burst .",
    "the total gamma - ray energy in the burst was @xmath231  erg .",
    "the ambient density around is consistent with what is seen around other grbs ( @xmath216 @xmath9 ) and with densities seen in supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "the rapid localization of and the near - continuous monitoring of its oa from approximately ten minutes after the burst occurred has allowed this burst to be studied in unprecedented detail .",
    "the afterglow shows a large increase in luminosity approximately 2.5 hours after the burst and a possible second , smaller increase at @xmath232 day . both of these features would have been missed if optical follow - up had not been immediate and continuous .",
    "further , if the oa had not been identified until more than approximately three hours after the burst the true nature of the early - time slope would not have been known .",
    "demonstrates the need for continuous early - time monitoring of grb oas .",
