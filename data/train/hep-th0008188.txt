    "there has been tremendous interest over the last year in schemes for dimensional reduction where ordinary matter fields are confined to a lower - dimensional hypersurface , while only gravitational fields propagate throughout all of spacetime .",
    "such speculation has been inspired by recent developments in string / m - theory where gauge - fields can be associated with the degrees of freedom of open strings whose end - points live on a d - brane hypersurface , while gravitational fields associated with closed string excitations , can propagate in the bulk  @xcite . in particular randall and sundrum  @xcite proposed a static model where four - dimensional newtonian gravity is recovered at low energies when considering linear perturbations about a minkowski brane embedded in five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime ( ads@xmath0 ) .",
    "randall and sundrum  @xcite considered pure 5-d einstein gravity in the bulk , sourced only by a cosmological constant , whereas in a string theory or m - theory context one would also expect scalar fields , associated with the many moduli fields , in the gravitational sector , which should , in principle , also be allowed to propagate in the bulk  @xcite . for example , lukas , ovrut and waldram  @xcite have derived an effective five - dimensional action from a dimensional reduction from 11-dimensional m - theory which contains scalar fields in the bulk which correspond to moduli associated with the compactification of six - dimensions on a calabi - yau space .    a particularly elegant way to study the effective four - dimensional gravity induced in so - called ` brane world ' models",
    "was proposed by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki  @xcite .",
    "they derived the effective ` einstein equations ' for the induced 4-d metric obtained by projecting the five - dimensional metric onto the brane world - volume .",
    "this approach yields the most general form of the four - dimensional gravitational field equations for a brane world observer whatever the form of the bulk metric , in contrast to the usual kaluza - klein style dimensional reduction which relies on taking a particular form for the bulk metric in order to integrate over the fifth dimension .",
    "the price to be paid for such generality , is that the brane world observer may be subject to influences from the bulk , in particular gravitational waves , which are not constrained by local quantities , i.e. , the set of four - dimensional equations does not in general form a closed system .",
    "nonetheless , when the brane is located at an orbifold fixed point under @xmath1 symmetry ( a `` brane at the end of the world '' ) the energy - momentum tensor on the brane is sufficient to determine the extrinsic curvature of the brane , and together with the local induced metric , this strongly constrains the brane world gravity . in the absence of bulk matter",
    ", the effect of the bulk gravity can be described by the projected five - dimensional weyl tensor . in many circumstances ( e.g. , ads@xmath0 bulk ) this",
    "can be consistently set to zero .    in this paper",
    "we will extend the work of shiromizu , maeda and sasaki  @xcite to consider a simple dilaton - gravity theory with scalar and tensor fields which propagate in the bulk , with self - interaction potentials for the scalar field in the bulk and on the brane",
    ". we will give the general form for the effective scalar field and einstein equations on the brane , in particular giving expressions for the effective gravitational newton s constant , and the cosmological constant on the brane , both of which become functions of the local scalar field .",
