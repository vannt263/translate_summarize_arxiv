    "although supernova remnants ( snr ) are often invoked as the source of cosmic rays ( cr ) , of energy below the ` knee ' at about 3 pev , @xcite , there are still a number of imponderables . here",
    ", we concentrate on two aspects : + ( i ) sn energies are not unique , but have a certain frequency distribution involving some super - supernovae @xcite . we refer to this model as ssnr .",
    "+ ( ii ) snr in the galaxy are not distributed at random , but rather in clusters , in both space and time and , preferentially , in spiral arms @xcite .",
    "this is nsnr model (  normal snr  ) .    in our previous work @xcite",
    "we used the acceleration model of @xcite , which assumed that particles are trapped for up to @xmath1 after the sn explosion and that sn occurred randomly in time in the galaxy ( at an average rate of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the distribution in space was drawn from the usual average radially symmetrical distribution of sn surface density , with a peak at a galactocentric distance of d=4 kpc and falling rapidly with increasing d in the vicinity of the sun (  at d=8.5   kpc  ) . here",
    ", we go on to make allowance for the clustering of the sn - and hence the snr - in various ways , and , separately , consider a frequency distribution of sn energies : the ssnr model .    the quantity used as",
    "an indicator of cr intensity in the galaxy is the gamma ray intensity @xcite which has been measured as a function of longitude , latitude and gamma ray energy .",
    "most of the present work relates to gamma rays above 1 gev which are considered to be produced predominantly by cr nuclei ( mainly protons ) of median energy @xmath3 40 gev @xcite . in zeroth order of accuracy ,",
    "the mean cr intensity along a particular line of sight ( @xmath4 ) is simply proportional to the measured gamma ray intensity divided by the column density of target gas . in the actual analysis we use a more elaborate method but",
    "the basis is the same .",
    "the method is to study the ratio of the observed gamma ray intensity to the large scale average and use that as an indicator of the small scale variability of cr intensity from place to place .",
    "the variability can then be compared with that predicted by models involving sn , clustered and unclustered , normal and with different energies , using the same technique of comparing the intensity with the average .",
    "figure 1 gives an example of the data (  from @xcite  ) ; it refers to gamma rays with energy above 1 gev and having @xmath5 , i.e. , it relates to the galactic plane .",
    "identified discrete sources have been removed and the workers estimate that less than 10% of the remaining flux is due to unresolved sources .",
    "[ fig : grsky1 ]    we have used the basic data for the numbers of gamma rays to evaluate the statistical uncertainty in the individual intensities .",
    "the data have been divided into ` inner ' ( @xmath6 ) and ` outer ' ( @xmath7 ) , the innermost region ( @xmath8 ) being omitted because of confusion there .",
    "two latitude ranges are considered : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the gamma rays from the individual @xmath11- and @xmath12-ranges are derived from regions of the galaxy distributed along the line of sight but we can identify a median d - value for each range . restricting attention to gamma ray production in molecular clouds with the scale height of @xmath13 pc ,",
    "the corresponding distances are @xmath33 kpc and 1 kpc from the sun , for @xmath9 and @xmath14 respectively . allowing for production in @xmath15 , with its greater scale height",
    ", the d - values will be somewhat different (  but by not much because more of the gas - associated fluctuations arise from the clumpy @xmath16 rather than @xmath15  ) .",
    "the ` figure of merit ' adopted is the ratio of the observed gamma ray intensity to the smoothed line through the points (  9-degree polynomial , equivalent , approximately , to a smoothing over a 20@xmath17 longitudinal bin for the inner and outer galaxy regions , separately  ) .",
    "the shape of the line is determined essentially by the kiloparsec - scale spatial variations of the cosmic ray intensity and the target gas .",
    "figure 1 gives the smoothed curve for @xmath5 .",
    "the ratios have been determined for various bins of longitude , @xmath18 , specifically , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "figure 2 shows the corresponding frequency distributions of the differences between the egret data and the fit .",
    "the numbers of entries , the means and the rms ( @xmath21 ) values are given in table 1 .",
    "it is with the latter rms values that we are mainly concerned .",
    "the numbers of entries , the means and the rms ( @xmath21 ) values are given in table 1.,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=264 ] -values .",
    "the numbers of entries , the means and the rms ( @xmath21 ) values are given in table 1.,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=264 ]    [ fig : grsky2 ]    the appropriate @xmath22-value to be used is a compromise between the @xmath23 over which intensity changes are expected ( all values but with a bias towards degree scales ) and the need to get away from small @xmath23-values , where bin - to - bin correlations are serious , because of the finite range of latitudes ( @xmath9 ) over which the averaging is made .",
    "we consider that @xmath24 is most appropriate and this will be used in the model calculations .",
    "figure 3 gives the values of @xmath25 for the observed data (  after correction for noise  ) and for various model calculations , to be described shortly .",
    "the values are plotted at increasing ( from left to right ) distances from the galactic centre of the median gamma ray production regions .      in all our models",
    "the radial distribution of gas has axial symmetry .",
    "it means that for a smooth non - fluctuating cr distribution the longitudinal distribution of the gamma - ray intensity has also to be smooth .",
    "however , we know that the ism is highly non - uniform and this non - uniformity will contribute to the fine structure of the gamma - ray intensity profile .",
    "a number of facts are relevant , as follows : + ( i ) the large scale dependence of _",
    "n(h ) _ on _ l _ is automatically included through the radial distribution .",
    "+ ( ii ) the 9-degree polynomial fit causes changes on scales of about @xmath26 (  and above  ) to be allowed for .",
    "+ ( iii ) much of the clumpiness of the gas in the ism comes from molecular clouds and we allow for correlation between the snr and the clouds in the analysis .",
    "+ ( iv ) results of the type shown in figure 2 show a dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 which is very similar for all the models and the observed values .",
    "although the implication of the above is that the effect of the fluctuations in @xmath29 (  both atomic and molecular  ) is not likely to be dramatic , it is certainly finite .",
    "its magnitude will be greatest in the inner galaxy at low latitudes , @xmath30 , where contributions from the far inner galaxy are important .",
    "estimate for both the inner and outer regions have been made . for @xmath31",
    "the estimated value of the logarithmic standard deviation is 0.027 using the well known column densities of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath32 , data @xcite give a value 0.026 referred to the whole column density (  @xmath33  ) , leading to an overall value of @xmath34 = 0.037 .",
    "comparison can be made with the observed value of @xmath35 for this @xmath36 region : 0.080 .",
    "subtraction in quadrature leads to @xmath22 = 0.071 , i.e. a small , but finite reduction .",
    "support for our analysis comes from a study of the egret observations and analysis published prior to the latest observations used by us @xcite . in this work",
    ", predictions were made for a model in which the column densities of gas were used together with an inferred cr intensity distribution which was correlated with the volume density of gas (  derived from the column density and assumed rotation curve  ) but smoothed spatially at the _ kpc _ level .",
    "the majority of the excursions in predicted intensity were thus due to the gas column density variations alone .",
    "the fluctuations of the observed intensities (  @xmath37  ) about the prediction have @xmath38 .",
    "this value is quite consistent with ours .    turning to regions away from the galactic plane in the inner galaxy (  @xmath39  ) the corresponding value for @xmath15 and @xmath40 is @xmath41 . in the outer galaxy",
    "the values are @xmath42 for @xmath30 and 0.035 for @xmath43 .",
    "it will be noticed that in all cases the corrections will be small .",
    "our contention is that the major cause of the fluctuations in gamma - ray intensity on the @xmath44 scale is the stochastic nature of the snr in space and time and , probably , in energy output .",
    "the column density of gas undoubtedly fluctuates with _",
    "l _ but the observed gamma - ray intensity fluctuations are much greater because of the cr intensity variations along the line of sight .",
    "-values ) of gamma ray intensities about the best - fit : ( a ) - normal diffusion , ( b ) - anomalous diffusion .",
    "small downward corrections have been applied to the obs (  observed  ) -values to allow for experimental noise .",
    "model simulations are : nc - non - clustering , c - clustering , ssnr - with a frequency distribution of energies .",
    "mean standard deviations are obtained by averaging 4 - 8 independent samples .",
    "errors are not indicated for clarity of the figures , but the distribution of @xmath22 for different samples is broad due to the stochastic nature of sn explosions .",
    "typical errors for anomalous diffusion are 0.002-(nc ) , 0.0015-(c ) and 0.014-(ssnr ) for the inner galaxy , 0.004-(nc ) , 0.004-(c ) and 0.02-(ssnr ) for the outer galaxy . for normal diffusion",
    "the errors are by 2 - 5 times less .",
    "the galactocentric distances are the means from which much of the gamma ray intensities are derived.,width=291,height=317 ]    [ fig : grsky3 ]      our usual model @xcite comprises cr production by snr , as described in paragraph 1 , and propagation with ` anomalous diffusion ' .",
    "the snr were assumed to be all identical and independent in time and space (  i.e. nsnr  ) , within the constraints of the dependence of the mean snr density on galactocentric radius .",
    "we denote this as nc (  non - clustering  ) , and the results for this situation are shown in figure 3 .",
    "this is the nsnr model , but with no clustering .",
    "the ssnr model has the same _ mean _ energy content per snr as in the previous case but a distribution of energies about the mean , with a frequence distribution of _ log energy _ having a _ log standard deviation _ of 1.2 , following @xcite .",
    "the results for this type of super - supernovae are now indicated as ssnr in figure 3 .    turning to the possibility of the clustering of nsn",
    ", our clustering model has the following idealised form . at any one place there are sn in sets of 10 , distributed at random , in time , over @xmath45 . the results for this model `",
    "c ' (  clustered  ) , are also shown in figure 3 . here",
    ", the sn are identical .",
    "finally , calculations have been made for the same situation , as indicated , for normal diffusion ( nd ) rather than standard : anomalous diffusion.        it is apparent that the observed @xmath22 values are higher than expected for the nsn model without clustering - i.e. non - clustering ( nc ) .",
    "for normal diffusion nc(nd ) the discrepancy is bigger still .",
    "below we examine various factors which influence our model predictions .",
    "the model predictions shown in figure 3 relate to primary protons .",
    "however , the observed gamma rays are produced by all cr nuclei , i.e. by the mixed primary mass composition .",
    "primary nuclei are more efficient in producing gamma rays than protons of the same energy per particle due to the higher interaction cross - section and higher number of interacting nucleons in the collision . at the same time fluctuations of the gamma - ray intensity created by cr nuclei",
    "are lower than those for protons , therefore our model predictions should be reduced for the mixed primary mass composition .",
    "we calculated the fluctuations for the mixed composition with relative abundances equal to 0.416 for protons , 0.265 for helium , 0.170 for cno group , 0.149 for iron group of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the result is that we have to multiply our predicted @xmath22-values by 0.93 , 0.86 , 0.85 , 0.88 respectively for the increasing galactocentric distances indicated in figure 3 .",
    "the uncertainty of this correction is within the range of 0.005 - 0.019 . as a result of the correction",
    "the discrepancy between observed and expected @xmath22-values for the non - clustering case ( nc ) with a mixed primary mass composition is bigger still .",
    "it is relevant to examine the question of normal or anomalous diffusion ? .",
    "the mode of diffusion has obvious implications for the present work .",
    "calculations have been made for all cases , i.e. non - clustering , clustering and ssnr models using normal diffusion , instead of anomalous .",
    "the result is that the fluctuations and @xmath22-values are lower for normal diffusion in all cases (  see figure 3a compared with figure 3b  ) , thus the difference between the non - clustering case and observations will be even larger .",
    "examination of figure 3 shows that the @xmath22-values for ssnr with a distribution of explosion energies is higher than for clustering ( c ) and for the observed fluctuations ( obs ) .",
    "it is due to the basic assumption about the fluctuations of the explosion energy",
    ". added to the fluctuations caused by the stochastic distribution of sn in space and time these fluctuations result in a rise of the total fluctuations .",
    "inevitably , it is possible to dilute the ssnr values by assuming that only a fraction of the snr are of such high energy .",
    "according to @xcite the fraction of such ssnr is equal to 0.2 for snibc and 0.1 for sniin , but we regard it as a quantity to be determined.      although at first sight the case for some clustering of snr at all distances is strong there is a complication that must be allowed for .",
    "this concerns the correlation of snr with target gas , particularly in molecular form (  principally @xmath16  ) .",
    "this correlation is on linear scales smaller than the kpc - scale already allowed for .",
    "our @xmath0 bin of longitude would correspond to a linear scale of 280  pc at a distance of 4 kpc (  the typical distance to the production region in the inner galaxy for @xmath9  ) .",
    "such a distance would embrace likely distances of molecular clouds ( mc ) from some , at least , of the snr .",
    "the magnitude of this correlation is not clear but some progress can be made .",
    "the list of known snr @xcite has only 3% of the entries mentioning adjacent mc but this fraction will increase with increasing snr - mc distance .",
    "inspection of the galactic maps of mc @xcite in the inner galaxy shows a mean separation of about 500pc ; thus a correlation factor of about 0.5 would appear to be indicated . for the general case",
    ", it appears that the relation between the various quantities for the situation where there is partial clustering of the sn (  coefficient @xmath46  ) and a partial correlation between snr and molecular gas (  coefficient 0.5  ) is :    @xmath47+\\delta(r_{ssnr}\\sigma_{ssnr})^2\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ + g[(1-\\delta)\\frac{r_{c}\\sigma_c^2+r_{nc}\\sigma_{nc}^2}{2}+\\delta(r_{ssnr}\\sigma_{ssnr})^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the total , observed ( corrected ) standard deviation , @xmath34 characterizes the fluctuations of the column density of the gas (  as deived in  3.2  ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the expectations for non - clustering , clustering and ssnr models respectively and the mixed primary mass composition , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 - ratios of the model to the observed gamma - ray intensities for the same three models , @xmath54 is the fraction of gas in molecular form and @xmath55 is the fraction of ssnr among the total snr . the first term on the _ rhs _ of equation ( 1 ) relates to snr in the ordinary interstellar medium , the second term - to snr inside mc .",
    "the equation satisfies the lower limit @xmath56    in the calculations it is assumed that ssnr are so rare that they are not clustered , whereas half of the ordinary snr ( nc ) are clustered in mc .",
    "the values of @xmath54 are , for the approximate median d - values relating to figure 3 : 0.5 , 0.3 , 0.1 and 0.1 .",
    "in fact , different models give different absolute gamma - ray intensities , but they can be easily normalised to the experimental data multiplying the explosion energy by a constant .",
    "the value of relative fluctuations @xmath22 in this operation remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , we adopted all @xmath57 .",
    "the fraction @xmath46 is therefore the only unknown variable and it can be calculated from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 4 .    ) and anomalous (  @xmath58  ) diffusion and for 3 ssnr fractions : ( a ) - @xmath59 , ( b ) - @xmath60 , ( c ) - @xmath61 .",
    "the lines connecting the points are 3-degree polynomial fits to the data .",
    "the abscissae for the two curves are slightly displaced with respect to each other to avoid an overlap of the errors . for @xmath62 , the first point",
    "(  extreme left  ) for anomalous diffusion is at @xmath63.,width=291,height=283 ]    [ fig : grsky4 ]",
    "the situations for the two models can be considered in turn .    for the nsnr model , the model used by us in much of our work , considerable clustering",
    "is needed in the inner galaxy .",
    "indeed , with @xmath64 the clustering must exceed that adopted by us , viz .",
    "10 sn per @xmath65 coincident in position .",
    "although not impossible , it is unlikely that the necessary higher number (  20 - 30 ?  ) is present , even in the congested region of the giant molecular ring at @xmath66 .",
    "instead , we incline towards the ssnr model . inspection of figures 4b and 4c shows that in the important inner galaxy region , with @xmath67 , the bulk of the work is done by ssnr and little by snr .",
    "a value of @xmath55 in the range 0.15 to 0.2 is indicated , with 0.15 being more physical . in the outer galaxy ,",
    "the likely range is 0.0 to 0.15 .",
    "certainly , the values of @xmath46 shown in figure 4 have big systematic and statistical errors due mainly to the simplified model of clustering and big fluctuations caused by the stochastic nature of sn explosions .",
    "the estimates of these errors are indicated in figure 4 .",
    "the fluctuations in the intensity of gamma rays above 1 gev in and near the galactic plane give information about the mode of production of cosmic rays in their sources , and their mode of propagation .",
    "we have adopted alternative models of both sources ( supernovae of a variety of energies and sn of unique energy but with varying degrees of clustering ) and diffusion ( our standard anomalous diffusion , and normal ) . for normal diffusion , although at @xmath68 5.5 and 11.5 kpc it is possible to achieve reasonable results , for @xmath69 kpc (  the region nearest the sun  ) this is not possible .",
    "whatever the value of @xmath55 , the fractions are unreasonably high .",
    "perhaps this argument can be used to point against normal diffusion being applicable for cr of the energies in question ?",
    "bearing in mind our general arguments that clustering is more common in the inner galaxy it would appear that @xmath70 0.15 is favoured (  figure 4b  ) .",
    "we would then have a constant fraction of sn of the ssn variety , with none of them clustered , but the normal sn clustered only in the solar vicinity and the inner galaxy .",
    "it seems that the solution put forward is astrophysically reasonable , for the following reasons . concerning standard snr ,",
    "these come from stars of modest mass produced in molecular clouds .",
    "these clouds are composed of individual clumps in which star production (  and subsequent sn  ) occurs . in the inner galaxy , where the overall mc masses are bigger @xcite there will be more clusters than in the outer . for ssn ,",
    "the fractional number per clump of the required massive progenitor stars is probably the same in the inner and outer galaxy . in view of continuing problems with theories of star formation [  t.j.millar , private communication  ]",
    "even this conclusion can not be regarded as completely firm .    as for the uhecr connection figure 5",
    "shows the energy spectra of cr created by ssnr .",
    "the distribution of their explosion energies and maximum energies of accelerated cr , taken from @xcite and used in our analysis , gives the possibility to accelerate particles up to ultra - high energies of about @xmath71 gev .",
    "so our preferred explanation of large fluctuations for the gamma - ray intensity has an additional advantage to include the possible origin of uhecr .",
