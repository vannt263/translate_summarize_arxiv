    "* there might be contributions from yet to be discovered @xmath139 or @xmath140 decays , which would ease the `` gap problem '' .",
    "such decays have not been observed yet and we did not investigate them in our analysis since our general findings do not prefer large contributions from high - mass states like @xmath141 or from non - resonant decays @xmath136 so that we do nt expect significant contributions from @xmath139 or @xmath140 decays either .",
    "moreover , by adding too many free parameters to the problem our analysis would loose in sensitivity .",
    "kinematical distributions of the lepton energy @xmath142 and the hadronic invariant mass @xmath143 measured in inclusive @xmath4 decays are sensitive to the composition of exclusive final states containing mesons with charm .",

    "@xcite ) with highest precision . in this paper",
    ", we make use of such moment measurements to fit exclusive branching fractions @xmath145 with the aim to shed additional light on a solution to the puzzles described above . we investigate the contributions to the inclusive branching fraction from exclusive final states @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53",

    "therefore , branching - fraction values found by the fit being larger than the directly measured values may indicate that the @xmath149 decay branching - fractions assumed are overestimated .    in section  [ sec:1 ] , we describe the moments entering our analysis as fit inputs .",

    "we outline the fit procedure and its validation , and we present the fit results in section  [ sec:4 ] . in the last section we give a summary .",

    "+ again , these moments are written in form of a vector : @xmath173 whereby the vector of central moments with respect to @xmath174 is defined analogously @xmath175 * in ref .",
    "@xcite a measurement of combined mass - energy moments was proposed .",
    "these moments are for instance better controlled theoretically and therefore they may result in a more reliable extraction of higher - order non - pertubative hqe parameters .",
    "hence , a more accurate determination of the standard model parameters @xmath24 , the charm quark mass @xmath176 and the bottom quark mass @xmath177 should be possible .",

    "therefore , the qualitative picture does not change and we conclude that neglecting the correlations between mass and mass - energy moments are of minor importance . * the sensitivity of the fit with respect to the modeling of @xmath300 decays is checked by varying the mixture of @xmath301 and @xmath302 final states : for the extreme case that only @xmath233 is simulated to predict the moments for @xmath300 , none of the fit results for any branching fraction changes more than @xmath303 with respect to the associated fit error . for the case",

    "then , random vectors @xmath318 are added , where @xmath319 is defined by @xmath320 and @xmath321 is a standard normal distributed random vector . since the theoretical exclusive moment vectors are also only known within statistical uncertainties due to the limited monte - carlo statistics , they are varied in an analogous way .",
