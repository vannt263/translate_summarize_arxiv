    "this paper investigates the connection between symplectic geometry and those parts of representation theory which revolve around the notion of categorification .",
    "the existence of such a connection , in an abstract sense , follows from simple general ideas .",
    "the difficult thing is to make it explicit . on the symplectic side ,",
    "the tools needed for a systematic study of this question are not yet fully available .",
    "therefore we concentrate on a single example , which is just complicated enough to indicate the depth of the relationship .",
    "the results can be understood by themselves , but a glimpse of the big picture certainly helps to explain them , and that is what the present section is for .",
    "let @xmath5 be a category .",
    "action of a group @xmath6 on @xmath5 _ is a family @xmath7 of functors from @xmath5 to itself , such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 for all @xmath10 ; here @xmath11 denotes isomorphism of functors on @xmath12 a full - fledged action comes with preferred isomorphisms @xmath9 that satisfy obvious compatibility relations . ] .",
    "we will not distinguish between two actions @xmath13 and @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "a particularly nice situation is when @xmath5 is triangulated and the @xmath17 are exact functors .",
    "then the action induces a linear representation of @xmath6 on the grothendieck group @xmath18 .",
    "the inverse process , in which one lifts a given linear representation to a group action on a triangulated category , is called categorification ( of group representations ) .    the connection with symplectic geometry is based on an idea of donaldson .",
    "he proposed ( in talks circa @xmath19 ) to associate to a compact symplectic manifold @xmath20 a category @xmath21 whose objects are lagrangian submanifolds @xmath22 , and whose morphisms are the floer cohomology groups @xmath23 .",
    "the composition of morphisms would be given by products @xmath24 which are defined , for example , in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be the group of symplectic automorphisms of @xmath26 .",
    "any @xmath27 determines a family of isomorphisms @xmath28 for @xmath29 which are compatible with the products . in other words",
    ", @xmath30 induces an equivalence @xmath31 from @xmath21 to itself .",
    "this is just a consequence of the fact that @xmath21 is an object of symplectic geometry , hence natural under symplectic maps .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath32 , so that all symplectic vector fields are hamiltonian .",
    "then a smooth isotopy of symplectic automorphisms @xmath33 gives rise to distinguished elements in @xmath34 for all @xmath35 this means that the @xmath31 define a canonical action of the symplectic mapping class group @xmath36 on @xmath21 . as a consequence , any symplectic fibre bundle with fibre @xmath37 and base @xmath38 gives rise to a @xmath39-action on @xmath21 , through the monodromy map @xmath40 .",
    "interesting examples can be obtained from families of smooth complex projective varieties .    while it is thus easy to construct potentially interesting group actions on the categories @xmath21 , both the group actions and the categories themselves are difficult to understand .",
    "a particularly intriguing question is whether , in any given case , one can relate them to objects defined in a purely algebraic way . in homological algebra there is a standard technique for approaching similar comparison problems ( an example is beilinson s work @xcite on coherent sheaves on @xmath41 ) .",
    "a very crude attempt to adapt this technique to our situation goes like this : pick a finite number of lagrangian submanifolds @xmath42 which , for some reason , appear to be particularly important . using the product on floer cohomology , turn @xmath43 into a ring .",
    "now associate to an arbitrary lagrangian submanifold @xmath44 the @xmath45-module @xmath46 .",
    "this defines a functor from @xmath21 to the category of @xmath45-modules .",
    "as it stands the functor is not particularly useful , since it does not take into account all the available structure .    to begin with ,",
    "floer cohomology groups are graded , and hence @xmath45 is a graded ring ( depending on @xmath26 , this may be only a @xmath47-grading for some finite @xmath48 ) . to make more substantial progress one needs to refine the category @xmath21 .",
    "this theory is as yet under construction , and we can only give a vague outline of it .",
    "as pointed out by fukaya @xcite , working directly with the floer cochain complexes should enable one to construct an @xmath49-category underlying @xmath21 .",
    "kontsevich @xcite suggested to consider the derived category of this @xmath49-category .",
    "this `` derived fukaya category '' is expected to be triangulated , and to contain @xmath21 as a full subcategory ; we denote it by @xmath50 ( which is an abuse of notation ) .",
    "the action of @xmath36 on @xmath21 should extend to an action on @xmath50 by exact functors .",
    "moreover , it seems natural to suppose that the grothendieck group of @xmath50 is related to @xmath51 ; that would mean that the group actions coming from families of projective varieties could be considered as categorifications of the classical monodromy representations .",
    "returning to the rings , one expects to get from fukaya s construction a canonical ( up to quasi - isomorphism ) @xmath49-algebra @xmath52 with cohomology @xmath45 .",
    "the functor introduced above would lift to an @xmath49-functor from the @xmath49-category underlying @xmath21 to the @xmath49-category of @xmath49-modules over @xmath52 . in a second step , this would induce an exact functor @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the derived category of @xmath49-modules .",
    "a standard argument based on exactness indicates that this functor , when restricted to the triangulated subcategory of @xmath50 generated by @xmath55 , would be full and faithful .",
    "this is a much stronger comparison theorem than one could get with the primitive approach which we had mentioned first .",
    "we will not say more about this ; what the reader should keep in mind is the expected importance of the rings @xmath45 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that there is a special reason to study actions of braid groups and mapping class groups on categories . in 19921994",
    "a number of mathematicians independently suggested extending the formalism of tqfts to manifolds with corners .",
    "while three - dimensional extended tqfts are rather well understood , there has been much less progress in the four - dimensional case .",
    "part of the data which make up a four - dimensional extended tqft are categories @xmath56 associated to closed surfaces @xmath57 ; these would govern the process of cutting and pasting for the vector spaces associated to closed three - manifolds .",
    "the mapping class group of @xmath57 should act on @xmath56 in a natural way , and for interesting tqfts this action is likely to be highly nontrivial . as a matter of historical interest , we note that the categories @xmath21 were invented by donaldson in an attempt to make gauge theory fit into the extended tqft formalism ; see @xcite for more recent developments .",
    "there is a version of this for invariants of two - knots , where the categories are associated to punctured discs and carry actions of the braid groups .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite go some way towards constructing such extended tqfts in a representation - theoretic way .      in the algebraic part of the paper , we study the derived categories @xmath58 for a particular family @xmath0 ( @xmath59 ) of graded rings .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 starts with the quiver ( oriented graph ) @xmath60 shown in figure  [ fig : quiver ] , whose vertices are labelled @xmath61 . recall that the path ring of an arbitrary quiver @xmath62 is the abelian group freely generated by the set of all paths in @xmath62 , with multiplication given by composition .",
    "paths of length @xmath63 in @xmath60 correspond to @xmath64-tuples @xmath65 of numbers @xmath66 such that the difference of any two consecutive ones is @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the path ring of @xmath60 is the abelian group freely generated by such @xmath64-tuples for all @xmath68 , with the multiplication @xmath69 the paths @xmath70 of length zero are mutually orthogonal idempotents , and their sum is the unit element .",
    "we make the path ring of @xmath60 into a graded ring by setting @xmath71 and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 , and extending this in the obvious way ( this is _ not _ the same as the grading by lengths of paths ) . finally , @xmath0 is the quotient of the path ring of @xmath60 by the relations @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "these relations are homogeneous with respect to the above grading , so that @xmath0 is a graded ring . as an abelian group",
    "@xmath0 is free and of finite rank ; a basis is given by the @xmath76 elements @xmath77 .",

    "one can cure this problem by using kontsevich s idea of graded lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "we will not state the corresponding improved version of corollary [ th : comparison ] explicitly , but it can easily be extracted from our proof . note that if one looks at the graded groups @xmath184 in isolation , they appear to depend on @xmath128 in a complicated way ; whereas the connection with the bigraded group makes this dependence quite transparent .",
    "one can see this collapsing of the bigrading on a much simpler level , which corresponds to passing to euler characteristics on both sides in corollary [ th : comparison ] .",
    "namely , the representation of the braid group on @xmath185 induced by @xmath158 is the specialization @xmath186 of the burau representation .",
    "while our proof of corollary [ th : comparison ] is by dimension counting , it is natural to ask whether there are canonical homomorphisms between the two graded groups ; these should be compatible with the product structures existing on both sides .",
    "unfortunately , the techniques used here are not really suitable for that ; while an inspection of our argument suggests a possible definition of a homomorphism in , showing that it is independent of the various choices involved would be extremely complicated . and there is no easy way to adapt the proof of theorem [ th : gin - two ] to include a description of the product on floer cohomology .",
    "it seems that to overcome these problems , one would have to use a more abstract approach , in line with the general picture of section [ subsec : generalities ] . while the details of this are far from clear , an outline can easily be provided , and we will do that now .",

    "from the way in which @xmath190 intersect each other , and standard properties of floer cohomology , one can see that @xmath191 ( actually , this was the starting point of our work ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the @xmath49-algebra of floer cochain complexes underlying the right hand side should be formal ( see @xcite for much more about this ) , which would make its derived category of @xmath49-modules equivalent to @xmath189 . as mentioned in section [ subsec",

    "it is natural to conjecture that the exact functor should intertwine the two actions . this would imply corollary [ th : comparison ] , in a stronger form which repairs the deficiencies mentioned above .",
