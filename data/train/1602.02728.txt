    "gamma - ray astronomy covers observations of photons with energies above a few 100  kev , with current instruments reaching up to about 100  tev .",
    "formally , there is no upper energy limit to gamma rays , yet pair - production on background photons will effectively set a horizon to the explorable universe . for photon energies above @xmath0  pev",
    "this horizon is of the size of our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "gamma rays interact with the earth s atmosphere , hence their direct detection from the terrestrial surface is not possible .",
    "gamma rays are thus either observed directly from space using detectors aboard satellites or stratospheric balloons , or indirectly from ground by detecting the electromagnetic cascades that are generated by gamma - ray induced pair production in the earth atmosphere .",
    "gamma - ray instruments comprise coded - mask telescopes for the low - energy range ( e.g.  integral  @xcite ) , compton telescopes for the medium - energy range ( e.g.  comptel  @xcite ) , pair creation telescopes for the high - energy range ( e.g.  fermi  @xcite , agile  @xcite ) , cherenkov telescopes for the very - high - energy range ( e.g.  h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic  @xcite , veritas  @xcite , milagro  @xcite ) , and charged particle detectors or integrating non - imaging cherenkov detectors for the ultra - high - energy range ( e.g.  airobicc  @xcite ) . for a review of these detection techniques ,",
    "see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "detection of the first celestial gamma - ray sources has been achieved in the late 1950ies in the low - energy domain  @xcite , in the early 1960ies in the medium - energy  @xcite and high - energy domains  @xcite , and in the late 1980ies in the very - high - energy domain  @xcite . since then",
    ", improvements in instrumental performances have differed between domains , with the most spectacular results achieved so far in the high - energy range that today has an inventory of over 3000 steady sources of gamma rays  @xcite .",
    "progress has also been impressive in the very - high - energy domain , with well over 100 confirmed sources .",
    "the low- and medium - energy gamma - ray domains have so far not experienced a comparable development , the number of few 100 kev and mev steady sources being of the order of several tens .",
    "no gamma - ray source has so far been detected in the ultra - high - energy range , in the domain above @xmath1  tev .",
    "the common feature of all gamma - ray sources is the non - thermal nature of the underlying emission processes .",
    "as opposed to thermal radiation that originates from the random movements of particles in matter with temperature above absolute zero , non - thermal radiation may have a variety of origins : the decay or de - excitation of atomic nuclei , the decay of particles or their annihilation with antiparticles , and the interaction of non - thermal particle populations with photons and matter .",
    "these processes may either lead to emission of mono - energetic photons or to emission of a broad - band continuum spectrum of photons , covering eventually the full electromagnetic spectrum from the radio band to the gamma - ray domain . within that spectrum ,",
    "the gamma - ray band is unique since it is free from concurrent thermal radiation that dilutes the non - thermal radiation at lower energies . in other words ,",
    "gamma rays provide the clearest view on the non - thermal physics in our universe , and for decay , de - excitation and annihilation processes they often provide the only view .",
    "gamma - ray astronomy is thus the astronomy of the non - thermal universe . since its advent about 50 years ago it has revealed an unexpected variety of objects that release a significant , sometimes even dominant fraction of their energy through non - thermal processes , including amongst others neutron stars , black holes , stellar explosions and their remnants .",
    "the exploratory phase is certainly concluded for the high - energy and very - high - energy range , which now will turn into mature fields of contemporary astronomy that will deepen our understanding of the underlying physics . for the low- and medium - energy domains , exploration has only started , and an important step needs to be taken to bring the non - thermal phenomenologies into light .",
    "the ultra - high - energy domain is still terra incognita , but instruments exist that could soon reveal first sources , provided that some exist within the accessible universe  @xcite .",
    "this review aims to depict the evolution of the field of gamma - ray astronomy in the foreseeable future , based on recent achievements , open science questions , and ongoing instrument developments .",
    "the review will concentrate on the high - energy and very - high - energy range , which currently are the most vital domains . specifically",
    ", the review will discuss future instruments ( or instrument concepts ) that are able to detect gamma rays in the 100  mev to 100  tev energy range , although some of the discussed instruments will explore the sky beyond this band .",
    "the nature of dark matter is certainly one of the most fundamental problems of modern science .",
    "evidenced as apparently missing mass at scales of galaxies , galaxy clusters , but also the entire universe , it inevitably points us to a flaw in our understanding of nature .",
    "proposed solutions to this mystery comprise modifications to the fundamental laws of physics , as well as the introduction of new , weakly interacting particles that so far escaped detection .",
    "the most popular candidate for the latter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) that arise in extensions to the standard model of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "direct searches for wimps are currently performed in underground laboratories and using the large hadron collider , while indirect searches rely on the detection of annihilation and decay products that may lead to observable signatures in the gamma - ray domain  @xcite .",
    "less popular but not less interesting candidates comprise the axion that may leave an imprint on gamma - ray spectra of distant sources  @xcite .",
    "annihilation or decay of dark matter particles is expected to lead to gamma - ray continuum and line emission in the gev ",
    "tev domain  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent limits today come from the fermi - lat telescope which has ruled out the existence of wimp particles with masses @xmath2  gev  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are corroborated by recent upper limits obtained with the planck satellite on the maximum wimp annihilation cross section in the early universe  @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "existing upper limits are less constraining , and current measurements can not exclude the existence of wimp particles with masses above a few 10  gev .",
    "next generation very - high - energy telescopes will be decisive to probe wimp particles with higher masses .",
    "any detection would mark a historical scientific breakthrough , while an upper limit would put scientific constraints that will question the wimp interpretation of dark matter .",
    "whatever the outcome , future very - high - energy gamma - ray telescopes will change our understanding of the universe .",
    "since the discovery of cosmic rays at the beginning of the last century  @xcite , it has been established that the earth is immersed in a basically isotropic flow of high - energy particles , composed primarily of atomic nuclei and traces of electrons , positrons and antiprotons .",
    "particle energies span from a few 100  mev to beyond @xmath3  ev , with a differential energy spectrum following a power law that steepens at a few pev before flattening at about an eev and then turning over and terminating at a few 100  eev  @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that particles up to the `` knee '' at a few pev originate from sources within our galaxy , with the `` knee '' marking the end of the galactic proton spectrum  @xcite .",
    "there is rather convincing and yet circumstantial evidence that the bulk of the galactic cosmic rays are accelerated in supernova remnants ( snrs ) , though no proof has been found yet that snrs can accelerate cosmic rays up to the `` knee '' energy  @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of cosmic - ray protons and nuclei can be probed through observations of gamma rays resulting from the decay of secondary @xmath4-mesons produced in hadronic interactions , with the gamma - ray energy being roughly @xmath5 of the kinetic proton energy .",
    "detecting gamma rays up to 100  tev from a snr would unambiguously establish hadronic cosmic - ray acceleration to @xmath6pev energies since alternative emission channels , such as inverse compton scattering of high - energy leptons , are not believed to reach such high energies  @xcite .",
    "discovering such a galactic `` pevatron '' is without doubt the holy grail of very - high - energy gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "the enabling requirements for such a discovery are an improvement of the instrument sensitivity in the energy - range up to @xmath1  tev , a domain that is only poorly covered by existing instruments .    at low energies ( below a few gev ) , cosmic rays play a crucial role in the energetic balance of the interstellar medium and they are the primary driving agent of interstellar chemistry that ultimately produces the building blocks of life  @xcite .",
    "low - energy cosmic rays are however heavily affected by the solar wind , hence their spectrum and intensity escapes direct measurements .",
    "information can be indirectly inferred through ionisation rate measurements of the interstellar medium , suggesting for example an enhanced cosmic - ray ionisation rate in the vicinity of gamma - ray producing supernova remnants  @xcite .",
    "gamma rays can also be used directly to determine the spectrum of cosmic rays in interstellar space  @xcite , yet current instruments are lacking sufficient low - energy sensitivity ( below a few @xmath7  mev ) to provide stringent results .",
    "indirect measurements can be extended to lower cosmic - ray energies by observing gamma - ray lines in the mev domain that result from cosmic - ray induced excitation of atomic nuclei in the interstellar medium .",
    "so far , these lines escape detection due to a lack in sensitivity of current instrumentation , but they may be in reach of future medium - energy gamma - ray telescopes  @xcite . in summary , a next generation medium- to high - energy gamma - ray satellite should enable the exploration of the low - energy cosmic - ray component , shedding thus light on a crucial agent that is key to galactic physical and chemical processes .",
    "gamma rays not only carry information about the cosmic - ray intensity and spectrum , but also about the propagation physics . specifically ,",
    "if the mass of a molecular cloud is known , gamma - ray observations can be used to measure the cosmic - ray energy density and to infer its spatial variations due to cosmic - ray propagation  @xcite .",
    "for example , observations of tev gamma - ray emission from molecular clouds in the vicinity of snr  w28 suggest a reduced cosmic - ray diffusion coefficient with respect to the average galactic value , possibly due to the higher plasma turbulence around the remnant  @xcite .",
    "models predict a concave - shaped gamma - ray spectrum as result of the superposition of background cosmic rays with freshly accelerated nuclei that carries information about the diffusion properties of the interstellar medium  @xcite .",
    "current instruments are not sensitive enough to reveal the predicted signatures , but future very - high - energy gamma - ray facilities with improved sensitivity should allow inferring the properties of cosmic - ray propagation from the observations .",
    "cosmic - ray phenomena are not limited to the milky way , as illustrated by the observation of synchrotron emission from external galaxies attributed to cosmic - ray electrons interacting with magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "more recently , high - energy and very - high - energy gamma - ray emission has been observed from both local group and nearby starburst galaxies , which has been interpreted as cosmic - ray induced @xmath4-decay radiation  @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray observations of external galaxies provide the potential to study cosmic - ray acceleration and transport in various global conditions  @xcite , yet current instruments lack the sensitivity to clearly distinguish between the cosmic - ray induced and concurrent potential source components  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gamma - ray emission is generally not resolved , and even where spatial information is available ( as for example for the magellanic clouds ) , the limited angular resolutions of current instruments severely hampers the identification of cosmic - ray sources  @xcite .",
    "an improved sensitivity combined with an enhanced angular resolution is therefore mandatory to exploit the full potential of gamma - ray observations of external star - forming galaxies , and to learn about cosmic - ray physics in different galactic environments .      as testified by current gamma - ray observations ,",
    "particle acceleration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the universe .",
    "although the basic physical processes that can lead to particle acceleration are understood , the actual mechanism at operation in a specific source or the nature of the underlying source is often poorly known  @xcite .",
    "for example , the source of the highest energy cosmic rays is still elusive , and proposed origins include active galactic nuclei ( agn )  @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite , spinning magnetars  @xcite , and intergalactic shock fronts  @xcite .",
    "it is also not clear whether supernova remnant shocks are at the origin of particles of the cosmic - ray spectrum between the `` knee '' and the `` ankle '' , or whether larger shocks associated with supershells or a galactic wind termination shock are needed  @xcite .",
    "so far , only little evidence for particle acceleration in supershells exist , although recent high - energy  @xcite and very - high - energy  @xcite gamma - ray observations of the cygnus  x region show evidence for hadronic particle acceleration in the cygnus superbubble . to confirm this scenario , sensitive @xmath1  mev observations",
    "are needed to reveal the characteristic @xmath4 signature of hadronic emission . and deeper very - high - energy observations should clarify whether cygnus  x remains an exception , or whether other particle accelerating supershells exist within our galaxy or its neighbours  @xcite .",
    "new insights into the physics of particle acceleration have recently been gained through the study of gamma - ray variability .",
    "for example , agile and fermi - lat observations have revealed dramatic few hours long gamma - ray flares at a few 100 mev from the crab pulsar wind nebula that apparently have no counterpart in any other wavelength band ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the observations indicate very efficient particle acceleration going beyond the classical reaction limit in an mhd setting  @xcite .",
    "extremely rapid gamma - ray variability has also been observed from blazars on timescales that can be as short as few minutes  @xcite . in the most extreme cases ,",
    "causality constrains the size of the emission region to a fraction of the gravitational radius of the central black hole , being difficult to reconcile with the conventional model of particle acceleration at internal shocks in the jet which should act ( at least ) at dimensions of the black hole horizon  @xcite .",
    "the problem can be settled by accessing sub - minute timescales , which can be reached by very - high - energy gamma - ray telescopes with an increased detection area compared to existing instruments . with these upcoming observations , time - domain astronomy will get elevated to becoming a major contributor to our understanding of particle acceleration processes in the universe  @xcite .",
    "this is valid for the very - high - energy domain , but also for the few 100  mev domain where the end of the synchrotron spectrum of the most powerful particle accelerators can be probed .    among known particle acceleration sites ,",
    "a few are still eluding detection in gamma rays .",
    "this comprises particle acceleration in shocks generated by stellar winds interacting with the interstellar medium   and through merger and accretion shocks as well as turbulences within galaxy clusters .",
    "the identification of synchrotron radio emission from a few massive stars provides evidence that some of them are able to accelerate particles up to relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "diffuse radio synchrotron emission is also observed from several galaxy clusters indicating the presence of highly relativistic particles and large - scale magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "whether both environments are also proton accelerators , and hence potential contributors to the cosmic - ray particle population , is still an outstanding question .",
    "carinae have been interpreted as evidence for proton acceleration  @xcite , yet a convincing detection of the expected orbital modulation is still lacking  @xcite . ] as for other source classes , gamma - ray observations have the unique potential to establish these sources as proton accelerators .",
    "an evident requirement for this is a good sensitivity in the few 100  mev domain up to tev energies .",
    "angular resolution is also key , specifically for the stellar wind scenario , because potential source regions are crowded with particle accelerators ( pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae , gamma - ray binaries , supernova remnants ) .",
    "an unambiguous spatial association between a gamma - ray source and a known non - thermal radio emitting massive star is fundamental before any firm detection can be claimed .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned science challenges , there still exist _ terrae incognitae _ in the gamma - ray domain , specifically in the still poorly explored low- to medium - energy range , as well as in the ultra - high - energy range .",
    "naturally , any instrument with improved performance has the potential to uncover the unexpected , as has recently been demonstrated in the high - energy and very - high - energy domains .",
    "few have expected the ubiquity of gamma - ray emission in the universe revealed at very high energies by h.e.s.s . , magic , veritas and milagro .",
    "almost nobody has envisioned classical novae as high - energy gamma - ray sources that give a view on the dynamics of diffusive shock acceleration of protons in our galaxy , as has recently been demonstrated by fermi - lat ( yet see  @xcite ) .",
    "and the discovery of the fermi bubbles came probably as a surprise to everyone  @xcite .",
    "these are a few selected examples that illustrate how future gamma - ray instruments will push our understanding beyond the established horizons .",
    "the remainder of this paper will now show how these future gamma - ray instruments will look like .",
    "space - based gamma - ray astronomy basically covers the energy range below a few tens of gev , i.e. the low , medium- and high - energy gamma - ray domains . in the low- and medium - energy domains ,",
    "detection sensitivities are still relatively poor , yet the technologies exist to build an affordable instrument that goes well beyond the sensitivity of the integral satellite or the comptel telescope .",
    "for example , modern and space - proven highly pixelised semiconductors alike those flying currently on agile or fermi - lat  @xcite can be arranged in a compact configuration with a minimum amount of passive material ( and in particular without conversion foils ) to allow the measurement of gamma - ray photons through both compton and pair production interactions .",
    "this would lead to a system that is sensitive from the mev to the gev domain , going about more than a factor 10 beyond predecessor instruments , opening up this poorly explored energy band .",
    "in addition , such a system would be sensitive to the polarisation of incoming gamma rays , accessing a new physical dimension that provides invaluable information about the underlying emission processes and source geometries .    at higher energies , succeeding to fermi - lat",
    "will be challenging .",
    "the fermi - lat tracker has a geometric area of @xmath8  m@xmath9 , the spacecraft has a diameter of 2.5  m , a height of 2.8  m and a mass of 4.3 tons , which is a very respectable satellite .",
    "making the telescope much bigger to increase the effective detection area would soon hit the maximum capacities of existing ( and also planned ) launch vehicles .",
    "so the detection area can not be substantially expanded .",
    "significant improvement in sensitivity for pair - creation telescopes can only be achieved through a dramatic improvement in the angular resolution , especially at lower energies where the fermi - lat point spread function ( psf ) exceeds several degrees .",
    "the best ways to improve the psf are to decrease the density of the material in the tracker and to space the tracking element further apart  @xcite .",
    "this joins pretty much the needs expressed above for the low- to medium - energy domains , and both needs can be combined in a single mission providing a low - energy extension to fermi - lat .",
    "the following sections will describe some of the proposed instruments and mission concepts for the future study of the gamma - ray universe from space .",
    "table  [ tab : space ] provides a summary of the performances of the proposed instruments and mission concepts , as presented in the relevant references .",
    "the accuracy of the performance predictions varies between instruments and also depends on the maturity of the project , hence the table is only useful for order - of - magnitude comparisons .",
    "the table also indicates the context ( e.g.  `` m4 ? ''",
    "indicates a candidate mission to esa s medium - size mission call m4 ) or the lead country and quoted or plausible launch dates .",
    "performance values are given for a reference energy , which is a `` typical '' energy in the core energy range of the mission .",

    "cta ) . for wide field of view instruments ,",
    "the typical sensitivity after several years of sky survey operations are shown ( e.g.  comptel , e - astrogam , harpo , calet , dampe , herd , argo - ybl , milagro , hawc , hiscore , lhasso ) .",
    "the exception to this rule is adept for which the sensitivity for an exposure time of @xmath47 s was taken from  @xcite . in the background - dominated regime ( which essentially applies to adept ) , sensitivities scale with @xmath196 , hence for a continuous one year long observation , the sensitivity would improve by a factor of @xmath197 , making adept equivalent to harpo ( which is not surprising because both instruments are very similar ) .",
    "for the source - dominated region the sensitivity improves with @xmath198 .   for instruments in the high - energy domain , where the diffuse galactic emission is dominating the background for point source studies , sensitivities are quoted for sources at high galactic latitude ( i.e. where the background is low ) .",
    "generally , the sensitivity degradation towards the galactic plane due to diffuse emission depends on the angular resolution of the instrument . for fermi - lat , for example , the sensitivity near the galactic centre is by a factor of 10 worse than at high latitudes .",
    "owing to the better angular resolution , this penalty should be smaller for gamma-400 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sensitivities ] illustrates that a substantial improvement in sensitivity can be achieved in the medium - energy domain by a mission like e - astrogam . at mev energies",
    ", this mission would be @xmath199 times more sensitive than its predecessor comptel , and even below 1  mev , a dramatic sensitivity increase would be achieved with respect to integral / spi ( by about a factor 100 ) .",
    "e - astrogam will reach up to gev energies , with a sensitivity comparable to that of fermi - lat , and will cover the still poorly explored energy range around 100  mev where the fermi - lat sensitivity drops rapidly .",
    "this is a crucial energy range , as it features the turn - over of hadronic particle spectra , and thus is a unique carrier of distinctive information about the nature of the accelerated particles .",
    "e - astrogam would also cover the energy range that is crucial to explore the intensity and physics of the still elusive low - energy cosmic - ray component .",
    "e - astrogam furthermore covers the mev domain that is rich of gamma - ray lines which give access to nuclear cosmic - ray excitations , nucleosynthesis processes , and the positron - electron annihilation features below @xmath200  kev .",
    "the adept and harpo concepts are also promising in the medium- to high - energy domains , though both employ large volume gaseous time projection chambers that still need to demonstrate their compliance with a space environment . stratospheric balloon flights , as planned for example for the adept instrument , are here crucial to test the reliability of the instrument in a space - representative environment .",
    "another important leap in sensitivity will be achieved in the very high energy domain by cta , with a factor of @xmath201 increase with respect to current telescopes .",
    "one of the key features of cta will be the extended energy range from a few tens of gev to above 100 tev , which is nicely visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivities ] . with a few 100 hours exposure time",
    ", cta will reach milli - crab differential sensitivity , making it the most sensitive gamma - ray telescope ever .",
    "cta will reach the expected gamma - ray emission from annihilation of wimp particles with masses in the few 100 gev to few tev domain , provided that their annihilation cross section corresponds to the thermal relic density value .",
    "cta will reveal thousands of very high energy gamma - ray sources , enabling comprehensive population studies of particle accelerators in the universe .",
    "for example , cta will detect gamma - ray emission from young supernova remnants located at the opposite edge of the galaxy , accessing thus the entire galactic volume to search for the still elusive galactic pevatrons .",
    "for steady sources , cta will surpass the fermi - lat sensitivity above @xmath164  gev .",
    "for short - time phenomena , such as gamma - ray bursts or gamma - ray flares , cta will be several orders of magnitude more sensitive than fermi - lat even at lower energies , owing to its huge effective detection area of @xmath202  m@xmath9 ( compared to @xmath0  m@xmath9 for fermi - lat ) .",
    "cta will thus open a new window for time - domain astronomy , probing for example sub - minute variability in active galactic nuclei .",
    "lhasso will explore even higher energies than cta , thanks to the km2a detector that measures the muon content in atmospheric cascades .",
    "also the hiscore concept , once deployed over an area of 100 km@xmath9 , provides interesting performances in the ultra - high - energy domain . at lower energies , the wcda detector of lhasso should be more sensitive than hawc but",
    "will still be less sensitive than cta . yet",
    "the large field of view and the high duty cycle provide complementary performances to cta that are well suited for conducting sky surveys and generating transient source alerts .    to conclude , the instrumental prospects for gamma - ray astronomy are rich , and concepts for new instruments exist throughout the entire energy domain .",
    "hawc just went online , the next to come will be the cta observatory in the 2020 time frame .",
    "lhasso is also scheduled to become operative by @xmath203 .",
    "e - astrogam may be launched by 2029 , provided that it will be selected by esa as m5 mission .",
    "it is noteworthy that among all these instruments , only e - astrogam and cta will operate as open astronomical observatories , hence one may speculate that their scientific impact will be largest . in any case ,",
    "given the scientific challenges , and given the rich instrumentation that is currently planned and developed , the future of gamma - ray astronomy promises to be exciting .",
