    "the family of lanthanum - based high temperature superconductors , la214 , exhibits an anomalous drop of the transition temperature , @xmath5 , at the x = 1/8 doping level , an effect also known as the 1/8 anomaly . in ( lsco ) @xmath5 drops at x = 1/8 by about 30% with respect to the value of the unperturbed superconductor dome , @xcite whereas in the effect is much more prominent and @xmath5 reduces to almost zero.@xcite at the same doping level , an anomalously small width of the peak momentum , associated with the electronic stripe phase was measured by neutron scattering on lsco,@xcite which in addition , exhibited a commensurate ordering of the stripes with the underlying lattice.@xcite the coincidence of the two phenomena at x = 1/8 has led to the conjecture that the stripe order competes with superconductivity , and their strong interaction is responsible for this anomaly.@xcite this connection , however , has not been fully established yet , neither theoretically nor experimentally .",

    "the extracted @xmath6 exceeded the bulk @xmath5 ( @xmath74 k ) , implying that for the @xmath8 temperature range , superconductivity is confined to two - dimensional planes with negligible inter - plane coupling , a behavior which was confirmed in a recent photo - emission study of la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath2.@xcite shortly after , berg _ et al .",

    "the local density of states ( ldos ) of a phase - biased junction comprising two _ d_-wave superconductors was calculated by tanaka and kashiwaya @xcite who found that for a @xmath10 phase difference , zero - energy andreev bound states ( abss ) form at the interface .",
    "such a junction is analogous to a domain wall where the order parameter undergoes a @xmath10 phase shift ( @xmath10dw ) , described in the anti - phase ordering model put forward by berg _",

    "away from the @xmath10dw , at the center of the domain , the ldos was predicted to exhibit a suppressed peak at zero energy alongside pronounced peaks at the bulk gap edges .",
    "in contrast , for the more realistic scenario of an array of @xmath10dws with the conventional 4a@xmath12 periodicity of the stripe ordering ( where a@xmath12 is the lsco lattice constant ) , the calculated ldos exhibited a gap centered at the chemical potential instead of the zbcp .",
    "it was argued that the overlap of neighboring abss couples adjacent @xmath10dws which yields a total quenching of the zbcp .",

    "surprisingly , however , these gaps constituted less than 10% of the spectra that exhibited clear superconductor features , which were found on 30 - 40% of the sample surface .",

    "however , no clear correlation was found between the zbcp and glf for the intermediate amplitudes , possibly due to the inhomogeneity of the superconductor - gap , regularly found in the tunneling spectra of cuprates.@xcite one should recall that the ldos of a _ d_-wave superconductor should feature a similar zbcp with glfs when tunneling into the _ ab_-plane ( excluding the anti - nodal direction ) . in such setups ,",
    "the glf to zbcp magnitude ratio is indicative of the in - plane tunneling angle with respect to the nodal direction . obviously , this is not the case in our present _ c_-axis films .        due to the absence of a clear correlation between the mid - gap and gap - edge states we focus on the spatial evolution of the low energy states , namely the evolution of the zbcp . in figs . 2 and 3 we plot the di / dv vs v tunneling spectra as a function of position of their acquisition",
    "the detailed spatial evolution of the ldos exhibited two distinct types of spatial dependencies .",
    "the first type consisted of a modulated zbcp amplitude with a modulation length ranging from a few nm to tens of nm .",

    "about 9 nm part the two most pronounced zbcps , and @xmath1818 nm separate the next pronounced peak ( of reduced height ) . in between , and just midway the latter two peaks , one can see the effect of the surface disorder mentioned above , smearing the zbcps on a short length scale .",
    "the longest modulation scale we found was close to 60 nm and is presented in fig .",
    "2(b ) , in which a single wide maximum of the zbcp amplitude was recorded along the line .",
    "the slow variation of the zbcp magnitude within the segment around the maximal height ( marked by a white double - headed arrow in the base of the figure ) is demonstrated in the inset . towards the edges of this line scan ,",
    "a continuous reduction of the zero energy spectral weight is noticeable over a length scale of 10 - 20 nm , an order of magnitude larger than the decay length shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) .    the second type of spatial dependence consisted of a constant zbcp amplitude .",
    "two typical examples are presented in fig . 3 , and evidently , these curves show a minuscule variation of the ldos along the line .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) where all the di / dv curves collapse onto a single curve when all the spectra obtained along the entire line are plotted .",
    "typically , the dos in such cases was robustly fixed for the entire spectrum we examined , and not only at low energies on which the spectra in fig .",
    "3(a ) focus .",
    "3(b ) demonstrates the robustness of the ldos for tunneling spectra taken along a 30 nm long line , on a different sample .",
    "it is important to note that the lines in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) were measured sequentially at perpendicular and intersecting trajectories .",
    "dw is represented by the dashed line .",
    "b ) a constant zbcp is expected for tunneling spectral lines in parallel to the dw like the one connecting points c and d in ( a ) .",
    "c ) a modulation of the zbcp amplitude should occur for any line with @xmath19 0 . in the case of the line connecting the points a and b ,",
    "a double peak structure will emerge since it crosses two @xmath10dws.,width=307 ]    the parallels of these results with the framework of the aforementioned isolated @xmath10dw scenario,@xcite are compelling . in the limit of decoupled @xmath10dws ,",
    "the ldos were predicted to consist of a zbcp featuring a spatially dependent amplitude determined by the distance from the dw .",
    "consequently , lines parallel to a @xmath10dw should exhibit a constant zbcp amplitude while any trajectory intersecting a dw at an angle @xmath20 , will result in a modulated zbcp amplitude with an @xmath20-dependent modulation length , corresponding to the effective distance from the dw .",
    "multiple decoupled @xmath10dws may induce multiple maxima in the zbcp magnitude along a line crossing them with spacing that depends on the inter-@xmath10dw distance and @xmath20 .",
    "the sketch in fig .",
    "4(a ) illustrates two different types of lines within the anti - phase ordered plane along which tunneling spectra can be acquired , one running parallel to the @xmath10dws and one crossing them .",
    "the spatial evolution of the ldos in figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) are segments taken from the line scans presented in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) , respectively .",
    "both lines comply well with the two different expected behaviors corresponding to the lines sketched in 4(a ) .",
    "the line connecting a and b in fig .",
    "4(a ) crosses two @xmath10dws ( dashed lines ) , hence , a double - peak structure emerges in the corresponding spectra acquired along such a line , as shown in fig .",
    "in contrast , the parallel line connecting c and d should produce a constant zbcp line , as shown in fig .",
    "note that at a right angle ( @xmath21 ) , the distance between the most pronounced zbcps ( inter - maxima distance ) will be minimal and equal to the local spacing between adjacent @xmath10dws .",
    "following the above considerations , we attribute our results to a state of decoupled @xmath10dws by assigning an appropriate angle , @xmath20 , to each line of spectra presented in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "obviously , @xmath20=0 for the lines exhibiting a constant zbcp in fig .",
    "3 . a small angle will precipitate the slow variation in the ldos portrayed in fig .",
    "2(b ) , since the effective distance from the dw varies slowly along the line . in contrast , the rapid modulation of the ldos in fig .",
    "2(a ) will occur at large angles .",
    "the fact that the the spectra presented in fig .",
    "2(a ) were measured along a line intersecting at a right angle the line at which the spectra presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) were acquired , indicates that for fig .",
    "2(a ) @xmath22/2 , which implies that the observed 9 nm inter - maxima interval corresponds to the local distance between the neighboring @xmath10dws .",
    "such distances are consistent with the assumed negligible @xmath10dw coupling , since they are almost twice the spatial width of the abs , which is of the order of @xmath23 ( @xmath18 5 nm in the case of lsco ) .",
    "we also note that the modulation scale is larger than the spacing between charge stripes ( @xmath18 1.5 nm ) , an issue that is discussed further below .",

    "b ) di / dv vs. v curves exhibiting split zbcps and a pronounced centered ( un - split ) zbcp taken at the indicated positions in ( a).,width=288 ]    a subtle feature of the modulated zbcp , appearing only occasionally in the spectra lines , was an asymmetric splitting with a varying degree of imbalance between the negative and positive peak heights .",
    "the imbalance ranged from a small difference in peak heights to a state where one of the peaks was completely suppressed .",
    "the transition from a nearly fully suppressed positive peak , to a nearly fully suppressed negative peak , through a centered ( un - split ) zbcp , could take place even within a distance of a few nm , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "5(a ) and highlighted by the three spectra presented in fig . 5(b ) .",
    "interestingly , the imbalance of the peaks in fig .",
    "5(a ) meandered continuously between the points indicated by the arrows labelled 1 and 3 , and in between ( at point 2 ) , where a pronounced un - split zbcp was observed , the low energy spectral weight reached a maxima as clearly depicted in fig .",
    "also note that di / dv vs. v curves featuring a split zbcp [ i.e. the spectra in the region enclosed by arrows 1 and 3 in fig .",
    "5(a ) ] exhibited a relatively high spectral weight at low energies compared to the curves at the bottom and top ends of the line , where a suppressed un - split zbcp was found .",
    "a markedly different spatial evolution of a split zbcp was apparent along the line depicted in fig .",
    "6(a ) . here",
    ", a periodic modulation was measured with a period of @xmath184 nm . unlike the line in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the imbalance did not cross the zero energy . instead , the negative peak was consistently higher than the positive peak throughout the entire line , as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , in which a selection of di / dv vs v curves from fig .",
    "6(a ) are plotted .    according to the decoupled @xmath10dw scenario @xcite ( as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , in the case of a moderate pairing strength , an imbalanced split of the zbcp is expected to occur at the vicinity of the dw . at sufficiently long distances from the dw",
    "the splitting disappears and a suppressed zbcp is predicted to be found , as in the case of the weak pairing limit , as indeed shown in fig .",
    "consequently , the spatially modulated split zbcps presented in figs . 5 and 6 , can be understood within the framework of the decoupled @xmath10dw scenario assuming a locally moderate pairing strength ( as opposed to the data presented in figs . 2 and 3 , where the data complies with a relatively weak pairing strength ) .",
    "we note that lines of spectra showing either split or un - split zbcps were found on the same sample , suggesting ( according to ref . )",
    "that the local pairing amplitude in our samples is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "this is a reasonable conjecture in view of the superconducting - gap inhomogeneities reported in the cuprates @xcite which have been considered to reflect an inhomogeneity of the local pairing strength .",
    "typically , the inversion of the split peak imbalance should take place at the @xmath10dw owing to the sign change of the order parameter .",
    "this implies that a @xmath10dw resides between points 1 and 3 in fig .",
    "the suppressed un - split zbcp measured at the bottom and top ends of fig .",
    "5(a ) further corroborates this conjecture , since according to the isolated @xmath10dw scenario , the splitting occurs only in the vicinity of the dw where , in parallel , the low - energy spectral weight is maximal .",
    "dw has been crossed .",
    "all curves are vertically shifted for clarity.,width=288 ]    we now turn to discuss the spectra - line presented in fig . 6 that exhibits a periodic modulation of the negative - bias peak height of the split zbcp , with a period length of @xmath18 4 nm , close to @xmath23 .",
    "such a short period seems to contradict the isolated @xmath10dw scenario since at these distances the inevitable overlap of the neighboring abss is predicted to quench the zbcp.@xcite however , the fact that the negative peak was consistently higher than the positive peak indicates that a @xmath10dw was not crossed and the line in fig .",
    "6(a ) is in fact parallel to a @xmath10dw . in this case",
    "it is possible that the observed modulation is an outcome of the conjectured @xcite one - dimensional band formed along the @xmath10dw in which the wavefunction of a charge carrier should oscillate with a period corresponding to the spatial width of an abs , namely @xmath24 .",
    "we have also measured the tunneling spectra of a ( 110)la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 reference film where zbcp manifesting the nodal abss are the common spectral feature . in this sample",
    "only weak spurious variations of the zbcp and gap - like features amplitude were found , in contrast to the well defined spatial modulations seen on the ( 001)la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 film , presented in fig .",
    "2 . moreover , no split zbcps were detected , thus ruling out the possibility of spontaneous splitting due to a subdominant order parameter as has been reported to occur in overdoped ( 110)@xcite .",
    "a question that remains is whether the dws are truly decoupled .",
    "theoretical studies of the anti - phase order predicted that @xmath10-phase ( and consequently @xmath10dw ) ordering could be unstable since the introduction of additional mid - gap states increases the energy of the system.@xcite however , yang _",
    "et al . _ @xcite find that the energy cost decreases as the domain size increases from the stripe periodicity of 4 unit cells , to 8 and 10 unit cells , although it remained positive for all studied values .",
    "thus according to ref .",
    "it is more likely that an order of decoupled anti - phase dws ( due to the large domain size ) will form rather than a system of overlapping @xmath10dws once an anti - phase ordering sets in .",
    "we wish to emphasize however , that the @xmath18 9 nm spacing ( corresponding to 6 stripe unit cells , 24a@xmath12 , in lsco ) between zbcp maxima observed for a line taken perpendicular to the @xmath10dw does not imply that this indeed is the generic spacing between @xmath10dws .",
    "it may well be that , due to surface disorder , some @xmath10dws are quenched , yielding spatial variations in the apparent @xmath10dw spacing .",
    "finally , we note that the theoretical works that analyzed arrays of coupled @xmath10dws predicted that a gap will open at the chemical potential rather than a zbcp . in our previous report",
    "@xcite we have already disclosed that @xmath18 10% of the superconductor related data comprised a v - shaped gap .",
    "a gap of @xmath18 10 mev was extracted by fitting to the theory of tunneling into a _ d_-wave superconductor.@xcite it is possible that this gap is truly the _",
    "c_-axis pairing gap found at large enough distances from a @xmath10dw so that its effect is negligible . on the other hand , it may well be that the gap is not directly related to the superconducting order parameter and rather originates from the local overlap of a neighboring @xmath10dws .",
    "this notion gains support in light of the relatively large variations in the gap features ( e.g. width and zero - bias conductance ) shown in fig .",
    "our scanning tunneling spectroscopy data measured on _",
    "c_-axis la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 films exhibit various features that are in accord with the predicted ldos of the anti - phase ordering , in the limit of decoupled domain walls .",
    "the abundance of the zbcps found on our _ c_-axis films is attributed to the formation of abss at the @xmath10dw and their spatial evolution is a consequence of the distance of the location of measurement from the nearby @xmath10dw . the spatial evolution of the imbalanced split zbcps , which is another trademark of the @xmath10dw model , points to an inhomogeneity of the pairing strength within the sample surface .",
    "we conclude that our results are indicative of a decoupled @xmath10dws state that provides possible evidence for the predicted anti - phase ordering of the superconductor order parameter at x = 1/8 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first experimental indication for an anisotropic ordering of the _ d_-wave order parameter .",
