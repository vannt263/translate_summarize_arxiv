    "yang - mills theory , of self - interacting gluons , is not a full description of the strong interaction occurring in nature , but even on its own it is remarkably rich . at low temperatures ,",
    "it is a confining theory , describing a world of color - neutral particles . at high temperatures ,",
    "yang - mills theory describes weakly - interacting color - charged deconfined particles in a plasma .",
    "this exactly mimics the behavior of qcd .",
    "however , unlike qcd , pure gauge theory has an exact global symmetry associated with the change from a confining to a deconfining theory , giving a strict finite - temperature phase transition . for a more general gauge theory where",
    "the number of gluons is increased e.g.  @xmath2 , there are hints of a simpler description in terms of string dynamics in the limit @xmath3 @xcite , a limit which appears surprisingly close to the real world with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there is evidence of an effective string theory which describes the excitations of the color flux tube , the qcd string , in the confined phase of the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "yang - mills theory is also a testing ground for ideas about what are the relevant degrees of freedom that lead to confinement , possible candidates being center vortices , monopoles , instantons or other topological features @xcite . from a practical viewpoint , lattice simulations of pure gauge theory",
    "are much less computationally intensive than those of full qcd , allowing some questions to be answered in greater detail .",
    "the global symmetry relevant for the deconfinement transition in pure gauge theory is the center symmetry @xcite .",
    "finite - temperature @xmath5 in the gauge theory means the euclidean time direction is of finite extent @xmath6 and physical quantities are periodic in this direction . for gauge group @xmath7 ,",
    "the gauge fields themselves are only periodic in the time direction up to a gauge transformation .",
    "the gauge transformations can be twisted globally by @xmath8 , the center of the group @xmath7 .",
    "the center is the largest subgroup whose elements commute with all elements of the full group .",
    "this is an exact global symmetry of yang - mills theory at finite temperature . at low temperatures ,",
    "the theory is confining and the center symmetry is intact . at the critical temperature @xmath9 where the theory becomes deconfining , the center symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "hence deconfinement in pure gauge theory is a strict phase transition .",
    "quarks break the center symmetry explicitly , so the switch from confinement to deconfinement in qcd is a crossover .    over the years",
    ", the finite - temperature deconfinement phase transition in yang - mills theory has been studied in great detail and non - perturbative lattice simulations have played a decisive role .",
    "one can test ideas about the deconfinement transition by varying the gauge group and the space - time dimensionality .",
    "let us summarize what is currently known .",
    "if the deconfinement transition is of second order , with a diverging correlation length @xmath10 , svetitsky and yaffe conjectured that the universal properties of the transition are identical to those of the ordering transition of a spin model in one lower dimension .",
    "in particular , the symmetry of the spin system is the center of the gauge group @xcite . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the center is @xmath11 , the complex @xmath12-th roots of 1 . in @xmath13 dimensions ,",
    "@xmath14 gauge theory does have a second order deconfinement transition @xcite and its universal properties , e.g.  how the correlation length diverges near the critical temperature , @xmath15 are identical to those of the 3-dimensional @xmath16-symmetric spin system i.e.  the ising model @xcite .",
    "most relevant to nature , @xmath13-dimensional @xmath17 gauge theory has a weak first order deconfinement transition with a large but finite correlation length @xcite , and the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture does not apply . continuing this sequence in @xmath13 dimensions ,",
    "@xmath2 gauge theories continue to have first order deconfinement transitions for @xmath18 , with the transition becoming stronger as @xmath12 increases @xcite . in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "the story is somewhat different , with @xmath14 and @xmath17 gauge theories both having second order transitions , belonging to the universality classes of the 2-dimensional @xmath16- and @xmath19-symmetric spin models respectively @xcite .",
    "for @xmath20 the transition appears very weak but it is not possible to rule out that it is first order , especially as the @xmath21 universality class has a set of continuously varying critical exponents @xcite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13-dimensional @xmath2 gauge theory has a deconfinement transition that switches from second to first order as @xmath12 increases .",
    "however , as the center @xmath11 also varies , it s not possible to separate the size of the group from the change in the center symmetry .",
    "an alternate sequence one can consider is that of the symplectic groups @xmath22 , whose center is @xmath16 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the group @xmath22 has @xmath23 generators and there is a common member @xmath24 .",
    "hence one can study the effect of the size of the group on the deconfinement transition without changing the symmetry class .",
    "what was found is somewhat surprising @xcite . in @xmath13 dimensions ,",
    "the @xmath22 deconfinement transition changes from second to first order going from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "@xmath22 gauge theory has second order deconfinement transitions for @xmath25 and 2 , but it becomes first order for @xmath4 .",
    "all second order transitions belong to the expected @xmath16 universality class .",
    "this is the same qualitative behavior as for @xmath2 , but in this case the center symmetry is unchanged and one might _ a priori _ expect the nature of the deconfinement transition to be the same for all gauge groups .    a crude argument one can make in favor of first order deconfinement transitions for large groups is the mismatch of degrees of freedom at the critical temperature . as the size of the group increases , so does the number of deconfined gluons in the plasma phase , while the number of color - neutral states in the confined phase is unchanged .",
    "the results for @xmath22 indicate that the size of the group seems to dictate the order of the transition , as the @xmath16 universality class is available for all @xmath12 , but the gauge theory chooses not to avail of it as @xmath12 increases .",
    "the situation is actually similar for @xmath2 in @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "it turns out that the ordering transitions of 3-dimensional @xmath11-symmetric spin models for @xmath27 all belong to the universality class of the 3-dimensional @xmath28-symmetric @xmath29 model : the @xmath11 symmetry is enhanced to @xmath28 at the critical point @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath2 gauge theories have first order deconfinement transitions for @xmath30 and choose not to utilise the available universality class .",
    "a further surprise is given by the exceptional group @xmath31 , which has 14 generators and whose center is trivially 1 . with a trivial center",
    ", there is no distinction between the confined and deconfined phases and one would expect the deconfinement transition to be a crossover without any singularity @xcite .",
    "in fact , it appears that @xmath13-dimensional @xmath31 gauge theory actually has an unexpected first order finite - temperature deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "again , the size of the group , measured for example by the number of generators , seems to drive the transition first order , independent of the symmetry associated with the transition .    the purpose of this paper is to add one more datum to this collection of results .",
    "we examine @xmath1 gauge theory in @xmath0 dimensions , the smallest group which has not yet been studied in this space - time . comparing to the known results for @xmath2 and @xmath22 gauge theory",
    ", one would expect the @xmath1 deconfinement transition to be of first order .",
    "the @xmath20 transition is very weak and possibly belongs to the @xmath21 universality class , but could also be first order .",
    "the @xmath32 deconfinement transition is weak but clearly of first order .",
    "a first order transition for @xmath1 would be consistent with the general notion that the size of the group dictates the order of the transition , and we test the idea with this study .",
    "there are additional reasons to expect a first order deconfinement transition for this theory .",
    "the relevant spin model for @xmath1 is the 2-dimensional @xmath33-symmetric spin model , for which no universality class is known .",
    "in fact , the ordering transition of the @xmath11 potts model in 2 dimensions is of first order for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the correlation length of the potts model at the critical point behaves as @xcite @xmath34 which diverges as @xmath35 and is already on the order of a few thousand lattice spacings for @xmath36 , indicating a very weak first order transition .",
    "this might be an indication that the deconfinement transition of the gauge theory is first order but weak . in any event",
    ", we wish to rule out any surprises by establishing the nature of the gauge theory transition using lattice simulations .    in the course of writing this paper , we learnt of related work by liddle and teper investigating the deconfinement transition of @xmath2 gauge theories in @xmath0 dimensions for @xmath37 and 6 @xcite .",
    "we believe they come to the same conclusion that @xmath1 gauge theory has a first order transition .",
    "we perform standard lattice simulations of @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "we use a finite periodic lattice volume of size @xmath38 and lattice spacing @xmath39 .",
    "the fundamental variables are gauge links @xmath40 which are elements of the group @xmath1 .",
    "we use the standard wilson plaquette gauge action @xmath41 = \\frac{10}{g^2 } \\sum_\\box ( 1 - \\frac{1}{5}{\\rm re tr } u_\\box ) = \\frac{10}{g^2 } \\sum_{x,\\mu < \\nu } ( 1 - \\frac{1}{5}{\\rm re tr } ( u_{x,\\mu } u_{x+\\hat{\\mu},\\nu } u^{\\dagger}_{x+\\hat{\\nu},\\mu } u^{\\dagger}_{x,\\nu } ) ) , \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the bare gauge coupling .",

    "the relevant observable to examine the finite - temperature deconfinement transition is the complex - valued polyakov loop @xcite , @xmath45 given by a path - ordered product of the time - like gauge links .",
    "the gauge links in the time direction are periodic up to a gauge transformation .",
    "the gauge transformation itself need not be periodic but can be twisted by @xmath46 .",
    "this center rotation leaves the action @xmath47 unchanged , hence this is an exact symmetry of the theory .",
    "however the polyakov loop picks up the twist @xmath48 because it wraps completely around the finite time direction , so it is sensitive to the center .",
    "the polyakov loop expectation value , @xmath49 ) , \\label{eq : vev}\\ ] ] measures the free energy @xmath50 at finite temperature @xmath5 of a static test quark sitting in the box , @xmath51 . in the confined phase without isolated color - charged particles , the quark free energy diverges , @xmath52 and the center symmetry is intact , since @xmath53 . above the critical temperature @xmath9 where the theory becomes deconfining , color - charged particles in the plasma have a finite free energy , @xmath54 and the center symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "hence the deconfinement transition can be identified via the behavior of the polyakov loop .",
    "we use standard methods in our lattice simulations . with the wilson gauge action , we generate ensembles of gauge configurations using heat - bath @xcite and over - relaxation @xcite algorithms to update the various @xmath14 subgroups of the @xmath1 gauge links @xcite .",
    "one can update all possible @xmath14 subgroups , but this is likely to be an overkill and in practice we update five randomly chosen subgroups .",
    "one sweep of the lattice volume corresponds to one heat - bath and four over - relaxation updates of every gauge link .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath39 is implicitly determined by the bare gauge coupling @xmath55 and the continuum limit is approached by taking @xmath56 . in practice one simulates at a number of @xmath57 values and tries to extrapolate results to the continuum .",
    "one has to beware of any possible unphysical transitions in the theory at finite @xmath57 .",
    "if such a bulk transition exists , this sets a lower limit on @xmath57 i.e.  an upper limit on the coarsest lattice spacing one can use and still make a connection to continuum physics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaquette ] we plot the expectation value of the plaquette as a function of the bare gauge coupling on @xmath58 volumes .",

    "the fact that the transition appears to be weak , as measured by the latent heat , might even have been suggested by the very large correlation length @xmath10 in the 2-dimensional @xmath33 potts model at the critical point .",
    "however , the effective action for the polyakov loop has a complicated non - local form . that it shares the dimensionality and global symmetry of the potts model does not dictate its functional form and ultimately the behavior of the deconfinement transition .",
    "it was very unlikely to discover a new universality class for the phase transition of the gauge theory , but since lattice simulations can give a definitive answer , we believe we have ruled out this possibility .",
    "although is seems clear that the first order transition of @xmath2 gauge theory increases in strength with @xmath12 , it has been suggested that the @xmath3 transition might be of second order @xcite .",

    ". this might be an attractive scenario , but it is completely opposed by all the evidence .",
    "the general picture appears consistent : where universality classes are available for `` small '' gauge groups , the deconfinement transition is of second order and has the universal properties of the ordering transition of the respective spin model .",
    "however the transition switches to being first order as the gauge group increases in size , both in @xmath0 and @xmath13 dimensions , even though there are available universality classes .",
    "it is even more surprising that @xmath13-dimensional @xmath31 gauge theory has a first order transition , given that the center is trivial .",
    "it is easy to correlate this general behavior with the size of the gauge groups and speculate that the large number of degrees of freedom is the driving force .",
    "one hopes that this collection of information can give some insight into the full behavior of the polyakov loop effective action or other properties of the gauge theory .",
