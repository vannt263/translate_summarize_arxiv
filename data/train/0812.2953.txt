    "@xmath109 is the length of cantilever , and , for the simple cantilever geometry considered here , the displacement vector is only a function of position along the axis of the cantilevers ( @xmath110 ) . with this definition of amplitude ,",
    "the effective motional mass is simply the total mass of the two cantilevers ( @xmath111 picograms ) and the effective spring constant is defined by the usual relation @xmath112 , with @xmath83 the mechanical eigenmode frequency .",
    "the amplitude associated with zero - point motion and used in the equipartition theorem to determine the thermal excitation of the mechanical mode is then @xmath113 . in the case of the fundamental differential mechanical mode of motion for the two cantilevers of the zipper cavity , this normalization prescription yields @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are in - plane unit vectors associated with the two nanobeams of the zipper cavity and pointing in opposite directions away from the center of the gap between the nanobeams .",
    "thus , to be consistent , @xmath10 for the @xmath59 mode must be defined approximately as the rate of change of cavity frequency with respect to _ half _ the change in slot gap ( @xmath117 ) , as the amplitude @xmath118 corresponds to a change in slot gap of @xmath119 near the center of the cavity .",

    "optical force noise contribution to the motional sensitivity is negligible .",
    "a fiber - taper optical coupling technique was used to in - couple and out - couple light from the zipper cavity .",
    "the fiber taper , although extremely low - loss on its own ( @xmath134 transmission efficiency in this work ) , was put in contact with the substrate near the zipper cavity in order to mechanically anchor it during all measurements ( thus avoiding power - dependent movement of the taper due to thermal and/or optical forces ) .",
    "the total fiber taper transmission after mechanical anchoring of the taper to the substrate is @xmath135 . in order to accurately determine the optical power reaching the cavity ( determined by the optical loss in the taper section before the cavity ) we measure the cavity response at high optical power ( resulting in thermo - optic tuning of the cavity and optical bistability in the transmission response ) with the input sent in one direction and then in the other of the taper . from the asymmetry in the thermo - optic tuning in the cavity for",
    "both directions one can determine the asymmetry in the optical loss , and thus determine the optical loss before and after the zipper cavity .",
    "finally , this method along with calibrated measurements of the optical power at the input and output of the taper , can determine accurately the optical power reaching the zipper cavity ( the _ input _ power ) and dropped by the cavity . from calibration of the wavelength sweep using the fiber mach - zender interferometer",
    "one can also accurately measure the cavity linewidth and the corresponding loaded cavity @xmath45 .",
    "the average stored photon number can then be determined from the dropped power and the loaded cavity @xmath45 .",
    "the te@xmath56 mode is chosen to study in detail , instead of the te@xmath136 fundamental mode , due to its spectral alignment with the edfa gain bandwidth , allowing for the higher power measurements presented in fig .",

    "the transduction from mechanical motion to modulated intra - cavity power , and consequently measured rf photodector spectrum , depends sensitively on the detuning point of the laser from the cavity resonance .",
    "accurate measurement of the laser - cavity detuning , even for large detunings ( @xmath137 half - cavity - linewidths ) , is required to compare the theoretical model with measured data for the optical spring and damping shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spring_damping ] . several methods exist to determine the laser - cavity detuning , including calibration of the transduced modulated photodector signal for a known mechanical or optical modulation , or simple inversion of the normalized optical transmission signal using the measured lorentzian response of the cavity . for",
    "the swept measurements presented in this work , we have opted to calibrate accurately the laser wavelength versus sweep time using a fiber - based mach - zender interferometer ( fsr@xmath138 pm at @xmath139 nm ) , and to use this to fit and convert sweep time to laser - cavity detuning by comparing with a nonlinear model of the cavity system that incorporates thermo - optic and gradient - force tuning .",
    "the thermo - optic cavity tuning versus temperature was measured to be @xmath140 pm / k by direct measurement of the resonance wavelength shift over a @xmath141 k temperature range .",
    "the optomechanical coupling constant @xmath10 was estimated from both simulation , based upon an fem model of scanning - electron - microscope ( sem ) images taken of the cavity geometry , and a fit to the peak measured mechanical frequency shift .",
    "the nonlinear cavity model , incorporating the measured thermo - optic effect and the fit @xmath10 , then provides an accurate conversion between wavelength and detuning from the cavity .",
    "the above method for calibrating laser - cavity detuning is simple to employ with the swept wavelength method used in this work , and found to be much more accurate than relying on the low - pass - filtered optical transmission contrast to infer detuning ( especially for large detunings where the transmission contrast is below the percent level ) .      as mentioned above ,",
    "although the optical force dominates the cavity tuning at mhz frequencies , the static tuning of the cavity is still largely ( @xmath142 ) provided by the thermo - optic effect through optical absorption and subsequent heat generation within the zipper cavity .",
    "calculation of the thermal resistance of the silicon nitride zipper cavity indicates that optical absorption accounts for approximately @xmath143 of the total optical cavity loss for the device in fig .",
    "[ fig : spring_damping](a ) ( an absorption - limited @xmath144 ) .",
    "we attribute the optical absorption loss in the zipper cavity to surface - states@xcite of the `` holey '' silicon nitride beams , rather than absorption in the bulk of the silicon nitride film , due to the much larger @xmath45 values we have measured in less surface - sensitive microdisks formed from the same silicon nitride material .",
    "properly chosen chemical surface treatments should enable @xmath45-factors approaching the bulk - absorption - limited value of @xmath145 at @xmath146 @xmath30 m , and perhaps even higher at shorter wavelengths where optical absorption from overtones of the vibrational modes of the n - h bond is reduced .",
