    "the process @xmath1 is already one of the key processes at lep2 , and will be of similar importance at future linear @xmath4 colliders . hence it is not surprising that considerable theoretical effort has gone into the precise prediction of the cross - section in the standard model ( sm ) , both for on- and off - shell w bosons ( @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) .    for a process well accessible both experimentally and theoretically in the sm ,",
    "one of the obvious questions to ask is whether it can tell us anything about physics beyond the sm .",
    "supersymmetric extensions play a special role because they , like the sm , allow to make precise predictions in terms of a set of input parameters .",
    "previous calculations in supersymmetric theories include the complete one - loop corrections in spontaneously broken supersymmetry @xcite , sfermion - loop effects in the mssm @xcite , and also the complete mssm corrections to the closely related triple - gauge - boson vertex @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the complete one - loop corrections for @xmath1 in the mssm including real bremsstrahlung in the soft - photon approximation are presented .",
    "the results are rather small : the maximum deviation from the standard model within the scanned region of parameter space is @xmath5 for unpolarized and transversally polarized w bosons , and @xmath6 for longitudinal w bosons .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : kin&not ] the kinematics and notation are fixed .",
    "[ sect:1loop ] describes the details of the one - loop calculation .",
    "the results of the calculation and the scan over the mssm parameter space are presented in sect.[sect : results ] .",
    "[ sect : conclus ] finally gives the conclusions .",
    "the reaction studied here is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the momenta and helicities of the external particles , respectively .",
    "the incoming particles travel along the @xmath10 axis and are scattered into the @xmath11@xmath10 plane . neglecting the electron mass , the explicit representations of the momenta and the polarization vectors in the centre - of - mass system are @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity of the electrons , @xmath14 is the momentum of the w bosons , @xmath15 is the beam energy , and @xmath16 is the scattering angle .    the polarized differential cross - section is obtained from the helicity amplitudes @xmath17 as @xmath18 in the following , only unpolarized electrons are considered , since that is the situation at lep2 . in this case",
    "the cross - section has to be averaged over the initial helicities according to @xmath19 polarization combinations are given by a sequence of four letters , uult , where l , t , and u denote longitudinal ( @xmath20 ) , transverse ( @xmath21 ) , and unpolarized particles .",
    "since the coupling of the electron to any of the higgs particles in the sm or the mssm is suppressed by a factor @xmath22 , the higgs - exchange diagrams can safely be neglected .",
    "the tree - level diagrams are then the same for the sm and the mssm , @xmath23 and @xmath24 exchange in the @xmath25-channel and neutrino exchange in the @xmath26-channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : born ] ) .",
    "the tree - level results shall not be discussed here as this has been done in detail elsewhere ( explicit formulas can be found in @xcite ) .    the tree - level diagrams . ]",
    "the calculation of the @xmath0 radiative corrections has been performed in t  hooft  feynman gauge .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences were treated within dimensional regularization . for the renormalization",
    "the on - shell scheme @xcite was used , following the formulation worked out in @xcite . in the absence of susy particles at tree level ,",
    "only those counter - terms appear that are already present in the sm .",
    "the only change is that now the self - energies from which the renormalization constants are derived have to be calculated in the mssm .    to @xmath0 ,",
    "the squared matrix element is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the sum of the contributing tree - level and one - loop feynman diagrams , respectively , and @xmath30 is the qed correction factor from real bremsstrahlung in the soft - photon approximation .",
    "the feynman diagrams were generated with  @xcite which in its current version uses algorithms that can deal with supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "the resulting amplitudes were algebraically simplified using  @xcite and then converted to a fortran program .",
    "the package @xcite was used to evaluate the one - loop scalar and tensor integrals . for a single point in phase and parameter space",
    "the fortran program runs about 3.6 ms in the sm and 102 ms in the mssm .",
    "scans over parameter space in the mssm typically take several hours .    apart from obvious checks such as uv- and ir - finiteness ,",
    "the sm results of @xcite were fully confirmed and the effects of sfermion - loops in @xcite could be reproduced for various scenarios of sfermion masses to within a very small constant shift ( @xmath31 ) which is an effect of the different renormalization schemes used and hence of higher order .    with the presence of external gauge bosons",
    "one might expect sizable gauge cancellations and hence instabilities in the numerical code .",
    "to safeguard against such problems , the sm values were computed once in the conventional way and once in the background - field method @xcite , where gauge cancellations should be greatly reduced , and an agreement to 9 digits was found . even though the same comparison can not easily be done for the mssm",
    "( a corresponding model file is currently not available ) , a similar stability is expected since the gauge structure of the mssm is essentially the same as in the sm . as an alternative measure of stability , one can compare the individual contributions from self - energies , vertices , and boxes with their sum . to show that the cancellations are harmless numerically , the following table lists the individual contributions ( each of them renormalized ) that make up the amplitude at a particular point in parameter space for longitudinal w bosons , for which the largest cancellations can be expected .",
    "@xmath32      in addition to the virtual diagrams , real photon emission from the external legs has to be taken into account to cancel the infrared ( ir ) divergences which arise from the exchange of massless photons .",
    "the ir divergences are regularized by an infinitesimal photon mass @xmath33 . in the soft - photon limit",
    "the cross - section for real photon emission is proportional to the born cross - section , @xmath34 with the soft - photon factor @xmath30 given by @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the maximum energy of the emitted photons , @xmath37 is the charge of the @xmath38th external particle , and the sign in front of the product @xmath39 is @xmath40 if particles @xmath38 and @xmath41 are both either incoming or outgoing , and @xmath42 otherwise .",
    "the basic integrals needed for the evaluation of have been worked out in @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the @xmath0 corrections is largely determined by the qed contributions and depends strongly on the photon - energy cutoff @xmath36 through logarithms of the form @xmath43 . without an experimentally motivated choice of @xmath44 , the overall size of the one - loop corrections can be shifted more or less at will using different values of @xmath36 . since the intention here is only to show the differences between the sm and the mssm calculations , the concrete value of @xmath36 is rather unimportant . in this calculation",
    "a soft - photon cutoff energy of @xmath45 has been used as in @xcite .",
    "the cancellation of the ir divergences has been checked numerically by varying the photon - mass @xmath33 on which the result must not depend .",
    "a variation of @xmath33 from 1 to @xmath46 gev leaves the first 10 digits of the cross - section invariant .    while soft - photon radiation is sufficient to cancel ir divergences , it is an approximation , valid only if @xmath36 is small compared to all relevant energy scales .",
    "if this is not the case , hard - photon radiation must be taken into account , too .",
    "however , the hard - photon corrections at @xmath0 are exactly the same as in the sm , therefore they have been omitted in the present calculation .",
    "this section lists the contributing one - loop diagrams .",
    "the diagrams can be separated into self - energy contributions , vertex corrections , and box corrections .",
    "note that diagrams which are already present in the sm are omitted in the figures .",
    "the self - energy contributions fall into two categories , corrections to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 propagator in the @xmath25-channel , and corrections to the @xmath47 propagator in the @xmath26-channel .",

    "while the largest corrections ( @xmath79 at 1 tev ) are seen for purely longitudinal w bosons , one has to keep in mind that the cross - section for longitudinally polarized w bosons is much smaller than for the transverse polarizations . in the transverse polarizations and in the unpolarized case",
