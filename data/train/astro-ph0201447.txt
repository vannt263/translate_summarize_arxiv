    "it is generally agreed that the broad absorption line ( bal ) systems seen in the spectra of many quasars are intrinsic to the quasar , arising from high velocity outflow of gas directly from the accretion disk region @xcite .",
    "narrow absorption lines in quasar spectra , however , arise from a variety of sources .",
    "narrow absorption lines with small velocities relative to the quasar emission redshift could be caused by galaxies along the line of sight , clouds in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy , or even smaller scale gas flows within a few parsecs of the black hole .",
    "on the other hand , most of the narrow absorption systems that have large velocities with respect to the emission redshift of the quasar are thought to be intervening @xcite ; however , there is increasing evidence that even some fraction of these may be intrinsic . in many bal quasars ,",
    "the absorption troughs have considerable structure , suggesting a connection to narrow absorption line systems .",
    "we discuss the spectrum of a newly discovered quasar , first j074711.2 + 273904 ( hereafter first  0747 + 2739 ) , with an overdensity of absorbers in its spectrum .",
    "it may be an example of an object whose bal component has been caught in a transitional state that could be related to orientation , time , or density .",
    "first  0747 + 2739 was discovered in the early stages of an ongoing project to search for extremely red quasars @xcite .",
    "candidates are found by matching point sources from the the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) with first radio sources , and then further matching to an optical catalog such as the apm @xcite .",
    "this object also has been discovered independently by @xcite . first  0747 + 2739 has @xmath6 , not particularly red , but it is undetected on the blue palomar sky survey plate , yielding @xmath7 .",
    "the initial spectrum was obtained using the kast spectrograph on the lick observatory 3 m telescope .",
    "a higher signal - to - noise spectrum was obtained at keck observatory using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) , revealing a strikingly rich system of absorption lines redward of ly@xmath1 .",
    "first  0747 + 2739 is located at @xmath8 ( j2000 ) .",
    "there is a 2mass source within @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 magnitudes of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the peak @xmath16 flux density as measured by first @xcite is @xmath17 ; the integrated first flux density is @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by the lris spectrum , we obtained a high - dispersion spectrum of first  0747 + 2739 using the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; @xcite ) on the keck ii telescope on the night of 2000 april 6 .",
    "the night was photometric with @xmath19 seeing .",
    "a 900s high - resolution spectrum was taken through a @xmath20 slit in the echellette mode of esi . in this mode , the spectral range of @xmath21 to @xmath22 is covered in 10 spectral orders with a nearly constant dispersion of @xmath23 .",
    "the signal - to - noise of the spectrum ranges from 20 to 40 per pixel .",
    "wavelength calibrations were performed with observations of a cuar lamp .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard g191-b2b @xcite was observed for flux calibration .",
    "all observations were carried out at the parallactic angle .",
    "the data were reduced using a tailored set of iraf and idl routines developed by us specifically for esi data .",
    "the overdensity of absorption features in the spectrum of first  0747 + 2739 is immediately apparent in the keck esi data ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "also conspicuous are a weak trough - like feature near @xmath24 and two damped ly@xmath1 systems .",
    "the region longward of ly@xmath1 emission is plotted on an expanded scale in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we used an automated routine to search this spectral region for absorption lines with significance greater than @xmath25 .",
    "a total of 42 absorption line systems were identified , 34 being doublets , including a bal - like trough .",
    "the systems are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , which lists the system identification code , the redshift , the rest equivalent width of the blue and red components of the doublet ( if detected ) , the `` ejection '' velocity of the system , and other absorption species belonging to each system .",
    "the velocities are with respect to the quasar redshift and are given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "the individual systems are merged into 18 `` poisson '' systems ( 14 of which are ) by combining absorbers within @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "how unusual is the abundance of absorbers seen towards first  0747 + 2739 ? at high - redshift , @xcite found that ( based on 11 quasars ) the expected number of absorbers per unit redshift is approximately @xmath29 at @xmath30 for rest equivalent width larger than @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if we sum the equivalent widths of the each of the systems within @xmath33 , and ignore those three systems with @xmath34 , we find seven combined systems with rest equivalent widths larger than @xmath31 for both lines in the doublet . the path length searched for between ly@xmath1 emission and emission",
    "is @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 is @xmath36 for this line of sight  an excess of 12 standard deviations from the @xcite measurement .    for weak lines ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( based on four quasars ) .",
    "if we impose constraints on the @xcite data to match our more conservative @xmath25 significance limit and combine systems within @xmath40 , then the density reported by @xcite is reduced to @xmath41 . in our keck esi spectrum of first  0747 + 2739",
    "we find , using the same criteria , at least 9 distinct high - velocity systems . over the path length",
    "observed , that yields @xmath42 , which is a @xmath43 excess as compared to @xcite ; thus there is evidence that the overdensity of absorption may extend to weaker systems .    since @xcite and @xcite found that the density of absorption lines decreases with increasing redshift ( for strong lines ) and",
    "since the absorption systems found in first  0747 + 2739 are at higher redshifts than either the @xcite or @xcite samples , our observed density of lines may be even more significant .",
    "what can explain the large overdensity of absorption toward first  0747 + 2739 ?",
    "all possible explanations can be classified as intervening or intrinsic . in the intervening case ,",
    "the absorption lines arise from material associated with galaxies along the line of sight that have no relation to the quasar . in the intrinsic case ,",
    "the absorption is caused by high velocity ejecta from the quasar itself .",
    "the number density of strong lines towards this quasar is much larger than is normally observed .",
    "an examination of the spectra and tables from @xcite and @xcite along with a query of the @xcite catalog of quasar absorption lines reveals that such a concentration of absorption over such a long path length is extremely rare .",
    "none of the 11 high - redshift quasars from @xcite has a density of absorption higher than first  0747 + 2739 .",
    "two of the 55 lower redshift quasars from @xcite do have absorption line densities higher then first  0747 + 2739 ; q0013 - 004 ( um  224 ; @xmath44 ) and q0854 + 191 ( @xmath45 ) have six and seven strong ( @xmath46 ) `` poisson '' systems over path lengths of @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "quasars that have relatively high densities of absorption have created much interest in the search for signs of superclustering at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most of these quasars have absorption systems where the overdensity is very limited in its redshift range , such as cso  118 @xcite and the well - studied pks  0237@xmath48233 @xcite .",
    "first  074711.2 + 273904 is different in the sense that the overdensity of absorption is spread over a large redshift range ( @xmath5 )  much too large to be explained by a single supercluster .",
    "a search of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to look for other quasars to test the superclustering hypothesis found no other known quasars within 30 arcminutes , although there are five other radio sources within @xmath49 of first  0747 + 2739 .",
    "one possible way to reconcile the intervening hypothesis with the absorption line overdensity in first  0747 + 2739 is if the quasar is being gravitationally magnified by the intervening material .",
    "such magnification could occur without producing multiple images , and might help to explain why a quasar with @xmath50 is so bright .",
    "the possibility of compound microlensing of quasars by their absorption line systems is not a new concept @xcite .",
    "this object , however , is a point source in our nirc k - band image from keck observatory , obtained in 04 seeing .    finally , it is possible that the apparent overdensity of absorption systems in first  0747 + 2739 is either just chance coincidence , or is not actually all that uncommon .",
    "the number of high - redshift quasars that are well - studied for absorption is still quite small and additional investigations may yet turn up more cases like first  0747 + 2739 .",
    "such a finding would not necessarily be evidence for either the intrinsic or the intervening hypothesis , however .",
    "for now , we conclude that the nature of first  0747 + 2739 is highly unusual and next to impossible to reconcile with any picture where a significant number of the absorbing systems can be attributed to intervening objects unassociated with the quasar .      strong circumstantial evidence to support the intrinsic interpretation for the plethora of narrow , high - velocity absorption systems in first",
    "0747 + 2739 is the presence of similar , almost certainly intrinsic , absorption at low velocities relative to the quasar emission line frame .",
    "system s is typical of intrinsic absorption line systems seen in other quasars , exhibiting absorption and a small blueshift relative to the quasar s emission redshift .",
    "system q appears to be a weak bal - like outflow ; system p is also broad , but the blue and red components of the troughs are resolved .",
    "finally , system r , with a velocity of only @xmath51 km  s@xmath52 , may also be an intrinsic absorption system .",
    "there is ample evidence in the literature for the intrinsic interpretation of high - velocity non - bal outflows in quasars . @xcite and",
    "@xcite found weak , high - velocity , trough - like outflows ; @xcite showed that the outflows in q  2345 + 125 are intrinsic because the absorption profiles varied in @xmath53 months in the quasar rest frame . @xcite and",
    "@xcite give statistical evidence that some narrow , high - velocity absorption line systems may be intrinsic in nature .",
    "finally , @xcite discuss an overdensity of absorption in cso  118 .",
    "first  0747 + 2739 is similar to one of the quasars that comprise the so - called `` tololo pair '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , namely tol  1038@xmath482712 , which also has weak bal - like troughs .",
    "this well - studied pair is a favorite for superclustering studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since the two quasars appear to have common absorption line systems despite the rather large ( @xmath54 ) separation between the quasars .",
    "other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) still favor the hypothesis that both are balqsos and the absorption is from intrinsic high velocity outflow .",
    "the velocity separation of the lines in the tololo pair is reminiscent of the of the double - trough bal structure found by @xcite for balqsos in general , lending credence to the idea that the absorption lines in the tololo pair are intrinsic . in any case , the similarity of tol  1038@xmath482712 and first  0747 + 2739 may help lead to an understanding of the nature of the absorption in both systems .",
    "q1303 + 308 provides another interesting comparison ; because of its complex absorption structure , it has been classified as a balqso @xcite ; however , the absorption lines are all very narrow and do not meet the traditional bal criteria set forth largely by the same authors a few years later @xcite .",
    "one must then wonder , how we would classify an object with a slightly lower incidence of absorption than q1303 + 308 .",
    "such an object might simply be classified as a quasar with an overdensity of absorption line systems much like first  0747 + 2739",
    ".    the fashionable method of determining whether a particular absorption system is intrinsic is either to determine the `` coverage fraction '' of the quasar or to show that the absorption line system is variable @xcite . lacking the data to test for variability",
    ", we have analyzed the coverage fractions for each of our systems as a function of velocity .",
    "many of the high - velocity systems do indeed have coverage fractions that are consistent with the intrinsic hypothesis ; however , the majority of the systems are resolved into multiple components or blended , which means that the coverage fraction results are not entirely reliable .",
    "thus , on the basis of our covering fraction analysis alone , we are not able to confirm ( or exclude ) the possibility that the overdensity of absorption lines in this quasar spectrum is due to intrinsic absorption .",
    "regardless of the lack of conclusive evidence from variability or coverage fractions , the presence of trough - like absorption at moderate velocities and the large redshift span of the overdensity of the absorption points towards an intrinsic origin of at least some of the relatively narrow , high - velocity absorption systems .",
    "we suggest that first  0747 + 2739 is a quasar in transition from ( to ) a quasi - bal object to ( from ) a standard quasar .",
    "the lack of strong , broad absorption can be explained as being the result of one or more effects .",
    "as time goes on , it may be natural for the lines to become narrow as the clouds dissipate down to their small , dense cores ; or bal features might be a superposition of many narrow features and first  0747 + 2739 has a relatively low density of them ; or perhaps the many narrow absorbers can somehow be attributed to orientation effects .",
    "in summary , we find that that overdensity of absorption lines seen along the line of sight to first  0747 + 2739 is sufficiently high that it is likely that at least some of these systems are high - velocity , intrinsic absorption systems .",
    "the presence of weak trough - like absorption features suggests that first  0747 + 2739 may be a transitional bal quasar that is being observed at a brief phase in its transition to ( or from ) a standard quasar , or is being viewed at a highly specific orientation , or that it is a bal with a very low absorber density .",
    "if the absorption is intrinsic , monitoring with high resolution spectroscopy over the course of @xmath55 months may reveal variability of the absorbers , a signature of intrinsic absorption .",
    "confirmation ( or exclusion ) of the intrinsic hypothesis for the unusually large number of high - velocity systems in first  0747 + 2739 would have interesting consequences for absorption line studies , particularly high - redshift superclustering studies .",
