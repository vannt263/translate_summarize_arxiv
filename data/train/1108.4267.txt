    "their method entailed the construction of an infinite dimensional , finitely generated nil graded algebra @xmath22 by carefully adding relators ; the elements of the form @xmath23 for @xmath24 in the generating set of @xmath22 generate an infinite torsion group .",
    "their construction is quite flexible , and has been generalized in various directions to obtain more information on the _ growth _ of @xmath22 , which we now define .",
    "let @xmath22 be an associative algebra generated by a finite dimensional subspace @xmath25 .",
    "then the _ growth _ of @xmath22 is the function @xmath26 .",
    "this depends upon @xmath25 , but only mildly : if @xmath27 be another generating subspace for @xmath22 , then the corresponding growth function @xmath28 is related to @xmath29 by the inequalities @xmath30 for some constant @xmath31 .",
    "we write @xmath32 if one , and @xmath33 if both of the inequalities above are satisfied ; then the equivalence class of @xmath29 is independent of @xmath25 .",

    "56 define a slightly weaker relation , based on the inequalities @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; our results hold for both . )",
    "the algebra @xmath22 has _ polynomial _ growth if @xmath36 for some @xmath37 ; the infimal @xmath37 such that @xmath36 is the _ gelfand - kirillov _ dimension of @xmath22 .",

    "growth if no such @xmath37 exists , it has _ exponential _ growth if @xmath38 and _ subexponential _ growth otherwise .    the groups and the algebras constructed by the golod - shafarevich method have exponential growth .",
    "much later , gromov  @xcite proved that under the assumption that the group has polynomial growth , the answer to the burnside problem is positive .",
    "in fact , he proved that a finitely generated group with polynomial growth has a nilpotent normal subgroup of finite index .",
    "as a consequence , if a finitely generated group has polynomial growth and each element has finite order then the group is finite .",
    "zelmanov asked in  @xcite*problem  5 whether golod - shafarevich algebras always have infinite dimensional homomorphic images with polynomial growth .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that this is not the case .",
    "the same was shown for golod - shafarevich groups by ershov  @xcite  there exist golod - shafarevich groups without infinite images of polynomial growth ; indeed there exist golod - shafarevich groups satisfying kazhdan s property  ( t ) .",

    "[ cor : gosha ] with the same assumptions and notations as in theorem  [ thm : gosha ] , if we assume @xmath58 for almost all @xmath46 , then @xmath56 can be mapped onto an infinite dimensional algebra with at most quadratic growth .",

    "let @xmath44 be the free associative algebra on the set of free generators @xmath59 over a field @xmath39 .",

    "we therefore obtain an affirmative answer to the following    is it true that every golod - shafarevich algebra has an infinite dimensional homomorphic image of finite gelfand - kirillov dimension , under the additional assumption that the number of relations is small and the relations have sparse degrees ?",
    "we remark that alexander young obtained related results , but for special types of ideals with repeated patterns , called _",

    "the ideal @xmath81 that we consider does not suffer from such restrictions .",
    "more generally , we may wish to construct algebras of prescribed growth in which a predetermined set of relations have already been imposed . in this sense",
    ", we are able to achieve finite gelfand - kirillov dimension when the relations are in appropriately separated degrees .",
    "according to gromov s result mentioned above , if a group has polynomial growth then its growth function is @xmath82 for an integer @xmath37 .",
    "grigorchuk showed in  @xcite that there exist semigroups of growth strictly between polynomial and exponential ; closely related examples  @xcite have growth @xmath83 for various @xmath84 , accumulating to @xmath10 .",
    "one of the tantalizing open problems is the existence of groups of intermediate growth strictly between polynomial and @xmath85 .",
    "which functions are the growth function of an associative algebra ?",
    "an obvious restriction is that the growth function must be submultiplicative ( since any @xmath86-fold product of generators can be factored as an @xmath87-fold product times an @xmath24-fold product ) . for every real number @xmath88 ,",
    "there exists a finitely generated algebra with gelfand - kirillov dimension @xmath84 ; see  @xcite .",
    "we address the question of constructing algebras of superpolynomial growth :    [ thm : arbitrary ]",
    "let @xmath89 be submultiplicative and increasing , that is , @xmath90 for all @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "then there exists a finitely generated algebra @xmath93 whose growth function @xmath94 satisfies @xmath95 furthermore , @xmath93 may be chosen to be a monomial algebra .",

    "note that the hypotheses are satisfied by any sufficiently regular function that grows at least as fast as @xmath99 .",
    "the results in  @xcite therefore hold for a very large class of growth functions .",
    "it remains open whether arbitrary functions between polynomial and @xmath99 can be realized as the growth of an algebra .",
    "the proofs of theorems  [ thm : gosha ] and  [ thm : arbitrary ] are closely related : in both cases , good control is achieved on certain subspaces of monomials in degree a power of two , which represent ( in a strong sense ) linearly independent elements in the algebra we are about to construct ; then the properties of these subspaces are carried over to all degrees .",
    "our construction is elementary , and bears resemblance to zelmanov s construction of a prime algebra with a nonzero locally nilpotent ideal  @xcite .",
    "we do not know if our algebras are prime .      in what follows",
    ", @xmath39 is an algebraically closed field ( this is needed because we will apply hilbert s nullstellensatz ) . by @xmath44",
    "we denote the free @xmath39-algebra in two non - commuting indeterminates @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the set of monomials in @xmath102 is denoted by @xmath103 and , for each @xmath104 , its subset of monomials of degree @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath105 .",
    "thus , @xmath106 and for @xmath107 the elements in @xmath105 are of the form @xmath108 with all @xmath109 .",
    "the span of @xmath105 in @xmath44 is denoted by @xmath110 ; its elements are called _ homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath46_. more generally , for any subset @xmath67 of @xmath44 , we denote by @xmath111 its subset of homogeneous elements of degree @xmath46 .",
    "the _ degree _ @xmath112 of an element @xmath113 is the least @xmath114 such that @xmath115 .",
    "any @xmath79 can be uniquely written in the form @xmath116 with each @xmath117 . the elements @xmath118 are the _ homogeneous components _ of @xmath119 .",
    "a ( right , left , two - sided ) ideal of @xmath44 is _ homogeneous _ if it is spanned by its elements homogeneous components .",
    "if @xmath120 is a linear space over @xmath39 , we denote by @xmath121 the dimension of @xmath120 over @xmath39 . the gelfand - kirillov dimension of an algebra @xmath22",
    "is written @xmath122 .",
    "for elementary properties of gelfand - kirillov dimension we refer to  @xcite .    for any real number @xmath100 ,",
    "define @xmath123 as the largest integer at most @xmath100 , and @xmath124 as the smallest integer at least @xmath100 .",
    "all logarithms are in base @xmath125 .",
    "its proof is an intricate induction , which we broadly explain here .",
    "we are given a collection of subspaces @xmath126 , namely a graded subspace @xmath127 of @xmath44 ; these are relations that will hold in the algebra we are about to construct .",
    "we construct auxiliary graded subspaces @xmath128 of @xmath44 ; the spaces @xmath129 vanish except in dimensions a power of two .",
    "they have the following informal meaning :    * elements of @xmath130 are chunks , with length a power of two , of the relations we want to impose ; in degrees a power of two , we have @xmath131 ; * elements of @xmath132 are chunks , with length a power of two , of the ideal generated by @xmath130 .",
    "they are complemented , in @xmath44 , by the spaces @xmath120 .",
    "we therefore have , again in degrees a power of two , @xmath133 and @xmath134 and @xmath135 and @xmath136 ; * roughly speaking , @xmath137 is the largest ideal contained ( in degrees a power of two ) in @xmath138 ; so we have @xmath139 .",
    "the construction , based on looking at chunks of relations in degrees a power of two , makes the combinatorics tractable ; on the other hand , it does not allow very tight control on the growth of the resulting algebra @xmath140 .",
    "it is nevertheless sufficient to control the gelfand - kirillov dimension of @xmath140 , which has a basis made of products of appropriate monomials from a basis of @xmath120 .",
    "the following is a more precise road map of where the various spaces @xmath128 are constructed , and where their various properties are proven :    * in   [ ss : f ] , subspaces @xmath141 of @xmath142 are constructed , depending on splittings @xmath143 for @xmath144 and on the subspaces @xmath45 for @xmath145 . roughly speaking , for @xmath146",

    "they satisfy @xmath152 . * still in   [ ss : uv ] , for all @xmath153 , we set @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the desired quotient is then @xmath140 . * in   [ ss : gk ] , we bound the gelfand - kirillov dimension of @xmath140 .",
    "let us now give a concrete example how the construction works using simple sets @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",
    "we take @xmath158 , and for all @xmath50 , set @xmath159 , and let @xmath160 be spanned by all monomials of degree @xmath161 which contain both @xmath100 and @xmath101 . by the definition of @xmath137 , we see that @xmath162 for all @xmath50 , because @xmath163 ; similarly @xmath164 .",
