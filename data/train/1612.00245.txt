    "dust attenuates the light of background objects , it is a key ingredient in the process of star formation and plays relevant roles in mechanisms of cooling and spreading out of metals in galaxies .",
    "the presence of dust in the interstellar media of the milky way has been known since nearly a century ago , and its emission mapped with relatively good sensitivity and angular detail by the satellites iras @xcite and cobe dirbe @xcite . from those maps , @xcite built a map of optical extinction in the milky way that has been widely used .",
    "although dust is routinely detected in extragalactic environments , the existence of dust in intracluster media ( icm ) is still a matter under discussion .",
    "there are several processes that expel dust out of the galaxies , and some of them which involve the presence of at least two galaxies , like ram pressure stripping or mergers , are probably more common within clusters of galaxies",
    ". however , it is unclear if such continuous or episodic injection of dust is enough to compensate the hard conditions found by dust particles in the icm environment , where the media is dominated by hot gas , and then a relatively fast sputtering of dust grains which seems to dominate over the accretion of dust particles .",
    "first searches for icm dust were considered in the seminal work by @xcite , having since then a long history of detection and refutation .",
    "two different approaches have been traditionally used : several groups compared the possible additional attenuation of light with respect to the field and subsequent reddening of objects in the background of clusters .",
    "some of the best limits on this effect have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) with upper limits on that additional extinction @xmath8 of the order of a few milimags .",
    "other works follow a different line trying to measure directly the emission from icm dust in the far infrared and radio . due to the small signals expected , it has been used in general a statistical approach averaging the contribution of many clusters ( montier & giard 2005 ; giard et al .",
    "2008 ; paper i ) , although estimations based on single clusters also exist @xcite .",
    "some of the results claiming for a detection are controversial , and there is a broad consensus to interpret them as upper limits on the presence of dust in the icm .    in paper",
    "i we used a large sample of clusters obtained from the sloan digital sky survey , sdss @xcite complemented at low redshift with the list of abell clusters with known redshifts , the catalog of sdss galaxies with photometric redshift estimations , and the @xcite extinction map . in that paper",
    "we follow the two methods outlined above ; on the one hand we stacked and averaged the schlegel et al .",
    "maps centered in all the clusters of the sample , applying standard aperture photometry in which the average extinction from the milky way was averaged and subtracted .",
    "this procedure also removed any other possible emission in angular scales much larger than those of the clusters .",
    "alternatively , we compared the colors of sdss galaxies with photometric redshifts in the background of such clusters with other galaxies at similar redshifts projected through _ clear _ lines of sights .",
    "both methods give compatible results : a maximum extinction due to the icm of a few milimags , and upper limits on the dust fraction in the icm of @xmath9 of the total mass of the cluster .",
    "however , as it was noted in paper i , there are two major drawbacks that hinder that analysis : firstable , the relatively poor angular resolution ( @xmath10 arcmin ) of the extinction map that prevents the separation of the possible component originated in the icm from those coming directly from galaxy members of the clusters , and secondly the relatively large uncertainties in the photometric redshifts of sdss galaxies that make impossible in the majority of the cases assess the relative situation through the line of sight of galaxies with respect to the clusters .    in this second paper , we use the same sdss based catalog of clusters , whilst as tracers of the infrared emission of such clusters , we select the recently released herschel maps and catalogs of the hermes project . these comprise maps centered at three wavelengths , 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m , and have much better spatial resolution than the iras and dirbe maps .",
    "the combination of those maps and the corresponding catalogs of sources allows to estimate tighter upper limits on the icm fluxes by subtracting from the total emission of the clusters , the contribution of cataloged sources , or by using the position of these sources to identify specific regions of the maps projected along the line of sight of a given cluster , free of bright sources ( those included in the catalogs ) .",
    "this , in conjunction with the much better sensitivity of herschel as compared to iras or dirbe , largely compensates the small sky area covered by the hermes project .",
    "the goals of this paper are the following : i/ to determine the total emission of the clusters at observed wavelengths of 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m , ii/ to estimate the fraction of these signals due to dust in the icm , iii/ to set upper limits on the extinction produced by such icm in the light of background objects , iv/ to study how these magnitudes change with redshift and/or mass of the cluster , and v/ to determine how the total infrared luminosity and therefore , the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the clusters evolve with redshift . to avoid duplication ,",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for a more detailed description of the samples and methodology used . here",
    ", we focus on those aspects that have changed from that paper or are entirely new .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 1 corresponds to this introduction ; section 2 describes the properties of the samples used , the restrictions applied to get the final subsamples , and the methodology ; section 3 presents the main results ; section 4 considers the evolution with mass and redshift ; whilst section  5 compares our results with those previously found ; finally conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "the catalog of clusters used is the one by @xcite as it was done in the main analysis of paper i. basically , it is a sdss based catalog that contains 132,684 clusters with photometric redshifts between 0.05 and 0.8 .",
    "the catalog is above 95% complete for clusters with @xmath11 up to redshift 0.42 . for each cluster ,",
    "the parameters needed for the analysis done in this paper are the angular position in the sky in right ascension and declination , the photometric estimation of redshift , and the mass as estimated from the number and luminosity of member galaxies of the clusters . according to the authors of the catalog , the uncertainties in photometric redshifts are @xmath12 for those clusters at redshifts @xmath13 , and slightly larger for clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "although some of the clusters have spectroscopic redshifts , in order to use the whole catalog in a consistent way , we decided to use the photometric estimation of redshifts ( even in those cases in which spectroscopic redshifts were available ) .    for the estimation of the infrared emission",
    ", we have used the herschel spire @xcite maps @xcite and catalogs @xcite at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m corresponding to the second data release of the herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ) project described in @xcite .",
    "the data from the herschel mission have angular resolution of 17.6 , 23.9 and 35.2 arcsecs at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m respectively . for most of the analysis presented in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the three maps independently .",
    "the maximum angular resolution of such maps ( 17.6 arcsecs at 250 @xmath0 m ) translates into spatial resolutions 15 - 130 kpc , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . ] for clusters in the range of redshifts 0.05 - 0.8 . as hermes covers only a small fraction of the whole sky , the large majority of the wen et al .",
    "clusters are not within the area observed by that project . from the list of 23 maps available in the hermes second data release ( dr2 ) ,",
    "we have selected those fields that map the region around at least 10 clusters of the wen et al . catalog .",
    "after several tests , we decided to exclude from the analysis also the field l2-cosmos due to its relatively high noise as compared to the rest of the maps selected .",
    "the final selection is listed in table  1 which shows the name of the fields ( column 1 ) and their nominal equatorial coordinates ( columns 2 and 3 ) . in each of the maps , we discard for the analysis a small section that corresponds to edge regions that have not been homogeneously covered ; this is done by selecting a region defined by a circle centered approximately in the center of each field , and with the radius indicated in the fourth column of table  1 .",
    "the number of clusters within each of the fields is listed in column 5 . in total",
    ", this study uses 37 square degrees of hermes maps and 327 clusters ( in addition , 18 clusters projected in the field of l2-cosmos and 13 disseminated through other hermes fields were not used in this work ) . to estimate the emission originated in member galaxies of the clusters , we use the catalog obtained by the hermes team .",
    "the number of detected sources in the 250 @xmath0 m channel within a 5 arcmin radius from the center of the clusters is presented in the last column of table  1 .",
    "the density of sources projected at clustercentric distances up to 5 arcmin is about 27% higher than at distances @xmath16 arcmin , demonstrating that part of the sources correspond to member galaxies of the clusters .    fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] presents an example of one of the hermes maps ( l6-xmm - lss - swire at 250 @xmath0 m ) used in our analysis .",
    "it is shown ( left panel ) the map and the positions of the clusters detected in the wen et al .",
    "catalog ; the panel on the right shows a zoom of the map , with two circles of 5 arcmin radius centered in the position of two clusters , and the sources detected in the hermes catalog .",
    "through the line of sight of a given cluster , the hermes maps contain the contribution from diffuse and point source emissions in the milky way , sources ( galaxies ) members of the clusters , field foreground and background galaxies , any other hypothetical component on superclusters scales , and the possible emission from icm .",
    "to separate the emission of the clusters from the rest of contributors , we follow a statistical approach in which the flux in the angular region projected through each cluster is computed in clustercentric coordinates , and therefore by stacking the emission from many clusters , gradients or spatial irregularities from the rest of contributors ( that obviously are uncorrelated with the position of the clusters ) are largely filtered out .",
    "so , these contaminants can be considered as a spatially uniform background , and subtracted by measuring them in a region far enough from the central position of the cluster .",
    "the procedure also smooths any possible spatial asymmetries or irregularities in the emission profile of the clusters , and then in the stacked maps we can ignore any angular dependence and consider only the radial profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( left ) shows the radial profiles of the average flux per cluster obtained by stacking the signal in the 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m channels for the whole 327 clusters in our sample .",
    "the emissions from the clusters are clearly detected in each channel , have a maximum in the center , and show clear declining radial dependences up to @xmath17 arcmin from the center , whilst from 5 arcmin onwards remain nearly flat .",
    "the contribution from contaminants ( any other signal apart from the clusters ) can be estimated and subtracted by averaging the signal at distances @xmath16 arcmin from the center of the clusters . the signal obtained after",
    "such subtraction is our best estimation for the mean emission of the clusters in the whole sample .",
    "although considering larger radius would prevent for removing possible contribution from outskirts of the clusters , in practice the larger area considered and the comparatively low fluxes would largely increase the uncertainty in these estimations .",
    "the spatial profiles of the signals are the result of the convolution of the psfs of the herschel maps with the angular extension of the clusters .",
    "gaussian fits to the inner part ( @xmath18 arcmin ) of the radial profiles ( solid lines in figure  [ fig2 ] ) give fwhms of 56 , 65 and 72 arcsecs for the channels at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "these values are clearly larger than the corresponding instrumental resolutions , and then indicate that the clusters are resolved in the maps .",
    "the mean redshift of the sample is 0.37 , which corresponds to an angular scale @xmath10 kpc arcsec@xmath19 , and then radius in the range @xmath20 arcmin correspond to linear scales of @xmath21 mpc .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] ( lines labelled @xmath22 ) shows the integrated fluxes within such range of radius . the signal is higher in the high frequency channel , as it is expected for dust with properties similar to the milky way . some additional uncertainty on the estimation of the total flux results from the bumps in the radial profile centered at @xmath23 arcmin ; these produce a considerable increase of the integrated fluxes from radius 2 to 4 arcmin .",
    "these bumps interrupt the decline of the profile with radius , and could be the result of the contribution of a set of clusters with particularly extended profiles , or alternatively the result of fluctuations in the background .",
    "obvious upper limits for any of the two components ( galaxies and icm ) are given by the total emission of the clusters in each channel .",
    "however , the sensitivity and spatial resolution of hermes allows partially separate and put tighter constraints on the relative contribution of both components . to do",
    "that , we checked if some of the member galaxies of the clusters can be detected in the hermes maps .",
    "instead of building our own catalog of sources from the maps , we have used those released by the hermes group ; in particular , those obtained using the starfinder program .",
    "following @xcite that program is particularly useful deblending and identifying faint sources in crowded fields as by construction galaxy clusters are .",
    "in general , we do not have information about the redshift of those sources and then it is not possible to assess if a source projected along the line of sight of a given cluster is a member or not of such cluster . therefore , as it has been done for the maps",
    ", we used a statistical approach stacking and averaging the contribution of such sources in clustercentric coordinates . after subtracting a constant background estimated from the emission within radius @xmath16 arcmin from the cluster centers ,",
    "we have obtained the radial profiles presented in the right panels of fig .",
    "these profiles indicate that some of the sources detected are members of the clusters , and by comparing with the profiles of the total emission , that an important fraction of the emission originated in the cluster comes from these bright discrete sources ( galaxies ) .",
    "two estimations of the total flux from a direct integration of the profiles are presented in table  [ tab2 ] ( lines labelled @xmath24 ) .",
    "the fwhms of gaussian fits to the inner parts @xmath25 arcmin ) of the radial profiles are 38 , 51 and 49 arcsecs at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m respectively .",
    "these fluxes contain only the contribution from bright galaxies in the clusters ( those bright enough to have been detected and cataloged ) , so they can be considered as lower limits to the total contribution from galaxies within the clusters .",
    "the radial profiles of the fluxes due to the cataloged sources are narrower than the corresponding profiles obtained from the maps .",
    "this could be indicative for the presence of some icm contribution in the outskirts of the cluster or merely a consequence of segregation of galaxies , i. e. prevalence of low luminosity , and then uncataloged sources , in the external regions of the clusters .",
    "the contribution from the icm can be constrained subtracting from the total emission of the cluster the part that is originated in galaxies . to do that we follow two different estimations ( named a and b respectively ) .",
    "both provide upper limits on the possible emission of the icm because both estimations include the contribution of sources with fluxes below the sensitivity of the catalog . to subtract the contribution of such sources it would be needed to assumme specific parameters for the luminosity function of galaxies and how they evolve with redshift .",
    "this will be considered in a future paper ( gutirrez et al . in preparation ) .",
    "* estimation a : * an upper limit on the contribution by the icm is obtained by subtracting from the total emission of the cluster ( line @xmath22 in table  [ tab2 ] ) the contribution of galaxies ( line @xmath24 in table  [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] presents the normalized radial profiles of the fluxes in pixels within distances of 5 arcmin of any cluster , as a function of the projected distance to the nearest source in the hermes catalogs .",

    "[ fig3 ] for the 250 @xmath0 m channel , we obtain a fwhm of 16.6 arcsecs as a rough estimation of the _ mean _ extension of the sources .",
    "in the unrealistic case of all the galaxies being at the mean redshift of the sample of clusters ( @xmath27 ) , that angular extension would correspond to a gaussian profile with @xmath28 kpc . this is a very crude and biased estimation , because for a given luminosity and radial profile , galaxies at lower redshift will contribute more to the flux , and in practice galaxies spread over a broad distribution of luminosities and profiles which evolve with redshift .",

    "we have obtained the results of table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "masses of dust are shown in terms of solar masses and in terms of the total mass of the clusters as estimated by wen et al .",

    "it would be interesting to investigate this in the future with more herschel data , in order to see if some systematics is present in the estimation of fluxes , or the results just show particularities in the evolution of high mass clusters at intermediate redshifts . excluding that bin from the analysis",

    "the little dependence of @xmath67 with mass indicates a specific star formation rate , @xmath111 anticorrelated with mass ( excluding the intermediate redshift high mass bin , we obtain @xmath112 ) . this anticorrelation support , as many other authors have shown in the past ( e. g. @xcite that the declining of @xmath93 in clusters with time is not merely a consequence of accretion of galaxies with less @xmath93 at a given cosmic time , but instead it is also a consequence of internal processes in the clusters .",
    "a similar approach to our method b was used by @xcite and applied to iso data at 70 and 160 @xmath0 m in the coma cluster .",
    "these authors obtained @xmath113 mag within the central 100 kpc of the cluster .",
    "it is not possible to conduct a direct comparison between their results and our findings ( tables  4 and 5 ) due to the use of different samples , and the slightly different way to estimate the extinctions .",
    "however , both results point out to a very small extinction within the central parts of the clusters , being our upper limits an order of magnitude tighter",
    ". we also improve by roughly and order of magnitude the constraints obtained by @xcite .",
    "our results are also compatible and improve the limits ( @xmath114 mags on 1 mpc scales ) found by the @xcite .",
    "the differential extinction found in the analysis by @xcite from the differential reddening of galaxies in the background of clusters found in the analysis by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) seems to occur at clustercentric distances @xmath115 .",
    "as was noted in paper i , our results are difficult to fit with those by @xcite who analyzed a sample of low redshift groups and clusters , and found extinctions @xmath116 mag on scales @xmath117 mpc . at the mean redshift of our sample , 5 arcmin subtends @xmath118 mpc , and assumming a linear decrease of dust attenuation with clustercentric distance , the results by such authors ( see their fig . 4 ) would correspond to @xmath119 mag .",
    "this is still about one order of magnitude smaller that the typical values quoted in our table 4 .",
    "although fig . 4 by mcgee et al .",
    "seems indicate a shallower behaviour of the differential extinction in the very inner parts of the cluster , it is difficult a strong assesment on this due to the low angular / spatial resolution of such results .    comparing with the results presented in paper i , the use of three frequencies , and the best sensitivity and spatial resolution of the hermes maps with respect to iras , largely compensates the smaller spatial coverage ( and then the numbers of clusters used ) in the present work . considering as representative of the results obtained in paper i , the 95% upper limit of @xmath120 milimags found within the central 1 mpc , the constraints presented here ( table  [ tab4 ] )",
    "improve that by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "our results qualitative agree with many previous works that have estimated the infrared luminosity up to redshift @xmath61 .",
    "they show a strong increase of luminosity , and therefore @xmath93 , with redshift , in the field , in groups and in clusters , being unclear whether or not the evolution is similar in any of these environments .",
    "although it is difficult to establish rigurous comparison due to the different methods , samples , and redshifts covered , the evolution found in the present work is stronger than the dependence @xmath121 found by @xcite in field galaxies up to @xmath61 found by spitzer @xcite in the chandra deep field south .",
    "other authors , @xcite have found in field galaxies a stronger dependence in luminosity with redshift @xmath122 that agrees better with our results .",
    "we qualitatively agree also with the findings by @xcite and @xcite who found increase in luminosity with redshift in groups and clusters with masses in the ranges @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively , and with the strong evolution in luminosity found also by @xcite comparing local and high redshift ( @xmath125 ) clusters .",
    "@xcite by analyzing herschel - spire maps and the planck early release compact sources catalog @xcite identified and estimated the luminosities and @xmath126 of four candidates to be clusters of galaxies at redshifts @xmath127 .",
    "although these sources correspond likely to very extreme cases that are not representative of the average values found in the analysis of wen et al clusters , their own existence points towards an increase in luminosity , and therefore in @xmath93 , very strong at least up to redshift @xmath128 .",
    "constraints on the icm emission at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m have been obtained using a sample of 327 clusters of galaxies spanning ranges of 0.05 - 0.7 in redshift and @xmath129 in mass , and maps and catalogs of sources at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m from the herschel hermes project .",
    "the main results are :    1 .",
    "subtracting from the whole emission of the cluster the contribution of identified sources , it has been estimated 95% upper limits on the icm emission per cluster of 86.6 , 48.2 and 30.9 mjy in the maps at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0 m respectively within a 5 arcmin radius centered in each cluster .",
    "these correspond to surface emission of @xmath130 , @xmath37 , and @xmath131 mjy str@xmath19 respectively .",
    "2 .   assuming for the intracluster dust typical values found within the milky way ( a temperature of 20 k , and an emissivity @xmath76 ) , we have obtained strong upper limits on the visual extinction of background objects due to the icm . from the fluxes at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath0",
    "m these restrictions are respectively @xmath132 0.4 , 0.4 and 0.6 milimags within projected distance of 5 arcmin from the cluster centers . separating the clusters in 3 x 2 bins in redshift and mass respectively ,",
    "the constraints on the extinctions are of the order of 1 milimag in any of the ranges in redshift and mass considered .",
    "tight upper limits are also obtained on the dust mass in the icm ; for instance using the data at 350 @xmath0 m we set a 95% upper limit of @xmath133 within a projected 5 arcmin radius circle centered in the clusters .",
    "this corresponds to a fraction of the total mass of the clusters of @xmath3 .",
    "4 .   from the results obtained in the three channels , we have estimated @xmath67 and its dependence of the far infrared luminosity with redshift and mass .",
    "although there are many assumptions and the estimations are slightly model dependent , the overall results show a clear and strong dependence with redshift @xmath134 , whilst the dependence with mass is not so obvious indicating an anticorrelation of @xmath135 with the mass of the cluster . using the linear relation between @xmath67 and @xmath93 ,",
    "the results indicate a declining by roughly an order of magnitude in @xmath93 in a period of @xmath7 gyr .",
    "the specific @xmath93 is clearly anticorrelated with mass ; this indicates that internal mechanisms play a role on this quenching of @xmath93 .",
    "this research has made use of data from hermes project ( http://hermes.sussex.ac.uk/ ) .",
