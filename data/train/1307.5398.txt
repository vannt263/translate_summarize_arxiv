    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation with several variables is important in quantum mechanics , atomic and nuclear physics , wave physics , microelectronics and nanotechnologies , etc .",

    "its advantages are the complete absence of spurious reflections , reliable computational stability , clear mathematical background and corresponding rigorous stability theory .    concerning finite - difference schemes in several space variables with the discrete tbcs , the standard crank - nicolson scheme in the case of an infinite ( or semi - infinite )",

    "all the schemes are implicit , and solving of specific complex systems of linear algebraic equations is required at each time level .",
    "efficient methods to solve similar systems are well developed by the moment in real situation but not the complex one .",

    "the strang - type splitting with respect to the potential ( but not to the space directions ) has been recently applied to the crank - nicolson scheme with the discrete tbc in @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that higher order methods are often able to reduce computational costs significantly . in this paper , we apply the strang - type splitting in potential to the numerov - crank - nicolson scheme and get a higher order in space method with the discrete tbc . to study its stability and construct the discrete tbc , we first consider the splitting numerov - crank - nicolson scheme on an infinite space mesh in the semi - infinite strip .",
    "its uniform in time @xmath0-stability together with the mass conservation law are proved .",
    "the discrete tbc allows to restrict in a rigorous sense the solution of the latter scheme to a finite space mesh .",
    "our form of the discrete tbc is different from ( though equivalent to ) one for the original numerov - crank - nicolson scheme in @xcite .",
    "its presented derivation based on results in @xcite is more direct and shorter ( we skip an intermediate step dealing with the computationally unstable form of the discrete tbc ) . notice that the explicit form of the discrete tbc is non - local and involves the discrete convolution in time as well as the discrete fourier expansion in direction @xmath1 perpendicular to the strip .",
