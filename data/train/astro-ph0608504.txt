    "temperatures , luminosities and radii are amongst the basic physical data against which models of stellar structure and evolution are tested . in this paper , we address one particular area of the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , that of the g and k dwarfs  focusing particularly on stars for which the effects of stellar evolution have been negligible or nearly negligible during their lifetimes .",
    "somewhat higher mass stars than those considered here have been extensively studied historically because their luminosities may be used to infer stellar ages .",
    "lower mass stars of late - g to k spectral types , have been neglected to some extent , probably because there have been few secondary benefits in getting stellar models right for these stars , and the lack of good parallax , diameter and other data .",
    "this situation is rapidly changing : firstly , hipparcos has provided the requisite parallax data ; secondly , interferometric techniques are making the measurement of diameters for such small stars likely to be routine within a few years ; thirdly , we have our own motivation in the form of an ongoing project to follow the chemical history of the milky way from lower mass stars , for which we can infer indirectly the amount of their constituent helium via stellar luminosity ( jimenez et al 2003 ) . in order to achieve our goals , we need accurate and homogeneous effective temperatures and luminosities for our g+k dwarfs .    the effective temperature of a stellar surface is a measure of the total energy , integrated over all wavelengths , radiated from a unit of surface area . since its value",
    "is fixed by the luminosity and radius , it is readily calculated for theoretical stellar models , and as one of the coordinates of the physical hr diagram , it plays a central role in discussions of stellar evolution .",
    "most observations , however , provide spectroscopic or photometric indicators of temperature that are only indirectly related to the effective temperature .    the effective temperature of lower main sequence stars is not easy to determine and different measurement techniques are still far from satisfactory concordance ( e.g. mishenina & kovtyukh 2001 , kovtyukh et al .",
    "2003 ) . at present , spectroscopic temperature determinations return values that are some 100  k hotter that most of the other techniques . even in a restricted and thoroughly studied region like that of the solar analogs ,",
    "effective temperature determinations for the same star still differ significantly , by as much as 150  k ( soubiran & triaud , 2004 ) .",
    "models predict values that are some 100  k hotter than those measured ( lebreton et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "in this work , we apply the infrared flux method to multi - band @xmath1 photometry of a carefully selected sample of g and k dwarf stars .",
    "we compare observed with synthetic broad - band colours computed from up - to - date ( 1d ) model atmospheres .",
    "such models are then used to estimate the missing flux needed to recover bolometric luminosities from our photometry .",
    "other than the high quality of the observational data , the strength of this work relies on using very few basic assumptions : these are the adopted vega absolute calibration and zero - points .",
    "this also makes clearer the evaluation of possible errors and/or biases in the results .",
    "both the absolute calibration and the zero - points are expected to be well known and the latest generations of model atmospheres produce realistic fluxes for a wide range of temperatures , gravities and abundances ( bessell 2005 ) so that the adopted model and calibration are at the best level currently available .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe our sample ; we compare different libraries of model atmospheres with observational data in section 3 and in section 4 we present our implementation of the infrared flux method along with the resulting temperature scale . in section 5",
    "we test our scale with empirical data for the sun and solar analogs and with recent interferometric measurements of dwarf stars .",
    "the comparison with other temperature determinations is done in section 6 and in section 7 and 8 we give bolometric calibrations and useful tight relations between angular diameters and photometric indices .",
    "we conclude in section 9 .",
    "the bulk of the targets has been selected from the sample of nearby stars in the northern hemisphere provided by gray et al .",
    "our initial sample consisted of 186 g and k dwarfs with hipparcos parallaxes for which the relative error is less than 14% .",
    "accurate @xmath2 broadband photometry has been obtained for the bulk of the stars at la palma , with additional photometry adopted from bessell ( 1990a ) , reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and percival , salaris & kilkenny ( 2003 ) .",
    "all our stars have accurate spectroscopic metallicities and for most of them also @xmath3element abundances .",
    "our sample is neither volume nor magnitude limited , but it gives a good coverage of the properties of local g and k dwarfs from low to high metallicity ( figure [ logg ] ) .",
    "the sample has been cleaned of a number of contaminants , reducing it to a final sample of 104 stars , as described in the following sections .",
    "particular attention has been paid to removing unresolved double / multiple stars .",
    "these stars primarily affect spectroscopic and photometric measurements , making the system appear brighter and redder .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue was used to make a prior exclusion of certain , possible and suspected ( i.e. _ good , fair , poor , uncertain _ and _ suspected _ ) multiple systems , on the basis of the quality of the multflag field in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "some unrecognized double / multiple stars almost certainly remain in the sample , since a few stars are found in a binary main sequence above the bulk of the main sequence , as kotoneva , flynn & jimenez ( 2002 ) suspected in such data but were unable to prove .",
    "a new technique for identifying binaries / multiples has been introduced by wielen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , termed the @xmath4 method , which indicates the presence of multiple unresolved systems by using the difference between the near - instantaneous direction of the proper motion of the star(s ) as measured by the hipparcos satellite , and the direction of the ground based proper motion measured over much longer time scales .",
    "most of the suspect stars in the kotoneva , flynn & jimenez ( 2002 ) sample turned out to be @xmath4 multiples , and we have excluded those stars which are likely @xmath4 multiples also from the present sample ( @xmath4 classifications were kindly made for our sample stars by christian dettbarn in heidelberg ) .",
    "this reduced the sample to 134 stars .",
    "we have retained widely separated binary systems in the sample where components could be studied separately .",
    "these were retained by making a prior cross - checking of our sample with the catalogue of wide - binary and multiple systems of poveda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and then verifying the separation of such systems by inspecting our own or simbad images .",
    "13 such stars have been retained .",
    "even if dwarfs stars are not expected to show signs of strong variability , the existence of @xmath5 or more hipparcos measurements per star spread over several years , together with the excellent temporal stability of the magnitude scales , allows the detection of variability at the level of few hundredths of a magnitude ( brown et al .",
    "1997 ) in hipparcos targets .",
    "we use the hipparcos classification to remove so - called duplicity induced variables , periodic variables , unsolved variables and possible micro - variables. this removed a total of 26 stars ( however 8 of these were already removed as non - single stars ) .",
    "the final number of stars satisfying the above requirements was 129 .      to recover accurate bolometric fluxes and temperatures for the stars ,",
    "we have obtained accurate and homogeneous johnson - cousins @xmath2 and @xmath6 photometry for all the 186 stars in our initial sample .      for most of the stars in our sample with declination north of @xmath7",
    ", we have made our own photometric observations from april to december 2004 .",
    "observations were done from finland in full remote mode , using the 35-cm telescope piggybacked on the swedish 60-cm telescope located at la palma in the canary islands .",
    "an sbig charge - coupled device was used through all the observations .",
    "johnson - cousins @xmath2 colours were obtained for all stars .",
    "standard stars were selected from landolt ( 1992 ) and among e - regions from cousins ( 1980 ) .",
    "although e - regions provide an extremely accurate set of stars , there are some systematic differences between the landolt and the saao system ( bessell , 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , we have used the landolt ( 1992 ) standards placed onto the saao system by bessell ( 1995 ) .",
    "ten to twenty standard stars were observed each night , bracketing our program stars in colour and airmass . whenever possible program stars were observed when passing the meridian , in order to minimize extrapolation to zero - airmass .",
    "only if the standard deviation between our calibrated and the tabulated values for the standards was smaller than 0.015 mag in each band was the night was considered photometric and observations useful . in addition , only program stars for which the final @xmath8 scatter ( obtained averaging five frames ) was smaller than 0.015 mag were considered usefully accurate .",
    "scatter in the other bands was usually smaller .",
    "we expect our photometry to have accuracies of 0.010 - 0.015 mag on average .",
    "in addition to our observations , we have gathered @xmath2 photometry of equivalent or better precision from the literature : bessell ( 1990a ) ( who also include measurements from cousins ( 1980 ) ) , reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and percival , salaris & kilkenny ( 2003 ) . for stars in common with these authors",
    ", we have found excellent agreement between the photometry , with a scatter of the order of 0.01 mag in all bands , and zero - point shifts between authors of less than 0.01 mag .",
    "this is more than adequately accurate for our study .",
    "infrared @xmath6 photometry for the sample has been taken from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "the uncertainty for each observed 2mass magnitude is denoted in the catalogue by the flags : flags `` j _ '' , `` h _ '' and `` k_msigcom '' , and is the complete error that incorporates the results of processing photometry , internal errors and calibration errors .",
    "some of our stars are very bright and have very high errors in 2mass .",
    "we use 2mass photometry only if the sum of the photometric errors is less than 0.10 mag ( i.e. `` j_''@xmath9``h_''@xmath9 `` k_msigcom''@xmath10 ) .",
    "the final number of stars is thus reduced from 129 to 104 . for our final sample",
    "the errors in @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands are similar , with a mean value of 0.02 mag , whereas a slightly higher mean error is found in @xmath13 band ( 0.03 mag ) .",

    "[ stars ]      we have gathered detailed chemical abundances for our sample stars from the wealth of on - going surveys , dedicated to investigate the chemical composition of our local environment as well as to the host stars of extra - solar planets ( see references in table 1 ) .",
    "the internal accuracy of such data is usually excellent , with uncertainties in the order of 0.10 dex or less .",
    "however , abundance analysis for late - type dwarfs can still be troublesome in some cases ( e.g. allende prieto et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we are aware that , in gathering spectroscopy from different authors , the underlying temperature scale used to derive abundances can differ by as much as 50 - 150  k , which would translate into a [ fe / h ] error of @xmath14 dex ( e.g. asplund 2003 ; kovtyukh et al .",
    "therefore , a more conservative error estimate for our abundances would be @xmath15 dex .",
    "however , as we show in section [ felog ] the infrared flux method , which we employ to recover the fundamental stellar parameters , is only weakly sensitive to the adopted metallicity and uncertainties of @xmath16  dex do not bear heavily on our main results .",
    "the best measured elemental abundance in our dwarf stars is usually iron ( i.e. [ fe / h ] ) whereas for theoretical models the main metallicity parameter is the total heavy - element mass fraction , [ m / h ] . for most of the stars in our sample , the spectra provide measurement not only for [ fe / h ] , but also for the @xmath3-elements , which dominate the global metallicity budget . for stars with @xmath3-element estimates , we compute [ m / h ] ( yi et al . , 2001 ) :",

    "there were 34 such stars in our final sample compared to 70 for which @xmath3 estimates were directly available .",
    "interstellar absorption and reddening must be taken into account for a correct derivation of stellar parameters , but these effects are negligible for our sample stars , as we discuss in this section .",
    "the distance distribution of the sample peaks around @xmath20 pc , the most distant object being located at a distance of @xmath21 pc . for distances closer than @xmath22 pc the polarimetric approach is extremely sensitive and can be used as a lower limit even to the expectedly small amounts of dust ( at least for anisotropic particles ) .",
    "tinbergen ( 1982 ) and leroy ( 1993b ) have confirmed the complete depletion of dust within @xmath23 pc from the sun . using the catalogue of leroy ( 1993a ) we have found polarimetric measurements for 21 stars out of the 129 single and non - variable stars selected in section [ double ] .",
    "the mean percentage polarization is @xmath24 which using the serkowski , mathewson & ford ( 1975 ) conversion factor corresponds to a @xmath25 of 0.0034 mag .",
    "the strmgen h@xmath26 index offers an alternative method for assessing the reddening of individual stars in our sample , especially for the most distant ones ; 59 stars in our _ bona fide _ single and non - variable sample have h@xmath26 measurements ( hauck & mermilliod 1998 ) from which @xmath27 was derived using the intrinsic - colour calibration of schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) plus a small offset correction as noted by nissen ( 1994 ) . the reddening distribution for these 59 stars peaks around @xmath27 = 0.004 , retaining the same mean value ( and never exceeding 0.015 for a single star ) when we restrict the sample to distances further than @xmath22 pc .",

    "once the reddening @xmath25 is known , the extinction at any given wavelength can be determined using the standard extinction law . given that the standard error in the schuster & nissen calibration is on the order of 0.01 in @xmath27 and observational errors in @xmath29 measurements are possible",
    ", the implied reddening corrections are below the noise level .",
    "in addition to this there are indications ( knude 1979 ; vergely et al .",
    "1998 ) that interstellar reddening is primarily caused by small dust clouds causing it to vary in steps of 0.010.03 mag which confirm that the small corrections found are consistent with the assumption of zero reddening for the sample as a whole .",

    "( 2002 ) , though in principle optimized to reproduce colour - temperature relations , provide only a marginal improvement with respect to the latest purely theoretical atlas9 and marcs libraries .",
    "the temperature offset can be translated into a shift in colours needed to set the models onto the empirical scale .",
    "this is done for the atlas9 model in the last row of figure [ modram ] ; in terms of colours , the mismatch corresponds to @xmath14 mag .",
    "empirical calibrations depend on metallicities and colour indices only .",
    "the adopted absolute calibration can not be the main cause of the disagreement since all colours ( in the optical ) scale accordingly . in the optical the adopted vega model that sets the absolute calibration",
    "has been accurately tested by bohlin & gilliland ( 2004 ) ( see appendix a ) .",
    "although we adopt a different absolute calibration in the optical and in the infrared ( see appendix a ) , this could at most affect the colour - metallicity - temperature relations in @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ". even using in the infrared the same absolutely calibrated vega model adopted in the optical does not eliminate the disagreement and offsets of 100  k still persist .",
    "we have also verified that the choice of zero - points plays a negligible role : differences in the optical zero - points based on vega or on the average of vega and sirius ( see appendix a ) lead to mean temperature differences of 10 to 30 k. besides being much smaller than the uncertainty in the colour - temperature relations , such differences go in the direction of worsening the disagreement .    as to the ir zero - points , we checked their effects by generating ir synthetic magnitudes in the tcs and johnson system ( where the vega zero - points are different from those deduced from 2mass photometry ) and compared the model predictions to the alonso et al .",
    "( 1996a ) empirical calibration in these bands ; typical discrepancies of more than 100  k still persist .",
    "the causes for the discrepancy must therefore be model deficiencies and/or inaccuracies in the adopted empirical relations .    in fact we caution that also empirical relations may hide some inadequacies .",
    "for instance , the ramrez & melndez calibration predicts slightly bluer colours for the sun than the recent completely empirical determination of holmberg , flynn & portinari ( 2006 ) .",
    "we can also combine and invert the ramrez & melndez colour - temperature calibrations , to derive the corresponding _ empirical _ colour - colour relations and compare them to the _ observed _ colours for our sample of stars .",
    "interestingly the agreement is not always good : the solar metallicity is slightly offset with respect to the data in @xmath53 band and in the infrared tends to oscillate ( see figure [ empobs ] ) .",
    "this underlines that there is still room for improvement also in the empirical relations .",
    "in this section we have used @xmath0 photometry as the basic observational information to derive bolometric fluxes and effective temperatures of our 104 g and k dwarfs .",
    "our approach follows the infrared flux method ( irfm ) used in the extensive work of alonso , arribas & martnez - roger ( 1995 , 1996b ) .",
    "ours is a new independent implementation of the irfm , applied to our 104 g and k type dwarfs .",
    "our implementation differs from alonso et al ( 1995 , 1996 ) , as we base its absolute calibration on a synthetic spectrum of vega ( as described in detail in appendix a ) rather than on semi - empirical measurements ( alonso , arribas & martnez - roger , 1994 ) .",
    "the use of absolutely calibrated synthetic spectra rather than ground - based measurements traces back to blackwell et al .",

    "this approach has been adopted in the extensive work of cohen and collaborators and also bessell , castelli & plez ( 1998 ) , who concluded that model atmospheres are more reliable than the near - infrared absolute calibration measurements .",
    "models are nowadays sophisticated enough to warrant detailed comparisons between observation and theory and the latest space based measurements confirm the validity of the adopted absolute calibration ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we also differ from the recent work of ramrez & melndez ( 2005b ) in using the most recent model atmospheres and absolute calibration available .",
    "furthermore we use only direct observational data , explicitly avoiding the use of colour calibrations from previous studies to infer the bolometric luminosity .    following alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the flux outside the wavelength range covered by our photometry has been estimated using model atmospheres . since the percentage of @xmath54 measured in the directly observed bands range from @xmath21% to @xmath55% depending on the star ,",
    "the dependence of the estimated bolometric flux on the model is small .    in section [ bolome ] and [ irfmsec ]",
    "we give a detailed description of our implementation of the irfm , mainly following the formulation and terminology adopted by alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996b ) .",
    "our procedure can be summarized as follows .",
    "given the metallicity , the surface gravity ( assuming @xmath31 for all our dwarfs , see section [ libraries ] ) and an initial estimate for the temperature of a star , we have interpolated over the grid of model atmospheres to find the spectrum that best matches these parameters .",

    "i.e. the ` bolometric correction ' .",
    "the bolometric flux is determined from the observations , including the bolometric correction .",

    "this temperature is used for a second interpolation over the grid , and the procedure is iterated until the temperature converges to within 1 k ( typically within 10 iterations ) .",
    "we have tested the results using atlas9 , marcs , basel 2.1 and 3.1 libraries . a detailed discussion on the the dependence on the adopted model is given in section [ onmodel ] .",
    "in the following sections we describe our implementation of the irfm effective temperature scale .      as mentioned above , we use grids of synthetic spectra to bootstrap our irfm .",
    "the grids of synthetic spectra all have a resolution of 250 k in temperature whereas the resolution in metallicity depends on the library , but with typical steps of 0.25 or 0.50 dex .    for any given star of overall metallicity [ m / h ] ( c.f .",
    "( [ overme ] ) , we interpolate over the grid of synthetic spectra in the following way",
    ". first , we use the @xmath58 calibration of alonso et al .",
    "( 1996a ) to obtain an initial estimate of the effective temperature @xmath59 of the star",
    ". then we linearly interpolate in @xmath60 bracketing our temperature estimate @xmath59 at two fixed values of metallicity , which bracket the measured [ m / h ] of the star .",
    "a third linear interpolation is finally done in metallicity in order to obtain the desired synthetic spectrum .",
    "having obtained the spectrum @xmath61 that better matches the physical parameters of the star , for any given band @xmath62 ( running from @xmath63 to @xmath12 ) , we convolve it through the transmission curve @xmath64 of the filter and associate the resulting @xmath65 with its effective wavelength @xmath66 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we then compute the flux covered by the passbands @xmath63 to @xmath12 for the model star ( @xmath67 ) . when the latter is compared with the bolometric flux for the same model star ( @xmath68 )",
    "we can obtain an estimate of the fraction of the flux @xmath69 encompassed by our filters :    @xmath70    we now have the correction factor @xmath71 for the missing flux of a given star , we use its observed @xmath0 magnitudes ( @xmath72 ) to calculate the flux as it arrives on the earth :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the absolute calibrated flux on the earth of the standard star and @xmath75 is its observed magnitude .",
    "the observed magnitudes and the absolute calibration of the standard star are those given in table [ vzpo ] and [ absflux ] respectively and play a key role in determining both bolometric flux and effective temperature as we discuss in section [ abscalsys ] .",
    "the flux at the earth for each band is once again associated with the corresponding effective wavelength of the star , and a simple integration leads to @xmath76 .",
    "the latter is then divided by the @xmath69 factor as defined in eq .",
    "( [ cfact ] ) in order to obtain the bolometric flux measured on the earth @xmath77 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath57 of a star satisfies the stefan - boltzman law @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the bolometric flux on the surface of the star .",
    "only the bolometric flux on the earth is measurable , and we must take into account the angular diameter ( @xmath80 ) of the star .",
    "thus :    @xmath81    the way to break the degeneracy between effective temperature and angular diameter in the previous equation is provided by the infrared flux method ( blackwell & shallis 1977 ; blackwell , shallis & selby 1979 ; blackwell , petford & shallis 1980 ) .",
    "the underlying idea relies on the fact that whereas the bolometric flux depends on both angular diameter and effective temperature ( to the fourth power ) , the monochromatic flux _ in the infrared _ at earth ",
    "@xmath82  depends on the angular diameter but only weakly ( roughly to the first power ) on the effective temperature :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the monochromatic _ surface _ flux of the star .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 defines what is known as the observational @xmath86-factor ( @xmath87 ) , where the dependence on @xmath80 is eliminated . in this sense",
    "the irfm can be regarded as an extreme example of a colour method for determining the temperature . by means of synthetic spectra",
    "it is possible to define a theoretical counterpart ( @xmath88 ) on the _ surface _ of the star , obtained as the quotient between the integrated flux ( @xmath89 ) and the monochromatic flux in the infrared @xmath90 .",
    "the basic equation of the irfm thus reads :    @xmath91    and can be immediately rearranged to give the effective temperature , eliminating the dependence on @xmath80 .",
    "the monochromatic flux @xmath92 is obtained from the infrared photometry using the following relation :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is a correction factor to determine monochromatic flux from broad - band photometry , @xmath95 is the infrared magnitude of the target star , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the magnitude and the absolute monochromatic flux of the standard star in the same infrared band ( see table [ vzpo ] and [ absflux ] ) . for the standard and",
    "the target star @xmath98 refers to their respective effective wavelength in the given infrared band , as we discuss in more detail , together with the definition of the @xmath99factor , in appendix b.    the irfm is often applied using more than one infrared wavelength and different @xmath57 are obtained for each wavelength .",
    "ideally , the derived temperatures should of course be independent of the monochromatic wavelength used . in our case",
    "we have used @xmath100 photometry and the corresponding effective wavelengths .",
    "we have tested the systematic differences in temperatures , luminosities and diameters obtained when _ only one infrared band at a time _ is used for the convergence of the irfm .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ jhk ] .",
    "the @xmath11 band returns temperatures that are systematically cooler than those found from @xmath12 , which translates into greater angular diameters .",
    "the @xmath13 band , returns temperatures that are systematically hotter and therefore smaller angular diameters than in @xmath12 .",
    "these systematic differences do not appear to depend on the temperature range , at least between 45006500  k.    the systematic offsets could be traced back to the absolute calibration in different bands . we further point out that for the sake of this test , the convergence on @xmath57 in the irfm is required in one band only and in figure [ jhk ] the differences are thus exaggerated . the discrepancy can reach a few percent in temperatures and diameters , whereas for bolometric luminosities is usually within 2% though it increases with increasing temperature ( figure [ jhk ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the derived bolometric luminosity is constrained from the full optical and infrared photometry and absolute calibration , whereas for temperature and angular diameter , when relying on one ir band only , the absolute calibration in that band strongly affects the results .",
    "alonso et al . ( 1996b ) concluded that the consistency of the three infrared bands they used ( @xmath101 ) was good over 4000 k , but decided to use only @xmath13 and @xmath102 below 5000 k and only @xmath102 below 4000 k and basically the same is done by ramrez & melndez ( 2005b ) .",
    "we have decided to use the temperature returned in all three bands also below 5000  k , since systematic differences are not too large even below 5000  k , the cooler temperatures in @xmath11 band being compensated by the hotter ones in @xmath13 band .    at each iteration",
    "the temperature used for the convergence is the average of the three ir values weighted with the inverse of their errors `` j _ , '' `` h _ , '' and `` k_msigcom '' .",
    "this temperature is then used to select a new model interpolating over the grid of synthetic spectra as described in section [ bolome ] and a new bolometric flux and temperature are then computed .",
    "the procedure is iterated until the average temperature converges within 1 k. as can be appreciated from figure [ jhk2 ] the systematic differences between the three bands are much reduced .",
    "ideally the ratio of the temperatures determined in the three bands should be unity .",
    "the three mean ratios @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 together with their standard deviations , are 1.0069 ( @xmath106% ) , 0.9943 ( @xmath107% ) and 1.0126 ( @xmath108% ) and this also confirms the quality of the adopted absolute calibration .",
    "the mean standard deviation for the three infrared temperatures is 39  k , reflecting the different band sensitivity to the temperature , the effect of the absolute calibration in different bands as well as the observational errors in the infrared photometry .",
    "band when the convergence is done averaging the three ir values . ]",
    "we have probed the accuracy and the internal consistency of the procedure described in sections [ bolome ] and [ irfmsec ] generating synthetic magnitudes in the range @xmath43 and @xmath109 } \\le 0.5 $ ] and testing how the adopted method recovers the temperatures and luminosities of the underlying synthetic spectra .",
    "the accuracy is excellent given that in all three infrared bands the irfm recovers the right temperature within 1 k and the bolometric luminosity ( i.e.  the theoretical value @xmath89 ) within 0.1% and 0.04% for the atlas and marcs models respectively , i.e.  at the level of the numerical accuracy of direct integration of the bolometric flux from the spectra .",
    "this confirms that the interpolation over the grid introduces no systematics and even a poor initial estimate of the temperature does not affect the method .",
    "we expect the dependence of the results on the adopted synthetic library to be small , since most of the luminosity is actually observed photometrically and the model dependence for the @xmath99-factor and @xmath88 ( see section [ irfmsec ] ) is weak because we are working in a region of the spectrum largely dominated by the continuum .",
    "the method is in fact more sensitive to the adopted absolute calibration that governs @xmath87 .",
    "the principal contributor to continuous opacity in cool stars is due to @xmath110 .",
    "blackwell , lynas - gray & petford ( 1991b ) have shown that by using more accurate opacities with respect to previous work , temperatures increased by 1.3% and angular diameters decreased up to 2.7% , the effect being greatest for cool stars . even though the dependence of the results on the adopted synthetic library is small",
    ", the use of absolute calibrations derived using the most up - to - date model atmospheres ( see appendix a ) is of primary importance . though we use a great deal of observational information , the new _ opacity distribution function _ ( odf ) in the adopted grid of model atmospheres is particularly important . with respect to the more accurate but computationally time consuming _ opacity sampling _ ( os ) , older odf models can underestimate the ir flux by few percent , translating into cooler effective temperatures ( grupp , 2004a ) .",
    "likewise , the better opacities in the uv lead to an increased flux in the visual and infrared region .",
    "this directly affects the ratio between the bolometric and monochromatic flux used for the infrared flux method ( see section [ irfmsec ] ) , so that the latest model atmosphere have to be preferred ( megessier 1994 ; 1998 ) .    for all our 104 g ",
    "k dwarfs we have tested how the recovered parameters change by using atlas9 , marcs , basel 2.1 and 3.1 libraries . the comparison in temperatures , luminosities and angular diameters is shown in figure [ model ] .",
    "the atlas9 and marcs models show a remarkably good agreement through all the temperature range , with differences in the temperature that never exceed a few degrees ( or 0.2% ) and those in the bolometric luminosities and the angular diameters being always within 1% .",
    "though not a proof of the validity of the models , it is very encouraging that the sophisticated physics implemented in independent spectral synthesis codes shows such a high degree of consistency .",
    "the basel models show bigger differences with respect to atlas9 .",
    "the basel 2.1 model tends to give slightly hotter temperatures , higher luminosities and smaller angular diameters when compared to atlas9 , though the systematic is oscillating ( reflecting the underlying continuum adjustments of the semi - empirical basel libraries ) .",
    "we conclude by noting that in the range of temperatures and luminosities studied the dependence of our results on the adopted model never exceeds a few percent and for the latest models ( marcs and atlas9 ) the agreement is well within 1% . hence we will only present and discuss results based on atlas9 in the following .      though the irfm is known to be one of the most accurate ways of determining stellar temperatures without direct angular diameter measurements , its dependence on the observed photometry and metallicities , on the absolute calibration adopted and on the library of synthetic spectra make the evaluation of the errors not straightforward . in this work",
    "we have proceeded from first principles and made use of high accuracy observations only , thus facilitating the estimation of errors and possible biases . since we made use of photometric measurements in many bands ,",
    "we expect the dependence on photometric errors to be rather small , small random errors in different bands being likely to compensate each other .",
    "we have also shown in the previous section that when the latest model atmospheres are adopted , the model dependence is below the one percent level .",
    "the effect of the absolute calibration can be regarded as a systematic bias ; once the absolute calibration in different bands is chosen , all temperatures scale accordingly . as we show in appendix a",
    "the adopted absolute calibration has been thoroughly tested .",
    "the photometric errors in different bands as well as errors in metallicity are likely to compensate each other . in order to check this , for each star",
    "we have run 1000 montecarlo simulations , assigning each time random errors in @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the errors have been assigned with a normal distribution around the observed value and a standard deviation of 0.01 mag in @xmath2 and of `` j _ , '' `` h _ , '' `` k_msigcom '' in @xmath6 .",
    "errors in [ fe / h ] are those given in the papers from which we have collected abundances .",
    "the standard deviation of the resulting temperatures obtained from the montecarlo for each star is typically 11  k and never exceeds 19  k. bolometric luminosities have a mean relative error of only 0.5% and never exceeding 0.8% ; for angular diameters the mean error sets to 0.4% and never exceeds 0.5% .",
    "the interpolation within the grid of synthetic spectra is as a function of [ m / h ] .",
    "we have checked the effect of @xmath3elements by making the interpolation as a function of [ fe / h ] instead , finding very little differences in the derived fundamental parameters around the solar values . at lower metallicities",
    "the effect of the @xmath3elements start to be important as expected ( figure [ feme ] ) .",
    "the effect is in any case , always within 20  k in @xmath57 and within 2% in bolometric luminosity and @xmath80 .     or [ fe / h ]",
    "are used . ]",
    "spectroscopic metallicities have typical errors well within 0.10 dex .",
    "as we show in figure [ merr ] a change of few dex in metallicity has almost no effect on the resulting temperatures around the solar values , but at lower metallicities systematic errors of 0.100.20 dex in [ fe / h ] can introduce biases up to 40  k. this is an important point when using large surveys with photometric metallicities that have typical errors above 0.10 dex .        the dependence on the adopted surface gravity",
    "is very mild for dwarf stars .",
    "we have verified that a change of @xmath34 dex in @xmath32 implies differences that never exceed @xmath20 k in temperature and well within 1% for bolometric fluxes and angular diameters .",
    "the errors in the adopted magnitudes and absolute calibrations of vega in different bands can be regarded as a systematic bias , since once they are selected , the recovered temperatures , luminosities and angular diameters scale accordingly .",
    "errors in the observed @xmath2 magnitudes of vega are around 0.01 mag whereas the uncertainties in @xmath111 magnitudes given by cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are within a few millimag . as for the random errors on the photometric zero - points ,",
    "it is very likely that uncertainties in vega s magnitudes compensate each other .    on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainties in the adopted absolute calibration mainly come from the uncertainty in the flux of vega at 5556 @xmath112 .",
    "since the absolute calibration in all bands scales accordingly ( even though we have used slightly different approaches in optical and infrared , see appendix a ) , we evaluate the systematic error in temperatures for the worst case scenario , i.e. when all errors correlate to give systematically higher or lower fluxes .",
    "the uncertainties adopted are those given in table [ absflux ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ updown ] .",
    "correlate . translated into magnitudes it corresponds to a mean shift of vega s zero - points of @xmath113 mag in the optical and @xmath114 mag in the infrared . ]    finally , a detailed comparison with data from satellites validate within the errors the adopted calibration , though it seems to suggest that infrared fluxes should be brightened by 1% at most ( see appendix a ) .",
    "if so , the resulting temperatures would cool down by 10 to 30  k and luminosities and angular diameters would increase on average by 0.2% and 0.7% , respectively .",
    "the primary estimate for errors in @xmath57 is from the scatter in the temperature deduced from @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath115 bands that reflects photometric errors as well as differences in the corresponding absolute calibration ( see section [ irfmsec ] ) . as regards the uncertainties discussed in sections [ felog ] and [ mc ] , they are of the same order and we quadratically sum them to the standard deviation in the resulting @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath115 for a fair estimate of the global errors on temperatures .",
    "the uncertainties of the bolometric luminosities mostly depend on the photometry that accounts for @xmath116  7085% of the resulting luminosity .",
    "the errors from the observations have been estimated by summing in quadrature those from the montecarlo simulation ( section [ mc ] ) to those due to a change of @xmath34  dex in @xmath32 .",
    "finally , for the resulting angular diameters we propagate the errors in temperature and luminosity from equation [ bolflux ] .",
    "the mean internal accuracy of the resulting temperatures is of 0.8% , that of the luminosities of 0.5% and that of the angular diameters of 1.7% .",
    "there are possible systematic errors coming from the adopted absolute calibration .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ updown ] such uncertainties give an additional mean error of 0.3% in temperature and 1.2% in luminosity that translate into an additional systematic error of 0.7% in angular diameters .",
    "a summary of the uncertainties is given in table [ unc ] .",
    ".mean accuracy of the derived fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "notice that either the systematics given here , either those shown in figure [ updown ] are determined according table [ absflux ] and do not account for possible ( and only indicative ) shifts in vega s zero - points as a consequence of its rapidly rotating nature ( see appendix a ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the effective wavelengths associated to each filter are computed in accordance with appendix b. the error in @xmath117 bands are computed assuming an arbitrary uncertainty of 1% to the absolute flux .",
    "lacking the actual uncertainties in the measurement of the filters transmission curve , the adopted uncertainty is consistent with a wavelength ",
    "independent filter uncertainty in addition to the 0.7% absolute uncertainty at 5556  from megessier ( 1995 ) .",
    "recent work by gulliver et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) and aufdenberg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) indicate that vega is pole - on and fast rotator . thus standard model atmospheres are not appropriate for vega , as discussed by bohlin & gilliland ( 2004 ) . nonetheless _",
    "stis _ in the optical and _ msx _ in the infrared have confirmed the adopted absolute calibrations to be accurate at the percent level .",
    "it is interesting to note that peterson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) give an estimate of the shift in vega s zero - points as a consequence of the higher infrared flux due to its rapidly rotating nature .",
    "though only indicative , as the authors say , the shifts for their latest non - rotating synthetic spectrum in the infrared amount to @xmath118 mag .",
    "the net effect of such shifts would be to reduce the temperatures recovered via irfm .",
    "considering that in the infrared we are adopting the absolute calibration given by cohen ( already some @xmath119 brighter as compared to the latest kurucz model ) this reduces the size of the required shifts to about @xmath120 mag . the agreement within 1% with _ msx",
    "_ would however require a shift of only @xmath121 mag . since the proposed shifts are only indicative and the measurements confirm the adopted calibration within the errors , we adopt the pragmatic choice of using the model that at any given range better agrees with the data .",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that there is no consistent published atmospheric model for vega at both visible and infrared wavelengths and this justifies our adoption of the kurucz ( 2003 ) or cohen models at different wavelengths .",
    "likewise , the use of composite model atmospheres for vega is also advocated from peterson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . for synthetic photometry",
    "the use of composite spectra is often avoided on the reason that fixing the zero - points , possible physical deficiencies in the synthetic spectrum of vega are likely to be present in the synthetic library and therefore they would cancel out ( e.g. girardi et al . 2002 ) . in our case",
    "the situation is not so clear , since synthetic spectra give now excellent comparison with the real ones and the deficiencies for vega are likely to be due to the particular nature of this star .",
    "sirius is often used as an additional fundamental colour standard ( e.g. bessell , castelli & plez 1998 ) , allowing one to control the possible problems of putative variability and an ir excess for vega .",
    "first seen by aumann ( 1984 ) beyond 12 @xmath122 , vega s variability at shorter wavelengths has long been a matter of discussion ( see e.g. bessell , castelli & plez 1998 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2001 ) , though the rapidly rotating model could actually resolve the controversy ( peterson at al .",
    "the most recent data from _ msx _ ( price et al . 2004 ) and _ spitzer _ ( su et al . 2005 ) support models where vega s infrared excess and variability is due to a cold dust disk . the ir excess increase steadily longward of @xmath123 whereas at @xmath124 the differences between model atmosphere and measurements are entirely consistent within the uncertainties and therefore should not affect the optical and near - infrared region ( 0.36  2.4 @xmath122 ) we are working with . for the sake of completeness we have tested the differences in the derived @xmath2 zero - points when including sirius in the calibration . adopting the latest kurucz model available for it and the colours from bessell ( 1990a ) , the differences in the derived zero - points between the use of vega only or vega plus sirius range from 0.008 mag in @xmath8 to 0.002 mag in @xmath125 .",
    "such differences are below the uncertainties in magnitude and colours . in addition , since absolute calibration and magnitudes for sirius in the 2mass system are not available , we have decided to adopt only vega as our standard star .",
    "this also makes clearer the comparison between synthetic colours and the irfm that strongly depends on the vega absolute calibration .",
    "the transmission curves used come from bessell ( 1990b ) for the johnson - cousins @xmath117 system and from cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the 2mass @xmath6 system .",
    "the 2mass transmission curves carefully incorporate the effect of the optical system , the detector quantum efficiency and the site - specific atmospheric transmissions .",
    "the effect of the telescope optics on the estimated @xmath117 passband are not counted , but in the @xmath126 band this has been proved to cause uncertainty below few millimag ( colina & bohlin , 1994 ) , and thus smaller than any possible observational error we are going to compare with .",
    "we note that all our photometry is reduced to zero airmass and when we refer to measurements on the earth , we always mean at the top of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "in the present work we have reduced broadband ( heterochromatic ) measurement in a band @xmath62 to a monochromatic flux ( @xmath127 ) by means of the following relation :      where the integration is done in the interval @xmath129 that comprise a given passband @xmath64 .",
    "we remark that the above formulation is suited for both energy integration in the optical and photo - counting in the ir , provided that we are dealing with the bessell ( 1990b ) and cohen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) transmission curves ( see appendix a ) .    assuming that the function @xmath61 is continuous and that @xmath64 does not change sign in the interval @xmath129 , the generalization of the mean value theorem states that there is at least one value of @xmath130 in the interval @xmath129 such that            stellar spectra do not necessarily satisfy the requirements of the mean value theorem for integration , as they exhibit discontinuities .",
    "although the mean value of the intrinsic flux is well - defined ( and we have extensively used it ) , the determination of the isophotal wavelength becomes problematic because spectra contain absorption lines and hence the definition can yield multiple solutions .",
    "this is the mean wavelength of the passband as weighted by the energy distribution of the source over the band .",
    "the effective wavelength is thus an approximation for @xmath133 , however since the monochromatic magnitude at the effective wavelength is almost identical to that at the isophotal wavelength ( golay 1974 ) , we have used the effective wavelength through all our work .",
    "when dealing with photometric data , a way to obtain monochromatic flux from heterochromatic measurements is provided by the @xmath99 factor .",
    "ideally the @xmath99-factor ( eq . [ qmono ] ) should be determined from spectroscopic data but in practice we rely on a grid of models . since the absolute monochromatic flux for a given band is determined as described in appendix a",
