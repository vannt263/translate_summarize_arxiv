    "taken together , these suggest that the way superconductivity is destroyed as @xmath12 is very unusual . unfortunately , there has been a paucity of data on such very underdoped cuprates , in part due to sample preparation difficulties . in addition ,",

    "briefly , their method utilizes the fact that the _ effective _ doping on the cuo@xmath5 planes is governed by both the oxygen concentration and the degree of oxygen ordering in the cuo chains . by varying the latter variable ( via room temperature annealing ) , these authors can alter the effective doping ( and thus @xmath9 ) to explore the doping dependence of physical quantities ( such as the @xmath3-axis penetration depth  @xcite ) in the strongly underdoped regime @xmath13 .    motivated by the recent c - axis penetration results of hosseini _ et al._,@xcite in this paper",
    "we develop a model aimed at capturing the overall phenomenology of the doping and temperature dependence of the @xmath2-plane and @xmath3-axis penetration depths ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ) .",
    "our model combines incoherent tunneling in the @xmath3-direction with a phenomenological momentum - dependent charge renormalization factor inspired by the idea of ioffe and millis  @xcite to account for anomalous doping dependences . on a more fundamental level we are interested in understanding the constraints that this data imposes on the models of strongly correlated electron matter describing the @xmath4-wave superconductor on the verge of becoming a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "our results indicate that the appropriate effective theory must exhibit a `` nodal protectorate '' consisting of regions in the vicinity of the @xmath4-wave gap nodes where the quasiparticles remain well defined even as @xmath13 .",
    "to begin , let us review the overall phenomenology of the penetration depth in the cuprates .",
    "for the moment , we are interested in general trends ( especially in the strongly underdoped regime @xmath12 ) in the penetration depth . to the extent that such data is available , @xcite the @xmath2-plane penetration depth @xmath16 exhibits the following behavior : @xmath17 where we have expressed @xmath16 in terms of the associated superfluid stiffness @xmath18 measuring the free energy cost to a variation of the order - parameter phase in the @xmath2 plane . here",

    "for ybco the relevant parameters are @xmath19mev and @xmath20.@xcite we shall assume that this phenomenology holds for all underdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath1 in eq .  ( [ eq : slopeab ] ) is _ nearly _ doping independent , in the sense that although it varies as the gap amplitude @xmath21 varies , it does not vary as strongly as @xmath22 i.e. , linear in @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1-linear term is well known and is understood to be due to the excitation of quasiparticles out of the condensate near the nodes of the @xmath4-wave order parameter.@xcite the fact that this relation holds to very low dopings ( along with other experiments sensitive to nodal physics , see , e.g. , ref .  [ ] ) indicates that near the nodes elementary excitations in cuprates are well described by conventional bcs quasiparticles even for @xmath13 .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath18 , on the other hand , represents one of the central mysteries in the cuprates.@xcite the linear in @xmath0 reduction of @xmath22 as one approaches half filling must be attributed to the proximity of the mott - hubbard insulating phase .",
    "however , most theoretical treatments ( such as the rvb - type@xcite and gutzwiller projection@xcite approaches ) that can account for the observed @xmath0-dependence of @xmath22 also predict a strongly @xmath0-dependent prefactor @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : slopeab ] ) , in disagreement with the data .",
    "thus , the central theoretical problem appears to lie in constructing a model that would make only a small fraction @xmath24 of all electrons participate in the superconducting condensate while at the same time preserve the simple bcs character of the nodal quasiparticles . in the following",
    "we resolve this problem by postulating that , at least for the purposes of studying the superfluid stiffness , the underdoped cuprates can be described by the bcs theory augmented with a phenomenological constraint that only cooper pairs composed of electrons with momenta in the vicinity of the nodal points effectively couple to the external electromagnetic field .",
    "we implement this idea by extending the `` effective charge renormalization '' concept introduced in this context by ioffe and millis.@xcite    this model , described in a more detail below , is _ designed _ to reproduce the @xmath2-plane phenomenology embodied in eq .",
    "( [ eq : slopeab ] ) .",
    "what makes us believe that it might be of more general validity is the fact that it also reproduces the doping dependence of the @xmath3-axis superfluid stiffness , @xmath25 , once we adopt a model for interlayer coupling that gives the correct ( nonlinear ) temperature dependence of this quantity .",
    "the phenomenology along the @xmath3-axis is tantalizingly similar to the @xmath2 plane case and can be written in the following way : @xcite @xmath26 where the exponent @xmath27 is , within the experimental accuracy , the same for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 and close to @xmath28 , while @xmath29 are again @xmath0 and @xmath1 independent constants .",
    "the fact that the temperature dependence is nearly quadratic ( as opposed to linear ) points to the _ incoherent _ coupling between the copper - oxygen planes , as discussed by previous authors.@xcite in the following we shall clarify the specific conditions under which such a nearly quadratic @xmath1-dependence arises for the incoherent tunneling model .",

    "( [ eq : slopeab ] ) . to rectify this discrepancy the form of @xmath50 must be modified .",
    "since at low temperatures the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath52 comes from thermally excited quasiparticles near the four nodal points of a @xmath4-wave gap , it is clear that in order to preserve this correct temperature dependence @xmath50 must remain _ close to unity _ in the nodal regions . to suppress the overall magnitude of @xmath53",

    "we compute the @xmath3-axis superfluid stiffness within a tunneling model and will find similar behavior .",

    "in particular any such theory must explain what protects the low - energy nodal excitations from the strong interactions that otherwise drive the electrons in the remainder of the brillouin zone inert to applied electromagnetic fields .",

    "it is more difficult to address the finite-@xmath1 properties within these models and the behavior of @xmath52 is not known at present .",
    "however , these being real space techniques , it is not easy to envision a mechanism that would protect the nodal regions from the strong correlations imposed by the projection and one would naively expect that the result will suffer from the same problem as the rvb theories .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependence of @xmath210 can be explained within the fermi liquid theory for superconductors with anisotropic fermi surface@xcite assuming a particular form of the interaction @xmath211 .",
    "we have checked that a most straightforward extension of this interaction does not reproduce the @xmath3-axis phenomenology ; one would have to impose another set of constraints for the interlayer interactions to get the observed behavior which makes this route somewhat implausible in our view .",
    "one could imagine a competing order@xcite in the particle - hole channel gapping out the fermi surface away from the nodes , thus reducing the number of electrons participating in the superfluid in a manner consistent with the observed phenomenology.@xcite the advantage of this scenario is that nodal quasiparticles would automatically remain protected and the @xmath3-axis phenomenology would presumably also follow . on the other hand such competing orders necessarily break various space - time symmetries of the underlying system and such symmetry breaking",
    "should be easily observable if the competing order was strong enough to modify the superfluid response in accord with experiment . on balance",
    "we feel that the available evidence does not support this scenario.@xcite    in the phase fluctuation scenarios @xcite the low superfluid density @xmath212 enters as a phenomenological input .",
    "an appealing feature of these models is that in the superconducting state the phase fluctuations are gapped ( with the gap of the order of @xmath213 ) and thus do not affect the low energy nodal quasiparticles which remain sharp even as @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand the phase fluctuation models require some microscopic theory to describe the mott physics that is ultimately responsible for the assumed low superfluid density .",
    "it would thus appear that none of the microscopic theories that exist at the present time satisfies all of the constraints implied by the phenomenological model advocated in this paper .",

    "<S> we formulate a model describing the doping ( @xmath0 ) and temperature ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the @xmath2-plane and @xmath3-axis penetration depth of a cuprate superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the model incorporates the suppression of the superfluid density with underdoping as the system approaches the mott - hubbard insulating state by augmenting a @xmath4-wave bcs model with a phenomenological charge renormalization factor that is vanishingly small for states away from the nodes of the @xmath4-wave pair potential but close to unity in the vicinity of the nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-axis penetration depth is captured within a model of incoherent electron tunneling between the cuo@xmath5 planes . </S>",
    "<S> application of this model to the recent experimental data on the high - purity single crystals of yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 implies existence of a `` nodal protectorate '' , a @xmath8-space region in the vicinity of the nodes whose size decreases in proportion to @xmath0 , in which @xmath4-wave quasiparticles remain sharp even as the system teeters on the brink of becoming an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the superfluid density , which is extremely small for these samples , also appears to come exclusively from these protected nodal regions . </S>"
