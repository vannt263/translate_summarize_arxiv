    "the swarming states predicted by active matter theories are disrupted by hydrodynamics , resulting in a more turbulent suspension behavior . under circular confinement , although direct cell interactions lead to local cell alignment , large scale order appears only when the swimmer motion is coupled to the fluid dynamics .",
    "simulation results not only agree qualitatively with the experiments , they also highlight the microscopic bacterial organization . in particular , the cells in the bulk are shown to swim against the collectively - generated fluid flow , a result that was not foreseen in previous publications .",
    "we confirmed that prediction by experimentally recording both motion and swimming directions , which to our knowledge has never been done in dense bacterial suspensions .",
    "to do so we tagged and tracked the relative positions of the cells body and flagella .",

    "ultimately , a closer comparison to experiments requires 3d particle simulations , more accurate descriptions of the fluid flows generated by the swimmers in the bulk and near boundaries , and possibly an accounting of the the swimmers geometry and flagella .",
    "this model could be adapted to a 3d domain , changing the packing of the cells but also the fluid flow they generate : in 2d domains a swimmer dipolar flow decays with distance from the cell as @xmath73 instead of the @xmath74 decay in 3d which is more appropriate for the experimental situation .",
    "the present model does not account for close - range and lubrication hydrodynamics or brownian noise effects .",
    "recent simulations of spherical squirmers at high packing fractions @xcite show that including close - range hydrodynamics significantly affects the suspension behavior .",
    "although simplified , the model described here has been shown to give good insights into the dynamics of micro - swimmer suspensions and could be applied to more complex geometries to study microscopic interactions and ordering that are difficult to visualize experimentally .",
