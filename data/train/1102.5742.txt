    "majorana fermions ( which are responsible for the non - abelian content of ising anyons @xcite ) have been proposed to exist in a number of condensed matter settings .",
    "one particularly intriguing development involves the majorana states trapped within the hedgehog defects that emerge at the interface between a topological insulator and the mouths of vortices in a type ii superconductor @xcite . since the realization of anyon statistics",
    "is generally believed to be impossible beyond two dimensions , the novelty of this setup is its three dimensional ( 3d ) nature .",
    "the paradox resolves upon realizing that the anyons at hedgehogs are not merely point - like objects , but singularities of a @xmath2 order parameter which may be modeled by ribbons joining hedgehogs @xcite .",
    "the ribbons contain additional twist degrees of freedom relevant to particle exchange : twisting a ribbon transforms the state .",
    "the anyons in the teo - kane model provide a projective representation of the ribbon permutation group @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this remnant of braiding in higher dimensions seems to be special to ising anyons : fibonacci anyons , for example , seem to have no 3d version .",
    "while these mathematical details are interesting , they are subordinate to the question relevant to physicists : do 3d anyons really exist or are they merely theoretical constructs ? to the best of our knowledge , this paper provides the first proposal to settle this question in the lab rather than via theoretical arguments .",
    "majorana fermions have proven challenging to unambiguously detect in any dimension not to mention the exotic 3d context we have in mind here .",
    "for example , within the setting of quantum hall systems , relevant to 2d non - abelian anyons , experiments usually involve edge state transport @xcite .",
    "recently , however , several _ bulk _ probes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "in particular , one suggestion exploits the huge ground state degeneracy inherent to the non - abelian anyon system to produce a cooling effect @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in analogy to adiabatic cooling via spin demagnetization , but here the entropy reservoir is an anyon system rather than a spin system .",
    "crucially , the non - abelian entropy is temperature independent but proportional to the number of non - abelian anyons , which , in turn , can be adiabatically ( or , more precisely , isentropically ) controlled by a magnetic field .",
    "thus , an adiabatic increase in the non - abelian entropy necessarily implies a decrease in the rest of the system s entropy .",
    "this is accomplished by a lowering of the system s temperature .",
    "while this idea has been explored in a 2d setting @xcite , we expect it to work even better in 3d where the topological and conventional sources of entropy ( which are fundamentally 3d ) will be on an equal footing .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of detecting 3d anyons via cooling by applying the teo - kane model to a specific heterostructure involving a topological insulator and a superconductor .",
    "since we are mainly interested in demonstrating feasibility , our principal goal will be to establish an experimentally accessible temperature window @xmath3 in which the cooling effect is significant .",
    "we make quantitative estimates using realistic material parameters .",
    "the upper bound of the temperature window , @xmath4 , is determined by the temperature where sources of entropy other than anyons begin to dominate the system .",
    "the lower bound of the temperature window , @xmath5 , is established by calculating the ground state energy degeneracy splitting that results from majorana - majorana tunneling .",
    "operating at temperatures above this splitting energy allows us to treat the low energy hilbert space as essentially degenerate .",
    "in section [ sec : majoranadetection1d2d ] we briefly mention existing proposals to detect the more conventional type of non - abelian ising anyons below three dimensions .",
    "section [ sec : devstruc ] describes the physical structure and material components of the device for our 3d anyon system .",
    "the model we use to analyze this device is explained in section [ sec : model ] , from which we construct majorana solutions in section [ sec : majoranasols ] and calculate the ground state degeneracy splitting as a function of majorana separation in section [ sec : degen ]",
    ". section [ sec : entropy ] describes the calculation of all contributions to the system entropy .",
    "we use this in section [ sec : cooling ] to determine the feasibility of detection by cooling and establish the parameter regime in which to carry out the search for 3d non - abelian anyons .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "there are now many proposals for condensed matter realizations of majoranas in two dimensional systems . among them ,",
    "the most actively studied thus far is the quantum hall state at filling factor @xmath7 where detection schemes have been proposed using both edge @xcite and bulk @xcite probes .",
    "some tantalizing evidence has been reported based on the former @xcite .",
    "other systems in which majoranas may exist and detection strategies have been theoretically proposed include strontium ruthenates @xcite , helium-3 @xcite , topological insulator based heterostructures @xcite , semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , cold atoms systems @xcite , and quantum wire networks @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the existence of these 2d majoranas has lagged somewhat the large number of theoretical propositions .    nonetheless , all these majorana fermions are of the two dimensional su(2)@xmath0 ising anyon variety @xcite .",
    "they are representations of the braid group .",
    "the possibility for anyons beyond two dimensions came as a bit of a shock @xcite due to certain long - standing trusted mathematical arguments .",
    "it turns out that no mathematical theorems need to be corrected because these 3d anyons do not provide representations of the braid group but rather provide projective representations of the ribbon permutation group @xcite .",
    "we also mention in passing that the quantum wire networks involve 1d majorana fermions in a sense , but their braiding ( for example using t - junctions as proposed by alicea et al @xcite ) still requires the spanning of 2d real space by the network .",
    "furthermore , these 1d majoranas are still linked to the 2d anyon statistics tied up with the braid group rather than the 3d projective ribbon permutation statistics of 3d anyons .",
    "consider an s - wave , type ii superconductor sandwiched between layers of a 3d topological insulator .",
    "the superconductor occupies the region @xmath8 with flanking layers of topological insulator for @xmath9 .",
    "this structure is repeated along the @xmath10-direction to build a superlattice and thus a true bulk 3d system .",
    "see figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "due to this periodicity , our calculations will only need to consider a single superlayer .",
    "for the topological insulator , we choose bi@xmath0se@xmath1 appropriately p - doped so that the fermi level ( @xmath11 ) is pushed down into the bulk gap . for the superconductor ,",
    "we choose the n - doped material cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 which is known to be a strongly type ii ( @xmath13 ) bulk superconductor @xcite .",
    "the precise nature of the superconductivity in this material is not yet known , but a theoretical proposal has suggested that it may be unconventional @xcite . in the absence of further experimental data , we will assume it to be s - wave ; this and other caveats are discussed further at the end of the paper .",
    "existing experimental results on cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( almost ) supply the required minimal input needed for our calculation .",
    "arpes provides numbers for the fermi energy , velocity , wavevector , and the spin - orbit gap @xcite : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we also need the superconducting gap ( @xmath18 ) and coherence length ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "based on the existing experimental data , there are two ways of determining @xmath18 and @xmath19 . both quantities could be inferred from the known superconducting transition temperature , @xmath20 k @xcite , using the bcs relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 . on the other hand , we could use the measurement of the upper critical field , @xmath23 tesla @xcite , to give a more direct estimate of the coherence length @xmath24  independent of bcs theory .",
    "this could then be combined with the bcs relation @xmath25 to give a value for the superconducting gap .",
    "the fact that these two methods do not agree @xcite provides a puzzle for the community . what is needed is a _",
    "direct _ measurement of @xmath18 , which has not been reported yet . since this paper",
    "is chiefly concerned with vortices we will trust the @xmath26-derived value of @xmath19 , which is @xmath27  . to be consistent , this value of @xmath19",
    "is then used to set @xmath28 mev .    very recently",
    ", another indirect estimate of the gap has been made using specific heat data @xcite .",
    "weak - coupling bcs theory does not fit the data , while a fit to strong - coupling bcs theory produces parameter values inconsistent with other measures .",
    "therefore , the main conclusions to be drawn from this experiment are the bulk nature of the superconductivity , the lack of nodes in the gap , and the fact that the gap is larger than would be expected from bcs theory using @xmath29 . we therefore continue to use @xmath26 to estimate the value of the superconducting gap .",
    "the low - energy theory is an eight - band dirac model @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 with diagonal terms given by @xmath32 .",
    "we use the standard dirac - pauli representation : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the fermion is an eight - component object deriving from spin , orbital , and particle - hole degrees of freedom : @xmath36 , where each @xmath37 and @xmath38 has two components .",
    "particle - hole symmetry enforces @xmath39 .",
    "we have written the model in the same way as ref .  , which is unitarily equivalent to the models used in refs .   and .",
    "variants of this model have been studied for many years @xcite .",
    "we use a dirac bogoliubov - de - gennes ( bdg ) model for this material .",
    "the construction of the effective model for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has been discussed by several groups , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "while higher momentum terms can sometimes lead to interesting physics , the situation we are considering only requires use of a dirac model .",
    "we combine the superconducting and spin - orbit gaps into a single 3-component order parameter @xcite : @xmath40 . within the superconductor ,",
    "a vortex excitation along the @xmath41-axis is achieved by imposing the following profile on the superconducting order parameter : @xmath42 the interface between the topological insulator and superconductor is specified by imposing the following kink profile on the spin - orbit gap : @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . in this way",
    "the band is inverted within the topological insulator , while taking the opposite sign in the ( topologically trivial ) superconductor .",
    "note that we have considered a topological insulator and trivial superconductor , but the kink would also exist at the interface of a trivial insulator and a topological superconductor .",
    "the combination of a vortex in @xmath18 and a @xmath47 kink in @xmath48 leads to an anisotropic hedgehog in @xmath49 occurring where the vortex tube meets the interface with the topological insulator .",
    "we can think of this defect as a potential well and solve for the zero energy solutions of the bdg equation @xmath50 . at the kink ( @xmath51 ) this leads to the following majorana zero - mode wavefunctions @xcite @xmath52 while at the upper interface ( @xmath53 ) we have an anti - kink given by cyclically permuting the right hand side two steps .",
    "the expressions for @xmath38 follow from particle - hole symmetry and @xmath54 is a normalization constant given by @xmath55}$ ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds .",
    "these expressions are valid inside the superconductor .",
    "we ignore the exponential tail decaying into the topological insulator which is miniscule due to the large insulating gap .",
    "an exact treatment of this problem would numerically solve for the order parameter profiles self - consistently .",
    "see , for example , ref .  .",
    "however , since we desire analytical expressions we make the following standard simplification : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60  .",
    "thus , two experimentally determined parameters influence the localization of the majorana wavefunction : @xmath19 and @xmath48 ( or , equivalently , @xmath61 as defined above ) .",
    "@xmath62 determines the localization in the @xmath41-direction while @xmath19 sets the decay length in the @xmath63-plane . since @xmath64",
    ", we might already speculate that the in - plane coupling between majoranas will be much more important than the coupling in the @xmath41-direction for the degeneracy splitting .",
    "we turn to this issue next .",
    "with the majorana wavefunctions in hand , we can use these expressions to calculate the splitting of the ground state degeneracy as a function of majorana separation .",
    "this energy splitting has been calculated by a variety of means in 2d majorana systems .",
    "we will generalize to 3d the method of ref .   who adapted to 2d the 1d lifshitz problem @xcite .",
    "our calculation is very similar to what has already been presented in refs .   and .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for technical details . in",
    "what follows , we outline the main idea behind the calculation .",
    "consider two majorana states , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which are brought together from infinity .",
    "as they approach each other , the degenerate eigenvalue of the two fusion channels is split by an amount @xmath67 .",
    "the new eigenfunctions of this two - majorana state are @xmath68 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath69 .",
    "particle - hole symmetry dictates @xmath70 .",
    "we calculate the eigenvalue of one of these states as follows @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an integration region corresponding to the half - infinite volume in three dimensions .",
    "the integrand can be written in terms of total derivatives , and the localized nature of the wavefunctions allows us to reduce @xmath72 to the infinite 2d plane that bisects the line joining the two majorana states in question .",
    "we consider two cases : vertical majorana - majorana coupling in the @xmath41-direction and lateral majorana - majorana coupling in the @xmath63-plane .",
    "for the vertical coupling , we place @xmath65 at @xmath73 and @xmath66 at @xmath74 ; @xmath75 is the superconductor thickness .",
    "importantly , one of these is a `` kink hedgehog '' while the other is an `` anti - kink hedgehog .",
    "'' equations ( [ eq : majoranakink ] ) and ( [ eq : esplit ] ) lead to : @xmath76 where the prefactor is @xmath77 }              { \\left [ k(-\\epsilon_f^2 /\\delta^2 ) - e(-\\epsilon_f^2 /\\delta^2 ) \\right ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath78 is seemingly a large energy scale , the sech@xmath79 factor stemming from the in - plane localization makes the degeneracy splitting due to coupling in the @xmath41-direction completely negligible compared to what we calculate next .    for the lateral coupling within the same interface ,",
    "we consider two majoranas @xmath65 at @xmath80 and @xmath66 at @xmath81 ; @xmath82 is the in - plane distance between hedgehogs . unlike the case of vertical coupling , the two wavefunctions here are both kinks .",

    "@xmath86 is much larger than @xmath87 , so we neglect the latter .",
    "the attenuation and period of oscillation of @xmath86 depends on the separation between majoranas , @xmath82 , which is in turn determined by the lattice spacing of the abrikosov vortex lattice . for a triangular lattice ,",
    "this spacing is related to the field by @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the envelope of the energy splitting varies with field as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 tesla .",
    "this sets the lower bound of the temperature window and is clearly field - dependent : @xmath91 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : tempwindow]a .",
    "we next determine the upper bound of the temperature window .",
    "to compute the cooling effect we need to understand all appreciable contributions to the total entropy as a function of temperature and field : @xmath92",
    ". these can be classified into phonon ( @xmath93 ) and vortex ( @xmath94 ) contributions with the latter being composed of several pieces ( electronic contributions at the temperatures of interest are negligible because @xmath95 ) .",
    "thus , the total entropy is given by @xmath96 the phonon entropy is standard : @xmath97 where @xmath98 k is the debye temperature of the parent compound @xcite and @xmath99 is the volume of the unit cell @xcite .",
    "within the superconductor material cu@xmath100bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , recent specific heat data @xcite has yielded a debye temperature of @xmath101 k.    the vortex entropy will have several contributions .",
    "the most important piece of @xmath94 is due to the non - abelian anyons ( @xmath102 ) ; this is what drives the dramatic low - temperature cooling effect . for a large number of vortices ( @xmath103 )",
    "this is simply @xcite @xmath104 the non - abelian anyon entropy only depends on @xmath105 , not @xmath106 , and this is through its dependence on the number of vortices : @xmath107 with @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the flux quantum and @xmath110 is the sample area perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this linear approximation is justified for @xmath111 .",
    "the contribution to the vortex entropy from more conventional sources will depend on the vortex density , and thus the magnetic field .",
    "an isolated vortex line will contribute two types of entropy .",
    "first , there are subgap bound states that are localized to the core but extended along the @xmath41-direction .",
    "these are usually called cdgm excitations after caroli , de gennes , and matricon @xcite .",
    "second , a single vortex line will have excitations analogous to those of a fluctuating string @xcite . for our materials and parameter regimes ,",
    "this second type of fluctuation turns out to contribute negligibly to the total entropy .",
    "in addition to this single - vortex physics , collective effects can manifest when the magnetic field is increased even slightly above @xmath112 leading to the formation of an abrikosov vortex lattice .",
    "a dense array of vortices can have collective modes of the same two types as described above .",
    "first , there are collective cdgm excitations @xcite , and second there are modes corresponding to fluctuating elastic media @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the term `` dense '' must be understood with respect to the appropriate length scale .",
    "define @xmath82 as the lateral vortex - vortex distance , @xmath113 as the penetration depth , and @xmath19 as the superconducting coherence length .",
    "collective modes of the vortex lattice appear when the magnetic field is such that @xmath114 .",
    "in contrast , collective cdgm excitations only appear at the much higher density @xmath115 . for our device , @xmath116 mt and @xmath23 t , giving a rather large range @xmath117 ( or , equivalently , @xmath118 ) in the dilute limit with respect to cdgm excitations , but the dense collective - mode limit of vortex fluctuations .",
    "in such a regime , the cdgm entropy is given by @xmath119 times the `` isolated '' vortex line contribution , @xmath120 while the vortex lattice entropy takes the form @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the cdgm mini - gap , @xmath123 is the quantum of circulation , @xmath124 is the riemann - zeta function , and @xmath125 is the superconductor sample volume .",
    "this form of @xmath126 , which is proportional to @xmath127 , is only valid in the parameter regimes of interest to us .",
    "eventually , at very low fields on the order of @xmath112 , @xmath126 must of course vanish as @xmath105 decreases @xcite .",
    "thus , the total vortex entropy is given by @xmath128 when added to the phonon entropy , this yields an approximate analytic expression for the total system entropy as a function of @xmath106 and @xmath105 .",
    "using these expressions we calculate the central quantity @xmath129 as described in the next section .",
    "to understand the cooling effect , consider the small change in entropy for a system depending on temperature and field : @xmath130 for an isentropic process ( @xmath131 ) , the system s temperature changes in response to a small field change according to : @xmath132 when this quantity is negative it represents a decrease of system s temperature as the field is adiabatically increased : cooling .",
    "in contrast , a positive sign indicates heating .",
    "importantly , the sign and magnitude of @xmath133 depend on @xmath106 and @xmath105 . since @xmath134 is always positive , to find cooling we require a parameter regime in which @xmath135 is positive .",
    "this will occur when @xmath136 dominates the total entropy .",
    "the orange and purple dashed lines are constant field cuts ( @xmath137 mt ) of @xmath133 corresponding to the orange and purple dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempwindow ] with ( a ) and without ( b ) anyons . notice that @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is defined by the temperature below which @xmath140 in a system without 3d majoranas , and @xmath141 , the upper bound of the cooling window , is defined as the temperature below which the non - abelian entropy strongly enhances the cooling effect in a system with 3d majoranas .",
    ", width=326 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtdb ] we show the temperature dependence , both with and without 3d anyons in the system , for a fixed value of field : @xmath142 . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath143 is very similar in both cases , but below a certain temperature , @xmath139 , the system without 3d anyons will experience heating while the system with 3d anyons will experience cooling .",
    "this qualitative difference is the harbinger of 3d non - abelian anyons .    to reiterate : weak cooling may occur at high temperatures with or without 3d anyons , but in a specific region of the @xmath144-plane , depicted in dark blue in fig  [ fig : tempwindow]a , a system with 3d anyons will exhibit strong cooling while a system without 3d anyons will experience heating ( as shown in fig  [ fig : tempwindow]b ) . for a system with 3d anyons ,",
    "the transition between the strong cooling and weak cooling regimes is defined by the extremum of the curve @xmath143 which is most apparent by examining the purple dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtdb ] .",
    "the sign and magnitude of @xmath145 determines the nature of the cooling or heating effect as the magnetic field is adiabatically increased .",
    "when 3d majoranas are present ( a ) , a sizable temperature window @xmath146 at intermediate fields ( darker blue region labelled `` strong cooling '' ) will exhibit a strong cooling effect . without 3d majoranas",
    "( b ) , the same parameter regime will demonstrate a heating effect .",
    "the yellow region below @xmath147 is where the ground state degeneracy is split by majorana - majorana tunneling ; oscillations are not shown for clarity .",
    "this interesting sector may include collective anyon excitations generalizing some ideas in 2d @xcite , but these are not pertinent to this paper . , width=326 ]    to understand the origin of the minor heating without anyons note that , in the regimes relevant to our proposal , all contributions to the entropy are non - decreasing functions of @xmath105 _ except _ @xmath126 .",
    "this part of the entropy _ decreases _ with field and thus @xmath148 could become negative if @xmath126 were large enough compared to all the other entropy sources . since @xmath149 is always positive , the possibility of negative @xmath148 means @xmath150 could be driven positive leading to the observation of heating with an adiabatic increase of the field .",
    "indeed , in the absence of 3d non - abelian anyons this is exactly what happens at low temperatures as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempwindow]b",
    ". however , the presence of 3d non - abelian anyons contributes @xmath102 to the total entropy which increases sufficiently rapidly with @xmath105 that it overwhelms the low temperature heating due to @xmath126 and reverses the trend to produce a dramatic strong cooling effect .",
    "in summary , we have quantitatively estimated a magnetic field and temperature regime in which an experiment might detect 3d non - abelian anyons in a heterostructure device composed of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . within this regime , a system with 3d non",
    "- abelian anyons will experience a decrease in temperature as the magnetic field is adiabatically increased .",
    "in contrast , a system without 3d non - abelian anyons under identical conditions will exhibit a temperature increase as the magnetic field is adiabatically increased . in the strong cooling region ,",
    "the effect is rather large .",
    "for example , at @xmath151 and @xmath152 k we have @xmath153 k / t , which should be detectable with present technology .",
    "we close by enumerating a few caveats that are specific to cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , but not to the general idea of our proposal .",
    "first , the numbers presented in this paper are based on a value of the superconducting gap inferred from the @xmath26-derived coherence length @xcite which disagrees with the @xmath29 derived gap @xcite . since the degeneracy splitting ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath147 line ) is exponentially sensitive to this parameter , the choice is very important .",
    "we hope a direct experimental measurement of the superconducting gap will be made in the future to pin down the true value of this important parameter .",
    "second , we have assumed the sign of @xmath48 to take opposite values in insulating bi@xmath0se@xmath1 versus cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . without the sign change",
    ", there will be no majorana mode .",
    "again , this needs to be experimentally checked for cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that if later experimental investigations determine that either @xmath18 in cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is much smaller than our assumption , or that @xmath48 does not change sign in cu@xmath12bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , the general idea of this proposal will not be invalidated but only its applicability to this particular superconductor ; all qualitative conclusions will remain true for _ any _ insulator - superconductor system that satisfies the following conditions : ( i ) the superconductor must have a relatively large s - wave gap and be strongly type ii ; ( ii ) the band gap must take opposite signs in the insulating and superconducting regions .",
    "these are relatively simple conditions to fulfill .",
    "we chose to examine a bi@xmath0se@xmath1-based structure because this material has emerged as an archtype topological insulator which is being independently studied by many different research institutions .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of creating topological insulator regions and superconducting regions simply by p - doping or n - doping the same parent compound makes bi@xmath0se@xmath1 a very attractive system for building heterostructure devices in the future .",
