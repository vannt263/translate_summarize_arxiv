    "the heavy mass of the top - quark necessarily implies that it couples more strongly to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector than any other quark or lepton , and suggests that the top - quark itself may play a role in electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the top triangle moose model @xcite is a consistent low - energy effective theory for models with separate sectors for dynamically generating the masses of the top quark and the weak vector bosons .",
    "it can be used to investigate the phenomenology of a wide range of theories that include new strong top quark dynamics @xcite . in previous work",
    "@xcite the authors have investigated the phenomenology of the scalar sector of the top - triangle model , and have explored the constraints placed on the  top - higgs \" boson present in these models by searches at the lhc for a standard model higgs boson .",
    "we concluded that the top - higgs boson mass was constrained to lie above 300 gev for the region of top triangle moose parameter space corresponding to numerous strong dynamics models .    in this work we update our results on top - higgs searches in light of new data from the lhc and consider bounds on the  top - pions \" that are also present .",
    "in particular , we explore the possibility that the new boson with a mass of approximately 125 gev @xcite observed at the lhc is consistent with a neutral pseudoscalar top - pion state .",
    "we demonstrate that a neutral pseudoscalar top - pion can generate the diphoton signal at the observed rate .",
    "however , the region of model parameter space where this is the case does not correspond to classic topcolor - assisted technicolor scenarios with degenerate charged and neutral top - pions and a top - higgs mass of order @xmath0 ; rather , additional isospin violation would need to be present and the top dynamics would be more akin to that in top seesaw models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the new state as a top - pion can be sustained only if the @xmath1 ( four - lepton ) and @xmath2 ( two - lepton plus missing energy ) signatures initially observed at the 3@xmath3 level decline in significance as additional data is accrued .    on one level ,",
    "the top triangle moose model is an example of a deconstructed higgsless model of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "inspired by the possibility of maintaining perturbative unitarity in extra - dimensional models through heavy vector resonance exchanges in lieu of a higgs @xcite , higgsless models were initially introduced in an extra - dimensional context as @xmath4 gauge theories living in a slice of @xmath5 , with symmetry breaking codified in the boundary condition of the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "the low energy dynamics of these extra - dimensional models can be understood in terms of a collection of 4-d theories , using the principle of `` deconstruction '' @xcite .",
    "essentially , this involves latticizing the extra dimension , associating a 4-d gauge group with each lattice point and connecting them to one another by means of nonlinear sigma models ; the picture that emerges is called a `` moose '' diagram  @xcite . the five dimensional gauge field is now spread in this theory as four dimensional gauge fields residing at each lattice point , and the fifth scalar component residing as the eaten pion in the sigma fields .",
    "the key features of these models @xcite that are relevant to our discussion are as follows : spin-1 resonances created by the strong dynamics underlying the sigma fields are described as massive gauge bosons , following the hidden - local - symmetry scenario originally used for qcd  @xcite and also the bess @xcite models .",
    "the phenomenology of those resonances in the top triangle moose have been discussed in refs .",
    "standard model ( sm ) fermions reside primarily on the exterior sites  the sites approximately corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath7 gauge groups ; these fermions become massive through mixing with massive , vector - like fermions located on the interior , ` hidden ' sites .",
    "the phenomenology of these fermions has previously been discussed in @xcite .",
    "precision electroweak parameters  @xcite , are accommodated by adjusting the sm fermion s distribution across sites @xcite to match the gauge boson distribution , a process called `` ideal delocalization '' @xcite .",
    "this is identical to the solution used in extra - dimensional higgsless models , where the spreading of a fermion among sites becomes a continuous distribution , or profile , in the extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 correspondence suggests that these weakly - coupled higgsless models can be understood to be dual to the strongly coupled models of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed the top triangle moose is a deconstructed analog of topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) @xcite , a scenario of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in which the new strong dynamics is partitioned into two different sectors .",
    "the technicolor sector @xcite is responsible for the bulk of electroweak symmetry breaking , through condensation of a technifermion bilinear , and is therefore characterized by a scale @xmath9 , where @xmath10 246 gev is the ewsb scale .",
    "consequently , technicolor dynamics is responsible for the majority of the weak gauge boson masses and , more indirectly @xcite , the masses of the light fermions .",
    "the second strong sector , the topcolor sector @xcite , communicates directly with the top quark .",
    "its purpose is to generate a large mass for the top quark through new strong dynamics that cause top quark condensation @xcite . in generating a top - quark mass",
    ", this second sector also helps to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "if the characteristic scale of the topcolor sector is low , @xmath11 , it plays only a minor role in electroweak breaking , but can still generate a sufficiently large top - quark mass given a strong enough top - topcolor coupling . because electroweak symmetry is effectively broken twice in this scenario ,",
    "there are two sets of goldstone bosons .",
    "one linear combination of the weak - triplet goldstone bosons ( the combination primarily composed of technifermions ) is eaten to become the longitudinal modes of the @xmath12 , while the orthogonal triplet and accompanying weak singlet state remain in the spectrum .",
    "these remaining states , typically referred to as the top - pions and the top - higgs , are the focus of this paper .    the lhc evidence for a new boson is composed of several components , based on separate event samples optimized to be sensitive to the production of the new boson via gluon - fusion , via vector - boson fusion , or in association with an electroweak boson or a top - quark pair , and the subsequent decay of the boson to two photons , two massive electroweak bosons , or pairs of tau - leptons or bottom - quarks @xcite .",
    "while the totality of evidence including all subchannels provides convincing evidence of a new bosonic state ",
    "one consistent with a standard model ( sm ) higgs  the statistical significance of the different subchannels varies , and it is not yet certain that the object discovered is _ the _ higgs boson . with the current data the evidence for the new boson is strongest in the diphoton channel , with a local @xmath13-value showing that the  background - only \" hypothesis is excluded at more than the 4@xmath3 level by both experiments ( a level which is _ larger _ than would have been expected with the current data set for the sm higgs ) .",
    "the evidence in the next most sensitive decay channel , @xmath14 subsequently decaying to four charged - leptons ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) , is also strong  with a local @xmath13-value rejecting the background - only hypothesis at the 3@xmath3 level .",
    "the search for the @xmath17 decay mode , in which the @xmath18-bosons subsequently decay to @xmath15 or @xmath16 and corresponding neutrino , is less constraining since it is not possible to measure the diboson invariant mass  though the background only hypothesis is disfavored by 2 - 3 @xmath3 . finally , the evidence for the decay of the new boson to fermions , either tau - leptons or bottom - quarks , is so far inconclusive .",
    "our goal in this paper is to further the phenomenological investigation of the top - pions and top - higgs at the lhc that was started in @xcite .",

    "<S> we analyze the phenomenology of the top - pion and top - higgs states in models with strong top dynamics , and translate the present lhc searches for the standard model higgs into bounds on these scalar states . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility that the new state at a mass of approximately 125 gev observed at the lhc is consistent with a neutral pseudoscalar top - pion state . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a neutral pseudoscalar top - pion can generate the diphoton signal at the observed rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , the region of model parameter space where this is the case does not correspond to classic topcolor - assisted technicolor scenarios with degenerate charged and neutral top - pions and a top - higgs mass of order @xmath0 ; rather , additional isospin violation would need to be present and the top dynamics would be more akin to that in top seesaw models . moreover , the interpretation of the new state as a top - pion can be sustained only if the @xmath1 ( four - lepton ) and @xmath2 ( two - lepton plus missing energy ) signatures initially observed at the 3@xmath3 level decline in significance as additional data is accrued . </S>"
