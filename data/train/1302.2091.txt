    "calcium fluoride ( caf@xmath0 ) is representative of the fluoride - structured halides , an important family of ionic materials with numerous applications in high - pressure science and technology .",
    "examples of its assorted range of qualities include , excellent optical transmission properties over a wide wavelength range , a large electronic band gap , and very high elastic compressibility  [ ] .",
    "caf@xmath0 is also well known for being a fast - ion conductor , a material in which the lighter ions ( i.e. f@xmath6 ) acquire a significant mobility comparable to ionic melts at temperatures well below its fusion point  [ ] . this unusually large diffusion of fluor anions through the almost rigid matrix of calcium cations ( i.e. ca@xmath7 ) , an effect also termed as superionicity , is originated by the formation of frenkel pairs and migration of interstitial ions  [ ] .",
    "superionicity , which may be also found in other oxide- , hydride- and iodide - based complexes like y@xmath0o@xmath8 , libh@xmath9 and agi  [ ] , find an use in solid state applications as supercapacitors , batteries and fuel cells",
    ".    the intrinsic variety of condensed matter phases in caf@xmath0 ( i.e. solid , _ superionic _ and liquid ) _ a priori _ suggests a rich and very intriguing @xmath10 phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless , most of the experimental and theoretical investigations performed so far have focused on very narrow low - pressure and low - temperature thermodynamic ranges .",
    "the @xmath11 polymorphism of caf@xmath0 encompasses two main crystal structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the low - pressure face - centered cubic fluoride phase ( space group @xmath12 ) and the high - pressure orthorhombic pbcl@xmath0-type ( cotunnite ) phase ( space group @xmath13 ) .",
    "although caf@xmath0 fast - ion conduction has been intensively investigated at ambient pressures  [ ] , it surprisingly remains yet unexplored in the cubic and orthorhombic phases under compression .",
    "gathering information on the pressure dependence of caf@xmath0 fast - ion conduction and melting however turns out to be very desirable both from a fundamental and technological point of view .",
    "assuming fast - ion conduction behavior in both low- and high - pressure phases , for instance , opens the possibility for the existence of _ special _ triple or even quadruple points ( i.e. thermodynamic states in which several superionic and solid phases might coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium ) at elevated @xmath10 conditions .",
    "also , our present knowledge on the fusion properties of caf@xmath0 and of ionic compounds in general , is unfortunately rather scarce  [ ] .",
    "likewise , the expected connections between atomic sub - lattice melting and homogeneous melting , a subject that we have recently investigated in ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0  [ ] , are not yet clearly understood . on the practical side ,",
    "pressure - induced trends unravelled in caf@xmath0 could be generalized to other fluoride - structured materials composed of heavy and light ion species , that have been proposed or are used in relevant technological applications ( e.g. transition metal hydrides in hydrogen storage cells and uranium dioxide for generation of nuclear fuel ) .    in this article , we report the phase diagram of caf@xmath0 under pressure ( e.g. @xmath1  gpa ) as obtained from classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations performed with a simple but reliable rigid - ion interatomic potential of the born - mayer - huggings ( bmh ) form .",
    "our results rely on extensive one- and two - phase coexistence simulations and reveal a rich variety of previously unreported @xmath10 phase boundaries  [ ] ( i.e. fluoride - pbcl@xmath0 , fluoride - liquid , pbcl@xmath0-liquid , fluoride - superionic fluoride , pbcl@xmath0-superionic pbcl@xmath0 , superionic fluoride - pbcl@xmath0 and superionic fluoride - superionic pbcl@xmath0 ) , for all which we provide here an accurate parametrization .",
    "for example , we find that both fluoride - superionic fluoride and pbcl@xmath0-superionic pbcl@xmath0 phase boundaries , @xmath14 , are linearly dependent on pressure with a small and positive @xmath15 slope of @xmath16 and @xmath17  k / gpa , respectively .",
    "interestingly , we predict the existence of three _ special _ triple points involving coexistence of fluoride - superionic fluoride - pbcl@xmath0 , superionic fluoride - pbcl@xmath0-superionic pbcl@xmath0 and superionic fluoride - superionic pbcl@xmath0-liquid phases , within a narrow and experimentally accessible region of @xmath3  gpa and @xmath4  k. in addition to these findings , we use a free - energy perturbative approach to evaluate the shift in melting temperature caused by mild variations of the employed potential parameters . by doing this ,",
    "we quantify the role of repulsive and dispersion interactions on our results and qualitatively gain access to the melting features of bmh potentials used in other works .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the computational methods employed and the low - temperature performance of the selected born - mayer - huggings potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results for the phase diagram of caf@xmath0 under pressure and discuss them",
    ". then , a section follows in which we analyze the role of repulsive and dispersion interactions on the determination of melting points by theoretical means .",
    "finally , we summarize the main conclusions in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "calculations were done with lammps  [ ] , a parallel classical molecular dynamics ( md ) code comprising a large variety of potentials and different schemes for simulation of solid - state and soft materials .",
    "our md calculations are of two main types : one - phase ( i.e. pure liquid , solid and superionic phases ) and two - phase coexistence ( i.e. liquid and superionic phases coexisting in thermodynamic equilibrium ) simulations .",
    "one - phase simulations are performed in the canonical @xmath18 ensemble and two - phase coexistence simulations in the microcanonical @xmath19 ensemble ( specific details of these simulations are provided in sec .  [ sec : results ] ) . in @xmath18 simulations",
    "the temperature is kept fluctuating around a constrained value by using nose - hoover thermostats .",
    "large simulation boxes containing @xmath20 and @xmath21 atoms are used in our one - phase and two - phase coexistence simulations , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied along the three cartesian directions in all the calculations .",
    "newton s equations of motion are integrated using the customary verlet s algorithm and a time - step length of @xmath22  ps .",
    "a particle - particle particle - mesh @xmath23-space solver is used to compute long - range van der waals and coulomb interactions beyond a cut - off distance of @xmath24     at each time step .",
    "@xmath25    [ tab : potential ]    .interatomic pair potential parameters for caf@xmath0  [ ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in previous sections , we have characterized four out of the seven two - phase boundaries shown in fig .",
    "as it has been explained at the beginning of this section , we determined the remainder of boundaries ( i.e. solid - solid , solid - superionic and superionic - superionic ) based on fundamental thermodynamic considerations , one - phase md simulations , and assuming linear pressure dependence in all of them .",
    "the results so obtained are summarized in table  iv .",
    "as one can observe , the slope of the superionic fluoride - superionic pbcl@xmath0 boundary is infinite because the calculated enthalpy difference between the two superionic phases at @xmath26 is zero ( see eq .  [ eq : clausius ] ) . in the other two cases , we find that the slope of the superionic fluoride - pbcl@xmath0 boundary is positive ( i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and roughly a factor of two larger in absolute value than of the fluoride - pbcl@xmath0 boundary . in this last case ,",
    "the resulting @xmath29 slope is negative because the differences in enthalpy and volume between the two crystals are of opposite sign ( i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "in fact , _ a priori _ one would expect the entropy of the fluoride  @xmath31  pbcl@xmath0 transformation to be positive , and hence so @xmath32 , because higher symmetry structures ( i.e. cubic caf@xmath0 ) in general imply lower entropy .",
    "interestingly , we identify the presence of three _ special _ triple points , @xmath33 , in the thermodynamic region @xmath3  gpa and @xmath4  k ( see table  iv and fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "these _ special _ thermodynamic states are located at the intersections between three different phase boundaries , and the pressures and temperatures at which are predicted to occur in principle can be accessed in experiments . to this",
    "regard , information contained in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and table  iv must be considered as highly valuable since identification of coexisting superionic and liquid phases turns out to be very challenging in practice .",
    "in fact , we just know of a couple of recent experimental works wherein coexistence between superionic and liquid phases has been suggested to happen in water upon very extreme @xmath10 conditions  [ ] .    if one lifted the linear pressure dependence assumption from the solid - solid , solid - superionic and superionic - superionic phase boundaries , the location of the three _ special _ triple points @xmath33 quoted in table  iv will probably change . in order to quantify the magnitude of those variations and to assess so the accuracy in our results , one could for instance perform calculations of the gibbs - duhem integration type and exactly determine the involved multi - phase boundaries  [ ] .",
    "gibbs - duhem integration calculations and other equivalent exact schemes  [ ] however are computationally very intensive so that we opted for a more straightforward test .",
    "in particular , we computed the value of the @xmath29 slope at states @xmath34 found at halfway of the approximated linear multi - phase boundaries ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , and checked whether these differed appreciably or not from those reported in table  iv .",
    "for the superionic cubic - superionic orthorhombic phase boundary , we find that the enthalpy difference between the two phases at @xmath35 is zero implying also an infinite slope ; assuming linear pressure dependence , therefore , seems to be adequate in this case .",
    "by contrast , at point @xmath36 belonging to the superionic fluoride - solid pbcl@xmath0 boundary we obtain a @xmath29 value that is roughly twofold larger than the obtained at the corresponding _ special _ triple point @xmath37  .",
    "however , the extend of this last two - phase boundary is so reduced that we may still assume that the resulting @xmath33 inaccuracies are reasonably small .",
    "certainly , at state @xmath38 of the cubic - orthorhombic phase boundary we find @xmath39  k / gpa which is in very good agreement with the constant assumed value of @xmath40  k / gpa reported in table  iv .",
    "these outcomes come to show that assuming linear pressure dependence in all two - phase boundaries involving superionic and crystal structures provides very consistent results , in spite of the small errors introduced in the superionic cubic - solid orthorhombic boundary .",
    "consequently , our _ special _ triple point estimations can be safely considered as accurate .",
    "in contrast to _ ab initio _ electronic band structure methods , empirical and semi - empirical force fields may suffer from versatility and transferability issues .",
    "this means that an interaction model which correctly describes a set of properties may fail at reproducing others and/or the same under different thermodynamic constraints .",
    "actually , a considerable number of caf@xmath0 pairwise potentials are found in the literature each having been designed for a distinct purpose  [ ] . trying to derive the phase diagram for all of them would indeed be a tedious and extremely boring task .",
    "fortunately , once the phase stability properties of a given interatomic potential are known it is possible to deduce those for other similar interaction models in a computationally efficient and physically insightful way .",
    "we refer here to the original free - energy perturbative approach developed by gillan and collaborators and which has been successfully applied to the study of transition metals under extreme @xmath10 conditions  [ ] . in this section ,",
    "we use gillan s ideas to compute the shift in melting temperature caused by mild variations of the potential parameters employed through this work ( i.e. under the general transformation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 correspond to the set of parameters reported in table  i ) .",
    "the motivation for this analysis is not only to gain access to the phase diagram features of other similar bmh potentials but to understand also the general role of short- and long - ranged interactions in melting .",
    "a brief description of gillan s free - energy perturbative approach is provided next .    for a given @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the difference @xmath45 between the gibbs free energies of the _ new _ liquid and solid ( i.e. obtained with",
    "the _ new _ set of potential parameters @xmath46 ) deviates from the corresponding difference @xmath47 of the initial reference liquid and solid ( i.e. obtained with the reference set of potential parameters @xmath42 shown in table  i ) , and we write : @xmath48 the shift @xmath49 caused by changing the total - energy function from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , induces a shift in the corresponding melting temperature @xmath52 .",
    "to first order , the latter shift is  [ ] : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the difference between the entropies of the liquid and solid ( i.e. the entropy of fusion ) of the initial reference system , and @xmath55 is evaluated at the melting temperature of the initial reference system .",
    "the shift @xmath55 is the difference of shifts of gibbs free energies of the liquid and solid caused by the shift @xmath56 . under constant volume and temperature , the shift of helmholtz free energy @xmath57 arising from @xmath58 is given by the well - known expansion : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the averages are taken in the initial reference ensemble . from @xmath57",
    ", we obtain the shift of gibbs free energy at constant pressure as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 stands for the isothermal compressibility and @xmath64 is the change of pressure caused by the replacement @xmath65 at constant @xmath66 and @xmath44 .     caused by the variation of potential parameters at @xmath67  gpa and @xmath68  k. _ top _ : short - range repulsive @xmath69 and @xmath70 parameters are varied and the rest of parameters kept fixed .",

    "_ bottom _ : long - range attractive @xmath71 and @xmath72 parameters are varied and the rest of parameters kept fixed .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    our @xmath73 calculations were done over series of @xmath74 points ( @xmath75 , where @xmath76 refer to the reference potential parameters reported in table  i ) generated in the range @xmath77 and taken at 1  % intervals ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the averages involved in these calculations were computed over @xmath78 liquid and solid configurations generated in long one - phase md simulations performed with the reference bmh potential .",
    "these md simulations were carried out at the arbitrarily selected state @xmath79 lying over the superionic fluoride - liquid phase boundary .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows our @xmath73 results expressed as a function of @xmath80 and @xmath81 variations ( i.e. we have neglected @xmath82 fluctuations ) . as one may appreciate , significant variations of the short - ranged and long - ranged parts of the interatomic potential in general have only a moderate effect on @xmath83 .",
    "for instance , @xmath84 and @xmath85 relative variations of @xmath86  % provoke at most melting temperature shifts of @xmath87  k. this result is surprising but at the same time reassuring in the sense that it adds robustness to our @xmath83 conclusions drawn in the previous section .",
    "now , let us focus on the @xmath73 shifts caused by individual @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 variations .",
    "we note that due to the perturbative character of our approach the total melting temperature shift provoked by a general @xmath92 transformation is equal to the sum of @xmath93 shifts caused by the individual @xmath76 fluctuations . concerning the short - ranged part of the interaction model ( see top of fig .  [ fig7 ] ) ,",
    "we find that reduction of the @xmath88 parameter causes a positive melting temperature shift ; by constrast , increase of the same parameter leads to @xmath94 .",
    "this outcome comes to show that strengthening  ( weakening ) of the repulsive f - f interactions tends to further stabilize  ( destabilize ) the liquid phase .",
    "interestingly , we observe the opposite trend for @xmath89 : @xmath95 fluctuations lead to @xmath94 ( i.e. the liquid phase is energetically favored ) whereas @xmath96 lead to @xmath97 ( i.e. the liquid phase is energetically disfavored ) . upon a same @xmath98 change ,",
    "we observe that the melting temperature shift obtained in the @xmath88 case is smallest ( in absolute value ) ( e.g. @xmath99 and @xmath100  k for @xmath101 and @xmath102  % , respectively ) thus repulsive ca - f interactions play a more dominant role in melting . regarding the long - ranged attractive part of the interaction model ( see bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , the situation is the opposite than just explained . in particular , @xmath103 changes lead to @xmath104 and @xmath105 to @xmath106 . moreover , upon a same @xmath107 variation the melting temperature shift obtained in the @xmath90 case is largest ( in absolute value ) ( e.g. @xmath108 and @xmath109  k for @xmath110 and @xmath111  % , respectively ) thus attractive f - f interactions play a more important role in melting . as a summary of these results , we can state that short - ranged repulsive ca - f and long - ranged attractive f - f contributions to melting are most notorious and that reduction  ( increase ) of the involved paremeters @xmath89 and @xmath90 leads to further stabilization  ( destabilization ) of the liquid over the cubic superionic phase .",
    "finally , we can use our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] to predict , at least at a qualitative level , the melting features corresponding to other caf@xmath0 bmh potentials .",
    "in particular , we examine two parametrizations independently proposed by gillan  [ ] and boulfelfel  [ ] . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider here only @xmath73 contributions stemming from the dominant @xmath89 and @xmath90 parameters . for gillan s parametrization",
    ", we obtain @xmath112  % and @xmath113  % .",
    "actually , these values turn out to be exceedingly large so as to being treated within our perturbative approach however we can make a qualitative statement based on the size and sign of those deviations . in particular , the @xmath90 difference is eminently the largest and positive so that the resulting temperature correction is very likely to be positive and large ( i.e. @xmath114  k ) . in the case of boulfelfel s potential ,",
    "we obtain @xmath115  % and @xmath116  % .",
    "these values are of opposite sign to gillan s and still too large so as to being analyzed with our method . nevertheless , at the qualitative level",
    ", we can state that the resulting @xmath73 difference is very likely to be negative and small since the @xmath90 deviation is negative and only slightly superior than @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath117  k ) .",
    "as a concluding remark to this section we want to mention that the computational strategy just presented can also be applied to the analysis of multi - phase boundaries others than melting , and in general to the modelling of atomic interactions for derivation of phase diagrams .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the phase diagram of caf@xmath0 under pressure using classical atomistic simulations and a simple pairwise interatomic potential of the born - mayer - huggings form .",
    "our results show that a rich variety of crystal , superionic and liquid phases coexist within the thermodynamic region @xmath1  gpa and @xmath2  k. in particular , we find seven different two - phase boundaries for all of which we provide an accurate parametrization .",
    "interestingly , three _ special _",
    "triple points are predicted to exist within the narrow and experimentally accessible thermodynamic range of @xmath3  gpa and @xmath4  k. indeed , we believe that these stimulating findings should encourage new experimental searches in caf@xmath0 under elevated @xmath10 conditions .",
    "also , we have analyzed the role of short - ranged repulsive and long - ranged attractive atomic interactions in the prediction of melting points , with the finding that repulsive ca - f and attractive f - f contributions are most notorious . in order",
    "to get rid of possible versatility and transferability force - field issues , it would be very much desirable to conduct _ ab initio _ simulation studies similar to the one presented here .",

    "<S> we study the phase diagram of calcium fluoride ( caf@xmath0 ) under pressure using classical molecular dynamic simulations performed with a simple pairwise interatomic potential of the born - mayer - huggings form . </S>",
    "<S> our results obtained under conditions @xmath1  gpa and @xmath2  k reveal a rich variety of multi - phase boundaries involving different crystal , superionic and liquid phases , for all which we provide an accurate parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we predict the existence of three _ special _ triple points ( i.e. solid - solid - superionic , solid - superionic - superionic and superionic - superionic - liquid coexisting states ) within a narrow and experimentally accessible thermodynamic range of @xmath3  gpa and @xmath4  k. also , we examine the role of short - ranged repulsive ( sr ) and long - ranged attractive ( la ) atomic interactions in the prediction of melting lines with the finding that sr ca - f and la f - f contributions are most decisive .        </S>",
