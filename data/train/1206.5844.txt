    "over 50 years ago , anderson showed that a metal - insulator transition can arise due to localization of particles by scattering on a disorder potential.@xcite since then , anderson localization has evolved into an important topic of condensed matter physics , photonics , and ultracold atom gases.@xcite while the basic localization mechanism can be understood on a single - particle basis , a complete investigation needs to include further interactions , especially if they compete against localization . to study such a competition",
    "it would be advantageous to control the interactions externally , and to pass through the metal - insulator transition on demand .",
    "here we show that this can indeed be achieved in the presently much investigated one - dimensional ( 1d ) helical conductors through an external magnetic field .",
    "helical conductors are characterized by spin - filtered transport , in which opposite spins ( or kramers partners ) are bound to the right ( @xmath0 ) and left ( @xmath1 ) moving conduction modes . in conventional 1d conductors ,",
    "even weak disorder is already sufficient to turn the conductor into an insulator@xcite by disorder - induced backscattering between the fermi points @xmath2 . in a helical conductor ,",
    "however , backscattering is only possible together with a spin - flip , and the conductor is insensitive to normal , spin - preserving disorder scattering.@xcite    helical conductors appear at the edges of topological insulators,@xcite or in quantum wires@xcite or nanotubes@xcite with strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "they have attracted much attention recently as they allow for spin - filtering , @xcite cooper pair splitting , @xcite and , if in contact with a superconductor , the realization of majorana end states.@xcite while localization can not occur in a perfect helical conductor , many of the investigated conductors are imperfect and we call them `` quasi - helical '' : the spins moving in opposite directions are not perfectly antiparallel .",
    "they provide the handle to tune localization externally .",
    "examples are semiconductor nanowires with strong soi in the presence of a uniform magnetic field@xcite or , without soi , of a spiral magnetic field,@xcite which can also take the form of a spiral overhauser field due to ordered nuclear spins.@xcite    the soi shifts the spin @xmath3 bands by the wave vectors @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ bands ] , dashed lines ) . a magnetic field",
    "@xmath5 perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis has now two effects .",
    "it lifts the degeneracy at @xmath6 by opening a pseudo - gap ( fig .",
    "[ bands ] , solid lines ) , and it breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "tuning the fermi level to the center of the pseudo - gap by letting @xmath7 allows conduction only through the modes close to momenta @xmath8 with opposite spins . through @xmath5 , however , these spins are no longer antiparallel , disorder backscattering becomes again possible , and localization can occur .    in this paper",
    "we provide a unified approach to such localization , taking into account disorder , magnetic field , spin overlaps , and electron interactions .",
    "we formulate a two - step renormalization group ( rg ) approach within the luttinger liquid ( ll ) framework that provides us with a transparent picture of the underlying physics .",
    "we consider the zero temperature case , valid if the temperature is smaller than any of the gap sizes .    as a result",
    ", we find that varying @xmath5 can cause localization transitions of two kinds .",
    "a localized system@xcite at @xmath9 can make a transition to a quasi - helical conductor at a critical field @xmath10 lying ( for the example of inas nanowires ) in the range up to @xmath11 t. this transition is quite abrupt and appears when the @xmath5 generated pseudo - gap overcomes the disorder gap , and the quasi - helical state is lower in energy .",
    "the transition is marked by a rapid increase of the localization length @xmath12 , and the system is conducting if @xmath12 is greater than the system length @xmath13 . through the equal - spin overlap , @xmath14 then becomes strongly @xmath5 dependent and decreases with increasing field . at a larger critical field @xmath15 t ,",
    "when @xmath16 , backscattering between @xmath17 causes again localization , resulting in a @xmath18 modulated density wave coexisting with the transverse spin polarization generated by @xmath5 .",
    "this coexistence of density wave and uniform polarization distinguishes this phase from conventional localization , and we shall call it `` sub - gap localization . '' for very strong disorder , the helical phase is suppressed ( @xmath19 ) , and a transition takes place directly between the two localized phases .",
    "we show concrete results for inas nanowires in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] below .",
    "the underlying physics , however , is general and applies to many materials , except for the edge states of topological insulators due to their different band structure .",
    "for the latter , quasi - helicity can still be obtained , but has different interesting consequences.@xcite    the plan of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "to study a disordered interacting conductor in 1d , it is generally convenient to bosonize eq .   and use an rg approach . for the present model , however , this approach exhibits some peculiarities .",
    "first , the overlap integrals depend on @xmath55 and the problem is no longer scale invariant , a central assumption for rg .",
    "second , the low - energy physics below the scale set by @xmath31 is described mostly by the band @xmath22 . hence , the rg procedure of reducing the energy scale can lead to a problematic crossing the bottom of the @xmath23 band , which also invalidates the bosonization formulation that neglects the band curvature .",
    "while the exact treatment of every aspect would require a separate investigation , the following two observations allow us to still implement a global rg scheme capturing the relevant physics in a transparent way .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ overlap ] shows that the spin overlaps above @xmath31 approach their asymptotics only slowly with increasing energy @xmath24 ( as @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) . considering constant overlaps evaluated , e.g. , at half of the high energy cutoff scale yields a valid , rather conservative estimate of the true influence of the overlaps .",
    "second , the interactions also renormalize @xmath31 and it grows quickly under the rg flow.@xcite hence the reduced rg bandwidth @xmath24 meets the growing @xmath31 at a value @xmath58 well above the bottom of the @xmath23 band , at which the linearity of the bare dispersion remains valid .    due to these two properties ,",
    "we propose a unified two - step rg approach to the effect of disorder based on the ll theory . in the first step",
    ", we integrate over high energies far above @xmath31 using a constant backscattering overlap and the standard inclusion of the disorder potential.@xcite if the disorder is strong enough , localization already occurs in this regime by the conventional backscattering mechanism .",
    "otherwise , at @xmath59 , we proceed to the second step .    crossing the gap @xmath60 corresponds to freezing out the interaction - generated density fluctuations that renormalize @xmath31 , and",
    "hence is not a singular transition through the true band bottom .",
    "while the description of the proper transition may be quite challenging , the physics below @xmath60 becomes again simple .",
    "it is described by a different ll theory for the modes originating from the @xmath22 band only.@xcite in this regime it is legitimate to use a larger spin overlap value and , within the accuracy of ll and rg theories , we choose to take the overlaps at the chemical potential @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "[ overlap ] , inset ) .",
    "the evaluation of the disorder backscattering ( the second rg step ) follows then the standard lines of a spinless ll , and localization occurs if @xmath16 .",
    "above the pseudo - gap , all fluctuations of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands must be taken into account .",
    "as we account for the overlap integrals separately , the standard @xmath61 basis rather than the @xmath62 basis@xcite is more convenient for bosonizing .",
    "the electron operators are decomposed into @xmath0 and @xmath1 moving components as @xmath63 , for @xmath64 the two fermi points of the ( nominal ) spin @xmath65 bands .",

    "the second rg step starts when the growing @xmath31 meets the reduced bandwidth @xmath24 at @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath23-band fields are then fully gapped,@xcite and the low - energy theory is described by the fields related to the @xmath22 band alone .",

    "we have neglected here also a marginal coupling between @xmath22 and @xmath23 fields@xcite because it affects mostly the fermionic response@xcite but not the bosonic theory .",
    "disorder can be expressed by a random potential @xmath44 with gaussian distribution@xcite that scatters between the bands @xmath87 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is described by the dimensionless disorder strength @xmath88 , proportional to the square of the strength of each individual scattering potential , which in turn is proportional to @xmath89 , hence @xmath90 . following the standard replica disorder averaging",

    "we have neglected scattering between @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 after verifying that it has no effect .",
    "we have also defined @xmath99 with @xmath100 the running effective bandwidth , for @xmath101 and fermi velocity @xmath102.@xcite the latter equations express the competition between disorder backscattering and the delocalizing effect by repulsive interactions@xcite and by @xmath5 induced spin - flip scattering .",
    "localization occurs when the latter is not strong enough such that @xmath103 ( @xmath104 remains small above the gap ) before we reach @xmath59 ( @xmath105 ) or @xmath106 .",

    "the localization length is @xmath138 with @xmath139 the scale at which the rg flow stops ( in the first or the second step ) .",
