    "the quantum world has many bizarre behaviors  @xcite , such as wave - particle duality and heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "one of them is why most of atoms and molecule found in nature are capable of evolving towards and staying at their ground states , the lowest energy states .",
    "otherwise , no atom and no molecule will be stable in nature and the world would be completely out of order .",
    "the ground states , and the stationary states in general , are described by schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics  @xcite",
    ". however nobody knows any deeper principle underlying the equation .",
    "this paper attempts to show that the equation can be derived from a global optimization algorithm , called cooperative optimization  @xcite .",
    "indeed , from a computational point of view , each atomic system needs to follow a global optimization process so that it can find its ground state , the lowest energy state .",
    "cooperative optimization describes a system with multiple agents , each with its own objective , working together under cooperation to make a joint decision to optimize the collected objectives of individuals .",
    "the same language of mathematics can be used to describe a molecule of multiple atoms and a game of multiple players .",
    "cooperative optimization offers a mathematical framework to understand the computational properties of multi - agent systems under different competition and cooperation strategies .",
    "specifically , if every agent in a multi - agent system accepts only the best action and rejects all sub - optimal ones for the agent , it leads to a direct competition among the agents .",
    "if an equilibrium under this kind of competition is reached , it will be shown in section  3 that it is a nash equilibrium  @xcite defined in game theory .",
    "nash equilibrium is a key concept in game theory to understand games with rational players .    in contrary to the above scenario ,",
    "if every agent is less aggressive at competition and is willing to accept sub - optimal actions to some degree , it leads to a cooperation among the agents .",
    "if an equilibrium under this kind of cooperation is reached , it will be shown in section  2 that it is a stationary state described by schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics .",
    "compared with competition , cooperation can greatly increase the possibility for a multi - agent system to find its global optimal equilibrium state .    taking a molecule with multiple atoms as an example ,",
    "if every atom is extremely aggressive at fighting for the best location in terms of potential energy described by classical physics , the molecule follows a local optimization process and will get stuck into one local minimum energy state or another , rather than the global one .",
    "therefore , the molecule is not stable because it may have an enormous number of local minimal energy states and its final state can be any one of them , sensitive to its initial configuration and perturbations during the process .",
    "contrary to that , if every atom accepts sub - optimal locations to a certain degree while keeping the best location of the highest acceptance , the molecule tends to follow a global optimization process and evolves towards the lowest energy state ( the global minimal energy state ) . in this case , the molecule becomes stable , in - sensitive to its initial configuration and perturbations during the process . at the end , all the atoms in the molecule jointly get the best possible locations both in a global sense and in an average sense .    if each atom accepts only the best location , it will have a precise location in space at any given time instance .",
    "that is the picture of classic physics at understanding the world .",
    "different from that , if each atom accepts all locations , the best and sub - optimal ones , proportional to their goodness , its location will be spread in space with a probability - like distribution .",
    "that is exactly the physical reality of the quantum world .",
    "accepting sub - optimal actions as a generic decision - optimization strategy is truly an inspiration of the quantum world .",
    "it offers the definition of another type of equilibrium points of @xmath0-player games besides nash equilibrium .",
    "the quantum world suggests us that , at a nash equilibrium , if every player gives away some payoff by accepting sub - optimal actions to some degree , each of them may actually receive a better return at a new equilibrium point than the original one . at the same time",
    ", the game playing may become more stable since the number of its equilibrium points can be reduced remarkably .",
    "sometimes , it may be reduced to a single one corresponding to the social optimum .",
    "given a society with @xmath0 individuals , assume that the objective of individual @xmath1 is described as minimizing a function @xmath2 .",
    "a simple form of cooperative optimization is defined as an iterative computation of each individual s expected returns described by a function @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for the summation over all variables except @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a constant of a small positive value .",
    "@xmath9 is a probability - like function for picking action @xmath7 proportional to @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a normalization factor defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the larger the parameter @xmath14 is , the more aggressive each individual is at minimizing his own objective function @xmath2 . at the same time , the game tends to have more equilibrium points .",
    "however , the chance for the society to reach the social ( global ) optimum is only peaked at a certain value of @xmath14 , neither too large nor too small . in this case , each individual in the game compromises his best action by accepting sub - optimal actions to some degree , different from the case when @xmath15 where only the best action is accepted ( see eq.[computingp ] ) .    in particular , when @xmath16 , the simple general form  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general3 ] ) in a continuous - time version is @xmath17 where @xmath18    following the notation from physics , denote @xmath19 as a vector @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements as @xmath22 .",
    "then the equation  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general3.2 ] ) becomes @xmath23 the above equation can be further generalized with a hermitian matrix @xmath21 .",
    "the expected return function @xmath19 is also called a wavefunction in physics .",
    "it is important to note that the equation  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general3.3 ] ) is the dual equation of the schrdinger equation , where @xmath24 is replaced by the imaginary unit @xmath1 and the normalization factor @xmath12 is not required since the equation is unitary .",
    "when the dynamic equation  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general3.3 ] ) reaches a stationary point ( equilibrium ) , the equation becomes the time - independent schrdinger equation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 can only be any one of the eigenvalues of @xmath21 .    when the parameter @xmath16 , the global optimization algorithm  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general3 ] ) in a continuous - time version becomes a dual equation of the schrdinger equation in quantum mechanics .",
    "it falls back to the time - independent schrdinger equation whenever an equilibrium point is reached .",
    "let @xmath27 be the utility function for the player @xmath1 in a game of @xmath0 players . in this case , the player @xmath1 tries to maximize his utility function @xmath28 instead of minimizing his objective function @xmath2 .",
    "both tasks are fully equivalent to each other . in this case ,",
    "( [ cooperative_optimization_general3 ] ) becomes as @xmath29 @xmath30    in ( [ mapping ] ) , when @xmath15 , the best action @xmath7 for the player @xmath1 has a non - zero probability while others have probability zero .",
    "that is , the player only accepts the best action , the one with the highest payoff @xmath31 . in this case , the player is completely selfish .",
    "if the value of @xmath14 is reduced from the above extreme case , the player @xmath1 starts to accept sub - optimal actions by assigning non - zero probability to them .",
    "the degree of the acceptance increases with further decrease of @xmath14 . at another extreme case ,",
    "when @xmath32 , each action is assigned with the same probability and the player has no preference on any one of the actions .",
    "all of the actions are treated equally and they are sampled uniformly . in this case , the player is completely selfishless .    in summary , the parameter @xmath14 is kind of describing the selfishness level of player @xmath1 .",
    "it covers the spectrum ranging from complete selfishness ( @xmath15 ) to complete selfishlessness ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "based on brouwer fixed point theorem , an equilibrium point always exists for the set of equations  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general4 ] ) given any value for the selfishness level @xmath14 .",
    "it is still true even if each player @xmath1 in the game has his own selfishness level @xmath34 , possibly different from the rest .    from eq .",
    "( [ mapping ] ) , it is straightforward to prove that the point is also an @xmath35-approximate nash equilibrium , where @xmath35 is inversely proportional to @xmath14 . an @xmath35-approximate nash equilibrium is a strategy profile such that no other strategy can improve the payoff by more than the value @xmath35 .",
    "in particular , a nash equilibrium  @xcite can be viewed as an @xmath36-approximate one .    when the selfishness level @xmath14 is sufficiently large ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath15 , any equilibrium point for the set of iterative equations  ( [ cooperative_optimization_general4 ] ) can be arbitrarily close to a nash equilibrium and _ vice versa_.    some experimental results are given in the following section to demonstrate the improvement on the average individual payoff and the stability of game playing by reducing the selfishness level .",
    "an example payoff matrix of the prisoner s dilemma is given as follows :     &  3,3   &  1,4   + &  4,1   & * 2,2 * +    payoffs of prisoner s dilemma under different selfishness levels are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "when the selfishness level @xmath14 reduces to one ( @xmath37 ) , the payoff for each player has an @xmath38 improvement over the one at the nash equilibrium ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a 2-player game used in other game theory literatures has the following payoff matrix :    @xmath40    this game has only one mixed nash equilibrium .",
    "payoffs of the game under different selfishness levels @xmath14 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] . at @xmath41 , the payoff of the row player has an @xmath42 improvement over the one at the nash equilibrium and an @xmath43 improvement for the column player at the same time .",
    "computer - generated societies are also used to test the impact of the selfishness level @xmath14 on the payoffs of players and the stability of the societies . in each",
    "computed generated society , each individual has a number of neighbors and his payoff function is defined by the summation of the pairwise joint actions of himself and his neighbors as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the set of the individual @xmath1 s neighbors .",
    "each function value @xmath46 is uniformly sampled from the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the neighbors of each individual are randomly picked from the entire population .",
    "the overall payoff of the society is defined as @xmath48 .    in the first experiment ,",
    "a society of @xmath49 individuals is generated where each one has @xmath50 actions and @xmath51 neighbors on average .",
    "@xmath52 nash equilbria ( @xmath53 ) are discovered together with @xmath52 ones under the selfishness level @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig_8 ] shows the overall payoffs of the first 300 ones versus the second 300 ones . from the figure we can see that , reducing",
    "the selfishness level can lead to remarkable improvements both in the overall payoff and the stability ( the stability here is defined as the fluctuation of the overall payoffs of the equilibrium points ) . at the same time",
    ", the quality of the overall payoffs has reached a new high level , where the worst of the @xmath52 equilibria under the selfishness level @xmath54 is still better than the best of the @xmath52 nash equilbria in terms of the overall payoff .",
    "a less selfish society can be more efficient than a completely selfish society in terms of finding an equilibrium with a good overall payoff . to compare the efficiency , a society of a population of @xmath55 individuals with @xmath51 actions for each and @xmath56 neighbors on average is generated . when the individuals in the society are less selfish ( @xmath57 ) , the average overall payoff of the 300 equilibria found by the society is @xmath58 . when they are completely selfish , after exploring one million of equilibria , the best overall payoff is @xmath59 , still less than the former one ( see fig .  [ fig-9 ] ) .",
    "the less selfish society spent seconds on average to find an equilibria while the completely selfish society took almost a whole day to find the one million equilibria using a laptop with a amd turionx2 dual - core mobile processor and 3 gb ram .",
    "the former is much more efficient than the latter .",
    "accepting sub - optimal actions is a general decision - optimization principle for cooperation .",
    "it defines a global optimization approach to understand quantum mechanics .",
    "it also offers a strategy for improving social stability and individual payoffs over the classic profit - maximization principle .",
    "the fundamental principle of rational decision making in classic game theory is to maximize the payoff by each player in a game .",
    "the logical justification of this principle seems obvious which shapes the definition of nash equilibrium more than 50 years ago .",
    "however , the study presented in this paper shows that the optimality of this principle is conditional .",
    "the optimal decision of each player in the classic sense may not lead to a good payoff for the player .",
    "defying the conventional wisdom , compromising it by accepting sub - optimal actions can improve both the overall payoff , equivalently the average individual payoff , and the stability of game playing .",
    "this study suggests that , for the benefit of everyone in a society ( or a financial market ) , the pursuit of maximal payoff by each individual should be controlled at some level either by voluntary good citizenship or by imposed regulations .",
