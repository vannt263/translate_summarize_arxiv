    "the study of perfect codes is a classical , and perhaps one of the most attractive topics in coding theory .",
    "the best studied case are certainly codes in the hamming metric spaces @xcite , as they are historically the first codes that were introduced and are most relevant in practice .",
    "there are various other interesting examples in the literature , however , such as perfect codes under the lee metric @xcite , levenshtein metric @xcite , codes in projective spaces @xcite , grassmanians @xcite , etc .",
    "delsarte s conjecture @xcite on the non - existence of perfect constant - weight codes under the johnson metric has also inspired a lot of research , and still remains unsolved @xcite .",
    "many of these problems can be regarded as particular instances of the general theory of perfect codes in distance - transitive graphs @xcite ( but not all cases of interest fit into this framework ) . in the present paper",
    "we investigate perfect codes in discrete simplices of arbitrary dimension . as discussed in section [ motivation ] , codes in such spaces arise naturally in the context of error correction in the so - called permutation channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic concepts used in the sequel are introduced in the following subsection .",
    "subsection [ mainresults ] summarizes the main contributions of the paper .",
    "section [ motivation ] explains the motivation for studying codes in discrete simplices ; the notion of multiset codes is introduced here and some of their properties are established .",
    "proofs of the results are given in section [ proofs ] .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the set of nonnegative integers .",
    "let @xmath11 be a finite metric space with an integer - valued metric @xmath12 , and @xmath13 an error - correcting code .",
    "elements of @xmath14 are called codewords in this context .",
    "@xmath15 is said to be @xmath3-perfect , @xmath16 , if balls of radius @xmath3 centered at codewords are disjoint and cover the entire space : @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the decoding region of the codeword @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , every element of @xmath21 is at distance @xmath22 from exactly one codeword .",
    "clearly , every singleton @xmath23 is @xmath24-perfect , with @xmath24 the diameter of the space @xmath21 , and @xmath21 itself is @xmath25-perfect . in the rest of the paper , we shall be interested only in _ nontrivial _ perfect codes  those with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 .",
    "the space under consideration in this paper is the discrete version of the standard @xmath0-simplex : @xmath29 endowed with the following metric : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "( the constant @xmath32 is taken for convenience because @xmath33 is always even for @xmath34 . )",
    "the diameter of @xmath35 under @xmath12 is clearly @xmath36 .",
    "note that for @xmath34 we can also write : @xmath37 to our knowledge , codes in this space have not been analyzed before .",
    "perfect codes under @xmath2 distance seem to have been studied only in the integer lattice @xmath38 ( as periodic extensions of the codes under the lee metric ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is particularly useful to represent the metric space @xmath39 as a graph - perfect codes are also known as efficient dominating sets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] with @xmath40 vertices , and with edges connecting vertices at distance one .",
    "this representation allows one to visualize the space under study , as well as codes in this space , at least for @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting graph is not distance - transitive and the general methods developed for such graphs @xcite can not be applied .",
    "the following theorem summarizes the main contributions of the paper .",
    "its proof is deferred to section [ proofs ] .",
    "[ thm_main ] let @xmath27 .",
    "nontrivial @xmath3-perfect code in @xmath42 exists for every @xmath6 .",
    "such a code has @xmath43 codewords .",
    "nontrivial @xmath3-perfect code in @xmath44 exists if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , there are exactly two such codes in @xmath45 , each having three codewords",
    ".    nontrivial @xmath3-perfect code in @xmath39 , @xmath46 , does not exist for any @xmath3 and @xmath36 .",
    "in addition to the existence proofs , we shall also enumerate in section [ proofs ] all perfect codes in one- and two - dimensional simplices .",
    "let @xmath47 be a finite alphabet with @xmath48 symbols .",
    "a permutation channel over @xmath49 is a communication channel that takes sequences of symbols from @xmath49 as inputs , and for any input sequence outputs a random permutation of this sequence .",
    "such channels arise , for example , in some types of packet networks @xcite in which the packets comprising a single message are routed separately and are frequently sent over different routes in the network .",
    "consequently , the receiver can not rely on them being delivered in any particular order .",
    "in addition to random permutations , the channel is assumed to impose various types of  noise \" on the transmitted sequence , such as insertions , deletions , and substitutions of symbols .",
    "for example , in a networking scenario mentioned above , packet deletions can be caused by network congestion and consequent buffer overflows in the routers , while packet substitutions ( i.e. , errors ) are usually caused by noise or malfunctioning of network equipment .",
    "therefore , the permutation channel with these types of impairments is indeed a relevant model .",
    "it is clear from the definition of the permutation channel that , when transmitting sequences through it , no information should be encoded in the order of symbols in the sequence because it is impossible to recover this information .",
    "the only carrier of information should be the _ multiset _ of the symbols sent , i.e. , the number of occurrences of each symbol from @xmath49 in the sequence .",
    "the appropriate space in which error - correcting codes for the permutation channel should be defined is therefore the set of all multisets over the channel alphabet @xcite .",
    "formally , a multiset @xmath50 is an ordered pair @xmath51 where @xmath49 is the ground set ( the channel alphabet in our case ) and @xmath52 is a multiplicity function which encodes the numbers of occurrences of the elements of @xmath53 in @xmath50 .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath50 is the number of elements it contains , including repetitions , namely @xmath54 .",
    "since the alphabet @xmath47 is fixed , multisets can be identified with their multiplicity functions , and these can be identified with @xmath55-tuples @xmath56 .",
    "the set of all multisets over @xmath49 can therefore be identified with the space @xmath57 , and the set of all multisets of given cardinality @xmath36 with @xmath58 which is precisely the discrete simplex @xmath35 .",
    "we shall focus here on the latter case only and study codes in @xmath35 , i.e. , codes whose all codewords have the same cardinality .",
    "this convention is also practically motivated because it somewhat simplifies the communication protocol @xcite . in order to study codes in @xmath35",
    ", it is convenient to introduce a metric on this space so that the minimum distance of the code can be defined , and guarantees on the number of correctable errors provided .",
    "a natural metric on the space of multisets is the so - called symmetric difference metric defined by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the symmetric difference of ( multi)sets . this is obviously the @xmath2 distance between the sequences @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we have thus shown that the metric space @xmath39 is an appropriate space for defining error - correcting codes in permutation channels .",
    "it should be pointed out that , even though we have defined codes in @xmath63 , the codewords from @xmath63 are not what is actually sent through the permutation channel , they only describe the multisets that are transmitted .",
    "namely , if @xmath64 is a codeword to be sent , then what is actually transmitted are @xmath65 copies of the symbol @xmath25 , @xmath66 copies of the symbol @xmath4 , etc .",
    "therefore , for a multiset code defined in @xmath35 , @xmath36 represents the length of the code ( the number of symbols in codewords = the cardinality of the codewords ) and @xmath67 is the size of the alphabet .",
    "note that in our setting the dimension of the code space depends on the size of the alphabet ( @xmath67 ) , not on the length of the code ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this stands in sharp contrast with most other coding scenarios .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the johnson space @xmath68 ( the set of all binary sequences of length @xmath69 and hamming weight @xmath36 ) is a subset of @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of binary sequences , the metric @xmath12 from reduces to the johnson metric . however , ( non)existence of perfect codes in @xmath35 does not imply ( non)existence of perfect codes in @xmath68 , and the methods used in this paper do not seem to be sufficient to settle delsarte s conjecture ( except in some special cases that are already known , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cor 2 ) ) .    using the above terminology",
    ", we can now restate theorem [ thm_main ] as follows :    finally , we note that the framework presented in this section is a generalization of coding in power sets @xcite , where codewords are taken to be _ sets _ rather than multisets .",
    "such approaches to coding for the permutation channel are somewhat analogous to the approach of ktter and kschischang @xcite of using codes in projective spaces and grassmanians for error correction in networks employing random linear network coding . in both cases ,",
    "the guiding idea is to define codes in the space of objects invariant under the channel transformation  ( multi)sets are invariant under permutations , whereas vector spaces are invariant ( with high probability ) under random linear combinations .",
    "we now proceed with the proof of our claim . to that end",
    ", it will be useful to represent the simplex @xmath35 as the corresponding graph with @xmath70 vertices , and with edges connecting vertices at distance one . as noted in section",
    "[ notation ] , such a representation will allow us to visualize the spaces under study , at least in the case of binary and ternary alphabets .",
    "one - dimensional case is simple to analyze .",
    "the space @xmath71 can be represented as a _ path _ with @xmath72 vertices , the leftmost vertex being @xmath73 and the rightmost @xmath74 for example ( see figure [ fig_binary ] ) .",
    "since the diameter of @xmath42 is @xmath36 and any two codewords of an @xmath3-perfect code must be at distance @xmath75 , nontrivial code can exist only if @xmath6 .",
    "it is not hard to conclude that a perfect code exists for any such @xmath36 ( see also @xcite for the case @xmath76 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_binary ] provides an illustration of such a code , and proposition [ thm_allperfbinary ] lists all perfect codes in @xmath77 .",
    "-perfect code in @xmath78 ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath76 ) .",
    "black dots represent codewords ; dots belonging to a gray region comprise the decoding region of the corresponding codeword . ]",
    "[ thm_allperfbinary ] let @xmath81 for some @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "then there are exactly @xmath84 perfect codes in @xmath77 , each having @xmath85 codewords .",
    "let also @xmath86 .",
    "then all perfect codes in @xmath77 can be enumerated as @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "considering the geometry of the space @xmath77 and the corresponding graph , it is clear that a perfect code has to be of the form @xmath89 for some fixed @xmath90 , and for @xmath91 ranging from @xmath25 to some largest value .",
    "namely , once we have fixed the  leftmost \" codeword @xmath92 , all the other codewords are determined by the fact that neighboring codewords have to be at distance @xmath93 from each other . in that way we ensure that the decoding regions are disjoint and that all intermediate points are covered . therefore , to prove that @xmath94 are perfect , i.e. , that the entire @xmath77 is covered , it is enough to show that the endpoints @xmath95 and @xmath96 are covered .",
    "assume that @xmath97 , in which case @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath100 , and hence the vertex @xmath95 is at distance @xmath22 from the codeword @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , @xmath102 and therefore the vertex @xmath96 is at distance @xmath22 from the codeword @xmath103 ( obtained for @xmath104 in ) .",
    "similar analysis applies when @xmath105 .",
    "this proves that the codes @xmath94 are perfect .",
    "it is left to prove that lists all perfect codes in @xmath77 .",
    "assume that @xmath97 .",
    "in that case the  leftmost \" codeword of @xmath94 is @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , we have found @xmath108 codes with  leftmost \" codewords @xmath109 .",
    "suppose that we try to construct another perfect code by specifying @xmath110 , @xmath111 , as its  leftmost \" codeword .",
    "since the end point @xmath95 has to be covered , we can assume that @xmath112 .",
    "then its  rightmost \" codeword is obtained by shifting for @xmath113 and is therefore either @xmath114 ( for @xmath115 ) or @xmath116 ( for @xmath104 ) .",
    "the second case is clearly impossible , and the first fails to give a perfect code because the point @xmath74 does not belong to a decoding region of some codeword ( its distance from the  rightmost \" codeword is @xmath117 ) .",
    "again , the proof is similar for @xmath105 .",
    "consider now the two - dimensional simplex @xmath8 .",
    "the graph representation of this space is a triangular grid graph , as illustrated in figure [ fig_2d_perfect ] ( we assume that the leftmost vertex corresponds to @xmath118 , the rightmost to @xmath119 , and the top to @xmath120 ) .",
    "balls under the metric @xmath12 in this graph are `` hexagons '' , perhaps clipped if the center of the ball is too close to the edge ( in fact , this space is easily seen to be a `` triangle '' cut out from the hexagonal lattice , see figure [ fig_2d_perfect ] ) .",
    "hence , we need to examine whether a perfect packing of hexagons is possible within this graph , i.e. , whether there is a configuration of hexagons covering the entire graph without overlapping .",
    "we first briefly discuss some properties of @xmath121 that will be useful .",
    "observe that , given some @xmath122 , we can express any point @xmath123 by specifying a path from @xmath20 to @xmath124 in the corresponding graph .",
    "the first node on this path , call it @xmath125 , is a neighbor of @xmath20 , the second node is a neighbor of @xmath125 , etc .",
    "the neighbors of @xmath126 , i.e. , points that are at distance @xmath4 from it , are obtained by adding @xmath4 to some coordinate of @xmath20 , and @xmath127 to some other coordinate . a convenient way of describing neighbors and paths in @xmath121 is as follows .",
    "define the vector @xmath128 , @xmath129 , to have a @xmath4 at the @xmath91th position , a @xmath127 at the @xmath90th position , and a @xmath25 at the remaining position .",
    "for example , @xmath130 . clearly , @xmath131 and by convention we take @xmath132 .",
    "these vectors describe all possible directions of moving from some point , and hence any neighbor @xmath125 of @xmath20 can be described by specifying the direction , namely @xmath133 ( see figure [ fig_directions ] ) . therefore , any @xmath123 can be expressed as @xmath134 for some integers @xmath135 .     in @xmath121 . ]    if @xmath136 , then clearly there exists a representation of this form with @xmath137 . another way to write this is @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the following lemma will also be used in the sequel .",
    "the statement is illustrated in figure [ fig_2d_l00 ] , and the proof ( of the more general version ) is given in the following subsection ( see lemma [ prop_orthogonal ] and remark [ rem_orthogonal_2d ] ) .",

    "let us elaborate on the meaning of this lemma .",

    "we now proceed with proof of the main claim , namely the ( non)existence of perfect codes . if @xmath9 , then it is not hard to exhibit a perfect code ( see figure [ fig_2d_perfect ] ) .",

    "we next show that the assumption @xmath184 also leads to a contradiction .",
    "we can assume that @xmath185 ; otherwise , the vertex @xmath165 would be covered by both @xmath20 and @xmath124 .",
