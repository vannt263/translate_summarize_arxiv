    "@xcite ; lacy et al .",
    "in addition , our knowledge of the masses of stellar black holes ( and many neutron stars and white dwarfs as well ) depends on our ability to interpret ellipsoidal and usually non - eclipsing light curves ( e.g.   avni & bahcall @xcite ; avni @xcite ; mcclintock & remillard @xcite ; haswell et al .",

    "@xcite ; ribas et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since close binary stars are of such importance , it is crucial that we have the ability to construct accurate synthetic light curves for a variety of close binaries .    the light curve expected from a particular close binary depends on the system geometry ( i.e.  the figures of the stars , their relative sizes , separation , viewing angle , etc . ) and on the radiative properties of the stars , which are set mainly by their effective temperatures , surface gravities and chemical compositions .",
    "the equations describing the basic system geometry for a close binary are reasonably simple and have been known for a long time ( e.g.  see the text by kopal @xcite ) . in practice , however , the direct computation of light curves requires a computer , and codes to compute light curves have been in use since the late 1960s ( e.g.lucy @xcite ; hill & hutchings @xcite ; wilson & devinney @xcite ; mochnacki & doughty @xcite ; avni & bahcall @xcite ; see also the review by wilson @xcite ) . on the other hand , the detailed computation of stellar atmosphere models which describe the specific intensity of radiation emitted by the stellar surfaces is quite involved . as a result",

    "the computational techniques and the input physics used to compute the nextgen models for cool giants have been discussed elsewhere ( hauschildt et al .",

    "these spherical models require an input mass to compute the sphericity factor , and we use @xmath43 for all of the models .",
    "we did examine a few models with masses of @xmath44 and @xmath45 and found no discernible differences compared to the @xmath43 models . for the moment we restrict ourselves to the models with solar metallicity .",
    "for each model the specific intensities are computed for 64 different angles over a wavelength range of 3000 - 24,998    in 2    steps .",
    "the distribution of the emergent angles @xmath32 is chosen by the phoenix code based on the structure of the atmosphere under consideration .",

( [ sqrt ] ) )",
    "computed using coefficients taken from the tabulation of van hamme ( @xcite ) .",
    "these four curves essentially show the limb darkening behaviour predicted by the kurucz models to within a few per cent , although is important to note that the intensities for @xmath55 are different between the kurucz models and the nextgen models ( see hauschildt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for further discussion of this point ) .",
    "this figure is quite striking .",
    "it shows the radically different limb darkening behaviour predicted by the spherical nextgen models and the plane - parallel kurucz models . the nextgen model predicts a sharp decrease in the intensity at relatively large @xmath32 values ( as large as @xmath56 ) , whereas the limb darkening parameterisations predict substantial intensity all the way to @xmath24",
    "this sudden decrease in the intensity is a consequence of the spherical geometry : for sufficiently low gravities ( @xmath57 for most temperatures ) there is much less material near the limbs and hence much less radiation .",
    "the radiation that would have come out near the limb in the redder bandpasses comes out at much shorter wavelengths ( see hauschildt et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the value of @xmath32 where the sudden fall - off in the intensities occurs depends on the effective temperature and gravity of the stellar model , and on the bandpass .",
    "we define the slope of the intensities at @xmath58 to be @xmath59 the location @xmath60 of the edge is defined to be the point where @xmath61 is the largest . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows contour plots of @xmath60 for three different bands ( johnson @xmath62 , @xmath48 , and @xmath52 ) .",
    "in general , for a fixed effective temperature , @xmath60 gets larger as the gravity of the model decreases .",
    "also , for a fixed @xmath18 , the hotter models tend to have a slightly larger values of @xmath60 .",
    "there is some irregular behaviour seen in the contours of @xmath60 at temperatures between about 3000  k and 4000  k. the reason for this seems to be that for models in this temperature range , the fall - off in the intensity is generally less sudden , especially in the bluer filters .",
    "thus @xmath60 is less clearly defined in these cases .",
    "it is quite obvious that the quantity @xmath27 ( eq.([eq2 ] ) ) evaluated for the nextgen intensities will be less than the corresponding quantity evaluated for a one- or two - parameter limb darkening law . for each model and filter",
    ", we computed the `` lost light '' in the following way .",
    "we first `` linearised '' our table of nextgen intensities : we fitted a line to the intensities for the ten specific angles nearest to @xmath55 .",
    "then the specific intensities for the remaining 54 angles were replaced by the intensities determined from the extrapolation of the fitted line . in most cases ,",
    "the extrapolated intensities at the limb were above zero .",
    "there were a few cases such as the @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath51-band model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the extrapolated intensities at the limb would have been negative . in such cases",

    "the lost light in many of the @xmath62-band models is zero .",
    "otherwise , for the @xmath62 band , the lost light is typically a few per cent and about 3 or 4 per cent for the hottest models .",
    "on the other hand , the lost light in the @xmath48 and @xmath52 bands can be quite substantial , up to 17 per cent for the models with lowest gravities and the hottest temperatures .",
    "we can easily make an image of the disk a model star as it would appear in the sky .",
    "the intensity maps displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] compare the nextgen intensities for @xmath53  k and @xmath54 to monochromatic black body intensities ( limb darkened using the square root law ( eq .  ( [ sqrt ] ) ) for three different filters ( johnson @xmath62 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) .",
    "the star with the nextgen intensities appears smaller on the sky .",
    "the difference in the limb darkening closer to the disk centre is also apparent from the figure .",

    "this comes as no surprise , given the potentially large differences in the limb darkening between the next - gen models and the one- or two - parameter limb darkening laws .",
    "it is usually the case ( especially in the @xmath48 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath52 filters ) that the nextgen light curves have larger amplitudes ( in normalised intensity or in magnitudes ) than the corresponding black body light curves .",

    "the top curve is the @xmath48-band light curve of the single star described in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] caption made with the linearised intensity table .",
    "since the square root limb darkening law for this model ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) and bandpass closely matches the actual nextgen intensities near disk centre ( see fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] is the light curve for the same star made with the regular nextgen intensity table , plotted on the same intensity scale .",
    "the average light level in this light curve is about 5 per cent lower than the linearised one , which is roughly what we would expect from fig .",
    "[ figlost ] .",
    "the bottom curve is the difference between the two top light curves .",
    "this lower curve is basically the light lost near the limb , and it is essentially constant with phase .",
    "the two top curves have roughly the same amplitude in these intensities units .",
    "that is , @xmath72 is the same for both curves .",
    "however , the _ relative _ amplitude @xmath73 for the regular nextgen light curve will be larger since its mean light level is lower . hence , the amplitude of this particular nextgen light curve ( and most others ) in _ normalised intensity or in magnitudes _ is larger than the amplitude of the corresponding black body curve .",
    "there are some situations such as the @xmath51 model shown in the bottom of fig .",

    "furthermore , the surface gravity near its equator is relatively low , giving rise to a relatively large range in temperatures owing to the increased gravity darkening .",
    "we currently can not model the real binary using the nextgen intensities because the mean temperature of the b - star is well outside our current model grid .",
    "indeed , there are parts on the b - star where the temperature and gravity combination fall outside the kurucz grid , so we can not model the real binary with the kurucz grid either . for this example we therefore modified the temperatures of the two stars and `` slowed down '' the mass gaining primary slightly so that the temperature and gravity combination of each point on each star is contained in both the nextgen and kurucz grids .",

    ". thus the observed profile will be nearly symmetric .",
    "however , the kernel , computed using the nextgen intensities , is _ narrower _ than the analytic kernel and the kernel computed using black body intensities and linear limb darkening since the star with the nextgen intensities appears smaller on the sky ( fig .",

    "the star is elongated in the @xmath11-direction . as a result ,",
    "the broadening kernel computed from the black body intensities is _ wider _ than the analytic kernel , and it is asymmetric . as a result of the sharp cut - off in the limb darkening , the kernel computed using the nextgen intensities in narrower than the black body kernel .",
    "however , for this particular situation , the nextgen kernel has roughly the same width as the analytic kernel . finally , at phase @xmath106 , when the giant is behind its unseen companion , all three kernels have more or less the same full width at half maximum .",
    "however , the kernel computed using the black body intensities is flat - topped ( shahbaz ( @xcite ) also noted absorption line profiles with flat bottoms near this phase ( his fig .  1 ) ) , and the kernel computed with the nextgen intensities has a local minimum at zero velocity .",
    "the reason the kernels have flat tops or even central depressions near phase @xmath106 is quite straightforward .",
    "the @xmath107 point is in full view near this phase , and for high inclinations there are no points on the apparent stellar disk with @xmath23 . for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , @xmath108 everywhere on the star at phase @xmath106 .",
    "hence the central parts of the apparent stellar disk are fainter ( owing to limb darkening ) than they would have been in the spherical case and there is less contribution to the kernel near zero velocity .",
    "if the intensities are computed using the nextgen table and the gravity is sufficiently low , then the central part of the star can be even darker . in some cases such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the @xmath107 point will be so dark that the broadening kernel will actually have a central depression near zero velocity .    given the variety of distortions in the broadening kernel as shown in fig .",

    "there is some irregular behaviour in the curves for @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in practice , however , the contribution to the overall integrated light curve from angles less than 0.1 is small since the intensities are weighted by the value of @xmath32 .",
    "another way to test the accuracy of the interpolation is to leave specific models out of the table , compute a light curve , and compare it to the light curve computed using the full intensity table .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows results of this exercise for the star described in the caption of fig .",
    "we computed `` regular '' light curves where we used all models in the intensity table and `` cut '' light curves where the @xmath49 , @xmath50 model was excluded from the table .",

    "we see that the systematic difference between the two curves is usually about 0.3 per cent and is at most 0.75 per cent in @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath48 and @xmath52 are even smaller .",
    "we also computed light curves using two different grids of surface elements : the `` standard '' grid with @xmath134 and @xmath135 and the `` fine '' grid with @xmath136 and @xmath137 . using the fine grid has little effect on",

    "the two curves are the same to within 0.05 per cent ( i.e.  less than about 0.5 millimag ) .",
    "we conclude that for most situations our regular intensity table and the standard grid are adequate .",
    "there is nothing in our integration and interpolation techniques that limits us to @xmath138 per cent accuracy .",
    "since our interpolation scheme does not have a fixed step size in the temperature or gravity we can easily add a few models with the appropriate temperatures and gravities for special cases where the data demand the highest accuracy .",
    "other light curve codes also suffer systematic errors on the few per cent level .",
    "for example , most versions of the w - d code use a single limb darkening law for the entire star .",
    "since the temperature and gravity are not constant over the surface of a tidally distorted star , small systematic errors can be present when a limb darkening law for a single temperature and gravity are used .",
    "van hamme & wilson ( @xcite ) have discussed this point in more detail .",
    "in this paper we have presented a way to include specific intensities from detailed model atmosphere computations into a light curve synthesis code .",
    "we have shown that using the model atmosphere intensities directly is almost required for cool giants since the limb darkening behaviour for a cool low - gravity atmosphere is radically different than simple one- or two - parameter limb darkening laws ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this departure from the near - linear limb darkening law is a consequence of the spherical geometry used in the computation of the nextgen models .",
    "other workers have computed spherical model atmospheres for cool giants before ( e.g.scholz & tsuji @xcite ; scholz & takeda @xcite ; plez et al .",
    "@xcite ; jrgensen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the strongly nonlinear limb darkening behaviour has previously been noted by scholz & takeda ( @xcite ) , and more recently by hofmann & scholz ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that this strongly nonlinear limb darkening has a large effect on the light curve amplitude .",
    "in general , the light curves computed using the nextgen intensities have larger amplitudes than the light curves computed using the same geometry but with black body intensities and a one- or two - parameter limb darkening law .",
    "also , the strongly nonlinear limb darkening has an effect on rotational broadening kernels in that for spherical stars the kernel computed using the nextgen intensities will be narrower than a numerical or an analytic kernel that has a linear limb darkening law .",
    "if the star fills a substantial fraction of its roche lobe , then the broadening kernel will also be different than the analytic one owing to the nonspherical shape of the star .",
    "thus we basically have two different types of models with which to fit close binary light curves : our elc code with the nextgen intensities , and codes that use either black body intensities or plane - parallel model atmosphere intensities and near - linear limb darkening ( e.g.  w - d , elc in black body mode , elc with the kurucz table , etc . ) .",
    "it should be possible to test which class of models provides the better description of the observational data available for binaries with cool giants . in this regard , we have shown that observations in several bandpasses are useful in discriminating between the models .",
    "for example , figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ rzscuti ] show how the difference in the depths of the minima between the nextgen and kurucz light curves depends on the bandpass , while fig .",

    "the orbital period is 262 days .",
    "reasonably good light curves in the bluer filters exist ( e.g.  knee et al .",
    "@xcite ; olson @xcite ) , and additional observations in @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath52 would be extremely valuable .",
    "kruszewski & semeniuk ( @xcite ) present a catalog of poorly studied eclipsing binaries with good parallaxes measured by the _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "many of these binaries have long periods ( more than 10 days ) and contain evolved cool components .",
    "needless to say , we encourage observers to systematically study these binaries in multiple colours . with a binary of known distance , one has the added challenge of obtaining the correct integrated flux .",
    "our interest should not be confined to binaries with a supergiant component .",
    "for example , there appears to be a small class of `` long period '' algol type binaries ( periods between about 10 and 20 days ) where the mass losing cool star appears to be slightly underfilling its roche lobe . some examples are ( olson & etzel @xcite ) , ( olson & etzel @xcite ) , and ( etzel & olson @xcite ) .",
    "the cool stars in these three systems have surface gravities near @xmath140 , so the sphericity effects are not as pronounced as they are in systems like . on the other hand ,",
    "all three of these binaries have excellent five - colour ( @xmath48(kron)@xmath141 ) photometry , and and are totally eclipsing and are double - lined .",
    "olson and etzel report that in each case , the cool star seems to underfill its roche lobe by about 10 per cent .",
    "it would be worthwhile to re - evaluate the light curve solutions for these three stars using elc and the nextgen intensities to see if the sphericity effects can account for the apparent slight underfilling of the roche lobes by the cool stars .",

    "situations with @xmath158 ( the contact binaries ) are currently not allowed . when @xmath159 , the program computes @xmath155 from @xmath160 and then computes @xmath161 , which is the adopted potential for the star .",
    "once the surface of the star is defined , a grid of surface elements is made using a polar coordinate system with @xmath162 latitude rows equally spaced in the angle @xmath163 and @xmath164 longitude points per latitude row equally spaced in the angle @xmath165 .",

    "the temperature of the secondary star was defined in the avni code by its polar temperature @xmath169 . given @xmath169 , the temperatures of the other surface elements followed from the well - known von zeipel relation : @xmath170^{\\beta}.\\ ] ] the exponent @xmath171 is 0.25 for stars with a radiative atmosphere ( von zeipel @xcite ) and 0.08 for stars with convective envelopes ( lucy @xcite ) .",
    "wilson ( @xcite ) has pointed out that the polar temperature and the _ mean _ temperature of a distorted star will be different . in most cases , of course , one measures the mean temperature via the spectral type or colour index .",

    "we have fully implemented wilson s treatment of the reflection effect , which is a big improvement over the scheme used by orosz & bailyn ( @xcite ) .",

    "fortunately , in most practical situations , a relatively hot star with a high surface gravity ( @xmath178 ) irradiates a much cooler star . the irradiation of the hot star by the cool star can be neglected ( in which case we do nt care about the details of the cool star limb darkening ) , and the well - known limb darkening laws apply nicely to the hot , high - gravity star .",
    "( ii )  wilson introduced the use of the @xmath179-function in the reflection scheme to allow for multiple reflection . for each element",
    ", the @xmath179-function is defined by @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the ratio of the total irradiating flux from star 2 seen at the local surface element on star 1 and @xmath182 is the reverse .",

    "alencar & vaz ( @xcite ) have computed some irradiated atmosphere models and presented limb darkening coefficients for use in light curve synthesis codes .",

    "one of us ( phh ) is in the process of computing irradiated atmospheres with the phoenix code .",
    "it should be relatively simple to include the irradiated atmospheres into the elc code , at least for specific binaries .",

    "the horizon of an object is the outline of the object in sky coordinates .",
    "a point on the disk face is visible if its sky coordinates are _ inside _ the top horizon .",
    "star 2 can block parts of the disk if its radius is relatively large . since we currently require the inner radius of the disk to be equal to the radius of star 2 ( if present ) , some or all of the `` bottom '' part of star 2 may be hidden by the disk . again",
    ", the shadowing of the disk by star 2 and the lower part of star 2 by the disk is easily accounted for by defining the suitable horizons .",
    "finally , a disk with a large radius can inhibit the mutual irradiation of the two stars since the `` top '' of star 1 can not `` see '' the `` bottom '' of star 2 , and vice - versa .",

    "indeed , linnell & hubeny ( @xcite ) create light curves for binaries with disks by first computing detailed spectra for the disk using the hubeny codes .",
    "however , the hubeny code tlusdisk is best suited for atmospheres hotter than about 10,000  k , and as such can not really be used to model the cool outer parts of many disks . as it is now ,",
    "our treatment of the accretion disk is perhaps the most appropriate for systems where the disk is optically faint and its main effect on the light curves is geometrical ( i.e.it eclipses the bright mass - losing star ) .",
    "examples of such systems are ( zola @xcite ) , ( orosz & bailyn @xcite ) , and ( benson et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      in many algol type binaries",
    "there is good evidence for a fainter third star that is gravitationally bound .",
    "for example , the @xmath88 residuals of the eclipse timings of are periodic and can be explained by the presence of a third body in a 5.8 year eccentric orbit about the inner binary ( ogloza et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in such triple systems ,",
    "the `` third light '' dilutes the observed amplitudes of the light curves from the binary , provided of course that the third star is sufficiently bright .",
    "we have a trivial way to self - consistently add third light to light curves in different bandpasses . in elc",
    ", the user specifies three parameters for the third light : the temperature of the third star , its gravity , and its surface area relative to the surface area of star 1 .",
    "the code interpolates the filter - integrated intensities for the third star from the table , scales appropriately based on the surface area ratio , and adds the light to each light curve .",
    "the integration of the observed flux from a single star is straightforward and is sufficiently accurate for a reasonably small number of surface elements .",
    "however , quantisation errors can become noticeable in the light curve of a star going through an eclipse .",
    "in many cases ( e.g.  grazing eclipses , no reflection effect ) the number of surface elements can be modestly increased so that a smooth light curve can be obtained without a large increase in the cpu time required to compute the model . in other cases ( e.g.  deep",
    "eclipses and several iterations of detailed reflection ) the number of surface elements needed to get smooth light curves becomes so large that the required cpu time becomes excessive .",
    "thus elc has two features which prove to be quite effective in greatly reducing the numerical noise of light curves though eclipse .",
    "the horizon of the eclipsing star ( the one `` in front '' ) is defined to be a collection of points on the star which have @xmath24 . in previous versions of the code ,",
    "the program would step though the surface grid in the `` @xmath199 '' direction and record which surface elements were last visible ( i.e.  the last point with @xmath200 ) .",
    "the resulting collection of sky coordinates of these surface elements would then define the horizon of the star .",
    "there is a systematic error introduced when the number of surface elements is small since the numerical horizon of the star will be slightly smaller than the actual horizon . in the current version of the code ,",
    "the program steps along each latitude row and records the @xmath165-coordinate of the last visible point @xmath201 and the @xmath165-coordinate of the first point hidden below the horizon @xmath202 .",
    "a simple bisection procedure is used to find the @xmath165-coordinate ( with a given latitude @xmath203 ) where @xmath24 .",
    "fifteen iterations of this bisection procedure are enough to find @xmath204 to better than @xmath205 radians when @xmath206 ( i.e.  24 longitude points ) .",
    "the corresponding angles @xmath32 are all @xmath207 .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath102 sky coordinates of the point with the surface coordinates @xmath208 are then determined .",
    "a similar procedure is done where the program steps through the @xmath163 angle for each longitude @xmath209 and @xmath210 is found from @xmath211 and @xmath212 using bisection . after the list of points on the star with @xmath24 is generated , the @xmath11 and @xmath102 rectangular coordinates of each point on the sky are converted to a @xmath179,@xmath213 polar coordinate system and sorted in the polar angle @xmath213 .",
    "the sorted array forms a convex polygon on the sky .",
    "if the number of surface elements on the star is relatively small ( @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) , then the actual horizon of the star can have some curvature between adjacent points on the polygon .",
    "since the radius @xmath179 as a function of @xmath213 is always a very smooth function , we use spline interpolation to resample @xmath179 for every @xmath216 in @xmath213 .",
    "the new resampled polygon with 360 points always has enough points so that the horizon of the star essentially has no curvature between adjacent points .",
    "we have done numerous tests and found that the horizons derived using a small number of surface elements with the new routine are always the same as the horizons found by the old routine with a very large number of surface elements ( @xmath217 and @xmath218 ) .      to compute the observed flux in a given bandpass from a star at a given phase",
    ", we numerically evaluate the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] using all of the surface elements with @xmath200 : @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the angular spacings of the elements in latitude and longitude , respectively , and where @xmath171 is the angle between the surface normal and the radius from the centre of the star . in other words , we perform a simple numerical quadrature along each latitude row where the points are equally spaced in the angle @xmath165 . if there is an eclipsing body in front of the star",
    "whose flux is being evaluated , then each point on the star in back is projected onto the sky and a simple routine is used to see if this point is inside the polygon representing the horizon of the body in front .",
    "if the point in question is eclipsed , its flux contribution is simply left out of the summation .",
    "in general , the horizon of the star in front will not pass exactly between two adjacent points on a given latitude row on the star in back . as a result there will be `` visible '' points",
    "that are actually centred in partially eclipsed surface elements and `` eclipsed '' points that are centred in partially visible surface elements .",
    "if the number of surface elements on the star in back is large enough , the contribution from the fractionally eclipsed surface elements will tend to cancel out .",
    "however , it is much more computationally efficient to use a smaller number of surface elements and make a correction for the fractionally eclipsed pixels . at each latitude row @xmath203 on the star in back ,",
    "the program determines the @xmath165-coordinate of the last point visible before the horizon of the eclipsing body @xmath201 and the @xmath165-coordinate of the first point hidden behind the horizon of the eclipsing body @xmath202 .",
    "another bisection procedure is used to determine the @xmath165-coordinate on the star in back where the horizon of the eclipsing body intersects the @xmath203 latitude row @xmath204 . if @xmath222 , then the last point visible before the horizon is centred in a partially eclipsed surface element and a negative correction is added to the flux summation : @xmath223f_{\\rm vis}\\ ] ] where @xmath224 is flux from the last visible point , i.e.@xmath225 likewise , if @xmath226 , then the first point hidden behind the horizon is centred in a partially visible surface element and a positive correction is added to the flux summation : @xmath227f_{\\rm hid}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 is the flux the eclipsed point .",
    "if there is an annular eclipse , then this procedure for finding @xmath204 may have to be done twice for a given latitude row .",
    "we have tested this simple interpolation procedure quite extensively and have found it to be quite effective .",
    "smooth light curves through eclipse can be obtained for grid sizes as small as @xmath229 and @xmath206 .",
    "we have done extensive testing of the elc code in its black body mode against the w - d code .",
    "unfortunately , there is some confusion over the notation of some of the input parameters between the two codes . in particular , @xmath230 in elc is the ratio of the star s angular velocity to the orbital velocity , whereas @xmath230 in w - d refers to the potential .",
    "the w - d @xmath230-potentials essentially define the shapes of the stars .",
    "perhaps to conserve parity , @xmath157 in elc is the `` filling factor '' which has the same function as the @xmath230-potential in w - d ( i.e.  it defines the shape of the star ) , whereas in w - d , @xmath231 is the ratio of the star s angular velocity to the orbital velocity ( elc s @xmath230 ) .",
    "the phase convention between the two codes is different . in elc ,",
    "star 1 is in front of star 2 at phase 0.0 , whereas in w - d star 1 is _ behind _ star 2 at phase 0.0 .    to facilitate comparisons between elc and w - d",
    ", we do two things .",
    "first , since the internal form of the potential is the same for both codes , elc prints out the program values of the potentials which then are the input @xmath230 potentials for w - d .",
    "second , we add a phase shift of 0.5 to the w - d light curves ( the pshift input parameter ) .",
    "we computed various model binary light curves using the two codes and compared them by normalising the light curves at phase 0.25 ( quadrature ) .",
    "we of course used exactly the same effective wavelengths , limb darkening laws and coefficients , and reflection schemes for both codes . in most cases",
    ", the light curves agreed to better than 0.1 per cent ( better than 1 millimag ) .",
    "if we compared the light curves by adjusting the normalisation of one of the curves to match the other , then the largest deviations became even smaller .",
    "finally , we compared computed geometric quantities between the two codes ( i.e.  the `` polar '' radius , `` point '' radius , etc . ) .",
    "the agreement was essentially exact .",
    "we also computed sphere - equivalent roche lobe radii and compared our results with eggleton s ( @xcite ) results and likewise found nearly exact agreement .",
