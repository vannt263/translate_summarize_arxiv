    "in addition there are hints of the higgs mass being near @xmath1gev with sm like decay widths into @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a light higgs is favored in supersymmetry although the mssm predicts a tree level upper bound on the lightest cp - even higgs mass as @xmath4 . within mssm , loop corrections can give required large corrections to higgs mass provided the stop is heavier than 1 tev or there is near maximal stop mixing .",
    "implications of the 125 gev higgs for the mssm and constrained - mssm parameter space have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "going beyond mssm , in order to get a larger tree - level higgs mass , the simplest extension is a singlet superfield in the nmssm model @xcite .",
    "the singlet interaction with the two higgs doublet of mssm is via the @xmath5 term .",
    "the higgs mass is now given by the relation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is due to radiative - correction .",
    "taking @xmath8 ( larger values would make it flow to the non - perturbative regime much below the gut scale ) and @xmath9 the radiative correction needed to get a 125 gev higgs mass is @xmath10gev which is an improvement over the @xmath11gev needed in the mssm",
    ". however fine - tuning of the stop mass is still required in nmssm to get the required higgs mass @xcite . also by extending the mssm gauge group in a suitable way",
    ", the new higgs sector dynamics can push the tree - level mass well above the tree - level mssm limit if it couples to the new gauge sector @xcite . in most of the cases",
    "the non - decoupling d - terms contribute non - trivially to increase the tree - level mass of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "recent anaysis of the susy model based on @xmath12 gauge group @xcite has shown that the tree level physical higgs mass can be atmost 110 gev and through the one - loop correction it can be raised considerably . another recent work on mssm extended by a u(1 )",
    "gauged peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite where the new d - terms can raise the tree - level mass well enough to accommodate the 125 gev higgs boson without significant radiative correction and hence requires less fine - tuning .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that with the @xmath13 triplet superfield the tree - level higgs mass can be raised to 113 gev which would still require substantial loop corrections from stops .",
    "recently , the mssm extended by two real triplets ( @xmath15 ) and one singlet@xcite has been studied with a motivation to solve the @xmath16-problem as well as to obtain a large correction to the lightest higgs mass .",
    "the analysis of the dark matter sector of this model will be complicated as the lsp will be the lightest eigenstate of the @xmath17 neutralino mass matrix which has not yet been done .    in this paper",
    "we explore the minimal extension of the mssm which can give a tree - level higgs mass of 119 - 120 gev .",

    "mass the stop mass need not be very heavy and this solves the fine - tuning problem of the higgs mass in mssm and nmssm @xcite .",
    "we also study the dark matter candidates in this model which is obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath18 neutralino mass matrix .",
    "we find a viable dark matter with mass 100 gev , which is a mixture of the higgsino and triplino ( the fermionic partner of the neutral component of the triplet higgs ) .",
    "we fix two sets of benchmark parameters at the electroweak scale which would give a the 125 gev and dark matter relic density @xmath19 compatible with wmap-7 measurements @xcite .",
    "we find that the direct detection cross section of the dark matter is @xmath20 , which is compatible with the direct detection experiments like xenon100 @xcite .    in section([model ] ) we display the superpotential of our model and we derive the scalar potential from the d - terms and f - terms and from the various soft - breaking terms . in section([higgs ] ) we give a detailed analysis of the higgs sector and we calculate the cp - even , cp - odd and charged higgs mass matrices . in section([neut ] ) , the neutralino and the chargino mass matrices are discussed .",

    "in this model , the lightest physical higgs mass at the tree - level is boosted compared to nmssm , and other triplet extended model @xcite as it gets contribution from both singlet and triplet sector([bound ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can obtain a higgs boson close to 125 gev even at the tree level . after including the leading order radiative corrections from the stop - top and triplet sector , we get @xmath123 where , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the soft masses of the stops",

    "now , the fine tuning due to the triplet sector is , @xmath132 where @xmath133 . the value of @xmath134 can be as large as 40 .",

    "for example , @xmath137 gev , @xmath138 gev and @xmath139 tev , we obtain @xmath140 .",
    "thus , we can achieve little fine - tuning compared to other models , since the lightest physical higgs mass can be large at tree level and does not require large contribution from the radiative corrections . here",
    "we note that , the higgs - triplet - higgs coupling @xmath74 ( 0.75 and 1.02 ) becomes non - perturbative at gut scale .",
    "but , these choices of @xmath74 actually helps to raise the higgs mass close to 125 gev at the tree - level .",
    "other alternative could be of course having small @xmath74 , but then we would require large radiative corrections .",
    "therefore , we improve the level of fine - tuning at the cost of giving up perturbativity of @xmath74 at gut scale .",
    "we have analyzed the neutralino sector where the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) , is a mixture of higgsino - triplino and turns out to be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "the components of @xmath141 ( for @xmath142 ) , i.e. the lsp are , @xmath143 since the lsp has mass @xmath144(100 gev ) , there are two possibilities of final states into which it can annihilate , i.e. ( i)fermion final states and ( ii)gauge boson final states . for annihilation into fermions , except",
    "@xmath145 it can go to any other @xmath146 pairs via pseudo - scalar higgs , z - boson exchange and sfermion exchange .",
    "but , if we consider the neutralino to be more like triplino , then its coupling with z - boson is forbidden .",
    "generally , it can annihilate into gauge boson pairs via several processes like chargino exchange , scalar higgs exchange and z - boson exchange .",
    "but the dominant contribution comes from annihilation into @xmath100 via chargino exchange , which finally leads to the relic density of 0.117 , consistent with wmap @xcite .    the scalar interaction between the dark matter ( i.e neutralino lsp ) and the quark is given by , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the coupling between the quark and the neutralino .",
    "the scalar cross section for the neutralino scattering off a target nucleus ( one has to sum over the proton and neutrons in the target ) is given by , @xmath149 where , @xmath150 is the reduced mass of the nucleon and @xmath151 is the neutralino coupling to proton or neutron@xcite , given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 @xcite .",

    ". the parameter @xmath158 plays a crucial role in determining the spin - independent cross - section and is highly model dependent .",
    "using this we estimate @xmath162 and the value of the spin - independent cross - section is @xmath0 , which is below the exclusion limits of xenon100@xcite and other direct detection experiments .",
    "in this paper we have explored an extension of mssm where the higgs sector is extended by a singlet and a @xmath13 triplet superfield .",
    "this is the minimal model which gives a tree level higgs mass of @xmath122(119 - 120 gev ) and the one - loop correction can easily raise it to 125 gev without significant contribution from the stop - top sector .",
    "however , @xmath136 ( at electroweak scale ) becomes non - perturbative at the gut scale , while all other couplings remain perturbative upto gut scale - on the other hand this is the price we pay to retain small fine - tuning .    in addition , we see that the triplino and singlino contributions to the neutralino mass matrix gives a viable dark matter candidate with mass around @xmath163 gev which may be seen at the lhc from the missing transverse energy signals @xcite . in mssm and",
    "nmssm the problem for getting the correct relic density of dark matter is related to the necessity of choosing chargino and scalar masses to be in the multi tev scale to fit the higgs mass from radiative corrections .",
    "the dm mass in mssm is around 700 gev while in nmssm it is possible to obtain viable dm in the 100 gev range .",
    "the main advantage of our model for the dark matter is that since the sparticle masses need not be very large compared to the electroweak scale the wimp miracle is restored and we are able to get dm mass in the 100 gev range over a large parameter space of our model .",
    "the data from lhc with integrated luminosity of @xmath164 has not only given an indication the higgs mass but there is also a measurement of the higgs decay branchings into different channels .",
    "detailed analysis @xcite of the 125 gev higgs branching fractions seen at the lhc indicates that the signal ratio for higgs decay into two photons is larger than sm prediction by a factor of @xmath165 , decay into @xmath166 and @xmath167 channels is smaller than sm by a factor of @xmath168 and into @xmath169 and @xmath170 channels it is factor @xmath171 consistent with sm .",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs ( [ higgs - frac ] ) has a sizable fraction of the singlet and the higgs decay phenomenology will be distinguishable from the mssm @xcite and likely to be similar to the nmssm scenario @xcite .",
    "but , there will be some contribution from the triplet sector too .",
    "the phenomenological aspects of the real - triplet extended sm has been studied in @xcite .",
    "more data from lhc will pinpoint or rule out the extended higgs sector models and it would be useful to study the singlet - triplet extended mssm model in greater detail with emphasis on the lhc signal in the future .",

    "<S> we study the extension of minimal supersymmetric standard model by adding one singlet and one hypercharge zero su(2 ) triplet chiral superfield . </S>",
    "<S> the triplet sector gives an additional contributions to the scalar masses and we find that the lightest cp - even higgs boson can have a mass of 119 - 120 gev at the tree level , and radiative correction raises the value to 125 gev . in this model </S>",
    "<S> no significant contributions from stop loops is needed to get the required higgs mass which alleviates the fine tuning problem of fixing the stop mass to a high precision at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> in addition this model gives a neutralino dark matter of mass around 100 gev which is a mixture of higgsino and triplino with a dark matter density consistent with wmap observations . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - independent scattering cross - section with nucleons is @xmath0 , which makes it consistent with the bounds from direct detection experiments like xenon100 and others . </S>"
