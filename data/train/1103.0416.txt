    "classical electrodynamics has been extremely successful for the past 150 years or more .",
    "however , whenever it dealt with point charged particles , the results were disappointing : a divergent electromagnetic energy , the infamous @xmath0 problem of the electromagnetic mass in the abraham  lorentz theory , and the runaway solutions of the classical lorentz ",
    "dirac equation of motion are all symptoms of a deeper maladie . in our view , there is no really satisfactory way to solve these issues entirely within the classical context .",
    "all of these problems occur in a very small length scale , in which classical electrodynamics is not supposed to work properly .",
    "therefore , any solution to these problems will have to involve contributions from processes that take place in the quantum realm .",
    "despite its impressive record , quantum electrodynamics is also plagued by the same type of problems encountered in many linear quantum theories  @xcite .",
    "in fact , any quantum theory will feature runaway solutions if its classical counterpart also have it  @xcite . again , the problem is that the introduction of point particles in a theory leads us directly into length , time , and energy scales in which strong , weak , and even gravitational phenomena are expected to play a significant role .",
    "owing to regularization and renormalization techniques , which summed up all these high energy contributions in an effective way , accurate results were achieved in quantum electrodynamics .    in the context of the quantum theory of non - relativistic electrons ,",
    "it was found that the interaction of a point electron with its own electromagnetic field induces an effective cutoff of the order of the electron reduced compton wavelength @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this cutoff owes its existence to _ zitterbewegung _ , the jittery motion caused by the never ending creation and annihilation of virtual electron ",
    "positron pairs around the point particle , effectively spreading its charge over a region of length comparable to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , classical electrodynamics is a theory valid at a length scale in which quantum phenomena are not very important , a few dozen bohr radius , for instance .",
    "however , in order to describe some of the physical phenomena that take place in a length scale comparable to the electron compton wavelength , we must extend classical electrodynamics , treating it as an effective theory in which a cutoff owes its existence to quantum phenomena at small distance . in sections",
    "[ sec : podolsky_electrodynamics ] and  [ sec : field_and_potential ] , we present a brief review of some aspects of the podolsky regularized electrodynamics in a classical context , in which a second - order derivative term that introduces a cutoff @xmath3 to the electromagnetic interaction is added to the maxwell lagrangian density in order to allow us to describe a range of phenomena in which vacuum polarization is important .",
    "classical electrodynamics is a linear theory .",
    "although interesting , attempts to formulate a nonlinear electrodynamics have not gained enough traction  @xcite . in order to preserve the linear structure of classical electrodynamics , and",
    "still allow for a cutoff @xmath3 into the theory in a lorentz and gauge invariant way , a term involving second order derivatives of the electromagnetic potential @xmath4 may be introduced in the lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field . in this case",
    ", the lagrangian density reads @xmath5 where , as usual , @xmath6 are the components of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the current .    the middle extra term was proposed long ago in an effort to regularize quantum electrodynamics  @xcite . at about the same time , a number of equivalent proposals were made  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that podolsky lagrangian is the only linear second - order gauge - invariant generalization of maxwell electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "regarding quantum electrodynamics , podolsky proposal to generalize electrodynamics is akin to pauli ",
    "villars regularization procedure  @xcite . in the pauli - villars regularization of the electron self - energy , an extra term",
    "is introduced in the lagrangian density , corresponding to a heavy auxiliary particle .",
    "the mass of this particle is related to a cutoff @xmath3 , which tames the infinities of the theory , by @xmath9 .",
    "as the cutoff goes to zero , the mass of the auxiliary particle tends to infinity and disappears from the theory .",
    "nowadays , higher order derivatives appears in attempts to regularize various gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "the good ultraviolet behavior of podolsky quantum electrodynamics comes at the cost of introducing a non - tachyonic ghost in the theory  @xcite .",
    "therefore , podolsky quantum electrodynamics may be viewed as an effective field theory as this kind of ghost may lead to non - unitary evolution in a quantum theory  @xcite . despite that ,",
    "it was pointed out that magnetic monopoles and massive photons may coexist in podolsky quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this coexistence is not ruled out by the analysis performed in finite - range electrodynamics  @xcite owing to the fact that podolsky quantum electrodynamics is a truly long - range electrodynamics with a massless excitation accompanied by a massive one .",
    "however , it may be argued that the massive photon of podolsky quantum electrodynamics is not physically sound  @xcite .",
    "however , when dealing with podolsky regularized electrodynamics as an effective theory aiming at introducing some quantum effects in a otherwise classical realm , these troubles are avoided . at the same time",
    ", we may achieve a more vivid description of the physical phenomena .",
    "in podolsky regularized classical electrodynamics , it was possible to solve the infamous @xmath0-problem  @xcite , and to eliminate runaway solutions from the lorentz ",
    "dirac equation of motion  @xcite .",
    "requiring that the correction to the hydrogen ground state energy be smaller than the relative experimental uncertainty , it was shown that the cutoff @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "hence , the cutoff length scale is well within the range of quantum phenomena such as pair creation and annihilation , and _",
    "in podolsky electrodynamics , the potential @xmath4 obeys the equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the usual dalembert differential operator .",
    "these equations for the potential lead to electromagnetic field equations @xmath13 that are of fourth order in the field @xmath7 in contrast to the usual maxwell equations . as @xmath14 are still the components of an antisymmetric tensor , bianchi identities @xmath15 still hold .",
    "we see that the regulator modifies only coulomb  gauss and ampre  maxwell laws , altering the relationship between the electromagnetic field @xmath7 and its sources @xmath8 only at small distances . in order to see that , consider a point particle at rest .",
    "it is easy to show that the electric potential @xmath16 in regularized electrodynamics tends to the usual @xmath17 at large distances @xmath18 from the particle , and to the finite @xmath19 at small distances .",
    "therefore , podolsky regularized electrodynamics alters the behavior of the field only at small distances from its source . at large distances ,",
    "we recover maxwell electrodynamics .    to see that this modification is generally effective only at small distances , we write eq .",
    "[ eq:069 ] in the lorenz gauge , @xmath20 and represent the potential @xmath21 as as a linear combination of propagating plane waves @xmath22 while the current density @xmath23 is expanded accordingly as @xmath24 it is , then , straightforward to show that @xmath25 where @xmath26 . from eq .",
    "[ eq:076 ] , we easily arrive at @xmath27 and discover that @xmath28 is reduced to the usual maxwell expression @xmath29 at large distances ( small @xmath30 ) while @xmath28 tends to a distinctive @xmath31 form , @xmath32 at small distances ( large @xmath30 ) .",
    "these results hint that the regulator also affects the free space wave propagation , allowing for the coexistence of propagating and evanescent modes even in vacuum . setting @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ eq:076 ] , we find @xmath34 as @xmath35 , we may rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq:087 ] as @xmath36 from which we can derive two different dispersion relations for the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in free space .",
    "the first dispersion relation is the familiar @xmath37 of maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "this linear dispersion relation corresponds to non - dispersive wave propagation with phase velocity @xmath38 .    the second dispersion relation",
    ", @xmath39 may be more familiar in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 if @xmath42 .",
    "[ eq:090 ] describes electromagnetic wave propagation through a colisionless plasma  @xcite with a very small attenuation length @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , from eq .",
    "[ eq:089 ] , we see that the wavenumber @xmath44 is real only if @xmath45 . otherwise , @xmath44 is a pure imaginary number , leading to evanescent wave modes as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "associated with evanescent modes . ]",
    "we can determine phase and group velocity for the dispersive modes .",
    "while phase velocity is determined by the relation @xmath46 group velocity is determined by @xmath47 as suggested by the plasma - like vacuum analogy we are pursuing , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the propagating modes , for which @xmath44 is real . on the other hand , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the evanescent modes , for which @xmath44 is imaginary .    charged particle concentration in this plasma - like vacuum is given by @xmath52 if @xmath42 . this huge particle density , corresponding to approximately @xmath53 charged particles popping in and out of existence in a sphere of radius @xmath2 , may be interpreted as the cause of the electron jittery motion induced by pair creation and annihilation .    in a quantum theory ,",
    "these results were interpreted as a sign of the existence of two excitations in podolsky electrodynamics  @xcite , corresponding to the two kinds of wave we have found : a massless photon , and a massive neutral boson with mass in the range of the @xmath54 boson  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed wave propagation in the vacuum of podolsky regularized electrodynamics , discovering two different waves : the usual non - dispersive wave with @xmath37 , and a dispersive wave with a propagating mode for high frequency ( @xmath55 ) , and an evanescent mode for low frequency ( @xmath56 ) . in a classical effective theory framework",
    ", we interpret this result as arising from a plasma - like behavior of the vacuum induced by quantum vacuum polarization . while high - energy photons ( @xmath57 ) may produce real electron - positron pairs , low - energy photons ( @xmath58 )",
    "can only yield virtual pairs .",
    "these virtual particles , living in an otherwise classical vacuum , act like a plasma , disturbing wave propagation",
    ". therefore , podolsky regularized electrodynamics inserts some features of pair creation and annihilation into the classical domain .",
    "interaction of free - space electromagnetic waves with these virtual particles is equivalent to wave propagation in an effective medium , the classical vacuum plus quantum vacuum polarization , that behaves like a plasma .",
