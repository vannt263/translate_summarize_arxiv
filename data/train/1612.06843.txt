    "double - peaked emission lines in the spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , usually observed in the permited h and he lines , are believed to originate in the outer parts of a disk , typically at about 1000 gravitational radii ( @xmath8 ) from the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of mass @xmath9 .",
    "this line - emitting region is often taken to be the outer regions of the accretion disk that extends down to a few @xmath10 . a disk origin for double - peaked emission lines",
    "was first proposed by @xcite and @xcite for the archetypical ",
    "double - peaker \" arp102b .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite found a number of other sources , confirming that a disk ( or ring ) model does reproduce the double - peaked profiles .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite for a sample of 116 agn with double - peaked balmer lines profiles selected from the sloan digital sky survey",
    ".    there have been other suggestions for the origin of double - peaked emission - line profiles . @xcite and @xcite suggested that they might be the signature of binary black holes .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a doube - peaked profile could originate in a biconical outflow , while @xcite and @xcite showed that it could be produced by an anisotropic continuum source , or , for that matter , a highly anisotropic distribution of emission - line gas .",
    "the preponderance of evidence , however , still points to a moderately to highly inclined disk - like structure @xcite .",
    "some double - peaked profiles have been monitored spectroscopically over timescales of years , at typical intervals of months .",
    "examples are the cases of 3c390.3 @xcite , which has also been monitored on reverberation timescales @xcite , ngc1097 @xcite , arp102b @xcite , as well as 14 other double - peaked emitters @xcite .",
    "these observations have revealed that the double - peaked balmer line profiles in these sources display variability on timescales ranging from months to years .",
    "the changes in the profiles are typically varying asymmetries in the blue and/or red peaks of the profiles on the _ dynamical timescale _ , associated with the rotation of the gas or patterns in the gas surrounding the smbh . in the particular case of ngc1097 , during the  30 years",
    "it has been spectroscopically monitored @xcite , the relative intensity of the blue and red peaks has alternated between a stronger blue peak and a stronger red peak on timescales of months .",
    "this beheavior has been attributed to a spiral arm rotating in the disk , with a rotation period of about @xmath018months .",
    "most of the monitoring campaigns of _ double - peakers _ reported to date were carried out using very sparse cadences , typically one observation per month or even sparser . but",
    "recent monitoring of the nucleus of ngc1097 by @xcite included a few observations at weekly intervals and showed that there are variations in the total flux of the line and in the separation between the blue and red peaks on a timescale of a week , i.e. , on the reverberation timescale . in order to search for possible shorter timescale variations , and to try to identify the driving source of the line variations , we subsequently monitored the double - peaked h@xmath11 profile in the nuclear spectrum of ngc1097 with the soar telescope and the _ swift _ satelite @xcite .",
    "these observations confirmed that the integrated flux of the line and the velocity separation betwween the blue and red peaks vary on a timescale as short as 5 days .",
    "this timescale is compatible with the light - crossing time between the center of the disk and a typical radius of @xmath12 , where the emission line originates , according to our models .",
    "the variability timescale of @xmath13days , observed in ngc1097 is of the order of the delays found between the variations of the continuum and broad emission lines in reverberation mapping studies of nearby seyfert 1 galaxies of comparable luminosity .",
    "this indicates that the line - emitting disk in ngc1097 is at a distance from the ionizing source that is typical of the broad - line region ( blr ) of nearby seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that many seyfert 1 galaxies show , at least on some occasions , evidence for an underlying disk - like component .",
    "double peaks or `` shoulders '' are frequently seen in the balmer - line profiles of highly variable and closely monitored sources like ngc5548 @xcite .",
    "these various observations lead one to consider the possibility that the balmer - line profiles in all seyfert 1 galaxies have a disk - like component that could be identified with the outer parts of an accretion disk .",
    "a simple hypothesis might be that balmer - line profiles in seyfert 1 galaxies are a composite of : ( 1 ) a disk - like component , as seen clearly in the spectra of double - peaked emitters , and ( 2 ) another component originating in clouds that are not in the disk , e.g. in a wind component or in orbits farther out .    a model of a disk component plus",
    "another narrower broad component to reproduce the broad balmer line profiles of seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars has been previously proposed by @xcite and collaborators @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical study by @xcite also argues that the broad - line region of seyfert 1 galaxies has two parts : a disk and a system of clouds that are part of an outflowing disk wind . as the eddington ratio drops ,",
    "the high column density gas , which resides largely in the disk , dominates the emission and leads to double - peaked line profiles .",
    "a disk - wind component would be expected to be stronger at higher eddington ratios , so this might naturally account for the relative prominence of the disk - like component in lower luminosity agns ( llagns ) and the relative difficulty of identifying the disk component in more luminous , higher eddington ratio objects .    in this contribution we study the spectra of all seyfert1 galaxies of the palomar spectroscopic survey @xcite  selected for being an homogeneus and representative sample of galaxy nuclear spectra in the near universe  to show that we can identify disk - like structures in the balmer - line profiles of many of them .",
    "an underlying disk - like component can account for much of the structure and asymmetries seen in seyfert1 line profiles , and , combined with another narrower component , attributable to other emitting clouds , can reproduce most of the broad - line profiles .",
    "thus , our primary goal is to demonstrate the plausibility of the idea that the broad balmer line profiles of this sample seyfert 1 galaxies can be described well by a combination of a disk - like component and a somewhat narrower , bell - shaped component . as the palomar sample is a carefully selected local sample , designed to find the lowest luminosity agns , we also use our results to obtain statistics of the presence of the disk component , and discuss the implications for the calculation of the mass of the smbhs in type 1 agn .",
    "this is our secondary goal .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the disk model that we have used to reproduce the double - peaked profiles of the low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) in ngc1097 and other sources . in secs . 3 and 4 we use this model to reproduce the double - peaked h@xmath11 profiles of llagn and seyfert1 galaxies of the palomar survey and show the need for an additional broad gaussian component in most cases . in sec . 5 , we show how the profile shape changes as a function of inclination relative to the plane of the sky .",
    "we use these results and the frequency of occurrence of the double - peaked profiles in the palomar sample to draw inferences about the presence of disk emission in type 1 agn . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the implications of our findings for the determination of smbh masses in type 1 agn , and in sec .",
    "7 we present our conclusions .",
    "we use the model described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , assuming that the broad double - peaked emission line originates in the outer parts of a relativistic keplerian disk of gas surrounding the smbh .",
    "the line - emitting portion of the disk is circular and located between an inner radius @xmath14 and and an outer radius of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the disk radius in units of the gravitational radius @xmath17 .",
    "the plane of the disk has an inclination @xmath18 relative to the plane of the sky ( i.e. , zero degrees corresponds to a disk observed face - on ) .",
    "superimposed on the axisymmetric emissivity of the circular disk , there is a perturbation in the form of a spiral arm .",
    "the corresponding emissivity law is given by @xmath19 \\right .",
    "+ \\frac{a}{2 } \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{4 \\ln2}{\\delta^{2 } } ( 2\\pi - \\phi + \\psi_{0})^{2 } \\right ] \\right \\},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the axisymmetric emissivity of the disk .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the radius of maximum emissivity , or saturation radius , at which the emissivity reaches a maximum and changes behavior : @xmath22 is the index of the emissivity law for @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the index for @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the brightness contrast between the spiral arm and the underlying disk , and the expression between square brackets represents the decay of the emissivity of the arm as a function of the azimuthal distance @xmath27 from the ridge line to both sides of the arm , assumed to be a gaussian function with @xmath28 ( azimuthal width ) .",
    "the relation between the azimuthal angle @xmath29 and the angular position @xmath30 of the ridge of emissivity of the spiral arm is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the azimuthal angle of the spiral pattern , @xmath33 is the pitch angle , and @xmath34 is the innermost radius of the spiral arm .    the specific intensity from each location in the disk , in the frame of the emitting particle is calculated as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the emission frequency and @xmath37 is the rest frequency corresponding to h@xmath38 and @xmath39 is the local `` broadening parameter '' @xcite .",

    "although previous studies  as those mentioned above  have focused on fitting the broadest and cleanest double - peaked profiles , many nearby seyfert1 nuclei also show broad balmer lines with double peaks or shoulders .",
    "this can be observed , for example , in the nuclear spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies which have been the subject of spectroscopic monitoring campaigns , such as ngc4151 @xcite , ngc5548 @xcite , ngc3227 @xcite and ngc3516 @xcite . @xcite",

    "either the h@xmath49 profiles are double - peaked or the root - mean - square residual @xmath50 spectra are double - peaked .",
    "this indicates that , even if the profile is not clearly double - peaked ( e.g. due to the presence of other components ) , the most variable part of the profile is double - peaked , supporting the idea that the innermost part of the blr ( that varies most , as it is closer to the ionizing source ) is a disk .",
    "we show in fig.[n3227 ] the result of our attempt to fit the @xmath50 h@xmath49 profile of ngc3227 using our disk model and data from @xcite : although the profiles are not always double - peaked , the @xmath50 spectrum is .",

    "fig.[n3227 ] shows that the model does fit the double - peaked component although there is , in addition , an even broader component , revealed by the extended red wing that could not be fitted by our model .",

    ". of the total sample of 486 galaxies , the nuclear spectra of 211 have been classified as agn , with 46 among them classified as of type 1 .",

    "the fit of the line profiles in these  probable \" cases shows that the broad component is not well constrained and may be due instead to complex kinematics of the narrow - line region ( hereafter nlr ) .",
    "we have inspected the h@xmath11 profiles in the palomar spectra of the 34 nuclei considered to present definite detection of a broad h@xmath11 line , and searched in the literature for previous studies with analysis of these profiles .",
    "we list in the top part of table[sy1_tab ] the 12 galaxies that show clearly double - peaked or flat - topped h@xmath11 profiles , giving in the last column of the table the reference in which the profile is shown to be double - peaked ( or disk - like ) .",

    "the higher angular resolution of the _ hst _ spectroscopy allows the detection of even fainter lines than those detected in the palomar survey as the contribution of the stellar population decreases even further in the narrower stis slits ( @xmath52 ) .    in order to further support our argument that broad double - peaked profiles are frequently found in type 1 agn , we list in the bottom part of table[sy1_tab ] six additional seyfert 1 galaxies with broad double - peaked or disk - like balmer - line profiles that are not in the palomar survey ( most of them being southern objects ) , but are type 1 agn at distances similar to to those of the palomar galaxies",

    "when we compare this number with the 20% fraction above for type 1 agn , we conclude that @xmath156% of type 1 agn should have double - peaked balmer - line profiles . according to these predictions ,",

    "we find 12 , thus @xmath158% instead of the predicted 60% . on the other hand , the number we have found may be a lower limit , as , in some cases the double - peaked nature of the line profiles could be observed only in very high - quality _ hst _ stis spectra in which the contrast between the emission lines and the host - galaxy starlight is much higher than in the palomar spectra .",
    "in addition , in the small apperture of the stis spectra , the nlr contribution can also be minimized , increasing the contrast between the blr and nlr emission . as not all the type 1 agn of the palomar sample",

    "stis , this fraction of 35% double - peakers may be a lower limit .",

    "this fraction , obtained from @xcite , is listed in the fifth column of table[sy1_tab ] .",
    "the total number of these sources from @xcite is 14 , with 9 ( 64% ) of them having double - peaked profiles , now consistent with the @xmath060% prediction above .",
    "another possibility is that the ratio of the outer to inner radius of the disk is @xmath159 , what would make the line profiles singly - peaked ( see figure  9 of * ? ? ?",

    "as mentioned in section 1 , the fact that broad - line profiles of seyfert 1 and radio galaxies seem to contain a flattened component has been noted in previous studies , including also those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have performed detailed dynamical modeling of the blr of five seyfert1 nuclei .",
    "the main conclusion of @xcite is that the blr geometry is a thick disk viewed close to face - on , in agreement with our findings .",
    "they argue also for the presence of inflows that could be due to the motion of blr clouds in elliptical orbits around the smbh @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the gaussian component represents perturbations in the surface brightness of the disk that are not captured by the single spiral arm we have adopted .    on the basis of this and",
    "previous studies we suggest that the disk is present in most blrs , and at the higher eddington ratios of seyfert 1 galaxies , we observe additional line - emitting components corresponding to non - disk clouds , usually at lower velocities .",
    "some of these clouds may be inflowing @xcite , just orbiting the smbh in elliptical orbits as proposed by @xcite , or may be part of an outflowing disk wind @xcite .",
    "the technique of reverberation mapping has provided valuable tools for the estimation of the mass of smbhs in agn up to very large distances in the universe , solely on the basis of the observed continuum luminosity and width of the broad emission lines .",
    "the optical luminosity allows the estimate of the blr radius @xcite , while the width of the broad profile provides the velocity dispersion of the blr clouds @xmath160 .",
    "assuming that the motion of the blr gas is dominated by gravity and that radiation pressure can be neglected , the mass of the central black hole is given by @xcite    @xmath161    where @xmath162 is the radius of the blr , @xmath163 is the gravitational constant and @xmath2 is a dimensionless numerical factor that depends on the structure , kinematics and orientation of the blr .",
    "a recent empirical determination of the average scale factor is @xmath164 @xcite , based on the assumption that the relationship between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion is the same for quiescent and active galaxies .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is of fundamental importance in using equation [ eq : mass ] for the determination of the masses of smbh s across the universe , and incorporates the uncertainties due to the geometry and inclination of the blr .",
    "the recognition that the disk component may be ubiquitous in type 1 agn has important implications for the value of @xmath2 in the cases dominated by the disk component .",
    "if we consider that the geometry of the region that varies on the shortest timescale probed by the profile variation is a flat disk , @xmath4 , where @xmath18 is the inclination of the disk relative to the plane of the sky , as the observed width of the lines @xmath160 is simply the rotational speed projected into the line - of - sight .",
    "in particular , for @xmath165 , @xmath166 , which is practically the same as the median value that we obtain from the data in table[two_components ] , of @xmath167 .",
    "similar disk inclinations have also been reported from the fit of disk models to double - peaked profiles in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the fact that the majority of disks are observed with inclinations between 20@xmath46 and 37@xmath46 is supported also by predictions of the simple model : if we consider that the maximum opening angle of the torus is @xmath168 , then the fraction of type 1 agn observed with inclinations between 20@xmath46 and 37% should be @xmath080% , while only @xmath020% should be observed with inclinations smaller than 20@xmath46 .",
    "this seems to be the case of ngc5273 for which we obtain @xmath169 , and of ngc3227 , for which we fit the rms profile and obtain an inclination of @xmath170 .",

    "our model implies @xmath4 for the disk component .",
    "the facts that : ( 1 ) the parameters of the disk , and in particular , their inner , outer and saturation radii do not vary much among different type 1 agn ( @xmath030% , see table[two_components ] ) ; and ( 2 ) that the width ( fwhm ) of the line strongly depends on the inclination of the disk ( see fig.[dp_profiles ] ) imply that there should be a relation between the fwhm of the broad profiles and @xmath2 .     and the fwhm ( kms@xmath1 ) of the broad line according to our average model ( see last column of table[two_components ] ) , represented by black dots for inclinations in the range @xmath176 , and for the broad profiles of the type 1 agn of table[two_components ] plus ngc1097 from table[n1097_table ] .",

    "we have called this model  average model \" .",
    "we have then varied the inclination @xmath18 between 10@xmath46 and 50@xmath46 , to build a sequence of models as a function of @xmath18 . for each model we measured the value of the fwhm ( in kms@xmath1 ) and plotted @xmath2 as a function of fwhm in fig.[f_vs_fw ] as black circles .",
    "we have then fitted the relation between these two quantities with the function :    @xmath177    this relation is shown as a red line in fig.[f_vs_fw ] .",
    "we have also included in fig.[f_vs_fw ] the values obtained from the fit of the profiles of the 5 galaxies in table[two_components ] plus that of ngc1097 in table[n1097_table ] , shown as colored circles .",
    "the error bars correspond to the uncertainties in the inclinations listed in table[two_components ] and in the fwhm values .",
    "the latter uncertainties were obtained as follows . while the listed fwhm values were obtained considering as maximum flux the average between the peak fluxes of red and blue peaks or shoulders , the maximum fwhm value was adopted as corresponding to a maximum flux equal to the flux of the lower peak and the minimum fwhm value as corresponding to a maximum flux equal do the flux of the higher peak .",
    "fig.[f_vs_fw ] shows that the measured fwhm values follow the relation given by equation [ eq : regression ] within the uncertainties .",
    "lower values of fwhm correspond to low disk inclinations , for which it is important to consider the thickness of the disk . for a ratio between a half thickness @xmath178 and disk radius @xmath179 ,",
    "@xmath2 becomes @xcite :    @xmath180    although this expression ensures that the value of @xmath2 will not diverge for low inclinations , we have checked that , for a typical value of @xmath181 @xcite , the decrease in the value of @xmath2 by including the term @xmath182 is at most @xmath183 for the range of inclinations we are considering ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the grey band in fig.[f_vs_fw ] comprises the range of the model values corresponding to the root - mean - square variations of the parameter values listed in the last column of table[two_components ] .",
    "the variations of the regression parameters of equation   [ eq : regression ] allow the coverage of the grey band in fig.[f_vs_fw ] .",
    "equation   [ eq : regression ] implies that , approximately , @xmath185 .",
    "we note that equation   [ eq : mass ] is also consistent with this relation if the ratio @xmath186 is constant .",
    "our modeling , in which the profile shape depends on the inner , outer and maximum emissivity radia in units of gravitational radia imply exactly this : that the profile shape depends only on the ratio between the disk radia and the smbh mass and that this ratio seems to be approximately constant .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 does not depend much on the ratio @xmath186 is supported also by the following argument . from equation [ eq : mass ]",
    "we have :    @xmath187    and we also know that @xmath188 and that @xmath189 . the eddington ratio is defined as @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "so @xmath192 .",
    "therefore    @xmath193    and    @xmath194    thus , even for varying smbh masses and accretion rates , the dependence of @xmath2 on these properties is weak , and , as a result , @xmath2 depends mostly on the width of the profile : @xmath195 or @xmath196 .      it has been argued that the broad double - peaked balmer lines in llagn and radio galaxies originate in the outer parts of an accretion disk that is ionized by an ion torus @xcite or other radiatively inefficient structure @xcite .",
    "such structure develops when the mass accretion rate to the smbh drops below some minimum eddington ratio , of order @xmath197% , which is the case of llagn .",
    "llagn and seyfert 1 nuclei have been compared to the two states observed in x - ray binaries @xcite : the low - luminosity hard state and the more luminous soft state ( or thermal state ) , respectively .",
    "the thermal state is the one dominated by the geometrically thin , optically thick disk , analogous to more lumious agns ( seyfert galaxies and quasars ) where the uv / optical emission is dominated by the `` big blue bump '' ( bbb ) from the accretion disk .",
    "the low - luminosity hard state is characterized by a harder x - ray spectrum and much lower thermal emission from the thin disk , and this is consistent with the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of llagn , which lacks the bbb component .",
    "the fact that the double - peaked profiles are observed both in llagn and in seyfert 1 galaxies suggest that the inner structure of the low - luminosity and high - luminosity agn are not very different .",
    "the disk component seems to be always present . in llagn ,",
    "the disk emission is the only component seen , while in more luminous type 1 sources , such as seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars , additional broad - line component that , since the velocity dispersion is smaller , probably originates in more distant clouds than the gas that produces the disk component .",
    "this is also supported by rm studies  the fact the double - peaked characteristic pops out in the rms spectrum , which shows only variable emission on rm time scales , suggests the lower - velocity gas  filling - in \" the peak is either optically thin to the continuum or else at a larger distance , where geometrical damping of the short time - scale rm variations occurs ( much like the nlr ) .",
    "the observation of the non - disk clouds leading to the additional broad component can be understood as due to the higher luminosity of the source ; at higher accretion rates there should be more gas clouds in the vicinity of the nucleus , either inflowing or originating from an accretion disk wind that gets enhanced with increased accretion rates .",
    "we have used previously published results as well as fits of broad h@xmath11 profiles in the spectra of nearby active type 1 nuclei from the palomar survey of nearby galaxies to argue that disk - like emission - line profiles ",
    "double - peaked profiles originating in the outer parts of an accretion disk , at @xmath01000 schwarzdchild radii  are ubiquitous in the blr of these objects .",
    "we have shown that while  pure \" disk profiles are seen mostly in llagn , in seyfert 1 galaxies the profiles usually present an additional narrower component ( fwhm@xmath010003000kms@xmath1 ) well fitted with a gaussian function .",
    "we attribute this component to non - disk blr gas , usually moving at lower velocities .",
    "our results support previous studies arguing that , while for llagn the accretion rate is low and most accreting gas is confined to the disk , for the higher accretion rates that occur in seyfert galaxies , one can also observe lower velocity ionized gas that is orbiting the smbh farther from the disk , in inflow towards the disk or being ejected in a wind from the disk .",
    "the disk component  being closer to the ionizing source  should be the most variable part of the profile , and indeed many reverberation mapping studies show that the @xmath50 spectrum reveals a double - peaked profile .    while previous studies have already argued that the blr is dominated by a flattened component , our study  via the fit of a disk component to the blr profiles  has allowed us to obtain the parameters of the disk , such as the inner and outer radii and the maximum emissivity radius in units of gravitational radii .",
    "we have found that these parameters do not vary by more than 30% among the different sources , which leads to the conclusion that the main parameter that regulates the width of the double - peaked profile is the inclination of the disk relative to the plane of the sky .    in the cases for which the blr emission is dominated by the disk component ,",
    "the factor @xmath2 in the formula used to calculate the smbh mass @xmath198 should be @xmath4 .",
    "the median inclination of the sources fitted with the disk model in our study , @xmath5 , corresponds to @xmath6 , very close to the most recent value of @xmath199 @xcite , obtained in a completely independent way .",
    "but the range of inclinations we obtained , @xmath200 implies that the @xmath2 factors range between @xmath02.6 and @xmath012 .",
    "thus , for the lowest inclinations ( narrower profiles ) , the smbh masses obtained using a fixed value of @xmath2 are understimated by a factor of @xmath2013 .",
    "having concluded that the main paramenter regulating the width of the blr profiles  in the disk - dominated cases  is the inclination of the disk , our study has further allowed us to propose a relation ( equation [ eq : regression ] ) between the value of @xmath2 and the fwhm of the broad profiles that could lead to an improvement in the determination of smbh masses in disk - dominated agns .",

    "<S> broad ( @xmath010,000kms@xmath1 ) , double - peaked emission - line profiles of balmer lines emitted by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to originate in the outer parts of an accretion disk surrounding a nuclear supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , at @xmath01000 gravitational radii and are most frequently observed in the nuclear spectra of low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) and radio - galaxies . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we argue that broad double - peaked profiles are present also in the spectra of other type 1 agn , such as seyfert 1 galaxies , suggesting that the inner part of the broad - line region ( blr ) is also the outer part of the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we use the palomar spectral survey of nearby galaxies to show that the only difference between seyfert 1 blr line profiles and  bona fide \" double peakers is that , in most cases , besides a disk component , we need an additional gaussian component attributed to non - disk clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the recognition that the inner and most variable part of the blr has a disk geometry suggests that the factor @xmath2 in the expression to obtain the smbh mass in type 1 agn @xmath3 is @xmath4 for the disk dominated sources . our median @xmath5 implies @xmath6 , very close to the most recent value of @xmath7 , obtained from independent studies . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a relation between @xmath2 and the fwhm of the broad profile that may help to reduce the uncertainties in the smbh mass determinations of agn . </S>"
