    "one of the currently most debated questions concerning the structure of the x - ray luminous , hot intracluster plasma of clusters of galaxies is the consequence of the small cooling time of this plasma in those clusters with dense central cores ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) .",
    "xmm - newton x - ray spectroscopy has shown that in spite of its short cooling time the gas is not cooling at the high expected rates in the absence of heating processes ( e.g. peterson 2001 , 2003 ; matsushita et al .",
    "2002 ; bhringer et al . 2002 ; molendi 2002 ) .",
    "the most popular scenario which allows for a self - regulated heating of the hot plasma in cluster cooling cores and prevents massive cooling is the heating of the intracluster medium ( icm ) by the jets and radio lobes of the agn in the central cluster galaxies ( e.g. churazov et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; david et al .",
    "2001 ; fabian 2003 ; forman et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it was shown that this interaction provides enough power in many nearby cooling flows to at least balance cooling .",
    "for example the current kinetic energy output of the inner radio lobes in m87 in virgo and ngc 1275 in the perseus cluster is with estimated values of @xmath12 erg s@xmath4 and @xmath13 erg s@xmath4 , respectively , in both these cases about an order of magnitude higher than the cooling power in the cooling core ( churazov et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ; birzan et al .",
    "recently further very deep and detailed x - ray observations have given some insight into the details of the heating process , which is proposed to occur through the dissipation of sound waves set off by the interaction of the radio lobes with the icm @xcite or by shock fronts ( forman et al .",
    "2004 , nulsen et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b , mcnamara et al",
    "a promising picture seems to be emerging where the recycling of agn energy with powers in the order of @xmath14 to @xmath15 erg s@xmath4 in cluster cooling cores of nearby clusters could explain the observed phenomena .    searching through larger volumes of our universe",
    ", more extreme cases of cluster cooling cores can be found , where the rate of agn energy recycling is even higher by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the cluster with the largest cooling core detected so far , rxcj1347.5 - 1144 at z=0.4516 was discovered in the reflex survey @xcite with a formally derived cooling flow mass deposition rate of the order of 3000 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 ( for a hubble constant of @xmath16 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ; schindler et al .",
    "1997 ; allen 2000 ) which corresponds to an energy dissipation of @xmath17 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this cluster is unfortunately much more distant than the well studied nearby clusters and does not lend itself easily to a detailed observational study .",
    "we have now discovered a more nearby , similarly striking massive cooling core cluster in the reflex survey , rxcj1504.1 - 0248 at a redshift of @xmath18 .",
    "this cluster was flagged as a cluster candidate due to a galaxy overdensity detected in the cosmos data base @xcite and six concordant galaxy redshifts found in our subsequent follow - up observations confirmed the existence of a cluster .",
    "three of these cluster galaxies show agn - like spectra .",
    "serious doubts remained about the cluster identification of this x - ray emitter , because the x - ray source appeared much too compact for its high luminosity , compared to the other clusters in the reflex sample in the same distance and luminosity range .",
    "this could possibly be attributed to a contaminating central agn .",
    "the certain identification clearly required a higher resolution x - ray observation , which could recently be made through a chandra snap - shot exposure yielding a perfect cluster image without significant contamination by point sources ( fig.1 ) . with these source properties",
    "it becomes immediately clear that rxcj1504.1 - 0248 must have an extremely bright core and is potentially a very interesting cooling core cluster .",
    "in this paper we study the structure of this cluster in more detail . in section 2 and 3",
    "we present the observational results .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the modeling of the mass profile and the determination of the parameters in the frame of a classical cooling flow model . in section 5",
    "we discuss further phenomenological features related to the cooling core of the cluster and section 6 provides the conclusion .",
    "we will adopt a cosmological model with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , except if it is noted otherwise .",
    "thus 1 arcmin at the distance of rxcj1504 - 0248 corresponds to 209 kpc .",
    "rxcj1504.1 - 0248 was observed with the chandra acis - i on january 7 , 2004 for 13463 sec .",
    "the observation was hardly disturbed by times of high background and the net exposure after standard cleaning procedures is 13 298 sec .",
    "2 shows an image of the cluster in the 0.5 - 2 kev energy band superposed on an optical r - band image taken as 5 min exposure in our reflex redshift survey at the eso la silla 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the total acis - i count rate in the region @xmath22 arcmin in the 0.5 to 2 kev band is 2.03 cts s@xmath4 implying an unabsorbed flux of about @xmath23 and @xmath24 erg s@xmath4 @xmath25 in the @xmath26 kev and @xmath27 kev energy bands , respectively . in the rosat all - sky survey we found a flux of @xmath28 erg s@xmath4 @xmath25 in the @xmath27 kev band within an aperture of 12 arcmin radius , in reasonable agreement with the new results from the much deeper image .",
    "the x - ray cluster center coincides well with a central dominant galaxy that can be identified with lcrs b150131.5 - 023636 at the j2000 position 15 04 07.5 -02 48 16 at z=0.216917 ( shechtman et al .",
    "the optical image of the cluster and the spectrum of the galaxy b150131.5 - 023636 described in section 5 have been obtained with efosc2 at the 3.6 m telescope of eso la silla on aug .",
    "14 and 20 , 2001 , respectively .",
    "the above noted fluxes imply an x - ray luminosity of @xmath29 erg s@xmath4 in the @xmath27 kev band and a bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath30 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this makes this cluster the most prominent x - ray luminous cluster in the southern sky at redshifts below @xmath31 , with only two galaxy clusters at larger distances in the reflex catalogue having a higher x - ray luminosity . the x - ray image in fig .",
    "1 shows a high degree of regularity with a slightly elliptical shape and a major axis approximately along a position angle of about 40 degrees ( north to east ) . as seen in fig .",
    "2 the center of the x - ray emission is marked by a dominant giant galaxy in the optical .",
    "the azimuthally averaged x - ray surface brightness profile from which the background was subtracted is well described by a @xmath0-model out to a radius of about 300 arcsec , outside which the background subtraction uncertainties become significant ( fig .",
    "the background was estimated either from the outer region of the ccd or from an external background field .",
    "remarkable is the small core radius of @xmath32 kpc and the high central gas density of @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the slope parameter , @xmath0 , has the very typical value of @xmath35 .",
    "the temperature profile was determined by fitting a spectral mekal model with fixed galactic absorption with a column density of @xmath36 @xmath25 ( as measured from 21 cm observations , dickey & lockman 1990 ) to the spectra obtained from the photons extracted from concentric rings around the cluster center .",
    "the background for subtraction was taken either from a background region at the outer parts of the detector ( radial zone 3.8 to 5.7 arcmin ) or from a background field in the same rings as taken for the target spectral extraction .",
    "since there is some faint x - ray emission from the cluster almost throughout the entire detector , the on - target background subtraction prevents an accurate temperature determination at larger radii .",
    "fig 4 provides a comparison of both methods , showing that the two approaches yield practically identical results out to a radius of 1 arcmin , but the analysis based on an external background field can be extended to a radius of 3 arcmin . while the bulk temperature of the cluster is about 10.5 kev , we note a strong temperature drop towards the center to a value below 5 kev . such a temperature drop by a factor of 2 or 3 is observed in many cooling core clusters ( e.g. de grandi & molendi 2002 ; fabian 2003 ; ikebe et al .",
    "2004 ; sanders et al .",
    "a possible temperature drop to larger radii indicated by the data can not be established with the present photon statistics .",
    "5 shows the spectrum of the innermost circle ( 0 - 15 arcsec ) . for the given photon statistics the spectrum is well fit by a one - temperature mekal model .",
    "we do not note any features which could indicate the fe l line complex observed at lower temperatures , which would indicate the presence of cooler temperature phases .    in fig .",
    "4 we show 3 rough fits of analytic expressions to the temperature profile which were chosen to approximately bracket the inner and outer gradients of the temperature profile .",
    "the analytical expressions are :    @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 )    2.5 cm and @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 )    @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 )    2.5 cm and @xmath43 ( for @xmath44 )    @xmath45 ( for @xmath38 )    2.5 cm and @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 )    where the radius , r , is in units of arcsec .",
    "the spectral fits also indicate abundances of heavy elements ( dominated by the fit to the fe k line ) of about 0.3 to 0.4 solar with large errors of about 0.1 to 0.2 in solar units ( abundances based on anders & grevesse 1989 ) . to our surprise",
    "we do not find a strong increase of the iron abundance towards the center , as seen in many cooling flow clusters ( degrandi & molendi 2001 ) , but a deeper observation is necessary to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "from an analytical deprojection of the @xmath0-model fit to the x - ray surface brightness profile of the cluster and the temperature profile we can obtain the cluster mass profile under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry .",
    "the resulting mass profile is shown in fig . 6",
    "together with the profile of the gas mass , as derived from the @xmath0-model fit . for the gravitational mass profile",
    "we also indicate the typical uncertainties determined from the local minima and maxima of the mass profile for the different analytical temperature fits shown in fig .",
    "4 . an additional scaling uncertainty of 15% for @xmath48 and @xmath49 and 5% for @xmath50 is included . at a radius of @xmath51",
    "mpc the total mass is @xmath52  m@xmath6 . for the radius @xmath53 mpc",
    "we find a mass of @xmath54  m@xmath6 .",
    "thus rxcj1504 - 0248 is among the most massive clusters known . the gas - to - total mass ratio for the two fiducial radii is @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "to gain an understanding of the processes occuring in the central icm of this cluster we start with a classical cooling flow analysis ( e.g. fabian et al . 1984 ; thomas et al .",
    "we take two approaches . for the more simple model",
    "a we equate the energy loss by radiation inside a given radius , @xmath57 , with the enthalpy influx from outside through the sphere with radius @xmath57 . in model",
    "b we formulate the energy balance in a local differential way and include the gain of gravitational energy of the material flowing in from the outer regions .",
    "@xmath58    where @xmath59 is the cooling function normalized to the electron density squared , @xmath60 is the shell width in the numerical calculation , @xmath61 is the gravitational potential , and the other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "7 shows the cooling time as a function of the cluster radius . if we take the often used fiducial value of @xmath62 years , we find a cooling radius of @xmath63 kpc ( for a hubble constant of @xmath64 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath65 ) and @xmath66 kpc ( for @xmath67 ) . here",
    "the uncertainty is determined from the minima and maxima for the different adopted fits to the temperature profile .",
    "8 then shows the mass flow rates determined for model a and b and the cooling radius is indicated by vertical lines . for this",
    "adopted cooling radius we find mass flow rates of 1400 and 1900 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 ( for @xmath68 ) and 2300 and 2930 ( for @xmath67 ) for model b and a , respectively .",
    "these high formal cooling flow mass deposition rates make rxcj1504 - 0248 the most prominent cooling flow cluster next to the most luminous cluster known , rxcj1347 - 1144 at @xmath69 for which also a mass deposition rate of the order of 3000 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 ( for @xmath67 ) was deduced ( schindler et al . 1997 ; allen 2000 ) .",
    "this makes rxcj1504 - 0248 a very interesting target to study the cooling core phenomenon under the most extreme conditions .",
    "in the new scenario of the physics of cooling core clusters , the large radiative cooling rates are compensated by the energy released from a central agn ( e.g. churazov et al . 2000 , 2001 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; david et al .",
    "2001 ; bhringer et al . 2002",
    "; fabian 2003 ; forman et al . 2004 ) . to keep the balance such that neither massive mass condensation nor a dispersion of the dense gaseous core occurs",
    ", the heating has to be fine - tuned .",
    "this is achieved by a self - regulation system where large mass deposition rates in the center lead to an increased feedback from the agn which limits the cooling rate .",
    "seen from the perspective of the central agn , its accretion rate is limited by the amount of cooling that can occur , that is the energy that can be dissipated by the icm in the cooling core region ( churazov et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this cooling core scenario",
    "a high radiative power of the central icm indicates a fast accretion of the interacting agn .",
    "the case of rxcj1504 - 0248 is an extreme case in this scenario .",
    "since the core radius is so small , actually much smaller than the cooling radius by a factor of about four , the major part of the total x - ray luminosity ( about 72% ) originates from inside the cooling radius .",
    "this corresponds to a total radiation power of @xmath70 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "so far we have no direct indication that this cooling rate is balanced by agn heating in this system . some support for this scenario",
    "is discussed below .",
    "assuming that the above sketched cooling core scenario applies and that the observed cooling power inside the cooling radius is balanced by the energy output from the agn we can calculate further interesting system parameters . if the radiation power is replenished by accretion power from the agn and if we assume an energy return efficiency , @xmath71 from accretion onto the agn black hole we can imply an accretion rate of the order of @xmath72 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 .",
    "thus , in this mode the central black hole can gain a considerable mass of the order of the most massive black holes known over cosmic times .",
    "therefore it is very interesting to see if this scenario actually applies to rxcj1504 - 0248 .",
    "so far the observational evidence is far less detailed as for the best observed nearby cooling core clusters and the implications indicated above remain very speculative .",
    "but the few additional features known , point in the right direction .",
    "the central dominant galaxy is known to harbor a radio source with a brightness of 62 mjy at 1.4 ghz ( bauer et al .",
    "2000 ) and thus it presumably contains a massive black hole .",
    "the radio source image obtained from the nvss survey is , however , unresolved and featureless . a zoom into the central region of the chandra image ( fig .",
    "9 ) shows indications of an asymmetric distortion which could be due to the interaction of the agn jets with the intracluster medium .",
    "better photon statistics is needed to draw a more firm conclusion .",
    "therefore deeper x - ray observations have been scheduled for chandra and a detailed vla radio study has been proposed for this cluster .",
    "the central dominant galaxy is extremely large .",
    "the gunn r magnitude of 16.4 determined in the las campanas redshift survey ( shechtman et al .",
    "1996 ) translates into an absolute magnitude of @xmath73 which corresponds to about @xmath74 l@xmath6 in this band .",
    "it places this galaxy in the upper few percent of the luminosity distribution of cluster central galaxies as found for example by comparison to the survey by lauer and postman ( 1994 ) .    the optical spectrum of the central galaxy , shown in fig .",
    "10 , shows narrow , low excitation emission lines , notably strong [ o ii ] , weaker [ o iii ] , and bright h@xmath75/[nii ] lines , similar to what has been observed for many massive cooling flows ( e.g. hu , cowie & wang 1985 ; johnstone , fabian & nulsen 1987 , heckman et al .",
    "1989 , donahue , stocke & gioia 1989 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ; crawford et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this provides another hint that this cluster resembles a scaled - up version of the known nearby cooling core clusters .",
    "a very similar spectrum has been observed and studied in detail in the central galaxy of the cooling core galaxy cluster a2597 by voit & donahue ( 1997 ) . in the spectrum of a2597",
    "the [ oii ] line is even more dominant compared to the other lines .",
    "voit & donahue provide a very comprehensive discussion on the origin of this spectrum .",
    "they conclude that hot stars constitute the best fitting source of ionization , but to match the spectral properties with an photoionization nebular model an additional heat source has to be assumed which may well be the heating source of the cooling core .",
    "the same discussion most probably applies also to this object , but to perform the same analysis a deeper spectroscopic observation is required to get accurate line fluxes for more diagnostic lines .",
    "very similar spectra can also be found among the spectra compiled from central cluster galaxies by crawford et al .",
    "it is very striking that the spectra which best match the spectrum of rxcj1504 - 0248 are those from the prominent well known cooling flow clusters , such as z3146 , a1835 , a2204 , and a2390 .",
    "overall these spectra show some variation in the degree of ionization with [ oii ] and [ oi ] lines being more prominent compared to [ oiii ] in z3146 and [ oiii ] being relatively more prominent in a2390 than in the present case .",
    "but the close resemblance is very obvious . within the classification scheme of agn",
    "the present observation features as a liner spectrum .",
    "the equivalent width of the [ oii ] line is about @xmath76  corresponding to a line flux of about @xmath77 erg s@xmath4 @xmath25 .",
    "together with the total luminosity of the galaxy and the relation of [ oii ] luminosity and star formation rate as given by kennicutt ( 1992 ) we get formally a star formation rate of the order of about 50 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is not untypical for a massive cooling core cluster ( e.g. mcnamara 1997 ) . since there are surely other ionization sources present , this simple modeling is certainly an oversimplification .",
    "the chandra observation reveals the x - ray source rxcj1504 - 0248 as a galaxy cluster that has extreme and surprising properties in two respects .",
    "it is found to be a very massive cluster and the most luminous cluster known in the southern sky at redshifts lower than @xmath78 .",
    "secondly , the cluster appears extremely compact with a very dense central region .",
    "thus the high x - ray luminosity is the result of both , the large cluster mass and the high central density .",
    "these properties would make the cluster a cooling flow with one of the largest mass deposition rates ever inferred .",
    "but the observation of a radio agn in the cluster center and the absence of low temperature signatures in the central x - ray spectrum leads us to suspect that the dense central icm region is heated by the agn like it is implied from the x - ray observations for nearby clusters .",
    "the heating source required in rxcj1504 - 0248 needs to have a power about an order of magnitude larger than that of the nearby well studied cooling core clusters .",
    "this extreme energy recycling will surely make rxcj1504 - 0248 a very interesting study object for many future investigations .",
    "this x - ray source has been accepted for observations with astro - e2 which should for example provide insight into the degree of turbulence prevailing in the cooling core region ."
