    "classical plasma theories , which describe plasmas as collections of charged classical particles moving in self - consistent electromagnetic ( em ) fields , become deficient when relativistic and quantum effects are important .",
    "the conditions at which relativistic quantum effects are important may be determined by comparing three energy scales : the energy scales of the plasmas , the energy scales of the em fields , and the rest energy of charged particles .",
    "the energy scales of plasmas are the thermal energy @xmath0 , the fermi energy @xmath1 , and the plasmon energy @xmath2 .",
    "the energy scales of wave fields are the photon energy @xmath3 and the ponderomotive energy @xmath4 .",
    "the energy scales of static electric and magnetic fields are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "relativistic effects are important when the energy scales of either the plasmas or the em fields are comparable to the rest energy of charged particles .",
    "quantum effects are important when the thermal energy is low compared to other energy scales .",
    "an example where relativistic quantum effects are important is the magnetosphere of an x - ray pulsar @xcite .",
    "the typical magnetic fields of x - ray pulsars are on the order @xmath7 g. the corresponding magnetic energy @xmath8 kev is comparable to the rest energy of electrons @xmath9 kev , indicating that relativistic effects are important .",
    "moreover , the effective temperature of x - ray pulsars @xmath10 kev is colder than @xmath11 , indicating that quantum effects are also important .",
    "that relativistic quantum effects are important , an inference made by comparing energy scales , is strongly supported by anharmonic cyclotron absorption features observed in spectra of x - ray pulsars @xcite . since classical plasma theories",
    "can not explain these spectral features , the presence of high order harmonics is attributed to inelastic scatterings of photons with electrons that occupy quantized landau levels @xcite , and the anharmonicity is attributed to viewing geometry as well as relativistic effects @xcite . despite numerous efforts , many features of cyclotron absorption lines remain to be explained @xcite .",
    "the locations and shapes of these lines contain important information such as the magnetic field and plasma profiles of magnetospheres of x - ray pulsars .",
    "this information can not be extracted , unless wave dispersion relations , which enter the radiation transport equations @xcite that serve as the forward model in the retrieval problem @xcite , are obtained for strongly magnetized plasmas . in this paper , we will obtain , for the first time , explicit expressions of wave dispersion relations in strongly magnetized plasmas .",
    "another example where relativistic quantum effects are important is a plasma produced by ultra intense lasers interacting with a solid target . during the interaction , a quasistatic magnetic field on gigagauss scale",
    "can be produced @xcite .",
    "the corresponding magnetic energy @xmath12 kev is comparable to the electron temperature of the plasma , indicating that quantum effects are important .",
    "relativistic effects also turn out to be important when optical lasers are used to diagnose the plasma .",
    "this is because the frequencies of optical photons are close to wave cutoffs , if the plasma has density @xmath13 , corresponding to @xmath14 ev .",
    "due to singularities near cutoffs , small modifications of the cutoff frequencies can have large effects .",
    "such effects have been revealed in a number of experiments @xcite . in these experiments , it is found that the magnetic field , determined from classical formulas , is larger when the same plasma is diagnosed by lasers with higher frequencies .",
    "this peculiar dependence of the inferred magnetic field strength on the frequencies of diagnostic lasers indicates that systematic errors exist in classical formulas .",
    "these systematic errors can be removed only by carefully calculating how waves propagate in strongly magnetized plasmas . in this paper",
    ", we will describe , for the first time , how faraday rotation is modified by relativistic quantum effects .    to describe wave propagation in strongly magnetized plasmas , as well as in other plasmas where relativistic quantum effects are important",
    ", we develop a general theory that can be applied to various situations .",
    "the general theory , which is based on the concept of effective action in quantum field theory , describes wave propagation through possibly nonthermal scalar qed plasmas in background em fields .",
    "the wave effective action has a clear physical meaning .",
    "when waves propagate through plasmas , they interact with charged particles , whose dynamics are affected by the presence of the background fields as well as the wave fields .",
    "after all the interactions related to charged particles are summed up , what remains is the effective action of waves .",
    "this clear physical picture of the wave effective action can be translated into rigorous mathematical procedures .",
    "to derive the effective action , we start from the standard action of scalar qed , self - consistently factor out the background fields from the fluctuating fields , and then integrate out the charged particle fields in the path integral perturbatively .",
    "we shall see that at the 1-loop level , the effective action is related to the linear response of the system to small amplitude waves .",
    "having developed the general theory , we demonstrate how it can be applied using two examples .",
    "the first example is a uniform , unmagnetized , boson plasma .",
    "such a system has been studied by a number of authors using other methods @xcite .",
    "results of our general theory agree with these authors in this special case .",
    "the second example is a uniform , magnetized , boson plasma .",
    "such a system has been studied by witte and coauthors @xcite , who can only describe wave propagation parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "our results agree in this special case .",
    "moreover , our transparent formalism also enables us to describe nonparallel wave propagation , which was obscure in previous studies .",
    "although many theories and models have been developed in the literature to describe waves in relativistic quantum plasmas , such as plasma response theories @xcite , finite temperature theories @xcite , quantum hydrodynamic models @xcite , and models that are based on the historical heisenberg - euler effective lagrangian @xcite , this is the first theory capable of demonstrating its correctness by showing that all linear wave modes well - known in classical plasma theories can be recovered when taking the classical limit , where @xmath15 is the rest mass , @xmath16 is the momentum , and @xmath17 is the quantized energy of a particle . ] in relativistic quantum results .    beyond the immediate goal of establishing a formalism that describes wave propagation in relativistic quantum plasmas , the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that quantum field theory , in whose language the standard model of particle physics",
    "is written , and in whose language many phenomena in condensed matter physics are explained , is also an effective language for plasma physics .",
    "since particle physics describes a few particles with high energy , condensed matter physics describes many particles with low energy , and plasma physics describes intermediate number of particles with intermediate energy , it should not be surprising that a language that is effective for both extremes is also effective in the intermediate regime . in this paper",
    ", we study scalar qed , which describes spin-0 bosons , instead of spinor qed , which describes spin-1/2 fermions , so that our main ideas can be illustrated without complications due to spins .",
    "although plasmas are typically made of spinor particles instead of scalar particles , scalar qed can be a good model for many condensed matter systems like superconductors and superfluids @xcite .",
    "moreover , our scalar qed plasma theory does recover waves in classical plasma theories , which typically take no account of spins at all .",
    "extension of our formalism to spinor qed plasmas is straightforward and will be reported separately .",

    "our starting point is the standard action of scalar qed , in which a complex scalar field is coupled to the gauge field through minimum coupling . in natural unit @xmath18 and minkowski metric @xmath19 ,",
    "the standard scalar qed action is @xmath20 the complex scalar field @xmath21 , whose complex conjugate is denoted as @xmath22 , describes charged spin-0 bosons with mass @xmath15 and charge is a dimensionless small number related to the fine - structure constant @xmath23 .",
    "we denote @xmath24 the charge of particle states of species @xmath25 , so the charge of anti - particle states is @xmath26 . ]",
    "the real - valued 1-form @xmath28 is the gauge field that defines the gauge covariant derivative @xmath29 .",

    "to 1-loop level , @xmath32 does not contribute to the propagation of gauge bosons .",
    "for simplicity , we set the renormalized value of @xmath32 to zero from now on .",
    "it is well - known that the lagrangian density of action ( [ eq : action ] ) is invariant under local u(1)-gauge transformation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is any function .",
    "the gauge invariant symmetry current is @xmath35.\\ ] ] contributions by other charged species are additive to the current as well as to the lagrangian .",
    "for conciseness , we will not write summations over charged species explicitly .    to describe plasmas , which are constituted of charged particles and their self - consistent em fields ,",
    "let us first understand the roles of background fields in quantum field theory .",
    "in the usual quantum field theory , fields fluctuate near their vacuum expectation values .",
    "the creation and annihilation of energy momentum quanta are always accompanied by the creation and annihilation of particles .",
    "however , when fields fluctuate near some non - vacuum backgrounds , these two types of fluctuations become orthogonal .",
    "energy momentum quanta can be created and annihilated without changing the number of particles in a system , and the number of particles can be altered without changing the total energy and momentum of the system .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : background ] .",
    "mathematically , the fields @xmath21 and @xmath36 can be decomposed into classical backgrounds and quantum fluctuations @xmath37 vacuum is the trivial case when the background fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 are zero .",
    "when the background fields are nontrivial , the self - consistency of the classical backgrounds is given by the euler@xmath40lagrange equations @xmath41 in the above equations , @xmath42 is the background gauge covariant derivative , @xmath43 is the background field strength tensor , and @xmath44 is the total background current , summed over all charged species .",
    "it is clear that the above equations are invariant under the background u(1)-gauge transformation on @xmath45 and @xmath39 .",
    "the classical equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) describe bound states as well as unbound states .",
    "when the potential energy is larger than the kinetic energy , as is the case in condensed matter systems , particles are bound by the potential created by other particles . in this case , the wave functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are localized and interactions between particles can be strong . on the other hand , when the kinetic energy is larger than the potential energy , as is the case in plasmas , particles are unbound . in this case , the motion of one particle is weakly correlated with the motion of other particles , except during collisions .",
    "fluctuates near the vacuum ( a ) , energy and momentum fluctuations are always accompanied by density fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "when the field fluctuates near some non - vacuum background ( b ) , energy and momentum fluctuations can be orthogonal to density fluctuations.,width=321 ]    while the background em field @xmath46 is conceptually simple , the background charged particle field @xmath38 needs some clarifications .",
    "when the plasma background is constituted of n bosons , the classical background field @xmath47 is formally related to the properly symmetrized n - body wave function @xmath48 by @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the volume form of the @xmath51 dimensional subspace space of the n - boson configuration space . the half - form @xmath52 is commonly seen in geometric quantization @xcite .",

    "when a pair @xmath56 appears in an expression , two half - forms combine into the volume form , and the integration can then be carried out .",

    "having clarified the roles of background fields , let us study their effects in quantum field theory .",
    "separate classical backgrounds from quantum fluctuations using decomposition ( [ expand ] ) , integrate by part using @xmath63 and cancel terms using the background self - consistency conditions ( [ eom ] ) , we can write action ( [ eq : action ] ) as @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the field strength tensor for the fluctuating field @xmath66 , @xmath67 are currents due to vacuum excitation and background plasma excitation , respectively .",
    "the background - reduced action ( [ reducedaction ] ) is associated with a lagrangian density @xmath68 that depends on the fluctuating fields @xmath69 and @xmath66 .",

    "the background charged particle field @xmath45 , which is self - consistent with @xmath46 , can also be regarded as fixed . in this way ,",

    "similarly , @xmath73 is the lagrangian density of the free @xmath66 field .",
    "notice that the background field @xmath38 endows the gauge field @xmath66 with a mass term that can have spatial and temporal dependences .",
