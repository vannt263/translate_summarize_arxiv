    "we present preliminary results from a new class of hydrodynamical models for the formation of single elliptical galaxies ( pipino , dercole , & matteucci , 2007 ) in which we implement detailed prescriptions for the chemical evolution of h , he , o and fe .",
    "our aims are : i ) to test and improve our previous predictions of an outside - in formation for the majority of ellipticals in the context of the supernovae - driven wind scenario , by means of a careful study of gas inflows / outflows ; ii ) to explain the observed slopes , either positive or negative , in the radial gradient of the mean stellar [ @xmath0/fe ] , and their apparent lack of any correlation with all the other observables ( melhert et al .",
    "2003 ; annibali et al . 2006 ; sanchez - blazquez et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we adopted a one - dimensional hydrodynamical model which follows the time evolution of the density of mass , momentum and internal energy of a galaxy , under the assumption of spherical symmetry . in order to solve the equation of hydrodynamics with source term we made use of an improved version of the bedogni & dercole ( 1986 ) eulerian , second - order , upwind integration scheme .",
    "our main novelty , in fact , is that we follow the chemical evolution of several elements , namely h , he , o and fe .",
    "this set of elements is good enough to characterize our simulated elliptical galaxy from the chemical evolution point of view .",
    "in fact , as shown by the time - delay model ( matteucci & greggio 1986 ) , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is a powerful estimator of the duration of the star formation .",
    "all the models run undergo an outside - in formation as suggested by pipino , matteucci , & chiappini ( 2006 ) , in the sense that star formation stops earlier in the outermost than in the innermost regions , owing to the onset of a galactic wind .",
    "we find that the predicted variety of the gradients in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio can be explained by physical processes , generally not taken into account in simple chemical evolution models , such as metal  enhanced radial flows coupled with different initial conditions .",
    "once transformed into predictions on the line - strenght indices , these gradients in the abundaces lead to @xmath1 mag per decade in radius , again in agreement with the typical mean values measured for ellipticals by several authors and confirming the pipino et al .",
    "( 2006 ) best model predictions .",
    "the remarkable exception of some model with a steeper gradient seems to go in the direction of a few massive objects in the ogando et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample .    by analysing typical massive ellipticals",
    ", we find that all the models that show values for their chemical properties , including the [ @xmath2 and the total metallicity gradients , within the observed ranges , show a variety of gradient in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio , either positive or negative , and one as no gradient at all .",
