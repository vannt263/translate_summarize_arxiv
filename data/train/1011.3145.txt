    "the relativistic vlasov - poisson ( rvp ) system is given by @xmath0 @xmath1 models a system with repulsive interaction while @xmath2 models a system with attractive interaction .",
    "one of the earliest papers to appear on the subject is @xcite wherein glassey and schaeffer show that global classical solutions to @xmath3 will exist for initial data that are spherically symmetric , compactly supported in momentum space , vanish on characteristics with vanishing angular momentum , and have @xmath4-norm below a critical constant @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 recently , kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh @xcite have extended the theorem of glassey and schaeffer for rvp@xmath8 by proving global existence of classical solutions for the same type of initial data except that they only need to have @xmath9-norm below a critical constant @xmath10 with @xmath11 and identically zero for @xmath12 the sharp value of this constant was subsequently determined for all values of @xmath13 in @xcite .",
    "glassey and schaeffer also investigated what may happen when rvp@xmath8 is launched by initial data with @xmath14 .",
    "they proved that negative energy data lead to  blow - up \" in finite time . in the same paper extending the global existence result , kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh proved that any spherically symmetric classical solution of rvp@xmath8 launched by initial data @xmath15 with _ zero total energy _ and total virial less than or equal to -1/2 will blow up in finite time . specifically , with the total energy of @xmath16 given by @xmath17 and the virial of @xmath16 given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , theorem 6.1 of @xcite states :    let @xmath20 be a spherically symmetric classical solution of rvp@xmath8 over some interval @xmath21 launched by initial data @xmath16 with @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , then @xmath25    the proof is by contradiction .",
    "the zero - energy condition ensures that the virial is strictly decreasing . assuming that an initial datum satisfying the requirements above launches a global solution",
    ", one can show ( using a number of technical estimates ) that a strictly positive quantity is bounded above by a sum of positive terms and a time integral of the virial .",
    "the authors then show that after a sufficiently long time this strictly positive quantity is bounded above by something negative .",
    "hence , such an initial datum can not lead to global existence in time .",
    "now , the authors of @xcite did not give any specific examples of favorable initial data , and recently the question was raised whether such data actually exist @xcite .",
    "indeed , nearly uniform balls of material centered at the origin ( the simplest ansatz one could conceive ) can not be made to work .",
    "surprisingly , the existence of these initial data is an interesting , non - trivial question ! the purpose of this brief note is to settle this issue .",
    "we first define a generic separation of variables ansatz and derive all basic formulae needed to carry out our subsequent investigations .",
    "we then show that the simplest ansatz ( a nearly uniform ball of material centered at the origin ) can not have the desired properties .",
    "next , we employ a disjoint core - halo structure ( a central ball of material with a separate thin ring of material further out ) to construct a class of initial data satisfying the requirements in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we show that zero - energy initial data can have arbitrarily negative virial .",
    "the success of the core - halo scheme raises the question of whether such a disjoint structure is necessary for our requirements .",
    "we answer this in the negative by exhibiting a second class of initial data with zero total energy and total virial less than or equal to -1/2 that have the nice properties of being monotonically decreasing and  singly supported . \"    we should mention that the details of the blow - up scenario are not addressed in either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite lemou , mhats , and raphal proved that  blow - up \" for systems launched by initial data with negative total energy approaches a self - similar collapse .",
    "lastly , we also mention other recent results on @xmath26 .",
    "hadi and rein @xcite showed the non - linear stability of a wide family of steady - state solutions of @xmath26 against a class of perturbations utilizing energy - casimir functionals . shortly thereafter ,",
    "lemou , mhats , and raphal @xcite investigated non - linear stability versus the formation of singularities in @xmath26 through concentration compactness techniques . while these results are interesting in their own right , they will play no role in the following considerations .",
    "we first establish the various formulae we shall need for our particular class of functions . consider a generic separation - of - variables ansatz : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( both considered as vectors in @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are non - negative .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 will be chosen to normalize the total mass to @xmath35 .",
    "the total mass is given by @xmath36 using the notation @xmath37 and recalling that all functions under consideration are non - negative we see that taking @xmath38 will ensure that @xmath39 has total mass 1 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath40-norm is given by @xmath41    recalling the definition of the virial functional from the introduction , for our separation of variables gives @xmath42 of course , in order to have a negative virial we must require @xmath43    for the energy ( as given by ) , we compute the  kinetic \" and potential energy contributions separately ( the portion of the energy we label as  kinetic \" also contains the rest mass energy ) .",
    "for the kinetic energy , we have @xmath44    we begin computing the potential energy by first computing the spatial distribution @xmath45 associated to @xmath39 : @xmath46 in terms of this function , the potential energy contribution is now given by @xmath47 we calculate this integral directly , and after a little work find @xmath48",
    "at this point , we can show that the simplest ansatz can not work . relaxing the differentiability requirement for a moment",
    ", we make the specific choices @xmath49}(|q| ) , \\\\",
    "\\phi(|p| ) & = & \\chi_{[0,p]}(|p| ) , \\\\",
    "\\mathscr{l}(x ) & = & \\chi_{[-1,a]}(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath52 .",
    "we have that @xmath53    the zero - energy requirement allows us to solve for @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 . calculating the virial and plugging in the formula for @xmath56 gives @xmath57 in terms of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath58 .",
    "simple asymptotics shows that for this ansatz @xmath59 for any choice of parameters . smoothing out the boundaries of these step functions ( taking care to keep the total energy zero )",
    "shows that this ansatz is untenable . of course",
    ", this type of initial condition may well lead to collapse after finite time , but this can not be verified by our virial condition .",
    "the failure of nearly uniform balls to satisfy our criteria is a little surprising at first , but upon reflection we can understand the difficulty . recall that the ",
    "kinetic \" energy term contains the rest mass contribution and so is at least one ( in our rationalized units ) .",
    "heuristically , this forces the radius of the ball of mass to be small in order to have the potential energy negative enough to balance the  kinetic \" energy contribution .",
    "this has severe consequences for the virial - which is made smaller in magnitude by concentrating all the matter near the origin .",
    "the considerations at the end of the previous section lead us to try a disjoint core - halo scheme : @xmath60}(|q| ) + \\alpha\\chi_{[r_2,r_3]}(|q| ) , \\label{sp1}\\\\ \\phi(|p| ) & = & \\chi_{[0,p]}(|p| ) , \\label{sp2}\\\\ \\mathscr{l}(x ) & = & \\chi_{[-1,a]}(x ) \\label{sp3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "again , we have relaxed the differentiability requirement to make the computations tractable .",
    "the idea behind this ansatz is that putting a tiny halo of material far from the center should increase the magnitude of the virial while keeping the potential energy negative enough to maintain zero total energy for the system .",
    "we first consider the specific choices @xmath63 the zero energy condition forces ( thanks to maple ) @xmath64 ( a small but positive number ) .",
    "again by maple , choosing @xmath65 gives @xmath66 since our ansatz is compactly supported , we have the requisite number of moments . to complete the argument",
    ", we note that we can smooth out the various step functions in such a way that the resulting integrals are as close to the values obtained above as we like .",
    "since @xmath67 was chosen to force the zero - energy condition and the necessary value was strictly positive , it follows that by smoothing the test functions appropriately we can still choose an @xmath68 to keep the total energy zero . using maple to check",
    "the @xmath40-norm for the range of @xmath58 listed above shows that our data are well above the critical norm @xmath69 thus , we have constructed an initial datum satisfying all the requirements of theorem 6.1 in @xcite .",
    "considering the lower bound on the virial for nearly uniform balls , the reader may wonder whether a similar phenomenon holds for the disjoint core - halo structure .",
    "we give an argument showing that the virial can be made arbitrarily negative in this case .",
    "we make the following choices in ( [ sp1 ] ) : @xmath70 now , the zero energy condition allows us to solve for @xmath71 . using maple for convenience , one sees that as a function of @xmath55 , @xmath67 is positive for sufficiently large @xmath55 and is proportional to @xmath72 as @xmath73 . plugging these choices into the formula for the virial and looking at the asymptotics for large @xmath55 shows that the virial is proportional to @xmath74 . smoothing these functions out as above shows that the virial is unbounded below . as before",
    ", the @xmath40-norm for these functions remains well above the critical norm for a wide range of values of the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "having established the existence of initial data satisfying the theorem of kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh , we are technically done .",
    "however , we can ask whether the separation of the halo from the core is an absolute necessity .",
    "the answer is no .",
    "even though nearly uniform balls ( after regularization ) were shown not to work , we can find zero - energy initial data with virial less than @xmath75 that are monotonically decreasing and supported in a ball centered at the origin .",
    "as in the previous section , we describe initial data that are not smooth with the understanding that we can appropriately regularize our functions without significantly altering any of the required properties .",
    "we now consider the ansatz @xmath60}(|q| ) + \\left(\\frac{r_1}{|q|}\\right)^n\\chi_{[r_1,r_2]}(|q| ) + \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^n\\chi_{[r_2,r_3]}(|q| ) , \\label{sp4}\\\\ \\phi(|p| ) & = & \\chi_{[0,p]}(|p| ) , \\label{sp5}\\\\ \\mathscr{l}(x ) & = & \\chi_{[-1,a]}(x ) .",
    "\\label{sp6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we have kept the same choices for the momentum and angular portions of @xmath39 but substituted a spatial portion that is monotonically decreasing inside the ball of radius @xmath76 centered at the origin and zero outside this ball . a representative diagram for @xmath77",
    "is given in figure [ fig3 ] below .",
    "note that it retains the essential ingredient from the previous section .",
    "namely , there is a dense ball of material centered about the origin ( to sufficiently lower the potential energy ) surrounded by a thin atmosphere of material further out ( to sufficiently increase the magnitude of the virial ) .    , title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    even with this relatively simple ansatz ,",
    "the calculations are unwieldy .",
    "thanks again to maple , we merely report a choice of parameters that does the job .",
    "namely , choosing @xmath78 sets a corresponding @xmath55 ( about @xmath79 ) to force the zero - energy condition . finally , any choice of @xmath58 less than roughly @xmath80 gives us a virial less than @xmath75 .",
    "a check of the @xmath40-norm shows that it is well above the critical value .",
    "we remark that our choice of parameters was totally arbitrary , and so we expect that an entire range of such parameters will do the job .",
    "however , here we are content merely with the existence of one such solution !",
