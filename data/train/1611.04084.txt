    "<S> cosmological equations were recently derived by padmanabhan from the expansion of cosmic space due to the difference between the degrees of freedom on the surface and in the bulk in a region of space . in this study , </S>",
    "<S> a modified rnyi entropy is applied to padmanabhan s ` holographic equipartition law ' , by regarding the bekenstein  hawking entropy as a nonextensive tsallis entropy and using a logarithmic formula of the original rnyi entropy . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the acceleration equation including an extra driving term can be derived in a homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> when a specific condition is mathematically satisfied , the extra driving term is found to be constant - like as if it is a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the order of the constant - like term is naturally consistent with the order of the cosmological constant measured by observations because , without tuning , the specific condition constrains the value of the constant - like term . </S>",
    "<S> the present model should provide new insights into both alternative dark energy and the cosmological constant problem . </S>"
