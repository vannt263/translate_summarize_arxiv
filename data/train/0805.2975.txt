    "electron - positron annihilation at high energies leads to the creation of quark - antiquark pairs with high momenta . assuming that neither quark in a given event radiates an energetic gluon , the quark and the antiquark fragment into two jets of hadrons in opposite hemispheres .",
    "the energies and the momentum vectors of the quarks can be inferred from the energies and momenta of the observed final state hadrons .",
    "the quark - hadron fragmentation process is usually parameterized with the help of fragmentation functions @xmath2 .",
    "these describe number densities for a quark of flavor @xmath3 to fragment into a hadron @xmath4 carrying the fraction @xmath5 of the original quark momentum .",
    "the two final state quarks can be created in transverse spin states .",
    "here we use azimuthal correlations between pairs of hadrons in opposite jet hemispheres to study transverse spin effects in the quark fragmentation process . specifically , we study the distribution of final state pions around the momentum vector of the fragmenting quark .",
    "the quark momentum direction is measured approximately by identifying it with the thrust axis .",
    "spin - dependent effects in the fragmentation of quarks into hadrons were first discussed by collins @xcite : the collins function @xmath6 is the amplitude of the modulation in the azimuthal distribution of the final state hadrons in spin - dependent fragmentation processes .",
    "it depends on the normalized hadron momentum @xmath5 and the magnitude of the transverse hadron momentum @xmath7 with respect to the three momentum of the quark .",
    "initial efforts to extract collins asymmetries in @xmath0 annihilation were carried out in delphi @xcite .",
    "the first observation of the azimuthal collins asymmetries in quark fragmentation was reported by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "this paper is an extension of the earlier belle measurement with nearly a factor of 20 higher statistics allowing a more refined analysis .",
    "the collins function can not be calculated reliably employing qcd based algorithms , because the fragmentation process is a non - perturbative process . however , once determined experimentally the collins effect can be used as  quark spin polarimeter \" to determine the transverse spin states of final state quarks in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and in polarized proton - proton scattering . over the past few years",
    "there has been increasing interest in spin phenomena and experiments have published new data on the transverse spin structure of the nucleon @xcite . however , the semi - inclusive observables in sidis are not a direct measurement of the transverse quark spin distributions ( the so - called transversity distributions ) . instead they measure a product of quark transversity distributions and the collins fragmentation functions .",
    "only an independent measurement of the collins asymmetry in @xmath0 annihilation makes it possible to extract transversity quark distributions from single transverse spin asymmetries in sidis or polarized proton - proton scattering .",
    "recently , the first global transversity analysis of sidis and belle data has been carried out by anselmino and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark",
    "transversity distributions have large errors that are dominated by the experimental uncertainties in the sidis and belle data .",
    "the new results presented here in combination with new data expected in the near future from hermes and compass will reduce the uncertainties in the extraction of quark transversity distributions .",
    "the study of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) fragmentation and distribution functions such as the collins fragmentation function has led to important theoretical developments in qcd and have greatly advanced the understanding of factorization and process dependence of distribution- and fragmentation - functions in hard scattering processes .",
    "tmd hard quark scattering can give rise to the large single spin asymmetries that have been observed experimentally but seemed to be incompatible with the traditional hard scattering qcd framework , which assumes factorization @xcite .",
    "specifically , factorization assumes that the exchange of soft gluons in the initial or final state of a hard scattering process can be neglected .",
    "furthermore it is assumed that parton distributions and fragmentation functions are process - independent , i.e. that the collins function in sidis will be the same as in @xmath0 .",
    "it has now become possible to correctly include the initial and final state interactions in qcd calculations for some hard scattering processes .",
    "recent calculations @xcite with the correct treatment of initial and final state interactions in hard processes show that the sivers effect @xcite arises from this inclusion .",
    "another consequence of this new treatment of factorization is the process dependence of the sivers distribution function . while the sivers distributions in sidis and the drell - yan process are expected to have the same magnitude they are predicted to have opposite signs .",
    "collins fragmentation appears to be an important test case for future theoretical approaches that describe low energy qcd phenomena .",
    "the collins function describes phenomenologically the evolution into hadrons starting from a quark with a given momentum and spin orientation .",
    "the challenge for the future will be to calculate this process from basic principles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a discussion of the collins effect the experimental procedure will be described in detail , a detector description is followed by a description of the analysis and the study of systematic errors .",
    "finally , results will be presented together with an attempt to interpret the measured collins asymmetries for di - hadrons in terms of the collins fragmentation functions .",
    "recently there has been an increased interest in the third leading twist quark distribution function of the nucleon , the so - called transversity distribution @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding charge is the tensor charge , which is obtained by summing the charge - squared weighted transverse spin distribution over all flavors , integrated over the quarks momentum fraction @xmath11 . due to its symmetry properties",
    "this is a more valence - like object than the axial charge ( which is obtained in a similar way from the quark helicity distribution ) .",
    "since the transversity distribution function is chiral - odd , gluons can not contribute at leading order .",
    "therefore no gluon transversity distribution exists and thus the qcd evolution of transversity is different from that of the quark helicities .",
    "transversity can not be accessed with inclusive dis experiments , since the corresponding forward scattering amplitude contains a helicity flip that is suppressed by the nearly vanishing quark mass relative to the scale @xmath12 .",
    "the scale in dis is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the four - momentum transfer from the lepton to the nucleon .    as a consequence one can only measure transversity if a second chiral - odd distribution or fragmentation function is involved .",
    "one possibility to measure transversity uses drell - yan processes , via double spin asymmetries of two transversely polarized proton and ( anti)proton beams .",
    "this yields information on the product of a quark and an antiquark transversity distribution .",
    "unfortunately the cross section for this process is quite small and the possibility of reasonably high transverse polarizations for antiprotons is limited although some efforts are being made to conduct such experiments in the future @xcite .",
    "another way to access transversity is by combining it with a chiral - odd quark fragmentation function .",
    "this combination is available in semi - inclusive dis off a transversely polarized nucleon by detecting at least one of the produced hadrons .",
    "such measurements are currently being performed at hermes @xcite on a proton and at compass @xcite on a deuteron target .",
    "in addition , a very similar observable can be accessed in proton - proton collisions where one of the beams is transversely polarized . in both cases",
    "there are different candidates for chiral - odd fragmentation functions , which are briefly discussed in the following three paragraphs .",
    "+      most relevant to the interpretation of existing data on experiments with transversely polarized targets or beams is the collins function first proposed in ref .",
    "the collins function relates the transverse spin of the quark to the transverse momentum of a final state hadron .",
    "these correlations result in a non - uniform azimuthal distribution of final state hadrons around the initial quark direction .",
    "the interference fragmentation function @xcite measures the interference of two hadrons in the final state between two different angular momentum states . this interference is again visible as an azimuthal asymmetry of the plane defined by the two hadrons around the original quark momentum .",
    "according to model predictions @xcite the interference fragmentation function may be different from zero whenever the invariant mass of the hadron pair is close to the mass of resonances .",
    "examples are the @xmath15 for pion pairs and the @xmath16 for kaon pairs .",
    "another possibility is polarimetry of @xmath17 baryons produced in fragmentation @xcite . here",
    "the relevant fragmentation function describes the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into a transversely polarized @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17-polarization can be inferred experimentally from the kinematics of the decay .",
    "+ these three spin - dependent fragmentation processes can be used to obtain transversity quark distributions @xcite . however , in all three cases the experimental observables depend on transversity distributions folded with a currently unknown spin analyzing fragmentation function .",
    "therefore transversity functions can not be extracted from polarized semi - inclusive measurements alone , and an independent measurement of the fragmentation functions is required . in this paper",
    "we discuss a measurement of collins asymmetries performed at the kekb @xmath0 collider with the belle detector .",
    "extraction of transversity distributions through a combined analysis of transverse spin asymmetries from semi - inclusive polarized dis and collins fragmentation data from @xmath0 requires the universality of the collins fragmentation function between @xmath0 and deep inelastic scattering . at the present time universality",
    "has been confirmed only at leading order by collins and metz @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the measurement of the collins effect in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the collins fragmentation function describes the creation of hadrons with transverse momentum @xmath18 from a transversely polarized quark with polarization @xmath19 and momentum @xmath20 . following the trento convention @xcite the number density for finding a hadron @xmath4 produced from a transversely polarized quark @xmath3",

    "it changes sign when the quark spin is flipped and thus generates a single spin asymmetry .",

    "the transverse polarization vector of the quarks serves as a reference axis for the azimuthal asymmetries of single spin distributions . in @xmath0 with unpolarized beams no such reference direction exists .",
    "an analysis of collins asymmetries in single jets in @xmath0 therefore will yield a zero result as the cosine modulation will average to zero in a large event sample .",
    "this observation will later be used for important tests of the analysis algorithm and possible false asymmetries resulting from detector effects ( section [ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "the collins effect can therefore only be observed in the combination of two functions each one creating a single spin asymmetry .",
    "the correlation of quark and antiquark collins functions in opposite hemispheres gives a product of two @xmath25 modulations for the two azimuthal angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 , resulting in a @xmath28 modulation ( see fig .  [ angle2 ] ) .",

    "the method already mentioned in the previous subsection translates the definition of the collins function ( eq .  [ eq : cdef ] ) into the @xmath39 case , where the initial momentum of the quark - antiquark pair is known .",

    "the thrust value varies between 0.5 for spherical events and 1 for tracks aligned with the thrust axis of an event .",
    "the thrust axis is a good approximation to the original quark - antiquark axis as described in section [ sec : eventsel ] .",
