    "the large - scale spatial distribution of galaxies is an important topic for modern cosmology .",
    "the cosmic structure as revealed by the observed galaxy spatial distribution is believed to originate from primordial density fluctuations .",
    "gravitation amplifies these fluctuations and is the main driver for the formation and evolution of the cosmic structures . in the current popular scenario ,",
    "galaxies form inside the previously collapsed `` dark '' gravitational wells in a process joined and modified by gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and photonization .",
    "the coalescence of these dark halos brings galaxies together and to merge in a hierarchical manner .",
    "the large - scale distribution of the galaxies can be characterized by various statistical and topological methods . in particular , the 2-point correlation function has been extensively used .",
    "it measures the second moment of the probability distribution , and statistically completely describes a gaussian density field , which is believed to represent the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "however , the density field smoothed over the observed galaxy spatial distribution is highly non - gaussian .",
    "the evolved cosmic structure as probed by galaxy distribution contains highly dense regions crowded by galaxies delineating spatial voids where few galaxies are located .",
    "we generally need the probability distribution function , or its moments , to completely characterize such galaxy distribution in space . a counts - in - cells method has been used to establish the galaxy probability distribution function .",
    "theory @xcite and models @xcite have been developed to interpret the probability distribution .",
    "a multifractal description for galaxy spatial distribution has been studied both theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite , and applied to several galaxy samples @xcite .",
    "in particular , borgani ( 1993 ) studied the multifractal behavior of various hierarchical probability distribution functions and derived the behavior of multifractal dimensions for extreme underdense and overdense regions .",
    "indeed , the geometrical concepts of fractal and multifractal are appealing given the ubiquitous presence of such structures in various natural and social phenomena @xcite .",
    "less - well - perceived has been the statistical origin of multifractals as characterizing the moments of a probability distribution . for a review of multifractal applications in large - scale structure , see coleman & pietronero ( 1992 ) and borgani ( 1995 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce rnyi information as a valid characterization of any spatial structure , including galaxy distribution .",
    "we show that rnyi information , being closely related to probability distribution and multifractal measures , probes the statistical moments sensitive to any levels of under- and overdense spatial structures . at scales where the information contents are well - preserved and",
    "can be accurately quantified , statistical moments are jointly described by rnyi information and dimensions , for which the underlying generator has a physical origin .",
    "we also illustrate the procedure by applying the rnyi information , along with the probability distribution and multifractal measures , to observed galaxy samples in the infrared wavelengths as well as a simulation .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce rnyi information and the properties , the relations to the moments of the probability distribution function and to the multifractal measurements . in section [ sec : res ]",
    "we present the results of the probability distribution and rnyi information for the infrared samples observed by the infrared array camera ( irac ) onboard spitzer space telescope .",
    "we discuss a multiplicative cascade simulation in section [ sec : sim ] , which provides means of validating our methods of measurement , and showing the effects of spatial selections in our galaxy samples .",
    "we further derive the functions scanning the structure of the moments for the samples based on simulation results .",
    "we discuss our results and potential applications of the information measure in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "shannon & weaver ( 1948 ) derived an information measure to describe the amount of information needed in order to know the occurrence of an event with a given probability . in an important development , rnyi ( 1970 ) expanded shannon s information measure to arbitrary orders .",
    "suppose we have @xmath0 cells placed to cover a distribution of @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "this can either be a 2-dimensional angular or 3-dimensional spatial distribution .",
    "the probability @xmath2 of finding a galaxy in a given cell @xmath3 containing @xmath4 galaxies is @xmath5 .",
    "the rnyi information is defined as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the information order which in principle can be any real number ( although in our application we consider integers only ) . at positive orders the overdense structures dominate the information estimate , whereas the underdense structures contribute the most to the information measure at negative orders . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the rnyi information reduces to the shannon information .",
    "the summation term for the probabilities @xmath2 to order @xmath7 can also be written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the galaxy probability distribution function .",
    "therefore the rnyi information of order @xmath7 is related to the @xmath7-moment of the probability distribution as    @xmath11 , \\hspace{5 mm } \\beta \\neq 1,\\ ] ]    @xmath12    which is in turn related to the volume - averaged @xmath7-point correlation function @xcite .",
    "the relation is intuitively easy to understand as @xmath13 is simply the total probability of finding @xmath7 galaxies in a cell . at positive orders of integral @xmath7",
    "the rnyi information characterizes the amount of information corresponding to the event of finding @xmath7 galaxies in the cells covering the discrete galaxy distribution .",
    "some properties of the rnyi information indicate the behavior of the moments of the galaxy spatial distribution . it can be proved @xcite that    @xmath14    @xmath15    taking the logarithm we get    @xmath16    @xmath17    since @xmath18 we have @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "therefore there is an upper limit @xmath23 for all @xmath7 .",
    "we need zero information , or have perfect knowledge for an event when @xmath24 .",
    "the bounds are also reflected by    @xmath25    @xmath26    the rnyi information depend on the cell size @xmath27 , and diverge as @xmath28 .",
    "one property that remains finite at this limit is the so - called rnyi dimensions :    @xmath29    any galaxy distribution becomes discontinuous at the scale of the typical galaxy separation .",
    "the above limit is not achieved in a discrete distribution or in practical measurements .",
    "a more practical definition for galaxy distribution is the `` effective '' rnyi dimensions , for which we calculate the slope of @xmath30 versus @xmath31 .",
    "there is no reason _ a priori to expect the slope for a given order to be a constant over all scales for a given structure .",
    "in fact , this is not implied in equation [ eqn : rd ] for a continuous multifractal distribution .",
    "we call it a simple multifractal if the effective rnyi dimension for any given order has a single slope across all scales",
    ". _    examining rnyi information and dimensions over information orders is identical to inspecting the structure of statistical moments of a distribution . studying such scan functions",
    "has the advantage of summarizing infinite amount of parameters ( moments ) in just a few relations for a statistical distribution .",
    "here we relate rnyi dimensions to a scan function defined in a continuous multifractal field .",
    "suppose @xmath32 is the field density measured and ensemble - averaged at scale @xmath27 .",
    "function @xmath33 is the scaling exponent for moments of the field ( also called the structure function ) @xmath34 .",
    "now that the rnyi dimension is practically @xmath35 , since @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the counts in the cells of size @xmath27 , @xmath38 is the dimension of the space in which the distribution is embedded ( e.g. @xmath39 in our applications below ) , we obtain    @xmath40    function @xmath33 is therefore also called the codimension @xcite . here",
    "we use a general name , the structure scan function , for the rnyi information and dimensions as functions of @xmath7 , as well as for functions like @xmath33 .",
    "th multifractal dimensions are usually defined by using the generalized correlation integral @xcite .",
    "many measurements of the multifractal properties of galaxy distribution have been based on measuring the generalized correlation integral , which uses cells of varying sizes centered at selected galaxies .",
    "such a procedure is not valid for estimating rnyi information since neighboring cells bound to cross each other above a certain scale . below this scale",
    "there is a non - zero probability that some of the galaxies are not covered by the ensemble of cells .",
    "either case changes the normalization for the probabilities , and the rnyi information is not accurately quantified for the original structure .",
    "this is further explained in section [ sec : sim ] .",
    "we want to emphasize here that _ not only the slope of the rnyi information versus scale ( rnyi dimensions ) , but also the rnyi information itself is a physical measurement , both being open to physical interpretations .",
    "we will further discuss this point in section [ sec : dis ] . _    we note that the differential form of the second - order correlation integral is called the conditional density , which had been used to characterize galaxy distribution in early surveys @xcite .",
    "the rnyi dimensions basically show the scaling properties of rnyi information . loosely speaking",
    ", a multifractal galaxy distribution has a position - dependent scaling exponent @xmath41 in @xmath42 .",
    "it can be shown strictly @xcite that the spectra of these scaling exponents @xmath43 and the rnyi dimensions ( multiplied by a factor of @xmath44 ) are related by a legendre transformation    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "a number of interesting properties of @xmath49 and @xmath43 are discussed in beck ( 1990 ) .",
    "a few interesting ones include @xmath49 being a decreasing function of @xmath7 and bounded as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . these limits and the ways @xmath49 and @xmath43 approach the limits show the properties of the moments of the spatial distribution from a scan function perspective .",
    "the irac instrument onboard the spitzer space telescope provides fresh view into the cosmos in the mid - infrared wavelengths of 3.6 @xmath53 m , 4.5 @xmath53 m , 5.8 @xmath53 m , and 8.0 @xmath53 m .",
    "the spitzer first look survey ( fls ) using irac provides a uniform coverage of a 4 square - degree field centered at ra @xmath54 , dec @xmath55 with a total 60-second exposure time for each pixel in the @xmath56 arrays @xcite . for our present purpose ,",
    "we use the full galaxy samples established for an earlier 2-point correlation analysis @xcite across the irac wavelengths .",
    "we divide the two - dimensional area covered by an irac sample into square cells of varying sizes .",
    "the cells are non - overlapping and contiguous for the purpose of accurately estimating the rnyi information .",
    "the boundary of the sample area and the usage of a cell are determined by the mask files used to establish the galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "we always have @xmath57 `` good '' cells at the largest scales of measurement to ensure good statistics . at smaller scales",
    "the cell numbers are much greater .",
    "for each sample and each cell size we count the number of galaxies in the cells and establish the histograms in figure [ fig : cic ] .",
    "the histograms represent the estimates of the probability distribution function , from which the moments of the distribution can also be measured . for each histogram",
    ", we plot the fit of the theoretical gravitational quasi - equilibrium distribution function ( gqed ) @xcite .",
    "the single fitting parameter @xmath58 , the average ratio of the gravitational correlation potential energy to twice the kinetic energy , is also shown in the plots . for comparison , we also draw the poisson distributions with the same mean galaxy counts in cells of given sizes .",
    "apparently the galaxy distribution deviates more from the poisson distribution at larger cell sizes , indicating the effect of galaxy clustering in irac wavelengths .",
    "the gqed , on the other hand , describes the distributions of irac galaxies remarkably well over all scales .",
    "we follow the same procedures as in the counts - in - cells experiment to divide the irac sample areas into square cells to calculate the rnyi information .",
    "figure [ fig : infos ] shows the relation between the cell sizes and the measured rnyi information at orders from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the rnyi information scales with cell sizes , but the relation is not linear for our galaxy samples .",
    "we will discuss below the effects that can potentially change the scaling relation .",
    "the apparent crowding of the curves at high information orders implies an upper limit , which is @xmath61 based on the above discussion , for the information measures .",
    "the limit constrains the behavior of the moments of galaxy distribution in the information space .",
    "intuitively , exclusion of structures , such as galaxies not covered by the cells , or regions that cells avoid due to masking , changes the information content of the structure .",
    "although we intend to cover the sample using contiguous cells , changing cell - size causes some galaxies in the sample not being covered by cells of a new size due to the sample boundary and masked areas .",
    "until these effects can be fully accounted for , we are in fact measuring the information of slightly different structures at each scale , even though the probability is normalized by the total number of galaxies covered by cells .",
    "this introduces noises in the information measurements . in the next section ,",
    "we study these effects using simulation of a known structure .",
    "to verify our results , we generate a multiplicative cascade simulation based on a binomical model .",
    "the binomial model was found to describe well the multifractal scaling in the dissipation field of fully developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "we use the binomial model for its simplicity and analytically derivable relations for rnyi information and multifractal properties .",
    "the multiplicative cascade method was formulated to study energy transfers at different scales in turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is by far the most effective method to simulate a multifractal field .",
    "we use a discrete multiplicative cascade simulation , consistent with our purpose to study counts at multiple length scales .",
    "the simulation aims to create distributions of counts at ten different scales within a given area with a conserved overall number density @xmath62 . at the first level ,",
    "the area is divided into four quadrants of the same size , two of which hold a fraction @xmath63 of @xmath62 , and the other two have the fraction @xmath64 ( so the overall number density is conserved as @xmath62 ; also called the canonical process ) .",
    "there are many ways to distribute the two number densities equally among four cells .",
    "we choose to have a fixed pattern of distribution here .",
    "we tested different patterns and the results are the same .    at the second level , each quadrant area is further divided into four identical ( smaller ) cells , with the distribution of the same probabilities of the same pattern .",
    "the number counts in a cell is the product of the probability assigned at this level multiplied by the probability ( of the quadrant covering the cell ) at the previous level ( and by an arbitrary total source number , which we choose to use @xmath59 ) .",
    "we continue the process to generate smaller and smaller cells and their number counts .",
    "we stop at the tenth level where we have data over 10 scales ( of ratio 2 ) for statistics . at level @xmath65",
    ", a cell has the number count proportional to @xmath66 , where @xmath3 is an integer between @xmath61 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore it is called the binomial model . the resulting structure , although modulated sharply by cell edges , is a simple multifractal .",
    "based on halsey et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and meneveau & sreenivasan ( 1987 ) , we derive the rnyi information , the rnyi dimensions , and the spectra of the multifractal scaling exponent for the 2-dimensional binomial field as    @xmath67,\\ ] ]    @xmath68    @xmath69    where @xmath65 is the level number in the cascade ( e.g. smallest scale being @xmath70 ) , and @xmath7 is the information order .    figure [ fig : infosim ] shows the scaling of rnyi information in the binomial field .",
    "the measurements , using the same methods and algorithm used for the infrared samples , are indicated by points in the figure .",
    "the lines are calculated based on equation [ eqn : binfo ] .",
    "the agreement is nearly perfect for all orders .",
    "next we compare measurements of the rnyi dimensions and multifractal spectra with those predicted by equations [ eqn : mdbi ] and [ eqn : idbi ] .",
    "since the scaling of the measured rnyi information in figure [ fig : infosim ] is well - represented by lines , we use linear least - square fit for each information order in that figure to obtain the rnyi dimensions .",
    "we confirm from the fit that the information values at the smallest scale ( where @xmath71 ) and the slope are both within @xmath72 of those predicted by equations [ eqn : binfo ] and [ eqn : mdbi ] .",
    "the slope values from the fit for each order are plotted as dots in the left - panel of figure [ fig : spectsim ] .",
    "the line is the scan function for rnyi dimensions based on equation [ eqn : mdbi ] . to obtain the multifractal spectra",
    ", we use a cubic spline fit to model the measured rnyi dimensions and derive the @xmath73 and @xmath43 values within the range of information orders .",
    "these values are again represented by the dots in the right - panel of figure [ fig : spectsim ] .",
    "the line in the figure is based on equation [ eqn : idbi ] . in both panels",
    "the values based on the measured renyi information agree well with the predicted ones .",
    "this shows the reliability of the methods and algorithms we use .    in figure",
    "[ fig : corsim ] we show measurements of generalized correlation integral superimposed on the plane of rnyi information versus scale for our simulation .",
    "we generate @xmath74 cell positions in the @xmath75 field , and vary the size of the cells centered around these positions .",
    "cells may overlap , but are ignored if they cross the field boundary .",
    "the generalized correlation integral is calculated using the remaining cells , following the standard algorithm @xcite . in the figure",
    "the dash - lines are generalized correlation integral measurements , and solid - lines are the predicted rnyi information .",
    "it is clear that although the rnyi dimensions may be approximately maintained , the generalized correlation integral does not measure rnyi information .",
    "we also find that the values of the generalized correlation integral depends on the number of cells in the experiment , further strengthening this point .    to investigate the effects of spatial selection of structures , we include the mask files on which the irac samples are based .",
    "each of the mask files is a fits representation of the fls field with a dimension of @xmath76 pixels . since our simulation has a different dimension , we first project these masks onto a @xmath75-pixel field",
    "this procedure maintains the scale ratio of the masked areas and the field size .",
    "we then follow the same criteria to exclude cells in the simulation field overlapping with projected masked areas , and repeat the procedures of measuring the rnyi information in the simulated field .",
    "the results , using the mask files for the four irac samples , are shown in figure [ fig : masksim ] , with solid - line predictions superimposed on measured points connected by dotted lines .",
    "there is an obvious effect of spatial selection on measuring both rnyi information and dimensions .",
    "notably involving the irac masks introduces an apparent scale - dependency of rnyi dimensions , particularly at greater scales , where both the rnyi information and dimensions are higher than predicted . at smaller scales , there is a systematic offset to higher ( negative ) information values , although the slopes for rnyi dimensions are approximately maintained .",
    "masking reduces the amount of structures in the original binomial field , and smaller amount of information ( identical to the absolute value of the measured rnyi information ) is needed to know an event occuring ( such as @xmath7 sources in a cell ) with a given probability .",
    "cells of increasing scales may cover a fluctuating , but generally increasingly smaller samples from the original structure accompanied by a mask .",
    "this confirms our intuition that rnyi information is an intrinsic property of a spatial structure .",
    "any modifications of the structure modify its information content .",
    "other derived properties such as the rnyi dimensions can also be affected if not measured properly . while the geometry and pattern of the four mask files vary , the effects on the rnyi information are remarkably similar .",
    "although it changes the information contents of the original structure , it appears that the irac masks preserve the scaling of the information at smaller scales .",
    "the graininess of galaxy distribution , however , introduces a poisson limit for these smaller scales ( remember our simulation is not grainy ) , below which a cell contains either one or no galaxy in most of the regions .",
    "any multifractal behavior breaks down at this limit . at scales",
    "smaller , the number of cells contributing to the rnyi information is roughly identical to the total number of galaxies , and the rnyi information reaches a ( lower ) limit also and flattens out ( also see figure [ fig : structinfo ] below ) .",
    "both these effects at large and small scales can make the rnyi information curves of a multifractal become concave .",
    "this curvature is observed in figure [ fig : infos ] .",
    "based on the irac sample sizes and the un - masked areas for the samples , we estimate the mean separations of any two galaxies in the samples , which are roughly @xmath77 for irac-1 and 2 , @xmath78 for irac-3 and 4 samples , assuming uniform distributions .",
    "we use these as the lower scale limit for reliable multifractal estimate . for upper limit ,",
    "figure [ fig : masksim ] implies a linear scale of @xmath79 of the field size , assuming that the scale ratio applys to the fls field .",
    "this is only slightly higher than the lower limit of irac channel-3 and 4 samples . basically , the smaller number of galaxies in these samples combined with the amount of masking prevented us from reliably estimating the multifractal behavior for these two samples .    for illustration purpose , we perform a cubic spline fit to each of the rnyi information relations in figure [ fig : infos ] , and derive the rnyi dimensions and the scan function for irac-1 and 2 samples at a scale of @xmath80 .",
    "we perform another cubic spline fit to the scan functions ( like we did for the binomial field ) and obtain @xmath73 and @xmath43 throughout the range of rnyi dimensions . in figure",
    "[ fig : spect ] we show these relations for the two fls samples .",
    "the figure illustrates how rnyi dimensions decrease with increasing information order , and converge to a limit .",
    "also @xmath43 appears to be a convex function of @xmath73 . where @xmath81 , the @xmath73 values represent the rnyi dimension limit when @xmath82 .",
    "all are typical behaviors of multifractals .    in figure",
    "[ fig : structinfo ] , we plot the rnyi information as a function of order , a different type of scan function , measured for orders @xmath83 to @xmath60 at scales of @xmath77 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath78 , and @xmath86 for all irac samples . at most of these",
    "scales the masking effect is small , where the information can be measured accurately for galaxy distribution . for samples at irac channels 3 and 4 ,",
    "however , poisson effects dominate the three smaller scales .",
    "this is told by the scan curves converging to the poisson limit below or near information order zero . for all irac samples ,",
    "the limit is shown by the scan curve behavior at negative information orders , where the information measure is sensitive to and dominated by underdense regions in the samples . at positive orders and at scales where information can be measured accurately ,",
    "the scan curves tell the structures of high moments of the galaxy distribution .",
    "we have shown that the rnyi information , the effective rnyi dimensions , their structure scan functions , and the multifractal spectra contain the properties of the high moments of a spatial distribution .",
    "these measurements can be used to scan properties of these high moments .",
    "these properties detect the amount of deviation from gaussian densities , and are highly constrained in the parameter space in these measurements .",
    "our experiments also show that spatial selection effects are important and can bias these measurements .",
    "any selection modifies the original structure and the amount of rnyi information the structure contains .",
    "depending on the amount of selection , the rnyi dimensions may be maintained over a limited range of scales above the poisson limit for discrete distributions .",
    "one needs to conduct controlled experiments such as simulations to verify at these scales . for irac-1 and 2 samples",
    ", there is indication in figure [ fig : infos ] that the information - scale relation is still not linear within the range .",
    "it is yet uncertain how much of this is caused by masking as well as by approaching the poisson limit , both effects leading systematically to a concave curve , or if there is scale - dependency for the rnyi dimensions in our irac samples , which would imply a more complex structure than a simple multifractal distribution at these scales .    whether galaxy spatial distribution is a multifractal , or whether homogeneity can be reached at large scales , as cosmological principle states ,",
    "has been observationally a controversial issue @xcite .",
    "our analyses show that caution needs to be exercised extrapolating a multifractal structure to small and large scales , particularly if spatial selection exists for a galaxy sample , even if multifractality is observed at scales more reliable for multifractal measurements .",
    "it may be possible to recover the lost information in a galaxy sample by `` filling - in '' the masks based on known properties of galaxy distribution .",
    "such known properties may come from minimally - masked samples of galaxies of the same type , or from @xmath37-body simulations , for examples .",
    "just as the @xmath87-function for generating the probability in our multiplicative cascade simulation , there is a variety of statistical functions that can serve as the generating functions for simulating full - scale multifractal fields @xcite . among these generating functions",
    "the log - lvy distribution is of particular interest due to the unique position of the lvy distribution in replacing a gaussian in the generalized central - limit theorem where variances of the component distributions can be infinite , and also due to its applications to a `` universal class '' of geophysical structures @xcite .",
    "the structure scan functions are uniquely determined by probability generating functions which are of physical origin .",
    "the generating function would be a significant property to know if galaxy distribution is a multifractal to large scales .    another way to seek physically interpreting",
    "the rnyi information is to use the moments of the probability distribution via equations [ eqn : infomo ] and [ eqn : infomo1 ] , which are not restricted to a multifractal structure . since @xmath88 , where @xmath38 is the dimension of the space the distribution is embedded",
    ", we can also derive for equation [ eqn : infomo ]      where @xmath90 is the @xmath7-moment of the probability distribution function .",
    "it is clear from the relation that we have a simple multifractal distribution across all scales only if @xmath91 is not a function of scale .",
    "this is not the case for gqed , for example . on the other hand",
    ", any physically - derived probability distribution can interpret the rnyi information and dimensions via these relations .",
    "independent of the multifractality of a structure , the rnyi information and dimensions are general characterizations of statistical properties of the structure . a simple multifractal is a special and very restrictive type of structure in its practical definition .",
    "the rnyi information and dimensions and their corresponding scan functions can describe any types of structures , whether or not multifractals .",
    "the rnyi information is extensive , whereas its scaling , or `` information rate '' with changing scales is an intensive parameter .",
    "both are important for a given structure . as we collect galaxy samples from surveys with greater area coverage and increasing depth as well as in more wavelength channels",
    ", we are collecting increasingly more information about the large - scale structure , and the absolute values of the measured rnyi information increase at a given scale .",
    "any variations of the rnyi dimensions , on the other hand , are of different origin .    for spatially confined structures , such as a giant molecular cloud",
    ", the extensivity of rnyi information also depends on resolution .",
    "a more resolved observation reveals more detailed structure , and therefore more information contents . while the rnyi information and dimensions can be identically applied to continuous and discrete spatial fields , it is important to recognize what properties are used for measurement .",
    "it is clear that we want to characterize the moments of a spatial structure , and that we can use spatial densities for measuring .",
    "an astronomical observation is usually a radiation measurement , however , and the proportionality between the two is only an assumption . for non - astronomical structures ,",
    "the meaning of the measurements can be more clear - cut .",
    "the rnyi information and dimensions can also be applied to one - dimensional time - series . in the temporal domain",
    ", the amount of time - delay serves as scaling , and the information contents and rate describe the temporal structure built by distributions of the change of the observed properties over certain and different time - spans .",
    "an information measure is a measure about the knowledge of a structure or system , and therefore its predictability",
    ". it would be desirable to quantify the predictability of a statistical distribution or a time - series using rnyi information and dimensions .",
    "so far research on this topic remains limited .",
    "the relation between the rnyi information and dimensions measured in 2-dimension and those in 3 dimensional space for the same structure can be straightforward . the 2-dimensional cells used to cover a structure can also be 3-dimensional cells with the third dimension extended to cover the same structure .",
    "when properties such as spatial density can be accounted for by measurements when projecting the structure onto a 2-dimensional area , the information is not lost . the only uncertainty is the correspondence between the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional scales .",
    "it is , however , a generally interesting question what scales are measured by cells of non - identical dimensions . for galaxy spatial distribution , the evolutionary effects of galaxies in the third dimension need to be disentangled from projection before the structure can be analyzed in three dimensions .",
