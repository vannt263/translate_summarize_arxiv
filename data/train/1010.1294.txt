    "we address here the following question : what is the asymptotic size and the limit laws of the smallest and largest gaps or spacings in the spectra of random matrices ?",
    "typical spacings between eigenvalues of random matrices have been well understood for invariant ensembles for quite some time .",
    "more recently , the behavior of these typical spacings has even been proved to be universal for much larger classes of random matrices ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "much less is known for atypically large or small spacings .",
    "this question was first considered for the smallest spacings in the unpublished phd thesis of j.vinson ( @xcite ) and raised by persi diaconis in @xcite for the largest ones .",
    "it was also discussed in an interesting debate during a conference at the courant institute in 2006 , in honor of percy deift .",
    "we solve here completely the question of the smallest spacings for the simplest invariant ensembles , i.e the cue and the gue .",
    "we give the scaling and the limit laws for the joint distribution of the smallest spacings .",
    "the answer is simple to state : it is given by the trivial poissonian ansatz where the spacings would be treated as i.i.d random variables .",
    "the answer we find for the largest spacings is less complete , since we can only obtain at this point a first - order approximation which gives the asymptotic size of the largest spacings and not their limit laws .",
    "we believe that the same poissonian ansatz should work as well for the largest gaps , but this question is left open .",
    "the question of the universality of the behavior of the extremal spacings is also left open .",
    "dyson @xcite showed that the repulsion between eigenvalues of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( the gue ) could be described asymptotically in terms of the _ determinantal _ point process associated with the sine kernel @xmath6 for this limiting determinantal point process , the probability of having no eigenvalue in an interval of size @xmath7 is known to be the fredholm determinant @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the convolution operator acting on @xmath10 with kernel @xmath11 .",
    "the density of the spacing between two successive points is then given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath12 this spacing distribution was shown to appear in a number - theoretic context : some statistics produced by odlyzko @xcite presented a correspondence between the histogram of normalized gaps between zeros of the riemann zeta function and @xmath13 .",
    "this gave further evidence for the analogy discovered by dyson and montgomery : they realized that the local dependence of the zeros of @xmath14 , previously calculated by montgomery , involved the sine kernel ( see @xcite , @xcite for an historical account and other steps of this fruitful analogy ) . at the same mean or typical gap scale , a precise analysis of the joint distribution of the gaps between eigenvalues was performed by katz - sarnak @xcite and soshnikov @xcite , for the circular unitary ensemble ( the cue ) .",
    "less attention was paid to eigenvalues statistics at smaller and larger scales",
    ". this paper concerns the extreme gaps .",
    "this study was initiated by j. vinson @xcite : he showed that the smallest gap between elements of the @xmath15 , multiplied by @xmath1 , converges in law to a random variable with distribution function @xmath16 , as the size @xmath17 of the unitary matrix increases . in his thesis ,",
    "similar results for the smallest gap between eigenvalues of a generalization of the @xmath18 were obtained .",
    "vinson also gives interesting heuristics suggesting that the largest gap between @xmath15 eigenvalues should be of order @xmath19 , with poissonian fluctuations around this limit . using a different technique ,",
    "soshnikov @xcite investigated the smallest gaps for determinantal point processes on the real line , with a translation invariant kernel : amongst points included in @xmath20 $ ] , this extreme spacing multiplied by @xmath21 converges weakly to the distribution with distribution function @xmath16 , as @xmath22 .",
    "heuristically , the above extreme gaps asymptotics can be obtained using the known asymptotics @xcite of the spacing distribution @xmath23 and treating the gaps as independent random variables .",
    "the difficulty to obtain rigorous results lies in showing that this poissonian ansatz is asymptotically correct for the extreme gaps , and in making the above estimates uniform in the dimension @xmath17 .",
    "we first consider the _ joint _ law of the smallest gaps ( theorem [ thm : unitary ] , corollary [ cor : smallestunitary ] ) between eigenvalues of unitary matrices .",
    "this relies both on soshnikov s method and a convergence of the process of small gaps to a poisson point process .",
    "the same reasoning equally applies to the small gaps between eigenvalues from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( theorem [ thm : g ] , corollary [ cor : smallestgue ] ) .",
    "the proofs of the small spacings asymptotics are in section 2 .",
    "the first order asymptotics of the largest gaps is then proved . concerning unitary random matrices ( theorem [ thm : largestgaps ] )",
    ", this makes use of two important tools .",
    "a key ingredient , by deift & al @xcite , is the uniform asymptotics about the probability for a given arc of the circle to be free of eigenvalues .",
    "the proof also requires the negative correlation property for the event that two disjoint arcs are free of eigenangles . on account of the @xmath18 ( theorem [ thm : largestgapsgue ] )",
    ", we also make a essential use of the negative correlation , and the large gap probability is evaluated by comparing the @xmath18 fredholm determinant with the unitary one .",
    "these large gaps asymptotics are proved in section 3 .",
    "the extreme spacings between random eigenvalues are important quantities for statistical physics , computational mathematics and number theory .",
    "for this reason , diaconis @xcite mentions the open question of maximal spacings , answered in theorem [ thm : largestgaps ] . after making our results explicit , successively for unitary matrices and the gue ensemble , we give applications of our extremal spacings statistics at the end of this introduction .",

    "suppose @xmath24 has eigenvalues @xmath27 s , with ordered eigenangles @xmath28 consider the point process on @xmath29 @xmath30 our first result is about the convergence of @xmath31 to a poisson point process , thanks to this normalization by @xmath32 .",

    "the intensity is proportional to @xmath39 because of the rotational invariance of the haar measure .",
    "the corresponding factor will be less trivial in the case of the @xmath18 ensemble .",
    "our method to prove theorem [ thm : unitary ] relies on the _ s - modified _ random point field technique initiated by soshnikov @xcite : one can calculate the correlation functions of the process obtained by keeping only the @xmath40 s for which @xmath41 contains exactly one other eigenvalue .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we do not use the notion of cluster functions , because we characterize the convergence to poisson random variables thanks to the convergence of the factorial moments ; this allows also to consider easily non translation invariant kernels , like in the @xmath18 case . moreover , theorem [ thm : unitary ] gives information about the joint distribution of the number of gaps taking values in disjoint intervals ( convergence in terms of point processes ) .",
    "in particular we can compute the limiting joint law of the smallest gaps .",
    "let @xmath42 be the @xmath0 smallest eigenangles gaps ( i.e. of the form @xmath43 , where the indexes are modulo @xmath17 and gaps are defined as small as possible , i.e. @xmath44 $ ] ) .",
