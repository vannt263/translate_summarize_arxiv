    "linear and nonlinear transport processes and nonequilibrium phenomena in dilute non - ionic ( neutral ) fluids have been known adequately treatable by means of singlet distribution functions obeying , for example , the boltzmann equations and related kinetic equations@xcite for singlet distribution functions . relying on the experience gained from the theories of neutral dilute fluids , theories of ionized gases@xcite , plasmas , and charge carriers in semiconductors@xcite often rely on singlet distribution functions obeying boltzmann - like kinetic equations and their suitable modifications . however , since ions in ionized fluids interact through long - ranged coulombic interactions , even if the ionized species are dilute in concentration , their spatial correlations are significant , lingering on to manifest their effects even in the infinitely dilute regime of concentration as the thermodynamic properties ( e.g. , activity coefficients ) of ionic solutions demonstrate",
    ". therefore it would be very important to find a way , and learn , to incorporate long - range correlations into the theory of nonequilibrium phenomena and transport processes in ionized fluids and therein lies the significance of the limiting theory of conductivity in ionized liquids in the external field of arbitrary strength described in this work .",
    "interestingly , in the subject fields of nonlinear phenomena in ionic liquids , the wien effect@xcite was one of the earliest experimental examples that exhibited a marked nonlinear deviation from the coulombic law of conduction and , as such , it attracted considerable attention theoretically and experimentally .",
    "being a nonlinear effect in ionic conductance which shows a strongly nonlinear , non - coulombic field - dependence of ionic conductance , the phenomenon was studied actively in physical chemistry until several decades ago to understand ionic solutions and their physical properties@xcite .",
    "recently , there appears to be a revival of experimental studies on wien effect and related aspects in ionic conductance of ionic liquids in the presence of high external electric fields@xcite .",
    "there are other many fascinating aspects of physical properties of ionic liquids recently being studied actively and reported in the recent literature@xcite , although they are mostly in the field of equilibrium phenomena . in the present series of work ,",
    "we are interested in nonlinear transport processes and , in particular , learning about the theories of the wien effect on ionic conductance in electrolyte solutions in order to gain insights and theoretical approaches to treat the currently studied properties of ionic fluids . as a first step to this aim",
    ", we will study strong binary ( symmetric ) electrolytes because of the relative simplicity of the subject matter .",
    "more complicated systems of asymmetric electrolytes , in which the charges in a molecule are asymmetric , will be treated in the sequels@xcite to this work in preparation .",
    "the ideas@xcite of physical mechanisms underlying the wien effect , which might also encompass nonlinear phenomena in general in ionic fluids , proceed as follows .",
    "it is founded on the idea of ion atmosphere in debye s theory@xcite of electrolyte solutions . according to his theory ,",
    "ion atmosphere is formed around ions in the solution , which is spherically symmetric if the ions are spherical and the system is in equilibrium . when the external electric field is applied to the ionic fluid ,",
    "the ions of opposite charges begin to move in directions opposite to each other .",
    "thus the basic physical mechanisms involved in the ionic movements under the external field are believed to be due to a distortion of the spherically symmetric ion atmosphere into a non - spherical form and its subsequent tendency to relax to a spherically symmetric form .",
    "the former effect gives rise to the electrophoretic effect and the latter to the relaxation time effect .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the aforementioned effects are on the ionic atmosphere , but not on the ion of attention situated at the center of ion atmosphere .",
    "this idea can be translated into a qualitative mathematical form as given below : in experiments , we measure migration of ions and accompanying flow of medium . if the external electric field is denoted @xmath4 , the force @xmath5 on ion @xmath6 of charge @xmath7 is then given by@xmath8 since the ion of charge @xmath7 in the solution creates an ion atmosphere of charge @xmath9 , which is distributed in the ion atmosphere to balance the charge in the solution , and this atmosphere is subjected to a force of @xmath10 .",
    "this force tends to move the ion atmosphere in the direction of force @xmath10 , while the central ion @xmath6 of atmosphere is carried by force @xmath11 in the medium in the direction opposite to the motion of ion atmosphere in order to balance the momentum .",
    "the velocity of the _ countercurrent _ generated thereby may be readily calculated if it is assumed that the entire countercharge @xmath9 of the atmosphere is distributed in a spherical shell of radius @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the debye radius of ion atmosphere from the central ion , and that the motion of this sphere of radius @xmath12 surrounding the central charge is governed by the stokes law@xcite holding for the motion of a sphere in a viscous fluid .",
    "thus , this velocity of the countercurrent is estimated to be @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity of the shell of radius @xmath12 and @xmath15 is the viscosity of the medium .",
    "we are thus led to the result that the medium in the interior of the shell travels with this velocity , and that the central ion migrates against a collective current of the medium in the shell .",
    "the deduction of this expression qualitatively elucidates the most important part of the effect of electrophoresis .",
    "clearly , this effect has to do with hydrodynamic motion of the solvent around the center ion enclosed by the ion atmosphere of radius @xmath12 that moves against the former .",
    "one may therefore quantify this qualitative description by means of a hydrodynamic method using the navier  stokes equation@xcite , but the navier  stokes equation requires _ _ a local body - force__local mean external force  as an input .",
    "this local body - force can not be obtained through a purely phenomenological consideration , but , for example , must be calculated by means of statistical mechanics combined with classical electrodynamics . before proceeding to the remaining effect , it is important to point out that eq .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) gives the velocity of a physical object of radius @xmath12 ( i.e. , the radius of ion atmosphere ) in the direction of @xmath4 .",
    "the second effect , that is , the relaxation time effect , is seen as follows : if the central ion possessed no atmosphere , it would simply migrate with a velocity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the friction constant , but owing to its ion atmosphere , the ion is subjected to a net force , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the force arising from the dissymmetry of the ion atmosphere created by the movement of the ions in the external field , and hence it will move , relative to its environment , with a velocity of a magnitude , @xmath20 .",
    "this @xmath19 is due to the effect arising from the relaxation of the asymmetric ion atmosphere .",
    "consequently , the net velocity @xmath21 of ion @xmath6 is given by@xmath22 here @xmath23 represents the relaxation time effect on relaxation to a spherically symmetric form of the distorted ion atmosphere , and the last term the electrophoretic effect .",
    "the aforementioned two effects making up the velocity given in eq .",
    "( [ k4 ] ) are believed to underlie in charge conduction in electrolytic solutions .",
    "in fact , the mobility of ions induced by an external electric field can be calculated on the basis of the aforementioned two effects , for example , by using eq .",
    "( [ k4 ] ) .",
    "as we can see from this heuristic discussion , the aforementioned two effects require the velocity of the fluid ( medium ) , which obviously obeys the hydrodynamic equations for the system subjected to an external electric field .",
    "since such velocity solutions can be obtained from the stokes equation , more generally , navier  stokes equation , we may apply the solutions thereof to calculate the charge conductance and the countercurrent of the medium to learn the mode of charge conductance in electrolyte solutions subjected to an external field .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations , however , contain external body - forces , which in the present case are the external electric field .",
    "the external electric field or body - force is generally local and depends on the local distribution of charges .",
    "the local charge distributions require molecular distributions in the system and a statistical mechanical theory for them  a molecular theory .",
    "to answer this question , onsager@xcite with fuoss formulated a formal framework of theory in which a fokker  planck - type differential equations for nonequilibrium pair distribution functions are derived on the assumption of a brownian motion model for ions in a continuous medium of dielectric constant @xmath24 and viscosity @xmath15 .",
    "we will refer to these differential equations for pair correlation functions as the onsager ",
    "fuoss ( of ) equations henceforth .",
    "they are coupled to the poisson equations@xcite of classical electrodynamics for the ionic potentials .",
    "these two coupled systems of differential equations will be referred to as the governing equations in the present work .",
    "the governing equations were applied to study the ionic conductance of binary strong electrolytes in an external electric field by wilson in his dissertation@xcite .",
    "this theory will be referred to as the onsager ",
    "wilson ( ow ) theory .",
    "wilson solved the governing equations and obtained analytic formulas for the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients and the equivalent ionic conductance qualitatively displaying the wien effect in the regime of strong electric fields .",
    "unfortunately , his dissertation has never been published in public domain , but only important results , such as the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients , had been excerpted in the well - known monograph@xcite by harned and owen on electro - physical chemistry . tantalized by the possibility of the utility of the theory for recent experimental results for ionic fluids and charge carrier mobilities in semiconductors referred to earlier , we have thoroughly examined the ow theory to learn the details of it .",
    "_ surprisingly , we have discovered that the velocity solution of the stokes ( hydrodynamic ) equation in the ow theory can give rise to a divergent result rendering into question the electrophoretic coefficient calculated by wilson s procedure described in his dissertation@xcite . _",
    "we believe that the basic framework of governing equations  the of equations and poisson equations  should be correct , but the way the solutions are evaluated by him may be called into question . therefore , it is our principal aim of this work to analyze the solutions of the governing equations in the case of binary strong electrolytes in an external electric field and obtain physically reasonable and thus acceptable theoretical results that can be made use of to study experimental data on conductivity and other transport phenomena in the high field regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the governing differential equations , which consist of the of equations for the ionic pair distribution functions and the poisson equations for the potentials of ionic interaction .",
    "we note that kirkwood @xcite also derived a similar equation for non - ionic liquids in his kinetic theory of liquids .",
    "one ( bce ) of the present authors also derived @xcite the of equations from the generalized boltzmann equation.@xcite since wilson s dissertation@xcite has not been published anywhere in a journal , the governing equations and their solutions are discussed to the extent that the present paper can be followed intelligibly .    in sec .",
    "iii , the solutions of the governing equations  the pair distribution functions and potentials of ionic interaction  are presented in the case of a strong binary electrolyte solution subjected to an external field .",
    "these solutions are given in one - dimensional fourier transforms in an axially symmetric coordinate system , namely , a cylindrical coordinate system whose axial coordinate is parallel to the applied external electric field .",
    "the fourier transform is with respect to the axial coordinate .",
    "the distribution functions obtained are nonequilibrium pair distribution functions which describe the nonequilibrium ionic liquid structure , and the nonequilibrium ionic potentials of interaction in the external field . since they should be of considerable interest to help us learn about the nonequilibrium ionic liquid properties we study the solutions of the governing equations in detail and obtain , especially , their spatial profiles , indicating how ions and their nonequilibrium part of the potentials are distributed in the external electric field .",
    "it should be noted that the distribution functions are the nonequilibrium corrections to the boltzmann distribution function predicted by the debye ",
    "hckel theory@xcite of electrolytes , and similarly for the potentials .    in sec .",
    "iv , we then discuss the solutions of the stokes equation , which replaces the navier  stokes equation in the case of incompressible fluids that we assume the ionic solution of interest is . solving the stokes equation",
    ", we obtain the axial and transversal velocity components as well as the nonequilibrium pressure from the solutions of the stokes equation .",
    "we present the solution procedure for the stokes equation in detail , because , firstly , wilson s thesis contains only the symmetric part of the solution , leaving out the antisymmetric part that turns out to be comparable to the former in magnitude and , secondly , we believe that the solution procedure of the stokes equations , which combines statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics in a rather intriguing manner , appears to be very much worth learning , especially , if one is interested in nonequilibrium theories of ionic liquids in an external electric field . in this section",
    "we also discuss the connection with the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients originally obtained by wilson , who evaluated them at the position of the center ion of ion atmosphere , namely , at the coordinate origin .",
    "this discussion would show that one of his integrals evaluated at the coordinate origin is divergent .",
    "therefore we evaluate explicitly the solutions to explore a way to make the ow theory of ionic conductance unencumbered by such a divergence difficulty .    in sec .",
    "iv , we also compute numerically the spatial profiles of the axial velocity , and study them to guide us to avoid the divergence difficulty mentioned in connection with wilson s result  and choose the optimum position coordinates at which to calculate the relaxation time and electrophoretic coefficients . to this aim",
    "we have either evaluated analytically or reduced to one - dimensional quadratures , by means of contour integration methods , the fourier transform integrals making up the solutions of the stokes equations obtained earlier before computing their spatial profiles .",
    "the contour integration methods are described in appendix a. since they , however , do not cover the entire coordinate space owing to the condition imposed by jordan s lemma@xcite on applicability of contour integration methods involving integrations along a circle of infinite radius , the integrals must be numerically computed outside the region where the aforementioned condition is violated .",
    "the details of the condition are discussed in sec .",
    "iv and also in appendix a. these numerical studies reveal the manner in which the ions flow subject to the applied external electric field provide insight into the behavior of the velocity and valuable clues to formulate an empirical rule to select the position parameters ( @xmath25 ) in the electrophoretic factor , so that a physically sensible and non - divergent electrophoretic coefficient and the corresponding relaxation time coefficient can be defined and ionic conductance correctly predicted .",
    "this problem is addressed in the companion paper .",
    "v is for discussion and concluding remark .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the position vector of ion @xmath6 in a fixed coordinate system and @xmath27 the relative coordinate of ion @xmath28 from ion @xmath6:@xmath29 and let @xmath30 denote the concentration of ion @xmath28 in the atmosphere of ion @xmath6 located at position @xmath26in other words , the distribution function to find ion @xmath28 at distance @xmath31 from ion @xmath6 located at @xmath26 . at equilibrium",
    "it is given by the boltzmann distribution function times the density of ion @xmath6 .",
    "let us also denote by @xmath32 the velocity of ion @xmath28 in the neighborhood of ion @xmath6 .",
    "therefore this velocity also depends on positions of ions @xmath28 and @xmath6 in the following manner:@xmath33 the equation of continuity for ion pair @xmath34 is then given by@xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
