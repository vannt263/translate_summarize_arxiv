    "hadronic distribution amplitudes ( das ) are the longitudinal projection of the hadronic wave functions obtained by integrating the transverse momenta of the fundamental constituents  @xcite .",
    "these nonperturbative quantities are defined as vacuum - to - hadron matrix elements of particular nonlocal quark or quark - gluon operators and thus encode important information on bound states in qcd .",
    "especially , the electromagnetic and transition form factors at high @xmath3 as well as the @xmath4-physics phenomenology in the context of su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking effect require a detailed information of meson das .",
    "meson das are also indispensable for the analysis of hard exclusive electroproduction based on the qcd factorization  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the shape of the pion da has been extensively discussed due to the nature of the pion as the massless nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "finding the fundamental nonperturbative information of qcd motivated many theoretical studies to calculate meson das using nonperturbative methods such as the qcd sum rule  @xcite , the chiral - quark model from the instanton vacuum  @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) approach  @xcite , and the light - front quark model  ( lfqm )  @xcite . among them , the lfqm appears to be one of the most effective and efficient tools in studying hadron physics as it takes advantage of the distinguished features of the light - front dynamics ( lfd )  @xcite . working in minkowski space",
    ", the lfd allows the study of physical observables both in spacelike and timelike kinematic regions .",
    "the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation of lfd , namely @xmath5 , yields the sign correlation between the light - front  ( lf ) energy @xmath6 and the lf longitudinal momentum @xmath7 and leads to the suppression of vacuum fluctuations in lfd .",
    "it facilitates the partonic interpretation of the hadronic amplitudes .",
    "the lfd also carries the maximum number   ( seven ) of the kinetic ( or interaction independent ) generators and thus the less effort in dynamics is necessary in order to get the qcd solutions that reflect the full poincar@xmath8 symmetries .",
    "based on the advantage of lfd , the lfqm has been quite successful in describing various static and non - static properties of hadrons  @xcite such as meson mass spectra  @xcite , the decay constants ( i.e. the lowest moments of light - cone das )  @xcite , electromagnetic and weak transition form factors  @xcite and generalized parton distributions  ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "the lfqm analysis of the pion form factor  @xcite has also provided compatible results both in spacelike and timelike regions with the holographic approach to lf qcd  @xcite based on the 5-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and the conformal symmetry which has given insight into the nature of the effective confinement potential and the resulting lf wave functions for both light and heavy mesons  @xcite .    through the recent analysis of the twist-2 and twist-3 das of pseudoscalar and vector mesons  @xcite , we discussed also the link between the chiral symmetry of qcd and the lfqm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed the two - particle twist-2 das of pseudoscalar  ( @xmath9 ) and vector  ( @xmath10 ) mesons using our lfqm  @xcite .",
    "we then extended our lfqm to analyze two - particle twist-3 pseudoscalar ( @xmath0 ) das of pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite and chirality - even twist-3 ( @xmath11 ) das of vector mesons  @xcite to discuss the link between the chiral symmetry of qcd and the numerical results of the lfqm .",
    "in particular , through the analysis of twist-3 das of @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons , we observed that the lfqm with effective degrees of freedom represented by the constituent quark and antiquark could provide the view of effective zero - mode cloud around the quark and antiquark inside the meson .",
    "our numerical results appeared consistent with this view and effectively indicated that the constituent quark and antiquark in the lfqm could be considered as the dressed constituents including the zero - mode quantum fluctuations from the vacuum .    to discuss the wave function dependence of the lf zero - mode  @xcite contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath11 ,",
    "we analyzed both the exactly solvable manifestly covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) model and the more phenomenologically accessible realistic lfqm  @xcite in the standard lf approach .",
    "the purpose of taking the exactly solvable covariant bs model was to check the existence ( or absence ) of the zero mode in each channel , e.g. @xmath0 or @xmath11 , without any ambiguity .",
    "for example , performing the lf calculation in the covariant bs model with the multipole type @xmath14 bound state vertex function , we not only showed that the twist-3 @xmath0 and @xmath11 receive both the zero - mode and the instantaneous contributions but also identified the zero - mode operator corresponding to the zero - mode contribution .",
    "as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we also found the universal mapping [ see e.g. eq . ( 35 ) in  @xcite ] between the covariant bs model and the standard lfqm for any two - point and three - point functions . with this mapping , we were able to boost the exactly solvable covariant bs model computation into the more phenomenologically accessible lfqm computation . in practice ,",
    "the lf vertex function obtained in the covariant bs model was mapped into the phenomenological , typically gaussian , lf trial wave function which has been scrutinized by the standard lfqm analysis of meson mass spectroscopy based on the variational principle and other meson phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable finding from this practice was that the zero - mode contribution as well as the instantaneous contribution revealed in the covariant bs model became absent in the lfqm with the lf on - mass - shell constituent quark and antiquark degrees of freedom . without involving the zero - mode and instantaneous contributions , our lfqm with the gaussian trial wave function provided the result of twist-3 das @xmath0 and @xmath11 which not only satisfied the fundamental constraint ( i.e. , symmetric form with respect to @xmath15 ) anticipated from the isospin symmetry but also provided the consistency both with the chiral symmetry and the conformal symmetry ( e.g. , the correct asymptotic form in the @xmath16 limit ) expected from the qcd .",
    "our lfqm predictions with the gaussian wave function such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 $ ] for @xmath13 and @xmath19 for @xmath12 in the chiral symmetry limit reproduce the exact functional forms anticipated from qcd s conformal limit  @xcite .",
    "this exemplifies that our lfqm prediction with the gaussian wave function satisfies both the chiral symmetry and the conformal symmetry consistent with the qcd if one correctly implements the zero - mode link to the qcd vacuum .",
    "it is important , however , to realize that satisfying both the chiral symmetry and the conformal symmetry depends on the choice of the lf trial wave function .",
    "the key in the gaussian lf wave function is the factorization of the transverse momentum dependence from the dependence of scale independent parameters such as mass .",
    "it allows that the @xmath16 limit satisfies both the chiral symmetry and the conformal symmetry simultaneously .",
    "if the lf trial wave function is not taken as gaussian but for example taken as power - law ( pl ) type , then the factorization of the transverse momentum dependence from the scale independent parameter dependence can not be fulfilled and thus the @xmath16 limit may not satisfy the conformal symmetry although it may still satisfy the chiral symmetry .",
    "this dependence on the lf trial wave function indicates that some particular meson das may not satisfy the conformal symmetry while they still satisfy the chiral symmetry consistent with qcd .",
    "similarly , the dse approach in  @xcite provided the asymptotic form of the pion @xmath20 with a broad downward concave shape in the central region of @xmath15 rather than @xmath19 anticipated from qcd s conformal limit  @xcite .",
    "there are two independent two - particle twist-3 das of a pseudoscalar meson , namely , pseudoscalar da @xmath21 and pseudotensor da @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite also analyzed the pseudotensor da @xmath1 , and found that the asymptotic form of the pion @xmath23 coincide with the anticipated expression of qcd s conformal limit , @xmath24 .",
    "these developments motivate our present work for the more - in - depth analysis of the two - particle twist-3 pion and kaon das in lfqm with different forms of lf trial wave functions .",
    "we first extend our previous work  @xcite to analyze the twist-3 pseudotensor da @xmath1 of a pseudoscalar meson within the lfqm .",
    "we also discuss the discrepancy of the asymptotic forms of @xmath20 between dse approach  @xcite and qcd s conformal limit expression  @xcite from the perspective of dependence of da on the form of lf trial wave functions such as gaussian wave function vs. pl wave function .",
    "although the two - particle twist-3 pion das were briefly discussed in lc2016  @xcite , we elaborate more in this work on the dependence of da on the form of lf trial wave functions as well as the su(3 ) flavor - symmetry breaking effect through the complete analysis of two - particle twist-3 das of pseudoscalar meson . in order to compute the twist-3 pseudotensor da @xmath1",
    ", we again utilize the same manifestly covariant bs model used in  @xcite to check the existence ( or absence ) of the lf zero - mode contribution .",
    "we then apply the previously found universal mapping [ see e.g. eq . ( 35 ) in  @xcite ] between the covariant bs model and the standard lfqm to map the vertex function obtained in the exactly solvable covariant bs model into the more phenomenologically accessible gaussian and pl radial wave functions provided from our lfqm variational principle computation .",
