    "the strong couplings among soft qcd gluons manifest themselves in a variety of complex long - distance phenomena .",
    "most of them are thoroughly entwined with the vacuum state , as illustrated by such prominent examples as quark confinement , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , vacuum tunneling processes , the ensuing @xmath0 structure as well as large gluon condensates . despite the apparent diversity of these and other effects",
    ", however , the essence of the underlying dynamics is often expected to involve just a few soft gluonic modes .",
    "the quest for these long - wavelength excitations began shortly after the inception of qcd and has inspired the development of various kinds of vacuum models , based e.g. on glueball condensation @xcite , gaussian stochastic processes @xcite , gluonic domains @xcite and instanton @xcite as well as meron @xcite ensembles . over the last decade , lattice simulations increasingly assisted in the search for predominant infrared ( ir ) gluon fields , mostly by means of numerical `` filtering '' @xcite and gauge - fixing @xcite techniques .",
    "these simulations are now beginning to generate quantitative insights into the role of instantons and their size distribution @xcite , and into the classic confinement scenarios based on ( gauge - projected abelian ) monopole @xcite or center vortex @xcite condensation .",
    "nevertheless , at present no mechanism involving soft vacuum gluons can be uniquely or systematically related to qcd , and many crucial questions regarding the underlying fields , their stability , gauge - independent physical interpretation , mutual interactions , relations to other vacuum fields etc .",
    "remain unanswered .",
    "analytical progress in this realm has been particularly slowed by the inevitable gauge dependence of the generally rather complex classical gluon field configurations on which most of the existing proposals are based .",
    "similarly , approaches which reformulate non - abelian gauge theory in terms of gauge - independent loop variables @xcite or resolve the gauge constraints explicitly ( e.g. in coulomb gauge @xcite ) , are often technically too involved for direct practical applications .    in the present paper",
    ", we circumvent such complications by developing an approach in which not the contributions of single gauge fields but rather those of gauge invariant classes are treated jointly .",
    "these classes gather contributions from dominant gauge field orbits to low - energy yang - mills amplitudes and thus represent collective gluonic ir degrees of freedom . technically , they are the saddle points of a soft mode action for gauge invariant matrix fields and therefore also provide the principal input for a systematic saddle point expansion of soft yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "manifest gauge invariance is maintained throughout all calculations by working in the hamiltonian formulation of yang - mills theory in the `` coordinate '' schrdinger representation and by making use of explicit gauge projection operators . the schrdinger picture is adopted mainly because it restricts gauge transformations to a fixed reference time , thereby effectively decoupling them from the dynamical time evolution , and because it often renders the impact of topological gluon properties particularly transparent ( even without recourse to the semi - classical approximation ) @xcite .",
    "for the reasons already alluded to , we will focus on gluonic effects and work in pure gauge theory without quarks .",
    "the individual ir  degrees of freedom , i.e. the solutions of the saddle point equations , turn out to comprise a diverse range of specific features .",
    "additionally , they have several important properties in common , including stability against scale transformations ( an indispensable prerequisite for the saddle point expansion which is ensured by a virial theorem ) and characteristic topological properties inherited from the gauge group .",
    "the topology will turn out to be particularly useful for establishing relations between specific saddle - point families and the instanton and meron solutions of the classical yang - mills equation .",
    "our approach maintains explicitly traceable links between the soft collective  fields and the underlying gluon fields .",
    "the resulting ir dynamics is at an intermediate level of complexity , somewhere inbetween the microscopic theory itself and effective theories ( e.g. for polyakov loops ) which just share the symmetries of the fundamental dynamics while coupling parameters have to be fitted to experimental ( or lattice ) data .",
    "our soft - mode lagrangian , in contrast , follows uniquely from the adopted vacuum wave functional and combines a reasonable amount of transparency with accessibility to essentially analytical treatment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ voa ] we recapitulate the definition of the vacuum overlap amplitude in the schrdinger picture .",
    "we then implement a gauge - projected vacuum wave functional on the basis of the gaussian approximation and rewrite the overlap in terms of a bare action which had previously emerged in a variational context . in sec .",
    "[ sge ] , we take advantage of known 1-loop results to integrate out the hard - mode contributions to the bare action perturbatively . by means of a controlled derivative expansion , the renormalized soft - mode action density",
    "is then transformed it into a local lagrangian which lends itself to direct analytical treatment . in sec .",
    "[ spex ] we build on these results by establishing the ir - sensitive saddle point expansion for the functional integral over the soft modes and by deriving the saddle point equations whose  nontrivial  solutions constitute the new gluonic ir degrees of freedom .    important generic properties of these ir variables are established in sec .",
    "[ sps ] , including their scale stability due to a virial theorem , three topological quantum numbers and a lower bound of bogomolnyi type on their action . in sec .",
    "[ solncl ] , several classes of the more symmetric and most important saddle point  solutions are found explicitly .",
    "they comprise topological soliton solutions of hedgehog type , which are related to classical solutions of the yang - mills equation , and solutions which carry different types of topological information and seem to have no obvious counterparts in classical yang - mills theory .",
    "one of the most interesting solution classes consists of solitonic links , twisted links and knots .",
    "those emerge from a generalization of faddeev - niemi theory which turns out to be embedded in our soft - mode lagrangian . in sec .",
    "[ qspi ] we classify all hedgehog soliton solutions , find their most important representatives explicitly , and establish the role of the regular solutions as mainly summarizing contributions from instanton and meron gauge orbits to the vacuum overlap . in sec .",

    "[ hhtype ] . according to this analogy",
    ", the instanton classes correspond to exactly @xmath8 full turns of the pendulum , where the sign of @xmath8 indicates the direction of the rotation .",
    "the pendulum mass starts in the unstable equilibrium position at time @xmath362 with just enough initial speed @xmath363 to finally end up there again for @xmath364 .",
    "this analogy implies , in particular , that there is exactly one regular hedgehog solution for each integer @xmath8 and that the constant @xmath365 is the only regular solution with @xmath179 .",
    "the meron class solutions start from the unstable equilibrium position as well .",
    "however , their initial velocity @xmath343 is insufficient for completing all turns in full .",
    "the last turn remains uncompleted , i.e. the pendulum swings back , oscillates around and finally settles into the stable equilibrium position .",
    "hence all meron class solutions have half - integer @xmath8 and are non - monotonic .    for the irregular solutions , on the other hand , the pendulum starts at the stable equilibrium position @xmath279 .",
    "when not provided with sufficient initial speed @xmath343 to complete a full turn , it just performs damped oscillations around @xmath279 .",
    "the corresponding solution has @xmath179 and is depicted in fig .",
    "5 . when @xmath366 is sufficiently large , however , the pendulum can perform @xmath8 full turns before settling into the stable equilibrium position . as a consequence , all these solutions have integer @xmath190 and infinite action ( cf . eq .",
    "( [ lrad ] ) ) .",
    "pursuing the analogy further , one would also expect irregular solutions which have an initial value @xmath299 exactly as needed to end up at the unstable equilibrium position when @xmath270 ( after possibly completing a number of full turns ) .",
    "such configurations would carry a half - integer topologically charge @xmath8 and a finite action .",
    "for obvious reasons they turn out to be highly sensitive to variations of the initial condition , however , and therefore difficult to establish numerically .",
    "in contrast to the instanton and meron classes , the singular hedgehog solutions do not seem to have obvious analogs among the solutions of the classical yang - mills equation .",
    "as opposed to the instanton ( meron ) classes , furthermore , the irregular integer-@xmath8 ( half - integer-@xmath8 ) solutions have infinite ( finite ) action .",
    "this allows for nontrivial hedgehog solutions with @xmath179 , which are necessarily irregular at the origin .",
    "the physical interpretation of all irregular hedgehog solutions and their relevance for the saddle point expansion remain to be clarified .",
    "the main results of this paper are a practicable saddle point expansion for the yang - mills vacuum overlap amplitude in terms of gauge invariant , local matrix fields and the identification of new gluonic ir degrees of freedom in this framework . after adopting a gauge - projected gaussian approximation to the vacuum wave functional ,",
    "the ir degrees of freedom can be obtained explicitly as the saddle points of a soft - mode action which gather contributions from dominant gluon field families to soft yang - mills amplitudes and thus represent collective properties of the yang - mills dynamics .",
    "since their gauge invariant definition makes no reference to specific amplitudes , furthermore , the ir degrees of freedom are universal .",
    "they provide both new structural insights into the organization of the low - energy yang - mills dynamics and the principal input for a systematic saddle point expansion of soft amplitudes .",
    "our survey of the saddle point solution space uncovered a diverse spectrum of ir degrees of freedom which carry several topological charges with associated bogomolnyi - type action bounds and obey a virial theorem which guarantees their scale stability .",
    "solutions with a relatively high degree of symmetry were obtained either analytically or with modest numerical effort . since solutions of this type",
    "are generally characterized by small action values and hence play a dominant role in the saddle point expansion , we have investigated their properties in some detail . besides translationally invariant vacua and analytical solutions with a fixed relative gauge orientation",
    ", we have found topological solitons of hedgehog , ( vortex ) link and knot types .",
    "some of the ir degrees of freedom have a transparent physical interpretation directly in terms of the underlying gluon fields .",
    "the contributions from the gauge orbits of yang - mills instanton and merons , in particular , are gathered by saddle point fields of hedgehog type which share their ( integer or half - integer ) topological charge and represent vacuum tunneling processes in the hamiltonian formulation of non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "although our saddle point solutions contain quantum effects and potentially relevant contributions from other gauge fields , those in the instanton class turn out to reproduce the relative gauge orientation between the in- and out - vacua of the yang - mills instanton rather closely .",
    "the finite extent of our meron solution classes , on the other hand , is generated by quantum effects which smoothen the singularities of the classical , pointlike yang - mills merons .",
    "nevertheless , our meron classes turn out to share the infinite action of their yang - mills counterparts .    among all those ir fields which carry one unit of topological ( instanton ) charge , the single ( anti- ) instanton classes",
    "are expected to attain the minimal action value . as a consequence of the action bound",
    ", they should therefore dominate the saddle point expansion in all topological charge sectors .",
    "similar configurations emerged in a variational treatment along with qualitative arguments in favor of their size stabilization . in our approach , this stabilization is manifest in the exact instanton class solutions themselves .",
    "in fact , their size turns out to be fixed at about twice the inverse ir gluon mass scale and agrees inside errors with instanton liquid model and lattice results . the underlying virial theorem and the soft gluon mass generation therefore provide new insight into the mechanism by which the chronic infrared diseases of dilute yang - mills instanton gases are overcome .",
    "the sizes of the meron class solutions with half - integer topological charge turn out to be of a more complex origin . besides the dynamical gluon mass they depend on a second , variable mass scale which is encoded in a boundary condition .",
    "hence meron classes exist within large and continuous size ranges and consequently form a far more extensive solution family than the instanton classes .",
    "this opens up the hypothetical  possibility for their entropy to overcome their infinite action suppression in functional integrals .",
    "such a mechanism would not only help to clarify the physical impact of our solutions but also shed new light on the still controversial role of the yang - mills merons themselves .",
    "in addition to the instanton and meron classes , finally , there exists a third class of hedgehog solutions which contains a monopole - type singularity at the origin .",
    "these irregular solutions can carry half - integer and integer ( including zero ) topological charges as well , and generally have infinite action .",
    "hence their potential physical relevance seems to depend on the existence  of additional mechanisms which could both smoothen their singularity and overcome their infinite - action suppression .",
    "several other remarkable families of ir degrees of freedom turn out to be represented by topological solitons of faddeev - niemi type , i.e. by ( potentially twisted ) links and knots .",
    "in fact , our saddle point dynamics  contains a specific generalization of the faddeev - niemi lagrangian and shows explicitly how it is embedded in the gaussian approximation to the yang - mills vacuum wave functional .",
    "this puts faddeev - niemi theory into a new perspective , as the effective  dynamics of dominant sets of gauge field orbits with a collective hopf charge , and provides the underlying unit - vector field with a manifestly gauge invariant meaning .",
    "the latter would well accord with the tentative interpretation of knot  solutions as glueballs by faddeev , niemi and coworkers .",
    "this and other interpretations could be tested in our framework by directly evaluating the impact of the knot saddle points on suitable amplitudes , e.g. on glueball correlation functions .    more generally , the saddle point expansion allows the systematic calculation of contributions from all relevant ir degrees of freedom to functional integrals which represent soft yang - mills amplitudes .",
    "first calculations of this type , focusing on fundamental vacuum properties including gluon condensates and the topological susceptibility , are underway .",
    "in addition , our approach makes it possible to analyze the gauge field content of any ir variable individually by applying standard functional techniques to the integrals over gluon fields with which they are associated .",
    "investigations of this sort would not only provide further structural insight into specific ir degrees of freedom and their physical role but may also shed new light on the dynamical mechanisms by which soft gauge fields organize themselves into collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the diverse topological properties of the ir variables demonstrate that the gauge - projected gaussian wave functional not only captures the homotopy  structure of the gauge group but also implements `` derivative '' topologies which further characterize the saddle point families .",
    "due to the typical robustness of such topological properties , the related results are expected to remain at least qualitatively valid beyond the gaussian approximation . moreover , the saddle point expansion engenders the means to test this expectation quantitatively , by mapping out limitations of the underlying vacuum wave functional in comparison with lattice data .",
    "extensions of our framework to suitable supersymmetric gauge theories would even permit analytical tests of this sort , e.g. by tracing vestiges of the monopole - based confinement mechanism in the vacuum functional .",
    "the insights gained from such investigations may also provide specific guidance for the development of improved collective - mode actions and consequently generate systematic corrections to the ir variables .",
    "our ir saddle point expansion can be extended in several directions .",
    "a first important task would be a more exhaustive survey of the saddle - point solution space which should encompass potentially relevant approximate solutions .",
    "the extension to qcd proper requires the generalization to the gauge group @xmath367 and the implementation of quarks into the gaussian wave functional , both of which pose no conceptual problems .",
    "most topological properties , in particular , reside in the trivially embedded @xmath368 subgroup of the full color group and will remain unchanged .",
    "a sufficiently complete treatment of the quark - gluon interactions and their impact on the effective action , however , appears to be more challenging .",
    "our approach opens up a variety of directions for future research .",
    "besides those already mentioned , it would for example be interesting to explore relations between the gauge - invariant ir degrees of freedom and gauge - dependent gluonic structures ( monopoles , vortices , branes etc . ) and amplitudes ( e.g. the 2-dimensional nonlocal gluon condensate and green functions )  which appear in gauge - fixed formulations .",
    "another useful endeavor would be the calculation of those higher - dimensional vacuum condensates which provide the principal input for the operator product expansion of glueball correlators .",
    "duality sum rules could then link the contributions from different ir degrees of freedom with the low - lying glueball spectrum @xcite , e.g. as a precursor and complement to a direct saddle - point evaluation of glueball correlation functions .    financial support by the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) of brazil as well as the hospitality and a visiting scientist grant of the ect * in trento ( italy ) are gratefully acknowledged .      1 .   an example of the @xmath369 solution class . as in all following figures , we display the solution at @xmath370 gev .",
    "other values of @xmath35 can immediately be accommodated by scaling the @xmath282-axis .",
