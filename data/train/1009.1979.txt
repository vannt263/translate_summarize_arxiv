    "non - gaussianity of primordial fluctuations is now one of the important observables to probe the physics of the early universe .",
    "although the inflaton , which acquires quantum fluctuations during inflation and generates ( almost ) scale - invariant and adiabatic primordial fluctuations , has been considered to be responsible for the origin of density fluctuations in the universe , this scenario might not be the one realized in the nature .",
    "primordial fluctuations generated from the inflaton during slow - roll inflation are expected to be almost gaussian , however , current observations such as wmap indicate that the primordial fluctuations might deviate from gaussian ones and the deviation could be relatively large compared to the one expected from the `` slow - rolling '' inflation models .",
    "( for recent analyses , see @xcite . )",
    "the degrees of non - gaussianity are often represented by a so - called non - linearity parameter @xmath8 , which characterizes the size of bispectrum of the curvature perturbation .",
    "depending on the momentum distribution of the bispectrum or the shape of three point function , three types of @xmath8 have been discussed in the literature  @xcite : local , equilateral and orthogonal types .",
    "the limits on these @xmath8s have been obtained as @xcite : @xmath9 for the local type , @xmath10 for the equilateral type and @xmath11 for the orthogonal type ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "although all of these are still consistent with gaussian fluctuations , they may give some hint of non - gaussian ones since the central value of @xmath8 for some types is away from the zero .",
    "if the primordial fluctuations are confirmed to be deviated from gaussian ones in the future , which may well be probed with more precise observations such as planck @xcite , fluctuations from the `` slow - rolling '' inflaton would be excluded at least as a dominant mechanism of the generation of density fluctuations .",
    "however , many other mechanisms have also been discussed in the literature and quite a few of them can generate large non - gaussianity .",
    "now we have plenty of models generating large non - gaussian primordial fluctuations .",
    "thus the question we should ask next is `` how can we differentiate these models ? '' in this paper , we discuss this issue by using bispectrum and trispectrum of the curvature perturbation .",
    "although , as mentioned above , we can divide models into some categories depending on the shape of the three point functions ( local , equilateral and orthogonal types ) , where scalar fields have some non - canonical kinetic terms  @xcite .",
    "the orthogonal - type @xmath12 approximately arises from a linear combination of higher - derivative scalar - field interaction terms  @xcite . ]",
    ", the shape is not enough to differentiate models since there remain many models for each type of the shape .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 predicted in those models can fall onto almost the same value by tuning some model parameters .",
    "thus , obviously , the determination of @xmath8 is not enough to pin down the models of large non - gaussianity even if @xmath8 is found to be large in the future .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to pursue the strategy of how one can differentiate models of large non - gaussianity . to this end , we consider higher order statistics such as the trispectrum in addition to the bispectrum @xcite . ] .",
    "the size of the trispectrum can be parametrized by other non - linearity parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath1 are given by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 c.l . ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath16 c.l . ) from cosmic microwave background observations  @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite also obtained @xmath18 ( @xmath16 c.l . ) from large scale structure observations by assuming that @xmath19 and @xmath20 . ] and the importance of the trispectrum has been emphasized in some literature @xcite . however , here we give a systematic study of the bispectrum and the trispectrum of models with large non - gaussianity and make some classifications by using the `` consistency relations '' between the non - linearity parameters @xmath21 and @xmath14 .    among three types mentioned above ( local , equilateral and orthogonal types ) , we focus on local - type models in this paper .",
    "as will be shown , by using the `` consistency relations , '' we may be able to discriminate models of large non - gaussianity .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the formalism for the discussion of local - type non - gaussianity of primordial fluctuations .",
    "then in section  [ sec : local ] , we first make a classification of models by using some relation between the non - linearity parameters @xmath22 and @xmath14 in a systematic manner .",
    "some example models will also be discussed .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and conclusion of this paper .",
    "first we summarize the formalism to discuss local - type non - gaussianity of primordial fluctuations , which is expected to be generated from super - horizon dynamics of curvature fluctuations .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt the @xmath23 formalism @xcite . in this formalism , the super - horizon scale curvature perturbation on the uniform energy density hypersurface @xmath24 at some time @xmath25 is given by the perturbation in the number of @xmath26-folding measured from the initial time @xmath27 to the time @xmath28 . here",
    "we take the initial time @xmath27 to be the time shortly after the horizon crossing and the initial hypersurface to be a flat one .",
    "then the curvature perturbation is given , up to the third order , as @xmath29 where a subscript @xmath30 and @xmath31 labels a scalar field , which is assumed to be gaussian fluctuations @xmath32 at @xmath33 in the following discussion , and @xmath34 and so on . the summation is implied for repeated indices .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath35 , bispectrum @xmath36 and trispectrum @xmath37 of the curvature perturbation are given by @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be written as @xmath41 with @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath1 are non - linearity parameters of the local type . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the power spectrum for fluctuations of a scalar field : @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the hubble parameter at @xmath33 .    since",
    "@xmath49 are gaussian fields , the leading order contributions to the bispectrum are given by four - point functions of @xmath49 .",
    "the next leading order contributions are given by six - point functions . as is explained in detail in @xcite",
    ", we can systematically classify those contributions by assigning a diagram to each contribution . in terms of the diagram approach ,",
    "the four - point function of @xmath49 is represented by the tree diagram and the six - point function by the diagram containing a single loop .",
    "this can be easily generalized to higher order correlation functions of @xmath24 ( and also to the power spectrum ) .",
    "the leading order contributions to the @xmath50-point function of @xmath24 are given by @xmath51-point function of @xmath49 , which are represented by the tree diagrams .",
    "the next leading order contributions are given by @xmath52-point function , which are represented by the one - loop diagrams .",
    "in many cases , the contributions from the loop diagrams are tiny and can be safely neglected .",
    "therefore , we first drop the loop corrections and consider only tree contributions .",
    "we will discuss a case in which effects from loop corrections can not be neglected in a later section and an appendix .    by calculating the bispectrum and the trispectrum at the tree level",
    ", we obtain the non - linearity parameters @xmath21 and @xmath14 as @xcite @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 in the following , since we concentrate on non - gaussianity of the local - type models , we omit a superscript `` local '' unless some confusions arise .",
    "even if we limit ourselves to models generating large local - type non - gaussianity , there still remain many possibilities . to discuss how we discriminate those models , here we classify the local - type models into some categories . for this purpose",
    ", we first give a particular attention to the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "notice that , when a single scalar field @xmath56 is only responsible for density fluctuations in the universe , @xmath23 formalism indicates : @xmath57 from these equations , we can easily find the following relation between @xmath8 and @xmath13 : @xmath58 since some simple models such as the pure curvaton and the pure modulated reheating scenarios fall onto this type , we use the above relation to make a classification .",
    "we call models in which eq",
    ".   is satisfied as `` single - source model . ''",
    "notice that @xmath13 is determined once @xmath8 is given in models of this class .",
    "the next category is for models which do not have a universal relation between @xmath8 and @xmath13 , although there exists an inequality as given below .",
    "this is a general situation where there are multiple sources of density fluctuations .",
    "thus we call this category `` multi - source model . ''",
    "an example of this type includes mixed fluctuation models , where fluctuations from both of the inflaton and another scalar field such as the curvaton can be responsible for density fluctuations . since the inflaton gives almost gaussian fluctuations , non - gaussianity mostly originates from fluctuations of the other source in such a case .",
    "the third category would be for models where there is some universal relation between @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , this definition includes models of the first class discussed above as a special case .",
    "however , the `` single source model '' is somewhat a very special type , and thus we treat them as a separate category .",
    "one of examples of this third category is so - called `` ungaussiton '' model @xcite , in which the relation @xmath59 holds . in this model ,",
    "the second order perturbation of the `` ungaussiton '' field dominates the linear order one .",
    "since the dominance of the second order perturbations indicates that the fluctuations are completely non - gaussian , we need another source which gives a gaussian perturbation at linear order .",
    "thus this model would require multi - sources of fluctuations in this sense .",
    "hence we call models in this third category `` constrained multi - source model . ''    here it is worth noting that the following inequality holds in the @xmath8@xmath13 plane : @xmath60 which can be obtained by using cauchy - schwarz inequality and was first found by two of the present authors ( t.s . and m.y . )",
    "the derivation of this inequality   in @xcite was based on the expressions for @xmath8 and @xmath13 given in eqs .   and , which are valid at the tree level .",
    "in this paper , we further show that , even when some loop corrections are dominant in @xmath8 and @xmath13 , the inequality   holds as far as loop contributions are subdominant in the power spectrum , which is required from current observations .",
    "since all models generating large local - type non - gaussianity known to date satisfy the above assumptions , the inequality   is very important to test the local - type models .",
    "thus we call the inequality   `` local - type inequality '' in the following .",
    "we discuss this issue in detail again in section  [ subsec : constrained ] . also notice that single - source models correspond to the boundary of this local - type inequality .    in the following sections , we discuss various models for each category .",
    "we start with `` single - source model , '' then discuss `` multi - source model '' and `` constrained multi - source model '' afterwards . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl_taunl ] , some models of these categories are shown in the `` @xmath8@xmath13 '' diagram , from which we can have some idea of to what extent models of each category can give different predictions on @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "we also give a summary of the categories and their examples in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "now we have categorized models of local - type into three classes by using the key quantity @xmath61 . however , since each category still includes some ( or many ) possible models , we may need another quantity to discriminate them . for this purpose",
    ", we can further utilize the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "although the @xmath8@xmath14 relation can change depending on the model parameters , we can roughly divide models into three types further by looking at their relative size . as we will argue in the following sections , the relation @xmath62 holds in some models , then we call such models `` linear @xmath14 type . ''",
    "in other models , @xmath14 could be suppressed compared to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath63 , which we denote this type of models as `` suppressed @xmath14 type . ''",
    "the other type is `` enhanced @xmath14 type '' in which the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath14 can be given as @xmath64 with @xmath65 ( but in most models discussed in this paper , @xmath66 ) . by using the @xmath8@xmath13 and @xmath8@xmath14 relations",

    "we look at some of models in this class more closely .      to make a prediction on the non - linearity parameters in the pure curvaton model @xcite ,",

    "also notice that the curvature perturbation induced from @xmath56 starts from the second order .",
    "hence the fluctuations from @xmath56 are completely non - gaussian , which can not explain the observed fluctuations .",

    "when the initial value ( the field value during inflation ) of the scalar field @xmath97 is less than its quantum fluctuation during inflation @xmath575 , models of this category can be easily realized such as in the axion , the curvaton , the modulated reheating and so on .      in this paper , we have discussed various models generating large local - type non - gaussianity focusing on models which can be accommodated in the framework of inflationary universe ( fluctuations originating to quantum fluctuations during inflation ) with adiabatic mode . however , there are other possibilities of generating large non - gaussianity in some other frameworks and/or models where a simple parametrization of the non - linearity parameters may not be adopted . here",

    "when one considers the generation of dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe , isocurvature perturbations can be generated in some situations . since the shapes of the bispectrum and the trispectrum are different from the counterparts of the adiabatic ones , a simple parametrization of @xmath21 and @xmath14 can not be easily compared with the ones defined for adiabatic fluctuations and @xmath576 . while the former is defined in eq .   and has been discussed in this paper , the latter is defined to parametrize non - gaussianity in models with isocurvature mode @xcite .",
    "we can estimate how large non - gaussianity from isocurvature fluctuations can be compared to the counterpart in adiabatic mode by using the relation between these non - linearity parameters derived in @xcite . ] .",

    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for the detailed discussion on this issue .",
    "another local - type model is so - called the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , in which the scale - invariant curvature perturbation and large non - gaussianity can be generated .",
    "the non - linearity parameters @xmath8 and @xmath14 in this models have been calculated and the relation between @xmath185 and @xmath14 is obtained as @xmath268 @xcite .",
    "there are also several studies on the possibility of generating large non - gaussianity during preheating phase  @xcite . in this case , the super - horizon scale fluctuations might be strongly coupled to the evolution of small scale fluctuations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have introduced a new parameter @xmath577 , which describes the non - linearity of the curvature perturbations and claimed that during preheating era there seems to be a possibility of generating large non - gaussianity whose form is quite different from the usual local - type non - gaussianity .",
    "another possibility of local - type non - gaussianity we would like to mention is a model in which the @xmath26-folding number is quite sensitive to the field value .",
    "in such a case , the truncation at the leading order or at the next leading order of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltan ] ) will no longer give a correct answer .",
    "we then need to go to the higher order calculations until the series converge or to resort to the full order calculations . in appendix",
    "[ app:2 ] , we give a simple toy model belonging to this class and briefly discuss some interesting features of the bispectrum and trispectrum .",
    "in this paper , we made a classification of models generating large local - type non - gaussianity by using some consistency relations between the non - linearity parameters @xmath22 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first key relation is the ratio of @xmath61 , by which we classify local - type models into three categories :    * single - source model ( @xmath578 ) * multi - source model ( @xmath579 ) * constrained multi - source model ( @xmath580 )    we have also shown that the `` local - type inequality '' @xmath581 holds true not only for the case where the tree level contribution dominates in the non - linearity parameters but also for the case where the loop contribution dominates there .",
    "this inequality has been shown under the condition that a loop contribution is subdominant in the power spectrum , which is required by current observations . to our knowledge , since all models generating local - type large non - gaussianity known today should satisfy the `` local - type inequality , '' if future observations confirm that this inequality does not hold , local - type models would be practically ruled out as a mechanism of generating large non - gaussian primordial fluctuations .    on the other hand ,",
    "if future observations find large @xmath8 of local type and probe the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath8 with some accuracy , satisfying the local - type inequality , we can see what category of models would be favored .",
    "however , even if we can pick up the one of these categories , as we have discussed , there still remain many possibilities for each .",
    "thus we need a further classification to pin down the model of large non - gaussianity . for this purpose",
    ", we can make use of the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "we have shown that models can be further divided into three types according to the relative size of @xmath14 compared to that of @xmath8 as follows :    * suppressed @xmath14 type ( @xmath582}\\times f_{\\rm nl}$ ] ) * linear @xmath14 type ( @xmath583 ) * enhanced @xmath14 type ( @xmath584 with @xmath65 or @xmath66 for many models )    thus if we further probe the relation @xmath8 and @xmath14 in future observations , we may find that only a few models survive by using the above categorizations .",
    "then we can figure out what type of models are favored as a mechanism of the generation of primordial fluctuations .",
    "we have also worked out the above mentioned relations for various concrete models in this paper .",
    "although models can be categorized rather rigorously by using the ratio @xmath585 , the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath14 can significantly differ depending on some model parameters , in particular , in multi - source models .",
    "for example , let us take the multi - brid inflation model with quadratic potential , which was discussed in section  [ subsec : multi_brid ] .",
    "this model predicts that @xmath586 with being @xmath214 a slow - roll parameter , which is of the suppressed @xmath14 type , for the equal mass case , while the relation becomes @xmath587 , which is of the enhanced @xmath14 type , for the large mass ratio case . in other words ,",
    "the relation between @xmath314 and @xmath14 should be carefully investigated to discriminate a model because a model can predict quite different relations depending on its model parameters .",
    "however , it also means that the relation would be useful to explore the parameters of a model .    in this paper , we have focused on non - gaussianity in various models and not discussed much the tensor - to - scalar ratio or gravitational waves . in most models where large non - gaussian primordial fluctuations are generated ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is considered to be very small in general . however , there are a few examples which can give a relatively large tensor - to - scalar ratio as well as generating large non - gaussianity .",
    "one of such examples is a mixed model of inflaton fluctuations with some other source discussed in section  [ sec : mixed_inf ] . in this model ,",
    "the fluctuations from the inflaton can also be responsible for the curvature perturbation , and in such a case , the tensor - to - scalar ratio can be large , which could be detectable in near future observations .",
    "another example is multi - brid inflation model discussed in section  [ subsec : multi_brid ] .",
    "if both the tensor - to - scalar ratio and non - gaussianity are found to be large in the future , above mentioned models may become the target of detailed studies .",
    "this illustrates that a comprehensive investigation using non - gaussianity and some other information such as gravitational waves can give much insight into the pursuit of the generation mechanism of primordial fluctuations .",
    "if three non - linearity parameters @xmath21 and @xmath14 are well determined in future observations , we may be able to pin down the model of large non - gaussianity and pick up a right model of generating primordial fluctuations .",
    "the classification by using the consistency relation among the above three parameters would be very useful to pursue the origin of the structure of the universe and give a deep understanding of the early universe .",

    "nevertheless , we can derive some interesting consequences from these results , as we will see below .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath26-folding number depends on a field @xmath56 by @xmath605 where @xmath606 denotes the spatial average .",

    "<S> we classify models generating large local - type non - gaussianity into some categories by using some `` consistency relations '' among the non - linearity parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which characterize the size of bispectrum for the former and trispectrum for the later two . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss how one can discriminate models of large local - type non - gaussianity with such relations . </S>",
