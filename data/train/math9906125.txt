    "one can show , that the projections of the two circles of @xmath104 can be assumed to be direct tangent ( at the base point ) under this homotopy .",
    "clearly the only moves needed for this homotopy are @xmath396 ( see figure  [ moves1.fig ] ) , @xmath397 ( see figure  [ moves2.fig ] ) and their inverses .",

    "an extra kink located on a loop of @xmath355 corresponds ( under the lifting of the loop to a loop in @xmath77 ) to the multiplication by the class of an oriented fiber of @xmath210 .",
