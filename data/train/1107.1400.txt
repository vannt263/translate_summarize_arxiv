    "linearly polarized gluons in an unpolarized hadron , carrying a light - cone momentum fraction @xmath2 and transverse momentum @xmath3 w.r.t .  to the parent s momentum , are described by the transverse momentum dependent distribution ( tmd ) @xmath4 @xcite . unlike the quark tmd @xmath5 of transversely polarized quarks inside an unpolarized hadron ( also frequently referred to as boer - mulders function ) @xcite , @xmath6 is chiral - even and @xmath7-even .",
    "this means it does not require initial or final state interactions ( isi / fsi ) to be nonzero . nevertheless",
    ", as any tmd , @xmath8 can receive contributions from isi or fsi and therefore can be process dependent , in other words , non - universal , and its extraction can be hampered in nonfactorizing cases .    thus far",
    "no experimental studies of @xmath9 have been performed .",
    "as recently pointed out , it is possible to obtain an extraction of @xmath8 in a simple and theoretically safe manner , since unlike @xmath10 it does not need to appear in pairs @xcite . here",
    "we will discuss observables that involve only a single @xmath8 in semi - inclusive dis to two heavy quarks or to two jets , which allow for tmd factorization and hence a safe extraction .",
    "the corresponding hadroproduction processes run into the problem of factorization breaking @xcite .",
    "we first consider heavy quark ( hq ) production , @xmath11+@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14+@xmath15+@xmath16+@xmath17 , where the four - momenta of the particles are given within brackets , and the heavy quark - antiquark pair in the final state is almost back - to - back in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the exchanged photon and hadron .",
    "we look at the heavy quarks created in the photon - gluon fusion process , which can be distinguished kinematically from intrinsic charm production ; e.g. , from the @xmath18 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the calculation proceeds along the lines explained in refs .",
    "we obtain for the cross section integrated over the angular distribution of the back - scattered electron @xmath14 : @xmath19 this expression involves the standard dis variables : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , we have for the hq transverse momenta @xmath24 and introduced the rapidities @xmath25 for the hq momenta ( along photon - target direction ) .",
    "we denote the proton mass with @xmath26 and the heavy ( anti)quark mass with @xmath27 . for the partonic subprocess we have @xmath28 , implying @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "we introduced the sum and difference of the hq transverse momenta , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , considering @xmath33 .",
    "in that situation , we can use the approximate hq transverse momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 denoting @xmath36 .",
    "the azimuthal angles of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , and @xmath41 .",
    "the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 depend on @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the angular independent part @xmath42 is non negative and involves only the unpolarized tmd gluon distribution @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "we focus on the magnitude @xmath43 of the @xmath48 asymmetry , which is determined by @xmath8 .",
    "namely , @xmath49 with @xmath50    \\frac{q^2}{m_\\perp^2 } + 2 \\,\\frac{m_q^2}{m_\\perp^2}\\right \\}~ , \\label{eq : bqqb2}\\ ] ] @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53/a(y)$ ] .",
    "since @xmath8 is completely unknown , we estimate the maximum asymmetry that is allowed by the bound @xmath54 where the superscript @xmath55 denotes the @xmath56 transverse moment ( defined as @xmath57 ) . the function @xmath58 , defined as the upper bound of the absolute value of @xmath59 , @xmath60 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asy ] as a function of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 1 gev ) at different values of @xmath63 for charm ( left panel ) and bottom ( right panel ) production .",
    "we have selected @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and taken @xmath66 2 gev@xmath67 , @xmath68 25 gev@xmath67 .",
    "such large asymmetries would probably allow an extraction of @xmath8 at eic ( or lhec ) .",
    "defined in eq .   as a function of @xmath69 at different values of @xmath63 , with @xmath70 and @xmath65 .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asy ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    defined in eq .   as a function of @xmath69 at different values of @xmath63 , with @xmath70 and @xmath65 .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asy ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , but for the upper bound @xmath71 of @xmath72 .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asyp],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] , but for the upper bound @xmath71 of @xmath72 .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asyp],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if one keeps the lepton plane angle @xmath73 , there are other azimuthal dependences , such as a @xmath74 .",
    "the bound on @xmath75 , denoted as @xmath71 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asyp ] in the same kinematic region as in fig .",
    "[ bbmpfig : asy ] .",
    "one can see that @xmath71 can be larger than @xmath58 , but only at smaller @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath71 falls off more rapidly at larger values of @xmath76 than @xmath58 .",
    "we note that it is essential that the individual transverse momenta @xmath77 are reconstructed with an accuracy @xmath78 better than the magnitude of the sum of the transverse momenta @xmath79 .",
    "this means one has to satisfy @xmath80 , which will require a minimum @xmath81 .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath82 can be calculated in a similar way and is analogous to eq .   .",
    "in particular , the explicit expression for @xmath43 can be obtained from the one for hq production taking @xmath83 , while @xmath42 now depends also on @xmath84 and receives a contribution from the subprocess @xmath85 as well , not just from @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the maximal asymmetries ( not shown ) are smaller than for hq pair production .",
    "studies of the azimuthal asymmetry of jet or heavy quark pair production in @xmath87 collisions can directly probe @xmath8 , the distribution of linearly polarized gluons inside unpolarized hadrons .",
    "breaking of tmd factorization is expected in @xmath88 or @xmath89 collisions , hence a comparison between extractions from these two types of processes would clearly signal the dependence on isi / fsi .",
    "the contribution of @xmath8 to diphoton production has also been studied @xcite .",
    "since the proposed measurements are relatively simple ( polarized beams are not required ) , we believe that the experimental determination of @xmath8 and the analysis of its potential process dependence will be feasible in the future .    c.p .",
