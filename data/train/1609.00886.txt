    "<S> [ setup](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> initially , a strip takes a planar elastica , but upon further pushing , its free tip may slip [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the slip is opposite to the direction of the initial buckling ( determined by spontaneous symmetry breaking ) , as it occurs to reduce the curvatures of the strip . despite the familiarity , simplicity , and fundamental importance of this prototypical phenomenon , its underlying physics remains unclear thus far . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when and how does the strip slip , and what determines the slip lengths as well as shapes of elastica ? to answer these basic questions , it is necessary to disentangle the complex interplay between the elasticity , geometry , friction , and gravity .    in this letter , we systematically study the problem outlined above using numerical and analytical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the frictional interaction between a strip s tip and a substrate surface is modeled according to the coulomb  </S>",

    "<S> this feature is characteristic of our system and differs from the behavior in a standard setup employed in previous elastica problems . </S>",
    "<S> first , we numerically investigate planar deformations of an elastica by changing the values of @xmath2 and the height of the strip @xmath3 in the absence of gravity , which are classified into three distinct states explained in detail below . an analytic model based on geometrically exact kirchhoff rod equations combined with the static friction law </S>",
    "<S> is then developed , which accurately predicts the onset of slip events observed in the numerical simulations . </S>",

    "<S> the centerline of the strip is discretized into a chain of @xmath4 spheres with a bond length @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> as we are interested only in the equilibrium shape , the position of each sphere , @xmath6 for @xmath7 , evolves according to the overdamped equations of motion with an effective friction constant @xmath8 given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the sum of the stretching and bending elastic forces , the force from the substrate , and the gravitational force , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the top end of the strip is clamped ; i.e. , its position is fixed , and its tangent is also fixed so that it is directed along the vertical ( @xmath14 ) axis . </S>",
    "<S> when the strip s tip is in contact with the substrate , the tip experiences forces and moments from the substrate but otherwise is free . </S>",

    "<S> [ sche_rod_bend_his](d ) shows that the trajectory of @xmath84 in the pulling ( reverse ) process differs considerably from that in the pushing process , revealing a distinct hysteresis in the cyclic process . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the strip never returns to the p configuration in the pulling process . </S>",
    "<S> such protocol - dependent hysteretic behavior is a direct consequence of the friction law and has also been found in granular experiments with dry frictions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ -effect of gravity : _ now we discuss the effect of gravity by changing @xmath43 while fixing @xmath85 so that the strip is in the p configuration for @xmath86 . as @xmath43 is increased , the strip tends to sag [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gravity_fig](a),(b ) ] . for @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , when the bending is comparable to the gravity , the free end easily slips because gravity increases @xmath76 , and the horizontal force @xmath88 also increases . </S>",
    "<S> however , the shape is distinct from that of the cs state because the strip interacts with the substrate by areal contact rather than point contact . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath43 becomes larger [ @xmath89 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gravity_fig](c ) ] , the strip folds and loops back on itself . this folding is analogous to the planar version of an elastic rope coiling . </S>",
    "<S> actually , using the same parameter set , we can reproduce a realistic coiling shape in our three - dimensional simulation of a twistless elastic string [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gravity_fig](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our investigation here manifests the following physical scenario about the initiation of the coiling . </S>",
    "<S> first , the free end slips partially immediately upon contact with the substrate ; subsequently , the contact length increases monotonically as the string sags , which significantly reduces the tangential tension and prevents the string from slipping further . </S>",
    "<S> this effectively confines the sagging string at a localized place , eventually leading to the characteristic coiling .    </S>",
    "<S> _ -conclusion : _ we investigated the planar slip configurations of an elastic strip pushed onto a frictional rigid substrate . combining numerical and analytical approaches , we revealed the fundamental aspects of this problem in the limit of weak gravity and quantified the relative importance of the geometry , elasticity , friction , and gravity . </S>",
    "<S> our framework may have a number of practical applications , such as selecting an optimal stiffness of brushes for a scratchless wash or a better toothbrush design , as well as those listed in the introduction . in closing </S>",
    "<S> , we note the key role of the asymmetry in the boundary condition used ( i.e. , clamped  hinged ) . </S>",
    "<S> slip occurs because of a nonzero @xmath88 , which naturally arises from ( and only from ) the mixed asymmetric boundary condition . under any symmetric boundary condition such as hinged  hinged , </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath90 at equilibrium by symmetry ; therefore , no slip event is predicted within inextensible continuum theory . in reality , the elastica could slip even in such a case if a pinned configuration is mechanically unstable to disturbances or if the elastica is extensible . </S>",
    "<S> this stability problem is beyond the scope of the present study but will definitely be an intriguing future subject .    </S>",
