    "the study of the temporal variability of time series in various branches of science and engineering has propelled the development of several techniques , both in frequency and time domains .",
    "variability studies in the case of astronomical sources are crucial to gain insight over the dynamical and microphysical timescales , and therefore on the size of the emitting region as well as the nature itself of the emission process .",
    "this is of key importance in the x and @xmath3ray domain , where remarkable flux variations are observed over timescales from days to ms .",
    "fourier techniques are widely used in this field , as witnessed by the popular timing analysis package xronos @xcite included in the nasa heasoft package .",
    "the fourier spectral analysis is fundamental in the study of stationary processes , since it provides an immediate physical interpretation as a power - frequency distribution .",
    "the fourier power density spectrum ( hereafter , pds ) in particular decomposes the total variance of a given time series to the different frequencies thanks to parseval s theorem ( e.g. , @xcite ; hereafter , k88 ) .",
    "pds analysis and related tools are suitable to both searching for possible periodic signals hidden in the data , and to characterising the so - called `` red noise '' connected with the presence of aperiodic variability .",
    "practically , in the most general case one divides the time series in multiple adjacent intervals , over which the corresponding pds is calculated .",
    "finally , for each frequency bin the resulting pds value and uncertainty are the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding power distribution , as is routinely done by the dedicated xronos tool powspec @xcite . however , the fundamental assumption behind this procedure is that each time interval represents a different sampling of the _ same _ stochastic stationary process .",
    "the operation of replacing ensemble averages with time averages of a single realisation makes sense only if the process is ergodic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "astronomical x  ray data rely on photon counting instruments . as such , measurement uncertainties",
    "are often dominated by the photon counting statistics , i.e. the poisson distribution .",
    "this translates into white noise in the pds ; adopting the normalisation introduced by @xcite ( hereafter l83 ) , the power is known to follow a @xmath4 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom ( @xmath0 ) .    when additional , genuine variability of the source is also present , the resulting power distribution changes correspondingly .",
    "for instance , there is a class of x  ray sources , such as cyg  x1 , whose time series are the result of a process characterised by source  intrinsic correlated noise , for which time averages of pdss from individual intervals are still meaningful .",
    "these time series belong to a class of random processes whose pds is still compatible with a rescaled @xmath0 distribution ( k88 ; @xcite ) .    in the case of",
    "highly nonstationary and short  lived events such as gamma",
    " ray bursts ( grbs ) , the problem of a proper treatment of the fourier pds requires particular care . dividing the light curve of a single grb into several sub ",
    "intervals , and deriving an average pds does not make any physical sense , given that the phenomenon is everything but stationary .",
    "therefore , only a single sample pds can be calculated over the entire observation duration . in these cases",
    "the statistical distribution of the pds remains to be determined in the more general case of red deterministic variability due to the source .",
    "one has then to be careful with assuming the 100% uncertainties on the pds provided by standard tools such as powspec : indeed , this relies on the @xmath0 distribution , which does not hold any more in the more general case of a variable source with red noise .    in the grb literature",
    ", there have been different approaches . in one case , if one considers a set of different time series due to _ different _ grbs as many realisations of the same stochastic process , then averaging the pds of different grbs still make sense .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that a strong assumption lies behind this : i.e. , there is a unique stochastic process giving rise to the variety of observed grb time profiles .",
    "this way one gains insight into the properties of this general process , whose pds is found to be described with a power ",
    "law , pds @xmath5 @xcite . in the other case ,",
    "each grb time profile is considered individually as the unique sample of a unique stochastic process , which is different from other grbs .",
    "the statistics of its unique pds is not known and is no more a @xmath0 .",
    "monte carlo simulations aimed at estimating the pds uncertainties by generating other ( synthetic ) samples of the same process can not make use of the observed sample curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , such a procedure increases the noise variance and changes the @xmath0 nature itself of the power distribution . in this work",
    "we address the issue of a correct evaluation of the statistics of the pds , and in particular of the power uncertainties , for a single sample of a nonstationary and short  lived signal , such as that of grb time profiles . in this work time series",
    "are meant to be deterministic profiles affected by uncorrelated noise .",
    "we derived a formula for the variance of the pds and show that it agrees with the known results of l83 in the pure white noise case .",
    "finally , we test the validity of our results in the case of synthetic light curves of typical grbs .    hereafter , time series are assumed to be discrete , equispaced , and with no data gaps .",
    "our treatment assumes the noise to be purely statistical and uncorrelated , and we consider the two cases of poisson or gaussian statistics , suitable to photon counting detectors .",
    "pdss are calculated assuming the leahy normalisation ( l83 )",
    ". we therefore neglect dead time effects , which are known to affect the statistics and suppress the variance of the resulting time series ( e.g. , @xcite , k88 ) .",
    "let @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) be a time series observed within a time window with a duration @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding bin times are @xmath9 .",
    "the observed series represents a sample function of the true time series we would have observed in the absence of statistical noise ( e.g. , with an infinite collecting area detector ) .",
    "hereafter , random variables are written in bold .",
    "each @xmath6 is therefore a single sample of the random variable @xmath10 , whose expected value and variance are defined as @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the random variables are assumed to be independent , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "the highest frequency is the nyquist frequency , @xmath18 . in the leahy normalisation",
    "the power spectrum is defined by @xmath19 or , equivalently , @xmath20 @xmath21 , is the expected total variance . as shown in section  [ sec : app_b ] , this happens to coincide with the total number of counts in the specific case of poisson statistics , which explains the reason for the choice of this name . from equation  ( [ eq : p1 ] ) the expected value of the random variable @xmath22",
    "is derived straightaway , and is @xmath23 where we used @xmath24 .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : exp_p ] ) accounts for the statistical noise variance , also called `` white '' because it does not depend on frequency .",
    "when the signal is constant , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath22 @xmath27 is known to be @xmath0 distributed , except for the nyquist frequency , for which @xmath28 is @xmath29 distributed and must be treated separately ( l83 ) . in the pure white noise case",
    "the second term vanishes , thus leaving @xmath30 .    in general , the second term can also be seen as the dft of the autocorrelation function ( acf ) defined by @xmath31 assuming the periodic boundary condition @xmath32 .",
    "this is the discrete version of the wiener ",
    "khinchin theorem stating that the power spectrum of a time series is the fourier transform of its acf ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we define the power density spectrum of the deterministic function @xmath33 by @xmath34 so that equation  ( [ eq : exp_p ] ) can be written as @xmath35 so far no assumption was made on the kind of the distribution of the random variables @xmath10 .",
    "hereafter , we distinguish between the gaussian and the poisson noise cases .",

    "is correct under the assumption that all power is due to poisson noise and intrinsic correlated noise , in the case of uncorrelated noise here considered from equation  ( [ eq : var_p2 ] ) the uncertainty is given by @xmath70 , and not @xmath71 .",
