    "it is well - known that photons radiated off from electrons can carry linear polarization . in terms of photon helicity , it corresponds to an interference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 helicity states .",
    "formally one can view this momentum dependent photon distribution as the distribution of linearly polarized photons ` inside ' an electron .",
    "similarly , there are distributions of linearly polarized photons and gluons inside a proton , here denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the latter has received growing attention recently , because it affects high energy collisions involving unpolarized protons , such as at lhc .",
    "the distribution of linearly polarized gluons inside an unpolarized hadron was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and later discussed in a model context in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that it contributes to the dijet imbalance in unpolarized hadronic collisions , which is commonly used to determine the average transverse momentum squared ( @xmath4 ) of partons inside protons .",
    "depending on the size of @xmath3 and on whether its contribution can be calculated and taken into account , it may complicate or even hamper the determination of the average transverse momentum of partons .",
    "it is therefore important to determine its size separately using other observables .",
    "although in ref .",
    "@xcite it was discussed how to isolate the contribution from @xmath3 by means of an azimuthal angular dependent weighting of the cross section , proton - proton collisions are expected to suffer from contributions that break factorization , through initial and final state interactions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a theoretically cleaner and safer way was considered : heavy quark pair production in electron - proton collisions , for instance at a future electron - ion collider .",
    "another process , where the problem of factorization breaking is absent , is @xmath5 , which was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite specifically for rhic .    linearly polarized gluons in proton - nucleus scattering have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where factorization may also work out in the dilute - dense regime as discussed in ref .",
    "these studies also suggest that at small @xmath6-fractions of the gluons inside a nucleus , the distribution of linear polarization may reach its maximally allowed size , which is bounded by the distribution of unpolarized gluons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , just like in the case of linearly polarized photons , which are perturbatively generated from electrons , linearly polarized gluons are also perturbatively generated from unpolarized quarks and gluons inside the proton @xcite .",
    "this determines the large transverse momentum tail of the distribution @xcite .",
    "it shows that the tail falls off with the same power as the unpolarized gluon distribution .",
    "therefore , the degree of polarization does not fall off with increasing transverse momentum , see figure 2 of ref .",
    "this means that although the magnitude has not yet been determined from experiment , the expectation is that it is not small at high energy .",
    "it has also recently been noted that @xmath3 affects the angular independent transverse momentum distribution of scalar or pseudoscalar particles , such as the higgs boson @xcite or charmonium and bottomonium states @xcite .",
    "these results could help pinpoint the quantum numbers of the boson recently discovered at lhc or allow a determination of @xmath3 at lhcb for example .",
    "these ideas are very similar to the suggestions to use linear polarization at photon colliders to investigate higgs production @xcite and heavy quark production @xcite , that are of interest for investigations at ilc .",
    "there are some notable differences with the proton distributions though : the transverse momentum of photons radiated off from electrons is known exactly in the photon - photon scattering case , whereas in proton - proton collisions the gluonic transverse momentum distributions enter in a convolution integral .",
    "moreover , the qed case does not have the problems with non - factorizing initial and final state interactions ( isi / fsi ) that arise in the non - abelian case for certain processes . like any other transverse momentum dependent parton distribution , the",
    "function @xmath7 will receive contributions from isi or fsi and is therefore expected to be process dependent . apart from the fact that @xmath7 can thus be nonuniversal , the isi / fsi can even lead to violations of pqcd factorization at leading twist , as already mentioned above . by considering several different extractions ,",
    "the nonuniversality and the factorization breaking can be studied and quantified . from this point of view",
    "it is also very interesting to compare to the linearly polarized photon distribution inside the proton .    in the present paper",
    "we will consider heavy quark pair production in electron - proton and proton - proton collisions .",
    "it is partly intended to provide the calculational details of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it also contains additional results , for example on process dependence . also , we include the analogues in muon pair production as a means to probe @xmath2 , which describes linearly polarized photons inside unpolarized protons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we will discuss electron - hadron scattering for three cases : heavy quark pair production , dijet production and muon pair production .",
    "after presenting the general expressions , we identify the most promising azimuthal asymmetries that will allow access to @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we present upper bounds on these asymmetries , for charm and bottom quarks and muons",
    ". this will hopefully expedite future experimental investigations of these distributions .",
    "next we turn to hadron - hadron collisions and discuss in more detail the color flow dependence and factorization breaking issues , according to the latest insights @xcite .",
    "the information on linearly polarized gluons is encoded in the transverse momentum dependent correlator , for which , in this paper , we only consider unpolarized hadrons .",
    "the parton correlators describe the hadron @xmath8 parton transitions and are defined as matrix elements on the light - front lf ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a light - like vector , @xmath11 , conjugate to @xmath12 ) .",

    "in this paper we have presented expressions for azimuthal asymmetries that arise in heavy quark and muon pair production due to the fact that gluons and also photons inside unpolarized hadrons can be linearly polarized .",
    "we studied these asymmetries for both electron - hadron and hadron - hadron scattering , not taking into account the presence of initial and final state interactions , which however modify the expressions by @xmath146-dependent pre - factors if not hampering tmd factorization altogether . for the processes considered in this paper this",

    "these turn out to be very sizable in certain transverse momentum regions .",
    "this finding , together with the relative simplicity of the measurements , are very promising concerning a future extraction of the linearly polarized gluon distribution @xmath258 at eic or lhec .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to the linearly polarized photon distribution inside unpolarized protons through muon pair production .",
    "these measurements can be made relatively free from background , where for heavy quark pair production the contributions from intrinsic charm and bottom can be suppressed by restricting to the @xmath6 region below 0.1 ( of course , the study of the polarization of intrinsic heavy quarks is of interest in itself ) and for muon pair production the drell - yan background can be cut out by kinematic constraints . for the case of dijet production",
    "the asymmetries are expected to be smaller and background subtractions may be more involved .",
    "next we considered heavy quark and muon pair production in hadron - hadron collisions . in this case",
    "the main concern is the breaking of factorization due to isi and fsi . as explained in sect .",
    "[ colorflow ] , cross sections can be expressed in terms of five universal @xmath258 tmds , in process dependent combinations , if factorization holds to begin with .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath246 process probes the same combination of two of the five universal functions as processes like @xmath5 or @xmath247 .",
    "this restricted universality can be tested experimentally , using rhic or lhc data . in the process",
    "@xmath254 factorization is expected to be broken , therefore , it is of interest to compare the extractions of @xmath258 from @xmath246 and @xmath254 , in order to learn about the size and importance of the factorization breaking effects",

    "could also be very instructive .",

    "<S> we study azimuthal asymmetries in heavy quark pair production in unpolarized electron - proton and proton - proton collisions , where the asymmetries originate from the linear polarization of gluons inside unpolarized hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> we provide cross section expressions and study the maximal asymmetries allowed by positivity , for both charm and bottom quark pair production . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bounds on the asymmetries are shown to be very large depending on the transverse momentum of the heavy quarks , which is promising especially for their measurements at a possible future electron - ion collider or a large hadron electron collider . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the analogous processes and asymmetries in muon pair production as a means to probe linearly polarized photons inside unpolarized protons . for increasing invariant mass of the muon pair </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries become very similar to the heavy quark pair ones . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the process dependence of the results that arises due to differences in color flow and address the problem with factorization in case of proton - proton collisions . </S>"
