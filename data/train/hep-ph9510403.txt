    "rare @xmath5-meson decays induced by the flavour changing neutral current @xmath6 transition represent important channels for testing the standard model ( sm ) and for searching the effects of possible new interactions @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "these processes , that in sm do not occur in the born approximation , are particularly sensitive to perturbative qcd corrections and to possible higher mass scales and interactions predicted in supersymmetric theories , two higgs doublet and topcolor models , left - right models , etc .",
    "such interactions determine the operators and their wilson coefficients appearing in the low energy @xmath7 effective hamiltonian @xmath8 that governs the @xmath2 transition .    from the experimental point of view , the radiative @xmath9 decay has been observed and measured by cleo ii collaboration both in the inclusive @xmath10 and exclusive @xmath11 modes ; the experimental results @xmath12 and @xmath13 have prompted a number of analyses aimed at restricting the parameter space of various extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "similar analyses have also been proposed for the transition @xmath14 , that has not been observed , yet @xcite ; in this case , the invariant dilepton mass distribution and the asymmetry of the dilepton angular distribution , together with the total decay rate , can be used to study the features of the interaction inducing the decay . however , for the exclusive modes such as @xmath15 and @xmath1 one has to face the problem of computing the matrix element of @xmath8 between the states @xmath5 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , a problem related to the nonperturbative sector of qcd .    for these matrix elements , either specific hadronization models @xcite or information from two point function qcd sum rules",
    "@xcite and from the heavy meson chiral theory @xcite , embedded in the vector meson dominance framework , have been used so far .",
    "the resulting theoretical predictions are characterized by a considerable model dependence ; it should be noticed that , differently from the case of @xmath18 , where the hadronic matrix element must be computed only at one kinematical point , in correspondence to the on - shell photon , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 the matrix elements must be known in a wide range of the invariant mass squared of the lepton pair : @xmath19 $ ] ; therefore , the vector meson dominance assumption has not negligible consequences on the theoretical outcome .    an approach based on general features of qcd that allows us to compute the hadronic matrix elements in a range of @xmath20",
    "is provided by three - point function qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "this method , first employed to compute the pion form factor @xcite , has been widely applied to heavy meson semileptonic decays : for example , in the case of @xmath21 semileptonic transitions , it has been used to compute the isgur - wise universal function @xmath22 and the heavy quark mass corrections @xcite .",
    "moreover , the decays @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are positive parity @xmath25 meson states , have been analyzed both for finite heavy quark masses @xcite and in the limit @xmath26 , with the calculation of the universal functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 analogous to the isgur - wise function @xcite . for the heavy - to - light meson transitions , such as @xmath29 , the various matrix elements have also been computed @xcite ; in the case of @xmath18 , this approach , employed in @xcite , has provided us with the prediction @xmath30 @xcite , that agrees with the central value obtained from the experimental data in eqs.([inclusivo])-([esclusivo ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we want to apply the three - point function qcd sum rule method to compute the hadronic quantities appearing in the calculation of @xmath31 .",
    "we shall observe that the various form factors parametrizing the relevant matrix elements have common features with other heavy - to - light meson transitions , a behaviour whose origin is worth investigating in detail @xcite .",
    "we shall also compare the computed hadronic quantities to the findings of lattice qcd , even though these last results are obtained after extrapolations in the heavy quark mass and in the momentum transfer .",
    "finally , we shall apply our results to predict the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair in the decays @xmath32 and the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath1 in the standard model .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we write down the ( sm ) effective hamiltonian for the transition @xmath14 , and resume the available information on the wilson coefficients . in sec .",
    "iii we compute by three - point function qcd sum rules the relevant hadronic quantities for @xmath0 ; the same calculation is carried out for @xmath1 in sec .",
    "iv . in sect . v we study the relations derived by isgur and wise @xcite and burdman and donoghue @xcite between rare and semileptonic form factors .",
    "such relations can be worked out in the infinite heavy quark mass limit @xmath33 , in the region of maximum momentum transfer @xmath34 ; a relevant problem is whether they are satisfied also in the low @xmath34 region , as it has been argued by several authors .",

    "the various extensions of the standard model , such as models involving supersymmetry , multihiggs and left - right models , induce two kind of changes in the low energy hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) : first , the values of the coefficients @xmath69 are modified as an effect of additional virtual particles in the loop diagrams describing the @xmath2 transition , and , second , new operators can appear in the operator basis , such as operators with different chirality of the quark current with respect to @xmath70 , e.g. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "we find a kind of common feature , i.e. all form factors deviating from the polar dependence ( excluding @xmath84 ) seem to depend linearly on the momentum transfer , with small ( positive or negative ) slopes .",

    "the form factors @xmath220 and @xmath221 have been computed by lattice qcd @xcite near the point of zero recoil and for the mass of the heavy quark smaller than @xmath198 , due to the finite size of the available lattices ; therefore , the results at @xmath228 and for a realistic value of @xmath198 are obtained after an extrapolation in the momentum transfer and in the heavy quark mass .",

    "albeit in principle correct , we feel that , from the experimental point of view , the procedure of extracting the semileptonic @xmath299 form factors near zero recoil will be rather difficult , with large uncertainties in the final result .",

    "the important point to be stressed is that , in the distribution depicted in fig.5 the theoretical uncertainty connected to the hadronic matrix element is reduced to a well defined qcd computational scheme ( qcd sum rules ) , so that in the studies of the effects of interactions beyond the standard model the hadronic uncertainty plays no more a major role .",
    "a great deal of information can be obtained from the channel @xmath341 investigating , together with the lepton invariant mass distribution , also the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry in the dilepton angular distribution ; this may reveal effects beyond the standard model that could not be observed in the analysis of the decay rate .",
    "a fb asymmetry in the dilepton angular distribution is a hint on parity violation .",

    "@xcite this pattern strongly depends on the value of the top quark mass , and the penguin diagrams with @xmath343 exchange and the @xmath344 box diagram are expected to overwhelm the photon penguin diagram in correspondence to the measured @xmath345 . moreover , since the fb asymmetry is sensitive not only to the magnitude of the wilson coefficients , but also to their sign @xcite , it can be used to probe the values predicted by the standard model .",
    "let us define @xmath346 as the angle between the @xmath347 direction and the @xmath5 direction in the rest frame of the lepton pair .",

    "the analysis of the individual shapes of the helicity amplitudes ( neglecting the long distance contribution ) shows that @xmath369 and @xmath370 have comparable size , and therefore there is a cancellation of their contribution in eq.([asim ] ) ; moreover , they are small with respect to @xmath371 . in the region of large @xmath20 , @xmath372 dominates over @xmath373 , whereas the situation is reversed for low dilepton invariant mass squared , and this is the reason of the small positive asymmetry appearing in fig.6 for @xmath374 .",
