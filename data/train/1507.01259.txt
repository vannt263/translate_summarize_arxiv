    "thus @xmath523 .",
    "in order to make @xmath490 to a valid partition of @xmath10 , we update @xmath490 by the following process .",
    "consider any @xmath524 . since @xmath525 is connected but @xmath514 is not , @xmath34 is a bridge in @xmath526 and @xmath514 can be partitioned into two connected parts @xmath527 and @xmath528 . due to the @xmath69-sparsity",
    ", we have @xmath529 implying @xmath530 . on the other hand , by the monotonicity of @xmath340 , @xmath531 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath532 , and ( [ eq : last ] ) implies that @xmath527 and @xmath528 are @xmath69-tight .",
    "hence each of @xmath527 and @xmath528 is contained in some @xmath533 .",
    "if @xmath527 and @xmath528 are both contained in the same @xmath75 , then we have @xmath534 by @xmath535",
    ". hence we update @xmath490 by replacing @xmath75 with @xmath536 , which keeps @xmath537 .",
    "if @xmath527 and @xmath528 are not contained in the same @xmath75 , then without loss of generality assume that @xmath75 contains @xmath538 for @xmath321 .",
    "we have @xmath539 by @xmath540 for each @xmath321",
    ". therefore we update @xmath490 by removing @xmath313 and @xmath314 from @xmath490 and inserting @xmath541 .",
    "this again keeps @xmath537 .",
    "we perform the above modification one by one for each @xmath524 .",
    "since each update keeps @xmath537 , we finally get a valid partition @xmath490 of @xmath10 with @xmath542 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be two integers with @xmath101 and @xmath272 , and @xmath59 be a polymatroidal function on @xmath543 . in this section",
    "we show how to check the @xmath69-sparsity of a given @xmath11-labeled graph @xmath12 in polynomial time .",
    "this also gives an algorithm for checking the independence and computing the rank of the matroid induced by @xmath69 .",
    "we assume that we are given an oracle that returns @xmath544 in polynomial time for each @xmath56 .",
    "we first give an algorithm to compute @xmath545 for a given @xmath36 .",
    "we need to show how to compute @xmath546 .",
    "to compute @xmath62 , we fist take any spanning tree @xmath218 in @xmath219 , and compute the @xmath218-respecting equivalent @xmath213 by switching",
    ". then @xmath547 generates @xmath548 for any @xmath37 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed exposition ) , and hence @xmath222 .",
    "thus @xmath62 can be computed in polynomial time .    to compute @xmath546 , it remains to check whether @xmath5 is near - balanced .",
    "for this , we test whether a vertex @xmath37 can be a base or not as follows .",
    "we take a spanning tree @xmath218 of @xmath219 by extending a spanning forest of @xmath549 , and let @xmath213 be a @xmath218-respecting equivalent gain function .",
    "proposition  [ prop:0 ] implies that @xmath39 is a base for the near - balancedness of @xmath5 if and only if @xmath5 is unbalanced and there is a non - identity element @xmath95 such that    * @xmath265 for @xmath550 , * for each fraction @xmath46 of @xmath219 at @xmath39 , either @xmath551 or @xmath552 for @xmath553 , * @xmath554 for every @xmath555 .",
    "thus one can check whether @xmath39 can be a base by computing a @xmath218-respecting equivalent gain function @xmath213 .    for checking @xmath69-sparsity ,",
    "we need the following simple lemma . recall that the @xmath1-count matroid @xmath556 of @xmath6 consists of the set of all @xmath1-sparse edge sets in @xmath6 as the independent set family .",
    "[ lem : algo1 ] @xmath12 is @xmath69-sparse if and only if @xmath6 is @xmath557-sparse and @xmath558 for every nonempty @xmath559 that is a circuit in @xmath560 for some @xmath561 .",
    "the necessity is trivial , and we prove the sufficiency .",
    "suppose to the contrary that @xmath12 is not @xmath69-sparse .",
    "take any @xmath36 such that @xmath562 . then @xmath563 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath6 is @xmath557-sparse , we have @xmath564 .",
    "therefore , there is an integer @xmath565 with @xmath561 such that @xmath566 . since @xmath5 is dependent in @xmath560",
    ", @xmath5 contains a circuit @xmath362 in @xmath560 .",
    "note that @xmath567 .",
    "hence by the monotonicity of @xmath340 , we get @xmath568 , which is a contradiction .",
    "based on lemma  [ lem : algo1 ] we have the following naive algorithm for checking @xmath69-sparsity :    1 .",
    "check whether @xmath6 is @xmath557-sparse . if @xmath6 is not @xmath557-sparse , then @xmath12 is not @xmath69-sparse .",
    "for each @xmath565 with @xmath561 , enumerate all the circuits in @xmath560 and check wether @xmath558 holds for each circuit @xmath362 in @xmath560 . if there is a circuit @xmath362 with @xmath569 ,",
    "then @xmath12 is not @xmath69-sparse ; otherwise it is @xmath69-sparse .",
    "it is well - known that checking @xmath557-sparsity can be reduced to computing a maximum matching in an auxiliary bipartite graph of size @xmath570 , which can be done in @xmath571 time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as for the second step ,",
    "observe that the number of circuits in @xmath560 is @xmath572 .",
    "this can be seen as follows . if @xmath560 is not connected ( in the matroid sense ) , then the number of circuits in each connected component @xmath362 is @xmath573 by induction and the sum over all components is @xmath572 .",
    "hence we may assume that @xmath560 is connected , and the rank of @xmath560 is @xmath574 .",
    "since the size of the ground set is at most @xmath575 ( as @xmath6 is @xmath557-sparse ) , the rank of the dual of @xmath560 is at most @xmath565 .",
    "therefore the number of the hyperplanes in the dual is @xmath572 , which in turn implies the claimed bound for the number of circuits .",
    "it is known that all the circuits in a matroid can be enumerated in time polynomial in the size of the ground set and the number of the circuits  @xcite , if a polynomial - time oracle for the rank function is available . in our case ,",
    "the number of circuits is polynomial in @xmath570 ( assuming that @xmath21 is constant ) and the rank of @xmath560 can be computed in @xmath576 time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the second step can also be done in polynomial time .",
    "developing a practical polynomial time algorithm whose time complexity is @xmath577 for some constant @xmath578 irrelevant to @xmath21 is left as an open problem .",
