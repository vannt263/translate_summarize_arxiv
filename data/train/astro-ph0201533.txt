    "other active stars also show such an ifip effect ( @xcite ) , while it is not present in the intermediately active capella ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear whether there is an enrichment or a depletion of the coronal material compared to the photospheric material in rs cvn systems , because of the high levels of activity and the short rotation periods .",
    "estimates for hr  1099 range from [ fe / h]@xmath0 to 0 .",
    "hence the ifip effect may only reflect the photospheric composition .",
    "however , in an analysis of solar analogs with known photospheric abundances ( close to solar ) , @xcite ( see also @xcite in these proceedings ) find an evolution from an ifip to a normal fip effect with decreasing activity , suggesting that the transition is real .",

    "its letgs spectrum displays bright emission lines from h - like and he - like transitions of various elements ( c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca ) , and a rich forest of lines from fe l - shell and 2s-2p lines . a few bright l - shell lines from si and ne can be identified as well .",

    "we have used the updated mekal code available in the spex fitting program ( @xcite ) to fit the average letgs spectrum ( after co - adding the positive and negative orders ) .",
    "we have performed a multi - temperature fit to obtain coronal abundances and then used a chebychev polynomial approach to derive the emission measure ( em ) distribution .",

    "an enhanced ne abundance is found , similarly to results shown by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "note that the abundances differ from those obtained from the _ xmm - newton _ rgs data ( see @xcite in these proceedings ) , although the same systematic trend can be found .",
