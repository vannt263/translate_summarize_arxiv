    "we consider the problem of finding the best approximation @xmath489 of the function @xmath490 by the functions @xmath381 .",
    "the function @xmath491 is not identically zero and possesses exactly @xmath444 extremal points .",
    "these extremal points form a good initial set for the remez algorithm . in the case when the functions @xmath20 coincide with the powers @xmath201 , the function @xmath492 coincides ( up to a constant factor ) with the tchebyshev polynomial @xmath493 and the extremal points are given by @xmath494 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the approximation problem may be discretized and interpreted as a linear programming problem and solved by available software .",
    "we take a finite subset @xmath495 $ ] consisting of points @xmath496 , where @xmath497 .",
    "the condition @xmath498 can be written as @xmath499 our problem is to _ minimize _ the linear function @xmath500 subject to @xmath501 linear constraints @xmath502 the obtained problem can be solved by a variety of methods available for solving linear programming problems , see @xcite , @xcite for details .    at the end of this section we return to the case of the complex - valued function @xmath97 . as was mentioned in remark [ haarfails ]",
    "the haar condition may fail for the subspace @xmath382 .",
    "even if the haar condition holds , there is no immediate generalization of the remez algorithm for the complex - valued case .",
    "the reason is that the remez algorithm is based on the existence of a characteristic set of a function consisting of exactly @xmath444 points .",
    "we remind that a subset @xmath495 $ ] is called characteristic for the function @xmath113 if the best approximation of @xmath113 on the whole segment @xmath37 $ ] coincides with the best approximation on the subset @xmath503 , but does not coincide on any proper subset of @xmath503 .",
    "contrary to the real - valued case in the complex - valued case a characteristic set may contain any number of points between @xmath444 and @xmath504 , see @xcite . there is no simple way to determine the number of characteristic points for a given function .",
    "what is more , the given function may have several characteristic sets containing different numbers of points .",
    "in the existing algorithms the discretized problem is considered and solved directly as a nonlinear optimization problem , e.g. , a convex programming problem @xcite , @xcite , or the problem is transformed into a semi - infinite programming problem with the use of the fact that @xmath505 .",
    "the dual problem is considered and discretized for the second time with respect to the angle @xmath506 and solved by the simplex method @xcite , @xcite or by a remez - like algorithm @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if the obtained approximation is not sufficiently close to the best one , the optimality criterium of the best approximation @xcite , @xcite is reformulated as a system of nonlinear equations and the newton iterations are used to improve the accuracy , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for details .",
    "in this section we present several numerical examples illustrating the application of the described results on generalized wave polynomials and approximation by functions @xmath352 to numerical solution of the cauchy problem ( [ cauchy1 ] ) , ( [ cauchy2 ] ) . on the first step",
    "the initial data @xmath113 and @xmath314 are approximated by @xmath97-polynomials and then the approximate solution of the problem ( [ cauchy1 ] ) , ( [ cauchy2 ] ) , the function @xmath353 from proposition [ prop approx sol estimate ] , is calculated on a mesh of points in the triangle from the figure in section [ sectcauchyproblem ] and compared to a corresponding exact solution .",
    "all calculations were performed using matlab in the machine precision . for the construction of the system of the functions",
    "@xmath20 the following strategy was implemented using two matlab routines from the spline toolbox : on each step the integrand is approximated by a spline using the command ` spapi ` and then it is integrated using ` fnint ` .",
    "this leads to a good accuracy , and the computation of the first 180200 or even more functions @xmath20 proved to be a completely feasible task .",
    "in all the reported examples the number of subintervals in which the considered segment is divided when the integrand is approximated by a spline was 3000 and the splines were of the forth order . in the presented numerical results we specify the parameter @xmath134 which is the number of the calculated functions",
    "@xmath20 .    [ ex1]consider the cauchy problem @xmath507@xmath508 the exact solution of this problem has the form @xmath509 the corresponding second - order ordinary differential equation ( [ slhom ] ) , @xmath510 admits a nonvanishing solution @xmath511 , @xmath192 .",
    "based on this solution we construct @xmath134 functions @xmath20 defined by ( [ phik ] ) and ( [ x1])([x3 ] ) with @xmath87 .",
    "the initial data for this example were chosen such that both @xmath113 and @xmath314 admit uniformly convergent on @xmath37 $ ] generalized taylor series ( see subsection [ subsect gen der and gen taylor ] ) whose expansion coefficients are known explicitly .",
    "indeed , observe that @xmath113 and @xmath314 are solutions of the equation @xmath512 with different values of the parameter @xmath96 . in the case of @xmath113 : @xmath513 and in the case of @xmath314 : @xmath514 .",
    "since @xmath515 and @xmath516 due to theorem [ thgensolsturmliouville copy(1 ) ] the function @xmath113 can be represented as follows @xmath517 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined by ( [ u1u2 ] ) and the series are uniformly convergent on @xmath37 $ ]  for any finite @xmath309 .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath132 from ( [ g and h as series ] ) have the form@xmath518 analogously we obtain @xmath519 and the coefficients @xmath520 from ( [ g and h as series ] ) have the form @xmath521    as an example let us take @xmath522 , @xmath523 and @xmath524 . consider the @xmath97-polynomials @xmath136 and @xmath525 from proposition [ prop approx sol estimate ] with @xmath526 obtained by truncating the generalized taylor series ( [ g and h as series ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] depicts the distribution of the absolute error of such approximation of the functions @xmath113 and @xmath314 .",
    "one can observe that the apparently simplier function @xmath527 is approximated much worse ( @xmath528 against @xmath529 ) by the truncated generalized taylor polynomial .",
    "the distribution of the absolute error of approximation of the solution of the cauchy problem ( [ cauchy1ex1 ] ) , ( [ cauchy2ex1 ] ) is presented on figure [ fig3 ] . typically for an approximation based on a taylor expansion ( generalized or not ) the absolute error increases with the distance from the center . obviously , neither always the expansion coefficients of the generalized taylor series of the initial data are available in a closed form nor always a continuous function is representable in the form of such a series . in section [ sectapprox ] several other possibilities for approximating functions by @xmath97-polynomials were discussed . in the present example alternatively to the generalized taylor expansion we also apply the remez algorithm ( with the single exchange method ) .",
    "the developed computer program in matlab establishes the corresponding value of @xmath134 for approximating a function by an @xmath97-polynomial after which ( for @xmath158 , @xmath444 , etc . ) the approximation can not be significantly improved limited by the machine precision .",
    "thus , for the considered example the function @xmath113 was approximated by @xmath530 meanwhile @xmath314 was approximated by @xmath531 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] depicts the distribution of the corresponding absolute error of approximation .",
    "the maximum value of the absolute error for @xmath113 was of order @xmath532 and for @xmath314  @xmath529 .",
    "the distribution of the absolute error of approximation of the solution of the cauchy problem ( [ cauchy1ex1 ] ) , ( [ cauchy2ex1 ] ) is presented on figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the maximum absolute error of the approximate solution is of the order @xmath529 and to the difference from the solution computed previously with the use of the generalized taylor coefficients here the distribution of the error over the domain is more uniform .",
    "[ ex2 ] in this example we consider the same problem ( [ cauchy1ex1 ] ) , ( [ cauchy2ex1 ] ) , again with @xmath522 and @xmath524 but now with another value of @xmath170 , @xmath533 .",
    "again we have the generalized taylor coefficients in a closed form ( [ alphakex1 ] ) and ( [ betakex1 ] ) but application of the remez algorithm encounters an obstacle . as the function @xmath511 is complex valued ( see remark [ haarfails ] ) the same is true for the functions @xmath20 meanwhile as was explained in section [ sectapprox ] the remez algorithm is directly applicable only to real valued functions .    here in order to find the coefficients of the @xmath97-polynomials from proposition [ prop approx sol estimate ] by a distinct from the generalized taylor formula method we solve the corresponding linear programming problem as explained at the end of section [ sectapprox ] .",
    "how well the approximation based on the generalized taylor formula works is shown in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] where the distribution of the absolute error of approximation is depicted for @xmath113 , @xmath314 and the solution @xmath288 respectively in the case @xmath534 .",
    "the corresponding results obtained by solving the linear programming problem ( again , due to the limitation of the machine precision we used @xmath535 for the approximation of @xmath113 and @xmath536 for the approximation of @xmath314 ) are presented in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "[ ex3 ] in our final example a variable coefficient equation is considered .",
    "namely , we solve the following cauchy problem @xmath537 its exact solution is given by the expression@xmath538 the corresponding ordinary second - order equation has the form @xmath539 the functions @xmath113 and @xmath314 are solutions of the equation @xmath540 with @xmath541 and @xmath542 , respectively and hence again we have in our disposal the possibility to write down the coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath520 from ( [ g and h as series ] ) explicitly .",
    "we compute a particular solution @xmath97 of ( [ ex3eqf ] ) numerically using the spps method as described in @xcite , then compute the functions @xmath20 and the corresponding coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath520 analogously to example [ ex1 ] . the result for @xmath526",
    "is presented by figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] where the error of approximation of @xmath113 , @xmath314 and @xmath288 is depicted .",
    "application of the remez algorithm delivers the following results .",
    "the functions @xmath113 and @xmath314 were approximated by @xmath97-polynomials of order @xmath543 and @xmath544 respectively and the distribution of the absolute error of the approximate solution of ( [ cauchy1ex3])([cauchy3ex3 ] ) is depicted on figure [ fig8 ] . as can be observed with this relatively small number of functions",
