    "cobalt ferrite is under examination since more than sixty years , but still there is quite a lot of open problems . in 1988",
    "guillot observed a jump in the field dependence of the magnetization in pure cobalt ferrite with the composition co@xmath4fe@xmath5o@xmath2 and also in cd substituted cobalt ferrite @xcite .",
    "this jump was explained as a spin - flip .",
    "because of the rather low critical field this explanation was not conclusive .",
    "therefore within the present work this transition was studied in more detail .",
    "the single crystal with the composition co@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 was grown by flux method .",
    "the starting materials are 18  g na@xmath6b@xmath2o@xmath7  @xmath8  10h@xmath6o ( borax ) , 2.3  g coo ( 99.99% ) , and 6.7  g fe@xmath6o@xmath9 ( 99.99% ) .",
    "after sufficiently mixing , the materials were put in a tightly closed pt crucible and heated from room temperature to 1370  @xmath10c at a rate of 100  @xmath10c / h , and then held for a period of 6  h ; slowly cooled from 1370 to 990  @xmath10c at 2  @xmath10c / h , followed by a furnace cooling by switching off the power supply @xcite . the composition of the single crystal was checked by xrd and sem investigation .",
    "magnetization was measured from 5 to 400  k in a vibrating sample magnetometer with a superconducting 9  t coil .",
    "the single crystal was oriented by xrd in a laue setup and then transfered to the vsm sample holder .",
    "the error from transferring the single crystal from one sample holder to the other was usually smaller than 1.5@xmath10 .",
    "+ the magnetostriction was measured with a miniature capacitive dilatometer described in @xcite using a cryostat with a variable temperature insert ( vti ) and a superconducting 9  t coil .",
    "the degree of inversion of the cation distribution of the inverse spinel ( a@xmath11)[b@xmath12o@xmath2 was calculated to @xmath13 with ( co@xmath14 fe@xmath15)[co@xmath16fe@xmath17o@xmath2 and the magnetic moment of @xmath18 at @xmath19  k. the value of saturation magnetization at 5 and 10  k is practically the same due to the the very high ordering temperature .",
    "+    normalised magnetization of co@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal at @xmath20  k ]    the magnetization measurements revealed that the [ 100 ] axis is the easy axis of magnetization of co - ferrite over the whole temperature range .",
    "below 150  k a jump in the magnetization at fields occurs as it was also found in a similar material ( co@xmath4fe@xmath5o@xmath2 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : mh10k ] the normalized magnetization at @xmath20  k is plotted versus the external magnetic field .",
    "the jump is clearly visible at roughly 7  t in the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "the critical field differs from that published by guillot which can be understood regarding the different sample composition .",
    "a linear fit between 1 and 6  t was performed showing that the extrapolation to 0  t leads to a value of @xmath21{3}}$ ] , which indicates that the magnetization vector lies in the [ 100 ] axis and only the projection ( @xmath22 ) of the [ 100 ] magnetization vector into the [ 111 ] axis is measured . by increasing the magnetic field the vector starts to rotate towards the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "however as soon as the measured moment in the [ 111 ] axis achieves the value of @xmath21{2}}$ ] , the measured moment becomes equal to the [ 110 ] value measured at 0  t. at this point the system needs more energy ( field ) to overcome the magnetic anisotropy energy corresponding to the [ 110 ] axis . as a consequence the magnetization vector rotates in the [ 110 ] axis to a local energy minimum in order to reduce energy . in figure",
    "[ fig : geo ] the offset of the linear fits assuming such a geometrical model below the transition are shown .",
    "the error due to misalignment is found to be 1.5@xmath10 for the [ 111 ] axis and 0.3@xmath10 for the [ 110 ] axis .",
    "obviously our geometric model works well from 5  k up to 250  k. above 250  k the anisotropy along the [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] axis decreases and the magnetization vector can rotate smoothly ( without a discontinuity ) out of the easy axis .",
    "+    offset of the linear fits of normalized magnetization of co@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 as a function of temperature .",
    "the straight lines indicate the geometrical fit ]    by this geometrical considerations one can see that the origin of the magnetization jump is not a spin - flip , but a rotation in the magnetization due to the higher order anisotropy constants which cause a more complicated shape of the anisotropy energy @xmath23 .",
    "+ such anisotropy driven magnetization jumps are generally called fomp ( first order magnetization process ) and were also found in other complex systems and alloys ( as e.g. prco5 - see @xcite , re@xmath6fe@xmath24c @xcite , refe@xmath25ti @xcite or nd@xmath6fe@xmath26b @xcite ) .      the magnetic anisotropy was determined with the integral method @xmath27 along the measured crystallographic axis of the single crystal . applying the formula @xmath28 , where the @xmath29 are the direction cosines in polar coordinates , the anisotropy constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath3 were determined . for using the integral method",
    "it is pre - requisite to saturate the sample fully .",
    "it is reported that the saturation along the intermediate and hard axis is reached at around 18  t at @xmath32  k @xcite .",
    "our measurements were only performed up to 9  t , therefore extrapolating the m(h ) curves to saturation causes a rather large error ( @xmath33 20% for @xmath31 and @xmath33 30% @xmath3 ) , but they are still in the range of reported values of @xmath31 in literature . + in figure  [ fig : eaconst ] the anisotropy constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath3 of the single crystal and @xmath31 of a polycrystalline sample are plotted against the temperature . for obtaining @xmath31 for the polycrystalline sample we used the law of approach to saturation . measuring the polycrystalline sample",
    "the maximum magnetic field was only 9  t and the sample not fully saturated .",
    "accordingly all reported values in literature using the law of approach to saturation are not giving the correct value of @xmath31 , because they estimate only @xmath31 and not higher order anisotropy constants . + it is interesting to note that no values for @xmath3 are reported in literature .",
    "above @xmath34  k the value of @xmath3 is @xmath35  6 times higher than @xmath31 and below the fomp the factor is even much higher , yielding in an increased anisotropy along the [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] axes .",
    "+    anisotropy constants of co@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal and one polycrystalline specimen as a function of temperature , scaledwidth=47.0% ]      we are presenting the first magnetostriction measurement at @xmath36  k demonstrating also the effect of such a field induced transition in the magnetoelastic behaviour as shown in figure  [ fig : ms4k ] .",
    "magnetostriction measurements of co@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal at @xmath36k ]    due to hysteresis effects ( remanence ) the magnetostriction measurements at low temperatures are very difficult and need a special measuring procedure as will be published elsewhere .",
    "but when increasing the magnetic field above the critical field , a huge jump in the magnetostriction occurs . at higher fields due to rotational magnetization process",
    "no hysteresis effects are observed .",
    "we have proved that the jump in the magnetization can be explained as an anisotropy driven transition which is called `` fomp '' .",
    "the transition is caused by a rotation of the magnetization vector jumping over an energy barrier . at low temperatures the second anisotropy constant @xmath3 is increasing which strengthens the [ 100 ] axis as easy axis and underlines the [ 110 ] as intermediate and the [ 111 ] as hard axis .",
    "these assumptions are also supported by geometric considerations explaining the values of the @xmath37 curves as measured in the different crystallographic directions .",
    "additionally we present an accurate measurement of @xmath38 at a temperature of 4.2  k showing also this critical transition in the magnetoelastic behaviour .",
