    "the spin system of chiral magnets is described by a classical heisenberg model on the 2d square lattice , where the dimensionless local magnetic moments @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the local spin at @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a plank constant divided by @xmath31 ) are treated as classical vectors whose length is fixed to be @xmath32 .",

    "the typical dm interaction @xmath41 , which is used in most of this paper , gives the transition between the helical and skyrmion - crystal phases at @xmath42 , while that between the skyrmion - crystal and ferromagnetic phases at @xmath43 .",

    "the coefficient of the fourth term @xmath57 determines the strength of the nonadiabatic torque .",
    "the electric current density @xmath58 is assumed to be proportional to the electric field @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the scalar potential , that is , @xmath61 . here",
    "the coefficient is absorbed into the definition of @xmath62 . for a steady current distribution",
    ", the conservation of current , @xmath63 , leads to the poisson equation for @xmath62 , @xmath64 , which should reflect the system shape with boundary conditions that the current density @xmath65 is flowing in from right and flowing out to left as @xmath66 ( see methods for numerical method to calculate @xmath56 ) .",
    "the motion of a skyrmion confined in a narrow region is completely different from that in the non - confined plane because of confining forces from boundaries .",
    "the sample shape considered here is a long stripline - shaped system along @xmath36-direction with nanometric width @xmath67 along @xmath37-direction as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "[ fig : jv ] depends strongly on @xmath54 , @xmath57 and the impurity effect , which is very similar to that of the helical phase or ferromagnetic domain walls . especially when @xmath74 , the skyrmion stops even without impurity , which is regarded as the intrinsic pinning ( see supplementary movie 1 ) .",
    "this characteristic can be explained by the thiele equation for the centre of mass @xmath75  @xcite of a spin texture ( see supplementary information i for details ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the drift velocity of the spin texture and @xmath78 is the velocity of the conduction electrons , which can be identified as the current density @xmath79 except a factor . the first term in the left hand side of eq .",
    "describes the magnus force with @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the unit vector along @xmath82-direction and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 : skyrmion number ) for the skyrmion , while @xmath85 for the domain wall or helix .",
    "the second term represents the dissipative force where the components @xmath86 of the tensor @xmath87 are @xmath88 and @xmath89 for otherwise .",
    "the third term @xmath90 stands for the force due to the potential @xmath91 from surrounding environment such as boundaries as well as that from the impurities .",
    "the mechanism for the repulsive potential due to the boundary is that the in - plane tilt at the edge has the opposite direction to that at the perimeter of the skyrmion .",
    "we have demonstrated that this mechanism produces the potential barrier in the presence of the dm interaction using a one - dimensional model in supplementary information ii .",
    "let us start with the case of skyrmion motion without the boundary or impurities , i.e. , @xmath92 . in this case , considering the fact that @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the dominant term in eq .",
    "is @xmath95 and hence we obtain @xmath96 , i.e. , universal current - velocity relation .",
    "the small correction due to @xmath97 gives the skyrmion hall effect transverse to the current given by the additional velocity @xmath98 .",
    "when the pinning force @xmath99 is there , the threshold current density @xmath100 is determined as @xmath101 , which is much smaller than the case of domain wall motion where @xmath85 and hence @xmath102 .",
    "now we turn to the confined case . in the steady state",
    ", the drift velocity @xmath103 is along the @xmath36-direction while its @xmath37-coordinate is nonzero due to the presence of the boundary . in the absence of impurities",
    ", @xmath104 comes from the confining potential and hence @xmath105 is finite near the boundary while @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath36-component of eq .   reads @xmath107 while that of @xmath37-component @xmath108 gives the equilibrium condition and determines @xmath109 .",
    "namely , the magnus force is balanced with the confining force , while the dissipative terms determine the velocity .",
    "equation is exactly the same as that of the domain wall motion . in the presence of impurities ,",
    "the threshold current density @xmath110 is determined by as @xmath111 , which is again very similar to the case of domain wall  @xcite . assuming the confining potential as @xmath112 , eq .",
    "means that @xmath109 is the  momentum \" conjugate to @xmath113 with @xmath114 playing the role of mass .",
    "this might appear to be a serious obstacle for applications .",
    "however , the distance @xmath115 a skyrmion travels before it stops can be long .",
    "[ fig : transient ] and also see supplementary movies 2 and 3 ) .",
    "if the skyrmion starts from the middle of the channel , @xmath115 reaches more than @xmath116 @xmath117 m for @xmath118 , @xmath119 a / m@xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 nm ( this value of @xmath67 is approximately four times larger than the diameter of skyrmion @xmath123 nm , where the radius is defines as twice the distance from the core @xmath124 to the perimeter @xmath125 ) .",
    "the distance @xmath115 could depend on various factor , for example , type or strength of disorder , size of skyrmion , @xmath97 , and initial position of the skyrmion .",
    "we have investigated other parameter sets and we can conclude that only its initial @xmath37-coordinate and @xmath126 affect the traveling distance @xmath115 ( see supplementary information iii ) .",
    "next we demonstrate the creation of skyrmion in a stripline - shaped system with a square notch structure ( the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : creation ] ) .",
    "( the notch is often discussed for the domain wall pinning  @xcite , and the motion of a skyrmion through a triangular notch has been simulated in  @xcite ) figure  [ fig : creation ] exhibits snapshots of the spin configuration around the notch at selected times , where the creation of skyrmion is observed ( see also supplementary movie 4 ) . here",
    "we fix the magnetic field at @xmath68 , which is slightly above @xmath18 .",
    "namely , the ferromagnetic state is the ground state .",
    "spins without electric current have large in - plane components near the boundary owing to the dm interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : creation]a and supplementary information iv ) . as the electric current flows",
    ", the spin texture at the notch swells out due to the spin transfer torque , and one can regard this portion as the seed of a skyrmion ( fig .  [",
    "fig : creation]b ) . subsequently spins behind the seed become automatically twisted and pointing down due to the dm interaction , and eventually the skyrmion core is created ( fig .",
    "[ fig : creation]c ) .",
    "this spin twist toward generating the skyrmion core is due to the spin precession .",
    "the unique direction of the precession breaks the reflection symmetry , and , thereby , an asymmetry with respect to the sign of @xmath65 arises as shown below . at the early stage after its creation",
    ", the radius of the created skyrmion slightly oscillates , and eventually the radius converges to arrive at a metastable energy minimum via the gilbert - damping process .",
    "the magnetic structure at the notch , not the winding current pattern , is essential in creation process . to confirm this",
    ", we simulated the dynamics in the following two fictitious conditions .",
    "the first condition is the uniform current distribution without modifying the magnetic structure at the notch . in this case",
    ", skyrmions are created as in the case of realistic current distribution .",
    "the next condition is the modified magnetic structure such that spins next to the edge point in @xmath82-direction by a huge magnetic field . in this case ,",
    "skyrmion was never created .",
    "the creation rate of skyrmions @xmath127 ( the number of skyrmions created per time ) as a function of the current density @xmath65 for several values of magnetic field @xmath8 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cre_rate]a . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cre_rate]b , a colour plot of the rate @xmath127 is presented in the plane of @xmath65 and @xmath8 .",
    "we find that a larger current density is necessary to create skyrmions under a stronger magnetic field .",
    "surprisingly , skyrmions are created even under a magnetic field which largely exceeds @xmath18 up to @xmath128 , where the skyrmion ceases to be metastable .",
    "in addition , the @xmath65-@xmath127 plot is asymmetric between @xmath65 and @xmath129 , i.e. , the current flowing in the opposite direction can not generate skyrmions .",
    "the threshold current density @xmath130 is of the order of @xmath131@xmath132 a / m@xmath120 .",
    "the energy cost to generate a skyrmion is @xmath133 , and this energy must be supplied by the electric current .",
    "therefore , the spin transfer torque in the llg equation should be of the same order as the precession term , namely , @xmath134 , which leads to @xmath135 which is consistent with the obtained @xmath130 .",
    "the creation rate @xmath127 depends on various conditions .",
    "if the depth of the notch @xmath136 is too small ( relative to the skyrmion radius ) , only a portion of a skyrmion can appear inside the sample , so that the swirling of spins to constitute a skyrmion structure can not be completed , and eventually it disappears as time goes by .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath136 is so large that @xmath137 is small ( @xmath67 : the sample width ) , the creation never occurs .",
    "the angle of the notch corner @xmath138 is another issue .",
    "we examined five angles , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , and found that @xmath141 is the most suitable for the creation .",
    "we have also studied the case of rounded notch , and find that the skyrmion creation occurs when the curvature radius is comparable to the size of the skyrmion .",
    "this means that the sharp edge at the corner of the notch is not essential , while the in - plane components of the spins along the notch and their shift due to the spin transfer torque are the essential mechanism .",
    "it is noted that a sign change of the dm interaction does not alter the @xmath127-@xmath65 plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cre_rate]a ) , while that of @xmath8 exchanges @xmath65 and @xmath129 in figs .",
    "[ fig : cre_rate]a and b.",
    "finally we study the motion at a junction of magnetic region and nonmagnetic leads . the sample considered here",
    "is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation ] .",
    "we set @xmath68 and study only the clean case ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "two types of skyrmion dynamics near the boundary are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation ] .",
    "the case with a small current density is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : annihilation]a  d ( see also supplementary movie 5 ) .",
    "the skyrmion bounces and can not reach the boundary since it can not overcome a repulsive potential from the boundary . in this bouncing process , the repulsive potential induces a motion transverse to the boundary because of the magnus force .",
    "eventually the skyrmion stops at a position slightly below the central line of the system .",
    "the larger current density enables a skyrmion to overcome the potential barrier , and pushes the skyrmion to the sample edge , resulting in annihilation of the skyrmion ( figs .",
    "[ fig : annihilation]e  h , and also supplementary movie 6 ) . since the skyrmion is subject to repulsive and attractive potentials before and after it overcomes the potential barrier , respectively",
    ", its trajectory is curved first downward and then upward .",
    "the threshold current density @xmath142 between the above two motions is @xmath143 a / m@xmath120 for @xmath144 .",
    "however , the strength of boundary barrier can depend on the system parameters .",
    "the additional calculations revealed that the size of the skyrmion , which is controlled by the ratio @xmath145 , is the key factor to determine the threshold current density , and smaller skyrmion can overcome the barrier more easily ( see supplementary information iii ) . the detailed analysis based on eq .",
    "is given in supplementary information i.",
    "some remarks are in order on the magnetic vortex , which has the similar dynamics to skyrmion and intensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath146 in eq.([eqn : thiele ] ) for a magnetic vortex is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 specifies the direction of the spin at centre , while @xmath149 is the vorticity .",
    "although the equation of motion looks similar to skyrmion case , there are several essential differences .",
    "( i ) the vortex is a non - local object since the spins far away from the centre are winding within the @xmath150-plane , which causes the logarithmic divergence of the energy with respect to the size of the sample  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the current - driven motion of a vortex is often studied in a finite size sample of e.g. disk shape .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to skyrmion , which has the finite size and regarded as an independent  particle \" .",
    "( ii ) for the magnetic vortex realised in a disk - shaped sample due to the dipolar interaction , there are four degenerate states corresponding to @xmath151 .",
    "it has been demonstrated that @xmath52 can change during the current - driven motion , which results in the reversal of the direction of rotational motion  @xcite . in the case of skyrmion studied in this paper ,",
    "the stable skyrmion state is unique with the skyrmion number @xmath152 being determined by the direction of the external magnetic field , and hence its dynamics is stable .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found that the @xmath65-@xmath69 relation of a confined skyrmion is similar to that of ferromagnetic domain walls , and have demonstrated a new way to create and annihilate skyrmions in constricted geometries .",
    "the creation and annihilation can be controlled easily by an electric current and a magnetic field .",
    "* numerical simulation of the llg equation .",
    "* we use the fourth - order runge - kutta method to solve the llg equation . to study the @xmath65-@xmath69 relation and the skyrmion creation ,",
    "the periodic boundary condition is imposed at the left and right sides of the sample , while the open boundary condition at other boundaries . to study the skyrmion annihilation ,",
    "the open boundary condition is imposed at all boundaries .",
    "the natural units of time @xmath153 and current density @xmath65 are @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively . with a typical lattice constant @xmath156  , spin - polarization @xmath157 and the magnitude of local magnetic moment @xmath158 ,",

    "<S> magnetic skyrmions , vortex - like swirling spin structures with quantized topological number , observed in chiral magnets , are appealing for potential applications in spintronics because it is possible to control their motion with ultralow current density . in order to realise skyrmion - based spintronic devices , it is essential to understand the skyrmion motions in confined geometries . </S>",
    "<S> here we show by micromagnetic simulations that the current - induced motion of skyrmions in the presence of geometrical boundaries is very different from that in an infinite plane . in a channel with finite width , the transverse confinement results in steady state characteristics of the skyrmion velocity as a function of current similar to those of domain walls in ferromagnets , whereas the transient behaviour depends on the initial distance of the skyrmion from the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that single skyrmions can be created by electric current in a simple constricted geometry of a plate - shaped specimen of suitable size and geometry . </S>",
    "<S> these findings could guide the design of skyrmion - based devices , in which skyrmions are used as information carriers .    </S>",
    "<S> skyrmions  @xcite and their crystallization into a triangular lattice have been recently discovered in some ferromagnets without inversion symmetry such as mnsi , fe@xmath0co@xmath1si , cu@xmath2oseo@xmath3  @xcite as a consequence of the competition between ferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath4 and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xmath5 under an external magnetic field @xmath6 . in chiral magnets , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state for @xmath7 is the helical state , which is a successive alignment of bloch domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of @xmath8 changes the helical phase to the skyrmion - crystal phase at @xmath9 , and eventually to the ferromagnetic phase at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion has magnetization antiparallel ( parallel ) to @xmath6 at their centre ( periphery ) . </S>",
    "<S> skyrmion - crystals are experimentally observed both in bulk samples  @xcite and thin - plate specimens  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy for each interaction per spin is given by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath8 for the ferromagnetic exchange interaction , dm interaction , and the zeeman energy , respectively , where @xmath13 is the length scale of the spatial variation of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the competition among these three interactions determines the phase diagram and size @xmath13 of the spin texture . </S>",
    "<S> the balance between the former two gives the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 : the lattice constant set to be 1 in the followings ) and the energy scale @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are of the order of @xmath19 , and the helix period for @xmath20 and the size of the skyrmion for @xmath21 are both of the order of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath8 is much larger than @xmath19 , on the other hand , the balance between the second and third terms determines the length scale as @xmath23 . the length scales @xmath22 and @xmath24 are of the order of 3 - 100 nm , and are much smaller than the size of magnetic bubbles with a micrometer scale in thin films of ferromagnets induced by the dipolar interaction . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the dynamics of magnetic bubbles under current should be identical to that of skyrmions , although the main means to manipulate the magnetic bubbles was the magnetic field  @xcite . moreover , the skyrmion is stable even near the room temperature in certain dm magnets  @xcite , and can be manipulated by much lower electric current than ferromagnetic domain walls  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these properties , that is , nanometric size , high operational temperature , and low threshold current , are advantageous for technical application to high - density storage devices .    in order to use skyrmions as information carriers , we must be able to drive their motion along nanostructures , as well as to nucleate them and annihilate them at will </S>",
    "<S> . however , the knowledge about motions in constricted geometries is lacking , and the generation of skyrmions is recognized to be very difficult because of the topological stability , that is , it can never be created or annihilated by continuous variation of spin configuration from uniform ferromagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> this means that discontinuous flip of local magnetization is necessary for its creation , which inevitably results in an energy cost of the order of @xmath4 although a typical energy scale of skyrmion per spin is @xmath25 defined above . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the method to create skyrmion using a circulating current was proposed  @xcite . in addition , it was reported that creation of skyrmion can be achieved by ultrashort single optical laser pulse  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nucleation of skyrmions from stripe has been also observed in hexaferrite by lorentz microscope  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the current - induced dynamics of skyrmion in several kinds of constricted geometries by the micromagnetic simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the confinement and boundary effect drastically changes the current - induced skyrmion dynamics including the steady - state current - velocity relation , transient phenomena , and also the creation and annihilation of skyrmions . </S>"
