    "one of the basic assumptions in modern cosmology , the _ cosmological principle _",
    ", is that on large - scale average our universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the apparent isotropy on large scales is normally explained as a consequence of spatial homogeneity , in turn understood as a natural result of an  inflationary \" period of the early universe ( see e.g. kolb and turner , 1990 ) .",
    "an alternative approach to explaining the apparent homogeneity is to assume an expanding universe with small and finite space sections with a non - trivial topology ( ellis and schreiber , 1986 ) , the  small universe \" model .",
    "the  small universe \" , as its name suggests , should be small enough that we have had time to see the universe around us many times since the decoupling time",
    ". the topology of the spatial sections can be quite complicated ( ellis , 1971 ) ; however , it is possible to obtain small universe models that reproduce a friedmann - lematre model by choosing certain simple geometries .",
    "for example , choosing a rectangular basic cell with sides @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and with opposite faces topologically connected , we obtain a toroidal topology for the small universe known as @xmath8 .",
    "the never - ending repetition of this @xmath8 basic cell should reproduce , at least locally , the friedmann - lematre universe model with zero curvature .",
    "the small universe model has received considerable attention in the past few years , since the topology of the universe is becoming an important problem for cosmologists . from the theoretical point of view , it is possible to have quantum creation of the universe with a nontrivial topology , i.e. , a multiply - connected topology ( zeldovich and starobinsky , 1984 ) . from the observational side , this model has been used to explain  observed \" periodicity in the distributions of quasars ( fang and sato , 1985 ) and galaxies ( broadhurst et al . , 1990 ) .    there are four known approaches for placing lower limits on the cell size of the @xmath8 model .",
    "the first two methods constrain the parameter @xmath9 , an average length scale of the small universe , defined as @xmath10 .",
    "the third and fourth methods constrain the parameter @xmath11 , the ratio between the cell size @xmath12 , here defined as @xmath13 , and radius of the decoupling sphere @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the first method constrains @xmath9 assuming that it is larger than any distinguishable structure . using this method , fairall ( 1985 )",
    "suggests that @xmath16mpc .",
    "the second method constrains @xmath9 based on  observed \" periodicity in quasar redshifts . attempting to identify opposite pairs of quasars ,",
    "fang and liu ( 1988 ) suggested that @xmath17mpc and using quasar redshift periodicity , fang and sato ( 1985 ) suggested @xmath18mpc .",
    "the third and fourth methods constrain @xmath11 using the cmb . with the third method , stevens et al .",
    "( 1993 ) obtain the constraint @xmath19 using the slope information from the 1st year of cobe / dmr data ( smoot et al . , 1992 ) while , with the fourth method , jing and fang ( 1994 ) obtain a best fit @xmath20 using the correlation function from the 2-year cobe / dmr data .    as pointed out by zeldovich ( 1973 ) , the power spectrum of density perturbations is continuous ( i.e. , all wave numbers are possible ) if the universe has a euclidean topology , and discrete ( i.e. , only some wave numbers are possible ) if the topology has finite space sections .",
    "many years later these ideas were related with the expected cmb power spectrum ( fang and mo , 1987 ; sokolov , 1993 ; starobinsky , 1993 ) , mainly after the quadrupole component had been detected by cobe / dmr .",
    "our goal is to place new and accurate limits on the cell size of a small universe using the harmonic decomposition technique to obtain the data power spectrum ( grski , 1994 ) and likelihood technique ( bunn and sugiyama , 1994 ) to constrain @xmath11 .",
    "the method that we use to constrain the parameter @xmath11 is quite different from previous work .",
    "the method adopted by stevens et al .",
    "( 1993 ) constrains the cell size based in the power spectrum of the cmb ; they graphically compare the power spectrum of the standard model with the power spectrum expected for the small universe , normalizing to the @xmath21 component .",
    "jing and fang ( 1994 ) adopt a different approach : they constrain the cell size using the correlation function of the cmb and making the approximation that bins of the correlation function are uncorrelated .",
    "our analysis , however , is exact .",
    "we compute the full covariance matrix for all multipole components and use this covariance matrix to make a @xmath22 fit of the power spectrum extracted from the 2 years of cobe / dmr data to the power spectrum expected for a small universe with different cell sizes @xmath12 . for simplicity ,",
    "we limit our calculation to the case of a @xmath8 cubic universe .",
    "we present , in the next sections , a description of the power spectrum expected in a @xmath8 cubic universe model and the likelihood technique used to constrain @xmath11 .",
    "if the density fluctuations are adiabatic and the universe is spatially flat , the sachs - wolfe fluctuations in the cmb are given by ( , ) = - _ * k * e^i*k * ( peebles , 1982 ) , where @xmath23 is a vector with length @xmath24 that is pointed in the direction of observation ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 is the hubble constant ( written here as @xmath27  km / s / mpc ) and @xmath28 is the density fluctuation in fourier space with the sum taken over all wave numbers * k*.    it is customary to expand the cmb anisotropy in spherical harmonics ( , ) = _ l=0^ _ m =- l^l a_lm y_lm ( ) , where @xmath29 are the spherical harmonic coefficients and @xmath30 is the unit vector in direction @xmath23 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 are given by a_lm = -2i^l _ * k * j_l(ky ) y_lm^ * ( ) , where @xmath31 are spherical bessel functions of order @xmath32 .",
    "if we assume that the cmb anisotropy is a gaussian random field , the coefficients @xmath29 are independent gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance | a_lm |^2 = 16_*k * j_l^2(ky ) ( fang and mo , 1987 ; stevens et al . , 1993 ) . assuming a power - law power spectrum with shape @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the amplitude of scalar perturbations and @xmath35 the spectral index , it is possible to perform the sum in ( [ almvariance ] ) , replacing it by an integral , and to obtain |",
    "a_lm |^2 = c_2   ( see e.g. bond and efsthatiou , 1987 ) . in the literature ,",
    "the average over the canonical ensemble of universes @xmath36 is usually denoted by c_l    the rms temperature fluctuation by @xmath37 .",
    "note that in a euclidean topology the sachs - wolfe spectrum @xmath38 is an integral over the power spectrum ; however , in the @xmath8 universe this is not the case . in this model ,",
    "only wave numbers that are harmonics of the cell size are allowed .",
    "we have a discrete @xmath39 spectrum ^2 = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 ( ) ^2 p^2_i ( sokolov , 1993 ) , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the dimensions of the cell and @xmath43 are integers . for simplicity , assuming @xmath13 and the same power - law power spectrum cited before , eq .",
    "( [ almvariance ] ) can be written as |",
    "|^2 = _ p_x _ p_y _ p_z ( ) ^4-n j_l^2 ( ) , where @xmath44 .",
    "according to ( [ almsu ] ) , the @xmath32th multipole of the cmb temperature is function of the ratio @xmath11 .",
    "this shows that the more multipole components we use in our fit , the stronger our constraints on the cell size will be .",
    "however , we can not use an infinite number of multipole components .",
    "the maximum number of multipole components , @xmath45 , will be limited by two things : the limit where the map is noise dominated and the limit where we can truncate the fourier series without compromising the harmonic decomposition technique ( see grski , 1994 ) .",
    "( [ almsu ] ) , we calculated the expected power spectrum for a @xmath8 universe with different cell sizes @xmath11 from 0.1 to 3.0 , @xmath1 and @xmath46 , where @xmath46 is the limit at which we truncate our data power spectrum . in figure  1",
    ", we plot @xmath47 versus @xmath32 and normalize all values to the last multipole component @xmath48 .",
    "note that for very small cells ( @xmath49 ) , the low order multipoles are suppressed .",
    "the power spectrum for small cells ( as @xmath50 , @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) shows the presence of  bumps \" that disappear as the cell size increases ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the power spectrum finally becomes flat for large cell sizes ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these  bumps \" can be explained if we remember that only the harmonics of the cell size are allowed to be part of the sum in ( [ almsu ] ) .",
    "when the cell size is small there are fewer modes of resonance , and no modes larger than the cell size appear in the sum in ( [ almsu ] ) . as the cell size increases , the sum approaches an integral and the @xmath8 power spectrum becomes flat .",
    "we restrict our analysis to @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption , however , does not weaken our results , since the @xmath8 model with other @xmath35-values tends to fit the data as poorly as with @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , we obtain the maximum likelihood at the same ratio @xmath11 for @xmath1 and @xmath55 .",
    "this happens because the  bumps \" , and not the overall slope , are responsible for the disagreement between the model and the data .",
    "each dmr sky map is composed of @xmath56 pixels and each pixel @xmath57 contains a measurement of the sky temperature at position @xmath58 . considering that the temperatures are smoothed by the dmr beam and contaminated with noise ,",
    "the sky temperatures are described by ( ) _ i = _ lm",
    "a_lm b_l y_lm(_i ) + n_i , where @xmath59 is the dmr beam pattern and @xmath60 is the noise in pixel @xmath57 .",
    "we use the values of @xmath59 given by wright et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , which describes the actual beam pattern of the dmr horns , an imperfect gaussian beam .",
    "we model the quantities @xmath60 in ( [ deltatobserved ] ) as gaussian random variables with mean @xmath61 and variance @xmath62 , assuming uncorrelated pixel noise ( lineweaver et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "when we have all sky coverage , the @xmath29 coefficients are given by a_lm = _ 4 ( ) y_lm^ * ( ) d. in the real sky maps , we do not have all sky coverage .",
    "because of the uncertainty in galaxy emission , we are forced to remove all pixels between @xmath63 below and above the galaxy plane .",
    "this cut represents a loss of almost 34% of all sky pixels and destroys the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics . replacing the integral in ( [ almcoeff ] ) by a sum over the number of pixels that remain in the sky map after the galaxy cut , @xmath64",
    ", we define a new set of coefficients by b_lm w _ i=1^n_pix ( ) _ i y_lm^*(_i ) , where the normalization is chosen to be @xmath65 . substituting ( [ deltatobserved ] ) into ( [ blmobserved ] )",
    ", we obtain b_lm = _ l_1m_1 a_l_1m_1 b_l_1 w_ll_1mm_1 + w _",
    "i=1^n_pix n_i y_lm^*(_i ) , with covariance @xmath66 where w_ll_1mm_1 w _",

    "defining our multipole estimates as c_l^dmr _",

    "mm b_lm b_lm^ * ^2 .",
    "the @xmath68 coefficients are not good estimates of the true multipole moments @xmath38 .",
    "however , they are useful for constraining our cosmological parameters .    the likelihood and the @xmath22 are , respectively , defined by -2 = ^2 + |*m*| and ^2 ^t * m*^-1 * c * , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath45-dimensional row and column vectors with entries @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the covariance matrix as described in ( [ clvariance ] ) with dimensions @xmath45 x @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath73 denotes the @xmath68-coefficients actually extracted from the data .",
    "because the perturbations depend on an unknown constant @xmath34 , the power spectrum normalization , we have to constrain two parameters at once . in practice , this calculation is done by fixing the ratio @xmath11 and changing the normalization by a small factor .",
    "we multiply the first term on the right side of ( [ blmvariance ] ) by this factor and calculate a new covariance matrix . repeating this procedure for each cell size",
    ", we finally get a likelihood grid that constrains the ratio @xmath11 and the normalization parameter .",
    "in figure  2 , we show the angular power spectrum @xmath73 extracted from the data .",
    "we use a 2-year combined 53 plus 90  ghz map , with galaxy cut of @xmath63 , monopole and dipole removed .",
    "we plot @xmath74 versus @xmath32 from @xmath75 to @xmath48 , with bias ( @xmath76 ) removed and error bars given by the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix @xmath67 . in computing the bias and error bars ,",
    "we assume eq .",
    "( [ almpadrao ] ) with @xmath1 .",
    "the shape of this power spectrum and its multipole values are consistent with values reported by wright et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , and for @xmath77 the power spectrum is basically dominated by noise .",
    "we computed the likelihood function @xmath78 , using it to constrain the ratio @xmath11 and the normalization @xmath79 , where @xmath79 is the rms variance at @xmath80 .",
    "for the data set described above , we found the maximum likelihood at @xmath81 . in figure  3 , we plot the likelihood function @xmath78 .",
    "notice that the likelihoods can not be normalized because they do not converge to zero for very large cell sizes , i.e. , the volume under the likelihood function is infinite .",
    "since the likelihoods are not zero for very large cell sizes , we could naively consider that the probability of the universe being small is essentially zero .",
    "however , this conclusion is clearly exaggerated and based on the fact that we multiplied our likelihoods by a uniform prior , and there is nothing special about adopting a uniform prior . in order to obtain rigorous confidence limits for our analysis",
    ", we replace the maximum likelihood fit by a minimum @xmath22 fit .",
    "we compute the chi - squared function @xmath82 and use it to constrain the ratio @xmath11 and the normalization @xmath79 . in figure  4 , we plot the probability that the @xmath8 model is consistent with the data as a function of the ratio @xmath11 and the normalization @xmath79 ( bottom ) .",
    "confidence limits of 68% , 95% and 99.7% are shown in the contour plot ( top ) .",
    "we found the highest consistency probability ( minimum @xmath22 ) at @xmath83 , represented by a cross in the contour plot . removing the quadrupole",
    ", we obtained similar results , see table  1 for the lower limits on cell sizes .",
    "we obtain the constraint @xmath84 at 95% confidence .",
    "we can not place an upper limit on the cell size : all large cells are equally probable .",
    "the strong constraint from our analysis comes from the predicted power spectrum of the @xmath8 universe ; see figure  1 . according to this plot",
    ", a reduction in the cell size to values below the horizon scale should suppress the quadrupole and low multipole anisotropies , while the suppression is negligible if the cell is very large , at least , larger than the horizon .",
    "it is possible to notice these properties in figures  3 and  4 : both favor large cell sizes .",
    "the observed presence of the quadrupole and other low order anisotropies automatically constrains our cell to be very large . in other words , even before making the @xmath22 fit , we expect to obtain very large cells .",
    "we remind the reader that our analysis is for @xmath1 .",
    "we made this assumption because the results of fitting the @xmath8 model seem to be relatively insensitive to changes in @xmath35 and the  bumps \" , not the overall slope , are responsible for the poor fit between the model and the data .",
    "in other words , our results are independent of any particular inflationary model .    from the cobe / dmr data , we obtain the best @xmath22 fit for a toroidal universe with @xmath85 , which corresponds to a cell size of @xmath86mpc . a cell size below 72% of the size of the horizon ( @xmath87 ) is incompatible with the cobe measurements at 95% confidence , and a cell size below the size of the horizon ( @xmath88 )",
    "is ruled out at 68% confidence .",
    "since the @xmath8 topology is interesting if the cell size is considerably smaller than the horizon , this model loses most of its appeal .",
