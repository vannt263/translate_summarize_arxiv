    "optical two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) has been a major source of continuous - variable entanglement for quantum communication @xcite . in recent years , intriguing applications such as quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite have been demonstrated experimentally with tmsv .",
    "theoretically , it is also known that tmsv maximizes the epr correlation when a fixed amount of entanglement is given @xcite . in order to exploit fully the non - classical properties of such entangled light fields ,",
    "it is important to understand decoherence effects as they propagate through noisy environments @xcite .",
    "this belongs to a more subtle topic involving the characterization and quantification of mixed state entanglement in general .    for bipartite systems , peres and horodecki",
    "have developed a powerful criterion of entanglement , which is known as the ppt ( positive partial transposition ) criterion @xcite .",
    "if the partial transposition of a density matrix ( denoted by @xmath1 ) has one or more negative eigenvalues , then the state is an entangled state .",
    "physically , the partial transposition for separable states can be considered as a time - reversal operation , and one can construct a variety of uncertainty relations serving as indicators of entanglement @xcite . for two - mode gaussian states such as tmsv , ppt provides a necessary and sufficient condition of separability @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of disentanglement of tmsv in various noisy situations has been addressed by several authors recently @xcite .",
    "the fact that an amplitude damped tmsv remains gaussian enables an elegant description of entanglement based on the properties of covariance matrix associated with the density operators @xcite .",
    "in particular , from the time - dependent solution of wigner function @xcite or the corresponding characteristic function @xcite , one can quantify the degradation of entanglement by calculating the negativity @xcite and relative entropy @xcite .",
    "it is now known that for an initial tmsv at a non - zero thermal bath , quantum entanglement vanishes completely in a finite time @xcite .",
    "however , we notice that there are much less investigations addressing the structure of @xmath1 directly , and yet @xmath1 is what the ppt criterion originally based upon .",
    "since @xmath1 could manifest differently in various basis , the study of @xmath1 in fock space , for example , could reveal entanglement properties not easily found by the wigner function method @xcite .",
    "an example we notice is the construction of entanglement witness operators via the projectors formed by the eigenvectors of @xmath1 with negative eigenvalues @xcite . such entanglement witness operators , which correspond a variety of observables for the detection of entanglement , are determined by @xmath1 .    the main purpose of this paper to indicate some key features of decohered entanglement as revealed by eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath1 .",
    "our analysis will concentrate on the structures of eigenvectors in fock space , which is also where interesting non - local correlations of continuous - variable systems can be observed @xcite . for a tmsv under the influence of amplitude damping ( or gaining in an amplifier ) , we solve for the time evolution of @xmath0 and determine the exact eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath1 analytically .",
    "these eigenvectors are shown to have a strong correlation in photon numbers , and hence @xmath1 is a block diagonal matrix in fock space .",
    "therefore witness operators associated with each block involve only a finite number of fock vectors , which implies that the detection of entanglement can only require a small portion of the hilbert space .",
    "this is in contrast to entanglement detection based on uncertainty relations in which the entire hilbert space is usually involved @xcite . in this sense",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath1 access the entanglement signatures ` locally ' , which is a complement to ` global ' characterization ( of gaussian states ) using covariance matrices . as we shall see below , as long as the initial state is a tmsv , the corresponding eigenvectors do not change with time , indicating that the entanglement carried by tmsv is robust against amplitude damping .",
    "to begin with , we consider the time evolution of an initial tmsv , each coupled with a separate phase - insensitive linear bath . in terms of the annihilation operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the two modes , the master equation governing the dynamical process is @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the gain and loss parameters respectively , both having a dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the master equation describes amplifying or damping effects due to the coupling with the baths . for dissipation in thermal baths , each of temperature @xmath8",

    "we focus on the initial tmsv with the squeezing parameter @xmath14 : @xmath15      \\left|00\\right\\rangle= \\sqrt{1-\\lambda^2 } \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0 }      \\lambda ^n \\left|nn\\right\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the two - mode vacuum state .       the sub - matrix structure of @xmath1 , with initial tmsv , in the fock basis.,width=7 ]    to investigate the entanglement properties of the density matrix @xmath0 , we study its partial transposition @xmath1 .",
