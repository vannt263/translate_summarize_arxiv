    "this appendix contains the proof of theorem  1 : _ every reversible transformation on a system comprising @xmath0 subsystems in boxworld , with @xmath116 measurements at every subsystem each having @xmath2 outcomes , is a permutation of subsystems , followed by local operations . _",
    "the proof idea is the same as in the case @xmath21 : find a particular representation of the vectors @xmath135 and @xmath100 ( corresponding to the previous vectors @xmath26 , @xmath38 , @xmath115 and @xmath32 and @xmath100 ) such that reversible transformations are orthogonal , and such that the scalar products of those vectors yield useful invariants .",
    "we recall that the dual of reversible transformations preserve the cone of effects and so permute extremal effects ( this is lemma  2 applied to this case ) .          rather than giving the vectors explicitly ,",
    "we construct them implicitly from the standard @xmath0-simplex in @xmath143 : let @xmath144 be the @xmath11th standard unit vector in @xmath143 , and @xmath145 the center of those vectors , that is @xmath146 . define @xmath147 ,",
    "so that the angles between those vectors ( @xmath140 ) are @xmath148 . by construction , we have @xmath149 , so the vectors are linearly dependent .",
    "the set @xmath137 are then the vectors resulting from embedding normalized versions of the @xmath150s isometrically into @xmath138 .",
    "the first two claimed equalities follow immediately .",
    "the third can be confirmed by computing . ]",
    "@xmath151 which involves only scalar products of the form @xmath152 .",
    "we choose these in a particular way in order to simplify the subsequent argument : the single - site effects will be vectors in @xmath157 .",
    "let @xmath158 denote the @xmath118th standard unit vector in @xmath159 , and @xmath100 be the unit vector on the direct sum space , @xmath160 .",
    "then , define @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "useful properties of these vectors are given in the following lemma .",
    "since @xmath112 and @xmath113 factorize , we can compute the inner product @xmath173 termwise .",
    "let @xmath11 be the site where @xmath112 and @xmath113 differ , and let @xmath174 and @xmath175 be the corresponding factors .",
    "first , consider the case that @xmath174 and @xmath175 represent different outcomes of the _ same _ measurement .",
    "then , the inner product is the negative value @xmath176 which is the smallest value that can possibly be attained .",
    "hence @xmath177 has the same value , such that @xmath171 and @xmath172 also differ at a single site only ( where they refer to different outcomes of the same measurement ) .",
    "the alternative case is where @xmath174 and @xmath175 represent outcomes of _ different _ measurements .",
    "note that @xmath178 and hence @xmath179 . since @xmath78 preserves @xmath180 and maps the cone bijectively to itself ( cf .",
    "lemma  2 ) , we have @xmath181 , from which it follows that @xmath171 and @xmath172 correspond to outcomes of different measurements on at least one factor .",
    "furthermore , @xmath182 is preserved .",
    "this is the largest value that can be attained subject to the constraint that they represent outcomes of different measurements on at least one factor .",
    "it follows that @xmath171 and @xmath183 are identical in all but one tensor factor .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 is now completed using some properties of the hamming distance .",
    "the list of local effects ( listing the measurement - outcome pairs at the successive sites ) can be used to form a string in @xmath184 , where @xmath185 .",
    "the hamming distance between two strings , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , is defined by @xmath186 lemma  [ lem:6 ] shows that if @xmath170 are two arbitrary extremal effects with @xmath187 , then the transformed effects satisfy @xmath188 .",
    "in fact , all reversible operations that preserve hamming distance 1 preserve the hamming distance between all effects .",
    "furthermore , the set of hamming distance preserving transformations can be expressed as combinations of permutations of subsystems and local permutations ( see for example theorem  3.54 of  @xcite ) .",
    "we give a proof of this for completeness .",
    "[ lem:8 ] let @xmath189 be a finite alphabet , with @xmath190 the set of length-@xmath0 words .",
    "further , let @xmath191 be the set of permutations of letters and @xmath192 be the group of local transformations of @xmath190 , which act independently at each position .        for @xmath202 ,",
    "consider the set , @xmath203 of words of the form @xmath204 i.e.  @xmath51 and strings that differ from @xmath51 only at position @xmath11 . because the elements of @xmath203 all have mutual hamming distance equal to one , there must be a function @xmath205 such that @xmath206 .",
    "since @xmath78 is invertible , @xmath205 is a permutation , which may be thought of as an element of @xmath196 . because @xmath207 for all @xmath11 , there is no loss of generality in assuming that @xmath78 takes @xmath203 to itself . employing yet another local operation if necessary , we may even assume that @xmath71 acts like identity on all elements of @xmath203 , and hence on all strings with hamming distance 1 to @xmath51 .",
    "define the _ weight _ of an element @xmath208 to be @xmath209 .",
    "what we have shown so far amounts to the fact that @xmath78 fixes all words of weight zero and one .",
    "next , we prove by induction that @xmath78 fixes the words of any weight @xmath210 ( and hence all of @xmath211 .",
    "assume the claim has been established for weights up to @xmath212 .",
    "if @xmath213 has weight @xmath214 , it is uniquely specified by the @xmath210 words @xmath215 which have weight @xmath216 and hamming distance @xmath217 to @xmath213 ( in fact , any two words @xmath218 from this set are sufficient to specify @xmath213 ) .",
    "but since the weights of all of the @xmath215 , and @xmath219 are preserved by @xmath78 by the induction hypothesis , @xmath78 must fix @xmath213 .",
    "it follows that all transformations in boxworld can be formed by composing subsystem permutations and local permutations .",
    "however , the set of allowed local permutations is further restricted ( hamming distance preservation is a necessary but not sufficient condition on @xmath78 ) :    [ lem:9 ] the only local reversible operations allowed in boxworld are relabellings of measurements and their outcomes ( separately for each measurement ) . furthermore , all possible local relabellings are allowed transformations , regardless of the total number of subsystems , @xmath0 .",
    "recall   and note that these are the only combinations of extremal effects that sum to @xmath100 : otherwise the identity @xmath100 could be decomposed into a sum involving two effects @xmath135 and @xmath220 with @xmath221 , so there would be a state @xmath51 with @xmath222 , for which @xmath223 , a contradiction .",
    "consider a measurement @xmath118 , then @xmath224 so each member of @xmath225 must correspond to the same measurement .",
    "hence all local reversible adjoint transformations permute the measurements , and , for each measurement separately , permute the outcomes .    to see that all permutations are allowed if the number of outcomes @xmath4 is the same for every measurement @xmath118 , note that the representation of @xmath135 as in  ( [ eq : repxm ] ) on @xmath226 permits that all those permutations are implemented as allowed linear ( hence orthogonal ) transformations : relabelling the measurements corresponds to permuting the standard unit vectors @xmath158 of @xmath159 ( constituting an @xmath3-dimensional irreducible representation of the symmetric group @xmath227 ) , while relabelling the outcomes corresponds to symmetry transformations of the @xmath228-simplex in @xmath229 with @xmath4 vertices @xmath230 ( a @xmath228-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath231 ) .",
    "in the case that the number of outcomes @xmath232 depends on the measurement @xmath118 , the vector space carrying the local effects will analogously be @xmath233 .",
    "this allows us to represent the permutation of outcomes linearly , as before , while the permutations of measurements @xmath118 and @xmath234 with @xmath235 correspond to permutations of direct summands .",
    "we have thus proven that every local relabelling transformation @xmath78 is an allowed transformation in boxworld .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath78 is allowed if the single system is coupled to others ( i.e.  that @xmath236 is an allowed transformation ) .",
    "( the analogue in quantum theory is to prove complete positivity ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that local relabellings preserve the no - signalling , positivity and normalization constraints , such that @xmath237 maps the no - signalling polytope ( that is , the state space ) onto itself .    in the final part of the appendix",
    ", we prove that a state @xmath51 is a pure product state if and only if all the probabilities @xmath238 are either @xmath239 or @xmath28 with respect to extremal effects , @xmath96 ( in the most general case that the number of measurements and outcomes varies from site to site ) .",
    "this has been used in the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "+    [ lem : extremal01 ] let @xmath240 be a normalized state on @xmath0 arbitrary boxworld subsystems ( some of which may be classical ) .",
    "then , @xmath51 is a pure product state if and only if @xmath126 for all extremal effects @xmath241 .    if @xmath124 is a product of pure states , then @xmath242 for every @xmath11 , such that @xmath243 is either @xmath239 or @xmath28 .",
    "it remains to prove the converse .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 is any state with @xmath126 for all @xmath88 .",
    "the idea is to construct a pure product state @xmath244 with @xmath245 for all @xmath96 , which proves that @xmath246 . to this end , note that the decomposition of the identity given in   has the following generalization : if the @xmath247 are arbitrary local measurement devices , then @xmath248 where the sum is over all outcomes ( the number of outcomes may depend on the measurement ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath249 so exactly one of the addends must be @xmath28 , while all others are @xmath239 .",
    "hence , to every string @xmath250 describing local choices of measurements , there is a unique string of corresponding outcomes @xmath251 such that @xmath252 , while the inner product is @xmath239 for all other outcome combinations .",
    "it remains to show that each @xmath253 only depends on @xmath247 ; in this case , we can construct a state @xmath254 , generating the same probabilities as @xmath51 , factor by factor .",
    "so suppose there were strings @xmath255 and @xmath256 with @xmath257 , but @xmath258 , ( where @xmath259 ) then @xmath260 where the last inequality follows by applying the decomposition of the identity   to @xmath261 factors .",

    "<S> . it will be convenient to use a specific representation of @xmath26 , @xmath38 and @xmath100 : @xmath101    _ _ lemma 3.__|with respect to the representation above , it holds that any reversible transformation @xmath71 is orthogonal , i.e.  on @xmath0 subsystems , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the @xmath104-dimensional identity matrix .    first observe that with this choice , @xmath105 and hence ( since @xmath43 factorizes ) @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then , since @xmath78 permutes the extremal effects , @xmath107 .    the fact that @xmath71 ( and thus @xmath78 ) is orthogonal , gives rise to a host of invariants . </S>",
    "<S> if one picks any two extremal effects @xmath108 , then clearly their inner product is a conserved quantity : @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the _ hamming distance _ between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e.  the number of places at which @xmath112 and @xmath113 differ . thus the hamming distance of extremal effects is a conserved quantity : @xmath114 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known in the theory of error correction  @xcite that the set of maps on finite strings which preserve the hamming distance is highly restricted : the group of those maps is generated by local transformations and permutations of sites only ( for a proof , see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath78 acts as such an operation on @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the states in @xmath43 span the entire space , the action on this set is sufficient to completely specify @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is straightforward to show that the set of allowed local operations comprises exchanging @xmath26 and @xmath38 ( relabelling measurements ) , exchanging @xmath26 and @xmath115 ( relabelling the outcome upon input @xmath26 ) , exchanging @xmath38 and @xmath32 ( relabelling the outcome upon input @xmath38 ) and combinations thereof ( see lemma  [ lem:9 ] in the appendix , for a proof in the general case ) .    _ _ main results.__|combining all the previous results proves the following theorem in the special case of @xmath6 measurements with @xmath7 outcomes ( a full proof for all @xmath116 and @xmath2 is given in the appendix ) :    _ _ theorem 1.__|every reversible transformation on a system comprising @xmath0 subsystems in boxworld , with @xmath116 measurements at every subsystem each having @xmath2 outcomes , is a permutation of subsystems , followed by local relabellings of measurements and their outcomes .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show the following :    _ _ theorem 2.__|in boxworld , every reversible transformation maps pure product states to pure product states . this is true even if the system is coupled to an arbitrary number of classical systems , and if the number of devices and outcomes varies from subsystem to subsystem .    before giving the proof , we need to slightly extend the notion of outcome vectors to the general case . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the set of extremal effects for the @xmath11th subsystem by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 labels the measurements ( the number of different @xmath118s may depend on @xmath11 ) and @xmath119 the corresponding outcomes ( the number of different @xmath119s may depend on @xmath118 and on @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these vectors satisfy @xmath120 , where @xmath121 represents the identity . except for these relations , </S>",
    "<S> no linear dependencies occur .    </S>",
    "<S> the identity on the full system is then @xmath122 , and the extremal effects are @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> the convex cone @xmath47 and the state space @xmath50 are defined analogously to the binary case previously described . </S>",
    "<S> the statements and proofs of lemmas  1 and  2 remain valid in this more general case , hence , in particular , adjoint reversible transformations map @xmath43 onto itself .    to complete the proof of theorem  2 , note that a state @xmath75 is a pure product state ( that is , of the form @xmath124 , where all @xmath125 are pure ) if and only if @xmath126 for all extremal effects @xmath88 ( a proof is given in lemma  [ lem : extremal01 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath51 is a pure product state and @xmath71 a reversible transformation , then @xmath127 which proves that @xmath128 must also be a pure product state .    </S>",
    "<S> note that theorem  1 does not , in general , apply to the case of site - dependent numbers of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , suppose that we have two sites , where the first has two binary measurements , @xmath26 and @xmath38 , and the second allows only a single binary measurement , @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in other words , a gbit is coupled to a classical bit . ) </S>",
    "<S> it is then straightforward to construct a reversible cnot operation , where the classical bit is the control bit . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there is an adjoint reversible transformation that acts as @xmath130 for all @xmath131 .    in the case of a system composed of several classical subsystems , </S>",
    "<S> theorem  1 also does not hold|the dynamics in such a case is non - trivial . nevertheless , theorem  2 does apply to this case|it remains impossible to prepare entangled states from separable ones .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions.__|we have shown that the set of reversible operations in boxworld is trivial : the only possible operations relabel subsystems , local measurements and their outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there is no boxworld analogue of an entangling unitary in quantum theory , one can not reversibly prepare non - local states from separable ones , nor perform useful computations reversibly .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the results have consequences for the interplay between dynamics and measurements in boxworld : suppose we have a system comprising a particle , @xmath96 , and two observers , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , initially in an uncorrelated tripartite product state . in quantum theory , if @xmath132 measures @xmath96 , but @xmath133 does not take part in the interaction , then @xmath133 can model the corresponding dynamics by a unitary transformation on the @xmath134-system . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath133 can view the whole interaction as reversible while retaining the ability to correctly predict the outcome probabilities of any future measurements . </S>",
    "<S> ( theories with such a property might be called _ </S>",
    "<S> fundamentally reversible_. ) in boxworld , on the other hand , this is not true : @xmath132 s measurement on @xmath96 would have to create correlations between @xmath96 and @xmath132 , but this could never be achieved by a reversible transformation . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath133 would have to model the @xmath134-measurement using irreversible dynamics , even if @xmath133 did not take part in the interaction itself .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to extend our result to explore which state spaces are compatible with fundamentally reversible theories in this sense , or with theories that are _ transitive _ , i.e.  that every pure state can be reversibly mapped to any other . </S>",
    "<S> this property has been used by hardy as an axiom for quantum theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both conditions seem to strongly restrict the possible geometry of the state space , and an interesting open question is how non - local such theories can be .    _ </S>",
