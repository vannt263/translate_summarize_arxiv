    "following standard notations , for any family of graphs @xmath1 and any graph @xmath2 , we write @xmath11 if any colouring of the edges of @xmath4 with 2 colours , red and blue , yields a red copy of some graph from @xmath1 or a blue copy of @xmath2 . for simplicity , we write @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "we define the _ size - ramsey number _ of the pair @xmath16 as @xmath17 and again , for simplicity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "one of the most studied directions in this area is the size - ramsey number of @xmath20 , a path on @xmath21 vertices .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath22 and that @xmath23 ( for example , @xmath24 ) , but the exact behaviour of @xmath25 was not known for a long time . in fact , erds  @xcite offered $ 100 for a proof or disproof that @xmath26 this problem was solved by beck  @xcite in 1983 who , quite surprisingly , showed that @xmath27 .",
    "( each time we refer to inequality such as this one , we mean that the inequality holds for sufficiently large @xmath21 . )",
    "a variant of his proof , provided by bollobs  @xcite , gives @xmath28 .",
    "very recently , different and more elementary arguments were used by the first and the third author of this paper  @xcite , and by letzter  @xcite that show that @xmath29  @xcite , @xmath30  @xcite , and @xmath31  @xcite . on the other hand , the first nontrivial lower bound",
    "was provided by beck  @xcite and his result was subsequently improved by bollobs  @xcite who showed that @xmath32 ; today we know that @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "for any @xmath34 , let @xmath6 be the family of cycles of length at most @xmath7 . in this paper , we continue to use similar ideas as in  @xcite to deal with @xmath35",
    ". such techniques ( very simple but quite powerful ) were used for the first time in  @xcite ; see also recent book  @xcite that covers several tools including this one .",
    "corresponding theorems use different approaches and different probability spaces that might be interesting on their own rights .",
    "some non - trivial lower bounds are provided as well . in particular , it is shown that @xmath36 for sufficiently large  @xmath21 .",
    "we also study @xmath10 and show that for even and sufficiently large @xmath21 we have @xmath37 ( in fact , the lower bound holds for odd values of @xmath21 , too . )",
    "the linearity of @xmath10 also follows from the earlier result of haxell , kohayakawa and uczak  @xcite who proved that the size - ramsey number @xmath38 is linear in @xmath21 .",
    "however , their proof is based on the regularity method and therefore the leading constant is enormous .",
    "let us recall a few classic models of random graphs that we study in this paper .",
    "the _ binomial random graph _",
    "@xmath39 is the random graph @xmath4 with vertex set @xmath40 : = \\ { 1 , 2 , \\ldots , n\\}$ ] in which every pair @xmath41}{2}$ ] appears independently as an edge in @xmath4 with probability  @xmath42 .",
    "the _ binomial random bipartite graph _",
    "@xmath43 is the random bipartite graph @xmath44 with partite sets @xmath45 , each of order @xmath21 , in which every pair @xmath46 appears independently as an edge in @xmath4 with probability  @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath47 may ( and usually does ) tend to zero as @xmath21 tends to infinity .",
    "recall that an event in a probability space holds _ asymptotically almost surely _ ( or _ a.a.s .",
    "_ ) if the probability that it holds tends to @xmath48 as @xmath21 goes to infinity . since we aim for results that hold a.a.s .",
    ", we will always assume that @xmath21 is large enough .",
    "another probability space that we are interested in is the probability space of random @xmath49-regular graphs with uniform probability distribution .",
    "this space is denoted @xmath50 , and asymptotics are for @xmath51 with @xmath52 fixed , and @xmath21 even if @xmath49 is odd .    instead of working directly in the uniform probability space of random regular graphs on @xmath21 vertices @xmath50 , we use the _ pairing model _ ( also known as the _ configuration model _ ) of random regular graphs , first introduced by bollobs  @xcite , which is described next .",
    "suppose that @xmath53 is even , as in the case of random regular graphs , and consider @xmath53 points partitioned into @xmath21 labelled buckets @xmath54 of @xmath49 points each .",
    "a _ pairing _ of these points is a perfect matching into @xmath55 pairs .",
    "given a pairing @xmath56 , we may construct a multigraph @xmath57 , with loops allowed , as follows : the vertices are the buckets @xmath58 , and a pair @xmath59 in @xmath56 corresponds to an edge @xmath60 in @xmath57 if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are contained in the buckets @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "it is an easy fact that the probability of a random pairing corresponding to a given simple graph @xmath4 is independent of the graph , hence the restriction of the probability space of random pairings to simple graphs is precisely @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , it is well known that a random pairing generates a simple graph with probability asymptotic to @xmath65 depending on @xmath49 , so that any event holding a.a.s .  over the probability space of random pairings also holds a.a.s .  over the corresponding space @xmath50 . for this reason ,",
    "asymptotic results over random pairings suffice for our purposes . for more information on this model ,",
    "see , for example , the survey of wormald  @xcite .",
    "also , we will be using the following well - known concentration inequality .",
    "let @xmath66 be a random variable with the binomial distribution with parameters @xmath21 and @xmath42 .",
    "then , a consequence of chernoff s bound ( see , for example , theorem  2.1 in  @xcite ) is that for any @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 .    for simplicity , we do not round numbers that are supposed to be integers either up or down ; this is justified since these rounding errors are negligible to the asymptomatic calculations we will make .",
    "finally , we use @xmath70 to denote natural logarithms .",
    "in this section , we will use the following observation .    [",
    "lem : determ_upperbound1 ] let @xmath34 and let @xmath4 be a graph of order @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that for every two disjoint sets of vertices @xmath72 and @xmath73 such that @xmath74 we have @xmath75 .",
    "then , @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be any graph of order @xmath71 with the desired expansion properties .",
    "consider any red - blue colouring of the edges of a graph , and suppose that there is no blue copy of  @xmath20 .",
    "our goal is to show that there must be a red cycle of length at most @xmath7 .",
    "we perform the following algorithm on @xmath4 to construct a blue path @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath78 be an arbitrary vertex of @xmath4 , let @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "we investigate all edges from @xmath78 to @xmath72 searching for a blue edge . if such an edge is found ( say from @xmath78 to @xmath82 ) , we extend the blue path as @xmath83 and remove @xmath82 from @xmath72 .",
    "we continue extending the blue path @xmath56 this way for as long as possible .",
    "since there is no monochromatic @xmath20 , we must reach a point of the process in which @xmath56 can not be extended , that is , there is a blue path from @xmath78 to @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) and there is no blue edge from @xmath84 to @xmath72 .",
    "this time , @xmath84 is moved to @xmath73 and we try to continue extending the path from @xmath86 , reaching another critical point in which another vertex will be moved to @xmath73 , etc . if @xmath56 is reduced to a single vertex @xmath78 and no blue edge to @xmath72 is found , we move @xmath78 to @xmath73 and simply restart the process from another vertex from @xmath72 , again arbitrarily chosen .",
    "an obvious but important observation is that during this algorithm there is never a blue edge between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , in each step of the process , the size of @xmath72 decreases by 1 or the size of @xmath73 increases by 1 .",
    "finally , since there is no monochromatic @xmath20 , the number of vertices of the blue path @xmath56 is always smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "hence , at some point of the process both @xmath72 and @xmath73 must have size at least @xmath87 .",
    "now , if needed , we remove some vertices from @xmath72 or @xmath73 so that both sets have size precisely @xmath87 .",
    "finally , it follows from the expansion property of @xmath4 that @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath88 $ ] ( the graph induced by @xmath89 ) , which consists only of red edges , is not a forest and so must contain a red cycle . the proof is finished .",
