    "the semibosonized nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) ( often is called as the chiral quark soliton model )  @xcite is very successful in describing the static properties of the nucleon such as the mass splitting of the nucleon and @xmath5 isobar , axial constants  @xcite , magnetic moments  @xcite , electromagnetic form factors  @xcite , and so on .",

    "@xcite and weigel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the su(3 ) version of the model explains the correct mass splitting of the su(3 ) octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "the model could also reproduce the axial constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 with a remarkable agreement with experiments",
    ". in particular , the finding of the non - commutivity of the collective operators arising from the _ time - ordering _ enabled the model to solve the long - standing problem of the underestimate of the axial coupling constants and nucleon magnetic moments  @xcite in hedgehog models .    in the semibosonized njl model",
    ", the baryon can be understood as @xmath8 valence quarks coupled to the polarized dirac sea bound by a nontrivial chiral back ground field in the hartree approximation .",
    "the proper quantum numbers of baryons are obtained by the semi - classical quantization performed by integrating over zero - mode fluctuations of the pion field around the saddle point .",
    "the merit of the model is to interpolate between the naive quark model and the skyrme model , which enables us to study the interplay between these two models .    in the present work",
    ", we shall investigate the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons in the su(3 ) njl model .",
    "since the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons are experimentally well known , it is a good check for the model to reproduce them .",
    "furthermore , we shall show that the model reaches the upper limit of the accuracy which can be attained in any model with `` _ hedgehog symmetry _ '' .",
    "the outline of the present work is as follows : in the next section , we briefly describe the semibosonized su(3 ) njl model and show how to obtain the magnetic moments in the model . in section 3 , we derive the general relations between magnetic moments of the octet baryons using the symmetry of the model and confront them with experimental data .",
    "we show that subleading @xmath2 and @xmath3 corrections are relatively small , whereas @xmath9 ) ones are fairly large . in section 4 , we discuss the numerical results .",
    "we summarize the present work and draw conclusion in section 5 .",

    ", we have assumed the isospin symmetry .",
    "@xmath20 stands for the dynamical quark mass arising from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , which is in general momentum - dependent  @xcite .",
    "we regard @xmath20 as a constant and employ the proper - time regularization for convenience . the @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) are respectively defined by @xmath23 the operator @xmath24 is expressed in euclidean space in terms of the euclidean time derivative @xmath25 and the dirac one  particle hamiltonian @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the well  known dirac hermitian matrices .",
    "note that the njl model is a low - energy effective model of qcd .",
    "hence , the effective action given by eq .",
    "(  [ eq : action ] ) can include higher order mass terms like @xmath33 .",
    "however , the coefficient in front of @xmath33 is not theoretically known .",
    "is determined by the soft pion theorem . ] to go beyond the linear order of mass corrections , one should justify such a higher order term .",
    "otherwise , it is meaningless to consider higher order mass corrections in the expansion of the quark mass .",
    "therefore , we shall take into account the mass corrections only up to the linear order .",
    "many physical processes ( semileptonic decays , electromagnetic transitions , electromagnetic form factors , etc . ) are described by the one - current baryon matrix element : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a particular dirac matrix depending on the physical observable and @xmath36 is a @xmath0 flavor matrix .",
    "for example , the matrix element in eq.([mat ] ) with @xmath37 is relevant to the electromagnetic form factors of the octet baryons ( magnetic moments , electromagnetic square radii , etc . ) .",
    "this particular matrix element is a subject of the present paper .",
    "one can relate the hadronic matrix element eq.([mat ] ) to a correlation function : @xmath38 at large euclidean time @xmath39 .",
    "the baryon current @xmath40 can be constructed from @xmath8 quark fields , @xmath41 @xmath42 are spin  isospin indices , @xmath43 are color indices , and the matrices @xmath44 are chosen in such a way that the quantum numbers of the corresponding current are equal to @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 annihilates ( creates ) a baryon at large @xmath39 .",
    "the general expression for the matrix elements eq.([mat ] ) was derived in ref .",

    "@xmath60 stands for the anomalous moments of inertia defined in  ref .",
    "recently , @xcite the rotational @xmath1 corrections for matrix elements of vector and axial currents were derived , the general expression ( without any regularization ) for these corrections has a form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a matrix of the moments of inertia for the soliton , @xmath63 is an operator of angular velocities acting on angular variables @xmath64 ( details can be found in @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows we shall use these expressions to calculate the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons .",
    "using the general expressions eq.([general ] ) and eq.([general2 ] ) for the one current baryonic matrix elements , we can express the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons with the @xmath47 and rotational @xmath1 corrections in terms of the dynamic quantities @xmath65 depending on the concrete dynamics of the chiral quark soliton : @xmath66 . \\label{mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced @xmath67 invariant tensors @xmath68 @xmath69 stands for the charge operator in su(3 ) flavor space .",

    "( [ eq : waveftn ] ) .",
    "the dynamic quantities @xmath65 are independent of the hadrons involved .",
    "they have a general structure like : @xmath71 where @xmath72 are spin - isospin operators changing the grand spin of states @xmath73 by @xmath74 or @xmath75 and the double sum runs over all the eigenstates of the quark hamiltonian in the soliton field .",
    "the numerical technique for calculating such a double sum has been developed in @xcite . before we calculate the magnetic moments numerically ,",
    "let us estimate the importance of @xmath1 corrections and the relative size of subleading @xmath2 corrections . to this end",
    "we employ a dynamically independent relations between magnetic moments arising from the `` hedgehog '' symmetry of the model .",
    "hyperon magnetic moments are parametrized ( in our approximation ) by six parameters ( @xmath76 and one parameter is contained in the rotational wave functions ) .",
    "looking upon them as free parameters , we obtain the relations between the hyperon magnetic moments and the magnetic moment of the @xmath77 transition : @xmath78 and one additional relation if we neglect rotational @xmath1 corrections , _",
    "i.e. _ put @xmath79 in eq.([mu ] ) : @xmath80 note that the analogous relations between hyperon magnetic moments was obtained by adkins and nappi @xcite but they did not take into account mass corrections to the rotational baryon wave functions and neglected @xmath1 corrections .",
    "the first relation eq.([first ] ) is trivially fulfilled .",
    "it is an isospin relation and so has no corrections in both @xmath1 and @xmath47 .",
    "the next two relations eq.([second ] ) and eq.([third ] ) empirically gives : @xmath81 respectively , whereas the fourth relation eq.([fourth ] ) gives : @xmath82 we see that the fourth relation eq.([fourth ] ) in which we neglect @xmath1 corrections is badly reproduced by experiment whereas the relations given by eqs.([first],[second],[third ] ) seem to be successful .",
    "the explanation of this difference lies in different large @xmath8 properties of the relations .",
    "these relations have , in principle , corrections of order @xmath83 , @xmath2 and @xmath84 , but in ( [ first],[second],[third ] ) all corrections proportional to any power of @xmath1 are cancelled . hence the relations eqs .",
    "( [ first],[second],[third ] ) are satisfied with the accuracy of the order @xmath2 , while the eq.([fourth ] ) is gratified with the accuracy of @xmath83 . from these estimates",
    "one can conclude that the corrections of order @xmath83 to magnetic moments numerically are large whereas those of the order @xmath2 can be relatively small .",
    "these estimates provide us a lower limit for the systematic errors of computations in any `` hedgehog '' model for baryons by neglecting the non - computed @xmath2 and @xmath84 corrections , since any `` hedgehog '' model fulfills eqs .",
    "( [ first],[second],[third ] ) which are deviated from the experiment by about 15  @xmath4 .",
    "hence such a kind of models can not reproduce the experimental data of magnetic moments better than the above  mentioned limit of @xmath85 .",
    "we shall see that in the njl soliton model the accuracy for the hyperon magnetic moments is very close to its upper limit .",
    "in order to calculate eq.([mu ] ) numerically , we follow the well - known kahana and ripka method  @xcite .    in table 1",
    "we show the dependence of the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons on the constituent quark mass in the chiral limit ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "both of the leading term and the rotational @xmath1 corrections tend to decrease as the constituent quark mass @xmath20 increases . in this limit",
    "the @xmath87-spin symmetry is not broken , so that we have the relations @xmath88 compared to the su(2 ) results , the prediction of the su(3 ) model ( @xmath86 ) for the nucleon is different and seems to be better .",
    "it is due to the fact that in our approach the nucleon possesses the polarized hidden strangeness  @xcite .",
    "the rotational @xmath1 corrections are equally important to the other octet members as shown in table 1 . as a result",
    ", the total rotational @xmath1 corrections contribute to the magnetic moments around @xmath89 .",
    "the symmetry breaking terms , proportional to @xmath47 , lift the @xmath87-spin symmetry .",
    "the @xmath47 corrections arise from the explicit dependence of the baryon matrix elements on the strange quark mass ( second term of eq.([general ] ) ) on the one hand , and on the other hand come from the solitonic rotational wave functions ( details see in refs .",
    "the latter correction appears in each column of table 2 and is equally important as the former one .",
    "it is interesting to compare the njl model with the skyrme model , since these two models are closely related . as ref .",
    "@xcite already made a comparison between the njl model and the skyrme model in case of the @xmath90 .",
    "apparently both models have the same collective operator structures ( see eq.([mu ] ) ) , but the origin of parameters @xmath65 given in eq.([mu ] ) is quite distinct each other . in the njl model , the coefficients @xmath65",
    "include the contribution from the noncommutivity of the collective operators  @xcite while it is absent in the skyrme model , since the lagrangian of the skyrme model is local in contrast to that of the semibosonized njl .",
    "the coefficient @xmath91 in the skyrme model comes from the pseudoscalar mesons dominated by the induced kaon fluctuations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the skyrme model needs explicit vector mesons in addition to pseudoscalar ones  @xcite in order to achieve the same algebraic structure of the collective hamiltonian as it is obtained in the semibosonized njl model with pseudoscalar mesons alone . due to the introduction of vector mesons ,",
    "it is inevitable to import large numbers of parameters into the skyrme model . in table 2",
    ", we compare our results with the skyrme model  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show how large the predicted magnetic moments deviate from the experimental data .",
    "we observe that the @xmath87-spin symmetry is lifted almost equidistantly .",
    "it is due to the fact that we have only taken into account the linear order of the @xmath47 corrections .",
    "however , it is not theoretically justified to consider higher @xmath47 corrections as discussed briefly in section 2 .    on the whole ,",
    "the magnetic moments are in a good agreement with the experimental data within about 15@xmath4 .",
    "we have studied the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons in the framework of the semibosonized su(3 ) njl model , taking into account the rotational @xmath1 corrections and linear @xmath47 corrections .",
    "the only parameter we have in the model is the constituent quark mass @xmath20 which is fixed to @xmath92 by the mass splitting of the su(3 ) baryons .",
    "we have shown that the njl model reproduces the magnetic moments of the su(3 ) octet baryons within about @xmath93 .",
    "the accuracy we have reached is more or less the upper limit which can be attained in any model with `` _ hedgehog symmetry _ '' .",
