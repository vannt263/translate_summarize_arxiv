    "coalescence of any compact objects ( black holes , neutron stars , quark stars ) may release enough energy to power a fireball giving rise to some cosmological gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( paczyski  1986 ) , and the coalescence of strange ( quark ) stars may be especially promising ( haensel et al .",
    "1991 ) , provided that no quark matter is spilled into the environment with dire consequences for the birth rate of neutron stars ( caldwell and friedman  1991 , kluniak  1994 ) .",
    "more detailed motivation and further references can be found in lee and kluniak  ( 1999a ) , where the sph coalescence of a tidally locked neutron star and a black hole is discussed .",
    "lee and kluniak  ( 1999b ) discuss the coalescence of a tidally locked stiff polytrope with a black hole , while sph simulations of non  rotating neutron stars in binary coalescence with black holes have been presented by lee  ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have used the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method ( monaghan  1992 ) for our calculations .",
    "our newtonian code is three dimensional and we include a term in the equations of motion that simulates the loss of angular momentum to gravitational radiation in the binary ( this is calculated in the quadrupole approximation for a point ",
    "mass binary ) .",
    "we also compute the gravitational radiation waveforms emitted during the coalesence , in the quadrupole approximation .",
    "the strange star is modeled with @xmath1 sph particles , and has mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3  km .",
    "the black hole is modeled as a point mass producing a newtonian potential , and we model accretion onto it by placing an absorbing boundary at the schwarzschild radius @xmath4 . for the strange star",
    "we take the equation of state to be @xmath5 , with @xmath6  kg  m@xmath7 .    to perform a dynamical coalescence calculation",
    ", we place the binary components in a close keplerian orbit at a small separation ( a few stellar radii ) and give them the corresponding orbital velocities for point masses .",
    "the strange star is initially spherical and has no spin as seen from an external , inertial reference frame .",
    "the orbit decays through the emission of gravitational waves and because of tidal instabilites of purely newtonian origin ( lai , rasio & shapiro 1993 ) .",
    "here we present the result of one calculation , with an initial mass ratio @xmath8 and initial separation @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is followed for approximately 7  ms .",
    "at the start of the simulation a tidal bulge appears on the strange star as a result of the presence of the black hole companion .",
    "the orbital decay causes the star to overflow its roche lobe , beginning mass transfer within the first orbit .",
    "the star is tidally stretched into a tube of practically uniform thickness , and some matter that moves towards the black hole winds around it and produces a torus ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the outer parts of the star move away from the hole as the stream connecting the two becomes thinner .",
    "small condensations form at regular intervals along the narrow stream ( see panel ( d ) in figure  1 ) , reminiscent of the results of a black hole ",
    "neutron star coalescence for a stiff equation of state ( lee  2000 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the black hole shows a large initial peak at the initial mass transfer episode ( see figure  2 ) , and a subsequent decay , due to the presence of the accretion torus . the small spikes in the curve ( such as the ones visible at @xmath10  ms ) indicate the accretion of small knots along the matter stream coming from the star .    in the accretion disk around the black hole",
    ", the density has dropped below @xmath11 and so this matter behaves as pressure  free dust in orbit about the hole ( for reference , in figure  1 @xmath12 ) . however , in the surviving core , flung to a large distance during the tidal encounter , and in the small condensations seen in the matter stream connecting the two binary components , the density remains above this value , and thus the matter continues to feel hydrodynamic effects . by @xmath13",
    "ms , there are 0.15  solar masses in the system excluding the black hole , and this is roughly evenly divided between matter with densities above and below @xmath11 .",
    "at the end of the calculation we have attempted to obtain an estimate for the amount matter that could be dynamically ejected from the system , by computing the total mechanical energy ( kinetic + gravitational potential ) of the fluid .",
    "we find that @xmath14 could leave the system , and would originate from the outermost section of the largest blob formed at the end of the tidal tail .",
    "the rest of the matter ( @xmath15 ) is gravitationally bound to the black hole , located practically at the center of mass of the system , and which has acquired a kick velocity from the asymmetric interaction ( @xmath16 km  s@xmath17 ) .",
    "some of the matter in the accretion torus has enough angular momentum so as not to be accreted immediatly by the black hole ( i.e. it can remain in orbit in a stable fashion ) , amounting to @xmath18 .",
    "this fluid would presumably be accreted onto the black hole on the viscous time scale as angular momentum is redistributed in the disk .",
