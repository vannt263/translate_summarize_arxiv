    "such a configuration is natural in the degenerate merger models ; in particular , 75 kpc offsets from massive galaxies were predicted from _",
    "ab initio _ binary evolution studies @xcite .",
    "as such , we contend that there is now _ a priori _ precedent to support our claim that @xmath15 hosted the progenitor birth of shb 060502b .    the @xmath15 ",
    "shb060502b configuration shows some striking similarities with the other shbs with putative early - type hosts ( see table [ tab : gang ] ) . not only",
    "would the redshift of @xmath2 be remarkably similar to that of shb 050509b and shb 050724 but the inferred energy would be consistent with that of 050509b . indeed in energy , redshift ,",
    "putative galaxy color and type , and offset scale , shb060502b finds a strong analog in shb050509b .",
    "last , we note that the weak x - ray afterglow and no detected optical afterglow would seem to indicate a low density circumburst environment , as would be expected if the grb originated far from the progenitor birthsite .      with such a large physical offset , the possibility remains that the association with the putative host is coincidental and in fact the grb originates from a different source .",
    "here we discuss a few alternative possibilities for the host galaxy of this grb .",
    "while none of these possibilities can be strongly ruled out , we nevertheless consider them less likely as potential hosts than @xmath60 , for various stated reasons .",
    "the original xrt error circle contains two other optical sources , designated g1 and s2. our refined xrt error circle , while generally consistent with the original xrt error circle , excludes both of these sources to 90% confidence . nevertheless , as this does not completely eliminate the possibility of association ( especially considering the possibility of ejection )",
    ", we can ask whether or not the proximity of these sources to the xrt position suggests , on probabilistic grounds , that one of these objects is physically associated with the grb . the extended object g1 ( the brightest source and therefore the least likely to be coincident with the error circle by random chance ) has a magnitude of @xmath61 24 ; the integrated sky density for galaxies of equal or greater brightness is about 20 per arcmin@xmath62 .",
    "the probability of a chance association with such an object at this distance or less is @xmath39 0.5  that is , a randomly placed xrt error circle of this size will be as close or closer to such a galaxy about half the time .",
    "the probabilities will be comparable or higher for s2 and several additional , fainter sources we identify in our imaging ( s3 , s4 , and g2 ) .",
    "so while association of the grb with one of these faint sources can not be ruled out , the large size of the xrt error circle simply does not allow this possibility to be strongly tested .",
    "visible on our lris imaging is a nearly edge - on spiral at a distance of 34  northwest of the center of the xrt error circle .",
    "unfortunately this galaxy is strongly blended with a bright galactic star , so an accurate magnitude measurement is difficult , though the blended source has a combined magnitude of 15.56 in the 2mass catalog , slightly fainter than @xmath15 . even making the conservative assumption that @xmath63 , however , the probability of random association with an object of this magnitude at this distance is about a factor of 4 larger than for the association with @xmath15 .",
    "so on probabilistic grounds , if we are to associate grb 060502b with any object in figure 1 , @xmath60 is by far the strongest candidate .",
    "there are two additional objects visible at much greater angular distances from the grb that suggest themselves as possible hosts on account of their unusual brightness . at a distance of 2.0  north of the xrt position",
    "is a bright spiral galaxy , visible in 2mass with a magnitude of @xmath64 . despite this large distance , the probability of random association in this case is @xmath65 , about twice that of association with @xmath60 .",
    "even more suggestively , at a distance of 6.9  is the bright galaxy ugc 11292 , and with a magnitude of @xmath40 = 10.05 @xcite , the probability of such a close random association is only 0.005 ( less than our probability for @xmath60 ) .",
    "still , we tend to disfavor this hypothesis on theoretical grounds : at the measured redshift of this galaxy of @xmath66 @xcite , the physical offset between the galaxy center and the xrt position is 230 kpc .",
    "ugc 11292 is a very massive galaxy ( at @xmath67 it is probably several times as massive as @xmath60 ) .",
    "even with conservative assumptions about the galaxy mass and the position of the progenitor birthplace within it , a large kick ( @xmath68 500 km s@xmath6 ) would be required to eject an object to this distance .",
    "an intriguing alternative possibility might be that the grb was ejected from a much smaller and much less notable host that itself is associated with ugc 11292 .",
    "perhaps the spiral galaxy mentioned above is a member of such an association ; its gravitational potential well would be much more shallow and the offset would be only @xmath6970 kpc .",
    "this is within the range of predicted short - hard grb offsets .",
    "however , although there is some evidence that some short - hard grbs may originate from the local universe @xcite , no specific short grb has yet been associated with any host with @xmath70 . until the local population of short grbs and their hosts ( if real ) has been better characterized or other low - probability chance associations with nearby galaxies are observed , this alternative hypothesis remains extremely speculative , and the _",
    "a posteriori _ probability argument alone is not sufficient to consider ugc 11292 or its hypothetical group a likely host .",
    "the large offset from what we have argued is a plausible host , if true , holds important ramifications for both the sort of viable progenitors and where they are born .",
    "first , the large offset would seem to be at odds with the hypothesis of a degenerate binary origin where systematic kicks are small ( such as in globular clusters [ gcs ] ; @xcite ) . while the expected number density of gcs at 75 kpc is exceedingly small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there certainly could be a gc at @xmath71 in the xrt error circle ( it would appear as faint red point source with magnitude @xmath72 , in principle observable with hst imaging ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath15 could have undergone a major merger leaving behind a progenitor system at the xrt position .",
    "second , if the progenitor was created during what appears to be the last starburst in the putative host , then the time since zero age main sequence would be @xmath4 gyr ( 90% confidence ) . at the inferred offset",
    ", this would imply a minimum systemic kick velocity of @xmath73 km s@xmath6 .",
    "such a kick velocity is comparable to the models for degenerate binaries @xcite and observations of galactic double ns systems @xcite .",
    "the kick could have been significantly larger , implying that the progenitor orbited about the host before the grb event . indeed with the inferred stellar mass @xmath74 of the putative host ,",
    "unless the progenitor was born on the outskirts of the host gravitational potential , the true @xmath75 would have to have been comparable to or greater than dispersion velocity of the host .",
    "if the progenitor remains gravitationally bound to @xmath15 then the systemic orbital velocity of progenitor spends most time near zero velocity , with its initial kinetic energy stored as gravitational potential .",
    "that is , we nominally expect an orbiting progenitor to produce a burst near the maximal distance from its host .",
    "indeed if all the energy is stored as potential , then for shb 060502b , the gravitational potential of the progenitor system is @xmath76 upon birth , the kinetic energy per unit mass imparted to the progenitor must have been : @xmath77 here we have taken the nominal velocity of the kick as the geometric mean of the dispersion velocity ( @xmath78 km s@xmath6 ) and @xmath79 ; that is , we assume @xmath80 km s@xmath6 . that @xmath81 is",
    "even within an order of magnitude of @xmath82 is either a remarkable coincidence or , we suggest , indicative of support on dynamical grounds for the ejection hypothesis .",
    "we end by acknowledging the difficulty of confirming , beyond reasonable doubt , our hypothesis that @xmath15 hosted the birth of the progenitor of shb060205b .",
    "the progenitors of most lsbs , owing to their connection with massive stars , allowed for unambiguous associations with putative hosts  most with probability of chance alignment @xmath83 @xcite . with shb060502b",
    "we have estimated under mildly conservative assumptions ( ie .  without regard to host type )",
    "that the chance of a spurious assignment with @xmath15 is @xmath84 10% .",
    "the @xmath85 argument and the similarity with grb 050509b likely strengthen this particular association . yet with shbs , especially if the majority of progenitors are long - lived high - velocity degenerate mergers , the community must accept that an appreciable fraction of host assignments relative to lsbs will be spurious @xcite .",
    "of course absorption line redshifts of shb afterglows , one of the remaining observational goals of the field , will help to significantly cull the number density of viable hosts on the sky .",
