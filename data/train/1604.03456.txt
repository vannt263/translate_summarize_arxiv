    "the confirmed existence of a milli - parsec - separation supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binary would be an important discovery .",
    "smbh binaries may be present in nature as a consequence of hierarchical mergers of dark matter halos , so the incidence of binary agn provides a potentially important test of galaxy assembly models .",
    "they may be a strong source of gravitational wave emission , and are therefore potentially important probes of general relativity .",
    "mrk  231 is a well - known , nearby ( @xmath2 ) ultra - luminous infrared galaxy that has a seyfert 1 optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "the infrared emission is thought to be a combination of agn and starburst activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recently , attention has been again drawn to this galaxy after the discovery of a powerful , wide - angle , kiloparsec - scale molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "mrk  231 has an unusual spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "while the optical through infrared sed appears typical of quasars , the spectrum is strongly cut off through the near uv , and the continuum is very weak toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "the near - uv - through - infrared sed was studied by @xcite .",
    "we found that the unusual shape was consistent with circumstellar reddening , which is distinguished by a large covering fraction , and large optical depths , approaching one , that produce increased extinction in the blue and uv , with red light scattered back into the line of sight as a secondary effect .",
    "this type of reddening has been observed in type 1a supernovae @xcite , and in gamma - ray burst afterglows @xcite .",
    "some of the theory was developed to treat the general case of the transfer of radiation in galaxies @xcite . in a systematic study of quasar reddening performed by @xcite , while most seds were best fit by a smc reddening curve , a few were better fit by the circumstellar one .",
    "this type of reddening is natural when the geometry is predominately spherical , rather than a screen as usually assumed . @xcite",
    "also interpreted the unusual near - uv - through - optical spectral energy distribution in terms of reddening , although their proposed reddening mechanism was somewhat different .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative explanation of the unusual sed .",
    "they suggest that mrk 231 hosts a milli - parsec binary black hole system , with nearly negligible reddening . the smaller - mass black hole ( @xmath3 )",
    "accretes as a thin disk and dominates the weak uv emission .",
    "the larger - mass black hole ( @xmath4 ) has a low accretion rate and radiates inefficiently as an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "these two black holes are surrounded by a circumbinary disk , which dominates the optical and ir , and the steep rolloff observed toward the uv is the inner edge of the circumbinary disk .",
    "moreover , they suggest that a steep rolloff from the optical toward the uv is a characteristic signature of binary black holes , and thus finding objects with similar spectra provides a method to discover these objects .",
    "a not - to - scale schematic diagram of the model is shown in fig.[fig1 ] ; see also @xcite fig .  1 .        in this paper",
    ", we critique the binary black hole model for mrk  231 presented by @xcite ; in particular , we examine whether the binary black hole model can produce the observed emission lines . in  [ model_review ] , we review the features and assumptions of the @xcite model relevant to the production of the emission lines .  [ data ] motivates our use of near - infrared emission lines , combined with , as diagnostics , and describes the data that we compiled . ",
    "[ sed ] lays out the several spectral energy distributions used for simulations . ",
    "[ cloudy ] reports the results obtained using a set of one - zone _ cloudy _ models .",
    " [ fuv ] describes the analysis of archival _ hst _ stis and foc data indicating evidence for extended emission in the far uv .  [ discussion ] summarizes our results : we find that the binary black hole model can not produce the observed emission lines .",
    "we also show that the binary black hole model can not power the observed mid - infrared continuum ( torus ) emission .",
    "we briefly discuss the potential utility of the infrared emission lines for constraining the intrinsic spectral energy distribution in obscured quasars , as well as a possible reflection origin for the far uv continuum .",
    "a critical feature of the @xcite model is that only the emission from accretion onto the small mass black hole contributes significantly to the photoionizing continuum .",
    "they identify the continuum of the small - mass black hole with the weak far - uv continuum emission @xcite , while the near - uv through infrared emission originates in the circumbinary disk .",
    "thus , their model requires that the photoionizing flux of a small - mass black hole power the line emission of a quasar with a combined mass of @xmath5 orders of magnitude larger . as we will show in  [ mrk231 ] , if this were true , then the observed near - infrared lines would be required to exhibit equivalent widths with respect to the photoionizing continuum ( rather than the observed continuum ) about 100 times larger than normal .",
    "@xcite make assumptions about the spectral energy distribution of the small mass black hole that result in a relatively high fraction of its emission emerging in the far uv .",
    "inferred to be accreting at a significant fraction of eddington , the small black hole s accretion disk would be expected to be bright , and have a high inner - edge temperature .",
    "they assume that the optical - uv continuum is very blue , having the slope of the sum - of - blackbodies accretion disk , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , quasars are generally observed to have a redder optical - uv continuum , closer to @xmath7 ; this is one of the unexplained mysteries of accretion disks , along with the lack of polarization and clear evidence for lyman edges @xcite .",
    "finally , they assume that the x - ray flux is negligible .",
    "this is inconsistent with observations , as we show in  [ sed ] .",
    "these factors combine to make their assumed accretion disk emit a maximally high fraction of its continuum in photoionizing photons .",
    "we explore the effect of their optimized spectral energy distribution the predicted line emission in  [ cloudy ] , along with the predicted emission using more typical seds , and show that none of them can produce the observed flux and ratios of the near - infrared helium and hydrogen broad lines .",
    "@xcite address the question of line emission in their  6 .",
    "they make a simple nebular approximation and compute the expected number of h@xmath8 photons resulting from recombination of hydrogen in a gas illuminated by their assumed spectral energy distribution .",
    "they predict that sufficient h@xmath8 emission would be produced if the global covering fraction is @xmath9 .",
    "however , this analysis is insufficient , because hydrogen lines are produced in the partially - ionized zone in quasars , and the line ratios and fluxes are observed to be different from those predicted using the simple nebular approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , quasars produce other emission lines besides the balmer lines , and it is not obvious that those would be produced with sufficient strength to match observations . we perform a more realistic and complete line analysis in  [ cloudy ] .",
    "our goal in this paper was to determine whether the line emission observed in mrk 231 is consistent with the binary hypothesis put forth by @xcite , not to provide a full model of the emission lines .",
    "therefore we considered just a few lines that provide sufficient diagnostic power .",
    "the near infrared spectrum is relatively free of the effects of reddening , regardless of the interpretation of the continuum .",
    "our spectrum was obtained using the spex instrument on the irtf , and the details of the observation are found in @xcite .",
    "we use * @xmath10 , a line that arises from recombination of once - ionized helium . the energy required to create",
    "he@xmath11 is 24  ev , and therefore * probes the part of the broad - line region emission . being a recombination line , it is principally a diagnostic of the flux of the ionizing continuum on the broad - line - region gas .",
    "for example , for a semi - infinite slab , the flux of this line is monotonic with the helium - continuum photoionizing flux .",
    "we also used paschen @xmath0 at 12818 and paschen @xmath8 at 18751 .",
    "paschen @xmath0 occurs in close proximity to the line in the spectrum , so reddening does not affect their line ratios significantly . the ratio of paschen @xmath8 to paschen @xmath0 can be influenced by reddening , but much less than , for example , the balmer lines , since reddening curves flatten toward the near infrared .",
    "the paschen lines are recombination lines of hydrogen , and their fluxes and ratios are influenced strongly by the physical conditions of the line - emitting gas .",
    "although these lines are produced throughout the ionized gas slab , a significant amount is produced beyond the hydrogen ionization front , in the partially - ionized zone .",
    "our simulations (  [ cloudy ] ) show that a significant column of partially - ionized gas is required for these lines to be observable against the bright quasar continuum . in the partially - ionized zone",
    ", the opacity to lyman lines can be very large , and hydrogen line ratios are dramatically different from those predicted in the simple nebular approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , absorbed and thermalized ly@xmath8 can create a significant population of hydrogen in @xmath12 , which can then suffer photoionization by photons with wavelengths shorter than 3646 .",
    "x - ray photoionization is also important . in addition , while hydrogen in @xmath13 can not be collisionally excited because the difference in energy between @xmath13 and @xmath12 is too large , hydrogen in @xmath12 can experience collisional excitation , and this process will contribute to the balmer and paschen lines .",
    "the presence of a population of hydrogen in @xmath12 means that balmer lines will also experience significant optical depths , reducing the radiative de - excitation and cooling .",
    "additional processes such as charge exchange and collisional de - excitation may also contribute .",
    "turbulence or differential velocities will change the line optical depth , further altering the line ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the recombination line fluxes and ratios are best estimated using a photoionization code such as _ cloudy _ , which accounts for all of these processes .",
    "we use @xmath14 to probe the uv where reddening is important .",
    "is a collisionally - excited line that is produced in the portion of the broad - line region .",
    "it is generally one of the strongest lines present in quasar spectra , a consequence of the relatively high abundance of carbon , and its easy excitability , as c@xmath15 has only one valence electron .    in this paper",
    ", we use as our diagnostics the strength of the * line ( either the equivalent width of the line , or the predicted flux , depending on the situation ; see below ) , and the line flux ratios * /p@xmath0 , p@xmath8/p@xmath0 , and * /.",
    "thus , we are leaving out a great deal of physics known to be relevant to the broad line region .",
    "for example , we do not take into account the fact that the blr is not likely to be characterized by a single set of physical parameters ( ionization parameter , density , column density ) but rather to be a superposition of line emission from gas characterized by a range of parameters .",
    "this latter case is addressed by the locally optimally emitting clouds ( loc ) models @xcite , and loc models for some of the lines considered in this paper have been investigated by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a one - zone photoionization model , principally because it is sufficient to prove our point , as the effect that we see is very apparent , even without photoionization analysis , as described in ",
    "[ mrk231 ] .",
    "it is also known that various emission lines can have different shapes that reflect an origin in kinematically different gases .",
    "for example , in some relatively rare cases , the high - ionization lines such as can be broad and blueshifted , while intermediate- and low - ionization lines are narrow and symmetric about the rest wavelength ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we do not address this in our analysis either , again because the result we find is not subtle , and because the observed line profiles do nt warrant this consideration .",
    "finally , emission lines are known to respond to the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "if the sed is hard , i.e. , the x - ray band is strong relative to the uv , then high - ionization lines are observed to be strong ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the sed is soft , then the high - ionization lines are observed to be weak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we address this effect by considering several spectral energy distributions that to first approximation span the range of shapes observed in agn and quasars .",
    "the * , p@xmath0 , and p@xmath8 lines were modeled in @xcite , and we take those measurements from that analysis .",
    "_ hst _ has observed the region twice , and both observations are available in the archive .",
    "the first observation was taken in 1996 with fos and is shown in @xcite .",
    "the second one was taken in 2014 using cos .",
    "they are consistent with one another , although the cos spectrum has much better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we measure the flux in the line in the cos spectrum by fitting it with two gaussians .",
    "analysis of the near - infrared line equivalent widths shows us , in a simple qualitative way , why the @xcite model is untenable .",
    "it is known that the properties of the broad line emission among agn and quasars ( e.g. , the lines observed , their equivalent widths , and their ratios ) are roughly the same over a factor of @xmath16 in inferred black hole masses and luminosities .",
    "some variation does occur , for example , the baldwin effect @xcite , but this accounts for a variation of less than one order of magnitude in equivalent width over four orders of magnitude in luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "the constancy of the line equivalent widths means that photoionizing flux scales with the continuum under the emission lines .",
    "thus , luminous quasars have luminous blr emission , and less luminous agn have less luminous blr emission .",
    "so it is not reasonable to expect that a small black hole will be able to power the line emission of a luminous quasar .",
    "this idea is investigated qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows a variation of @xcite figure 5 that includes analysis of the emission lines .",
    "we first overlaid the intrinsic continuum , inferred in @xcite , with an optical - ir composite spectrum created by joining the sdss composite @xcite to the sdss / irtf composite @xcite at around 4000 .",
    "the merged composite provides infrared coverage , and avoids the well - known long - wavelength flattening present in the sdss quasar composite due to host galaxy contributions of lower - luminosity quasars that dominate the sdss composite on the red end of the visible band .",
    "the match is good except at very long wavelengths where an additional hot blackbody component is present @xcite .",
    "next , we applied the @xcite reddening curve , using the parameters that we inferred in @xcite , to the quasar composite spectrum .",
    "overlaid is the observed mrk  231 spectrum .",
    "the overall agreement is very good through the optical and near uv where the line emission is typical of quasars .",
    "mrk  231 has somewhat stronger emission , and somewhat weaker balmer emission , but the difference is within the range observed among agn and quasars .",
    "the reddened composite spectrum also provides a reasonable match to the near - uv continuum , against which the and broad absorption lines expected in this felobal can be seen .",
    "we discuss the far - uv in  [ fuv ] .",
    "the @xcite model posits that the continuum from the normally - accreting small black hole is swamped by the circumbinary disk emission through the optical and infrared , but it becomes visible in the uv , shortward of the rolloff caused by the inner edge of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the gray dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the @xcite continuum scaled to match the near - uv spectrum ; this represents the putative continuum of the small black hole . in the region of the infrared lines of interest , around 1 micron",
    ", this continuum is a factor of @xmath17 below the observed mrk 231 continuum . _ thus , if the small black hole is producing all of the photoionizing photons in the system , then the infrared line equivalent widths would have to be a factor of @xmath17 stronger than typical with respect to the small black hole continuum in order to show the observed equivalent widths with respect to the observed continuum .",
    "_ this does not seem plausible , as such huge equivalent widths have never been seen .",
    "indeed , as we will show in ",
    "[ yan_cloudy ] , the smaller black hole continuum lacks sufficient power to produce the observed infrared line emission .",
    "we used the inferred luminosities to estimate the radius of the broad line region . interpolating the flux density at 5100 from the @xcite intrinsic continuum and the @xcite photoionizing continuum ( orange and gray lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and using the `` clean '' parameters for the radius / luminosity relationship from @xcite , the h@xmath0 emitting blr is estimated to be located 99 and 6.5 light days from the central engine for the reddened and the binary black hole interpretations , respectively .",
    "the first value seems typical for a quasar , while the second value is small among reverberation - mapped agn @xcite .",
    "relatively rapid variability of h@xmath0 would be predicted ; that has never been reported ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , the inner edge of the circumbinary disk is estimated by @xcite to be 4.2 light days from the center .",
    "so , in the @xcite scenario , the blr would have to be located on top of the circumbinary disk , close to its inner edge , and , as discussed above , would have to emit more than 100 times the normal flux of a typical broad - line region .      in order to interpret the line emission from mrk  231 , we compiled the characteristic properties of a small sample of seyfert galaxies and quasars for comparison .",
    "infrared spectra of nearby seyfert galaxies and quasars were presented by @xcite , and we took * , p@xmath0 , and p@xmath8 ( when available ) line fluxes from this reference .",
    "we excluded mrk  590 because it has turned into a seyfert 2 @xcite .",
    "we excluded ngc  3227 as it is highly reddened @xcite .",
    "our sample included 15 objects with measurements of these three lines and from the literature ( see below ) , and three more objects with measurements of * , p@xmath0 , and only . among these 18 objects ,",
    "14 have black hole masses .",
    "the range of log black hole masses represented , in units of solar mass , is 6.88 to 8.84 , with a mean of 7.66 and standard deviation of 0.54 .",
    "the range therefore is a bit higher than the log black hole mass inferred for the small mass black hole ( 6.65 [ solar masses ] ) .",
    "however , we found that two objects with small log black hole masses , ngc 4051 ( 6.130 ) and ngc 4748 ( 6.41 ) , have infrared line properties @xcite consistent with the range of our comparison sample .",
    "@xcite attempted to deconvolve the emission lines in terms of a broad line and a narrow line .",
    "this is an uncertain procedure unless there is a break in slope between the broad and narrow line ( i.e. , as in a seyfert 1.5 or 1.8 ) ; in general , it is difficult to determine how much of the line should be ascribed to the narrow line region , especially when the line is cuspy . to avoid this uncertainty",
    ", we used the total line flux , i.e. , the sum of the narrow and broad line fluxes in @xcite table 5 .",
    "we note that the narrow line flux is generally much smaller than the broad line flux ( the median ratio of narrow to broad line flux is about 9% ) , so this approximation does not increase the uncertainty significantly .",
    "moreover , we used the line ratios of the comparison sample simply as an indication of the range of ratios observed in nature , so high precision is not required .",
    "reddening can alter the line ratios , but to different degrees depending on the ratio . reddening influences the * /p@xmath0 ratio minimally for typical objects ; for example , a modest @xmath18 and an smc reddening curve results in a decrease in this ratio by about 2.3% .",
    "the difference is larger for a heavily - reddened object like mrk  231 , where the @xcite reddening curve with the parameters measured by @xcite yield a decrease in the ratio of 8.3% .",
    "reddening is somewhat more important for the p@xmath8/p@xmath0 , where @xmath18 increases the ratio by 3.4% for smc , and 19% for the reddening measured in @xcite .",
    "reddening is much more important for the * / ratio , which increases by 290% for @xmath18 , i.e. , a factor of 126 times larger effect than for the * /p@xmath0 ratio .",
    "so , we think that much of the origin of the large range of * /p@xmath0 ratios is intrinsic , rather than a consequence of reddening , because the dispersion , parameterized by the standard deviation divided by the mean , is similar for the * /p@xmath0 ratio ( 0.37 ) and the / ratio ( 0.81 ) .",
    "if reddening were dominating the range of observed * /p@xmath0 ratios , then a much larger dispersion would be expected for the / ratio .",
    "we also included data from the intrinsically x - ray weak quasar phl 1811 @xcite .",
    "@xcite draw comparisons with this object , positing that mrk  231 has some similarities with phl  1811 analogs and weak - lined quasars .",
    "we analyzed a spectrum from our observations made using irtf spex on 2008 august 22 , 23 , and 24 .",
    "we fit the continuum with a polynomial , and the emission lines with lorentzian profiles in the * / p@xmath0 region , requiring that the paschen lines ( i.e. , the isolated p@xmath0 line and the blended p@xmath19 line ) have the same width and a separation based on rest wavelengths . several lines were modeled with gaussians .",
    "we model the self - absorption on the * emission line using a gaussian optical depth profile .",
    "p@xmath8 is relatively isolated and was well modeled with a lorentzian profile .",
    "we obtained measurements from the literature .",
    "we dropped iras  1750@xmath20508 , h1934@xmath21063 , and h  2106@xmath21099 from the sample because they had had no uv spectroscopic observations .",
    "we extracted as many measurements as possible from @xcite , @xcite , and/or @xcite because they presented a uniform analysis of large sets of _ hst _ spectra .",
    "other sources of _ hst _ measurements included @xcite for pds  456 , @xcite for 3c  273 and h1821@xmath20643 , @xcite for ngc  7469 , and @xcite for phl  1811 .",
    "there were only _ iue _ measurements available for mrk  79 , pg  0844@xmath20349 , mrk  110 and ngc  4593 , compiled in @xcite .",
    "these were used with caution because comparison of values from the subset of objects that also had observations using _ hst _ showed that the @xcite measurements were consistently a factor of @xmath22 lower .",
    "we suspected that the flux - units footnote on @xcite table 1 is too low by a factor of 10 , and we therefore multiplied their values by 10 .",
    "the uv spectroscopic observations were not made simultaneously with the infrared spectroscopic observations , so relative variability is a concern .",
    "we estimated the importance of this effect by compiling measurements from multiple _ hst _ observations when available : these are shown by blue and green points in fig .",
    "examination of this figure shows that the * / ratio varies more across the sample than it does for any single object ( quantified below ) , and therefore relative variability is not important .",
    "again , our intention was to estimate the range of the * / ratio observed in nature , and high precision was not necessary .",
    "we derived the range of line properties observed in the comparison sample .",
    "these ranges were used to compare with those from mrk  231 , and to constrain the simulations discussed in  [ cloudy ] .",

    "the * /p@xmath0 ratio is shown in the top left panel .",
    "this ratio lies between 0.37 and 2.52 ( a range of a factor of @xmath23 ) , with mean and standard deviation of @xmath24 . for mrk  231 ,",
    "we show the observed ratio , and the ratio after correcting for the reddening inferred in @xcite .",
    "neither mrk  231 nor phl  1811 have exceptional values of this ratio .",
    "to constrain the simulations , we use an upper limit of 2.5 ( as observed ) but extend the lower limit to 0.1 in order to roughly compensate for possible contribution of * emission from an outflowing component that may not be present in p@xmath0 .",

    "we consider values between 0.9 and 2.0 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , in the low - density , low - optical - depth limit ( case a ) , and the large - optical - depth limit whereby every lyman - line photon is scattered many times ( case b ) , p@xmath8/p@xmath0 ratios of 2.33 and 2.28 are predicted , respectively .",
    "our ratios are significantly lower than that , suggesting high optical depths in the broad line region .",
    "the range of observed * / ratios is large in the comparison sample ( 0.025 to 0.37 , a factor of @xmath26 ) , with a mean of 0.11 and a standard deviation of 0.089 .",
    "phl  1811 has a rather large ratio of @xmath27 .",

    "this indicates that the spatial profile for phl  1811 is slightly broader than the stis line spread function .",
    "part of the difference could be due to the fact that at shorter wavelengths the stis line spread function is broader with more prominent wings .",
    "the remaining difference is taken to represent the residual systematic uncertainty in the rectification of the 2d images .",
    "the mrk 231 profile differs from both the stis line spread function and the phl 1811 profile .",
    "while the pixel location of the 0.75 cumulative histogram level coincides with that of the stis line spread function and the phl  1811 , the pixel locations of the 0.5 and especially the 0.25 levels are offset .",
    "this indicates that the spatial profile of mrk  231 is quite a bit broader than that expected from a point source , especially at short wavelengths , as well as being asymmetric .",

    "this is precisely the behavior expected if the far - uv continuum is extended and fills in the bottoms of saturated troughs .",

    "as the stis mama is a photon counting detector , we assume that the uncertainty on these counts profiles is poisson .    if the trough is filled in by the far uv continuum , the difference between the total continuum and the trough continuum profiles , referred to as the net continuum profile , can be assumed to characterize the profile of the nuv point source , in particular , its spatial location .",
    "we fit this profile using ciao sherpa with a template model created from the stis g230l line spread function a range of pixel offsets . to determine the pixel location of the nucleus .",

    "[ fig6 ] shows the trough profile subject to such a fit .",
    "a significant wing is observed on the left side of the profile , invalidating the assumption that mrk  231 fuv emission is consistent with the nuclear point source , and indicating the presence of extended emission .    in order to quantify the extent of the extended emission",
    ", we make the simple assumption that the mrk  231 fuv profile consists of the nuclear emission plus another , offset component .",
    "we fit the trough profile with the net profile model component , and a second offset profile .",
    "the result is shown in the lowest right panel of fig .",
    "this model provides a good fit to the wing on the left side of the profile .",
    "the offset component accounts for 20% of the total flux , and the separation is @xmath100 pixels , corresponding to @xmath101 arcseconds . at the distance of mrk  231 , 1 arcsecond corresponds to 863 parsecs @xcite ,",

    "for example , there can be geometrical distortion .",
    "usually well calibrated using the reseau marks in the larger format ( 512@xmath106512 ) observations , there may not be sufficient information for that calibration in the smaller formats ; the mrk  231 observation was made in the 128@xmath106128 format .",
    "moreover , there is variation in the distortion during the detector warmup period , and while no data is taken during the initial warmup period , residual variation on the order of 0.25% in the plate scale can be present during the next two hours .",
    "according to the timeline , this was the second observation in the sequence .",
    "we ca nt compare with the polarimetry observations , as the polarimetry imaging elements add their own psf . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear that geometric distortion would be an important effect on the small scales that we are interested in .",
    "finally , there are also known to be small changes in telescope focus due to `` breathing '' .",
    "we analyzed the mrk 231 observation and the psf observation in parallel using the cxc ciao _ sherpa _ package .",
    "we first fit the two images with co - axial two - dimensional gaussian profiles plus a background .",
    "we found that in each case , four gaussians were sufficient to empirically describe the psf .",
    "the radial profiles from these fits are shown in fig .",
    "the rather broad base corresponds to the particularly extended wings known to characterize this filter .",
    "the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the empirically - fit radial profiles for mrk  231 and the psf observation , with the constant background subtracted , normalized , and overlaid on the mrk  231 radial profile .",
    "mrk  231 shows significant excess on the 14 pixel scale .",
    "sherpa offers the capability of fitting the image with a 2-dimensional model after convolving with a psf image .",
    "we fit the mrk  231 observation with a 2-d gaussian and a constant , using the background - subtracted psf observation image as the psf .",
    "if the mrk  231 image were consistent with the detector psf , the width of the gaussian would be equal to zero .",
    "instead , we find a best - fit value of @xmath107 pixels , corresponding to @xmath108 arcsecond , or 42  pc .",
    "the fit is good , and no distinguishable improvement in fit is obtained by adding another gaussian .",
    "the radial profile of the gaussian model convolved with the psf is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "the foc psf is known to not be azimuthally symmetric ; moreover the psf observation places the psf star near a reseau mark .",
    "so we also fit the mrk  231 image using a psf developed from the gaussian - fit model of the psf image .",
    "the results were essentially the same ; the width of a single 2-d gaussian was @xmath109 pixels , corresponding to @xmath110 arcsecond , or 41  pc .    beyond the extended emission ,",
    "the foc image provided no exceptional indication of structure .",
    "for example , a 2-d elliptical model does not provide notable improvement in fit .",
    "but the signal - to - noise ratio of this image is low .",
    "the peak pixel contained 93 photons , and we estimate only @xmath111 source photons for the image within a radius of 5 pixels , for an average of 20 photons per pixel .",
    "the stis spatial analysis suggested that if the offset component were modeled as a point source , its intensity would be 20% of the main component .",
    "simulated images show that such an offset point source might be just detectable in an image with these statistics .",
    "but the emission might be truly extended , in which case an asymmetry , lying in the wings of the nuclear psf , would be very difficult to detect in an image with these statistics .",
    "we used observed emission lines from mrk  231 and a comparison sample to investigate the binary - black hole model proposed by @xcite , and to compare it with the circumstellar absorption model proposed by @xcite .",
    "we used infrared lines , which are subject to minimal reddening regardless of the model .",
    "the * @xmath112 line yielded information about the ionization parameter , while the p@xmath0 line at 12818 and the p@xmath8 line at 18751 yielded information about the density ( due to thermalization at high density ) and column density of the emitting gas .",
    "@xmath113 was used to probe the ultraviolet , to see whether that emission line is intrinsically weak and minimally absorbed , as proposed by @xcite , or dramatically absorbed , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model assumed that the broad line region emission in mrk  231 is powered by the photoionizing continuum produced by thin - disk accretion onto the smaller of the two black holes .",
    "thus , in order to produce emission lines in the near infrared that are seen to have typical equivalent widths with respect to the observed continuum the equivalent widths with respect small - black - hole - mass continuum would have to be huge , approximately 100 times larger than normal , since the photoionizing continuum extrapolated into the infrared is @xmath114 times weaker than the observed continuum (  [ mrk231 ] ) .",
    "this seems quite implausible , even without quantitative analysis , and thus provides the first piece of evidence that the @xcite model is untenable .    using the photonionization code",
    "_ cloudy _ , we first established that we were able to produce the observed * equivalent widths , and * /p@xmath0 , p@xmath8/p@xmath0 , and * / ratios of a comparison sample of objects using two spectral energy distributions that roughly bracket the properties of observed agn and quasar continua .",
    "we next investigated spectral energy distributions similar to those proposed by @xcite , i.e. , sum - of - blackbodies accretion disks with small inner radii ( @xmath77 and schwartzschild ) that were normalized to the observed far - uv continuum .",
    "we required the x - ray portion of the spectrum to go through the observed spectrum presented by @xcite , a departure from @xcite , who neglected the x - ray emission .",
    "mrk  231 has a rather typical * /p@xmath0 ratio , so we sought simulations that produced both a typical range of * /p@xmath0 ratios and the observed intensity of the * emission line . there were none , even if the broad line region is assumed ( unrealistically ) to fully cover the continuum emitting source .",
    "this provided the second piece of evidence that @xcite model is untenable .",
    "our _ cloudy _ models showed that the * / ratio is sensitive to the sed shape , being lower for harder ( x - ray bright ) seds and higher for softer ( x - ray weak ) seds , with the maximum values produced by the sed from the intrinsically x - ray weak quasar phl  1811 .",
    "however , mrk  231 s * / ratio was @xmath17 times higher than the one from phl  1811 .",
    "we conclude that we do not see the direct emission in mrk  231 .",
    "the origin of the emission that we do observe is not known ; we speculate it may be due to scattering (  [ spec ] ) , or it may be produced in the bal outflow @xcite .",
    "analysis of the 2-d image from archival _ hst _ stis observation shows that the spatial profile of the far - uv continuum is asymmetrically extended .",
    "moreover , the spatial profile in the and low - excitation troughs is similarly extended , suggesting that these absorption lines are saturated and the troughs are filled in by the far - uv continuum .",
    "evidence for extended emission in the far - uv was also found in an archival _ hst _ foc image .",
    "the scale of the offset emission in both cases was @xmath115 .",
    "the focus of this paper is a critique of the @xcite model , and we do not purport to provide a full model of the broad line region .",
    "nevertheless , we have learned a few interesting things about the infrared lines and _ cloudy _",
    "models for them .",
    "the observed p@xmath8/p@xmath0 line ratios in the comparison sample are rather low , with a range between 0.94 and 1.74 and a mean of 1.2 .",
    "they are much lower than the case a ( case b ) values of 2.33 ( 2.28 ) in the low density limit @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the hydrogen - line emission regions are very optically thick and thermalization is important .",
    "this is not unexpected , as it has been known for many years that the ly@xmath8/h@xmath0 is observed to be typically around 10 , rather than 23 or 34 ( the low and high density case b limits ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was surprising , however , to see how thermalization influences line ratios at different densities to produce a strongly localized density range for the simple one - zone model .",
    "while arguably not directly applicable to agn spectra , it may be useful to consider this behavior for complete models of the broad line region .",
    "also intriguing is the sensitivity of the * /p@xmath0 ratio to the sed . on the face of it ,",
    "this result is not surprising , given that the * line responds to the strength of the helium continuum , while the p@xmath0 depends the ionizing flux and column density of the gas .",
    "this suggests that the near - infrared broad line ratios could be used to infer the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of obscured quasars .",
    "but this result must be viewed with extreme caution . in this paper",
    ", we used a one - zone model for simplicity , and it is not clear that the same effect would be present in a extended - blr model .",
    "indeed , it is not clear that these lines can be trivially modeled using an extended - blr model .",
    "@xcite investigated an loc model for the hydrogen lines , and found themselves forced into a small region of photoionization parameter space .",
    "this could be because the standard loc , which was historically proposed to explain the high - ionization uv lines @xcite , is simply more appropriate for that regime , and less appropriate for the low - ionization lines considered here .",
    "in fact , the loc does nt always work well for high - ionization lines @xcite .",
    "in addition , the standard loc model has a substantial fraction of optically thin clouds , while we have shown that high optical depths are needed to produce sufficient line emission and correct line ratios .",
    "moreover , it is not clear that the sed that illuminates low - ionization - line emitting gas is the same as the continuum we see ; it may have been `` filtered '' by gas producing the high - ionization lines @xcite .",
    "alternative models using radiation pressure confinement may work better for these lines @xcite . while this is an interesting and potentially important problem given the dearth of sed diagnostics the infrared , it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "while we have demonstrated that the strength of the near - ir broad - line emission can not be accounted for by the uv - to - optical sed as observed , implying the presence of an intrinsically much more luminous ionizing continuum , there is an additional argument to be made based on considerations of the mid - infrared power of mrk  231 that is independent of the physics of the broad - line region .",
    "the thermal near- and mid - infrared ( @xmath116@xmath117  @xmath118 m ) emission of quasars is attributed to dust heated by absorption of optical - through - x - ray emission from the central engine .",
    "the tight , linear correlation between unobscured optical ( 0.11@xmath118 m ) and infrared ( 1100 @xmath118 m ) quasar luminosities seen in radio - quiet quasars supports this interpretation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the infrared luminosity is therefore arguably a more robust indicator of bolometric luminosity than the optical - uv as observed because the infrared is much less susceptible to dust extinction . @xcite",
    "recommended the 3@xmath118 m luminosity in particular as a good single value for estimating quasar bolometric luminosities because the hottest dust is certainly powered by the agn with no starburst contamination .",
    "the weak pah emission seen in the @xmath119-band and mid - infrared spectra of mrk  231 supports the claim that this region of the spectrum is dominated by the quasar @xcite . from the @xmath119-band spectrum of mrk  231 presented in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath120 is @xmath121  erg  s@xmath80 .",
    "using the 3-to - ir bolometric correction of @xmath122 @xcite gives @xmath123  erg  s@xmath80 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude _",
    "greater than _ the 0.1 - 1@xmath118 m luminosity of the observed continuum ( gray dashed + green dashed continua ) shown in figure  2 : @xmath124  erg  s@xmath80 .",
    "correcting for smc extinction with @xmath18 following @xcite brings @xmath125 up to @xmath126  erg  s@xmath80 , still well below the @xmath127 that is supposedly powered by this continuum .",
    "however , the extinction - corrected 0.11.0@xmath118 m continuum ( orange dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) gives @xmath128  erg  s@xmath80 , in line with the expectations from the ir power ( from figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the @xcite model also does not adequately explain the near - uv - to - optical polarization in mrk  231 , which is significant and strongly rising to the blue through @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "this kind of polarization signature is commonly seen in reddened objects .",
    "@xcite analyzed the similarly - polarized infrared - luminous quasar iras  13349 + 2438 .",
    "they showed that electron scattering , which produces a wavelength - independent polarization , combined with a reddened continuum produces a blue - polarized spectrum .",
    "that is , the intrinsic polarization is constant , but appears to increase toward the blue due to dilution by the unpolarized , reddened , direct continuum in the red .",
    "alternatively , scattering by small dust grains produces polarization increasing toward the blue ( rayleigh scattering ) . a similar polarization signature is seen among many type 1 reddened objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mrk  231 is a low - ionization broad absorption line quasar , and these objects are known to be significantly polarized ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and reddened ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , mrk  231 shows evidence for x - ray absorption @xcite , and polarized type 1 objects are more likely to suffer x - ray absorption than unpolarized ones @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that mrk  231 has strong optical emission , and therefore might be expected to have comparably strong uv emission , which is not seen .",
    "the @xcite circumstellar absorption model explains this lack of strong uv naturally via reddening ; both the continuum and the line emission are attenuated in the near uv ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "since @xcite inferred that reddening is minimal , they proposed another explanation for the weak uv emission , that since mrk  231 is a known absorption line quasar ( felobal , * ? ? ? * ) , the emission is absorbed exactly by the absorption in the bal outflow .",
    "this idea is untenable for several reasons .",
    "first , the velocity offset of the low - ionization line absorption in mrk  231 is known to be between about @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( e.g. , figure 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite required a much broader velocity width to produce their exact subtraction , between @xmath132 and @xmath133 .    more importantly , however , the recent _ hst _ stis observation ( which appears very similar to the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , albeit with the significant advantage of better signal - to - noise ratio and resolution ) shows that mrk 231 s near - uv absorption is strong , with saturated low - excitation from levels between 0 and 0.12 ev ( near 2600 and 2400 a ) , while absorption from higher excitation levels between 0.98 and 1.1 ev ( near 2750 ) is present but weaker @xcite .",
    "some of the @xcite solutions are therefore ruled out based on the presence of the higher excitation , which requires a higher density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some of the optimized models discussed in  8 of @xcite produce sufficient higher excitation , in particular , the density step - function models with an illuminated - face density @xmath134 $ ] , constant pressure in the region , and increasing by a factor of 25 in the partially ionized zone . as seen in fig .",
    "12 in @xcite , the inferred location of these optimized models is 40 parsecs , somewhat interior to the nuclear starburst , but interestingly consistent with the extended emission discussed in   [ fuv ] .",
    "whether or not these models fit the new stis data in detail is beyond the scope of the current paper .      in  [ fuv ] , we describe analysis of archival stis and foc data that indicates the presence of extended far uv continuum emission .",
    "the most convincing evidence comes from the discovery that the spatial profile is broader and offset in the broad absorption troughs ( e.g. , ) compared with the near - uv continuum .",
    "the foc image suffers from poor signal - to - noise ratio and a complicated psf , but is intriguing as the size scale derived ( @xmath1 parsecs ) is basically the same as that derived from the stis spatial profile analysis @xmath135 parsecs , and a revised estimate of the location of the absorber .",
    "one of the mysterious properties of the far uv spectrum is the lack of broad absorption lines , despite the presence of strong optical , near - uv , and infrared absorption lines .",
    "this can not be a consequence of a special combination of photoionization gas parameters .",
    "the presence of absorption means that the column density of the absorber extends beyond the hydrogen ionization front ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of strong * absorption sets a lower limit on the ionization parameter @xcite .",
    "strong absorption from many species would be expected , including , for example , .",
    "@xcite explain the lack of far uv absorption lines via a special geometry ( specifically , * ? ? ?",
    "8) . they postulate a dusty outflow that covers the optical and near uv emission region , producing absorption lines on that continuum .",
    "it is opaque to the far uv , but 10% reaches the viewer unobscured .",
    "the important point , for this discussion , is that the fuv continuum is thought to be very compact , emitted by the funnel of a slim disk , and it would be expected to be unresolved .",
    "the presence of extended emission casts some doubt upon this explanation .",
    "our analysis shows that a significant amount of fuv continuum is not coincident with the central engine emitting the near - uv and optical continuum .",
    "it is possible that all of the far - uv continuum emerging from the central engine is attenuated by the significant reddening that is the origin of the rolloff in the optical and uv .",
    "then , the observed far - uv continuum comes from somewhere near the central engine , but not from the central engine , and that is why there are no far - uv broad absorption lines .",
    "uv variability is commonly observed in agn and quasars , and it can be used to identify them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an origin of the far uv continuum in extended emission in mrk  231 predicts that the continuum should not be variable .",
    "@xcite report no significant fuv variability between two cos observations separated by 3 years .",
    "the lack of variability provides further support for dominance of an extended emission component for the far uv continuum",
    ".    the offset emission may be somewhat similar to an optical continuum peak or `` hot spot '' in the inner narrow - line region of the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068 .",
    "long - slit stis spectroscopy revealed a continuum shape indistinguishable from seyfert 1 galaxies , as well as broad components of emission lines such as .",
    "@xcite conclude that this component is reflected emission from the central engine .",
    "the hot spot lies 30 pc from the estimated position of the central engine in ngc  1068 @xcite , intriguingly close to the estimates of the location of the extended emission in mrk  231 .",
    "an important difference , from a data analysis point of view , is that ngc  1068 is much nearer than mrk  231 ; e.g. , an arcsecond corresponds to 60 parsecs in ngc  1068 versus 867 parsecs in mrk 231 .",
    "we suggest that a scattering /reflection scenario may have been too hastily dismissed by @xcite .",
    "the continuum flux near 2000 is found to be about 165 times weaker than the intrinsic continuum inferred by @xcite , i.e. , 0.6% of the intrinsic flux .",
    "such a level of scattering is not implausible ; e.g. , a median scattering efficiency of 2.3% is found in a sample of obscured quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * although the scattering regions in those galaxies are very large ) .",
    "@xcite dismiss scattering due to the low level of polarization in the uv , as observed by @xcite , but we note that while the polarization in the uv is lower than it is in the near - uv , it is not zero .",
    "moreover , it shows a position angle rotation compared with the strong near - uv polarization , which suggests a different origin . also , we note that the degree of polarization that is observed depends on the asymmetry of the scatterer . for example , the hot spot in ngc  1068 shows a high degree of polarization , but the geometry in that case ( a relatively small , single reflector well resolved from the hidden nucleus ) is nearly ideal for producing high polarization .",
    "if the scatterer in mrk  231 has a large solid angle to the nucleus , high polarization is not expected .",
    "in addition , the optical polarization in mrk  231 has been observed to be variable @xcite , and the _ hst _ uv polarization observation was performed more than 20 years ago .",
    "finally , an intriguing possibility is that the far uv continuum may be nuclear continuum reflected from the wind on the far side of the nucleus .",
    "this is suggested by the confluence of distance estimates : 36 - 40 parsecs for the extended emission (   [ fuv ] ) , and @xmath1 parsecs as a revised approximate distance to the broad absorption line gas (   [ strategic ] ) .",
