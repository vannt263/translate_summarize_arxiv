    "this paper is a summary of numerous talks i gave last year . my goal was to understand homology theory related to distributivity ( and motivated by knot theory ) , but along the way i discovered various elementary structures , probably new , or at least not studied before .",

    "this , in addition to being a basis for my multi - term distributive homology , may be of interest to people working on universal algebras .    because i hope for a broad audience i do not assume any specific knowledge of homological algebra or algebraic topology and will survey the basic concepts like chain complex chain homotopy and abstract simplicial complex in sections 3 and 4 . in the fifth section",
    "i recall two classical approaches to homology of a semigroup : group homology and hochschild homology . in the sixth section",
    "we build a one - term homology of distributive structures and recall the definition of the rack homology of fenn , rourke , and sanderson @xcite . in further sections we deepen our study of distributive homology , define multi - term distributive homology and show a few examples of computations . in the tenth section we relate distributivity to the third reidemeister move ( or braid relation ) and discuss motivation coming from knot theory . in a concluding remark",
    "we speculate on relations with the yang - baxter operator and a potential path to khovanov homology .",

    "associativity follows from the fact that adjoint maps @xmath12 compose in an associative way , @xmath13 ; we can write directly : @xmath14 .",
    "the submonoid of @xmath6 of all invertible elements in @xmath6 is a group denoted by @xmath15 . if @xmath16 then @xmath17 is usually denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the composition of operations in the monoid @xmath6 may be thought as taking first the diagonal coproduct @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) and applying the result on @xmath21 ; berfriend fauser suggested after my march talk in san antonio to try other comultiplications ( he did some unpublished work on it ) .",

    "if a quandle @xmath2 satisfies @xmath29 ( i.e. @xmath30 ) then it is called _ kei _ or an involutive quandle .",

    "the premiere example given by takasaki was to take an abelian group and define @xmath33 .",

    "@xmath933 , which is exactly @xmath934 .",
    "thus @xmath930 and @xmath935 are homologous in @xmath936 and @xmath937 .",
    "we showed that if @xmath911 is any quandle and we choose a quandle coloring of @xmath900 , then @xmath930 yields an element of @xmath938 preserved by all reidemeister moves .",
    "however , if @xmath911 is only a rack , then @xmath930 is an invariant of @xmath939 and @xmath940 ( a so called invariant of regular isotopy ) , thus @xmath930 yields an element of @xmath938 invariant up to regular isotopy .",
    "one can improve ( iv ) slightly and make our cycle invariant @xmath930 more useful by noting that @xmath930 yields an invariant of framed isotopy . here",
    "we observe that we can move a  kink \" of the first reidemeister move under another arc using @xmath939 and @xmath940 only , and cancel contributions from  kinks \" of the opposite sign , as long as they are in the same component .",
    "the above considerations have been generalized to surfaces in 4-space , or more generally , to codimension two embeddings ; in fact , it was an initial motivation for fenn , rourke , and sanderson to introduce rack homology around 1990 .",
    "there is another remarkable cocycle invariant developed in @xcite for codimension 2 embeddings , coming from shadow colorings by elements of @xmath2 .",
    "it is a 3-cocycle invariant in classical knot theory ( we formulate it below in a homology language and with a dimension shift ; thus we construct a 2-cycle in @xmath690 ) .",
    "@xcite[definition 10.1 ] let @xmath303 be a rack and @xmath900 an oriented link diagram .",
    "we decorate arcs of @xmath900 by elements of @xmath0 as in the previous definition ( figure 10.1 ) .",
    "additionally , we color regions of @xmath941 by elements of @xmath0 according to the convention : ( the small arrow is added to record a positive orientation of the projection surface ) . for a given shadow coloring we define a 2-cycle @xmath942 as the sum over all crossings of @xmath900 of terms @xmath943 according to the convention of figure 10.6 : +   +     +    figure 10.6 ; building a 2-chain for an oriented link diagram using a shadow coloring     + one can check that @xmath944 is a 2-cycle in @xmath945 .",
    "further , @xmath944 is preserved by the second reidemeister move ( to see the cancellation of contributions from two new crossings after @xmath939 , we should just put together crossings of figure 10.6 ) . with a little more effort",
    "one shows that @xmath946 is a boundary ( e.g. if we shade regions of figure 10.4 , with the bottom region labelled by @xmath149 , then @xmath947 ) .",
    "thus @xmath944 and @xmath948 are homologous in @xmath949 . to summarize",
    ", the homology class of @xmath944 is a regular isotopy invariant .",
    "+ if @xmath303 is a quandle , we can work with quandle homology @xmath950 , and because the contribution of the new crossing in a first reidemeister move is a degenerate element , the class of @xmath944 in @xmath950 is preserved by all reidemeister moves .",
    "if we only care about the third reidemeister move of figure 10.4 , we can work with any shelf @xmath303 .",
    "the usefulness of working only with some reidemeister moves may be debated , but there is already a considerable body of literature on the topic @xcite .",
    "[ remark 10.2 ] recall that the map @xmath951 is given by + @xmath952 and that , as noted in lemma [ lemma 8.7 ] , @xmath953 is a chain map on @xmath954 . if @xmath955 , as is the case for rack homology , then @xmath953 is a chain map .",
    "our observation is that @xmath956 , which follows from the construction , but should have some interesting consequences .",
    "it is true , in general , that for a given @xmath216-dimensional  diagram \" @xmath900 of an @xmath216-dimensional manifold in @xmath957 , the @xmath216-chain corresponding to a shadow coloring of @xmath900 is sent by @xmath958 to a coloring of @xmath900 .",
    "we plan to address the significance of this in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a shelf and @xmath959 a free module over a commutative ring @xmath960 with basis @xmath0 ( we can call @xmath959 a _ linear shelf _ ) .",
    "let @xmath961 , then @xmath962 and the operation @xmath24 yields a linear map @xmath963 given by @xmath964 .",
    "right self - distributivity of @xmath24 gives the equation of linear maps @xmath965 : @xmath966 in general , the equation of type ( 1 ) is called a yang - baxter equation and the map @xmath212 a yang - baxter operator .",
    "we also often require that @xmath212 is invertible .",
    "with relation to this , we notice that if @xmath24 is invertible then @xmath967 is invertible with @xmath968 .",
    "in our case @xmath967 permutes the base @xmath969 of @xmath970 , so it is called a permutation or a set theoretical yang - baxter operator .",
    "our distributive homology , in particular our rack homology @xmath971 , can be thought of as the homology of @xmath212 .",
    "it was generalized from the yang - baxter operator coming from a self - distributive @xmath24 to any permutational yang - baxter operator ( coming from biracks or biquandles ) , @xcite .",
    "for a general yang - baxter operator , there is no general homology theory ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the goal / hope is to define homology for any yang - baxter operator , so that the yang - baxter operator defining the jones polynomial leads to a version of khovanov homology .",
