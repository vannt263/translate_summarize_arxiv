    "in non - local games , two non - communicating players cooperate in order to achieve a task .",
    "each player receives an input and produces an output , and they must satisfy the task s requirements .    in physics , this class of games is also known as `` entangled games '' .",
    "they are mostly used to investigate the power of entanglement , by designing intuitive bell inequalities .",
    "one designs a non - local game and proves an upper bound on the winning probability of the classical players ( the bell inequality ) . later",
    ", one shows that there exists a quantum strategy that by using entanglement can beat that winning probability .",
    "two famous examples of such approach are the chsh game ( based on @xcite ) and the magic square game ( based on @xcite ) .",
    "non - local games are also important in computer science , where they are usually called `` two - prover one - round games '' .",
    "their intuitive nature has been used in complexity theory to approach the difficult problem of p vs. np , by defining probabilistically checkable proofs and ultimately leading to the famous unique games conjecture @xcite .    estimating or bounding the value of a game given its description is an important task , and much effort has been devoted to the question . for example , the entangled value for the class of xor games has been shown to be easy to compute with a semidefinite program by cirelson @xcite .",
    "also the entangled value of unique games turns out to be easy to compute , therefore falsifying the unique games conjecture in the quantum world @xcite .    here",
    ", we propose a general approach to bound the value of a non - local game based on graph theory .",
    "given the description of a game , we construct a graph that contains all the information about the game , and we call it the `` game graph '' . the construction is based on the techniques in @xcite .",
    "such techniques have also been extended and used in @xcite .",
    "we first show that the classical value of any game is equal to the independence number of its game graph ( renormalized ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that computing exactly the classical value of a game is np - hard .",
    "we then show an efficiently computable upper bound on the quantum value of a game ( and therefore on the classical value ) , given by the celebrated lovsz theta number .",
    "we then give lower bound for the games on the uniform distribution given by the quantum independence number , a graph parameter introduced in @xcite and futher discussed in @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we give a class of games for which this upper bound is tight .",
    "we believe this graph - theoretical approach is an important and a fertile field for improvements .",

    ", they apply the corresponding measurements to their parts of the entangled state and produce classical outputs @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the winning probability of a strategy is calculated as follows : @xmath21    the _ entangled value _",

    "we have a bell inequality violation for a game @xmath0 if the entangled value is strictly larger than the classical one . the violation is quantified by the ratio @xmath23 .",

    "the inputs @xmath24 and @xmath25 are uniformly distributed , and alice and bob win the game if their respective outputs @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 ; in other words , @xmath6 should equal @xmath7 unless @xmath29 .",
    "the classical value of this game is easily seen to be @xmath30 , while the entangled value is known to be @xmath31 .",

    "the theta number can be approximated to within arbitrary precision in polynomial time , hence it gives a tractable and in many cases useful bound for @xmath50 .      in this section",
    "we define the quantum independence number and state some of its properties .",
    "first , let us briefly give some historical background . in  @xcite the concept of quantum independence number",
    "is presented in the context of zero - error information theory .",
    "this quantity is usually called in literature `` one - shot zero - error entanglement - assisted channel capacity '' and denoted as @xmath51 . a new definition of quantum independence number , denoted as @xmath52 , came in  @xcite , in the context of graph homomorphisms . as of today , it is not known if the two quantities are equal for all graphs . in this paper",
    "we use the second quantity , but for simplicity we omit the details about homomorphisms and provide a direct definition .    as with the quantum chromatic number ( see @xcite ) , the quantum independence number can be defined in terms of a non - local game . informally , the _ independent set game _ with parameter @xmath53 for a graph @xmath32 is as follows .",
    "two players , alice and bob , claim that they know an independent set @xmath39 of @xmath40 consisting of @xmath53 vertices .",
    "a referee wants to test this claim with a non - local game .",
    "he forbids communication between the players , generates two uniformly random numbers @xmath54 $ ] and separately asks alice to provide the @xmath1-th vertex of @xmath39 and bob to provide the @xmath2-th vertex of @xmath39 .",
    "the players are required to output the same vertex if @xmath55 , and to output non - adjacent vertices if @xmath56 . a formal definition follows .    the _ independent set game with parameter @xmath53 _ on the graph @xmath32 is a non - local game with input sets @xmath57 $ ] , output sets @xmath58 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath5 is the uniform distribution on the input pairs .",
    "alice gets input @xmath1 and outputs @xmath59 , bob gets input @xmath2 and outputs @xmath60 .",
    "the players _ lose the game _ in the following two cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath61 2 .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath44 or @xmath62    a classical strategy consists w.l.o.g .",
    "of two deterministic functions",
    "@xmath63 \\rightarrow v$ ] for alice and for bob . shared randomness , as seen for the coloring game , is not beneficial",
    ". a little thought will show that to win with probability 1 , we must have @xmath64 ( to avoid the first losing condition ) and that @xmath65 must be a valid independent set of the graph of size @xmath53 ( to avoid the second losing condition ) .",
    "it follows that the classical players can not win the game with probability @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",

    "quantum strategies for the independent set game consist of projective measurements on a maximally entangled state , that the projective measurements of alice and bob are the same and that all the projectors can be real - valued .",

    "we generalize to all games .    for simplicity ,",
    "we prove the results in this section for the case where the game has the uniform distribution on the inputs and @xmath78 is a boolean function .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize to games with real - valued predicate and any probability distribution @xmath5 of the inputs , as follows .",
    "consider the ( vertex ) weighted graph with all the quadruples @xmath79 in the vertex set , labelled with @xmath80 , and the same edge set as before .",
    "the classical bound and the lovsz theta bound that we will prove later can be adapted by considering the weighted versions of these parameters .",
    "however , we do not know how to generalize our last result because we do not define the quantum independence number for a weighted graph .",
    "now we prove that that the classical value of a game can be expressed in terms of the independence number of its game graph .",
    "[ theorem : omega_c]let @xmath72 be a non - local game with input sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , uniform input distribution and associated graph @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath81    let @xmath82 we begin by proving that @xmath83 .",
    "namely , we show that given a maximal independent set @xmath84 of size @xmath85 , we can exhibit a strategy for @xmath72 that answers correctly to at least @xmath85 of the @xmath86 questions . by the structure of @xmath40 , the independent set  @xmath39 can not contain vertices @xmath79 and @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 can not contain vertices @xmath79 and @xmath89 such that @xmath90 .",

    "bob behaves similarly .",
    "since @xmath33 contains only winning quadruples @xmath79 , the size @xmath85 of the independent set means alice and bob answer correctly to at least @xmath85 input pairs .",
    "hence , @xmath91 .",
    "now we show that @xmath92 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if there exists a strategy that wins on @xmath85 of the @xmath86 input pairs , then there exists an independent set with weight @xmath85 .",
    "we have that w.l.o.g .",
    "classical strategies consist of a pair of functions .",
    "fix alice and bob s functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 that win on @xmath85 input pairs .",
    "now take the set of quadruples @xmath95 .",
    "we have that @xmath96 is a set of @xmath85 vertices of @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath97 and @xmath98 are deterministic , @xmath39 can not contain vertices @xmath79 and @xmath87 such that @xmath88 nor vertices @xmath79 and @xmath89 such that @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , there can not be an edge between any pair of the elements of @xmath39 and we have that @xmath39 is an independent set of @xmath40 of size @xmath85 .",

    "cabello , severini and winter @xcite observe that the quantum value of the chsh game is equal to the theta number of its associated graph divided by the number of questions .",
    "we have found by direct calculation that this is not always true for general games , for example in the case of the 2-fold parallel repetition of chsh .",
    "the same conclusion follows from the results of acn _ et al . _ in @xcite .",
    "here we prove the upper bound directly for our specific constructions .",

    "consider a quantum strategy for @xmath72 that achieves the value @xmath22 .",

    "let @xmath114 be positive semidefinite matrices .",
