    "the correspondence relating @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory to type iib strings propagating on @xmath5 has been tested in many different ways .",
    "the first tests involved matching computations in the supergravity limit of the string theory and the corresponding ones in the conformal field theory ( cft ) following the proposal in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was realised that the anomalous dimensions of operators in this theory are given by the energy spectrum of a spin - chain@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 theory has a high degree of symmetry and thus it is of interest to understand versions with lesser symmetry .",
    "orbifolds of this theory provide one obvious class of cfts@xcite .",
    "these lead to theories which are dual to type iib string theory propagating on @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are five manifolds that are orbifolds of @xmath8 .",
    "more generally , @xmath7 must be a sasaki - einstein manifold . a new class of such manifolds that lead to cft s with @xmath9 supersymmetry",
    "have also been constructed recently .",
    "these manifolds have been called @xmath10 spaces  cones over these spaces are ricci - flat non - compact six dimensional manifolds with @xmath11 holonomy and are natural generalisations of the conifold @xcite .",
    "thus , these are examples where both sides of the ads - cft correspondence are understood even though we do not fully understand string theory on ads spaces .    from a field",
    "theoretic perspective , leigh and strassler@xcite considered ( multi - parameter ) marginal deformations of @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory that preserve @xmath9 supersymmetry and are conformal .",
    "we shall refer to these theories are known as the leigh - strassler ( ls ) theories . while there have been attempts @xcite to understand",
    "the anticipated dual string theories for these field theories , the precise correspondence is not known in all generality . an important development due to lunin and maldacena @xcite was the construction of the gravity duals for the @xmath12-deformed @xmath0 sym which is a sub - class in the generalised ls family of @xmath9 theories .",
    "rational values of @xmath13 in the deformation turn out to be related to @xmath14 orbifolds of @xmath8 with discrete torsion@xcite .",
    "the most general leigh - strassler @xmath9 preserving deformations of @xmath0 sym is given ( in superfields ) by the following superpotential : @xmath15 the @xmath0 limit occurs when @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath12-deformed theory is obtained when @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for generic values of the deformations , the global symmetry of the deformed theory",
    "is the trihedral group @xmath1 with its centre being a @xmath20 sub - group of the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation when @xmath21 , where one has a @xmath22 symmetry which is intimately related to the toric nature of these spaces .",
    "the ls deformations are parametrised by the four couplings : @xmath23 ( the yang - mills coupling constant ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "while these are all marginal at the classical level , they are not all marginal in the quantum theory . however , it has been argued by leigh and strassler that in a subspace of the four - dimensional space of couplings , the theory is conformal .",
    "in particular , the vanishing the four beta functions is related to the vanishing of the anomalous dimension of the scalars fields . the exact expression for the subspace",
    "is not known .",
    "however , it is known to two loops and is given by @xmath27 in the large @xmath4 limit that we pursue in this paper , the above condition simplifies to @xmath28 we also choose to work with real @xmath12 which is possible at the one - loop level . in principle , this can be done at higher loops as well since the imaginary part of @xmath12 can be gotten rid of by redefining @xmath24 .",
    "perturbative studies of the @xmath12-deformed theory have been carried out by several authors@xcite .",
    "chiral primaries of these theories are known well at least in the planar ( large-@xmath4 ) case@xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet finiteness of the @xmath12-deformed theory has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and a proof of its ultraviolet finiteness at the planar level has also appeared recently@xcite .    for the general ls deformations , the anomalous dimensions for chiral operators with low values of scaling dimension has been carried out ( using super - graphs ) in ref .",

    "this paper focuses on a planar one - loop computation of anomalous dimensions of single trace operators in order to systematically search for operators that are protected in the ls theory . and",
    "@xmath29 , one has to consider @xmath30 operators .",

    "we find that protected operators appear in one of the three representations , @xmath31 or @xmath32 depending on the value of the scaling dimension , @xmath33 modulo three .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section two ,",
    "we present some of the background needed for the paper .",
    "in particular , we present the f - term superpotential in component form and show that it contains double trace operators . in section three , we compute the anomalous dimensions for operators of the form @xmath34 .",
    "we present the details of our computation as well as verify that all contributions that appear from non f - term interactions cancel and that our results are gauge independent . in section four , we compute the anomalous dimensions for operators up to dimension six in the @xmath12-deformed theory as a preliminary to the computing in the general leigh - strassler theory .",
    "we verify that the results are consistent with expected results up to dimension six operators . in section five which contains the main results of this paper , after organising the operators using the trihedral group",

    "it turns out that unlike the @xmath0 lagrangian , this lagrangian * can not * be written in terms of a single trace though the superfield lagrangian is written as a single trace .",
    "there are some terms that can only be written as a double trace ",
    "these terms are however suppressed by a power of @xmath35 but can not be neglected in the large @xmath4 limit as we will see .    the simplest way to see",
    "the appearance of double trace operators is to consider trace identity ( for @xmath36 generators in the fundamental representation ) : @xmath37 notice that both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both of the form @xmath40 for some @xmath41 .",
    "we thus see that @xmath42 can not be written in single trace form ( using the above identity ) unless the operators @xmath41 and @xmath43 are traceless ( as in the @xmath0 limit ) . the f - term interactions ( involving bosonic fields ) for the ls theory",

    "since the d - terms are unaffected by the leigh - strassler deformations to the superpotential , they are the identical to the one obtained in the @xmath0 theory ( written in terms of @xmath51 superfields ) .",

    "is further broken down to @xmath55 .",
    "the ls theory has another symmetry given by the cyclic permutation @xmath56 of the three scalar fields .",

    "the @xmath2 charge which is proportional to the scaling dimension for chiral primaries becomes a @xmath20 valued charge .",
    "specifically , in our conventions , the value of the scaling dimension , @xmath33 , modulo three is the @xmath20 charge .",
    "historically , the appearance of a 27 parameter non - abelian discrete subgroup was first noticed in ref .",
    "our attention to the appearance of the @xmath1 was drawn from ref .",
    "@xcite which attributed it to s. benvenuti .",
    "we have found the trihedral group extremely useful in organising the chiral operators .",
    "for instance , it reduced the number of free parameters for an operator at dimension six from @xmath30 to three different operators with @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath62 parameters .",
    "one may ask whether @xmath1 remains a symmetry of the quantum theory . as argued by leigh and strassler ,",
    "the full quantum effective potential will continue to be of the same form as the classical one .",
    "in other words , quantum corrections renormalised the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath63 will remain a symmetry of the superpotential . for @xmath1 to be a symmetry in the quantum theory , however it is also necessary that the khler potential also respects this symmetry .",
    "the tree - level khler potential does respect the symmetry and one needs to check if this remains true at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we have not resolved this issue completely and hope to report on this in the future . since our one - loop computation makes use of only tree - level interactions ,",
    "the use of @xmath1 is a valid one .",
    "another useful invariance of the action is the following : @xmath64 this is _ not _ a symmetry since it acts on the couplings as well .",
    "this however leads to restrictions on the possible renormalisation of coupling constants .",
    "the propagators for the various fields are as follows , where feynman gauge has been chosen to write down the gauge propagator .",
    "@xmath65 we have explicitly verified the gauge independence of our results by working in the landau gauge as well .",
    "in @xmath9 gauge theories , it is known that holomorphy is the basis for certain non - renormalisation theorems@xcite . in order to prove properties that make use of holomorphy",
    ", one usually works in superfields and regularisation schemes that are compatible with holomorphy . in our context",
    "where we are computing anomalous dimensions of operators involving scalars that arise from chiral superfields , holomorphy implies that the only interaction terms that contribute to the anomalous dimension are those that arise from @xmath67-terms as we will explicitly verify .    in computing the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath68 ,",
    "we compute the two - point function of this operator with its conjugate operator , which we denote by @xmath69 and study its singularity when the two operators are coincident .",
    "one expects @xmath70 where @xmath33 is the naive scaling dimension of operator and @xmath71 its anomalous dimension .",
    "thus the anomalous dimension is computed extracting the logarithmic singularities and summing over all such contributions .    for the family of operators",
    "@xmath72 , we find that , at large @xmath4 ( i.e. , in the planar limit ) , the one - loop contribution to the anomalous dimension from all interactions take the following form ( on using dimensional regularisation ) : @xmath73 when the sum of all contributions is such that the coefficient of @xmath74 vanishes , we obtain a candidate for the chiral primary .",
    "recall that for chiral primaries , the scaling dimension is determined entirely by its @xmath2-charge and hence should receive * no * corrections . for a true chiral primary",
    ", @xmath71 vanishes to all orders .",
    "so the vanishing of the planar one - loop contribution to any operator does not imply that it is a chiral primary since it could obtain contributions at higher orders .",
    "however , such operators provide us with candidates for chiral primaries .",
    "since we are working in component form , we need to explicitly verify that all non - holomorphic contributions to the anomalous dimensions of chiral fields cancel out .",
    "these contributions should vanish irrespective of whether the operator is a chiral primary or not .",
    "while this is expected @xcite , we use this computation as a non - trivial check of our results .",
    "such contributions come from three kinds of terms :    * * d - term : * figures [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] arise from the d - term interaction vertex + @xmath75[z_j,\\bar{z}_j]\\big)$ ] . + [ z_1,\\bar{z}_1]\\big)$ ] .",
