    "the riemann surface of genus two serves as geometry carrier in a great number of the models of string theory  @xcite , statistical physics  @xcite , chaology  @xcite , low - dimensional gravity  @xcite .",
    "problems , in which surface geometry is not fixed and is developing in time , have a special interest .",
    "the changes of underlying geometry can be described in different ways , for instance , by evolution equations , by averaging over surface moduli or parameters , etc .",
    "then it is naturally to require the surface deformation to be represented by continuous and smooth trajectory in a some space with the properties which should be carefully studied .",
    "although the case of genus two gives us access to quite explicit calculations , most of problems can not be solved in general .",
    "this fact forces us to concentrate on a family of the surfaces with the reduced number of geometric degrees of freedom . using the more convenient geometric approach we consider the surfaces represented by two - parametric hyperbolic octagons embedded into the unit disk .    assuming that an octagon form remains the same under rotation by @xmath0",
    ", we first construct the fundamental domain with opposite sides identified and the associated fuchsian group , using as `` input '' the two real parameters : length and angle , determining the position of vertices , i.e. the octagon geometry . although the general formalism linking the geometric data and the fuchsian group is known  @xcite , we pay great attention to manifest dependence of octagon boundary segments and isometry group generators on these parameters in order to make the functions straightforwardly applicable in forthcoming calculations .",
    "we aim to investigate a real - analytic structure of parameter space , that is dictated by isometry group of teichmller space , usually called as the mapping class group , and essentially determines an initial octagon evolution in various physical problems .",
    "thus , to realise this , we introduce teichmller space for the surfaces under consideration as a subset of total teichmller space for all surfaces in genus two and compute the fenchel - nielsen variables regarding as the global coordinates on it .",
    "we perform main analysis ( in section 3 ) within the weil - petersson geometry allowing us to endow the parameter space with the symplectic two - form which is invariant by definition under action of the mapping class group .",
    "key tool is the wolpert s formula  @xcite permitting us to express this form in terms of the fenchel - nielsen variables . as the result",
    ", we shall see that the accessibility domain of geometric data used is the symplectic orbifold .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry group of the reduced teichmller space is expected to be wide than the mapping class group because of geometric constraints imposed .",
    "note that the involution of the surfaces with an order four automorphism and the associated generators are diskussed in details in @xcite .",
    "we supplement our results by description of the isoperimetric orbits in the parameter space ( section 4 ) , what gives us additional information about the structure of this space and reflects a particular diffeomorphism of octagon . on the other hand ,",
    "the dense set of isoperimetric orbits can serve as a tool for further geometric quantization , independent of the octagon automorphisms and pants decompositions .",
    "physically , such an approach leads to a study of the quantum spectra and quantum fluctuations of geometric quantities of the objects with the same topology / geometry but of different nature .",
    "we will deal with the poincar model of two - dimensional hyperbolic space , namely , with the open unit disk centered at the origin , @xmath1 endowed with the metric @xmath2 of the gaussian curvature @xmath3 .",
    "hyperbolic distance between complex coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 in space @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 and determined from relation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euclidean distance .",
    "solution to the geodesic equation in @xmath6 is the function : @xmath10 which is defined in the interval @xmath11 and describes an arc inside @xmath12 with radius @xmath13 and center at the point @xmath14 lying beyond the unit disk . in particular case ,",
    "the geodesics emanating from the origin are the euclidean straight lines ( diameters ) .",
    "all geodesics intersect the boundary @xmath15 orthogonally .",
    "the group of all orientation - preserving isometries of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath16 , acts via the mbius transformation : @xmath17=\\frac{uz+v}{\\overline{v}z+\\overline{u}},\\quad z\\in\\mathbb{d},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are complex numbers satisfying relation @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the complex conjugates .",
    "thus , it is convenient to identify a generator @xmath23 with an element of group @xmath24 , @xmath25    we shall concentrate on the properties of riemann surface @xmath26 of genus @xmath27 , which is understood here as a compact two - dimensional orientable manifold with the riemannian metric of the constant negative curvature",
    ". such a surface is obtained from a hyperbolic simply connected octagon @xmath28 in @xmath12 via gluing opposite sides formed by eight geodesic arcs , whose intersections serve as vertices .    in our model , which has been already declared and geometrically described in  @xcite , we assume that the vertices are at the points @xmath29 , @xmath30}$ ] , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "we also require the sum of the inner angles of @xmath28 to be equal to @xmath34 .",
    "this is the same as requiring @xmath35 in accordance with the gauss - bonnet theorem  @xcite .",
    "such an octagon ( sketched in figure  1 , left panel ) is two - parametric : we choose a pair @xmath36 as independent real variables while parameter @xmath37 together with the parameters of geodesics ( sides ) are functions of those .",
    "although the surface of genus @xmath38 is generally determined by @xmath39 real parameters , we reduce 6-parametric object to 2-parametric one by imposing constraints that simplifies considerations .",
    "therefore , the model octagon @xmath28 can be viewed as a `` minimal deformation '' of the regular hyperbolic octagon with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , well studied in the context of the chaology ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the octagon we have obtained is stable under rotation by @xmath0 .",
    "it means that the surface has an order four automorphism .",

    "these geodesics are completely determined by the radii @xmath48 and the angles @xmath49 , @xmath33 ( see ( [ xy ] ) ) , defining the positions of the circle centers . satisfying the conditions imposed above ( and collected in manifest form in appendix of @xcite ) , we obtain that @xmath50},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and @xmath52    moreover , introducing the inner angle @xmath53 by vertices @xmath29 ( the angle by vertices + @xmath30}$ ] is then equal to @xmath54 ) such that @xmath55 we should control the condition @xmath56 , determining the region of variety of parameters @xmath36 : @xmath57 which is sketched in figure  4 below .",
    "the last formulae define a domain , which we denote by @xmath58 , whose points completely determine the geometry of octagon @xmath28 .",
    "our aim is to investigate the structure of @xmath58 .    to complete geometry description ,",
    "the parameter @xmath37 , pointed out in figure  1 , is calculated as @xmath59    note that the manifest dependence of the octagon parameters on the pair @xmath36 is necessary in the different problems where geometry is not fixed . for instance , @xmath36 would be dynamical variables in topological field theory and gravity ; it is able to average over @xmath36 in statistical physics , etc .    in order to define the riemann surface @xmath26 based on the geometrical model ,",
    "let us recall that the opposite sides of @xmath28 have the same lengths by construction .",
    "we therefore have a uniquely defined isometry @xmath60 mapping geodesic boundary segment @xmath61 onto @xmath62 for all @xmath33 ( see figure  1 , right panel ) .",

    "a hyperbolic riemann surface of genus @xmath38 without boundary always contains a system of @xmath117 simple closed geodesics that are neither homotopic to each other nor homotopically trivial . regardless of",

    "surface @xmath26 constructed is two - holed torus which can be decomposed into two pairs of pants by a system of three closed geodesics .",

    "one of those is an area , fixed by the gauss  bonnet theorem and equal to @xmath170 for genus two .",

    "the perimeter is given by the formula : @xmath171    in a some sense , this characteristic is a good candidate due to invariance of @xmath172 under the octagon automorphisms and pants decomposition .",
    "it means that @xmath172 can take on the same value for various values of @xmath36 . in this section",
    ", we are aiming to describe the corresponding orbits .",
    "evidence of this fact came from numerical investigation of information entropy within the model of directed random walk on the cayley tree generated by the fuchsian group ( [ g0])-([gn ] ) , where the perimeter and the entropy are connected  @xcite .",

    "therefore , the maximal symmetry of the regular octagon explains an extremum of information entropy observed previously .",
    "this fact could be important in description of the physical systems , in which geometry carrier ( two - holed torus ) changes .    substituting ( [ asol ] ) in ( [ per ] ) and resolving the equation obtained with respect to @xmath187",
