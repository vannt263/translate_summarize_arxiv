    "during the last years loop quantum cosmology @xcite ( lqc ) has become an attractive area of research for cosmology and quantum gravity community . the loop quantum gravity @xcite ( lqg ) which inspired quantization of the symmetry reduced cosmological models , allows one to address fundamental questions about the fate of classical singularity and quantum gravitational corrections in the early universe . while the topic of the isotropic and homogeneous sector of the lqc originated in @xcite is well understood @xcite",
    "there still is work to be done in the homogeneous , but nonisotropic sector .",
    "although loop quantum dynamics is not fully understood in this sector , already the first calculations in the quantum homogeneous models @xcite suggest a completely different structure of the space - time near classical singularities . after the discovery of the so - called `` improved scheme '' in @xcite , analytical issues of kinematics and dynamics",
    "were studied in detail in the case of the simplest homogeneous diagonal bianchi type i ( bi ) model @xcite .",
    "although there has been recent progress in the lqc diagonal bi model at the level of effective equations of motion @xcite , the predictions coming directly from the quantum theory are still missing .",
    "potential numerical simulations of the quantum dynamics in the theory constructed in @xcite are more difficult than in the isotropic case @xcite because of the complexity of the quantum scalar constraint . while the numerical study of the @xcite model is still to be done ,",
    "we can in the meantime focus our attention on recent papers @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a small simplification in the quantum theory leads to an exactly soluble lqc model .",
    "similar simplifications enable us to prove self - adjointness of the quantum hamiltonian in a purely analytical manner @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to investigate similar simplifications in the lqc diagonal bianchi i model .",
    "similar results have also been obtained independently by the madrid group @xcite .",
    "furthermore , so far in the literature there are two kinds of `` loop regularization '' of the gravitational part of the scalar constraint for the bi models described in @xcite , the so - called @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 scheme has better scaling properties ( see @xcite ) ; however , a quantum theory for this scheme is much more difficult to construct . in this paper",
    "we study the @xmath0 scheme quantization described in @xcite and simplify it to some extent .",
    "unfortunately , such a theory has a limited domain of applicability .",
    "full scaling invariance with respect to the different choices of the fiducial cell is broken , which causes fiducial cell and fiducial metric dependence on the semiclassical limit for the fiducial cells ( and fiducial metric ) different from cubical ( see sec .",
    "[ 3b ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "these problems are especially important for the case of noncompact topology of the three - dimensional spatial slice @xmath2 of the foliation , where different shapes of the fiducial cells ( and fiducial metrics different than isotropic ) are allowed",
    ". the quantum theory should be invariant with respect to changes to different fiducial cells ( and fiducial metrics ) just like the classical theory does respect this invariance .",
    "the model here does not respect the fiducial invariance , resulting in the semiclassical limit of the theory is being unfortunately ill defined .",

    "if we want to pass to the hamiltonian formulation for our bi model we must be careful , because the scalar constraint ( [ total - sc ] ) for the metric ( [ metric ] ) is infinite . in order to make the integration over spatial slice finite we can replace @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a finite cell or , in the case of bianchi i , we can choose topology of @xmath2 to be a three - dimensional torus . the metric tensor given by the ( [ metric ] )",

    "let us now define , for the purpose of the quantum theory , a new symplectic structure as @xmath42 where new variables are defined as @xmath43 the classical solutions ( [ p - phi ] ) in terms of new variables @xmath44 are in the form @xmath45 where we put @xmath46 , because @xmath47 can be positive or negative .",
    "the total physical volume of the fiducial cell ( or a 3-torus ) is defined as @xmath48 .",
    "a quantum theory in the improved ( or not improved , so - called @xmath49 ) scheme was constructed in detail in @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we briefly recall the kinematics of the diagonal bianchi i model in the so - called @xmath0 scheme .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space is given by @xmath50 with the orthonormal basis elements labeled by three real numbers @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the bohr compactification of a real line .",
    "the kinematical scalar product is defined as @xmath53 any state @xmath54 can be decomposed in the orthonormal basis as @xmath55 with the norm @xmath56 given by @xmath57 there exists a volume operator defined as @xmath58 which is constructed from the components of the volume operator as @xmath59 .",
    "the constant @xmath60 will be determined later .",
    "each of the @xmath61 operators is given by @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the operators corresponding to the connection components @xmath64 do not exist in @xmath65 , but there are important unitary shift operators ( for @xmath63 ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( and there is no sum over @xmath33 ) .",
    "their action on a basis element is defined as follows @xmath68",
    "in the paper @xcite one can find a detailed construction of the operator corresponding to the ( [ constr ] ) in the full loop quantum gravity scheme .",
    "the full lqg quantization of the scalar constraint ( [ total - sc ] ) gives us quantum corrections to the term @xmath69 by the so - called thiemann trick .",
    "it also gives quantum corrections to the term @xmath70 by su@xmath71 holonomy along a suitable loop ( see eqs . ( 5.2 ) and ( 5.4 ) in @xcite for the case of the diagonal bianchi i model ) .",
    "however , the simplified lqc model proposed in @xcite can be interpreted as a quantum model , where only the lqg effects coming from curvature 2-from @xmath70 are taken into account . in a similar way we construct in this section an operator corresponding to ( [ reg1 ] ) where only a curvature 2-form @xmath72 is loop quantized ,",
    "so in order to simplify quantum theory the thiemann trick is simply ignored .",
    "therefore , we can use a regularized version of ( [ reg1 ] ) ( described in @xcite ) given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath60 stands for the minimal non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator @xcite .",
    "let us now investigate the last two expressions in more detail .",
    "the ( [ reg ] ) was obtained in two steps .",
    "firstly the fiducial cell @xmath75 was introduced in order to make the scalar constraint ( [ total - sc ] ) finite . secondly the loop regularization with the condition ( [ mu bar ] ) was used to obtain the formula ( [ reg ] ) . because there is no preferred fiducial cell @xmath14",
    "the theory should not depend on the choice of the fiducial cell .",
    "in other words the two different cells should give the same physical evolution .",
    "this indeed is the case for the isotropic @xmath76 model @xcite .",
    "however , for the quantum model determined by ( [ reg ] ) the situation is different .",
    "it can be easily seen from the ( [ reg ] ) , namely the expression @xmath77 ( the scaling properties for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 are analogous ) . let us notice that @xmath80 now , if we rescale our fiducial cell as @xmath81 the ( [ mu1 ] ) is rescaled according to the ( [ resc ] ) as @xmath82 the expression @xmath83 is then not invariant under the change of the fiducial cell .",
    "the @xmath77 is promoted to the shift operator by ( [ shift1 ] ) , so it seems that the magnitude of the volume shift in the operator corresponding to the ( [ reg ] ) is fiducial scale dependent .",
    "this property can be summarized as follows : the classical dynamics does not depend on the choice of the fiducial cell , while the quantum dynamics does .",
    "such behavior is very unfortunate , because it can generate several problems as in the old isotropic lqc models .",
    "one can argue that for the 3-torus topology where the total coordinate volume of the spatial slice @xmath2 is fixed , the @xmath0 condition has correct implementation @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of noncompact @xmath2 topology there is no doubt that ( [ limitat ] ) is a serious defect .",
    "so what can we do about it ?",
    "there are at least two possibilities .",
    "we can develop a better loop regularization with correct scaling properties or we can assume that the only consistent ( partial ) solution of the rescaling problem is to use only cubical fiducial cells .",
    "then for the cubical choice we have @xmath84 ( @xmath63 ) and only for the rescaling defined by @xmath85 ( each @xmath86 ) the ( [ limitat ] ) and the volume shift defined by @xmath87 ( @xmath63 ) are invariant . in the rest of this paper",
    "the cubical shape assumption of the fiducial cell is made .",
    "moreover , also the fiducial metric @xmath88 must be assumed to be isotropic .",
    "our task now is to promote ( [ reg ] ) to a well - defined , symmetric operator .",
    "let us start with a matter term @xmath89 . because we are interested only in quantum gravitational effects the scalar field @xmath90 is quantized as usual @xmath91 where @xmath92 belongs to the total kinematical hilbert space defined as @xmath93 .",
    "the next step is to use kinematical tools described in the previous section to get an operator corresponding to the function @xmath94 defined as follows @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "let us now fix the factor ordering ambiguity of the ( [ reg ] ) operator in a following way .",

    "let us now focus on the scaling properties of the gravitational part of the scalar constraint .",
    "if we allow one to scale @xmath233 , where all @xmath234 are different for @xmath63 ( the fiducial cell becomes cuboid ) then the spectrum of the operator ( [ scalar vol ] ) scales as @xmath235 where @xmath236 and @xmath237 are some numbers determined by @xmath238 .",
    "for @xmath239 we have @xmath240 and then semiclassical states ( [ semi - state ] ) do not give correct classical limit . the quantum trajectory defined by ( [ e - value ] ) simply does not follow the classical one as one can see in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",

    "the fiducial cell is rescaled in one direction as @xmath242 , where @xmath243.,title=\"fig : \" ]    thus the semiclassical limit with respect to ( [ semi - state ] ) is fiducial cell dependent .",
    "moreover , the shift operators defined by @xmath244 correspond to the different steps after rescaling @xmath245 , in contrast to the @xmath76 model @xcite , where the step defined by the @xmath246 is invariant under @xmath85 .",
    "one can conclude that for each choice of the ( noncubical ) fiducial cell @xmath14 ( and fiducial metric ) the model has different quantum dynamics , while it seems reasonable to expect that the quantum model should generate only one physical dynamics . the only consistent fiducial cell is a cube with the rescaling of the scale factors @xmath247 .",
    "then @xmath248 , the spectrum is invariant @xmath249 , and the semiclassical limit defined by ( [ semi - state ] ) is correct .",
    "let us conclude that the @xmath0 quantization scheme which is highly successful in isotropic models , applied for the bianchi i in @xcite has its problems described above .",
    "the classical theory allows one to consider many different fiducial cells , while the quantum model allows only the cubical one .",
    "moreover , the fiducial metric @xmath250 also must be isotropic , which is a serious limitation .",
    "although for the 3-torus topology of the spatial slice @xmath2 with fixed coordinate volume @xmath251 the @xmath0 scheme can make sense @xcite , for the noncompact @xmath2 topology the model is tentative and should be considered as such .",
    "now what about future directions for the given model ?",
    "it seems necessary to carry out the analysis involving the curvature invariants in order to investigate the scaling properties of the model , especially at the bounce .",
    "however , our results suggest that the @xmath0 scheme applied to the bi model does not have correct scaling properties even at the bounce .",
    "we conclude that the new way of loop regularization and its quantization is needed .",
    "also similar problems may arise in a large class of models based on arbitrary discretizations such as lattice refinement models , so one should be more careful with respect to the regularization of the constraints .",

    "let us consider the following 3d fourier transform @xmath272 if again the fourier profile @xmath273 is sharply distributed , the integral can be approximated by @xmath274 if the boundary of the integration region defined by @xmath275 and @xmath276 ( for @xmath63 ) is appropriately chosen .",
    "the next step is to approximate the above integral by the sum [ at some point @xmath277 as @xmath278 if we set a lattice : 1 ) @xmath279 , @xmath280 and @xmath281 ; 2 ) @xmath282 , @xmath283 and @xmath284 , where @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 then ( [ 3int ] ) has the following form : @xmath291 where @xmath292 and @xmath293   \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath294 , for @xmath63 .",
