    "inflation has become one of the most important windows to connect cosmological observations to fundamental physics , such as string theory .",
    "recent studies on string theory show evidence that inflation may happen in the string theory landscape @xcite with extremely complicated inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "one lesson from the string landscape is that the inflationary dynamics may be not as simple as one expected before , and more possibilities during inflation should be taken into consideration .",
    "inflation in the string landscape opens up a number of possibilities to test string theory by the stringy imprints on the cmb temperature fluctuations .    on the other hand , in the recent analysis of cmb anisotropy",
    ", there are several hints for new physics .",
    "if future experiments confirm some of these possibilities , they will pose challenges for inflationary cosmology and opportunities for string theory .",
    "these challenges and opportunities include :    * non - gaussianity .",
    "the wmap5 bound for local non - gaussianity is @xcite @xmath0 the result is still consistent with @xmath1 .",
    "however , the central value of @xmath2 is large and positive .",
    "if integration of more years of wmap or the planck mission confirm this result , it would rule out the simplest inflation model .",
    "the theoretical investigation of non - gaussianity include @xcite . as there is a consistency relation @xcite for single field inflation , a large and local non - gaussianity shows evidence that inflation should involve more than one field . * features in the cmb .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there may be features in the cmb scalar power spectrum .",
    "a feature in the cmb spectrum implies a departure from the standard single field slow roll inflation at a certain scale . * hemispherical power asymmetry . as shown in @xcite , the temperature - fluctuation amplitude is larger by roughly 10% in one hemisphere of the cmb map than in the other",
    "again , this asymmetry can not be explained by the simplest inflation model .",
    "it would also be interesting to see whether this difference of power also happens on smaller scales in the sky .",
    "in this paper , we propose a `` multi - stream '' inflation model , which is a double field inflation model with spontaneous breaking and restoration of an approximate symmetry .",
    "we find that with appropriate choice of parameters , our model is consistent with current observations , and can produce large non - gaussianity , features in the cmb and hemispherical power asymmetry . in section 2 , we describe the picture of multi - stream inflation and calculate the density perturbations . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the non - gaussianity of multi - stream inflation . in section 4",
    ", we give a summary of the signatures for multi - stream inflation in different parameter regions .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the background evolution and the scalar perturbation spectrum of multi - stream inflation .",
    "we consider a period of inflation involving two fields .",
    "we consider the potential @xmath3 as illustrated in fig.[fig : multi - stream ] . in the beginning , the @xmath4 direction is the inflationary direction . as @xmath4 evolves to @xmath5 ,",
    "the @xmath6 direction becomes a tachyonic direction . at this point ,",
    "the inflationary trajectory spontaneously breaks into two paths , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 in fig.[fig : multi - stream ] .",
    "the whole picture looks like a stream which splits and flows along both sides of a hill .",
    "so we call this scenario `` multi - stream '' inflation .     in this figure",
    ", we illustrate the picture of multi - stream inflation . as the inflaton rolls down the potential , it experiences a spontaneously breaking of approximate symmetry at @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "after that , the inflation trajectory branches off into two paths denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . from the viewpoint of the cmb map ,",
    "some parts of the sky with size of order @xmath11 come from path @xmath7 , and other parts of the sky come from @xmath8 . at @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , the approximate symmetry is restored and the inflationary direction becomes unique again.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as inflation continues , depending on the potential and the reheating time , the trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 may either recombine into a single trajectory ( as shown in fig.[fig : multi - stream ] ) or not . as we will see in the calculation of scalar perturbations ,",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not recombine and reheat separately , one typically has large anisotropy at the symmetry breaking scale , and requires more fine tuning to fit the cmb power spectrum .",
    "so in this note , we mainly discuss the former possibility .",
    "now let us investigate the perturbations .",
    "the perturbations of multi - stream inflation should be the same as in usual inflation models except in the regime between @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , if the potential energy of path @xmath7 and path @xmath8 are identical , multi - stream inflation also does not differ much from usual inflation models except for some amount of isocurvature perturbations , because in this case , to choose which way is not important .",
    "to have more interesting physics , we assume the paths @xmath7 and @xmath8 have a slightly different potential energy @xmath15 , with @xmath16 non - vanishing only if @xmath17 .",
    "after this setup , multi - stream inflation will have several interesting differences from the usual inflation model .",
    "firstly , the perturbations along trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 have different power spectra .",
    "it is because the tilt of the potential is typically different when @xmath18 . to be more explicit , the power spectra along the two trajectories",
    "are calculated using the local hubble parameter and the local slow roll parameters as @xmath19 the difference in the power spectra satisfies @xmath20    in position space , trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to different parts of the sky .",
    "so a difference between the power spectra @xmath21 and @xmath22 implies that on cosmological scales corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath14 , the perturbations in some regions of the sky have more power , and in some other regions of the sky have less power .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 corresponds to the scale of the whole observable universe , then trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 both span about half of the sky . in this case , multi - stream inflation provides a possible solution to the hemispherical power asymmetry problem @xcite .",
    "if the hemispherical power asymmetry is really there and with a difference of order @xmath23 in magnitude , we need @xmath24 , and @xmath9 to be the scale that comparable to the present hubble scale to explain it . as shown in the following sections , in this case , the corresponding non - gaussianity is typically @xmath25 .    in multi - stream inflation , @xmath9 could also correspond to much smaller length scales compared with the present hubble scale , depending on the explicit form of the inflationary potential . in this case , the multi - stream effect generates about @xmath26 regions on the cmb , where @xmath27 is the comoving wave number whose wavelength is the whole observable universe . in these regions , the primordial power spectrum",
    "either takes the form @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "secondly , there can be a difference of e - folding numbers for paths @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this difference results in a time delay effect for the reheating surface , thus producing extra perturbation .    to be explicit ,",
    "let @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the background e - folding numbers evaluated along trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath33 depends on the detailed form of the potential @xmath34 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the comoving scale that exits the hubble radius when @xmath10 by @xmath9 , and @xmath13 by @xmath12 as shown in fig.[fig : multi - stream ] .",
    "@xmath33 provides an extra source of curvature perturbation on the scale @xmath9 .",
    "it is because the existence of @xmath33 , thus the time delay in reheating divides the cmb sky into patches with comoving length scale @xmath11 .",
    "this anisotropy corresponds to a perturbation @xmath35 .",
    "the amount of perturbation can be calculated as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total e - folding number difference between path @xmath7 and path @xmath8 .",
    "the difference @xmath37 has two sources , namely the quantum fluctuation of the inflation @xmath38 , and the intrinsic difference in the e - folding number @xmath33 between the two paths .",
    "the total power spectrum takes the form @xmath39 we neglected the cross term @xmath40 , because if one does not consider the conversion from isocurvature perturbation to curvature perturbation , then @xmath41 and @xmath42 are uncorrelated .",
    "we will return to this issue and give a more careful analysis of eq . in the next section .",
    "the existence of @xmath33 is a mixed blessing .",
    "the good news is that @xmath33 provides a nice explanation for the features in the cmb power spectrum , because the jump of @xmath43 takes place only in a very sharp range of @xmath44 .",
    "the bad news is that when @xmath16 is not very small , to make this jump not too large , one needs some amount of tuning to be consistent with experiments .",
    "we shall estimate the amount of tuning in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the non - gaussianity of multi - stream inflation .",
    "we shall neglect the non - gaussianity produced by mechanisms other than the multi - stream effect .    to perform the calculation",
    ", we further assume that the mass of @xmath6 shortly before the hubble exit of @xmath9 is of order @xmath45 .",
    "this assumption guarantees that @xmath46 is not too light to randomly walk more than one e - fold away from the origin , and also guarantees that @xmath46 is not too heavy to have an effect .",
    "as the inflation trajectory turns at @xmath5 , a certain amount of isocurvature perturbation @xmath47 is projected to curvature perturbation .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath47 decides whether inflation will be along trajectory @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the observed curvature perturbation at @xmath9 also includes a contribution from @xmath33 , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the fraction of isocurvation which is projected onto the curvature perturbation during the change of the trajectory , @xmath50 and @xmath42 denote the curvature perturbation from projection of isocurvature perturbation and from @xmath33 respectively .",
    "there are two kinds of non - gaussianities in multi - stream inflation .",
    "firstly , the one - point probability distribution function for @xmath51 is non - gaussian .",
    "this is because the extra density fluctuation @xmath42 , coming from the e - folding number difference between trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 , peaks at two particular values : @xmath52~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we use @xmath53 to denote the probability distribution function .",
    "this should not be confused with the power spectrum @xmath54 .",
    "the contribution from the entropy perturbation @xmath50 is still gaussian .",
    "note that here we assumed for simplicity that the probability to pick up trajectory @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal .",
    "this seems natural in our discussion because we are talking about a spontaneous breaking of an approximate symmetry .",
    "one can generalize the discussion straightforwardly to the case with unequal probability between trajectories . with unequal probability",
    ", we can also provide a theory for the cmb cold spot in the multi - stream inflation framework @xcite .",
    "note that the one point distribution function is not very easy to probe , especially for one particular value @xmath9 .",
    "so we now proceed to discuss the other kind of non - gaussianity produced by multi - stream inflation .",
    "the idea is that the amount of perturbation at comoving wave number @xmath9 and the amount of perturbation at comoving wave number @xmath55 are correlated .",
    "the correlation comes from the fact that the following three effects are @xmath56 correlated with each other : 1 .",
    "an isocurvature perturbation deciding whether to go along @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the difference of the e - folding number @xmath33 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the three point correlation function can be written as @xmath59 as we have neglected non - gaussianities from sources other than the multi - stream effect , we have @xmath60 the two terms from entropy modes and @xmath33 can be written as an integration over the product of the three points and the probability distribution function , @xmath61 with the combined probability distribution function of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64~,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 takes a form of gaussian distribution @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is given in eq . with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 is the heaviside step function . to avoid @xmath72 functions",
    ", we use the normalization that the fluctuation is averaged over one hubble volume .",
    "( a familiar example is that in this normalization , the fluctuation of the inflaton takes the form @xmath73 .",
    "one can perform the integration in eq . and get @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the fraction of extra fluctuation from the multi - stream effect .",
    "now we compare the above result with the local form non - gaussianity to estimate @xmath2 in the multi - stream model .",
    "the local form @xmath2 is defined as @xmath76 or we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath77    comparing eqs .",
    "and , we have @xmath78 note that @xmath79 is a large number .",
    "we can have @xmath80 when @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "as we shall show , this needs a tuning of the shape of the potential of order @xmath83 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the tuning is of order @xmath23 .",
    "note that this non - gaussianity appears only when one wave number is near @xmath9 ( `` near '' denotes about one e - fold during inflation ) , @xmath2 is strongly scale dependent , and should have large running .",
    "we have not calculated the shape of non - gaussianity for multi - stream inflation in the present paper . however , one note that non - gaussianity is produced when @xmath85 , known as the squeezed limit in the literature .",
    "so we expect that the shape of non - gaussianity should be similar to the local shape , with large running .",
    "so the local form estimator @xmath2 should apply for our model .",
    "finally , let us discuss the sign of @xmath2 . in multi - stream inflation ,",
    "the sign of @xmath2 is determined so that a positive @xmath86 results in a larger perturbation at scale @xmath55 .",
    "for example , when a fluctuation @xmath87 decides that the field roll to trajectory @xmath7 , with @xmath88 , then @xmath89 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in the multi - stream model , @xmath2 can usually cross zero .",
    "it is because @xmath21 may , say , larger than @xmath58 on some scales , than become smaller than @xmath58 on some other scales . as an example , when the deformation of the potential is `` symmetric '' , @xmath90 and the slow roll parameters satisfy @xmath91 . in the lowest order of slow roll approximation ,",
    "one have @xmath92 so in this example , @xmath2 must change sign at a certain scale .",
    "this special kind of running of the non - gaussianity is illustrated in fig.[ngrun ]     we illustrate the scalar power spectrum as a function of scale @xmath44 . the red ( dashed )",
    "line denotes the trajectory @xmath7 , and the blue ( dotted ) line denotes the trajectory @xmath8 .",
    "if a perturbation @xmath87 leads to path @xmath7 , then we have @xmath93 on larger length scales and @xmath89 on smaller length scales.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this section , we will give a summary of signatures for multi - stream inflation . as we have mentioned in section 2",
    ", @xmath86 appears as an additional power at scale @xmath9 in the cmb .",
    "this additional power can not be arbitrarily large , because otherwise it should have been observed in the experiments . to be in accordance with cmb experiments , we require this anomaly power to satisfy @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is determined by the error bar of cmb experiments , which varies when we choose @xmath9 to be different scales .",
    "usually , one needs some fine tunning to satisfy the above constraint . in this section",
    ", we also discuss this tuning issue in more detail .",
    "first of all , the amount of tuning depends on the detail of the potential , thus depends on the detail of string landscape .",
    "for example , if the trajectories @xmath7 and @xmath8 are completely symmetric , then there is no tuning at all .",
    "however , in this case , there are no new signatures for multi - stream inflation either .    to analyze the relation between tuning and signatures for multi - stream inflation further ,",
    "let us calculate the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath16 .",
    "we use the slow roll parameters @xmath96 we first investigate the parameter regime where @xmath97 is not too small . to be more explicit , @xmath91 , and with `` symmetric '' deformation of potential : @xmath98 with these assumptions",
    ", @xmath33 can be written as @xmath99 the integration in eq . can be expanded in powers of the slow roll parameters .",
    "so the natural value of @xmath33 is @xmath100 we find that @xmath33 is suppressed by slow roll parameters .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath101 .",
    "if for some reasons we have @xmath102 , then @xmath33 can be much smaller than given in eq . .    to summarize the experimental signatures for multi - stream inflation , we propose two inequalities to divide the parameter space of multi - stream inflation into four regions",
    "as discussed at the beginning of this section , current cmb experiments do not allow large features .",
    "a condition @xmath94 is needed for multi - stream inflation to be consistent with cmb observations .",
    "if the above inequality is nearly saturated , then cmb experiments in the near future can detect the cmb features at scale @xmath9 .",
    "another inequality comes from the comparison of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 . as shown in eqs . and",
    ", this comparison determines whether @xmath2 is larger or smaller than @xmath106 , thus detectable or not in the near future .",
    "there is no estimator as sharp as @xmath2 for the power asymmetry .",
    "so before explicitly fitting the multi - stream inflation model with cmb data , it is less clear how large power asymmetry can be detected in the next generation of experiments .",
    "however , one should note that the detection of @xmath2 in eq . indicates a difference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "so here , we take the existence of large non - gaussianity to be the condition for observable amount of power asymmetry .",
    "one should note that the detection of power asymmetry is in principle easier than the detection of @xmath2 , because the detection of power asymmetry does not need information for @xmath51 .",
    "we are glad to see whether improved methods can be proposed for detecting the power asymmetry .    using the above two inequalities ,",
    "the four parameter regions for multi - stream inflation are :    * when @xmath107 and @xmath108 , there is no observable signature for multi - stream inflation",
    ". there may be an isocurvature perturbation , which is different from single field inflation .",
    "however , this isocurvature perturbation can also arise in simpler two field models .",
    "* when @xmath109 and @xmath108 , there is one signature for multi - stream inflation : a feature in the scalar power spectrum at scale @xmath9 . such features in the scalar power spectrum may be responsible for the features in the wmap data . *",
    "when @xmath109 and @xmath110 , there are three signatures for multi - stream inflation : the first signature is as that in the above case : the feature in the spectrum at scale @xmath9 .",
    "the second signature is that there will be an asymmetry in the powers between @xmath55 in one patch of the sky of scale @xmath9 and another .",
    "this could be responsible for the hemispherical power asymmetry .",
    "the third prediction is non - gaussianity .",
    "the non - gaussianity is of order @xmath111 as discussed in the former section , @xmath2 in our multi - stream model is largest in the squeezed limit because @xmath112 , and @xmath2 usually crosses zero .",
    "+ now we estimate whether this case is natural or not .",
    "the natural value of @xmath33 can be estimated using eq .",
    ", @xmath113 in order that perturbation on the scale @xmath9 is not ruled out by experiments , we need @xmath114 .",
    "the amount of tuning for this parameter region is measured by @xmath115 for example , if we have multi - stream inflation for 3 e - folds , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 . to be more explicit ,",
    "there is one potential in 10 potentials that can produce @xmath119 , and one in 100 that can produce @xmath120 .",
    "assume that future experiments show @xmath119 , then 3 features in the scalar power spectrum can naturally achieve that .",
    "* when @xmath107 and @xmath121 , there is large non - gaussianity , asymmetry on powers in different patches of the sky , and no feature in the power spectrum",
    ". however , more fine tuning is needed for this possibility than the former one .",
    "there is potentially one more signature of multi - stream inflation : the correlation between the curvature perturbation and the isocurvature perturbation .",
    "however , as we need to go to detailed models to calculate this correlation , we shall not consider it in the present work .",
    "we hope to address this issue in the future .",
    "if @xmath97 is even smaller than @xmath122 and @xmath123 , then we are unable to perform the expansion in the slow roll parameters . in this case ,",
    "@xmath124 , and we need more fine tuning to get the desired non - gaussianity and anisotropy for perturbation powers for multi - stream inflation .",
    "to conclude , we have described the multi - stream inflation model , and calculated the density perturbation and non - gaussianity of the model .",
    "we find that the model can be parameterized by the @xmath103 and @xmath33 .",
    "we show that signatures such as non - gaussianity , features in the cmb and the hemispherical power asymmetry can be produced in corresponding parameter regions .",
    "we also note that isocurvature perturbation at @xmath5 and @xmath14 may produce interesting physics .",
    "we hope we can address these issues in some future work .",
    "we also hope to build more explicit models of multi - stream inflation , and investigate the signatures of multi - stream inflation in more detail in the future . finally , the perturbations are studied semi - quantitatively in this paper .",
    "it is important to calculate the perturbations more precisely and determine the @xmath106 coefficients .",
    "to do so , one needs to investigate the cosmic perturbation theory for a quantum state with two decohered branches .",
    "we also leave this calculation to future work .",
