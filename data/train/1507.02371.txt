    "synchronization in networks of neuronal systems has been an active research area due to its important role in coding and information processing in biological systems and brain .",
    "bursting neurons are characterized by alternates of activity of neurons between a quiescent state and fast repetitive spiking on a slow time scale .",
    "there are many processes to produce bursting behavior in coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "further , different types of synchrony occur in coupled bursting neurons which include spike synchronization , bursting synchronization , complete synchronization and anti - phase bursting synchronization @xcite . in general , burst synchronization occurs at lower values of coupling strength and for complete synchronization , which involves both spike and burst synchronizations , one requires a higher value of coupling strength .",
    "two different forms of couplings are mainly used in coupled bursting neurons depending on whether the synapse is chemical @xcite or electrical @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the synaptic coupling is often approximated by a static sigmoidal nonlinear input - output function with a threshold and saturation . in the second case ,",
    "the electrical coupling is a linear function and is directly dependent on the difference between the membrane potentials .",
    "complete synchronization always occurs in globally coupled bursting neurons under suitable conditions on the coupling strength when the synaptic coupling is electrical .",
    "using such a global synaptic coupling , identical oscillators are found to be either synchronized or oscillate incoherently , but they never exist simultaneously .",
    "interestingly , we observe the coexistence of coherent and disordered ( incoherent ) states under nonlocal , global as well as local ( nearest neighbor ) synaptic couplings in a network of bursting neurons . such a coexisting state was originally named as chimera state by abrams and strogatz @xcite in the context of nonlocally coupled phase oscillators .",
    "chimera states in identical coupled oscillators have also been an active area of extensive research in recent years in the field of biology , physics and social sciences @xcite .",
    "initially the chimera states have been shown to emerge when a network of identical oscillators are coupled nonlocally , that is the coupling strength decays with distance between the coupled oscillators .",
    "chimera states are interesting because they occur even when the oscillators are identical and coupled symmetrically .",
    "there are different types of chimera states such as amplitude - mediated @xcite , breathing @xcite , clustered @xcite , spiral - wave @xcite , etc",
    "chimera states have also been experimentally observed in chemical @xcite , electronic @xcite , electrochemical @xcite and mechanical @xcite systems .",
    "initially it was assumed that chimera states only exist in phase oscillators using non - local coupling configuration .",
    "but recently it has been observed that chimera states also occur in systems exhibiting limit cycles and in chaotic dynamical systems @xcite . very recently , chimera states have also been observed in globally coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "chimera states observed in real - world systems @xcite , where various dynamical behaviors are involved .",
    "for example , in the case of parkinson s disease due to lose or damage cells in the brain , synchronized activity is absent in certain regions of the brain @xcite . in the case of epileptic seizures , specific regions of the brain",
    "are highly synchronized and the others part are not synchronized @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging and inspiring problems in this area is to identify the existence of chimera states in neurobiological systems . during the last decade",
    "the mechanism behind mutual synchronization and phase synchronization of chaotic bursts in neural ensembles has been explained in detail @xcite .",
    "recently , kalitzin et al.@xcite have observed collective dynamics of coupled neuronal oscillators which have multiple oscillatory states . in this paper",

    "previously , chimera states were observed by sakaguchi @xcite in coupled hodgkin - huxley neural oscillators with excitatory and inhibitory couplings where nonlocal coupling is essential for the appearance of these states . very recently",
    ", omelchenko et al.@xcite have discussed the robustness of chimera states in nonlocally coupled fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators with respect to perturbations of the frequencies of the individual oscillators and the structural transformations of the network topology .",

    "as noted above , chimera states have been observed in hindmarsh - rose neurons with electric type of nonlocal coupling @xcite , where the range of coupling and coupling strength play key roles .",
    "but the existence of chimera state in hindmarsh - rose neurons with chemical synaptic coupling under local , global and nonlocal interactions has not been reported earlier . in our studies a chemical synaptic coupling is used which plays a key role in the emergence of chimera states in bursting neurons for locally and globally coupled neurons .",
    "we also analytically derive the condition for mutual synchronization in globally pulse - coupled network of bursting neurons . in the case of global and local ( nearest neighbor ) coupling , the behavior of the stability function in incoherent , chimera and multi - chimera states are also discussed . in our analysis we have used suitable statistical measures recently introduced by gopal et al .",

    "in fact , in the case of global coupling the stability function @xmath145 varies between zero and synaptic coupling strength @xmath24 for all @xmath14 . on the other hand for local coupling @xmath179 for all values of the membrane potential @xmath180 and , while it has an upper bound @xmath24 for @xmath181 @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath145 is negative and has a sharp drop near @xmath185 the neurons are in a multi - chimera state .",
    "the coherent and disordered neurons are in a plateau bursting state in fig .",
    "11(b ) which is in contrast to the chimera states studied earlier in the literature in chaotic systems , where the coherent states are in periodic states or remain close to steady states and disordered states are in chaotic states @xcite . but",
    "in a chimera or multi - chimera state in the present case all the coherent as well as the disordered neurons are in plateau bursting states .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the role of the chemical synaptic coupling function in inducing chimera and multi - chimera states of bursting neurons using non - local , global and local ( nearest neighbor ) interaction of neurons .",
    "surprisingly , we find that chimera or multi - chimera states occur even in the presence of local interaction alone whereas previous studies @xcite of chimera or multi - chimera states exist using either non - local or global interaction only .",
    "interestingly , we identified three types of chimera states using different types of coupling configurations . in the first type , in the case of non - local coupling , in chimera or multi - chimera states , coherent and disordered neurons are all of bursting type . in the second type",
    ", we find that in the chimera or multi - chimera state using global synaptic coupling both the groups , namely the coherent or disordered groups , are in a combination of square - wave and plateau bursting states .",
    "that is for some times they are square - wave bursting in nature and for other times they are in a plateau bursting state ( as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) or 4(c ) ) . in the third type of chimera state using local synaptic coupling , we identified that both the groups in chimera / multi - chimera states are in plateau bursting states ( fig .",
    "11(b ) ) . using suitable statistical measures disordered , multi - chimera , chimera or coherent states are confirmed .",
    "the existence of chimera and coherent states are also confirmed by using mean phase velocities @xcite . to conclude , we wish to point out that this work promises to identity the existence of chimera states in various types of coupling topologies in bursting cells",
    ". some types of chimera states might be helpful for information processing in the case of neurological diseases .",
    "existence of chimera states in two dimensional grid of oscillators is more realistic in neurobiology . in our manuscript",
    "we observed chimera state using nonlocal , global and local type of interactions . since interaction in two dimensional grid of oscillators are also of these types",
    ", we believe that chimera states can also emerge in these cases too .",
    "we are presently exploring this phenomenon and hope to report the results in the near future .",
    "finally , it will be also of interest to extend our work to identify chimera or multi - chimera states in other systems using nonlinear local coupling .",
    "moreover , the question of introducing time - delay in the nonlinear local coupling for the existence of chimera states @xcite is also an important task for future studies .",
