    "a breakthrough of grb observation , made by _ swift _ satellite in 2008 , is the discovery of the very bright burst grb 080319b which was accompanied by a naked - eye optical flash @xcite .",
    "the optical observation was going on even before the onset of the @xmath0-ray burst because tortora was monitoring the same region of the sky at that moment @xcite . the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _ swift _ satellite slewed to the source about @xmath3 sec after the trigger of the burst and recorded a quickly decaying but extremely bright x - ray component .",
    "these continuous observations collected fruitful data @xcite and rendered grb 080319b one of the best - studied bursts so far . although no very high - energy emission was directly detected from grb 080319b the unique spectrum of this burst and its afterglow suggest that it has been accompanied by a very strong gev - tev emission that would have already been detected by agile if not occulted by earth at that moment . based on a model",
    "in which the prompt optical and soft @xmath0-ray emission are respectively the synchrotron and the first order inverse compton ( ic ) radiation components of the internal shocks , kumar & panaitescu ( 2008 ) , racusin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and fan & piran ( 2008 ) suggested that the second order ic of the internal shocks would peak in gev - tev energy range and the isotropic energy might be high up to @xmath4 erg ( see however piran , sari & zou 2008 and fan , zhang & wei 2009 ) . because of the tight overlapping of the prompt emission with the reverse / forward shock regions , some soft @xmath0-rays will be up - scattered by the reverse shock electrons and some prompt optical photons will be up - scattered by the forward shock electrons , i.e. , the so - called external inverse compton ( eic ) . as a result , two additional gev - tev emission components with a duration @xmath5 s are expected ( fan & piran 2008 ) . in this work ,",
    "we discuss these possibilities in more detail .",
    "moreover , we show that the early ( @xmath6 s ) forward shock synchrotron and the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission in the energy range @xmath7 is as powerful as the high energy emission detected in grb 080916c @xcite . a schematic plot of the expected gev - tev signals from grb 080319b is shown in fig.[fig : sketch ] .        since its successful launch on june 11 2008",
    ", the fermi satellite has detected the prompt @xmath8 gev emission in grb 080916c @xcite , and the gev emission following a short burst grb 081024b @xcite .",
    "as grb 080514b @xcite , grb 080825c @xcite , and some other events detected by the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) satellite in 1991 - 2000 @xcite , the high energy emission of both grb 080916c and grb 081024b lasted longer than the prompt soft @xmath0-rays .",
    "the detection of high energy signals sheds some lights on the bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta , the radiation mechanisms , the physical composition of the outflow and the prolonged activity of the central engine .",
    "this is particularly the case if the simultaneous x - ray / optical emission data are available ( see fan & piran 2008 for a recent review ) . in this work",
    "we ll outline the origins of the gev emission from grb 080514b , grb 080916c and grb 081024b , based on the ( preliminary ) public data .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we calculate the possible prompt and afterglow gev - tev emission of grb 080319b . in section 3",
    ", we interpret the high energy emission detected in grb 080514b , grb 080916c and grb 081024b . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize our results with some discussions .",
    "grb 080319b @xcite was most notable due to its huge total energy and especially its extremely luminous prompt optical emission that could be seen with naked eyes @xcite . this burst was located at a redshift @xmath9 space @xcite and duration was @xmath1057s .",
    "the peak energy of the @xmath11 spectrum was @xmath12 kev , and the photon indexes below and above @xmath13 were @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . choosing standard cosmological parameters @xmath16(corresponding to a luminosity distance @xmath17 cm ) , we have a peak luminosity @xmath18 and an isotropic energy @xmath19 erg @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the optical v - band ( @xmath20hz ) light curve in the prompt phase ( from @xmath21 -10 s to @xmath21 100 s ) .",
    "variability was evident and there were at least 3 or 4 main pulses in the light curve .",
    "the peak v - band reached magnitude of 5.3 , corresponding to a flux density @xmath22 jy , and isotropic equivalent energy @xmath23erg if we take @xmath24 jy as the average flux density . the variability and the very sharp decline of the prompt optical emission support an internal origin of these optical photons , though the underlying physical process is not clear yet ( see * ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of various possible models ) .",
    "afterglow modeling can in principle constrain the total kinetic energy and the initial lorentz factor of the grb ejecta , and the physical parameters of the external shocks ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "the behavior of the afterglow of grb 080319b suggests a free wind medium @xcite .",
    "a self - consistent modeling of the x - ray and optical afterglow data favors a two - component jet model @xcite .",
    "moreover , the shock parameters of the narrow and wide ejecta components need to be very different , as found in grb 051221a @xcite . following @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we take the isotropic kinetic energy of the narrow ejecta ( represented by the subscript @xmath25 ) @xmath26 erg high up to @xmath27 erg is rather unusual .",
    "similar result has only been reported in the afterglow modeling of grb 060418 @xcite .",
    "however we believe that such a huge value is possible for grb 0980319b because the xrt flux at @xmath28 s is as bright as @xmath29 , which is the brightest x - ray afterglow detected so far and is even much brighter than most prompt x - ray emission of _ swift _ grbs .",
    "on the other hand both the spectral and the temporal behaviors of the early ( @xmath6 s ) x - ray emission strongly favor a fireball model in the slow cooling phase , which requires small @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as a result",

    "depending on the seed photons origins , ic can be ssc or eic .",
    "below we ll show that for grb 080319b both processes plausibly played an important role in producing gev@xmath2tev emission .",
    "this suggests that similar bursts will provide promising sources for the fermi high energy satellite .",
    "@xcite showed that the ssc models in which the soft @xmath0-rays are the ic component of the optical photons can not explain the observations .",
    "the major obstacle is the resulting high synchrotron self - absorption frequency and then the x - ray spectrum that is inconsistent with the observation .",
    "if we ignore this problem , there is a solution with a compton parameter @xmath49 and a stochastic lorentz factor @xmath50 .",
    "then the 2nd ic peaks at @xmath51 gev , and the number of the detectable photons is @xmath52 corresponding to detected @xmath53 photons by lat , with @xmath54 at gev energies . other models with larger @xmath55",
    "lead to even stronger signals @xcite .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "too much energy should be hidden either in the high energy component if using the ssc model , or in the low energy component of electrons if we assume the prompt optical emission and @xmath0-rays were from synchrotron emission by two components of electrons in the same region .",
    "it indicates that the two different bands of prompt photons should come from different geometrical regions .",
    "below we consider these two different regions ( possibly but not necessarily two sets of different internal shocks ) within the same outflow cone , denoted by the subscripts  @xmath56 \" and  @xmath0 \" respectively .",
    "strong high energy prompt emission is still possible , and it can be estimated even though the details of the internal shocks are still unclear .",
    "the possible high energy emission consists of four components : self - ic scattering in the optical emission region ; self - ic scattering in the @xmath0-ray producing region ; optical photons ic scattered in the @xmath0-ray producing region ; and soft @xmath0-rays ic scattered in the optical emission region .",
    "note that because of the steep decline of the high energy slope ( @xmath57 ) extrapolation of the soft @xmath0-ray emission gives only a very weak signal .",
    "the observed optical flux density limits the temperature of this region ( see the appendix for the derivation ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath60 is boltzmann constant , @xmath61 is the temperature ( while the minimal temperature @xmath62 corresponds to the equality ) , and @xmath63 is the emission region radius . thus @xmath64 noticing that the bulk lorentz factor in the afterglow is high @xcite , we take a fiducial value of @xmath65 for the prompt phase .",
    "considering the variability of the light curves and the deceleration radius , which constrains the radius should not be too large , then the choice @xmath66 cm is reasonable .",
    "the corresponding typical stochastic lorentz factor of the electrons is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the rest mass of the electron .",
    "the first order ic is in the soft @xmath0-ray band . as mentioned before the prompt soft @xmath0-rays are unlikely to be the first order ic component of the optical emission .",
    "so the first order ic radiation of the electrons emitting optical photons would be much smaller than the detected soft @xmath0-rays . correspondingly , the 2nd order ic radiation in gev - tev energy range is unimportant as it falls below the ic radiation that arises when the prompt soft @xmath0-rays cross the optical emission region .",
    "if the soft @xmath0-rays pass through the prompt optical emitting electrons , the  optical depth \" for electrons is approximately @xmath69 where @xmath70s is the typical variability timescale of the prompt optical emission . for each collision",

    "the total energy of the avalanche loaded pairs is in the order of @xmath98 even all the first produced very high energy photons are cooled into steady pairs .",

    "it is thus undetectable even without taking into account the large optical depth ( @xmath100 ) of the universe to such energetic photons ( stecker et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "if the optical photons are produced in smaller radii than the soft @xmath0-rays ( @xmath101 ) , they would be ic scattered in the @xmath0-rays region .",
    "in this case , the electrons will be cooled to a random lorentz factor @xmath102 @xcite , where @xmath103 is the luminosity of the prompt optical emission , suggesting that all the electrons were cooled by the ic scattering .",

    "_ this discussion is valid only for @xmath107 that is less likely_. as long as @xmath108 , the prompt optical emission can not cool the accelerated electrons emitting soft @xmath75rays , because the photons from @xmath109 reached @xmath110 in a time @xmath111 when the photons at @xmath110 had been disappeared long before .",
    "for the same reason , there would be no high energy photons produced by the optical region electrons as presented in section [ sec : gamma - opt ] ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) if @xmath113 .      whatever the mechanism is , the prompt emission should have an internal origin , in view of the high variability of the light curves and the very sharp decline at @xmath114 .",
    "external reverse - forward shock formed very quickly .",

    "the main advantage of this model is that the duration of the high energy emission is longer than that of the prompt soft @xmath0-ray emission by a factor of 2 , consistent with the observation .",
    "there are also 2 high energy photons detected at @xmath197 s. they may be the synchrotron or ssc emission of the forward shock .",
    "the possibility that they are the ssc emission of an underlying x - ray flare ( wei , yan & fan 2006 ; wang , li & mszros 2006 ; galli & guetta 2008 ; fan et al .",
    "2008 ) can not be ruled out .",
    "the lack of the simultaneous xrt observation makes it difficult to draw further conclusion . + _",
    "grb 080916c _ was a long burst with a duration @xmath198s . the time averaged spectrum , from 8 kev up to 30 mev , of the main emission is best fitted by a band function with @xmath199kev , @xmath200 , and @xmath201",
    "the fluence ( 8 kev @xmath2 30 mev ) is @xmath202 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* swift ) .",
    "more than 10 photons are observed above 1 gev during the prompt phase @xcite and the high energy emission lasted longer than the soft @xmath75rays @xcite .",
    "this was a very bright burst with a hard spectrum .",
    "a simple extension of the kev@xmath2mev spectrum to higher energy range gives @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 by lat ( on - axis case ) , enough to match the observation @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the synchrotron radiation of the internal shocks plays an important role in producing high energy prompt emission .",
    "the redshift of grb 080916c is estimated to be @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "the peak luminosity is thus as high as @xmath207 .",
    "the typical variability timescale is suggested to be as long as @xmath208 s @xcite . with these information",
    ", the detection of @xmath8 gev prompt emission gives a tight constraint on the initial bulk lorentz factor of the grb outflow , i.e. ( lithiwick & sari 2001 ; fan & piran 2008 ; gupta & zhang 2008 ) , @xmath209 using the maximal synchrotron radiation frequency of the shocks @xmath210 @xcite , we find that if the high energy emission up to @xmath100 gev is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of internal shocks , the initial lorentz factor should satisfy : @xmath211 a @xmath44 much higher than @xmath212 is unlikely .",
    "so this strongly suggests that the internal shocks can accelerate high energy particles ( both protons and electrons ) very efficiently and the highest energy of electrons is limited by the loss via synchrotron radiation .",
    "the energy distribution index of the shock - accelerated electrons ( @xmath213 ) is also close to that predicted in the theory .",
    "this is a very encouraging news for the people interested in the ultra - high energy particle acceleration in grbs .",
    "however , we d like to caution that it is the only case among the 70 events observed so far by fermi @xcite",
    ". it might be too early to say more at this moment .",
    "the internal shock synchrotron radiation can not account for the delayed high energy emission @xcite .",
    "the possible mechanisms that can produce this emission are ( i ) the eic emission from the reverse - forward shock regions , ( ii ) the ssc emission of the forward shock and ( iii ) ssc emission of the weak internal shocks powering an extended x - ray emission component that is below the threshold of gbm .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath214 mev emission in the time interval @xmath215 sec is @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "such a soft spectrum imposes a tight constraint on the models . in the standard afterglow model , the late time infrared and x - ray afterglow @xcite",

    "an @xmath33 is needed to have a cooling frequency above the xrt energy range at @xmath217 day ( gao et al .",

    ", the ssc emission can peak at an energy @xmath223 $ ] mev ( see section 5.1 of * ? ? ? * for details ) . in this case",
    ", the electron energy distribution index is irrelevant to that of the afterglow electrons and can be as large as @xmath224 , as found in the spectrum analysis of x - ray flares @xcite . as a result",
    ", the soft spectrum of the delayed @xmath194 mev emission may be interpreted .",
    "+ _ grb 081024b _ was a short burst with a duration @xmath225s @xcite .",
    "the lat saw the emission from this source up to 3 gev , in the first 5 seconds after the trigger .",
    "here we consider two possible interpretations .",
    "one is that the delayed emission is the ssc component of an extended / prompt soft x - ray emission .",
    "following fan & piran ( 2008 ; see their eqs.(47 - 49 ) ) , the typical frequency of the internal shock ssc emission can be estimated as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the radius of the continued but weak internal shocks that power the underlying prompt x - ray emission with a luminosity @xmath228 , and @xmath229 is the ssc parameter of the internal shocks .",
    "this model requires a unmagnetized outflow launched by the continued activity of the central engine , in contradiction with most models proposed so far ( see zhang 2006 for a review ) .",
    "if confirmed , a stringent constraint on the nature of the extended emission following short grbs will be established .",
    "so , in principle , the cooperation of _ swift _ and fermi satellite can reveal the nature of the late outflow powering the extended emission .",
    "the other possible origin of the delayed high energy emission is the ssc emission of the forward shock .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the outflow with an initial lorentz factor @xmath230 gets decelerated in the interstellar medium with a number density @xmath231 in @xmath232 sec .",
    "the typical ssc emission frequency of the forward shock can be estimated as @xcite @xmath233 ^ 4e_{\\rm k,51}^{3/4}t_{1}^{-9/4}.\\ ] ] one may be able to distinguish between the above two scenarios by analyzing the spectrum . if the delayed high energy emission is the ssc component of extended but weak internal shocks , the @xmath234 gev spectrum is expected to be steeper than @xmath235 .",
    "if the delayed high energy emission is the ssc component of external forward shock , the @xmath234 gev spectrum is expected to be @xmath236 unless @xmath237 .",
    "the forward shock synchrotron radiation can also give rise to gev emission .",
    "it is , however , difficult to say more concerning this possibility because the early afterglow physics of short grbs is still poorly understood .",

    "motivated by this , we calculate the possible high - energy prompt / afterglow emission in grb 080319b that was distinguished by a naked - eye optical flash and by an unusual strong early x - ray afterglow .",
    "two possible gev - tev emission components may be related to the naked - eye optical flash .",
    "the first is the inverse compton scattering of the prompt optical photons by electrons producing the soft @xmath0-rays .",
    "the second is the very early eic emission from the forward shock region when the prompt optical emission overlaps the shock front .",
    "the difference is their duration .",
    "the former is expected to be simultaneous with the prompt soft @xmath0-ray emission while the latter lasts longer ( see fig.[fig : eic ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of the forward shock can give rise to a significant detection , too ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : con ] for a summary ) .",
    "this component may be more common than the two that depend on a strong optical flash as which is quite rare .",
    "the detection prospect of the forward shock synchrotron radiation by lat is fairly good .",
    "for the _ swift _ grbs detected so far , grbs 060105 , 061007 , 070419b and 080721 have a @xmath245 kev flux @xmath246 at @xmath247 s after the trigger ( http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt@xmath248curves/ ; evans et al . 2007 ) . though about one order of magnitude lower than that of grb 080319b , they are strong enough to produce a gev synchrotron emission detectable by lat as long as the synchrotron spectrum can indeed extend to an energy @xmath249",
    ". the forward shock ssc emission of these very bright events may be more suitable for the ground - based cherenkov telescopes , like magic or h.e.s.s .    in section 3",
    ", we discussed the possible physical origin of the high energy emission of grb 080514b , grb 080916c and grb 081024b .",
    "we find that these detections can be generally understood by the synchrotron and inverse compton radiation of the internal shocks or external shocks .",
    "for example , the delayed sub - gev flash detected in grb 080514b may be the eic emission from the reverse shock region and the prompt gev - emission of grb 080916c may be dominated by the synchrotron radiation of the internal shocks .",
    "the  long lasting \" high energy emission detection in the short burst grb 081024b may be attributed to the ssc emission of the decelerated forward shock or the internal shocks powering an extended x - ray component which is below the threshold of gbm . however , as lack of detailed observations , it is defficult to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "finally we focus on the common feature that the high energy emission usually lasts longer than the prompt soft @xmath0-rays , as detected in grb 080514b , grb 080916c and grb 081024b .",
    "such a phenomena , peculiar in pre - afterglow era , may be explained as : ( 1 ) the synchrotron and the ssc emission of the long lasting forward external shock can contribute to the high energy emission significantly .",
    "( 2 ) the grb central engines usually do not turn off abruptly .",
    "the ssc emission of the continued but weak internal shocks may peak at gev energies .",
    "( 3 ) if a ( mildly ) relativistic reverse shock formed , the prompt optical / x - ray/@xmath0-ray photons overlap the external shock fronts tightly and cool the accelerated electrons effectively .",
    "this process will produce a gev emission component with a duration about twice that of the prompt photons . for a sub - relativistic reverse shock ,",
    "the prompt soft @xmath0-ray photons exceed the external shock fronts quickly . its effect on cooling the reverse / forward",
    "shock electrons can be ignored .",
    "however in such a case the electrons / protons accelerated in reverse shock contain just @xmath250 of the total energy of the grb ejecta @xcite and can not play an important role in producing high energy emission .",
    "( 4 ) the eic in the late afterglow phase caused by x - ray flares can also give rise to gev emission .",
    "however the luminosity is lowered since its duration has been significantly extended .",
    "usually lat is unable to catch such a weak signal .",
