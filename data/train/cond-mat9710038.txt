    "<S> we show that the typical electron states with energies lying deep inside the pseudogap are localized near large disorder fluctuations ( instantons ) , which have the form of a soliton - antisoliton pair . using the `` saddle - point '' method we obtain the average density of states and the average optical absorption coefficient at small energy .    </S>",

    "<S> etc_.@xcite while in a perfect peierls chain the single - electron spectrum has a gap , with a value related to the amplitude of the periodic chain distortion , in a disordered chain the gap is filled . at weak disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the density of disorder - induced states that occur inside the gap is small , leading to a pseudogap , while at large disorder the gap disappears entirely and in the middle of the band the density may even diverge.@xcite    in this letter , we find the typical form of the disorder - induced electron states lying close to the center of the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to giving new insight into these disordered systems , this result is useful , as it allows for a relatively easy calculation of disorder averages . as examples , we will explicitly calculate the average density of states and the average absorption coefficient at small energies .    </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial for our approach , that a large disorder fluctuation is required to create an electron state close to the center of the pseudogap , implying that the probability for such a state to occur is small at weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the density of states at small energy then comes from the disorder realizations close to one most probable fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> the form of this fluctuation can be found consistently with the form of the wave function of the electron state induced inside the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> this wave function turns out to be localized in the vicinity of the disorder fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation is encountered when calculating the density of states of electrons moving in a random potential at large negative energies.@xcite these states were found to be localized in regions where the disorder potential has the form of a deep well .    </S>",
    "<S> the approximate calculation of disorder averages , valid when the dominant contribution comes from a small part of all possible disorder realizations , is closely related to the semiclassical approximation in quantum mechanics and field theory . in the path integral version of this approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the paths giving the largest contribution to the green function lie close to the `` saddle - point '' of the euclidean action , called the instanton.@xcite    to describe the disordered peierls chain we use the fluctuating gap model ( fgm).@xcite it has previously been considered in the context of the thermodynamical properties of quasi - one - dimensional organic compounds ( nmp - tcnq , ttf - tcnq),@xcite and has been applied to study the effect of disorder on the peierls transition,@xcite as well as the effect of quantum lattice fluctuations on the optical spectrum of peierls materials . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the electron motion is described by the one - dimensional dirac equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the pauli matrices and @xmath4 is the wave function of the single - electron state close to the fermi energy @xmath5 . the first term in the hamiltonian @xmath6 describes the free motion of the electrons and the two amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to particles moving , respectively , to the right and to the left with the fermi velocity @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in the hamiltonian describes the backward scattering of electrons from the lattice distortion wave , whose amplitude is proportional to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> disorder is modelled by assuming @xmath10 to fluctuate randomly along the chain around some average value @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fluctuating part with a gaussian correlator , @xmath14    in the absence of disorder ( @xmath15 ) , the electron spectrum has a gap between the energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 . at nonzero disorder </S>",
    "<S> the average density of states lying close to the middle of the pseudogap ( @xmath18 ) was found in ref . by means of the `` phase formalism'',@xcite @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that due to the charge conjugation symmetry ( particle - hole symmetry ) of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath6 , the density of states is a symmetric function of the energy @xmath20 , and in what follows we will assume @xmath21 to be positive .    from eq.([dos ] ) it is clear that at weak disorder ( @xmath22 ) the density of states close to the middle of the pseudogap is strongly suppressed . as we mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the explanation for this is that a large fluctuation of @xmath10 is required in order to create an electron state with energy @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to apply the `` saddle - point '' approach to study the typical electron states and to calculate disorder averages . </S>",
    "<S> the `` saddle - point''disorder fluctuation ( or instanton ) @xmath24 is the least suppressed one among the required large fluctuations . it can be found by minimizing , @xmath25 = \\frac{1}{2a } \\int\\!\\ !   </S>",

    "<S> . the spectrum of electron states that occur for this @xmath10 has previously been considered@xcite in relation with polarons in the su - schrieffer - heeger model of conjugated polymers,@xcite and is depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it consists of a valence band ( with highest energy @xmath40 ) , a conduction band ( with lowest energy @xmath41 ) , and two localized intragap states with energies @xmath42 , where @xmath43 thus , the soliton - antisoliton separation @xmath36 is fixed by the condition @xmath44 . </S>",

    "<S> the suppression factor eq.([action ] ) , @xmath51 \\approx \\frac{1}{2a } ( 2 \\delta_0)^2 r \\approx \\frac{2}{g } \\ln \\frac{2 \\delta_0}{\\varepsilon}\\;\\;,\\ ] ] also depends logarithmically on energy , so that the weight of the saddle - point configuration is , @xmath52 \\propto \\varepsilon^{\\frac{2}{g}}\\;.\\ ] ] this result already gives a good estimate for the shape of the density of states inside the pseudogap at @xmath22 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([dos ] ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed calculation requires performing the gaussian integration over the disorder realizations close to the `` saddle - point '' configuration eq.([soan ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then find the following expression for the average density of electron states per unit length , @xmath53 for @xmath22 , this agrees with eq.(36 ) of ref . </S>",
    "<S> , confirming the validity of the `` saddle - point '' approximation at small energies and weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the easiest way to get the result eq.([ansdos ] ) is to use the correspondence between the averaging over disorder realizations @xmath13 and the quantum - mechanical averaging over the ground state for a certain double - well potential . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the calculation will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> having obtained the form of the most probable disorder - induced electron states , we can now also calculate in a relatively straightforward way the optical absorption coefficient for a half - filled chain at photon energy @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> again , only a large disorder fluctuation can make the energy difference between the empty and filled electron levels small . with the highest probability the photon absorption will induce a transition from the highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied electron state . due to the particle - hole symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the energy of the lowest unoccupied state at half - filling should equal @xmath56 , while the energy of the highest doubly occupied state should equal @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the `` saddle - point '' disorder configuration , whose probability largely determines the absorption rate , is given by eqs.([soan ] ) , ( [ vfk ] ) , and ( [ eps ] ) with @xmath58 .    thus , in the `` saddle - point '' approximation , the absorption coefficient is the product of the averaged density of states ( which is essentially the probability to find the necessary disorder fluctuation ) and the strength of the optical transition between the two intragap levels : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the electric dipole operator , @xmath61 denote the wave functions of the intragap states ( with energies @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 is an @xmath64-independent coefficient ( for small @xmath64 , we can neglect the weak @xmath64-dependence of the real part of the dielectric constant ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions of the intragap states @xmath61 are the bonding and antibonding superpositions of the wave functions of the midgap states localized near the soliton and the antisoliton ( see eq.([psi ] ) ) , from which the transition dipole matrix element is obtained as , @xmath65 here @xmath66 denotes the electron charge and @xmath36 is the soliton - antisoliton separation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the asymptotic behavior of the averaged absorption coefficient at low photon energy we obtain , @xmath67    at this point we want to comment on the calculations of the optical conductivity in refs . and , in which the factorization approximation , @xmath68 , was used to evaluate the disorder average of the product of two green functions . from above , it is clear that this approximation is not valid at low photon energies , as it results in the optical conductivity ( as well as the absorption coefficient ) being proportional to the second power of the weight eq.([weight ] ) , rather than the first ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([abs ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , at weak disorder the absorption at photon energies @xmath54 is small anyhow , but the factorization approximation makes it even much smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> we would also like to point out that the small difference between the energies of the bonding and antibonding states is potentially dangerous for the saddle - point calculation of both the average optical absorption coefficient and density of states . </S>",
    "<S> the problem arises in the calculation of the contribution of the disorder realizations close to the `` saddle - point '' fluctuation : @xmath69 the perturbation @xmath70 can , in principle , strongly mix the bonding and antibonding states , because of the small energy denominator @xmath47 appearing in the perturbation series . </S>",
    "<S> such mixing would affect the values of both the energy splitting between the two states and the dipole matrix element . to see if that is the case , we considered the effective perturbation hamiltonian , acting on the subspace of the two bonding and antibonding states , which includes the virtual excitations to all other ( high - energy ) electron states . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the off - diagonal matrix elements of this hamiltonian are @xmath71 , which cancels @xmath21 in the denominator and makes the mixing of the two states small . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a direct consequence of the charge conjugation symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian eq.([dirac ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , despite the small energy splitting , the saddle - point method is applicable .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in the fgm the most probable form of the wave function of the electron state lying deep within the pseudogap contains two peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the `` saddle - point '' disorder fluctuation , which induces such a state , has the form of a soliton - antisoliton pair and the peaks of the wave function are localized near the two kinks of this fluctuation ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> away from the kinks , the electron wave function eq.([psi ] ) falls off exponentially on a length scale @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is consistent with the fact , that the localization length at zero energy , @xmath73 calculated using the thouless formula,@xcite at weak disorder equals the correlation length @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> as we demonstrated , the instanton approach allows for a relatively easy calculation of the small - energy density of states and absorption coefficient .    </S>",
    "<S> our results ( eqs.([ansdos ] ) and eq.([absorp ] ) ) are valid if the density of the disorder - induced states is small , which is the case when @xmath74 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful , however , to comment briefly on effects of large disorder . for @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> the typical size of the disorder fluctuation @xmath13 on a scale of the correlation length @xmath72 becomes comparable to @xmath11 , so that disorder fluctuations inducing the electron states with small energy are no longer suppressed , and for @xmath76 the density of states even diverges at @xmath77.@xcite this is essentially the singularity found long ago by dyson@xcite for a gapless system , because at strong disorder there is no principal difference between the electron states in peierls insulators and conducting ( @xmath78 ) chains . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the localization length of the electron states diverges as @xmath79 and the wave functions have an irregular structure , being large in many separated chain regions.@xcite surprisingly , the `` saddle - point '' method gives the correct exponent @xmath80 ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> eq.([ansdos ] ) ) for the energy dependence of the average density of states at _ all _ values of @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests , that even at large @xmath81 the typical form of the wave function may be close to the one given by eq.([psi ] ) in the regions where the wave function is large , and that multi - instanton disorder configurations ( a gas of the soliton - antisoliton pairs ) may become important at strong disorder .    </S>",
