    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are effective laboratories for studying stellar evolution and stellar dynamics .",
    "they are ancient building blocks of galaxies , and can help us to understand the formation and evolution of their parent galaxies .",
    "in addition , gcs exhibit surprisingly uniform properties , suggesting a common formation mechanism .",
    "the density distributions of most of them are well fitted by empirical models of @xcite .",
    "the closest other populous gc system beyond the halo of our galaxy is that of m31 .",
    "the andromeda galaxy is the ideal nearby target for studying gcs , since it contains more gcs than all other local group galaxies combined @xcite .",
    "the brightest gcs in m31 are more luminous than @xmath7 centauri , which is the most luminous galactic gc . among these giants",
    "is mayall ii = g1 ( hereafter referred to as g1 for reasons of brevity ) , which was first identified as a gc candidate ( `` mayall ii '' ) by @xcite using a palomar 48-inch schmidt plate taken in 1948 .",
    "it was subsequently named g1 by @xcite in their survey with the kitt peak 4-m mayall telescope of gcs in 29 fields surrounding m31 .",
    "it is located in the halo of m31 , at a projected distance of about 40 kpc from the galaxy s nucleus ( see meylan et al .",
    "this cluster has been studied in detail by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who found that it is quite flattened , with @xmath8 .",
    "g1 is also of interest because it may contain a central intermediate - mass ( @xmath9 m@xmath10 ) black hole @xcite . @xcite",
    "have pointed out that g1 is , following @xmath7 centauri , only the second gc in which convincing evidence for a real abundance dispersion has been seen ( although m22 and m54 are also two good candidates for a metallicity spread ; see for reviews of sarajedini & layden 1995 ; da costa & armandroff 1995 ; monaco et al .",
    "it has therefore been considered as the possible remnant core of a dwarf galaxy which lost most of its envelope through tidal interactions with m31 @xcite .",
    "subsequently @xcite strengthened the @xcite and @xcite conclusion .",
    "@xcite used the image obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "( in fact , it is the very same image used in this paper ) to construct a radial profile of g1 , which was fitted by a non - parametric , spherical , isotropic model to examine whether or not g1 contains a central massive black hole . by deconvolving this better spatial resolution image",
    ", @xcite found a bright star near the centre of g1 , which could not be detected in previous poorer resolution _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images .",
    "therefore , the structural parameters of g1 obtained based on this better spatial resolution image will certainly affect previous results based on the poorer resolution _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 image .",
    "this is one of the key contributions of the present paper .    in this paper , we redetermine the structural parameters of g1 using a deep _ hst_/acs image .",
    "this is at the highest resolution yet with which this cluster has been observed ; it allows us to both probe the cluster s structure to smaller radii than ever before and obtain the most accurate surface brightness profile at large radii to date .",
    "we searched the _ hst _ archive and found g1 to have been observed with the acs / high resolution channel ( hrc ) in the f555w band ( equivalent to the johnson @xmath11 filter ) on 2003 october 24 , as part of programme go-9767 ( pi gebhardt ) .",
    "the total integration time was 41 minutes over six exposures at three positions . upon retrieval from the stsci archive ,",
    "all images were processed by the standard acs calibration pipeline , in which bias and dark subtractions , flatfield division , and the masking of known bad pixels are included .",
    "subsequently , photometric header keywords are populated . in the final stage of the pipeline ,",
    "the multidrizzle software is used to correct the geometric distortion present in the hrc images .",
    "finally , any cosmic rays are rejected while individual images are combined into a final single image with an exposure time of 2460s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the products obtained from the stsci archive are calibrated drizzled images , in units of counts per second .",
    "we checked the images , and did not find saturated cluster stars .    during on -",
    "orbit operations , _ hst _ ccd instruments are subject to radiation damage that degrades their ability to transfer charges .",
    "charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) degradation can lead to photometric inaccuracy ( see detailed discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this paper , we did not correct for cte for the following reasons : ( i ) in the image used in this paper , charge excesses streaming from the stellar point sources ( equivalent to the effects of bleeding , although at a much lower flux level ) are not detected , i.e. , corrections for cte are not significant ; ( ii ) as @xcite pointed out , monitoring cte degradation is fairly easy , but the calculation of a correction formula is more difficult . in fact , until now , only @xcite and @xcite provided correction formulae to correct photometric losses as a function of a source s position , flux , background , time , and aperture size on the acs wfc ccds .",
    "@xcite did not correct for cte effects either in their analysis of the same image used in this paper .",
    "the acs / hrc spatial resolution is @xmath12 pixel@xmath13 .",
    "this high resolution makes two bright foreground stars appear far away from the cluster , and hence is helpful to obtain accurate photometry of the cluster .",
    "we used the iraf task ellipse to fit the image with a series of elliptical annuli from the centre to the outskirts , with the length of the semi - major axis increasing in steps of 8% .",
    "the centre coordinates of the isophotes were fixed . for our photometry , we derived the background value as the mean of a region of @xmath14 in the lower left - hand corner of the image , the centre of which was taken 779 pixels away from the cluster centre , and masked three areas , which were found to be disturbed by three foreground stars .",
    "we checked the image carefully , and did not find other obvious foreground stars .",
    "there are no obvious background galaxies , judging from the brightnesses and extent of the objects in the field of view .",
    "we performed the photometric calibration using the results of @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are derived in the acs / hrc vegamag system .",
    "the relevant zero - point for this system is 25.255 in f555w magnitudes @xcite .",
    "table 1 gives the ellipticity , @xmath15 , and the position angle ( p.a . ) as a function of the semi - major axis length , @xmath16 , from the centre of annulus .",
    "position angles are measured anti - clockwise from the vertical axis in fig .",
    "these observables have also been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; the errors were generated by the iraf task ellipse , in which the ellipticity errors are obtained from the internal errors in the harmonic fit , after removal of the first and second fitted harmonics . beyond @xmath17 arcsec , the ellipticity and position angle",
    "could not be obtained unambiguously , i.e. the fits did not converge because of the low signal - to - noise ratio at those large radii .",
    "the mean ellipticity is @xmath18 , which is in good agreement with the @xmath19 of @xcite .",
    "the ellipticity varies significantly as a function of the cluster s semi - major axis , from a minimum of @xmath20 at @xmath21 to a maximum @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "this is , to within the observational uncertainties , similar to the results of @xcite , whose data points are also included in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a direct comparison ( open circles ) .",
    "it is clear that while the general trend of the cluster s ellipticity as a function of semimajor axis radius is similar between the _ hst_/wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2)-based data of @xcite , the improved spatial resolution of our new _ hst_/acs data allows us to probe this trend deeper into the cluster core .",
    "[ fig2 ] clearly shows that in the inner parts ( @xmath24 ) the ellipticity increases towards smaller semimajor axis radii .",
    "this figure also shows that uncertainties in the exact value of the p.a .",
    "are only of secondary importance for the general trend in ellipticity observed , given that the p.a .",
    "determination between @xcite and the present paper differs by @xmath25 degrees .",
    "there are a number of possible reasons for the offsets in p.a . observed between these two studies , including those related to the accuracy of the centring of our isophotes ( which is linked to the different pixel sizes ) , and the steps in semimajor axis radius adopted , among others .",
    "it is of interest to note that the high ellipticity of g1 supports the empirical rule of @xcite that the brightest gcs in a galaxy are also usually the most flattened ones .",
    "the most luminous gc in m31 , 037-b327 , also has a high ellipticity , of @xmath26 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the vast majority of m31 gcs have ellipticities close to a median @xmath27 ( e.g. , lupton 1989 ; donofrio et al .",
    "1994 ; staneva et al . 1996 ; barmby et al . 2002 ) , although some of the faintest m31 gcs show significant flattening as well @xcite . the p.a . of the major axis",
    "is not significantly variable for semi - major axis values @xmath28 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however , just as for the ellipticity , the p.a",
    ". also increases towards smaller semimajor axis radii for @xmath29 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     however , a weakness of this argument is that dark matter that once may have surrounded gcs might have been stripped from them by tidal interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , ( ii ) individual stars in gcs ( with the notable exceptions of @xmath7 centauri , * m54 * and possibly m22 in the galaxy and g1 in m31 ) all have similar metallicities , whereas individual stars in dsphs exhibit a wide range in [ fe / h ] values . finally , @xcite noted that the [ @xmath30 and light r - process element ratios in most gcs mimic those in stars of similar metallicity in the galactic field , and differ from those in dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus , the apparent dichotomy in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plane shown in fig . [ fig4 ] might well be a distinction in dark matter content and approximate coevality of the stellar content of these objects .",
    "this view is supported by the observation that while the vast majority of galactic and magellanic cloud gcs are very nearly coeval , there are indeed clear metallicity spreads in the objects lying above the dividing line .",
    "it has also been claimed @xcite that the very old and metal - rich open cluster ngc 6791 might be the remnant core of a dsph galaxy as well .",
    "however , arguments against this hypothesis include , ( i ) with @xmath31 = 0.39\\pm0.05 $ ] , ngc 6791 would be much more metal - rich than any other nearby putative stripped dwarf galaxy core , ( ii ) the small number of cluster stars for which metallicities have thus far been determined do not exhibit a significant metallicity spread . in this respect , this object would therefore differ from @xmath7 centauri and a number of dsph companions to the galaxy .",
    "finally , ( iii ) it has been suggested by van den bergh ( 2000 , pp .",
    "54 - 55 , and references therein ) that ngc 6791 was originally a cluster in the metal - rich galactic bulge that was ejected into the disc by tidal interactions with the massive bar believed to be located within the galactic bulge",
    ". further support for this suggestion has recently been provided by means of accurate , high spatial resolution proper motion measurements based on multi - epoch _",
    "hst_/acs imaging ( bedin et al . 2006 ) .",
    "some light might be shed on this question if the values of @xmath5 and @xmath32 were available for ngc 6791 .",
    "this might allow one to see if ngc 6791 falls above , or below the line in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plane defined by eq .",
    "in summary it is concluded that the sample of objects that can be reliably placed in the @xmath5 vs @xmath6 diagram is still too small to decide whether this plane is normally occupied by a continuum of objects , or if unusual conditions such as `` tidal thrashing '' are required to fill some regions of this plane . in this connection",
    "we note that the four ultracompact dwarfs ( ucds ) in the fornax cluster @xcite for which @xmath5 and @xmath32 values are available ( all of which are located within @xmath33 kpc of ngc 1399 ) , lie in a compact grouping near @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , this places these objects near the centre of the apparent `` zone of avoidance '' between the local group dsphs and the putative stripped cores of dwarf galaxies , which extends up to @xmath36  dex above the line defined by eq .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found three objects in the core of the virgo cluster near m87 that lie between the regions in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 diagram that are usually occupied by normal dsphs and gc - like objects that are thought to be the stripped cores of such dsphs .    finally , as has been pointed out by @xcite",
    ", it is also puzzling that there appears to be a systematic difference between the locations of galactic and andromeda dsphs in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plane .",
    "in this paper , we redetermined the structural parameters of mayall ii = g1 based on an f555w image obtained with the advanced camera for surveys on the _ hst _ , by performing a fit to the surface brightness distribution of a single - mass isotropic king model .",
    "this allowed us to probe to smaller radii than ever before , thanks to the significantly higher spatial resolution offered by our instrumental set - up compared to that used by previous authors .",
    "we derive a core radius , @xmath0 , a tidal radius , @xmath37 , and a concentration index @xmath2 .",
    "the central surface brightness is 13.510 mag arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "we calculate the half - light radius , at @xmath4 .",
    "the results show that , within 10 core radii , a @xcite model fits the surface brightness distribution well , although a single - mass king model can not fit the observed profile at the outer regions well .",
    "the reason for this may be that for g1 , which has been considered as the possible remnant core of a former dwarf elliptical galaxy , it is impossible to model the complicated stellar and dynamical properties based on simple theories for gcs , such as king models .",
    "this applies in particular to the outer regions , where there exist strong tidal force due to the host galaxy .",
    "we also discussed the variation of ellipticity and position angle , and of surface brightness for the core of the object , in relation to previous measurements .",
    "we find that g1 falls in the same region of the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plane as @xmath7 centauri , m54 and ngc 2419 in the galaxy .",
    "all three of these objects have been claimed to be the stripped cores of now defunct dwarf galaxies .",
    "we discussed in detail whether gcs , nucleated dsph cores and normal dwarf galaxies form a continuous distribution in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plane , or if gcs and dsphs constitute distinct classes of objects ; we have presented arguments in favour of this latter option .",
