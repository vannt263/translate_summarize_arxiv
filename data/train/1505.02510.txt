    "the vandermonde decomposition is a classical result by carathodory and fejr dating back to 1911 @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is an @xmath2 positive semidefinite ( psd ) toeplitz matrix of rank @xmath3 .",
    "the result states that @xmath1 can be uniquely decomposed as where @xmath4 is an @xmath5 positive definite diagonal matrix and @xmath6 is an @xmath7 vandermonde matrix whose columns correspond to uniformly sampled complex sinusoids with different frequencies .",
    "the result became important in the area of data analysis and signal processing when it was rediscovered by pisarenko and used for frequency retrieval from the data covariance matrix @xcite . from then on , the vandermonde decomposition , also referred to as the carathodory - fejr - pisarenko decomposition , has formed the basis of a prominent subset of methods designated as subspace methods , e.g. , multiple signal classification ( music ) and estimation of parameters by rotational invariant techniques ( esprit ) ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of estimating multidimensional ( md ) frequencies arises in various applications including array processing , radar , sonar , astronomy and medical imaging .",
    "inspired by the results in the 1d case , several computational subspace methods have been proposed for 2d frequency estimation such as 2d music @xcite , 2d esprit @xcite , matrix enhancement and matrix pencil ( memp ) @xcite and the multidimensional folding ( mdf ) techniques @xcite . however , a fundamental question remains unresolved as to whether an analog of the vandermonde decomposition result holds true in the 2d or more general in the md case .",
    "note that the data covariance matrix corresponding to md frequency estimation is a multilevel toeplitz ( mlt ) matrix ( see the definition in the next section ) .",
    "consequently , the question can be phrased as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given a psd , rank - deficient mlt matrix , does it always admit a vandermonde - like decomposition parameterized by md frequencies ?",
    "in other words , can this matrix be always the covariance matrix of an md sinusoidal signal ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    an answer to the above question has recently become important due to the super - resolution framework in @xcite which studies the recovery of fine details in a sparse ( 1d or md ) frequency spectrum from coarse scale time - domain samples .",
    "with compressive measurements super - resolution actually generalizes the compressed sensing problem in @xcite to the continuous ( as opposed to discretized / gridded ) frequency setting and is referred to as off - grid or continuous compressed sensing @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite proposed a convex optimization method based on the atomic norm ( or total variation norm , see @xcite ) and proved that in the noiseless case the frequencies can be recovered with infinite precision provided that they are sufficiently separated .",
    "unlike other methods , the atomic norm method is stable in the presence of noise and can deal with missing data @xcite .",
    "it was also extended to the multi - snapshot case in array processing @xcite .",
    "moreover , a reweighted atomic norm method with enhanced sparsity and resolution was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the atomic norm is a continuous counterpart of the @xmath8 norm .",
    "a finite - dimensional formulation of it is required for numerical computations . in the 1d case a semidefinite program ( sdp ) formulation",
    "was provided based on the vandermonde decomposition of toeplitz matrices @xcite . however , in the md case a similar result has not been available as an analog of the vandermonde decomposition was unknown .",
    "interestingly , an sdp formulation with unspecified parameters was derived in @xcite based on duality and the bounded real lemma for multivariate trigonometric polynomials @xcite , which indeed is related to an mlt matrix whose dimension though is left unspecified . a relaxed version of this formulation has also been applied in @xcite to the 2d case .    in this paper , we generalize the carathodory - fejr s result from the 1d to the md case and provide an affirmative answer to the question asked above in the case when the matrix rank is lower than the dimension of each toeplitz block .",
    "the new matrix @xmath6 in the resulting decomposition ( see ) , which is still called vandermonde , is the khatri - rao product of several vandermonde matrices .",
    "a constructive method is provided for finding the vandermonde decomposition . when the matrix rank is higher a numerical approach",
    "is also proposed that is guaranteed to find a vandermonde decomposition if some conditions are satisfied .    to demonstrate the usefulness of the vandermonde decomposition presented in this paper , we study the md super - resolution problem with compressive measurements . a precise formulation of the atomic @xmath0 norm is derived based on the decomposition .",
    "practical algorithms for solving the atomic @xmath0 norm minimization problem are proposed based on convex relaxation as well as on nonconvex relaxation and reweighted minimization .",
    "frequency retrieval is finally accomplished using the proposed vandermonde decomposition algorithms .",
    "numerical results are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed solutions over the state - of - the - art .",
    "similarly to this paper that generalizes the carathodory - fejr s vandermonde decomposition from the 1d to the md case , other related generalizations have also been attempted in the literature . in @xcite the uniqueness part of",
    "the carathodory - fejr s result was generalized to the md case .",
    "different from our result , @xcite focused on the identifiability of parameters of md complex exponentials given discrete samples of their superposition .",
    "an analogous decomposition was presented in @xcite for state - covariance matrices ( including the toeplitz case ) of stable linear filters driven by certain time - series .",
    "the author also studied its multivariable counterpart in @xcite .",
    "though the state - covariance matrices in @xcite include block toeplitz matrices , which further include the mlt ones , the decomposition derived in @xcite is less structured than and does not imply the decomposition given in this paper .",
    "a similar decomposition of block toeplitz matrices as in @xcite was also introduced in @xcite which , as we will see , is useful for deriving the result of this paper .",
    "a recent paper @xcite attempted to generalize the vandermonde decomposition to the 2d case and provided a result similar to theorem [ thm : vanderdec ] in the present paper ; however , its proof is incomplete and some derivations are flawed .",
    "in fact , its proof is almost identical to that in @xcite for block toeplitz matrices ( see remark [ rem : chi ] ) .",
    "toeplitz matrices can be viewed as discrete counterparts of toeplitz operators that together with hankel ones form an important class in operator theory . in the 1d case",
    ", kronecker discovered in the nineteenth century a vandermonde - like decomposition of hankel matrices that holds in general with the exception of degenerate cases @xcite .",
    "the vandermonde decomposition by carathodory and fejr can be viewed as a more precise result of kronecker s theorem obtained by imposing the condition of psdness that completely avoids the degenerate cases .",
    "a recent paper @xcite studied the multivariable hankel operators and showed that kronecker s theorem in the md case differs from its 1d counterpart in several key aspects .",
    "in particular , an ml hankel matrix often does not admit a vandermonde - like decomposition .",
    "in contrast , we show in this paper that by imposing the psdness all the mlt matrices admit a vandermonde decomposition under an appropriate rank condition . in this context",
    "we note that it would be of interest to investigate the continuous counterpart of the result of this paper for multivariable toeplitz operators .",
    "the vandermonde decomposition of mlt matrices provides the theoretical basis of several subspace methods for 2d and higher - dimensional frequency estimation proposed in the 1990s , which typically estimate the frequencies from an estimate of the mlt covariance matrix ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the super - resolution methods presented in this paper are inspired by @xcite and also can be viewed as covariance - based methods similarly to the subspace methods ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "but the main difference is that in this paper the covariance estimates are obtained by optimization of sophisticated covariance - fitting criteria that fully exploit the mlt structure and utilize signal sparsity .",
    "moreover , the used criteria work in the presence of missing data .",
    "note that 2d frequency estimation has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite analyzed the performance of the atomic norm method , which generalizes the result in @xcite from the 1d to the 2d case . both @xcite and @xcite exploited the low - rankness of a certain 2-level hankel matrix formed using the data samples . since the methods in these papers actually can be applied to the case of general complex exponentials , their use for the frequency estimation of sinusoids appears to produce suboptimal results .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above a vandermonde - like decomposition may not exist for an ml hankel matrix @xcite and therefore the use of the decomposition for parameter retrieval can be problematic .",
    "notations used in this paper are as follows .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the sets of real , complex and integer numbers respectively .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the unit circle @xmath13 $ ] by identifying the beginning and the ending points .",

    ", @xmath21 is understood elementwise .",
    "for two square matrices @xmath6 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 means that @xmath24 is positive semidefinite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : notation ] introduces some preliminaries .",

    "the same behavior can be observed for @xmath391 as well .",
    "it can also be seen from this figure that for rwtm + mapp the @xmath388 data loss causes only a small performance degradation for @xmath391 and @xmath386 .",
    "since wimdf is a subspace method and its main computations include a singular value decomposition and a small - scale optimization problem for parameter tuning , it is very fast in practice and needs about 0.1s on average for a single run .",
    "because rwtm + mapp adopts a more sophisticated optimization method , it requires 3 to 38s on average when @xmath379 increases from 4 to 10 , while the computational time of convrelax + mapp is about 1/5 of that required by rwtm + mapp .",
    "the increased computational cost of rwtm + mapp and convrelax + mapp can be justified by the fact that , unlike wimdf , they can be applied to the compressive data case .",
    "it is also worth noting that the proposed methods can be accelerated using faster solvers for sdp , e.g. , the admm algorithm @xcite ( see @xcite for examples in the 1d case ) .",
    "in this paper , the vandermonde decomposition of toeplitz matrices was generalized from the 1d to the md case under a rank condition . when this condition is not satisfied a numerical approach",
    "was also proposed for finding a possible decomposition .",
    "the new results were used to study the md super - resolution problem and practical algorithms were proposed .",
    "extensive numerical simulations were provided to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed super - resolution methods .",
    "the result on vandermonde decomposition presented in this paper is closely related to operator theory and structured linear algebra .",
    "its application to these areas would be of interest .",
    "when the matrix rank is high , the question on existence of the vandermonde decomposition is still open , which should also be studied in the future .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "fredrik andersson and dr .",
    "marcus carlsson of lund university , sweden , for helpful discussions on the proof of lemma [ lem : tdiag ] .",
    "consider a hankel matrix @xmath392 defined as if @xmath393 can be written as where @xmath140 , @xmath3 , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are distinct points in @xmath12 , then @xmath142 must be a diagonal matrix .",
    "[ lem : hankel ]    we make use of the kronecker s theorem for hankel matrices ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath394 . also let @xmath395 be the principal submatrix of @xmath393 obtained by removing the last row and column .",

    "interested readers are referred to @xcite for the specific forms of @xmath401 and @xmath402 .",
    "we will use the following facts : 1 ) any @xmath403 generalized vandermonde matrix has full column rank if @xmath404 , and 2 ) @xmath402 becomes a diagonal matrix if @xmath401 is a vandermonde matrix . from the equality it follows that @xmath405 .",
    "this means that each column @xmath406 , @xmath172 in @xmath401 is a linear combination of the columns in @xmath6 and thus the @xmath407 matrix @xmath408 is rank - deficient . by the assumption that @xmath409 and the properties of generalized vandermonde matrices mentioned above , it follows that @xmath406 is a column in @xmath6 and thus @xmath401 is a vandermonde matrix formed by @xmath410 columns in @xmath6 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath402 is a diagonal matrix . as a result",
    ", we conclude by that @xmath142 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal consists of that in @xmath402 and @xmath411 zeros up to re - sorting .",
    "now we can prove lemma [ lem : tdiag ] in the case of @xmath89 for which becomes let @xmath393 and @xmath412 be the matrices obtained by sorting the rows of @xmath1 and @xmath6 in reverse order , respectively .",

    "we conclude that @xmath416 is a diagonal matrix and so is @xmath142 .",
    "now suppose that lemma [ lem : tdiag ] holds for @xmath161 , @xmath417 .",
    "by induction it suffices to show that lemma [ lem : tdiag ] also holds for @xmath163 .",
    "let us view @xmath1 as an @xmath42 block toeplitz matrix .",
    "for the @xmath418th block , @xmath419 the following identity holds by : where @xmath420 denotes @xmath66 after removing the first row and @xmath421 .",
    "let @xmath422 , @xmath423 , denote the non - redundant collection of @xmath424 and let @xmath425 be the matrix which is such that @xmath426 .",
    "then , becomes note that @xmath427 , @xmath419 are all @xmath38 , @xmath167lt matrices and @xmath170 , @xmath428 are distinct points in @xmath429 . by the assumption that lemma [ lem : tdiag ] holds for @xmath161 we have that are all diagonal matrices .",
    "let @xmath430 .",
    "its @xmath431th entry satisfies the equation : we next study some properties of @xmath432 .",
    "define @xmath433 , @xmath434 . according to the definition of @xmath432 it holds that",

    "using we can write the @xmath185th entry of @xmath442 in as note that holds whenever @xmath419 and that @xmath443 whenever @xmath188 . therefore , when @xmath188 we have the following identity : where @xmath444 , @xmath434 all have full column rank since @xmath438 , @xmath439 are distinct , and @xmath445 is a submatrix of @xmath142 with rows indexed by @xmath435 and columns indexed by @xmath446",
    ". it immediately follows that which means that @xmath142 is a block diagonal matrix after properly sorting its rows and columns with respect to @xmath435 , @xmath447 .",
    "next , we show that @xmath142 is also a block diagonal matrix when its rows and columns are sorted in another way .",
    "let @xmath448 be the permutation matrix satisfying that for any @xmath217 . then , remains a @xmath31lt matrix by exchanging the roles of the first and the second dimension of the @xmath31d frequencies . by viewing @xmath449 as an @xmath450 block toeplitz matrix",
    ", we can repeat the analysis above .",
    "in particular , we can similarly define @xmath451 and @xmath452 according to the partition of @xmath453 , where @xmath454 denotes @xmath64 with the second element removed .",
    "then @xmath142 is a block diagonal matrix when its rows and columns are sorted based on @xmath452 .",
    "now we are ready to show that @xmath142 is a diagonal matrix using contradiction .",
    "to do so , suppose that @xmath455 for some @xmath456 . by there",
    "must exist some @xmath441 such that @xmath457 .",

    "similarly , there must exist some @xmath459 such that @xmath460 and thus @xmath461 .",
    "it therefore holds that @xmath462 , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath64 , @xmath59 are distinct .",
    "we complete the proof in four steps . in _",
    "step 1 _ , we show that the optimizer @xmath463 of the problem in is bounded for @xmath464 .",

    "let also @xmath468 and @xmath469 .",
    "then we have that by the optimality of @xmath466 , it holds that @xmath470 and thus inserting into , we have that @xmath471 is bounded .",
    "moreover , by we also have that and hence , @xmath326 is bounded as well .    in _ step 2 _ , we show that @xmath472 for any @xmath464 , where @xmath473 is a constant .",
    "to do so , suppose that there exist @xmath474 , @xmath475 such that @xmath476 .",
    "since @xmath463 is bounded , without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath477 , as @xmath478 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath479 since @xmath480 , as @xmath478 . on the other hand",
    ", it must hold that therefore , @xmath481 is a feasible solution to the problem in .",
    "it follows that @xmath482 , contradicting the fact that @xmath479 as shown previously .    in _ step 3 _",
    ", we prove the first part of the proposition . by and",
    "the inequality @xmath472 shown in _",
    "step 2 _ we have that where @xmath483 is a constant independent of @xmath328 . on the other hand , since any optimizer of the problem in is a feasible solution to the problem in , it is easy to see that where @xmath484 is also a constant .",
    "combining and proves the first part .    to prove the second part of the proposition , in _ step 4",
    "_ , we refine as combining and , we have that it follows that moreover , by any cluster point of @xmath326 at @xmath329 has rank no greater than @xmath317 . on the other hand ,",
