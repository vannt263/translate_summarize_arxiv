    "observations of quasars at redshifts @xmath4 show that there is strong cosmological evolution in the number of lyman-@xmath0  lines , which can be characterised by a power law @xmath5 ( sargent _ et al . _  1980 ) , where @xmath6 is the number of lines above a threshold rest - frame equivalent width @xmath7 ( typically @xmath8 ) .",

    "the evolution is still stronger : williger _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) find @xmath12 for @xmath13 using the ctio 4 m telescope .",

    "these simulations show that the weaker lyman-@xmath0  lines ( neutral hydrogen column density @xmath17 @xmath18 ) are predominantly produced in the filamentary and sheet - like structures that form naturally in this structure formation scenario .",
    "velocity structure in these lines is often due to residual hubble flow since many of the absorbing structures are expanding .",
    "in contrast , the stronger lines ( @xmath19 @xmath18 ) tend to occur when the line of sight passes near a dense virialised halo .    over the redshift range investigated in these simulations a photo - ionizing background close to that inferred from quasars ( haardt & madau 1996 ) is required to explain the properties of the lyman-@xmath0  forest .",
    "in fact , although most simulations have assumed a critical density , scale - invariant cdm universe , other variants of the cdm model provide acceptable fits with relatively small changes to the ionizing background ( cen _ et al . _  1994 , miralda - escud _ et al . _",
    "the general success of cdm - like models in explaining the high redshift ( @xmath20 ) properties of the lyman-@xmath0  forest is impressive .    in this _",
    "letter _ we investigate using hydrodynamic simulations whether a cdm universe with a photo - ionizing background dominated by quasars can explain the observed transition in the cosmological evolution of the number of lyman-@xmath0  lines at @xmath3 .",
    "we model the evolution of a periodic , cubical region of a critical density einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "we use a simulation code based on a hierarchical p3 m implementation ( couchman 1991 ) for gravity and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( lucy 1977 , gingold & monaghan 1977 , see _ e.g.  _ monaghan 1992 for a review ) for hydrodynamics ( theuns _ et al . _",

    "these simulations use @xmath33 particles of either species hence the gas mass resolutions are @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath27mpc , respectively .",
    "gas in these simulations is ionized and photo - heated by an imposed uniform background of ionizing photons assumed to originate from quasars as computed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "this flux is redshift dependent , mimicking the evolution of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "gas can also cool by interacting with microwave background photons and through collisional cooling .",
    "the detailed rates for all these processes as a function of temperature are taken from cen ( 1992 ) with some minor modifications .",
    "we assume ionization equilibrium throughout and use a helium abundance of @xmath37 by mass . we have compared in detail the results from our code against the published results of treesph ( hernquist _ et al . _",

    "the effective mean optical depth @xmath38 from the simulations , with this set of parameters , is significantly lower than the observed value .",
    "consequently , we have reduced the amplitude @xmath39 of the ionizing radiation given by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) by a factor of two . here , @xmath39 is the amplitude of the radiation spectrum at the hydrogen lyman edge . since @xmath38 scales approximately as @xmath40 ( rauch _ et al .",
    "1997 ) , we would obtain the same results by keeping the original value of @xmath39 from haardt & madau but increase @xmath41 from 0.0125 to 0.0177 , which is still well within the range allowed by nucleo - synthesis .    at several output times",
    "we compute simulated spectra along lines of sight through the simulation box .",
    "each spectrum is convolved with a gaussian with fwhm = 8 km s@xmath25 , then re - sampled onto pixels of width 3 km s@xmath25 to mimic the instrumental profile and characteristics of the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope .",
    "artificial noise is introduced by adding a gaussian random signal with zero mean , and standard deviation @xmath42 to every pixel ( _ i.e .  _ a snr of 50 for pixels at the continuum ) .",

    "fluctuations in neutral hydrogen density , caused by gas tracing dark matter potential wells , produce absorption features similar to those in observed spectra . at low redshifts ,",
    "there are large regions of the spectrum with very low absorption .",
    "these regions are separated by prominent absorption features , most of which are just a single strong line . at higher redshifts ,",

    "there is clear evolution in the simulated column density distribution with redshift .",
    "the rate of change depends on column density , with higher column density lines undergoing stronger evolution leading to steepening of the distribution . at @xmath44 ,",
    "the column density distribution is @xmath45 whereas this has steepened to @xmath46 at @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the rate of evolution also depends on redshift , with considerably stronger evolution at higher redshifts .",
    "the number of weak lyman-@xmath0  lines ( @xmath47 @xmath18 ) remains approximately constant . at redshifts 3 and 2",
    ", there is good agreement between the simulated column density distribution for our higher resolution simulation ( @xmath27  mpc ) and the observed one .",
    "the drop in the number of lines with redshift can be quantified by counting the number of lines within a given column density range .",
    "the simulation results are compared to observations in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the simulations reproduce well the number of lines at a given redshift for all three column density cuts .",
    "crucially , they also match very well the observed number of lines at low redshift .",
    "consequently , the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation in a critical density universe , coupled with the observed evolution in the quasar luminosity function , can explain the observed evolution of the number of lyman-@xmath0  lines over the entire observed redshift range .",
    "we have re - analysed the @xmath1 output time after increasing the imposed ionization flux from its @xmath1 value to the value appropriate to @xmath44 .",
    "the number of lines with @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath18 is shown by the open pentagon in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this point falls onto the extrapolation for the number density evolution for @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , the dominant reason for the higher number of lines at low @xmath11 compared to what would be expected by extrapolation from high @xmath11 , is the decrease in ionizing flux from @xmath44 to @xmath50 , itself a consequence of the evolution of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "an estimate of the reliability of these simulations can be obtained by comparing the two simulations run at different resolutions .",
    "the higher resolution simulation produces more lines at all column densities , but the difference between the two simulations is well within the error bars of the observational results .",
    "this gives us confidence that we can reliable predict the number of lines from these simulations .    in summary",
    ": our numerical simulations show that the properties of the lyman-@xmath0  forest are in excellent agreement with what is expected in a cold dark matter universe with a photo - ionizing background dominated by quasar light .",
    "in particular , our simulations show that the observed decrease in the rate of evolution of lyman-@xmath0  absorption lines at @xmath3 can be explained by the steep decline in the photo - ionizing background resulting from the rapid decline in quasar numbers at low redshift .",
