    "the number of candidates for tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , in which stars are tidally disrupted by a massive black hole , has been rapidly increasing ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "various stellar types can be considered , including a main sequence star , a red giant star , and a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "so far , several high energy transients have been proposed to be tdes of wds ( wd  tdes ) @xcite .    among various implications ,",
    "finding wd  tdes is of special importance to address the existence of an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh )  a black hole ( bh ) disrupting a wd can be an imbh .",
    "this is because a supermassive bh ( smbh ) with more than @xmath6 just swallows a wd rather than disrupts it .",
    "wd  tdes can thus be an important probe to imbhs , since a large number of wd  tdes may be detected with the aid of current transient surveys ( e.g. , intermediate palomar transient factory ) and next - generation transient surveys ( e.g. the zwicky transient facility and the large synoptic survey telescope ) . in the future , the detections of wd  tdes could constrain the abundance of imbhs in the universe , although just a few imbh candidates have ever been discovered by x - ray observatories , e.g. , m82  x-1 @xcite and hlx-1 @xcite . the abundance of imbhs will place constraints on the formation scenarios of smbhs .",
    "a wd  tde can probably be observed as various types of transients .",
    "we focus on the possibility of the wd  tde observed as an optical transient resulting from its thermonuclear explosion , although there are many studies for possible signatures of wd  tdes as other types of transients @xcite . in a wd",
    "tde , the wd is heated by compression in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "hereafter , the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane is called the @xmath7-direction",
    ". then , the wd could undergo explosive nuclear burning , yielding radioactive nuclei such as @xmath8ni . .",
    "@xcite studied wd  tdes and their nucleosynthesis signatures .",
    "using rosswog et al.s data of @xmath9 carbon - oxygen ( co ) wd , @xcite predicted the light curve and spectrum of the wd  tde .    to initiate explosive nuclear burning in a wd tde , not only an adiabatic compression but also a shock heating are required in order to reach high temperature .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : dens - entr ] , a material consisting of helium ( he ) , co , or oxygen - neon - magnesium ( onemg ) needs to be adiabatically compressed by more than four orders of magnitude to rise its temperature from @xmath4  k to @xmath10  k ( he ) , or @xmath11  k ( co and onemg ) , above which the explosive nuclear burning is triggered .",
    "however , it is difficult to compress a wd by more than four orders of magnitude . as seen from figure  1 of @xcite , @xmath12 , which is the ratio of the tidal radius of the wd to a pericenter distance between the wd and imbh ,",
    "is permitted up to about @xmath13 .",
    "the scale height of the wd in the @xmath7-direction , @xmath14 , is estimated as @xmath15 at the pericenter , where @xmath16 is the original radius of the wd .",
    "therefore , the wd is compressed by at most a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , we overestimate the compression of the wd in the above discussion , since the wd is not only compressed in the @xmath7-direction , but also elongated in the direction of the orbital plane .    an additional heating by the shock wave is therefore required for initiating the nuclear reactions , however it is not clear whether previous simulations have high resolution enough to detect such a shock wave . @xcite",
    "have performed smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations with up to @xmath18 million particles . since more than",
    "@xmath19 particles are aligned in the @xmath7-direction , these simulations seem to resolve the shock wave",
    ". however , the wd is elongated in the direction of the orbital plane , and the number of particles in the @xmath7-direction should be fewer than @xmath19 , where the shock front should be perpendicular to the @xmath7-direction @xcite . @xcite",
    "have performed mesh - based simulations for a wd  tde of @xmath9 co  wd encountered by a @xmath20 imbh with @xmath21 , and have suggested that explosive nuclear burning is triggered at the pericenter passage .",
    "if the original radius of the wd is @xmath22  cm , the scale height of the wd in the @xmath7-direction , @xmath14 should be @xmath23  cm .",
    "on the other hand , the finest mesh size of their simulation is about @xmath2  cm , larger than @xmath14 .    in this paper , we perform high - resolution simulations of wd  tdes .",
    "we aim to investigate whether these simulations accurately follow a thermonuclear explosion in wd  tdes , and what is numerically required to follow the explosion .",

    "in this section , we describe our simulation method .",
    "we overview our sph code in section  [ sec : code ] .",

    "the number of neighbor particles of a given particle is about @xmath25 ( 3d ) and about @xmath26 ( 1d ) unless otherwise specified .",
    "neighbor particles are defined as particles which are inside a sphere centered at a given particle with its kernel - support radius , where the sph kernel function reaches zero at the kernel - support radius .",

    "we adopt the routines to calculate the helmholtz eos and aprox13 developed by the center for astrophysical thermonuclear flashes at the university of chicago .",
    "we follow the evolution of wd  tdes by means of our sph code coupled with the nuclear reaction network .",
    "we adopt sph modeling for the wds , and use a fixed potential to model the imbh gravity .    for the imbh potential ,",
    "we adopt three kinds of models : newtonian potential ( np ) , the paczyski - wiita ( pw ) potential with the modification by @xcite , and a generalized newtonian potential obtained by @xcite , hereafter called tr potential , for the treatment of a bh with no spin ( see also @xcite for the treatment of a spinning bh ) . the imbh is located on the coordinate origin .",
    "none of them considers the imbh spin .",
    "our initial conditions are summarized in table  [ tab : initial ] .",

    "the parameter set of model co1 is the same as run  8 of @xcite .",
    "however , the wd radii might be different between theirs and ours due to different ways to make initial conditions .",
    "this might make a difference between the pericenter distance of wds in rosswog s run  8 and in our model co1 , although @xmath34 in both models .    additionally , we investigate three models .",
    "the first and second ones are the same as models onemg and co1 , respectively , except without solving a nuclear reaction network .",

    "in section  [ sec:3d ] , we present the results of our 3d sph simulations .",
    "the results show that the amount of the materials experiencing explosive nuclear burning is decreased with increasing @xmath0 , and that the explosive nuclear burning found in these simulations is a numerical artifact due to low resolution , not physical effects .",

    "fig : n - element ] , we summarize the masses of the original , si group , and fe group elements at the time just after nuclear reactions have ceased .",
    "mass accreted by an imbh at this time is negligible .",
    "the difference in the nuclear burning products does not come from mass accretion , but comes from the nuclear reactions .    in model onemg ,",
    "the amount of original ( unburned ) elements increases , and the amounts of si and fe group elements decrease , with increasing @xmath0 . in models",
    "co , the amount of si group elements decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "although the amount of the original elements decreases first , it finally increases from some @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of fe group on @xmath0 is opposite to that of the original elements . in model",
    "he , the dependence of each element on @xmath0 is similar to those of models co , although the dependence is smaller .",
    "overall , the amount of unburned materials increases at large @xmath0 ( say @xmath65 ) regardless of the wd masses and compositions .",
    "since the nucleosynthesis of model onemg indicates the strongest dependence on @xmath0 , we show thermodynamical quantities of model onemg in figure  [ fig : xyplane_onemg ] . at the time , nuclear reactions are still in progress .",
    "the density of particles is not sensitive to @xmath0 ( see the top panels ) . on the other hand ,",
    "their temperature strongly depends on @xmath0 ( see the second top panels ) . high - temperature ( say @xmath66  k ) region becomes smaller as @xmath0 increases .",
    "as the high - temperature region becomes smaller , the amount of the unburned materials increases ( see the second bottom panels ) , and the amount of @xmath8ni decreases ( see the bottom panels ) , since the materials consisting of onemg experience explosive nuclear burning at a temperature above @xmath67  k.    figure  [ fig : xzplane_onemg ] shows the structure of model onemg on a plane perpendicular to the orbital plane . although most of the materials are burned out for @xmath68 m , the kernel - support radius is comparable to the scale height of the structure in the @xmath7-direction . for @xmath69 m , only a small portion of the wd experiences nuclear reactions .",
    "however , the scale height of the small portion is comparable to the kernel - support radius .",
    "a large portion of the wd , where the scale height is much larger than the kernel - support radius , is not burned .",
    "overall , the kernel - support radius becomes sufficiently smaller than the scale height as @xmath0 increases .",
    "instead , nuclear reactions become inactive .",
    "the nuclear reactions occur only when the sph simulations do not resolve the scale height of the structure in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "therefore , we conclude that nuclear reactions artificially occur due to numerical effects , not due to physical effects , even if @xmath0 is a few @xmath2 .",
    "we investigate model onemg w / o nuc in order to confirm that nuclear reactions falsely occur , not due to any errors in our nuclear reaction network , but due to the resolution effect of our sph simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : xyplane_onemg.wonuc ] shows thermodynamical quantities of model onemg w / o nuc on the orbital plane .",
    "the density distributions are similar to those in model onemg .",
    "the temperature distributions are different from those in model onemg .",
    "overall , the temperature in this model is lower than in model onemg , since the nuclear reaction network is turned off .",
    "the distribution of the maximum temperature each particle experiences from @xmath70  s to @xmath71  s is a good indicator for where explosive nuclear burning would occur from @xmath70  s to @xmath71  s if the nuclear reaction network was turned on .",
    "materials which reach a temperature of @xmath67  k experience explosive nuclear burning if their density is more than several @xmath72  g  @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , explosive nuclear burning would occur in red regions .",
    "these red regions are almost coincident with the regions where original components are burned out and a large amount of @xmath8ni is produced in model onemg ( see figure  [ fig : xyplane_onemg ] ) .",
    "moreover , these red regions shrink as @xmath0 increases , which is consistent with the results in model onemg .",
    "figure  [ fig : xzplane_onemg.wonuc ] shows the temperature distributions on cross sections in model onemg w / o nuc .",
    "the locations of the cross sections are the same as those in model onemg . in @xmath68 m",
    ", temperature is more than @xmath67  k almost in the region .",
    "therefore , explosive nuclear burning would occur .",
    "the kernel - support radii are comparable to the scale heights over all the range of @xmath73-coordinate . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the kernel - support radii becomes smaller , and the temperature becomes lower . in @xmath69 m , the kernel - support radii at @xmath74  cm are smaller than the scale height by a factor of a few , and the temperature is lower than @xmath22  k. explosive nuclear burning would not occur there . at @xmath75  cm ,",
    "the kernel - support radii are comparable to the scale height , and the temperature is more than @xmath76  k. explosive nuclear burning would occur .",
    "these results are consistent with those in model onemg .",
    "therefore , explosive nuclear burning in model onemg occurs when sph simulations fail to resolve the scale heights of wd  tdes .",
    "in other words , nuclear reactions seen in the low - resolution runs are a numerical artifact due to spurious heating of sph simulation .",
    "we comment the reasons why a leading part of the wd remains high temperature with increasing @xmath0 , and why a trailing part of the wd gets lower temperature with increasing @xmath0 ( see the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : xyplane_onemg.wonuc ] ) . at the pericenter passage ,",
    "the leading part is closer to an imbh than the trailing part .",
    "the leading part has smaller scale height than the trailing part .",
    "our sph simulations almost resolve the scale height of the trailing part unless @xmath77 ( see figure  [ fig : xzplane_onemg.wonuc ] ) .",
    "however , our sph simulations fail to resolve the scale height of the leading part , even if @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the leading part gets high temperature , even if @xmath3 .",
    "there is another evidence that the nuclear reactions occur only when the kernel - support radii of particles are comparable to the scale height of the structure . in model onemg - h ,",
    "the kernel - support radii do not become smaller by design even if @xmath0 increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : n - element ] shows that the nucleosynthesis of model onemg - h is much less sensitive to @xmath0 than that of model onemg .    finally , we search for shock waves in model onemg w / o nuc , focusing on regions where the sph kernel is smaller than the scale height .",
    "however we find no shock wave .",
    "if the shock waves were generated , temperature would increase discontinuously in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "however , we do not find such a temperature structure , for example in the right panel of figure  [ fig : xzplane_onemg.wonuc ] .",
    "we do not find shock waves in model onemg w / o nuc , despite the fact that sph kernel - support radii are smaller than the scale height ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig : xzplane_onemg.wonuc ] ) .",
    "we suspect that the absence of the shock waves is due to the low resolution of our simulations , even with @xmath78 . in order to clarify the issue , we perform 1d planar simulations with high resolution , by extracting local flow structures from model onemg w / o nuc with @xmath69 m . for the 1d planar simulations ,",
    "we use our 1d sph code and flash code .",
    "we make initial conditions for the 1d simulations as follows .",
    "we re - perform 3d sph simulations in order to record physical quantities of particles at every timestep .",
    "the recorded particles are located at regions pointed by white crosses in the rightmost panel of figure  [ fig : xyplane_onemg.wonuc ] . from bottom to top , particles get higher temperature .",
    "so , we call these regions `` low - t region '' , `` middle - t region '' , and `` high - t region '' from bottom to top .    from the recorded data in each region , we extract physical quantities at the moment when @xmath7-direction relative velocities between the outermost particle and a particle on the orbital plane reaches a peak .",
    "based on distribution of density and velocity of the extracted data along the @xmath7-direction , we map particles for 1d simulations , and assign physical quantities for 1d mesh .",
    "we fix the temperature to be @xmath2  k. for the flash simulations , we put atmosphere with a constant density of @xmath79  g  @xmath31 if there is no wd material .",
    "the total mass of atmosphere is negligible , ( @xmath80  % of the total mass of wd materials ) .",
    "we describe the recipe of the 1d sph and flash simulations in the following .",
    "we consider only hydrodynamics for both 1d sph and flash simulations .",
    "we do not solve nuclear reactions unless otherwise specified .",
    "furthermore , neither do we consider self gravity among particles , nor the imbh gravity .",
    "the number of particles we use is @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath1 for the 1d sph simulations .",
    "the number of grids we use is @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "note that the space resolution in the largest @xmath0 and @xmath86 is @xmath87  cm and @xmath88  cm for the 1d sph and flash simulations , respectively . in some cases of @xmath89 , we perform additional simulations , solving hydrodynamics coupled with the nuclear reaction network .    in the cases of the low - t and high - t regions ,",
    "we perform additional 1d sph simulations with @xmath90 and flash simulations with @xmath89 . in these simulations",
    ", we change the initial @xmath7-direction velocity by increasing the @xmath7-direction velocity for the low - t region , and by decreasing the @xmath7-direction velocity for the high - t region , so that density at @xmath91 in 1d simulations is equal to that in 3d simulations when materials are most compressed .",
    "the reason for this additional setups is the following .",
    "we underestimate and overestimate the compression of materials in the low - t and high - t regions , respectively , without the correction of the @xmath7-direction velocity ( hereafter , @xmath92 correction ) .",
    "these underestimate and overestimate come from the facts that we do not consider an imbh and self gravity , and that materials are not elongated in the direction of the orbital plane in these 1d simulations , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim1d ] shows the results of the 1d simulations .",
    "we set the initial time ( i.e. @xmath70  s ) to be the time when these 1d simulations are started .",
    "for the low - t region with @xmath81 , the temperature on the orbital plane becomes high due to the spurious heating .",
    "actually , the spurious heating is seen in the results of low - resolution simulations , i.e. the 1d sph simulations with @xmath81 and the flash simulations with @xmath83 ( see figure  [ fig : flash ] ) , regardless of the regions .",
    "this is consistent with our 3d sph simulations in section  [ sec:3d ] .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : sim1d ] , the results of the 1d sph simulations are in good agreement with those of flash simulations , if the simulations have high resolution , i.e. the 1d sph simulations with @xmath90 and the flash simulations with @xmath89 . for this comparison , atmosphere should be ignored .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the convergence of these results against @xmath0 and @xmath86 . comparing the results of @xmath93 and @xmath1 in the 1d sph simulations , and those of @xmath94 and @xmath85 in the flash simulations , we find these results are quite similar .",
    "therefore , these results are converged against @xmath0 and @xmath86 .    as seen in the high - resolution results of figure  [ fig : sim1d ] , in all the regions ,",
    "shock waves are observed . in order to investigate whether these shock waves trigger detonation waves , we perform flash simulations coupled with the nuclear reaction network for the middle - t region .",
    "we consider two cases where materials consist of co and onemg .",
    "fluid motion for the co and onemg cases is the same as fluid motion for the case without considering nuclear reactions until a shock wave emerges at @xmath95  s. the middle - t panels of figure  [ fig : sim1d ] show the fluid motion in the case without considering nuclear reactions . at @xmath70",
    "s , all the materials shrink . at @xmath96  s , materials at @xmath97  cm bounce back . at @xmath95",
    "s , a shock wave is generated at @xmath98  cm . at this time , materials at @xmath99  cm are expanding , and the rest are shrinking .",
    "the fraction of the expanding materials is @xmath100  % .",
    "we emphasize that the shrinking materials ( i.e. @xmath101  % of materials ) are not atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : det_extt ] shows the time evolution of @xmath7-direction velocity , density , temperature , and mass fractions of nuclear elements for the two cases after the shock wave emerges at @xmath102  s. for both the cases , the shock waves which emerges at @xmath103  s proceed in the positive @xmath7-direction ( see panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "hereafter , a shock wave proceeding in the positive @xmath7-direction is referred as `` forward shock wave '' . only for the co case",
    ", a reverse shock wave emerges at @xmath104  cm , which can be seen as the discontinuous decrease of @xmath7-direction velocity ( see figure  [ fig : det_extt_zoom ] and panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "the reverse shock wave is formed , such that materials behind the reverse shock wave experience explosive nuclear burning ( see panels ( g ) and ( i ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) , get high temperature ( see panel ( e ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) , rapidly expand , and push back materials in front of the reverse shock wave .",
    "the forward shock wave for the co case has higher velocity than for the onemg case , since the former is energized by more active nuclear reactions than the latter .    in the following three reasons ,",
    "we conclude that the reverse shock wave accompanies a detonation wave standing at @xmath105  cm .",
    "first , upstream materials flow across @xmath105  cm at a speed of @xmath106  cm  s@xmath107 ( see panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) , which is larger than the sound velocity of the upstream materials ( @xmath108  cm  s@xmath107 ) .",
    "second , co elements are burned out , and si and fe group elements are synthesized just behind @xmath109  cm ( see panels ( g ) and ( i ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "third , this fluid structure is long - lived .",
    "it does not decay during the simulation , although we only perform the simulation until @xmath110  s due to high calculation cost of the nuclear reaction network . from @xmath95",
    "s to @xmath111  s , @xmath112  % of materials flow across @xmath105  cm .",
    "after they experience explosive nuclear burning , they consist of @xmath113  % fe group elements , @xmath13  % si group elements , and @xmath18  % he .",
    "if we continue the simulation , the detonation wave will be sustained until at least @xmath114  s in the following reason .",
    "materials flow supersonically across @xmath109  cm from @xmath102  s to @xmath114  s in the case without considering nuclear reactions",
    ". this should be also true in the co case if the detonation wave stands at @xmath109  cm during this time .",
    "this is because upstream materials of the detonation wave should not receive the influence of nuclear reactions due to their supersonic motions .",
    "then , for the co case , materials should flow supersonically into the detonation wave , experience explosive nuclear burning , and sustain the detonation wave as fuels . during this time",
    ", more than @xmath58  % of materials should flow across the detonation wave .",
    "we expect a large amount of radioactive nuclei is synthesized .",
    "there is only the single detonation wave at @xmath105  cm ; the forward shock wave at @xmath115  s and @xmath116  cm does not accompany a detonation wave ( see the left panels of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "we explain the reason for the formation of only the single detonation wave at @xmath105  cm .",
    "the forward shock wave creates a hotspot at @xmath102  s and @xmath117  cm .",
    "the hotspot may possibly initiates double detonation waves initially ; one is the detonation wave standing at @xmath118  cm after @xmath95  s , and the other may be a detonation wave which follows the forward shock wave creating the hotspot .",
    "the former detonation wave is sustained by high - density fuels ( @xmath119  g  @xmath31 ) , while the latter detonation wave may soon decay due to the supply of only low - density fuels ( @xmath120  g  @xmath31 ) , as seen in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] .    for the convergence check of a space resolution",
    ", we also perform flash simulations with a space resolution of @xmath121  cm to @xmath122  cm for the middle - t region in the co case .",
    "we find the same detonation wave as in a space resolution of @xmath88  cm only when the space resolution is @xmath5  cm .",
    "therefore , we need simulation with a space resolution of @xmath5  cm in order to follow such a detonation wave .    for the onemg case , the forward shock wave raises the temperature of materials to @xmath123  k ( see panel ( f ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) , and triggers nuclear reactions slightly ( see panels ( h ) and ( j ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "however , the nuclear reactions cease soon",
    ". the forward shock wave does not excite explosive nuclear burning triggering a reverse shock wave and a detonation wave ( see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] )",
    ".    a forward shock wave does not always excite explosive nuclear burning triggering a reverse shock wave and a detonation wave even when materials consist of co. we also perform a flash simulation coupled with the nuclear reaction network for the low - t region with @xmath92 correction in which materials consist of co. figure  [ fig : det_lowt ] shows the time evolution . at @xmath124  s , a forward shock wave emerges at @xmath125  cm ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : det_lowt ] ) .",
    "the forward shock wave raises the temperature of the materials ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : det_lowt ] ) .",
    "it triggers nuclear reactions , however does not initiate a reverse shock wave nor a detonation wave as seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : det_lowt ] .",
    "this is quite similar to the onemg case in the middle - t region ( see panels ( b ) and ( f ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "the initiation of a detonation wave strongly depends on where a forward shock wave emerges .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff_lowt - extt ] shows density and temperature in the low - t region with @xmath92 correction and in the middle - t region when forward shock waves emerge .",
    "the forward shock wave emerges at density @xmath121 and @xmath126  g  @xmath31 for the former and latter cases , respectively .",
    "according to table  6 in @xcite , spontaneous initiation of a detonation wave requires a hotspot with size of @xmath126 and @xmath88  cm for density @xmath121 and @xmath126  g  @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "since a mesh size is @xmath127  cm , the hotspot is too small to generate a detonation wave for the former case , and is sufficiently large for the latter case .",
    "our results about the initiation of the detonation wave are consistent with the criteria in @xcite .",
    "as seen in table  8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 of @xcite , the hotspot size to generate a detonation wave becomes rapidly larger as carbon fraction becomes smaller .",
    "even when the carbon fraction decreases from @xmath58  % to @xmath128  % , a hotspot size required to generate a detonation wave becomes larger by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the reason why no detonation wave occurs for the onemg case in the middle - t region ( see the right panels of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) is that a hotspot is too small to generate a detonation wave in onemg compositions .    from the above , we find two implications .",
    "first , the resolution of 3d sph simulations is too low to resolve a forward shock wave even if @xmath130 .",
    "second , the forward shock wave does not always initiate a detonation wave even if materials consist of co.    finally , we discuss the reliability of the initiation of a detonation wave for the co case in the middle - t region . in this case ,",
    "the forward shock wave occurs , and create the hotspot generating the detonation wave where the density gradient is steep . as seen in figure  [ fig : diff_lowt - extt ] , the hotspot has density of @xmath2  g  @xmath31 , however a mesh near the hotspot has density of @xmath121  g  @xmath31 .",
    "if the forward shock wave emerges at a bit outer region , it can not trigger a detonation wave , since the forward shock wave propagates outward ( see panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : det_extt ] ) .",
    "our 1d initial conditions lack accuracy to precisely determine where a forward shock wave occurs .",
    "therefore , the initiation of a detonation wave may be unreliable . in order to follow the initiation of a detonation wave accurately ,",
    "we should perform 3d simulations with a space resolution of @xmath5  cm .",
    "note that the detonation wave in the middle - t region occurs only when a space resolution is @xmath5  cm .",
    "in this section , we discuss why materials are falsely heated in 3d sph simulation with low resolution , using model co1 which is similar to model of rosswog s run  8 .",
    "model co1 provides a solid basis for the comparison , since this parameter set is the same as that of rosswog s run  8 , and @xcite have investigated the observational features of this model . in our model ,",
    "the wds yield @xmath131 and @xmath132 of fe group elements for @xmath133 m and @xmath134 m , respectively . on the other hand , rosswog s run  8 has @xmath135 for @xmath136 m . our results are consistent with those of rosswog s run  8 from the view point of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "figure  [ fig : xyplane_co1 ] shows thermodynamical quantities of model co1 in the same way as in figure  [ fig : xyplane_onemg ] . as seen in the bottom panels , the amount of @xmath8ni increases from @xmath68 m to @xmath133 m , and decreases from @xmath137 m to @xmath69 m , which is consistent with the amount of @xmath8ni drawn in figure  [ fig : n - element ] .",
    "the increase from @xmath68 m to @xmath133 m comes from the increase of the density of particles with increasing @xmath0 ( see the top panels ) .",
    "note that @xmath8ni is more synthesized ( while artificially ) at higher density if materials experience explosive nuclear burning . the low density in @xmath68 m results in the lower temperature and larger unburned mass in @xmath68 m than those in @xmath133 m .",
    "since the density is low , the nuclear reactions are not active so much .",
    "the dependence of the density on @xmath0 can be explained as follows .",
    "as @xmath0 becomes smaller , a particle on the orbital plane has a larger kernel - support radius .",
    "sph simulation calculates the density of the particle , considering more distant particles from the orbital plane .",
    "particles are distributed more sparsely with increasing distance from the orbital plane .",
    "therefore , the density of the particle becomes smaller with a larger kernel - support radius ( smaller @xmath0 ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath8ni from @xmath137 m to @xmath69 m is also due to the same reason as the decrease in model onemg .",
    "figure  [ fig : xzplane_co1 ] shows the structure of model co1 on a plane perpendicular to the orbital plane",
    ". in @xmath69 m , the kernel - support radii of the particles are smaller than the scale height , except around @xmath138  cm where explosive nuclear burning occurs . in @xmath68 m ,",
    "@xmath139 m , and @xmath140 m , the kernel - support radii seem smaller than the scale height , even where explosive nuclear burning occurs .",
    "however , the kernel - support radius is comparable to the scale height at the time earlier than @xmath141  s.    in the following , we clarify the reason why the nuclear reactions occur if the kernel - support radius is comparable to the scale height in the @xmath7-direction . for this purpose",
    ", we follow the time evolution of particles located at the crosses in figure  [ fig : xyplane_co1 ] . in order to focus on whether the nuclear reactions start or not , we adopt model co1 w / o nuc .    figure  [ fig : dens - temp_co1 ] shows the density and temperature of these particles in @xmath133 m and @xmath59 m .",
    "since the @xmath57c + @xmath57c timescale is shorter than the local dynamical timescale in a part of particles in both @xmath0 , they would experience the explosive nuclear burning if the nuclear reaction network was turned on .",
    "we can see the trajectories of these particles in figure  [ fig : x - z_co1 ] .",
    "the trajectories are independent of @xmath0 from @xmath142  cm to @xmath143  cm .",
    "the particles are in the range of @xmath144  cm at @xmath142  cm , and in the range of @xmath145  cm at @xmath143  cm . at @xmath146  cm ,",
    "the particles in @xmath69 m are distributed slightly more densely than those in @xmath133 m .",
    "since these particles approach the orbital plane , the scale height of the structure shrinks in the @xmath7-direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the kernel - support radii of these particles keep nearly constant ; the density of the structure does not grow .",
    "this is because the structure is compressed in the @xmath7-direction , but is extended in the direction of the orbital plane .",
    "the entropy of these particles grows from some point .",
    "although their entropy increases , no shock wave is found out . if there is a shock wave , the trajectories of these particles",
    "should be changed discontinuously . moreover",
    ", their entropy in @xmath133 m grows at smaller @xmath73 ( i.e. earlier ) than those in @xmath69 m .",
    "these behaviours of their entropy are clearly not converged against @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate why the entropy increases despite the absence of a shock wave .",
    "figure  [ fig : x - vz_co1 ] shows the velocities in the @xmath7-direction and sound velocities of these particles . particles distant from the orbital plane approach the orbital plane supersonically from @xmath147  cm to @xmath148  cm , while particles near the orbital plane have small velocities in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "therefore , the relative velocities between the outermost and innermost particles from the orbital plane are supersonic .",
    "since all these particles have the kernel - support radii comparable to the scale height , the innermost particles interact supersonically with the outermost particles .",
    "then , the particles obtain entropy .",
    "the reason why particles in smaller @xmath0 obtain entropy earlier is as follows .",
    "the kernel - support radii of particles are larger in smaller @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in smaller @xmath0 , the innermost particles start interacting with the outermost particles when the scale height is still larger .",
    "as @xmath0 becomes larger , the kernel - support radii become smaller . each of the innermost and outermost particles interacts only with their adjacent particles .",
    "their relative velocities are subsonic .",
    "consequently , these particles do not gain entropy in large @xmath0 .    in summary , particles on the orbital plane",
    "are heated and gain entropy , interacting with the outermost particles from the orbital plane due to their kernel - support radii comparable to the scale height .",
    "such interactions should not happen in reality , and the heating is spurious .",
    "the spurious heating triggers explosive nuclear burning falsely .",
    "eventually , our 3d sph simulations fail to follow the nucleosynthesis in wd  tdes , even if our simulations have unprecedentedly high resolution .",
    "this should also be the case for previous simulations with lower resolution .",
    "we perform 3d sph simulations with @xmath3 to follow the tdes of he  wds , co  wds , and onemg  wds by imbhs .",
    "we observe that the explosive nuclear burning occurs in all the wds .",
    "however , the final compositions are strongly dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the amount of unburned materials increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of these wds is not converged against @xmath0 , although our simulations contain unprecedentedly large @xmath0 , up to a few @xmath2 particles .",
    "the reason why the explosive nuclear burning occurs in small-@xmath0 simulations is as follows . in such small-@xmath0 simulations ,",
    "the scale height of a wd in the @xmath7-direction becomes comparable to the kernel - support radii of particles at the pericenter passage around an imbh . on the other hand",
    ", a particle at the surface of the wd approaches the orbital plane supersonically .",
    "then , the particle interacts with other particles on the orbital plane .",
    "their interactions generate spurious heating , and trigger explosive nuclear burning falsely . if @xmath0 is sufficiently large , these particles do not interact with each other , since the kernel - support radius is sufficiently small .    by means of mesh - based simulations ,",
    "@xcite have suggested that a wd  tde can experience explosive nuclear burning .",
    "however , we conjecture that their mesh - based simulations have not either resolved the scale height of the wd in the @xmath7-direction at the pericenter passage .",
    "they have investigated tdes with @xmath9 co  wds which orbit around a @xmath149 imbh with @xmath21 .",
    "this model is similar to our model co. in our model , the scale height in the @xmath7-direction is about @xmath150  cm at the pericenter passage when @xmath34 .",
    "if the scale height is almost equal to those in @xcite , their simulations can not resolve the scale height , since their finest mesh size is about @xmath2  cm .",
    "we find no shock wave generation in 3d sph simulations with @xmath151 .",
    "so , we perform 1d sph and flash simulations with higher resolution than the 3d sph simulations in order to examine whether the absence of shock waves results from the low resolution of the 3d sph simulations . eventually , we find the following two insights .",
    "first , a shock wave emerges in both 1d sph and flash simulations . in other words ,",
    "the resolution of the current 3d sph simulations is not enough to resolve the shock wave , even if @xmath78 .",
    "second , the shock wave can trigger a detonation wave , only when it makes a hotspot large enough to generate a detonation wave . for the case of materials consisting of onemg",
    ", no shock wave triggers a detonation . for the case of materials consisting of co ,",
    "if the shock wave occurs in a low - density region ( @xmath5  g  @xmath31 ) , a hotspot formed by the shock wave is too small to generate a detonation wave .",
    "although a detonation wave occurs in a part of our 1d simulations , the initiation of the detonation wave may be unreliable for the following reason .",
    "the shock wave triggering the detonation wave occurs where the density gradient is steep .",
    "if the shock wave occurs at a bit outer region , it can not trigger the detonation wave , since it occurs in much lower density region by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "our 1d modeling lacks accuracy to precisely determine where the shock wave occurs .    in order to conclude that wd  tdes become optical transients powered by radioactive nuclei",
    ", we need to perform 3d simulations with a space resolution of @xmath5  cm .",
    "sph simulation with @xmath152 seems to satisfy this requirement .",
