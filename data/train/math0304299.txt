    "-5 mm    a lot of fascinating mathematics has been created when successful tools are transferred from one research area to another .",
    "we shall describe two instances of such transfers , both into knot theory .",
    "the first transfer realizes commutator calculus of group theory by _ embedded versions _ in 3- and 4-space , and produces many interesting geometric equivalence relations on knots , called _ grope cobordism _ in 3-space and _ grope concordance _ in 4-space .",
    "it turns out that in 3-space these new equivalence relations give a geometric interpretation ( theorem  [ thm:3d ] ) of vassiliev s finite type invariants @xcite and that the kontsevich integral @xcite calculates the new theory over @xmath0 ( theorem  [ thm : kontsevich ] ) .    in 4-space the new equivalence relations factor naturally through knot concordance , and",
    "in fact they organize all known concordance invariants in a wonderful manner ( theorem  [ thm:4d ] ) .",
    "they also point the way to new concordance invariants ( theorem  [ thm : cot2 ] ) and these are constructed using a second transfer , from the spectral theory of self - adjoint operators and von neumann s continuous dimension @xcite .",
    "to explain the first transfer into knot theory , recall that every knot bounds a seifert surface ( embedded in 3-space ) , but only the trivial knot bounds an embedded disk .",
    "thus all of knot theory is created by the difference between a surface and a disk .",
    "the new idea is to filter this difference by introducing a concept into knot theory which is the analogue of iterated commutators in group theory .",
    "commutators arise because a continuous map @xmath1 extends to a map of a surface if and only if @xmath2 represents a commutator in the fundamental group @xmath3 .",
    "iterated commutators can similarly be expressed by gluing together several surfaces .",
    "namely , there are certain finite 2-complexes ( built out of iterated surface stages ) called _ gropes _ by cannon @xcite , with the following defining property : @xmath1 represents an element in the @xmath4-th term of the _ lower central series _ of @xmath3 if and only if it extends to a continuous map of a _ grope of class  @xmath4_. similarly , there are _ symmetric gropes _ which geometrically implement the derived series of @xmath3 , see figures  [ fig : gropes ] and [ fig : symmetric gropes ]    gropes , therefore , are not quite manifolds but the singularities that arise are of a very simple type , so that these 2-complexes are in some sense the next easiest thing after surfaces . two sentences on the history of the use of gropes in mathematics",
    "are in place , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2.11 ) .",
    "their inventor stanko worked in high - dimensional topology , and so did edwards and cannon who developed gropes further .",
    "bob edwards suggested their relevance for topological 4-manifolds , where they were used extensively , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "it is this application that seems to have created a certain  angst  of studying gropes , so we should point out that the only really difficult part in that application is the use of _ infinite constructions _ ,",
    "i.e.  when the class of the grope goes to infinity .    one purpose of this note is to convince the reader that ( finite ) gropes are a very simple , and extremely powerful tool in low - dimensional topology .",
    "the point is that once one can describe iterated commutators in @xmath3 by maps of gropes , one might as well study _ embedded _",
    "gropes in 3-space ( respectively 4-space ) in order to organize knots up to isotopy ( respectively up to concordance ) . in section  [ sec:3d",
    "] we shall explain joint work with jim conant on how gropes embedded in 3-space lead to a geometric interpretation of vassiliev s knot invariants @xcite and of the kontsevich integral @xcite .      in section  [ sec:4d ] we study symmetric gropes embedded in 4-space , and explain how they lead to a geometric framework for",
    "all known knot concordance invariants and beyond .",
    "more precisely , we explain our joint work with tim cochran and kent orr @xcite , where we define new concordance invariants by inductively constructing representations into certain solvable groups @xmath5 , and associating a hermitian form over the group ring @xmath6 to the knot @xmath7 , which is derived from the intersection form of a certain @xmath8-manifold with fundamental group @xmath5 and whose boundary is obtained by @xmath9-surgery on @xmath7 .",
    "this intersection form represents an element in the cappell - shaneson @xmath10-group @xcite of @xmath6 and we detect it via the second transfer from a different area of mathematics : the standard way to detect elements in witt groups like the @xmath10-group above is to construct unitary representations of @xmath5 , and then consider the corresponding ( twisted ) signature of the resulting hermitian form over @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that the solvable groups @xmath5 we construct do not have any interesting finite dimensional representations , basically because they are `` too big '' ( e.g.  not finitely generated ) , a property that is intrinsic to the groups @xmath5 in question because they are `` universal solvable '' in the sense that many @xmath8-manifold groups ( with the right boundary ) must map to @xmath5 , extending the given map of the knot group .",
    "however , every group @xmath5 has a fundamental unitary representation given by @xmath12 , the hilbert space of square summable sequences of group elements with complex coefficients .",
    "the resulting ( weak ) completion of @xmath13 is the _ group von neumann algebra _ @xmath14 .",
    "it is of type  @xmath15 because the map @xmath16 extends from @xmath13 to give a finite faithful trace on @xmath14 .",
    "the punchline is that hermitian forms over the completion @xmath14 are much easier to understand than over @xmath13 because they are diagonalizable ( by functional calculus of self - adjoint operators ) . here",
    "one really uses the von neumann algebra , rather than the @xmath17-algebra completion of @xmath13 because the functional calculus must be applied to the characteristic functions of the positive ( respectively negative ) real numbers , which are bounded but _ not _ continuous .",
    "the subspace on which the hermitian form is positive ( respectively negative ) definite has a _ continuous dimension _ , which is the positive real number given by the trace of the projection onto that subspace . as a consequence",
    ", one can associate to every hermitian form over @xmath14 a real valued invariant , the _ von neumann signature_. in @xcite we use this invariant to construct our new knot concordance invariants , and a survey of this work can be found in section  [ sec:4d ] it is not only related to embedded gropes in 4-space but also to the existence of towers of _ whitney disks _ in 4-space .",
    "unfortunately , we wo nt be able to explain this aspect of the theory , but see ( * ? ? ? * thm.8.12 ) .      in section  [ sec:4d ]",
    "we shall hint at how the interesting representations to our solvable groups are obtained .",
    "but it is well worth pointing out that the methods developed for studying knot concordance have much simpler counterparts in 3-space , i.e.  if one is only interested in isotopy invariants .",
    "a typical list of knot invariants that might find its way into a text book or survey talk on _ classical _ knot theory , would contain the alexander polynomial , ( twisted ) signatures , ( twisted ) arf invariants , and maybe knot determinants .",
    "it turns out that all of these invariants can be computed from the homology of the infinite cyclic covering of the knot complement , and are in this sense `` commutative '' invariants .    instead of the maximal abelian quotient one can use other solvable quotient groups of the knot group to obtain `` noncommutative '' knot invariants .",
    "the canonical candidates are the quotient groups @xmath18 of the derived series @xmath19 of the knot group ( compare section  [ sec:4d ] for the definition ) .",
    "one can thus define the higher order _ alexander modules _ of a knot @xmath7 to be the @xmath20-modules @xmath21 the indexing is chosen so that @xmath22 is the classical alexander module .",
    "for @xmath23 these modules are best studied by introducing further algebraic tools as follows . by a result of strebel",
    "the groups @xmath18 are torsionfree .",
    "therefore , the group ring @xmath24 satisfies the ore condition and has a well defined ( skew ) quotient field .",
    "this field is in fact the quotient field of a ( skew ) polynomial ring @xmath25 $ ] , with @xmath26 the quotient field of @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 .",
    "thus one is exactly in the context of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2 ) and one can define explicit noncommutative isotopy invariants of knots . for example , let @xmath29 be the dimension ( over the field @xmath30 ) of the _ rational _ alexander module @xmath31.\\ ] ] it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.2.11 ) that these dimensions are finite with the degree of the usual alexander polynomial being @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , cochran @xcite has proven the following non - triviality result for these dimensions .",
    "if @xmath7 is a nontrivial knot then for @xmath23 one has @xmath33 moreover , there are examples where these numbers are strictly increasing up to any given @xmath34 .",
    "if one of the inequalities in the above theorem is strict then @xmath7 is not fibered . furthermore ,",
    "@xmath9-surgery on @xmath7 cross the circle is not a symplectic 4-manifold .",
    "the first statement is clear : for fibered knots the degree of the alexander polynomial @xmath32 equals twice the genus of the knot @xmath7 .",
    "the second statement follows from a result of kronheimer @xcite who showed that this equality also holds if the above @xmath8-manifold is symplectic .",
    "recently , harvey @xcite has studied similar invariants for arbitrary @xmath35-manifolds and has proven generalizations of the above results : there are lower bounds for the thurston norm of a homology class , analogous to @xmath36 , that are better than mcmullen s lower bound , which is the analogy of @xmath32 . as a consequence , she gets new algebraic obstructions to a @xmath8-manifold of the form @xmath37 admitting a symplectic structure .",
    "just like in the classical case @xmath38 , there is more structure on the rational alexander modules . by (",
    "* thm.2.13 ) there are higher order _ blanchfield forms _ which are hermitian and non - singular in an appropriate sense , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.12.2 )",
    ". it would be very interesting to know whether the @xmath34-th order blanchfield form determines the von neumann @xmath39-invariant associated to the @xmath40-cover .",
    "so far , these @xmath39-invariants are very mysterious real numbers canonically associated to a knot",
    ".    only in the bottom case @xmath38 do we understand this @xmath39-invariant well : the @xmath41-index theorem implies that the von neumann @xmath39-invariant corresponding to the @xmath42-cover is the von neumann signature of a certain @xmath8-manifold with fundamental group @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , this signature is the integral , over the circle , of all ( levine - tristram ) twisted signatures of the knot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.5.1 ) ( and is thus a concordance invariant ) .",
    "for @xmath23 there is in general no such @xmath8-manifold available and the corresponding @xmath39-invariants are not concordance invariants .",
    "-5 mm    we first give a more precise treatment of the first transfer from group theory to knot theory hinted at in the introduction . recall that the fundamental group consists of continuous maps of the circle @xmath43 into some target space @xmath44 , modulo homotopy ( i.e.@xmath45-parameter families of continuous maps ) .",
    "quite analogously , classical knot theory studies smooth _ embeddings _ of a circle into @xmath46 , modulo isotopy ( i.e.  @xmath45-parameter families of embeddings ) . to explain the transfer",
    ", we recall that a continuous map @xmath1 represents the trivial element in the fundamental group @xmath3 if and only if it extends to a map of the disk , @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 represents a commutator in @xmath3 if and only if it extends to a map of a surface ( i.e.  of a compact oriented 2-manifold with boundary @xmath43 ) .",
    "the first statement has a straightforward analogy in knot theory : @xmath48 is trivial if and only if it extends to an embedding of the disk into @xmath46 . however , every knot `` is a commutator '' in the sense that it bounds a _ seifert surface _ , i.e.  an embedded surface in @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath53 is the genus of the bottom surface and the curves are assumed to span one half of its homology .",
    "this gives gropes of class  @xmath4 with one boundary circle as on the left of figure  [ fig : gropes ] it s not the most general way to get gropes because of re - bracketing issues , and we refer to ( * ? ? ? *",
    "sec.2.1 ) for details .",
    "the boundary of a grope is by definition just the boundary of the bottom surface , compare figure  [ fig : gropes ]    [ def:3d ] two ( smooth oriented ) knots in @xmath46 are _ grope cobordant _ of class  @xmath4 , if there is an embedded grope of class  @xmath4 in @xmath46 ( the _ grope cobordism _ ) such that its boundary consists exactly of the given knots .",
    "an _ embedding _ of a grope is best defined via the obvious @xmath35-dimensional local model .",
    "since every grope has a 1-dimensional spine , embedded gropes can then be isotoped into the neighborhood of a 1-complex . as a consequence ,",
    "embedded gropes abound in 3-space !",
    "it is important to point out that if two knots @xmath54 cobounds a grope then @xmath55 and @xmath56 might very well be linked in a nontrivial way .",
    "thus it is a much stronger condition on @xmath7 to assume that it is the boundary of an embedded grope than to say that it cobounds a grope with the unknot .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 bounds an embedded grope of class  @xmath35 in @xmath46 then the alexander polynomial vanishes .",
    "together with stavros garoufalidis , we recently showed @xcite that the 2-loop term of the kontsevich integral detects many counterexamples to the converse of this statement .    in joint work with jim conant @xcite , we show that grope cobordism defines equivalence relations on knots , one for every class  @xmath57 . moreover , theorem  [ thm:3d ] below implies that the resulting quotients are in fact finitely generated abelian groups ( under the connected sum operation ) .",
    "for the smallest values @xmath58 and 5 , these groups are isomorphic to @xmath59 and they are detected by the first two vassiliev invariants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.4.2 ) .",
    "the following theorem is formulated in terms of _ clasper surgery _ which was introduced independently by habiro @xcite and goussarov @xcite , as a geometric answer to finite type invariants a l vassiliev @xcite .",
    "we can not explain the definitions here but see ( * ? ? ?",

    "we should say that the notion of a _ capped _",
    "grope is well known in 4  dimensions , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.2 ) . in our context , it means that all circles at the `` tips '' of the grope bound disjointly embedded disks in 3-space which are only allowed to intersect the bottom surface of the grope .",

    "moreover , two knots are _ capped _ grope cobordant of class  @xmath4 if and only if they have the same finite type invariants of vassiliev degree  @xmath61 .    as a consequence of this result ,",
    "the invariants associated to grope cobordism are highly nontrivial as well as manageable .",
    "for example , we prove the following result in ( * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , this invariant is rationally faithful and surjective .",
    "here @xmath62 is one of the usual algebras of feynman diagrams known from the theory of finite type invariants , but graded by the _ grope degree_. more precisely , @xmath62 is the @xmath0-vector space generated by connected uni - trivalent graphs of grope degree  @xmath63 , with at least one univalent vertex and a cyclic ordering at each trivalent vertex .",
    "the relations are the usual ihx and as relations .",
    "the grope degree is the vassiliev degree ( i.e.  half the number of vertices ) _ plus _ the first betti number of the graph .",
    "observe that both relations preserve this new degree .",
    "read backwards , our results give an interpretation of the kontsevich integral in terms of the geometrically defined equivalence relations of grope cobordism .",
    "-5 mm    we now turn to the 4-dimensional aspects of the theory .",
    "it may look like the end of the story to realize that any knot with trivial arf invariant bounds a grope of arbitrary big class embedded in @xmath64 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop.3.8 ) .",
    "however , group theory has more to offer than the lower central series . recall that the _ derived series _ of a group @xmath5 is defined inductively by the iterated commutators @xmath65 \\text { and } g^{(h)}:=[g^{(h-1)},g^{(h-1 ) } ]",

    ", satisfying the following defining property : a continuous map @xmath1 represents an element in @xmath66 if and only if it extends to a continuous map of a symmetric grope of height  @xmath67 .",
    "thus a symmetric grope of height  1 is just a surface , and a symmetric grope of height  @xmath67 is obtained from a bottom surface by attaching symmetric gropes of height  @xmath68 to a _ full _ symplectic basis of curves .",
    "this defines symmetric gropes of height  @xmath67 with one boundary circle as in figure  [ fig : symmetric gropes ]        note that a symmetric grope of height  @xmath67 is also a grope of class  @xmath70 , just like in group theory .",
    "but conversely , not every grope is symmetric .",
    "it should also be clear from figure  [ fig : symmetric gropes ] how one defines symmetric gropes with half - integer height ( even though there is no group theoretic analogue ) .    in the following definition we attempt to distinguish the terms `` cobordant '' and `` concordant '' in the sense that the latter refers to 4 dimensions , whereas the former was used in dimension 3 , see definition  [ def:3d ] .",
    "historically , these terms were used interchangeably , but we hope not to create any confusion with our new distinction .    [ def:4d ] two oriented knots in @xmath46 are _ grope concordant _ of height  @xmath71 , if there is an embedded symmetric grope of height  @xmath67 in @xmath72 $ ] such that its boundary consists exactly of the given knots @xmath73 .",
    "observe that since an annulus is a symmetric grope of arbitrary height we indeed get a filtration of the _ knot concordance group_. this group is defined by identifying two knots which cobound an embedded annulus in @xmath72 $ ] , where there are two theories depending on whether the embedding is smooth or just topological ( and locally flat ) . for grope concordance",
    "the smaller topological knot concordance group is the more natural setting : a locally flat topological embedding of a grope ( defined by the obvious local model at the singular points ) can be perturbed to become smooth .",
    "this perturbation might introduce many self - intersection points in the surface stages of the grope .",
    "however , these new singularities are arbitrarily small and thus they can be removed at the expense of increasing the genus of the surface stage in question but without changing the height of the grope .    in joint work with tim cochran and kent orr @xcite , we showed that all known knot concordance invariants fit beautifully into the scheme of grope concordance !",
    "in particular , all known invariants turned out to already be invariants of grope concordance of height  @xmath74 :      1 .",
    "@xmath54 have the same arf invariant if and only if they are grope concordant of height  @xmath75 ( or class  3 ) .",
    "@xmath54 are _ algebraically concordant _ in the sense of levine @xcite ( i.e.  all twisted signatures and twisted arf invariants agree ) if and only if they are grope concordant of height  @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath54 are grope concordant of height  @xmath74 then they have the same casson - gordon invariants @xcite .",
    "the third statement includes the generalizations of casson - gordon invariants by gilmer , kirk - livingston , and letsche . in @xcite",
    "we prove an even stronger version of the third part of theorem  [ thm:4d ] .",
    "namely , we give a weaker condition for a knot @xmath7 to have vanishing casson - gordon invariants : it suffices that @xmath7 is _ @xmath77-solvable_. all the obstruction theory in @xcite is based on the definition of _",
    "@xmath78-solvable _ knots , @xmath71 , which we shall not give here .",
    "suffice it to say that this definition is closer to the algebraic topology of @xmath8-manifolds than grope concordance . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.8.11 ) we show that a knot which bounds an embedded grope of height @xmath79 in @xmath64 is @xmath78-solvable .",
    "it should come as no surprise that the invariants which detect grope concordance have to do with solvable quotients of the knot group .",
    "in fact , the above invariants are all obtained by studying the witt class of the intersection form of a certain @xmath8-manifold @xmath80 whose boundary is obtained by @xmath9-surgery on the knot .",
    "the different cases are distinguished by the fundamental group @xmath81 , namely      so the previously known concordance invariants stopped at solvable groups which are extensions of abelian by abelian groups . to proceed further in the understanding of grope ( and knot ) concordance , one must be able to handle more complicated solvable groups .",
    "a program for that purpose was developed in @xcite by giving an elaborate boot strap argument to construct inductively representations of knot groups into certain _",
    "universal solvable _ groups . on the way , we introduced blanchfield duality pairings in solvable covers of the knot complement by using noncommutative localizations of the group rings in question .",
    "the main idea of the boot strap is that a particular choice of `` vanishing '' of the previous invariant _ defines _ the map into the next solvable group ( and hence the next invariant ) . in terms of gropes",
    "this can be expressed quite nicely as follows : pick a grope concordance of height  @xmath82 and use it to construct a certain @xmath8-manifold whose intersection form gives an obstruction to being able to extend that grope to height  @xmath83 .",
    "there is an obvious technical problem in such an approach , already present in @xcite : to show that there is no grope concordance of height  @xmath83 , one needs to prove non - triviality of the obstruction _ for all _ possible gropes of height  @xmath67 .",
    "one way around this problem is to construct examples where the grope concordances of small height are in some sense unique .",
    "this was done successfully in @xcite for the level above casson - gordon invariants , and in @xcite we even obtain the following infinite generation result .",
    "let @xmath84 be the graded quotient groups of knots , grope concordant of height  @xmath67 to the unknot , modulo grope concordance of height  @xmath83 .",
    "then the results of levine and casson - gordon show that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not finitely generated .",
    "the easiest example of a non - slice knot with vanishing casson - gordon invariants is given in ( * ? ? ? * fig.6.5 ) .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the last step in the proof of theorem  [ thm : cot2 ] is to show that the intersection form of the @xmath8-manifold in question is nontrivial in a certain witt group .",
    "our new tool is the von neumann signature which has the additional bonus that it takes values in @xmath88 , which is not finitely generated as an abelian group .",
    "this fact makes the above result tractable .",
    "we can not review any aspect of the von neumann signature here , but see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.5 ) .",
    "last but not least , it should be mentioned that we now know that for every @xmath82 the groups @xmath84 are nontrivial . this work in progress @xcite uses as the main additional input the cheeger - gromov estimate for von neumann @xmath39-invariants @xcite in order to get around the technical problem mentioned above .",
    "it is very likely that non of the groups @xmath89 are finitely generated ."
