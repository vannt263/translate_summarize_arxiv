    "the detection of a neutrino component in cosmic rays above @xmath1  ev is a central goal of particle astro - physics .",
    "it is generally believed  @xcite that the flux of cosmic ray protons should drop sharply ( `` gzk '' cutoff ) between @xmath1 and @xmath2  ev due to pion photo - production on the microwave background .",
    "recent measurements using the agasa surface array  @xcite and the hires air fluorescence telescope  @xcite seem to disagree on the existence of such a cutoff , although it has been pointed out  @xcite that they may actually be consistent with one another .",
    "neutrinos are likely to be an important component of the particle flux at ultra - high energies .",
    "if the gzk mechanism is indeed present , the flux of ultra - high energy protons must be accompanied by ultra - high energy neutrinos ( `` gzk '' neutrinos ) from pion decay .",
    "their clear detection would provide crucial input to the field .",
    "detection of the very small flux of cosmic rays at these extreme energies requires detectors of unprecedented size .",
    "therefore only detectors employing naturally occurring media are practical .",
    "the parallel development of several different techniques , some of which would ideally employ the same medium , is therefore crucial to constraining the measurements and providing sufficiently accurate and redundant information in order to fully understand cosmic rays at the highest energies .",
    "indeed , in the last few years , great progress has been made in the use of radio signals for the detection of protons and neutrinos using a variety of natural targets , including lunar regolith  @xcite and ice with ground-  @xcite and space - based  @xcite antennas .    in this paper",
    "we describe the first experimental results obtained with the acoustic technique in ocean water .",
    "the possibility of acoustic detection of high - energy particles was first discussed in 1957  @xcite . following this work , an extensive theoretical analysis of the processes relevant to signal formation",
    "was performed  @xcite , and the general phenomenon was confirmed with an accelerator test beam  @xcite . the first description of the properties of a practical , large array for ultra - high - energy neutrino detection was given in  @xcite .",
    "the dominant sound production mechanism , for non - zero water expansivity , consists of water heating in the region where a shower develops ( instantaneously , from the point of view of acoustics ) , followed by expansion , producing a pressure wave . only primaries that penetrate the atmosphere without interacting and then shower in the water are capable of producing detectable acoustic pulses , providing automatic particle identification within a broad range of energies .",
    "acoustic sensor arrays can be substantially more sparse than optical cherenkov arrays in water or ice , because of the large ( @xmath3  km ) attenuation length of sound in water at the frequencies ( @xmath4  khz ) where , for these events , most of the energy lies .",
    "however , as stressed in  @xcite , the elongated shape of the showers produces acoustic interference that results in most of the sound emitted in a pancake - shaped volume with few degrees opening angle .",
    "this effect is important for the optimization of a detector since the optimal density of hydrophones is constrained by the ability to intercept these relatively narrow pancakes .",
    "finally the acoustic technique lends itself well to a calorimetric measurement of the total energy and would complement other technologies well .",
    "saund ( study of acoustic ultra - high energy neutrino detection ) employs a large ( @xmath5  km@xmath6 ) hydrophone array in the u.s .",
    "navy atlantic undersea test and evaluation center ( autec ) .",
    "the array is located in the tongue of the ocean , a deep tract of sea in the bahama islands at approximately @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a detailed description of the entire array is given in  @xcite .",
    "for the present work , we use a subset of seven hydrophones from the large array , arranged in a hexagonal pattern as shown in figure  [ fig:3d_detector ] .",
    "the hydrophones are mounted on 4.5  m booms standing vertically on the ocean floor .",
    "the horizontal spacing between central and peripheral hydrophones is between 1.50  km and 1.57  km .",
    "the ocean floor is fairly flat over the entire array region , with our phones located at depths between 1570  m and 1600  m. the hydrophones and their underwater preamplifiers have been in stable operation for naval exercises since 1969 .",
    "analog signals are amplified at the hydrophones and fed through an on - shore amplifier stage to a digitizer card that continuously samples each of the seven channels at 179  ksamples / s .",
    "the time series in each channel is then fed to a digital matched filter implemented on a 1.7  mhz pentium-4 workstation .",
    "ultra - high energy neutrinos interact with matter by deep inelastic scattering on quarks inside nuclei . with increasing energy , the interaction cross - section  @xcite , and hence the probability of a neutrino interacting within the ocean water ( which is thinner than the @xmath9  km interaction length at 10@xmath10 ev ) , increases . after the primary interaction ,",
    "the neutrino energy is distributed between a quark and a lepton . on average",
    ", the lepton acquires @xmath1180% of the energy  @xcite .",
    "the remaining energy is dumped into the water as a hadronic shower aligned with the direction of the primary neutrino .",
    "the water is heated locally , causing it to expand and emit an acoustic pulse propagating perpendicular to the shower axis .",
    "while a muon or tau neutrino generates only a hadronic shower , an electron neutrino also generates an electromagnetic shower , which is superimposed on the hadronic one .",
    "however , due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect  @xcite , the electromagnetic shower is elongated and has an irregular structure , producing weaker acoustic signals with irregular geometries .",
    "here we only consider the hadronic showers , which exhibit the same structure for all kinds of neutrinos and are simulated with a simple parametrization as modeled in  @xcite .",
    "this model includes @xmath12 interactions and the lpm effect for the electromagnetic components of the hadronic shower . once the energy deposition has been determined using this shower model , the resulting acoustic pulse shape is simulated , following  @xcite , at arbitrary positions ( @xmath13 ) with respect to the shower .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : neutrino_signals ] for a fixed radial distance from the shower , the bipolar pulse is tallest and narrowest in a plane perpendicular to the shower axis , at the longitudinal location of the shower maximum . was used instead of the correct value of @xmath14 .",
    "this resulted in a simulated signal amplitude larger than the correct value by a factor of 8 .",
    "this error is corrected in the present work . ]",
    "the pulse becomes shorter and wider at greater longitudinal distances from the maximum .",
    "the general features of the pulse shape match the data from  @xcite .    triggering is achieved in saund with a digital matched filter that searches for signals matching the expected neutrino signal , appropriately weighting frequency components according to their signal - to - noise ratio  @xcite .",
    "the filter response function is obtained by transforming to the frequency domain the expected signal shape , which is approximated in the time domain by the analytical form @xmath15 .",
    "the characteristic time of the signal depends on position @xmath16 relative to the shower ( see figure  [ fig : neutrino_signals ] ) .",

    "the expected @xmath21 is approximated with @xmath22 for analytical convenience .",
    "the transfer function @xmath23 is then transformed to the time domain to obtain the response function , @xmath24 e^{-t^2/{2\\tau^2}}.\\ ] ]    each channel is continuously filtered and the filter output is compared to a threshold .",
    "the filter is implemented with a discretized version of the above response function , sampled at the same frequency as the pressure waveforms ( 179 khz ) .",
    "12 samples ranging from @xmath25s to @xmath26s are used . beyond this range",
    ", the response function is below 13% of its peak amplitude .",
    "when the threshold is exceeded , a trigger occurs and event data are recorded .",
    "signals from the highest - energy neutrinos considered here are expected to saturate the digitizer , and @xmath27 of waveforms in the dataset are saturated . by simulating the effects of saturation on the digital filter and on subsequent offline cuts , we found that saturation does not pose a problem to the present analysis .",
    "this is because the cuts rely primarily on frequency and timing information , not on amplitude .    by arrangement with the u.s .",
    "navy , the saund data acquisition system ( daq ) is connected to the hydrophone array only when the array is not in use for navy exercises .",
    "the live time achieved under this agreement is shown in figure  [ fig : livetime ] .",
    "as shown in the top panel , a test run ( run a ) was used to commission the system and is not used for the present analysis .",
    "the system was upgraded from oct .",
    "2001 to dec . 2001 and run for an integrated 147 days live with stable conditions ( run b ) .",
    "only this stable run is used for the analysis presented here .",
    "the solid curve in the bottom panel shows the live time achieved at different times of day .",
    "the live time is close to 100% at night , when no navy tests are conducted , and it drops to about 70% in the middle of the day .",
    "the average over a day is @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , an overall live time reduction due to weather conditions and hardware failures resulted in the dashed line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : livetime ] .    because the noise environment is volatile",
    ", an adaptive trigger threshold is used .",
    "every minute the threshold is raised or lowered based on whether the number of events in the previous minute was above or below the target rate of 60  events / minute .",
    "events are accumulated in memory each minute and written to disk , along with data relevant to the entire minute , at the end of the minute .",
    "the distribution of thresholds in run b is shown in figure  [ fig : quiet_livetime ] . to simplify online processing and offline event reconstruction , the threshold value",
    "is constrained to discrete values ( integer multiples of 0.004 , in units of digital filter output ) . for the purpose of neutrino analysis , only thresholds between 0.012 and 0.024 are used .",
    "these `` quiet '' periods account for 37% of run b.    in total , run b contains 20  m triggers ( 250  gb ) corresponding to @xmath111.7  gb / day .",
    "every few weeks , data are transferred to an external hard drive that is shipped to stanford for offline analysis .",
    "nine - tenths of the triggers are captured for 1  ms ; one - tenth are captured for 10  ms in order to record and study reflections from the ocean bottom .",
    "the frequency response of the hydrophone / amplifiers chain is flat to better than 8  db between 7.5  khz and 50  khz .",
    "a sharp cutoff of 100  db / octave below 7.5  khz is due to an analog high pass filter in the system , while a somewhat slower roll - off , due to the sensor itself , occurs above 50  khz . the low frequency cutoff , while not ideal for neutrino detection , is not a significant hindrance .",
    "the phase response of the hydrophone / amplifiers chain is difficult to measure and at present is not well known . in order to gain some quantitative understanding of its possible effects on the trigger",
    ", the efficiency of the filter was calculated for the pulse shapes in figure  [ fig : neutrino_signals ] and for their first and second time derivatives , after applying a 9th - order butterworth bandpass filter to mimic the autec frequency response . for each of these phase responses",
    ", efficiency was calculated as a function of energy .",
    "the resulting trigger thresholds have a spread of a factor of two for any given energy .",
    "conservatively , the highest of these thresholds is assumed in the present analysis .",
    "in addition to the matched filter described above , an online veto is applied to remove a specific kind of noise that is time - correlated in all channels .",
    "this noise consists of simultaneous sinusoids in all 7 channels , occurring in bursts with a 60  hz repetition rate .",
    "while the origin of these signals is unknown , it is clear that they originate from electrical pickup , because the sound velocity does not allow for simultaneous , correlated acoustic events in all phones .",
    "the veto removes this noise by rejecting events with large 7-channel pairwise correlation , @xmath29 where the time sum is taken over discrete samples and @xmath30 is the pressure time series at phone @xmath31 , normalized by mean absolute amplitude : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the absolute pressure and @xmath34 is its average over the captured waveform .",
    "events with @xmath35 are removed .",
    "every 10 minutes , time series for all channels are collected for 100  ms in forced mode .",
    "these data are used for offline noise analysis and for simulating the noise conditions in our efficiency calculation .",
    "every minute the noise spectrum is calculated from a 100  ms - long time series .",
    "a typical noise spectrum is given in figure  [ fig : noise_spectrum ] .",
    "saund run b provides the largest data set ever collected for the purpose of studying acoustic techniques in uhe particle detection . during the run it has been our strategy to collect data with consistent and stable conditions for an extended period of time .",

    "a calibration run of this type was performed on the morning of july 30 , 2001 ( at the beginning of run a ) .    the small boat used for the calibration",
    "was positioned over the central hydrophone using a handheld global positioning system ( gps ) receiver .",
    "the boat engine was then turned off and several light bulbs were sunk as the vessel drifted for about thirty minutes .",
    "two more gps fixes were acquired during the calibration .",
    "the waveforms recorded for one of the implosion events are shown in figure  [ fig : bulb_all_phones ] .",
    "the first pulse corresponds to the direct acoustic signal arriving at the central hydrophone .",
    "the pulse around 0.2  s corresponds to the arrival at the hydrophone of the signal reflected by the surface of the ocean .",
    "direct pulses in all other six hydrophones appear between 0.4  s and 0.5  s , followed , in turn , by the respective surface reflections . in figure",

    "the difference in arrival times between each pair of hydrophones constrains the source location to a hyperboloid .",
    "four hydrophones ( three independent time differences ) are necessary to determine three hyperboloids , the intersection of which can be found analytically and generally results in two points .",
    "for our sea - floor , planar array , the two solutions are usually symmetric about the detector plane , and the solution below the sea floor can be discarded .    while an analytical tdoa solution is possible in homogeneous media , the ocean is not homogeneous but is a layered medium . at autec",

    "the minimization begins at the best grid point , and the grid is linearly interpolated to find the off - grid source location .",
    "the grid is built once , and the interpolation then occurs for each event reconstruction .",
    "while the local sound velocity profile ( svp ) is measured almost daily by the navy and is available to us , it was found that seasonal svp variations introduce errors smaller than those due to the uncertainty in the hydrophone location .",

    "these coincidences are presumably accidental and are therefore discarded .",
    "most of the 79 events remaining in our data set have `` multipolar '' waveforms at more than one of the 5 phones triggered .",

    "for each energy @xmath87 simulated neutrino events are produced with random orientations and positions in a water cylinder of radius 5  km , centered around the central phone .",

    "outside of this region , however , the rays reach vertical turning points and precise source localization becomes difficult .",
    "for this reason , we conservatively limit the fiducial volume to 5  km radius .",
    "the requirement that the radiation pancake intercepts several hydrophones almost coplanar with the sea floor forces the direction of the accepted neutrinos to be close to the vertical .",
    "the uncertainty in source position reconstruction , estimated from monte carlo data , worsens steadily with distance outside the array , but it does not exceed 500  m ( vertical ) and 200  m ( horizontal ) for radial distances smaller than 5  km .",

    "the expected pancake shape of the acoustic emission profile from neutrinos is an essential assumption of this assertion .",
    "focusing effects can potentially alter the detected energy and hence the threshold value .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : focusing ] , such focusing effects are small for sources in the neutrino fiducial volume and are neglected .    in order to express this result as an upper limit to the ultra high energy neutrino flux",
    ", we define a fiducial volume given by the revolution of the dashed triangle around the vertical axis .",
    "the fiducial region is chosen to be slightly above the ocean floor in order not to be affected by floor roughness .",
    "ideally , the fiducial volume choice would have been based entirely on the signal monte carlo events",
    ". however , given the novelty of the technique and the present emphasis on studying backgrounds , such a `` blind '' approach is impractical here .",
    "the separation between expected neutrino region and observed coincidences is nevertheless striking enough that the definition of the fiducial volume is unambiguous .",
    "in fact , the main source of uncertainty in our analysis lies in the assumptions made about the phase response of the array .",
    "no 5-phone coincidences are present in saund run b within the fiducial volume .    from the geometrical acceptance @xmath98 defined above ,",
    "a `` neutrino exposure '' @xmath99 is computed . here",
    "@xmath100 is the avogadro number , @xmath101 is the neutrino cross section and @xmath102 is the live time for a particular value of the adaptive threshold , labeled by @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath103 is estimated by extrapolating the power - law fit given for energies between 10@xmath104  ev and 10@xmath10  ev in  @xcite .",
    "fits for neutrinos are used , the anti - neutrino fits being very similar .",
    "exposures collected at different thresholds are then added together . a 90% cl flux limit",
    "is then calculated following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite using poisson s statistics and the fact that no events are observed .",
    "the resulting limit ( multiplied by @xmath105 , as customary ) is shown in figure  [ fig : flux_limits ] along with the limits already available from forte  @xcite , rice  @xcite and glue  @xcite , and with fluxes predicted by various theories  @xcite .",
    "while the main motivation of this work has been to gain operational experience and investigate acoustic backgrounds for uhe neutrino detection , a flux measurement was obtained from the data .",
    "although the limit , shown in figure  [ fig : flux_limits ] , is not competitive with the best limits ( obtained with radio techniques ) it represents the first uhe neutrino measurement performed with acoustic techniques .",
    "a wealth of information on noise conditions and the possible methods available to separate such noise from the neutrino signals has been obtained . here",
    "we briefly discuss the characteristics of the saund array that turned out to be sub - optimal for uhe neutrino detection , and we describe some of the properties that an optimized acoustic neutrino array should have .",
    "the importance of calibrating the phase response of the acoustic array can not be overstated .",
    "without such a calibration , it is expected that the unknown phase properties of the readout will dominate the systematics of the measurement .",
    "an artificial source capable of providing acoustic signals similar to those from neutrinos with energies in the range considered here can be realized by discharging a capacitor in a column of sea water of length similar to that of a uhe shower .",
    "the instantaneous heating of the water should closely simulate the heating produced by showers , releasing an acoustic wave with the correct pancake geometry and phase / frequency structure .",
    "the flatness of the acoustic radiation lobes from uhe showers is a crucial feature that allows noise rejection but also drastically limits the acceptance of saund .",
    "refraction exacerbates the problem , by making regions of sea invisible to the array and by curving the emission pancake into a shape that often has little overlap with a planar hydrophone array .",
    "the planar geometry of the saund array is also poorly optimized to provide good position resolution in the direction orthogonal to the plane .",
    "the vertical resolution is estimated to be as poor as 400  m for sources deeper than 1400  m , while it is 10  m for sources close to the surface .",
    "the resolution in the horizontal plane , however , is better than 10  m in most of the volume",
    ". a hydrophone array on a 3d lattice would provide substantially larger acceptance and superior pancake - shape identification .",
    "although the long attenuation length of sound in water allows for large ( several hundred meters to several kilometers ) horizontal spacing for an optimized neutrino detector , to overcome the flatness of the acoustic radiation an array with dense ( @xmath106  m ) vertical spacing is necessary .",
    "even better , the ideal array would consist not of strings of discrete modules , but of strings sensitive to acoustic signals uniformly along their entire length .",
    "such a detector element is not inconceivable and could perhaps be realized with a tube of fluid of sound speed different from the surrounding water , attached to hydrophones on each end .",
    "when an acoustic signal intercepts the tube , the difference in sound speeds leads to a signal propagating in both directions along the tube .",
    "the difference in arrival times at the two hydrophones could be used to localize the intersection point .",
    "other possibilities may include interferometers built with an optical fiber running along the length of the string ( although is it not clear how this could vertically localize signals ) .    to explore the possible sensitivity of an array of such strings with dense vertical spacing ,",
    "two hypothetical arrays were tested with monte carlo neutrinos . both are hexagonal lattices of 367 1.5  km - long strings .",
    "the first ( `` a '' ) has 500  m nearest - neighbor spacing and is bounded by a circle of radius @xmath107  km drawn about the central string .",
    "the second ( `` b '' ) has 5  km spacing and is bounded by an @xmath108  km circle .",
    "both are taken to have a fiducial volume given by a cylinder of height 1.5  km and radius @xmath109  km .",
    "circles of various radii representing acoustic radiation from neutrinos of various energies were generated throughout this fiducial volume , with zenith from 0 to @xmath110/2 .",
    "the calculated sensitivity of these arrays , requiring 5 strings hit , is given in figure  [ fig : flux_limits ] .    while water is the first medium to be tested for acoustic neutrino detection , salt ( available in naturally - occurring multi - km@xmath111 underground domes ) and ice ( available near the poles in multi - km deep sheets )",
    "may be more favorable . in polar ice",
    "as compared with ocean water , noise is expected to be significantly lower , and signals are predicted to be greater by an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the hypothetical configurations `` a '' and `` b '' above , implemented in ice , possibly with more advanced triggering schemes in which thresholds are lowered for a time window after the first sensor is hit , may allow for better sensitivity at lower energy .",
    "tests are necessary in these media to determine their merit . in any",
    "case acoustic detection could be employed in combination with radio and optical cherenkov techniques to provide more complete information about the very rare events occurring at the highest energies .",
