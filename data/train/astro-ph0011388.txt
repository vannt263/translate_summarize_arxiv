    "from iue spectra of the yz cas primary , [ lm83 ] found that the metals add up to a z value of over 0.03 ( z@xmath30.036@xmath40.005 ) .",
    "we try to assess to what extent this high z - value has to be revised .",
    "it is well known that the abundance of iron is enhanced in am stars with respect to normal a - f stars .",
    "[ lm83 ] found for yz cas a that fe is @xmath56 times overabundant , which implies that fe contributes to @xmath543% of z. in order to update the [ lm83 ] study , we applied two corrections to this value : 1 ) they assumed an iron solar abundance a@xmath6@xmath37.60 .",
    "more detailed studies give a@xmath6 @xmath3 7.50@xmath40.05 ( [ gs99 ] ) implying that fe contributes to @xmath557% of z. 2 ) their analysis assumed t@xmath7@xmath310,300k .",
    "recent determinations give 9100@xmath4300k ( [ r00 ] ) .",
    "this would reduce the [ lm83 ] s iron abundance by about 0.15 - 0.20 dex , and then imply that fe contributes to @xmath533% of z. both corrections are opposite and imply altogether that fe contributes to @xmath540% of z. hence , our attempt to update some of the [ lm83 ] assumptions does not change their high - z conclusion .",
    "since @xmath8 strmgren colours are available for both components of yz cas ( [ l81 ] , [ j97 ] ) , it is possible to derive [ fe / h ] from existing calibrations .",
    "the [ j97 ] photometric indices do not suggest a metallic behaviour of the am star atmosphere : [ fe / h ] is @xmath90.02@xmath40.22 ( [ j00 ] ) , i.e z@xmath30.017@xmath10 ( assuming z@xmath0@xmath30.018 ) .",
    "the upper limit is only marginally compatible with the z derived from the iue spectra . assuming the individual photometric indices from [ l81 ] , the derived atmospheric [ fe / h ] is 0.12@xmath40.05 , i.e. z@xmath30.024@xmath40.003 , again only marginally compatible with the iue determination . using strmgren photometry from [ j97 ] and",
    "accurate gravities , [ l99 ] derived simultaneous t@xmath7-[fe / h ] estimates from the basel photometric calibrations ( [ l98 ] ) .",
    "they obtain [ fe / h ] strictly lower than 0.1 for yz cas a , i.e z@xmath110.022 .",
    "this result assumes no reddening which is justified by experiments we performed with the basel models ( see [ l99 ] for details on the method ) for e(b@xmath9y ) ranging from @xmath90.034 ( _ negative _ value of [ l81 ] ) to 0.09 ( maximum value quoted by [ lm83 ] ) . in summary , even if the results of [ j00 ] and [ l99 ] are not completely independent because based on the same colour indices , they suggest that the atmospheric metallicity of yz cas a is solar or sub - solar , and exclude z - values greater than 0.03 .      de landtsheer a.c .",

    "<S> the derivation of z from iue spectra , as well as from photometric indices , provides the chemical composition of the atmosphere ( z@xmath1 ) , while the fit of evolutionary tracks provides the initial chemical composition ( z@xmath2 ) . while a disagreement is expected between z@xmath1 and z@xmath2 because the primary component is an am star ( one expects z@xmath1 to be larger ) , we find some unexpected discrepancy between atmospheric determinations of z for this star . </S>"
