    "strongly - correlated models of the cuo@xmath2 planes of high - t@xmath3 superconductors continue to attract much attention due to the belief that most of the physics in the cuprates is governed by strongly interacting , purely electronic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "microscopic studies of hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath4 models have been successful in explaining the @xmath5-wave character of the pairing mechanism @xcite and other experimental results , such as narrow low - energy bands in the angle - resolved photoemission for the undoped systems .",
    "@xcite more recent interest in these models has been boosted by the discovery of stripes , or spin and charge inhomogeneities , in high - t@xmath3 materials.@xcite generally , the strongly correlated @xmath0-@xmath4 and hubbard models in the non - perturbative regime ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) are difficult to approach analytically , although some advances have been achieved in solving them .",
    "because of this , numerical methods have been responsible for much of the progress in the understanding of these models.@xcite moreover , such numerical studies have become a very important test of the ability of theoretical approaches to describe the stripe and other low - energy phases@xcite in cuprates .",
    "while the striped phase was anticipated from mean - field solutions of the hubbard model@xcite , probably the most convincing evidence of stripe - like ground states has been provided by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies of the @xmath0-@xmath4 model in large clusters in the range of parameters relevant to real systems.@xcite however , some other numerical approaches raise the question that the stripes seen in dmrg might be the result of finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "another aspect of the problem is that numerical studies alone do not directly answer questions on the origin of stripes .",
    "ideally , one would wish for a theory which would closely agree with the numerical data on all essential aspects , thus providing a definite physical answer on how the stripes are created and what are the excitations around this state .",
    "the search for such a case has motivated our present work and that is the way we unify our approaches here.@xcite    in this work we attempt to integrate some of the earlier ideas on the @xmath0-@xmath4 model physics with the newer trends and phenomenology which have appeared due to stripes .",
    "we approach the problem using a comparative study of the stripe in an antiferromagnetic insulator by dmrg and an analytical technique , within the framework of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "our numerical study utilizes dmrg in large @xmath8 clusters of up to @xmath9 sites , using various boundary conditions .",
    "the analytical method is a self - consistent green s function technique developed earlier@xcite , which accounts for the retraceable - path motion of the holes away from stripe .",
    "we demonstrate that the stripe in an antiferromagnet ( af ) should be viewed as a system of composite holon - spin - polaron excitations condensed at the self - induced antiphase domain wall adw .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath4 model has long been seen as a natural model for the description of the charges and spins in a doped af @xcite .",
    "the single- and two - hole problems within the model have been studied extensively using different analytical schemes and numerical approaches in small clusters @xcite . some attempts to generalize the conclusions of these studies on the nature of the many - hole ground - state",
    "have also been made @xcite .",
    "very good agreement between the numerical and analytical studies for these problems has been achieved within the spin - polaron paradigm @xcite .",
    "this essentially quasiparticle picture describes the single - hole excitation as a hole strongly dressed by the `` string''-like spin excitations .",
    "it was found that two such quasiparticles tend to form a bound - state of @xmath5-wave symmetry.@xcite the generic reason for the absence of the @xmath10-wave pairing is the magnon - mediated exchange which generates a repulsion in the @xmath10-wave channel .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath0-@xmath4 model , vertex corrections are suppressed @xcite and such a repulsion is strong .",
    "then the attraction in higher - order harmonics leads to the bound states of higher symmetry@xcite .",
    "attempts to integrate out the spin background and to reformulate the @xmath0-@xmath4 model as an effective model for quasiparticles with a narrow band ( @xmath11 ) and an interaction repulsive in the @xmath10-wave channel and attractive in the @xmath5-wave channel have been made , @xcite assuming the antiferromagnetic correlation length to be the largest scale in the problem .",
    "phase separation in such a model in a physical range @xmath12 seems to be unlikely since the pair - pair interaction should also be repulsive , which agrees with the numerical data @xcite .",
    "the ground state in this model would be a dilute `` gas '' of @xmath5-wave spin - polaron pairs .",
    "such a generalization of the spin - polaron picture to a finite concentration of holes relies on the assumption that the antiferromagnetic background remains unchanged .",
    "however , it is well known that the `` feedback '' effect of holes on the antiferromagnetic background is important . aside from hartree - fock treatments of the hubbard model @xcite which showed stripe - like domain wall solutions , other studies of the @xmath0-@xmath4 model in the low - doping regime have indicated instabilities of the antiferromagnetic order.@xcite these instabilities were thought to lead towards spiral@xcite , stripe - like spiral@xcite , or spin - liquid@xcite states . earlier numerical works in the small @xmath0-@xmath4 clusters , ref .  [ ] , have demonstrated stripes in the ground state which were also domain walls in the nel af . with the mounting evidence from experiments@xcite and from dmrg numerical data@xcite the idea of _ topological _ doping@xcite has flourished .",
    "the spontaneously created adw s have been widely considered as the topological alternatives to the homogeneous nel background.@xcite    thus , the many - hole ground state has turned out to be very different from that for a few holes . in order to understand the nature of the charge excitations in this phase one needs to reconsider the single - particle problem around this ground state with different topology.@xcite",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) character of the charge stripes has led to a number of attempts to generalize the physics of strictly 1d systems , where the excitations are holons and spinons , to higher dimensions.@xcite on the other hand , there is a growing understanding that the stripes are the outcome of the same tendencies which are seen already for the single - hole problem@xcite , and that the charge excitations in the stripe phase may still have lots in common with the spin polarons.@xcite    note that topological doping generally refers to the introduction of dopants into the topological defects of a field theory , which are the field configurations that interpolate between different vacua of the problem . for problems with high symmetry , such as the @xmath13 heisenberg model ,",
    "topological defects are continuous distortions of the order parameter.@xcite the adw s are the topological defects for systems with lower @xmath14 symmetry , such as the ising or the anisotropic @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( and also models for polyacetylene@xcite ) . while the magnetism in cuprates is very well described by the @xmath13 symmetric models@xcite the experimental finding of stripes indicate that topological doping corresponds to topological defects of lower symmetry .",
    "although the reason for this lowering of the symmetry is , most probably , dynamical in nature and is still not clearly understood , it gives us confidence that the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is the right starting point for the description of these systems .",
    "as long as one is concerned with the short - range physics of the charge and spin excitations , the isotropic @xmath13 @xmath0-@xmath4 and anisotropic @xmath0-@xmath1 models lead to similar results , as is well known from earlier studies.@xcite roughly , the hole motion is fast and the spin relaxation is slow when @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in the fast timescale the hole moves in the background of essentially static , staggered spins",
    ". we will show below that the stripe phases obtained numerically for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model are virtually identical to those in the @xmath0-@xmath4 model studied before.@xcite it has also been concluded , based on the ginzburg - landau functional approach , that the antiphase shift of the antiferromagnetic order parameter must originate from some short - range physics.@xcite the rigidity of the @xmath15-shift of the antiferromagnetic phase across the domain wall in both numerical and experimental studies also argues for the short - range genesis of the stripes .    in this paper",
    "we , therefore , study analytically and numerically the system of holes at the adw in the anisotropic @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "while we restrict ourselves to the study of the strongly anisotropic limit of the basic @xmath0-@xmath4 model , we believe that the results of our study are much more generic since the strongly correlated nature of the problem is preserved .",
    "technically , switching off the transverse spin fluctuation has numerical and analytical advantages .",
    "the numerical advantages are twofold .",
    "first , the sizes of the system which can be handled by the dmrg method are considerably bigger .",
    "second , one can think of the boundary conditions as a way of stabilizing ground states of different symmetries . in our case",
    "the choice would be between the state with and the state without an adw .",
    "then , one can consequently dope holes in the stripe ( adw ) configuration and study the evolution of the properties of the system as a function of doping , starting from a very dilute limit .",
    "it is worth noting the boundary conditions in our case work as a very gentle instrument of controlling the symmetry of the ground state _ without _ affecting the wave - functions of the states themselves .",
    "the analytical advantage is the treatability of the problem .",
    "the analytical part of this work largely relies on a previous study by two of us and bishop , ref .",
    "[ ] , where we have calculated the green s function of the charge excitation at the adw by a method which goes beyond the limits of mean - field or perturbation theory .",
    "the general conclusion of the present study is that the stripe should be considered as a collective bound state of the holes with an adw .",
    "in such a system the excitations are composite holon - spin - polarons which populate an effective 1d band .",
    "this picture is in very good agreement with the numerical results and provides insight into the problem of the stripe phase in cuprates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ analytics ] describes various aspects of our analytical approach in detail .",
    "section [ numerics ] describes the dmrg method .",
    "section [ results ] presents the results and comparison .",
    "section [ conclusions ] lists our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the @xmath0-@xmath1 model which is given by : @xmath16\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the kinetic energy , @xmath4 is the antiferromagnetic exchange , and @xmath17 .",
    "all operators are defined in the space without double - occupancy of the sites .    the single - hole problem for the @xmath0-@xmath4 ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) model in a homogeneous antiferromagnetic background",
    "is well studied with analytical results and numerical data being in very good agreement @xcite .",
    "the charge quasiparticle is understood as a spin polaron , i.e. a hole dressed by strings of spin excitations @xcite .",
    "it is also often expressed as that the hole movement in a homogeneous antiferromagnetic background is frustrated because of the tail of misaligned spins following the hole , see fig .",
    "[ fig_0 ] .",
    "the idea that an adw can be a more favorable configuration for holes relies on the fact that such a frustration of the hole s kinetic energy can be avoided for a movement inside the wall , such that the hole is essentially free in the 1d structure .",
    "however , as we show below , the spin - polaron aspect of the physics of the charge carrier remains very important in the stripe phase as well .",
    "we will first consider the specifics of the hole behavior in the inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic state ( state with an adw ) and will address the spin - polaron aspect of the problem later . for the detailed description of the spin - polaron formalism used in this work we refer to ref .",

    "let us consider the empty system first .",
    "the ground state is , of course , given by the simple nel configuration of spins , fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) . however , when the antiphase shift of the staggered magnetization is created ( enforced by the boundary conditions , for instance ) the straight bond - centered domain wall is the lowest energy state , fig . [ fig_1](b ) .",
    "it has the energy @xmath21 per unit length , which is lower , for example , than the corresponding energy for the site - centered domain wall , @xmath22 .",
    "we remark here that the @xmath13 heisenberg spins would prefer a continuous untwist from one end of the crystal to the other without a sharp domain wall .",
    "now let us consider a single hole doped to the system .",
    "when the kinetic energy is neglected ( @xmath23 ) the lowest energy state is defined from simple bond counting .",
    "evidently , the hole is attracted to the domain wall since the potential energy ( @xmath4-term ) is lowered when the hole removes the `` wrong '' bond , fig .",

    "line can be considered as an ising chain .",
    "arcs denote `` wrong '' ( ferromagnetic ) bonds.,height=192 ]    when the kinetic energy is taken into consideration the following observation can be made .",
    "if one restricts the hole motion to one side of the adw `` ladder '' of defects ( along the @xmath24-axes , @xmath25 is fixed at @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) the problem is identical to the hole motion in the 1d ising chain.@xcite that is , one can see that after the first step a 1d spin defect ( spinon ) is created and then the motion of the hole does not cause any further disturbance in the spin background , figs .",
    "[ fig_2](a , b ) .",
    "the hole simply rearranges the `` wrong '' bonds while moving .",
    "since the charge does not carry any `` memory '' about the spin of the place where it was created this excitation is a holon .",
    "notably , when the spinon and holon are separated , they both carry a `` kink '' or `` anti - kink '' of the staggered magnetic order ; in other words , they are zero - dimensional adws in the 1d chain problem , fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "it is more visually convenient to use staggered magnetization @xmath20 instead of the on - site magnetization to emphasize the opposite direction of the order parameter in the antiferromagnetic domains of spins .",
    "we , therefore , will often use `` @xmath18 '' or `` @xmath19 '' instead of the actual direction of the spin .    '' and `` @xmath19 '' represent the sign of the staggered magnetization.,width=288 ]    since the spinon in our case is a finite - energy excitation ( @xmath27 ) , in the @xmath28 limit the hole will be always bound to its site of origin .",
    "one can think of several possibilities to avoid the spinon creation in order to focus on the properties of the charge excitation only .",
    "one can ( _ i _ ) assume that the crystal is finite ( semi - finite ) and create a hole at one of the ends of the chain , then the propagation of the holon along the chain is free , ( _ ii _ ) create a pair of holes at the nearest neighbor sites and then consider their motion independently , in this case both the kink and anti - kink are carried by holons , and ( _ iii _ ) start with the empty domain wall with a `` wiggle '' , one half of it misplaced by one lattice spacing from the other half along the @xmath25-axis .",
    "this way one has an extra `` wrong '' bond in it , fig .",
    "[ fig_5](a ) , which is equivalent to having a 1d chain along the @xmath29 line with the single spinon",
    ". then the hole creation at one of the sites forming the spinon is identical to the creation of a free holon , figs .",
    "[ fig_5](b , c ) .",
    "the purpose of these manipulations is to show that the single hole motion along the adw can be made free provided that the spin environment ensures the holonic nature of the charge excitation .",
    "these considerations are by no means new and were discussed in refs .",
    "we suggest calling the free motion of the hole within the stripe a `` prepared - path '' motion in accord with the `` retraceable - path '' motion for the spin polaron .",
    "1.5 cm   1.5 cm     as it follows from the above consideration , the wave - function of the single holon can not be simply written as a result of an action of a single annihilation operator on some unique ground - state wave - function , since it requires a rearrangement of the ( semi- ) infinite amount of spins .",
    "however , if the ground - state is `` prepared '' , as in the case ( _ iii _ ) , one can still keep the formal similarity with the conventional single - particle creation .",
    "in other words , if the holon is to be created at the site @xmath30 , its wave - function can be written as : @xmath31 where the hilbert space at each site is restricted to single occupancy , @xmath32 , @xmath33 if @xmath34 sublattice , @xmath35 is the vacuum state , `` @xmath18 '' and `` @xmath19 '' denote the domains with staggered magnetization `` up '' and `` down '' , respectively .",
    "this definition suffices for our consideration .",
    "the above mentioned `` restriction '' of the hole motion along the adw can be formally expressed as a separation of the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian ( [ h_tj ] ) in two pieces : @xmath36 where the first term ( `` longitudinal '' ) includes only 1d motion along @xmath24-axis for @xmath29 , and the second term ( `` transverse '' ) includes the rest . evidently , @xmath37 and thus @xmath38 where latexmath:[\\ ] ] where we drop the spin index for clarity .",
    "one can see that the matrix elements between different `` strings '' are essential . for the details of calculations of @xmath112 in the @xmath0-@xmath4 model we refer to the earlier works , refs .",
    "as an example of the calculation of the discussed quantities we show our results for @xmath122 , eq .",
    "( [ n_x ] ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig_9b ] for @xmath49 .",
    "this quantity shows the hole density modulation in the direction perpendicular to the stripe within the @xmath82-eigenstate in the 1d band for different momenta @xmath82 .",
    "one can see that at the momenta away from the bottom of the band the hole is mostly spread around the stripe .",
    "further results on these and other quantities are given in the context of the comparison with the numerical data , sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "there are few other issues we would like to address here .",
    "first , if one is to start from the strictly 1d stripe and is to gradually `` relax '' the initial restriction for the hole to be kept in such a 1d chain , how soon does one reach the `` true '' eigenvalue of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian ?",
    "that is , let us allow the `` bare '' holon to have an admixture of strings of length @xmath123 and see when the results converge and become independent of @xmath117 .",
    "figure [ fig_12 ] shows the energy bands for such `` restricted - string - length '' problems .",
    "@xmath124 corresponds to a free holon , fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are for the cases where the `` strings '' of length 1 and 2 are included in the approximation .",
    "@xmath127 is our answer from eqs .",
    "( [ g])-([s1 ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] .",
    "@xmath82 for `` strings '' with @xmath128 included in the wave function.,width=288 ]        this comparison demonstrates one more time that the `` bare '' , or almost `` bare '' 1d excitation with some admixture of the `` transverse fluctuations '' is certainly not a good approximation for the description of the stripe charge excitation .",
    "it is especially true for the finite concentrations where large momenta around @xmath129 are most important .    as an alternative starting approximation",
    "we argue , once again , for the picture of a holon strongly coupled to the `` bulk '' spin - polaron excitation , fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] . the dispersion obtained without renormalization of the spin - polaron propagator in fig .",
    "[ fig_8](b ) is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_13 ] , which is already very close to the result where such a renormalization is taken into account ( solid line , from fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the second issue is the following .",
    "since there are two types of kinks in the system ( kink and anti - kink ) which can be associated with the pure holonic excitation , fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , one can have two different `` species '' of excitations having opposite `` geometrical '' quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "one may then think of them as essentially independent particles populating ( quasi- ) independent bands .",
    "a little thinking brings such a logic into a paradox : the case when the chain is completely filled ( all sites are occupied by holes ) in this language will correspond to two half - filled ( conducting ? ) bands of different `` flavor '' .",
    "one resolves the paradox by noting that these `` extra '' quantum numbers should not lead to the increase of the total number of states in the system . in our case there",
    "can not be more than one hole at any site while the assumption of `` independence '' of opposite species implicitly doubles the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , if one wants to keep two `` flavors '' in the problem , an infinite on - site repulsion between them should be introduced . that latter problem in one dimension maps exactly onto the problem of spinless , single - flavor particles @xcite and thus the single - band approach used throughout this work is justified . note that in the presence of the 2d degrees of freedom where the stripe as a whole can make wiggles the problem of these `` geometrical '' quantum numbers becomes more complicated @xcite .",
    "the last question is what energy scale defines the `` free '' kinetic energy difference between the stripe and no - stripe states .",
    "naively , such @xmath108 should be governed by the kinetic @xmath0-term since the hole motion can be made free in a 1d structure .",
    "however , the energy of the order @xmath130 is paid to `` prepare '' such a structure in a 2d af . let us consider the @xmath12 limit for the 1d hole motion and assume that the length of the adw is a free parameter which would minimize the total energy . in the continuum limit @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and the minimum of the energy is achieved at @xmath133 .",
    "the corresponding energy is @xmath134 .",
    "one recalls an almost identical consideration of the `` retraceable - path '' motion of the hole by the `` strings '' in the spin - polaron problem which also gives @xmath135 and @xmath136 , see ref .",
    "[ ] . therefore , there is no new energy scale , different from the homogeneous nel problem , introduced by the domain wall and the `` prepared - path '' motion in 1d adw is , in fact , not too different from the `` retraceable - path '' motion of the hole within the spin polaron .",
    "one may conclude that the same scale @xmath137 should govern the energetic balance favoring the stripe.@xcite this is yet another argument that the stripes are the outcome of the same tendencies which are seen already for the single - hole problem .",
    "the numerical study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model utilizes the dmrg method for the clusters up to @xmath138 with various boundary conditions ( bc s ) .",
    "the bc s at the left and right sides are always open ; if the bc s at the top and bottom are periodic we refer to the bc s as cylindrical .",

    "since for @xmath227 in either the stripe or the no - stripe system it is the kinetic energy of the individual charge excitation which is optimized , one can conclude that the formation of the stripe is `` kinetic - energy driven '' .",
    "the idea that stripe formation can be viewed as a condensation of a set of hole pairs has been discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] . here we see that if one preconfigures the adw , even a single hole is bound to it with substantial binding energy , and pairing is not involved .",
    "the quantitative description of stripe formation that we have developed , which does not involve pairing , suggests that pairing is a lower energy phenomena which can be considered after the stripe is formed .",
    "however , the condensation of pairs idea may also be a valid point of view .",
    "an energetic test for this point of view would be that the energy per hole of a stripe should be only slightly less than that of separate pairs . more specifically",

    "since the dmrg data look very much the same and also @xmath247 is almost the same as for the one - hole case , one may conclude that there is no binding involved here at all .",

    "we check the effectiveness of such processes by studying two holes in the @xmath9 system with periodic bc s and mbius bcs .",
    "the mbius bc s suppress the stripe meandering considerably , which is seen in the hole density profiles , while the difference between the energies of the states is slightly above the numerical accuracy of the dmrg .",

    "the kinetic energy of the _ individual _ charge excitations at the domain wall , which includes significant components of both `` longitudinal '' and `` transverse '' motion , is the reason for the stripe formation .",
    "the pairing energy does not seem to be significantly modified and , in general , is associated with the smaller energy scale .",
    "meandering of the stripe , while being important for some other properties , has very little effect on the energy of the stripe .",

    "<S> the microscopic structure of a charge stripe in an antiferromagnetic insulator is studied within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model using analytical and numerical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a stripe in an antiferromagnet should be viewed as a system of composite holon - spin - polaron excitations condensed at the self - induced antiphase domain wall ( adw ) of the antiferromagnetic spins . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of such excitations are studied in detail with numerical and analytical results for various quantities being in very close agreement . </S>",
    "<S> a picture of the stripe as an effective one - dimensional ( 1d ) band of such excitations is also in very good agreement with numerical data . </S>",
    "<S> these results emphasize the primary role of kinetic energy in favoring the stripe as a ground state . </S>",
    "<S> a comparative analysis suggests the effect of pairing and collective meandering on the energetics of the stripe formation to be secondary . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of this microscopic picture of fermions bound to the 1d antiferromagnetic adw for the effective theories of the stripe phase in the cuprates are discussed . </S>"
