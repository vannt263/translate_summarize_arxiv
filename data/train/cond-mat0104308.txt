    "cobalt spin configurations change with temperature and sr concentration giving a rich variety of magnetic and transport properties that has attracted considerable attention over the last four decades .",
    "the simultaneous presence of strong electron@xmath5electron interaction within the transition - metal cobalt @xmath6 manifold and a sizable hopping - interaction strength between the @xmath6 and oxygen @xmath7 states are primarily responsible for the wide range of properties exhibited by these compounds .",
    "lacoo@xmath2 is unique in that it is a diamagnetic semiconductor@xcite with a spin gap of 30mev , a charge gap of 0.1ev and a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure at low temperature .",
    "it undergoes a spin - state transition from a diamagnetic state to a paramagnetic state with a finite moment at 100k and from semiconductor to metal above @xmath8.@xcite to account for the experimentally observed spin - state transition , both phenomenological explanations and _ ab initio _ based theories were proposed .",
    "the magnetic properties of the cobaltites depend on the spin state of co@xmath9 and co@xmath10 , i.e. whether they are in the low- , intermediate- or high - spin state .",
    "lacoo@xmath2 itself is a nonmagnetic insulator at low temperature , usually referred to as a low - spin state ( ls , @xmath11 = 0 ) because the atomic configuration ( @xmath12 ) of co@xmath9 ions has no magnetic moment .",
    "magnetic susceptibility slowly increases with temperature and reaches a maximum at @xmath13 90k . above this temperature ,",
    "the system shows a curie@xmath5weiss@xmath5law behavior , which is followed by a structural transition at 500k .",
    "the origin of the low - temperature increase in the susceptibility is unclear at present .",
    "it is suggested that this could be due to frozen - in ferromagnetic domains which are trapped at low temperatures.@xcite although the spin state of the co ions and the nature of the transitions have been investigated for over 40 years these issues remain controversial . while it is generally agreed that the low - temperature phase is a nonmagnetic ls state both a high - spin state@xcite ( hs , @xmath11 = 2 , @xmath14 ) and an intermediate - spin state@xcite ( is , @xmath11 = 1 , @xmath15 ) have been proposed for lacoo@xmath2 at high temperature .",
    "most previous studies have treated the spin - state transition at 90k as a transition from the ls state to a thermally excited hs state,@xcite which is reported@xcite to be only 10@xmath580mev higher in energy than the low - spin state .",
    "the attempts to explain the spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath2 based on different experimental techniques is rather controversial .",
    "direct magnetic measurements allow one to unambiguously identify the ls state in the temperature range below 50k.@xcite the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility at low temperature , in the region around 100k has been understood in terms of thermal activation of a magnetic hs state from the ls ground state.@xcite an anomalous thermal expansion associated with the spin - state transition has also been observed@xcite below 100k .",
    "raccah and goodenough@xcite have emphasized that more complex supercell structures play an important role in the spin - state transition and reported the co - existence of ls and hs states of cobalt in lacoo@xmath2 and a first - order phase change at 1210k .",
    "rodriguez and goodenough@xcite have suggested from magnetic and transport measurements that lacoo@xmath2 is in an ls state below 35k , an ls - hs disordered state between 35 and 110k , an ls - hs ordered state between 110 and 350k and an is - hs ordered state above 650k .",

    "et al._@xcite have argued that the 100k transition is most likely due to an ls - to - is transition ( from analysis of photoemission spectra and magnetic susceptibility data ) , and also suggested that the 500k transition is due to the population of the hs state .",
    "the xps spectra of lacoo@xmath2 at room temperature and 573k along with ionic multiplet analysis suggest@xcite that the ls and hs states co - exist at room temperatures .",
    "polarized neutron scattering measurements@xcite exhibit two magnetic - electronic transitions , one near 90k and another near 500k .",
    "the spin - state transition is maintained to occur at low temperature , and the high temperature transition is not dominantly of magnetic origin .",

    "it has been concluded that the hybridization of oxygen @xmath7 orbitals and cobalt @xmath6 states stabilize the is state with spin @xmath11 = 1.@xcite heat capacity measurements also support the ls - to - is state transition.@xcite recent magnetic susceptibility and neutron - diffraction studies@xcite show that lacoo@xmath2 has the ls co@xmath9 configuration at the lowest temperatures .",
    "below 350k is remains isolated and localized ; above 650k , all the trivalent co ions are transformed to the is state with itinerant @xmath19 electrons .",
    "several theoretical attempts have also been made to understand the microscopic origin of the spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath2 . from an lda+u approach ( where u is the on - site coulomb interaction )",
    "korotin _ et al._@xcite have demonstrated that the is state is relatively stable over the hs state , as a result of the strong @xmath20 hybridization effect as well as of the orbital ordering effect .",
    "this is in contrast to the expectation from the simple ionic model .",
    "they have also explained the semiconducting behavior above the 100-to-500k region as a spatial ordering of orbitals associated with a jahn@xmath5teller distortion of an is state and the thermal disordering of this state results in a gradual crossover to the metallic state at high temperatures .",
    "however , a controversy still exists since the calculation of mizokawa and fujimori@xcite did not find the orbital - ordered state .",
    "recent neutron diffraction measurements@xcite also give no evidence for orbital ordering .",
    "the hartree@xmath5fock calculations on the multi - band lattice model@xcite have also shown that the is state is more stable than the hs state .",

    "the recent calculations@xcite within the unrestricted hartree@xmath5fock approximation and a real space recursion method suggest that the spin - state transition at 90k takes place from the ls to ls - hs ordered state .",
    "mizokawa and fujimori@xcite showed from unrestricted hartree@xmath5fock calculations that the ls state is the ground state and the is state is the first excited spin state .",
    "the hartree@xmath5fock calculation@xcite also shows that the total energy of the is state can be considerably lowered on ordering of the @xmath24 orbitals .",
    "the analysis of the core - level spectrum in terms of a configuration interaction model suggests that both ls and hs states coexist at low temperature ( 100k ) , but at 573k there is a decrease in the ls contribution related to local structural changes.@xcite    much of the difficulty in reaching a consensual interpretation originates from the traditional use of an ionic , ligand - field model .",
    "in such a picture , only two distinct spin states of co@xmath9 are energetically operational.@xcite also most of the calculations presented in literature dealing with spin - state transition involve only a few adjustable parameters . in order to obtain a better understanding of both , the spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath2 and the origin of the paramagnetic state with local magnetic moments , it is necessary to examine the energetics of various spin - ordered states as a function of hole doping / temperature .",
    "this is the motivation for the present study .",
    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in manganites with perovskite structure@xcite has stimulated research of compounds exhibiting large magnetoresistance .",

    "the ferromagnetic interactions between co@xmath9 and co@xmath10 are supposed to arise from a double exchange mechanism like that in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 materials .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism of the ferromagnetism and the metal - insulator transition in cobaltites are not well understood . in metallic samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( @xmath25 )",
    "the magnitude of the magnetoresistence is typically small whereas it becomes larger in the composition range @xmath26 , where the system is close to a metal@xmath5insulator transition.@xcite    la@xmath0a@xmath1coo@xmath2 are of considerable interest because of the peculiar way their magnetic and transport properties change with composition and temperature.@xcite extensive studies on electronic and magnetic properties of sr - substituted lanthanum cobaltite , la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 have provided many interesting results during the past four or five decades .",
    "the magnetic state of la@xmath0a@xmath1coo@xmath2 strongly depends on the doping concentration @xmath27 .",
    "jonker and van santen@xcite studied la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 already in 1953 by magnetization measurements and reported ferromagnetic order for an intermediate sr concentration .",
    "they argued that the double - exchange co@xmath28co@xmath10 interaction is responsible for the ferromagnetism .",
    "et al._@xcite measured the temperature dependence of mssbauer spectra for ferromagnetic la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) and reported that ferromagnetic sr - rich clusters coexist with paramagnetic la - rich regions in the same ( crystallographic speaking ) phase .",
    "the @xmath6 holes created by the sr substitution are itinerant both above and below the curie temperature ( @xmath30 ) and all the experimental results are explained on the basis of itinerant - electron ferromagnetism .",
    "et al._@xcite studied this system by magnetization measurements at low fields and obtained a phase diagram with a paramagnetic - to - spin - glass transition for @xmath31 and a paramagnetic - to - cluster - glass transition for @xmath32 .",

    "et al._@xcite calculated different magnetic phases for srcoo@xmath2 and concluded that srcoo@xmath2 is in the is ( @xmath34 ) state . the observed spin moment in la@xmath35sr@xmath36coo@xmath2 from neutron diffraction studies@xcite",
    "has concluded that the system will have co@xmath10 in the ls state and a mixed ls and hs configuration for co@xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic state of la@xmath0a@xmath16coo@xmath2 was suggested to be a mixture of hs co@xmath9 and ls co@xmath10 ( @xmath23),@xcite because the measured saturation magnetic moment is only about half of the moment for hs co@xmath9.@xcite from application of the numerically exact diagonalization method on co@xmath37o@xmath38 clusters it has been shown that a coexistence of hs and is due to strong @xmath39-@xmath19 mixing is most plausible in doped cobaltites.@xcite the evolution with sr doping of the magnetic and transport data has been interpreted@xcite as follows .",
    "for @xmath40 , the holes introduced into the coo@xmath17 array stabilize the is clusters trapped at sr@xmath21 at low temperatures and the is clusters become super - paramagnetic below @xmath30 = 230k . in the range @xmath41 ,",

    "con ] the findings of the present study are summarized .",
    "the present investigation is based on _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations derived from spin - polarized , density - functional theory ( dft ) . in particular",
    "we have applied the full - potential linearized - augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method as embodied in the wien97 code@xcite using the scalar - relativistic version without spin - orbit coupling . the charge density and the potentials",
    "are expanded into lattice harmonics up to @xmath44 = 6 inside the spheres and into a fourier series in the interstitial region .",
    "we have included the local orbitals@xcite for la @xmath45 , sr @xmath46 , co @xmath47 and o @xmath48 . the effects of exchange and correlation are treated within the generalized - gradient - corrected local spin - density approximation using the parameterization scheme of perdew _",
    "et al._@xcite we have carried out test calculations with different sets of * k*-points and found that the fsm curve changes considerably with the number of * k*-points .",
    "for example , when we use only 4*k*-points in our calculations we obtained the ferromagnetic state lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state . to ensure convergence for the brillouin zone integration 110*k*-points in the irreducible wedge of the first brillouin zone ( ibz ) were used for the rhombohedral structure and 84*k*-points in ibz for the cubic phase ( even half the number of these * k*-points gave the correct result qualitatively ) .",
    "a similar density of * k*-points was used in the supercell calculations .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by demanding the convergence of the total energy to be smaller than 10@xmath49ry / cell .",
    "this corresponds to a convergence of the charge to below 10@xmath50 electrons / atom .",
    "for all calculations the ratio between the sphere radii used are 1.25 , 0.88 and 1.25 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , where @xmath54=1.8 bohr .",
    "since the spin densities are well confined within a radius of about 1.5 bohr , the resulting magnetic moments do not depend strongly on variation of the atomic sphere radii .",
    "conventional spin - polarized calculations based on dft allows the moment to float and the ground state is obtained by minimizing the energy functional , ( @xmath55 ) , with respect to the charge and magnetization densities , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , under the constraint of a fixed number of electrons , @xmath58 . with the variational principle this corresponds to minimizing the functional @xmath59 = e[\\rho(r),m(r ) ] - \\mu [ \\int \\rho(r)dr - n ] , \\label{eqn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the chemical potential .",
    "the minimization gives @xmath61 leading to effective one - electron equations which are solved by a self - consistent procedure that determines the moment which minimizes the total energy . in cases where two ( or more ) local minima occur for different moments ,",
    "conventional spin - polarized calculations become difficult to converge or `` accidently '' converge to different solutions .",
    "although lacoo@xmath2 is a nonmagnetic material , our conventional spin - polarized calculations always converged to a ferromagnetic solution with a moment of 1.2@xmath4/f.u .    in order to reach convergence or to study spin fluctuations it is advantageous to calculate the total energy as a function of magnetic moment using the so - called fixed - spin - moment method.@xcite in this method one uses the magnetic moment ( @xmath62 ) as an external parameter and calculates the total energy as a function of @xmath62 . in general",
    "one must release the constraint that the fermi levels for up and down spins are equal because the equilibrium condition is not satisfied for arbitrary @xmath62 .",
    "the number of valence electrons ( @xmath58 ) is known and @xmath62 is fixed ( as input parameter ) determining the values for @xmath63 and @xmath64 from + @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the spin - up and spin - down dos , respectively . at maxima and minima of the fsm curve ,",
    "the two fermi levels are equal , i.e. @xmath63 = @xmath64 . in the fsm method eqn.[eqn1 ] is modified to minimize the functional @xmath59 = e[\\rho(r),m(r ) ] - \\mu[\\int\\rho(r)dr - n ] - h[\\int m(r)dr - m ] \\label{eqn2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the lagrange multiplier which applies the constraint of having a fixed spin moment @xmath62 .",
    "the orbital contributions to the magnetization are neglected , since they are usually small for @xmath6 transition - metal phases . instead of minimizing with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "it is more illustrative to change to the spin - up , @xmath69}$ ] , and spin - down , @xmath70}$ ] , densities . then the variational principle yields @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 may be identified as the chemical potentials for the two different spins .",
    "thus , the condition of having a fixed spin moment corresponds to using two different chemical potentials , i.e ; two fermi energies for one material at zero temperature .",
    "this can also be seen by rewriting of eqn.[eqn2 ] as    @xmath59 = e[\\rho(r),m(r ) ] - ( \\mu+h)[\\int\\rho^{\\uparrow}(r)dr - n^{\\uparrow } ]   -(\\mu - h)[\\int\\rho^{\\downarrow}(r)dr - n^{\\downarrow } ] .",
    "\\label{eqn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , the fsm method corresponds to fixing the number of electrons of the two spins separately . given @xmath58 and @xmath62 , @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "are defined from eqns .",
    "[ eqn : nm1 ] and [ eqn : nm2 ] .",
    "the associated fermi energies are then found from the relations @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the density of states and the fermi energy for spin @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "extensive fsm calculations have been undertaken to find theoretically the stability condition of @xmath6 and @xmath80 magnetic materials.@xcite similar calculations are also extensively used to explain the magneto - volume instabilities in invar alloys.@xcite      lacoo@xmath2 has a rhombohedrally distorted pseudo - cubic perovskite structure .",
    "the space group is @xmath81 and each unit cell contains two formula units .",
    "la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 has the rhombohedral structure with space group @xmath81 in the range @xmath82 and transforms to a cubic phase with the space group @xmath83 at higher sr contents .",
    "the rhombohedral distortion decreases with increase of @xmath27 . a similar variation results from thermal expansion for the parent lacoo@xmath2 .",
    "the oxygen atoms are in the 6e ( @xmath84 ) wykoff position with @xmath85 = 0.0522 .",
    "using the force minimization method we have optimized @xmath85 and found an optimized value of 0.0638 .",
    "the fsm calculations at low temperature are made with this value for @xmath85 and the experimental lattice parameters corresponding to 4k .",
    "the structural parameters for the hole - doped systems used in the present calculations are the same as those used in ref .. the spin - state transition is believed to occur mainly due to the larger variation of the co@xmath5o bond length with increasing temperature.@xcite hence , it is interesting to study the spin - state transition as a function of lattice parameters and we have performed fsm calculations for lacoo@xmath2 with lattice parameters corresponding to 4k as well as 1248k .",
    "the structural parameters at 1248k were taken from high - resolution powder - diffraction measurements.@xcite      the hole - doping effect in lacoo@xmath2 has been simulated using supercell calculations as well as virtual - crystal approximation ( vca ) calculations . for the vca calculation we have taken into account the experimentally reported@xcite structural parameter changes as a function of sr substitution .",
    "hence , these calculations accounted properly for the hybridization effect . in this approximation the true atom in the material is replaced by an `` average '' atom which is interpolated linearly in charge between the corresponding pure atoms .",
    "in the vca calculations the charge - transfer effect is not throughly accounted for , whereas the band - filling effects are properly taken into account .",
    "the chosen approximation has an advantage owing to its simplicity and hence we are able to study small concentrations of sr in lacoo@xmath2 .",
    "however , for 50% sr substitution we have made explicit supercell fsm calculations .",
    "our current results are based on total - energy fplapw - band calculations utilizing the fsm procedure .",
    "we have considered only the ferromagnetic state . each point on the @xmath86 curves shown in fig.[fig : fsm4k ]",
    "is derived from a band calculation in which the total moment of the phase was constrained to a given @xmath62 value .",
    "the fsm procedure fixes only the total moment and not the local moments .",
    "the latter are free to take whatever value that minimizes the energy . in all cases ,",
    "the local moments vanish at @xmath62 = 0 ; i.e. , the situation @xmath62 = 0 is never produced by a cancellation of opposite local moments .",
    "the calculated dos for lacoo@xmath2 are shown in fig.[fig : spindos ] for the three spin arrangements ls , is and hs .",
    "first of all , the results predict a metallic behavior for the ls state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spindos]c ) of lacoo@xmath2 , but the total dos has a sharp minimum at @xmath87 .",
    "this is in contrast to the semiconducting behavior observed experimentally.@xcite this kind of discrepancy may be expected in narrow - band materials due to correlation effect .",
    "however , this does not hold in the present case as our recent optical property calculations for lacoo@xmath2 show good agreement with experimental spectra up to 25 ev .",
    "hence , the metallic behavior in lacoo@xmath2 is due to the usual underestimation of the band gap in lda and not due to the correlation effect .",
    "we have recently reported@xcite on the bonding behavior of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 and found indications of strong covalent hybridization between o @xmath39 and co @xmath19 in this phase . for a more detailed discussion about the bonding behavior reference is made to the preceding communication.@xcite the o @xmath39 and co @xmath19 states",
    "are mixed with each other in the valence band . by contrast",
    ", the la spectral weight contributes mainly to the unoccupied electronic states in the conduction band .",
    "this suggests that la has more ionic character and is stabilized by the madelung potential whereas the covalent contribution to the bonding is more prominent within the co@xmath5o octahedra .",
    "the sharp feature at 4ev above the fermi level corresponds to the la @xmath88 band and the dos segment at 4@xmath58ev is composed mainly of la @xmath89 states .",
    "the co @xmath6 states are very important and deserve to be discussed in more detail because they determine the magnetic properties .",
    "lacoo@xmath2 has a pseudocubic perovskite structure with a rhombohedral distortion along the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "since the rhombohedral distortion is small , we use the concept of @xmath90 and @xmath24 orbitals ( as referred to in the cubic situation ) in the following discussion . in an octahedral crystal field",
    "the @xmath19 electrons will be split into double degenerate @xmath24 and triple degenerate @xmath90 states .",
    "the @xmath90 and @xmath24 projected density of states of co in the cubic phases of lacoo@xmath2 and srcoo@xmath2 are given in fig.[fig : ddos ] for the non - spin - polarized and ferromagnetic cases .",
    "the strong peak below the fermi level corresponds to the co @xmath90 bands .",
    "these relatively non - bonding states produce weak co@xmath5o@xmath5co interactions which give rise to a narrow band .",
    "by contrast , the co @xmath24 states produce very strong co@xmath5o@xmath5co interactions which give rise to a much larger dispersion , and result in the broader @xmath24 band observed for both lacoo@xmath2 and srcoo@xmath2 .",
    "when the spin polarization is included in the calculations , the @xmath90 states for the majority spin become localized compared with the non - spin - polarized case and thus the total energy calculation shows that the ferromagnetic state is lower in energy than in the nonmagnetic case.@xcite however , for the minority - spin state in fig.[fig : ddos]a @xmath87 is located at a sharp non - bonding @xmath90 peak . as this is not a favorable condition for stability",
    ", a rhombohedral distortion arises due to a jahn@xmath5teller / peirls - like instability .",
    "the simple ligand model predicts that for the ls state in lacoo@xmath2 , that the @xmath90 levels are completely filled and the @xmath24 states completely empty . in our calculation , however , the @xmath24 states are distributed over the entire valence and conduction bands .",
    "the band structure obtained from a tight - binding method@xcite also shows that the @xmath24 orbitals partly fall below the fermi level and are mixed with the @xmath90 orbitals .",
    "this feature can be understood as follows .",
    "the lobes of the @xmath90 orbitals point between the oxygen ligands , whereas the @xmath24 orbitals point directly towards the ligands .",
    "hence , the overlap with o @xmath7 orbitals will be greater for the @xmath24 states , and the increased overlap results in local repulsion between overlapping charge densities .",
    "this repulsive interaction pushes the @xmath24 orbitals to higher energy .",
    "however , some of the repulsion is compensated by hybridization in the resulting bonding states which in turn leads to considerable amount of @xmath24 state in the conduction band .",
    "the calculations show that @xmath87 lies in the vicinity of the sharp non - bonding @xmath90 peak for the co @xmath6 electrons at the ground state ls configuration . in this case ,",
    "a small shift in @xmath87 leads to large changes in @xmath91 and causes the ferromagnetic instability of the system .",
    "so , the presence of the high dos close to @xmath87 and the small energy difference between the nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic state are the two main reasons for the temperature induced anomalies in the physical properties .",
    "considering dos for lacoo@xmath2 in the rhombohedral structure and the ls state , it is interesting to note that @xmath87 lies in a pseudogap which separates bonding from anti - bonding states . as a result",
    "there is a gain in one - electron energy and the system stabilizes in the rhombohedrally distorted nonmagnetic phase . in the case of srcoo@xmath2",
    ", the @xmath6 dos of co in the non - spin - polarized case shows that @xmath87 lies in a sharp peak which originates from non - bonding @xmath90 states . here",
    "the stoner criterion is fulfilled and the ferromagnetism appears . in the spin - polarized case",
    "these @xmath90 states are exchange split as shown in fig.[fig : ddos]a . unlike lacoo@xmath2",
    "the co-@xmath6 @xmath90 states for spin - polarized srcoo@xmath2 are well separated from @xmath87 and hence stabilizing the ferromagnetic state .",

    "even though srcoo@xmath2 is stabilized in the cubic ferromagnetic phase , our calculation shows that @xmath87 falls on a shoulder of the nonbonding minority spin co @xmath90 dos .",
    "this may be one reason for the presence of oxygen vacancies in srcoo@xmath2 .",
    "the pseudo - gap feature in the vicinity of the fermi level disappeares in the is and hs state of lacoo@xmath2 as shown in figs.[fig : spindos]a and b , respectively . in fig.[fig : fsm4k ] the limits of the is and hs states are represented by vertical lines .",
    "a detailed examination of energy vs. moment shows that the slope change its sign around 1@xmath4 .",

    "moreover our calculation predicts the hs state to be a half - metallic ferromagnet whereas according to lda+u calculations it should be a semiconductor .",
    "the reason for the metallic behavior of the is state is that the bands formed by @xmath24 orbitals are broad and the band splitting is not strong enough to create a gap . on the other hand , in the hs state , the @xmath92 band becomes completely filled and a band gap appears in the majority - spin state .",
    "dos for the is and hs states shows that the nonbonding @xmath90 electrons are present at @xmath87 in the minority - spin state .",

    "shimada@xcite concluded that co@xmath9 is in an hs state in la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 and co@xmath10 in an ls state because the saturation moment in the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath95 ) is only about half the full moment of hs co@xmath9.@xcite a transition from ls to hs through doping has been suggested from nmr studies on @xmath96co and @xmath97la@xcite probes and neutron scattering.@xcite electron spectroscopy@xcite and magnetic measurements@xcite indicate that hole doping leads to the formation of hs rather than ls configuration . as the radius of sr@xmath21 is larger than that of la@xmath9 , it is suggested that the sr doping favors the hs state by the introduction of co@xmath98).@xcite the hs state of co@xmath9 possesses @xmath99 , viz .",
    "a maximum magnetic moment of @xmath100 = 4@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to the purely ionic model ; hybridization of co @xmath6 orbitals with the o 2p orbital and the band formation in the solid states can significantly renormalize this ionic value .",

    "the increasing trend of magnetic moment as a function of hole doping originates for two reasons .",
    "firstly , owing to band - filling effects the hole doping moves the fermi level to the sharp t@xmath110 peak and hence enhances dos at the fermi level as well as the exchange splitting .",
    "secondly , an effect of reduced hybridization resulting from the fact that sr@xmath21 is larger in size than la@xmath9 and the consequent expansion in lattice on increasing substitution . as a result the bands narrow which in turn enhances the spin polarization .",
    "a metamagnetic transition refers to paramagnetic metallic materials which are rendered ferromagnetic by applying a sufficiently large external magnetic field .",
    "such a possibility was first discussed by wohlfarth and rhodes@xcite and later extended by shimizu.@xcite phenomena related to band metamagnetism are observed mainly in co - based materials such as pyrite - type phases cos@xmath37,@xcite , co(se , s)@xmath37@xcite , laves - type phases yco@xmath37@xcite , scco@xmath37@xcite , luco@xmath37@xcite , hexagonal fe@xmath37p - type phases co@xmath37p , conip and orthorhombic co@xmath37p - type@xcite phases comp ( m = mo and ru ) .",
    "metamagnetism has also been found experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite in ucoal .",
    "itinerant - electron metamagnets possess an anomalous temperature dependence of the susceptibility which increases with temperature and then decreases after a maximum at a finite temperature ( @xmath111 ) and usually obeys the curie@xmath5weiss law at higher temperatures.@xcite it has been revealed that @xmath111 is closely correlated with the metamagnetic transition field @xmath112.@xcite a maximum in the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility has been observed for the itinerant - band metamagnets scco@xmath37@xcite , yco@xmath37@xcite and luco@xmath37.@xcite lacoo@xmath2 also shows a temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility with an increasing trend at low temperature and a marked maximum around 90k followed by a curie@xmath5weiss - law - like decrease at higher temperatures@xcite which is similar to that of the itinerant metamagnets .",

    ", the ground state of lacoo@xmath2 corresponds to the nonmagnetic ls state .",
    "however , the minimum of the ferromagnetic is state occurs about 32mev above the ls state ( fig.[fig : fsm4k ] ) .",
    "the existence of a ferromagnetic solution as a quasi - stable state implies that a discontinuous transition in magnetization would be possible by application of a magnetic field .",
    "this metamagnetic is state is destroyed by temperature as shown in fig.[fig : fsm1248k ] . in our calculation temperature",
    "is introduced via volume expansion and hence the disappearance of is by temperature is due to the weakening of hybridization between co @xmath19 and o @xmath39 states .",

    "the disappearence of the metamagnetic behavior and the appearence of ferromagnetism on hole doping in lacoo@xmath2 can be understood as follows .",
    "the reduction in valence electrons by the sr substitution shifts @xmath87 to the lower energy side of vb towards the peak position in the dos . as a result ,",
    "the stoner criterion for band ferromagnetism becomes fulfilled and the metastable state is stabilized as a ferromegnetic state .    according to the fsm method , the spin - projected dos are filled up to @xmath87 for spin - up and spin - down electrons in order to yield the desired externally fixed - spin magnetic moment . in effect",
    "we are dealing with a system in a uniform magnetic field @xmath114 , which maintains the magnetic moment of the system .",
    "the difference in fermi energy corresponds to a difference in magnetic energy @xmath115 .",
    "since this difference is related to the size of the external magnetic field , a vanishing difference corresponds to an extremum in the magnetic total energy .",

    "these solutions then correspond to what one can derive by usual spin - polarized calculations . from fig.[fig : fermi ] it is seen that @xmath120 nearly vanishes at the metastable magnetic state obtained in our fsm curve .    the theoretical exploration of wohlfarth and rhodes@xcite revealed that the metamagnetic transition originates from the sharp peak in dos in the vicinity of @xmath87 . the metamagnetic state in transition - metal phases",
    "is connected with the magnetic - field - induced splitting of the majority and minority @xmath6 subbands of the transition metal .",
    "et al._@xcite have pointed out that , according to the stoner theory , @xmath87 of the itinerant @xmath19 electrons lies near a minimum or on a steep decrease in the dos curve , so that there appears anomalous temperature and magnetic field dependences in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dos curve for lacoo@xmath2 in the ls state ( fig.[fig : spindos]c ) also shows @xmath87 in a deep valley just above the co @xmath6 @xmath90 peak . in this case",
    "the ferromagnetic state with a rather large magnetic moment can be approached by the applied magnetic field .",
    "this may be the possible origin for the appearance of the metamagnetism as well as the anomalous behavior in the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the metamagnetic transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state can be understood as follows .",
    "the applied external field shifts the up- and down - spin bands by a small amount . as a consequence",
    "the system gains potential energy owing to the reduced coulomb interaction , but at the same time loses energy owing to an increase in the kinetic energy .",
    "the final induced magnetic moment will be determined by the balance between these two terms . however , in some systems there will be , for a certain critical value of the applied field , a sudden gain in potential energy which is not sufficiently counterbalanced by the kinetic term .",
    "hence , the metamagnetic spin state develops.@xcite more quantitatively , the criterion for the onset of metamagnetism may be written@xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the multi - band stoner parameter , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are dos at @xmath125 for the spin - up and -down bands , respectively . if the densities of the two state simultaneously attain sufficiently large values for a given applied field , a metamagnetic transition will take place .",
    "a glance at fig.[fig : spindos ] shows that a small splitting of the spin band will indeed give large values of both @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this explains the occurrence of the metamagnetic transition in lacoo@xmath2 .      despite numerous studies",
    "the nature of the spin - state transition is still under debate .",

    "the polarized neutron - scattering experiments@xcite firmly supported that the spin - state transition takes place at about 90k which is in sharp contrast to the interpretation of x - ray absorption spectroscopy@xcite data which indicates that the spin - state transition takes place in the range 400@xmath5650k coinciding with the gradual semiconductor - to - metal transition .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of the perovskite la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 has been obtained as a function of sr substitution and volume from a series of generalized - gradient - corrected , full - potential , spin - density - functional band structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the energetics of different spin configurations are estimated using the fixed - spin - moment ( fsm ) method . from the total energy vs spin magnetic moment curve for lacoo@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is found to be nonmagnetic with the co ions in a low - spin ( ls ) state , a result that is consistent with the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat higher in energy , we find an intermediate - spin ( is ) state with spin moment @xmath31.2@xmath4/f.u . from the anomalous temperature </S>",
    "<S> dependent susceptibility along with the observation of an is state we predict metamagnetism in lacoo@xmath2 originating from an ls - to - is transition . the is state is found to be metallic and the high - spin ( hs ) state of lacoo@xmath2 </S>",

    "<S> the fsm calculations on la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 suggest that the hole doping stabilizes the is state and the calculated magnetic moments are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the hs state can not be stabilized by temperature or hole doping since the hs state is significantly higher in energy than the ls or is state . </S>",
    "<S> hence the spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath2 by temperature / hole doping is from an ls to an is spin state and the present work rules out the other possibilities reported in the literature . </S>"
