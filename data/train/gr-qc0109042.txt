    "the invariance under scale transformation is one of the important features of gravitational physics as long - range force in general relativity as well as in newtonian gravity .",
    "the scale invariance of field equations implies the existence of solutions which are invariant under the scale transformation .",
    "such scale - free solutions are called _ self - similar solutions_. among them , the most widely researched system in general relativity is a spherically symmetric self - similar spacetime with a perfect fluid , which is pioneered by cahill and taub  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such solutions requires the equation of state to be the form @xmath0 if it is barotropic .",

    "spherically symmetric self - similar solutions are classified with the theory of dynamical systems  @xcite and with their asymptotic forms  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review , see  @xcite .",
    "although self - similar solutions form a zero - measure set of solutions to the field equations , several authors conjectured that self - similar solutions play important roles in gravitational collapse and/or in cosmological situations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this context , the so - called larson - penston self - similar solution has been shown to describe generic gravitational collapse of isothermal gas in newtonian gravity  @xcite .",
    "this solution was discovered by penston and independently by larson  @xcite , and after that generalized to general relativity by ori and piran  @xcite .",
    "actually , newtonian self - similar solutions are obtained by taking the limit @xmath8 of those in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown by numerical simulations and a normal mode analysis that the general relativistic counterpart of the larson - penston solution is an _ attractor solution _ in general relativistic gravitational collapse  @xcite .",
    "this convergence phenomena , i.e. , the generic convergence to a self - similar solution , can be regarded as the recovery of scale - invariance symmetry in gravitational physics because the scale - invariance symmetry which the system of the field equations originally has is regained in gravitational collapse even if the symmetry is lost in the initial situation . in the larson - penston solution",
    ", a naked singularity develops from regular initial data for @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for the relationship between the cosmic censorship conjecture and the nature of the larson - penston solution as an attractor .",
    "in addition to the attractive nature of a self - similar solution , the critical behavior in the gravitational collapse discovered by choptuik  @xcite shed light on self - similarity ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "he investigated the threshold between the collapse to a black hole and the dispersion to infinity in the self - gravitating system of a massless scalar field .",
    "he found critical behavior , such as the mass - scaling law for the formed black hole mass , which is analogous to that in statistical physics .",
    "he also found that there is a discrete self - similar solution that sits at the threshold of the black hole formation , which is called a _",
    "critical solution_. after that , evans and coleman  @xcite observed similar phenomena in the collapse of a radiation fluid ( @xmath10 ) and found that the critical solution coincides with one of the continuous self - similar solutions with analyticity , which we call evans - coleman solution  , evans - coleman solution for convenience in this paper . ] .",

    "the detailed characteristics of the evans - coleman solution for @xmath11 was investigated  @xcite . moreover , ` hunter ( a ) ' self - similar solution , which was originally discovered by hunter  @xcite , was identified with the newtonian counterpart of the evans - coleman solution  @xcite .    for newtonian self - similar solutions , ori and piran  @xcite pointed out the existence of _ kink instability _ in a wide class of self - similar solutions . the kink mode results from the existence of sonic points .",
    "the nature of sonic points was examined in newtonian gravity  @xcite and in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the kink mode corresponds to the injection of a weak discontinuity at sonic points at some initial moment .",
    "the instability is characterized by the divergence of the discontinuity in a finite time interval .",
    "the blow - up of this mode implies shock wave formation .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis was restricted to newtonian gravity and applies at most to the case @xmath13  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the analysis is generalized to fully general relativistic case .",
    "the stability criterion obtained here applies even to the case for any value of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "then , we can deal with highly relativistic situations , such as the collapse of a radiation fluid , the evolution of early universe , and so on .",
    "the obtained criterion gives a sufficient condition for instability and a necessary condition for stability , because the analysis is specified on the kink mode .",

    "ii , basic equations are presented . in section iii ,",
    "the classification of sonic points are reviewed , which is closely related to the kink instability . in section iv , the stability for the kink mode is analyzed in full order , and a stability criterion for this mode is derived . in section",

    "the stability criterion which applies to all possible situations is the following : if @xmath211 at the sonic point , then the solution is unstable , while , if not , then the solution is stable for the kink mode .",
    "this criterion can be rewritten in terms of the partial derivative with respect to @xmath212 or @xmath213 as follows : in terms of the derivative with respect to @xmath212 , if @xmath214 , then the solution is unstable , while , if not , the solution is stable for the kink mode ; in terms of the partial derivative with respect to @xmath213 , if @xmath215 at the sonic point , the solution is unstable , while , if not , the solution is stable for this mode .",
    "however , it should be noted that we can not say that a solution is stable because our analysis is specified on the kink mode .",

    ", we conclude that the larson - penston solution is stable for the kink mode for @xmath3 , while it is unstable for @xmath234 .",
    "it is important that the kink mode does not affect the nature of the larson - penston solution as an attractor for @xmath3 , while it does for @xmath234 .    for @xmath132 ,",

    "this suggests that the solution can not describe a realistic expanding inhomogeneous universe for @xmath3 . from the larson - penston solution for @xmath131 ,",
    "there is another method to construct the solution for @xmath132 .",
    "that is the analytic continuation of the solution for @xmath131 to @xmath132 . since the larson - penston solution is ` quasi - static ' , the analytic continuation beyond @xmath235 is possible  @xcite",

    ", it is found that the kink mode does not affect the critical nature of the evans - coleman solution for @xmath5 , while it is also found that the evans - coleman solution suffers the kink instability for @xmath6 .",
    "since the critical solution is assumed to have a single unstable mode , it indicates that the evans - coleman solution for @xmath6 can not be a critical solution because the solution has one analytic unstable mode and one non - analytic unstable mode , i.e. , the kink mode .    for @xmath132 ,",
    "the time - reversed evans - coleman solution is unstable for @xmath5 , while it is stable for @xmath6 for the kink mode .",

    ", the analytic continuation beyond @xmath235 is possible .",
    "however , it was shown that the analytically continuated evans - coleman solution beyond @xmath235 encounters another sonic point and will not be able to cross it regularly  @xcite .",
    "here we should comment on the recent work by neilsen and choptuik  @xcite .",
    "they numerically simulated the pde s ( einstein s equations and equations of motion for a perfect fluid ) and found critical behavior even for @xmath6 .",
    "they found that the critical solution obtained by solving the pde s well agreed with the evans - coleman self - similar solution which is obtained by solving the ode s with the requirement of analyticity at the sonic point . by numerical simulations of the pde s",
    ", they measured the critical exponent of the power law which the formed black hole mass obeys .",
    "the obtained value of critical exponent is continuous with respect to the change of @xmath14 .",
    "it implies the existence of one analytic unstable mode .",
    "in contrast , we have shown that the evans - coleman solution suffers kink instability for @xmath6 .",
    "we would like to point out the following three possibilities .",
    "the first is that perturbations which belonged to the kink mode in their numerical simulations might have been so small that there would have been little time for the kink mode to grow up sufficiently until the numerical simulations were stopped for other reasons .",
    "the second is that some kind of numerical viscosity , which is usually included in numerical codes of fluid dynamics deliberately or not deliberately , might have killed the kink instability .",
    "the third possibility is that the nonlinear coupling of the kink mode with other analytic modes might have weakened the growth of instability . in spite of such possibilities , for @xmath6 ,",
    "the evans - coleman has two unstable modes , one is analytic and the other is not analytic .",
    "it is remarkable that the stability analysis for the kink mode of self - similar solutions in general relativity is completely parallel to that in newtonian gravity .",
    "the stability for the kink mode is determined by the class of the pertinent sonic point .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the present analysis on the stability of general relativistic self - similar solutions contains the newtonian analysis for isothermal gas as a limit of @xmath8 . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that @xmath241 , i.e. , a dust fluid , is not included in the present analysis since self - similar solutions with a dust fluid can not be regarded as a continuous limit of @xmath8 of those with @xmath0 in several respects  @xcite .",
    "since we have concentrated on self - similar solutions with @xmath0 for @xmath15 , we have not dealt with a ` stiff matter ' , i.e. , @xmath242 .",
    "this is because , as seen in equations  ( [ eq : zs])-([eq : etas ] ) , ( [ eq : eta s ] ) , ( [ eq : veta ] ) , ( [ eq : etas1 ] ) and ( [ eq : deltavdeltaeta ] ) , it is clear that more careful treatment is needed for that case .",
    "the stiff matter is one of the most important examples that can be described by the perfect fluid model because it is equivalent to a massless scalar field under certain conditions  @xcite . in spite of this equivalence ,",
    "the critical phenomena which have been observed in these two systems look very different  @xcite .",
    "hence , the analysis for a stiff matter will be very interesting .",
    "we have studied the stability of self - similar solutions with perfect fluids in general relativity . it has been found that a wide class of self - similar solutions turn out to be unstable against the kink mode .",
    "the development of this instability will result in the formation of a shock wave .",
    "since the present analysis is specified only on the kink mode , we can not say about generic outcome of the growth of this instability . however , it is probable that the nonlinear coupling with analytic modes may play important roles in the development of the instability .",
    "the proposition that the stability of solutions for this mode is solely governed by the nature of the pertinent sonic point applies to general relativity as well as to newtonian gravity .",
    "the obtained criterion has been applied to several known self - similar solutions in general relativity .",
    "then , it turns out that the expanding flat friedmann solution has a growing kink mode for @xmath224 .",
    "the existence of the growing kink mode in the flat friedmann solution with a radiation fluid might affect the standard cosmological structure formation scenario .",
    "we have also investigated the stability of self - similar collapse solutions which have recently called attention in the convergence and critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse of a perfect fluid in general relativity .",
    "the results are that the larson - penston ( attractor ) solution loses its attractive nature for @xmath234 and that the evans - coleman ( critical ) solution loses its critical nature for @xmath6 .",
