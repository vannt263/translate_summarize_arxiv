    "the families of kicked harper and on  resonance double kicked rotor operators that we discuss in this paper arose comparatively recently in the field of quantum chaos and most of the knowledge about them has been acquired through numerical computation . they are related to another family of operators that arose earlier , that is simpler , and whose properties are far better understood theoretically .",

    "the spectrums of these operators have been studied for several decades and are well understood . in 1964 azbel @xcite conjectured that if @xmath2 is irrational then the spectrum of @xmath21 is a cantor set . in 1976",
    "hofstadter @xcite , observing that the spectrum of @xmath21 is independent of @xmath22 if and only if @xmath2 is irrational , argued that `` there can be no physical effect stemming from the irrationality of some parameter '' and proposed to study instead the set @xmath23.\\ ] ] he computed @xmath24 numerically for a fine grid of rational values of @xmath25 and studied the graph of this set - valued function of @xmath2 ( a subset of the rectangle @xmath26 \\times ( 0,1)$ ] ) .",

    "simon and bellisard @xcite showed that if @xmath28 where @xmath5 and @xmath3 are coprime , then @xmath29 consists of @xmath3 disjoint closed intervals if @xmath3 is odd and @xmath30 disjoint closed intervals if @xmath3 is even , and they used this result to prove that for a @xmath31 set of pairs @xmath32 in @xmath33 @xmath29 is a cantor set . in 1993 choi , elliot and yui @xcite used the noncommutative binomial theorem to compute sharper estimates for the spectral gaps when @xmath2 is rational and used these estimates to prove that @xmath29 is a cantor set whenever @xmath2 is a liouville number .",
    "in 1993 last @xcite proved that for almost all @xmath25 the lebesque measure of @xmath29 equals @xmath34 for all @xmath35 and hence that @xmath24 is a cantor set . in 1987 sinai @xcite",

    "+   + in 1979 casati , chirikov , ford and izrailev @xcite and berry , balazs , taber and voros @xcite initiated the study of families of unitary operators that describe the time evolution of quantum systems whose classical limits exhibit chaotic dynamics .",
    "developments in the field of quantum chaos @xcite led to the so - called kicked harper operators that admit the following representations on @xmath41 @xmath42 \\ ,          \\exp \\big [ -i 2 \\kappa \\ , \\lambda \\cos \\big(-i \\alpha \\frac{d}{dx } + 2\\pi \\theta \\big ) \\big ] . \\ , \\ ] ] we observe that @xmath43 as @xmath44 in 1990 leboeuf , kurchan , feingold and arovas @xcite studied a quantum version of a classical kicked harper map whose phase space is a ( compact ) torus and that exhibits chaotic dynamics for sufficiently large values of certain parameters .",
    "their quantum kicked harper operators arise through canonical quantization of this classical harper map and have the form @xmath45 ( see equation  [ op4 ] below ) and is represented on the hilbert space @xmath46 to quantize the system on the torus they set @xmath2 to be the area of classical phase space in units of planck s constant and they choose @xmath47 with @xmath3 an integer .",
    "however , their quantum operators admit the family ( parameterized by @xmath22 ) of representations on @xmath48 that have the form @xmath49 in 1991 geisel , ketzmerick and petschel @xcite studied the dependence on @xmath50 of the spectra of the operators @xmath51 where @xmath2 ranges over the interval @xmath52 .",
    "these spectra are the same as the union over @xmath22 of the spectrums of @xmath53 they also remark that @xmath22 can be thought of as being proportional to a quasimomentum which arises in analogy to bloch s theorem .",
    "they observe that for small @xmath54 the collection of spectrums for rational @xmath55 has the hofstadter butterfly pattern for small @xmath54 , and that as @xmath54 increases the spectral bands close up .",
    "they also compute the effect of @xmath50 on other quantities such as diffusion and localization . in 1992",
    "artuso , casati , and shepelyansky @xcite studied a quantum version of another classical kicked harper map whose phase space is a ( noncompact ) cylinder .",
    "their operators have the form @xmath56 this quantization evidently differs from the canonical quantization of leboeuf _",
    "_ insofar as the state space of the quantum system equals @xmath48 , the quasimomentum parameter is fixed at @xmath57 , and there are no restrictions on @xmath2 .",
    "the quantum version with @xmath57 was later widely used , though a more general quantization gives the operator @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the fact that a classical kicked harper map can be quantized in many ways was probably best summarized by guarneri and borgonovi @xcite .",
    "another family of operators we study here is the so - called on  resonance double kicked rotor operators .",

    "they and mouritzen discussed how the operators @xmath61 can be realized experimentally , and demonstrated numerically a striking resemblance between the spectrums of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for a large set of rational @xmath28 with @xmath5 and @xmath3 coprime .",
    "in particular , figure  2 in @xcite shows that the spectrums for @xmath66 are different , but very nearly equal .    one main objective of this work is to mathematically explain this resemblance between on - resonance double kicked rotor operators and the kicked harper operators , by proving that for all values of @xmath67 the spectrums of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are equal whenever @xmath2 is irrational and that their hausdorff distance approaches zero as @xmath3 increases for rational @xmath70 because wang and gong @xcite also showed that the dynamics of the on - resonance double kicked rotor model dramatically differs from that of the kicked harper model for irrational @xmath2 , our proof of the spectral equivalence , in addition to mathematical interest , shall motivate new theoretical problems , such as the characterization of ( generalized ) eigenfunctions of the operators and of density of states or of the degeneracy of the spectrums , which ultimately accounts for the dynamical differences observed by wang and gong .",
    "our proof is based on @xmath71algebra methods .",
    "the proof itself also leads to efficient algorithms for numerical studies of the above - mentioned unitary operators .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the observation that the spectral graph of @xmath72 has a butterfly pattern similar to that previously observed for @xmath73",
    ". though rigorous spectral characterization of @xmath73 and @xmath72 remains an open problem , we outline a strategy to prove the conjecture that the spectrum of their mother operators @xmath74 , or identically @xmath75 , is indeed a cantor set for irrational @xmath2 .",

    "the two - dimensional problem can be separated , yielding equation  [ eq : h1 ] in one direction , and plane - wave behavior perpendicular hereto .",

    "so to have @xmath325 would require @xmath326 t - orders of magnitude larger than what can be obtained in present laboratories .",
    "nevertheless , other physical situations provide realizations of the harper model with non  vanishing @xmath2 , yielding the first experimental indication of a hofstadter s butterfly spectrum in @xcite . following the rules of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the unitary harper operators @xmath164 defined in equation  [ eq : uh1 ] can be seen as the time propagator for a system with a time - independent hamiltonian given by @xmath320 , where the time interval propagated is proportional to @xmath50 .",

    "in contrast , the unitary kicked harper operators @xmath58 defined in equation  [ eq : ukh1 ] have not yet been experimentally realized , even though they play an important role in the field of quantum chaos .",
    "the possibility of experimentally realizing operators with the same spectrum as the kicked harper operators is what currently makes the on  resonance double kicked rotor particularly interesting from a physical point of view . the unitary on  resonance double kicked operators defined in equation  [ eq : uordkr1 ] , @xmath327 \\ ,          t(\\alpha ) \\ , \\exp \\big [ -i 2 \\kappa \\ , \\lambda \\ , \\cos\\big(2\\pi(x+\\theta)\\big ) \\ , \\big ] \\",

    "apart from the choice of experimental parameters , similar experiments have been performed earlier , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "specifically , the proposal considered a long quasi  one dimensional gas , consisting of cold atoms or a condensate , subjected to a time  periodic sequence of potential kicks caused by a standing wave generated by two counter  propagating pulsed laser beams .",
    "the kicking potential is sinusoidal with spatial period equal to half the lasers wavelength , and @xmath227 signifies position within such a spatial period . the time dependent hamiltonian is thus composed of brief time intervals where the dynamics are dominated by the kicking potential , and in between these kicks , time intervals where the dynamics are given by free ( kinetic energy only ) propagations .",
    "this hamiltonian commutes at all times with translation by half a wavelength , so assuming that the initial state also has this periodicity , the state at all later times will have it as well .",
    "we can thus restrict our attention to one period @xmath207 .",
    "we shall have more to say of this periodicity assumption below .",
    "the operator @xmath62 is the propagator for one time  period of kicks and free propagation , say from time @xmath328 to time @xmath329 .",
    "reading the terms in @xmath62 from right to left , the @xmath330th time ",

    "the two terms @xmath339 and @xmath340 are due to free propagation between the kicks .",

    "we notice that the existence of such a time is due to the free propagation having eigen  energies , which are all an integer multiple of a certain energy .",
    "we also note that the experimentally realizable ranges for the parameters have been estimated to be @xmath346,$ ] @xmath347 $ ] and @xmath348 $ ] , whereas @xmath22 can take on all values @xcite .    returning to the assumption that the initial state is periodic in @xmath227 ,",
    "we now consider a somewhat more general initial state , namely a bloch wave @xmath349 , where the wavefunction @xmath350 on the entire real axis is a product of a function @xmath351 having period @xmath344 , and a complex exponential with quasimomentum proportional to @xmath352 .",
    "this quasimomentum in the wavefunction would correspond to a real momentum of the entire gas or condensate cloud in the experimental setup .",
    "as above , the translational symmetry of the hamiltonian ensures that @xmath352 does not change in time .",
    "again , we can restrict our considerations to functions on the interval @xmath52 with the basis @xmath353 , provided we make the substitution @xmath354 . making these substitutions , and again choosing @xmath342",

    "the only effect of the factor @xmath366 is to shift the spectrum , so the spectral differences are easily seen . ]",
    "notably , although the @xmath22 in the kicked harper operator , equation  [ eq : ukh1 ] , can be thought of as coming from introducing a quasimomentum by @xmath368 , this procedure has little connection to the quasimomentum in the experiment proposed in @xcite .",
    "an interesting question for future research is thus how this assumption of @xmath369 influences the experimental realizability of @xmath62 , and if it can be relaxed . in a real experiment ,",
    "the cold atoms or condensate is trapped in a weak external potential , making the initial wavefunction a wide gaussian rather than a bloch wave , further complicating the situation .",
    "that being said , in the usual experimental situation , the wavefunction s finite width gives negligible contributions to the outcome of many presently performed measurements .",
    "finally , it should be noted that if one were instead to use a ring - shaped trap , the quasimomentum is exactly zero , and realizing the operator @xmath62 would not be troubled by the issues raised above . rather than using kicks from a laser , one",
    "must then use potential kicks that are linear in space , which would yield exactly the cosines in the angular coordinate of the ring , and the @xmath22parameter would be the angle between the directions of the spatially linear kicks .",

    "<S> we apply @xmath0algebra methods to explain this resemblance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that each pair of corresponding operators belong to a common rotation @xmath0algebra @xmath1 , prove that their spectrums are equal if @xmath2 is irrational , and prove that the hausdorff distance between their spectrums converges to zero as @xmath3 increases if @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath3 coprime integers . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that corresponding operators in @xmath6 are homomorphic images of mother operators in the universal rotation @xmath0algebra @xmath7 that are unitarily equivalent and hence have identical spectrums . </S>",
    "<S> these results extend analogous results for almost mathieu operators . </S>",
    "<S> we also utilize the @xmath0algebraic framework to develop efficient algorithms to compute the spectrums of these mother operators for rational @xmath2 and present preliminary numerical results that support the conjecture that their spectrums are cantor sets if @xmath2 is irrational . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture for almost mathieu operators , called the ten martini problem , was recently proved after intensive efforts over several decades . </S>",
    "<S> this proof for the almost mathieu operators utilized transfer matrix methods , which do not exist for the kicked operators . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a strategy , based on a special property of loop groups of semisimple lie groups , to prove this conjecture for the kicked operators . </S>"
