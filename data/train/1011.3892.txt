    "the artificial - star - test technique has been widely applied to photometry of crowded stellar fields over the last few decades . by adding artificial stars to the original , raw images and subsequently recovering them ,",
    "such tests have proved an efficient means of counting stars as a function of magnitude and measuring the associated photometric accuracies ( e.g. , bolte 1989 , 1994 ; bergbusch 1996 ; sandquist et al .",
    "1996 ; da rocha et al .",
    "2002 ; hargis et al .",
    "2004 ; fekadu et al .",
    "modern computers ( ` central processing units : ' cpus ) are becoming ever more powerful , thus providing opportunities to perform artificial - star experiments to characterize the color - magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) morphologies of remote , rich star clusters and obtain cluster binary fractions by comparing cmds based on artificial and real stars ( e.g. , rubenstein & bailyn 1997 ; zhao & bailyn 2005 ; hu et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "however , even with the current generation of cpus , this method still consumes significant computation time if one wants to use it to derive cluster binary fractions , for which many more ( artificial ) stars are needed than to obtain observational completeness levels .",
    "for instance , bolte ( 1994 ) used @xmath0 artificial stars ( in 450 test runs , i.e. , on the order of 100 stars per trial , which must be compared to 200 artificial stars per run used in this paper ; see below ) to calculate the completeness fraction of his observations of the globular cluster m30 , where they recovered 5674 real stars within the range @xmath1 mag .",
    "similarly , bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) required @xmath2 artificial stars ( @xmath3 mag ) to obtain an estimate of the binary fraction in ngc 288 ( compared with 5766 observed stars in the cluster s central regions and 2013 near its half - light radius , with @xmath4 mag ) .    with such large artificial - star catalogs , both",
    "the addition of stars to the images and the subsequent data reduction required for recovery of these artificial stars will be enormously time - consuming . as an altenative , hu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) developed and applied a novel , efficient method ( in which they added artificial stars to the catalog instead of the images ) to obtain the binary fraction of the young large magellanic cloud cluster ngc 1818 .    in this paper , we use the raw images of ngc 1818 , taken with the wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ as an example to benchmark and compare the performance of both artificial - star - test methods . the photometric data are discussed in  2 .",
    "the commonly used method of adding artificial stars to images and our newly developed method to correct for stellar blends and superpositions based on catalog handling are presented in  3 .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two methods and validation of our new approach are provided in  4 .",
    "our example data set was obtained from _",
    "hst _ program go-7307 ( pi gilmore ) , which included three images in both the f555w and f814w filters ( with exposure times of 800 , 800 , and 900 s for each filter ) , centered at the cluster s half - light radius .",
    "the observations were reduced as described in hu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using hstphot ( version 1.1 , may 2003 ; dolphin 2005 ) .    in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "1 we show the resulting cmd , reduced using hstphot with the point - spread - function ( psf)-fitting option .",
    "the corresponding cmds , reduced using both hstphot with the aperture - photometry ( ` app ' ) option and iraf s apphot task ( liu et al . 2009 ) , are shown in the middle and right - hand panels . within the magnitude range from approximately 19 to 27 in both the f555w and f814w filters (",
    "an unambiguous detection in both filters was required ) , we recovered a total of 8756 and 7773 stars using psf fitting and aperture photometry based on hstphot , respectively , while liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recovered 7332 stars from the same data set ( but for @xmath5 mag ) .",
    "our new cmds are much cleaner ( we rejected stars with @xmath6 , which is a measure of the signal - to - noise ratio and a level recommended in the hstphot manual ; cf . dolphin 2000 ) than that of liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who did not apply a cut in signal - to - noise ratio , and the cluster s main sequence is much tighter .",
    "3 shows the standard deviations of the photometric uncertainties as a function of stellar magnitude .",
    "it is clear that , for the same magnitude range , the uncertainties associated with photometry of stars reduced by hstphot are smaller than the equivalent values resulting from application of iraf / apphot .",
    "this indicates that our most recently obtained photometry is more precise than that published by liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , because the hstphot software package is much better at properly handling stellar photometry in crowded _",
    "_ fields than iraf s apphot routine .",
    "note that although the psf - fitting approach recovered approximately a thousand more stars than the number detected by aperture photometry , the number of stars brighter than @xmath7 mag ( but recall that stars must be detected in both the f555w and f814 filters to be included ) was 5974 versus 5791 for the psf - fitting and aperture - photometry approaches , respectively .",
    "the corresponding growth curves for all three reduction methods are shown in fig . 2 and tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the numbers of stars resulting from psf fitting and aperture photometry are comparable ; they are much more numerous than those resulting from the use of iraf / apphot ( liu et al .",
    "therefore , we conclude that hstphot is more appropriate than standard iraf tasks to deal with stellar photometry in crowded _ hst _ images and that in crowded fields , such as for ngc 1818 , there is no significant difference in performance between the two photometric methods supported by hstphot ( except for faint stars close to the detection limit ; see also  4 ) .",
    "we developed our own routines , which we used instead of the iraf / addstar task , to add artificial stars to the images .",
    "the masses of the artificial stars were selected from a salpeter ( 1955)-like mass function , which was shown to be appropriate for this cluster by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and hu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for stellar masses in excess of 0.5 to @xmath8 . for each star",
    ", we calculated the magnitude and color by interpolation of the best - fitting girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrone for a cluster age of 25 myr and a metallicity of @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 ) .",
    "next , we converted the stellar absolute magnitude in the @xmath11 band ( @xmath12 ) to a total pixel value ( _ pv _ ) using @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the zero - point offset ( cf .",
    "hu et al . 2010 ) : @xmath15 , where photflam and photzpt ( @xmath16 ) are image - header keywords .",
    "since the ccd s charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) is a function of position , we used the prescription of whitmore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to calculate cte corrections .",
    "we calculated scaled _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 psfs using tinytim ( krist & hook 2004 ) for different filters , positions , and stellar types , before adding appropriately constructed artificial stars to the science images .",
    "to do so , we used the tinytim psfs to expand the point sources to extended sources ( @xmath17 pixels@xmath18 for the planetary camera chip , pc1 , and @xmath19 pixels@xmath18 for the wide field chips , wf1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "the artificial stars were uniformly spread across the images . to avoid interference between artificial stars",
    ", we only added 50 stars at any one time to a given chip .",
    "in addition , we ensured that each artificial star occupied a unique @xmath17 ( or , as appropriate , @xmath19 ) pixels@xmath18 subfield .",
    "finally , we used the same approach ( i.e. , identical to that used for the analysis of our science data ) to recover the added artificial stars from the artificial - star images .    an alternative method to perform artificial - star tests is based on adding stars to the catalog rather than the images ( hu et al .",
    "2010 ) . by applying this method",
    ", we do not need to use psfs to add artificial stars repeatedly to the images and reduce hundreds of thousands of artificial - star images .",
    "this will , therefore , potentially save much computation time . unlike while adding artificial stars to the images , the effects of superposition are automatically included .",
    "when we add artificial stars to the spatial - distribution diagram obtained from the catalog , we assume that if an artificial star is located at a distance from any real star of less than 2 pixels ( corresponding to the size of our aperture ) , it is ` blended . ' in this case , we simply add the fluxes of the artificial and real stars to recalculate the artificial star s magnitude and color . if the output artificial star is 0.752 mag ( or more ) brighter than the input value , it is assumed to be blended and rejected from the output artificial - star catalog .",
    "we performed extensive artificial - star experiments to test the validity of our assumption that stellar images centered within 2 pixels of each other can not be distinguished individually .",
    "to do so , we added sets of two artificial stars to a blank wf2 subfield ( i.e. , a subfield without any real stars detectable above the noise level , and with realistic noise characteristics ) .",
    "we adopted separations between both stars of @xmath20 , and 20 pixels .",
    "the resulting images , for a range of stellar - mass ratios , are shown in figs 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "we then performed photometry using hstphot and attempted to recover the fluxes of both stars .",
    "7 shows the magnitudes of the recovered artificial stars as a function of their separation , assuming input masses of @xmath21 for both .",
    "the recovered magnitude decreases rapidly for separations of less than 2 pixels and reaches a plateau beyond this separation .",
    "the difference between the combined flux at @xmath22 pixel and the recovered magnitudes for the individual artificial stars reaches 0.753 mag at @xmath23 pixels ( in the sense that they are fainter for this @xmath24 than when they are blended ) .",
    "this indicates that our assumption of a 2-pixel minimum separation to distinguish two stars individually is a good approximation .",
    "we also performed completeness tests .",
    "incompleteness of bright stars is dominated by superpositions in the crowded stellar environment of our observations , while for faint stars it is dominated by the instrument s detection limit .",
    "we adopted a gaussian - type photometric error for each artificial star ( see below ) , which was added to the spatial - distribution catalog .",
    "we also set a 50% completeness limit at @xmath7 mag .",
    "if the output artificial star is 0.752 mag ( or more ) brighter than the input value , the star is blended ; if its magnitude is fainter than @xmath7 mag , it can not be detected .",
    "9 shows the resulting completeness fraction , calculated by adding 10,000 artificial stars to both the catalog and the images at any one time .",
    "both incompleteness fractions agree fairly well for stars brighter than @xmath25 mag .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our new method is adequate for studying the binary fractions of stars that are at least @xmath26 mag brighter than the observational completeness limit . for fainter stars , our new method can not be applied with sufficient reliability to estimate completeness fractions .",
    "this is so , because by adding artificial stars to the catalog , the completeness fraction will be marginally higher than we would have measured from adding these stars to the images , because we do not take into account the presence of cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "therefore , although it offers a quick , first - order indication of a stellar sample s observational completeness , our method can not be used to calculate realistic , quantitative incompleteness fractions of real observational data .",
    "when adding artificial stars to the catalog , we assumed that the photometric errors are distributed in a gaussian manner .",
    "we obtain the relation between stellar magnitude and the corresponding errors from the catalog .",
    "we used an exponential function to fit the relation ( cf .",
    "2010 ) . to test this assumption",
    ", we added 500 artificial stars of the same mass to the raw images and subsequently recovered them using standard data - reduction techniques .",
    "10 shows the distribution of the differences between the input and output f555w magnitudes ( converted to @xmath11 ) .",
    "the mean photometric error is 0.017 mag , while the standard deviation of the distribution in fig .",
    "10 is 0.02 mag .",
    "thus , our assumption appears justified .",
    "modern computers are becoming ever faster .",
    "when bolte ( 1994 ) calculated the completeness fraction of his observations of m30 using artificial - star tests , it took him nearly one month of computation time on a sun workstation .",
    "now , such an experiment will only take a few hours on a personal computer .",
    "however , if we use artificial - star tests to estimate the binary fraction of a rich star cluster , we need on the order of 100 times more artificial stars ( @xmath27 ) for each run compared to the requirements for ( in)completeness tests . on an intel xeon e5430 server ,",
    "the computation time needed for data reduction _ only _",
    "( i.e. , not including the addition of artificial stars ) of a single _ hst_/wfpc2 footprint ( consisting of four frames of @xmath28 pixels@xmath18 ) is 1.2 min per core , which means that we need at least one month just for the data reduction if we were to perform artificial - star tests on the science images .",
    "for instance , to run our simulations for @xmath29 stars ( cf .",
    "hu et al . 2010 ) , we would need to generate 25,000 footprints ( each footprint would contain four times 50 artificial stars ) . in this case , the data - reduction time needed amounts to 21 days , i.e. , @xmath30 , for a single test ( e.g. , for a single value of the expected binary fraction in the cluster ) . on the other hand , by adding artificial stars to the catalog , we can ` recover ' as many stars as we need , and the total computation time is much shorter .",
    "for example , adding @xmath31 stars only requires 2 hours on a personal computer , again for a single test run .    based on extensive tests ,",
    "we conclude that adding artificial stars to the spatial - distribution diagram provided by the catalog and adopting a 2-pixel separation threshold for stellar blends provides a good approximation to reality .",
    "comparison of the ( in)completeness fractions obtained from both methods underscores our conclusion .",
    "estimating binary fractions of dense star clusters using artificial - star tests can safely be done by adding stars to the catalog rather than the images .",
    "the new method is much less time - consuming yet equivalent in performance to the old method .",
    "we note , however , that this method can only be used for observational data sets characterized by stable , well - defined psfs .",
    "this limits its application to space - based observations ; the psfs of ground - based observations depend not only on instrumental and detector characteristics , but also on time - varying atmospheric conditions ( ` seeing ' ) .",
