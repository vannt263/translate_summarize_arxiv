    "post - agb stars are in a transition stage between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and the planetary nebulae ( pn ) stage . during the early stage of post - agb evolution",
    "the star is obscured by material expelled during the agb phase ( the agb ejecta ) . as this ejecta slowly moves away from the central star , the optical depth decreases and",
    "the star can be detected in the optical .",
    "when the star reaches high enough temperatures , the agb ejecta is ionized and is observable as a planetary nebula .",
    "we have studied optically bright post - agb stars ( spectral type a to g supergiants ) which show circumstellar molecular line absorption ( c@xmath0 and cn , or ch@xmath1 ) or emission ( ch@xmath1 ) in their optical spectra .",
    "the radial velocities and low excitation temperatures of the molecules ( bakker et al .",
    "1996a , b ) identify them as circumstellar rather than photospheric or interstellar ( see also hrivnak 1995 ) .",
    "the excitation of c@xmath0 is generally described by rather high temperatures , @xmath6 k , whereas the cn excitation is found to be much lower , @xmath7 k. the reason for this difference is discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "the observed abundances and excitation of the molecules can lead to a determination of the mass - loss rate .",
    "we have used the c@xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) and cn ( @xmath9 ) data of hd  56126 to study optical depth effects by means of the curve of growth , and we present the first results of a survey to observe these optical molecular bands at high spectral resolution ( @xmath10 ) . our primary goal is to resolve the line profiles and to determine the doppler parameter @xmath11 and the chemical ( e.g. abundances ) and physical ( e.g. expansion velocities and temperatures ) conditions of the circumstellar shell .",
    "a curve of growth ( cog ) has been empirically determined for the @xmath12c@xmath12c phillips ( @xmath8 ) ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and the @xmath12c@xmath16n red system ( @xmath9 ) bands ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 ) of hd  56126 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "our motive for this investigation is to decide whether the assumption of optically thin lines for the weaker bands ( e.g. 3,0 ) is allowed .",
    "the equivalent widths are taken from the work of bakker et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) .",
    "the range of line oscillator strengths is @xmath18 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 to @xmath21 for c@xmath0 and cn , respectively .",
    "because three c@xmath0 phillips bands have been observed , the cog has for each lower energy level @xmath22 up to nine transitions ( a p , q , and r branch for each band ) .",
    "this redundancy allows the determination of the cog .",
    "all transitions from a given @xmath22 level are fitted to the cog by changing the column density of that level @xmath23 . for the cn red system",
    "the redundancy is higher due to spin - doublet splitting of the lower and upper electronic state and @xmath24-type doubling of the upper electronic state .",
    "there are twelve transitions from each @xmath25 level : six main and six satellite branches .",
    "three bands were used , which gives in total 36 allowed transitions per @xmath25 level ( @xmath26@xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .    after all observed @xmath22 ( or @xmath25 ) levels",
    "have been fitted to the cog ( fig .  1 , left panels )",
    "an optical - depth - corrected absolute rotational diagram ( fig .  1 , middle panels ) gives the absolute population for each @xmath22 ( or @xmath25 ) level . under the assumption of a boltzmann distribution , a linear fit to the diagram gives the average rotational temperature @xmath29 .",
    "finally the rotational temperature from two successive energy levels can be determined as a function of the lower energy level ( fig",
    ".  1 , right panels ) .",
    "the parameters derived from this analysis are given in table  1 .",
    "the empirical cog ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows clearly that the observations cover the optically - thin and saturated parts of the cog .",
    "the theoretical cog has a doppler parameter @xmath30  km s@xmath3 and @xmath31 is reached at an equivalent width of @xmath32 m .",
    "since the strongest lines in the ( 3,0 ) transitions of c@xmath0 and cn have equivalent width of 38 and 34 m , respectively , the optically thin approximation is only valid for the weaker lines in these bands .",
    "we note that all the lines of the c@xmath0 ( @xmath33 ) = ( 3,0 ) band seem to be offset with respect to the other lines .",
    "this might indicate that the band oscillator strength used is somewhat too low .",
    ".results from the curve of growth analysis of c@xmath0 and cn in the optical spectrum of hd  56126 [ cols=\"<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      hd  235858 has been observed at a resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "figure 3 shows a part of the spectrum which contains three different categories of molecular features .",
    "the broad absorption lines are due to photospheric cn ( @xmath35 k ) , the narrow absorption lines are circumstellar cn ( @xmath36 = 20k and @xmath37 p @xmath38 ) , and the three strongest features are telluric h@xmath0o .",
    "there is one photospheric atomic line ( n@xmath39 ) present in this spectrum .",
    "the circumstellar cn lines are not resolved . since zas et al .",
    "( 1995 ) did not notice photospheric cn absorption in their spectrum , it seems that this pulsating star has only photospheric molecular absorption when the stellar effective temperature is sufficient low ( when the star is largest ) .",
    "in an earlier report on the detection of circumstellar cn in iras  08005 - 2356 we reported the presence of only one broad component ( bakker et al .",
    "the new spectra ( fig .  3 , @xmath40 ) have resolved the broad component into two separate resolved components with a velocity separation of @xmath5 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the two absorption components could be due to wind material moving at two different velocities ( multiple shells ) , or to two photodissociation fronts at different expansion velocities  possibly one due to the stellar and one to the interstellar radiation field .",
    "we have investigated optical depth effect for the circumstellar c@xmath0 and cn lines in the optical spectrum of hd  56126 . from a curve of growth analysis",
    "we find a doppler parameter @xmath2 km s@xmath3 .",
