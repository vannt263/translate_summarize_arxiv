    "there is increasing evidence that there exist tight relationships between neuronal or genetic diseases and topological changes in brain connectivity or gene regulatory networks , respectively .",
    "however , the comparison between healthy versus disease networks can not be carried out directly by verifying for the presence or absence of each interaction , because there are topological differences within healthy people and also within patients .",
    "even people belonging to the same group present different neuronal or genetic topological features in their networks that make them unique .",
    "therefore , it becomes crucial to develop methods that are able to compare not just the topological features of the network , but that can verify whether two networks are generated by the same process or not . to this end , we developed statistical methods that succeeded in the identification of differences between typically developing children and those diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .",
    "the same set of methods was used to decide whether protein - protein interaction networks of different species are better described by erds - renyi , scale - free , or small - world networks .",
    "in the last decades , attempts to understand the mechanisms that determine the topology of complex real world networks using random graphs ( graphs that are generated by some random process ) has gained much attention @xcite .",
    "some examples of complex networks are the world wide web @xcite , human social networks @xcite , protein - protein interaction networks @xcite , metabolic networks @xcite , and brain connectivity networks @xcite . on studying these complex networks , some questions naturally arise .",
    "for example , how complex is a given random graph ?",
    "how different are two random graphs ? given a realization of a random graph , how can one infer which random graph processes generated it ? attempts to answer some of these questions have been made on purely theoretical grounds @xcite , but interestingly , to the best of our knowledge , no simple and robust procedure exists to answer these questions using empirical data sets . our aim in this work is to introduce such procedures .",
    "interactions are essential to understand complex systems where , to determine the behavior of the system , it is important to understand the way each component of the system interacts with others . for most classes of complex systems , interactions",
    "are neither invariant in time nor across systems from the same class .",
    "for example , neural networks in the cortex of the same individual can change in time , and synaptic organization is different among individuals .",
    "therefore , a search for an exact common network structure seems to be unfruitful .",
    "what seems to be invariant are some statistical features that can be reproduced in classes of random graphs ; therefore , the corresponding ensemble of random graphs can be used as a plausible model for an ensemble of cortical networks .",
    "two random graph models that are widely used to model natural phenomena are the scale - free @xcite and the small - world networks @xcite",
    ". the main characteristics of these random graphs are the non - trivial topological features that differ from the erds - rnyi random graphs @xcite , i.e. , complex networks present heavy tail in the degree distribution , high clustering coefficient , community , and hierarchical structures and short path lengths .",
    "usually , the scale - free network is characterized by its power - law degree distribution while the small - world network presents short path length and high clustering . however , although these characteristics are essential features of these random graphs , they are not sufficient to unambiguously identify a graph as belonging to a particular class . for example , small - world networks are highly clustered like regular lattices and have small characteristic path lengths like erds - rnyi random graphs .    in this work",
    "we propose that the random graph spectrum , i.e. , the ensemble average of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix , is a better and more general characterization of complex networks in comparison with other commonly used measures : number of edges , clustering coefficient , and average path length .",
    "for instance , it is known that several topological properties of a random graph , such as the number of walks , diameter , and cliques can be described by the spectrum of its adjacency matrix @xcite .",
    "based on this relationship between the topological properties of the random graph and its spectrum , we introduce the definition of entropy of a random graph spectrum and the kullback - leibler divergence between two random graph spectra . by simulation experiments , we observe that the entropy of random graph spectrum is related to the intuitive idea of amount of uncertainty of a random graph and that the kullback - leibler divergence between random graph spectra can discriminate two random graphs that were generated by different random process .",
    "statistical approaches such as model selection , parameter estimation , and hypothesis testing to discriminate two classes of random graphs are also presented .",
    "we illustrate practical use of the model selection approach in protein - protein interaction networks of eight different species . by analyzing the random graph spectrum instead of the degree distribution",
    ", we classified all the eight protein - protein interaction networks as scale - free graphs .",
    "finally , the power of kullback - leibler based statistical test is illustrated by an application in networks derived from children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and with typical development .",
    "we succeeded in the identification of topological changes between children with typical development and adhd patients , while standard measures such as number of edges , clustering coefficient and average path length failed .",

    "a random graph @xmath5 is a family of graphs , where each member of the family is generated by some probability law . among several classes of random graphs ,",
    "there are three that have known importance due to their capability to model real world events , namely , erds - rnyi random ( figure 1a ) @xcite , scale - free ( figure 1b ) @xcite , and small - world graphs ( figure 1c ) @xcite .     for the erds - rnyi , scaling exponent @xmath6 for the scale - free , and probability @xmath7 for the small - world random graphs ) . in ( a ) the entropy values estimated from the simulation data is depicted by a solid line and the theoretical value of the entropy computed using equation [ eq : theoent ] is indicated by a dashed line . ,",

    "erds and rnyi define a random graph as @xmath2 labeled nodes in which each pair of nodes @xmath8 is connected by an edge with a given probability @xmath9 .",
    "scale - free networks , proposed by barabsi and albert ( 1999 ) , have a power - law degree distribution due to node preferential attachment .",
    "barabsi and albert ( 1999 ) proposed the following construction of a scale - free network : start with a small number of @xmath10 nodes and at every time - step , add a new node with @xmath11 edges that link the new node to @xmath12 different nodes already present in the system .",
    "when choosing the nodes to which the new node connects , assume that the probability that a new node will be connected to node @xmath13 is proportional to the degree of node @xmath13 and the scaling exponent @xmath14 which indicates the order of the proportionality ( @xmath15 linear , @xmath16 quadratic and son on ) .",
    "small - world graphs , proposed by watts and strogatz ( 1998 ) are one - parameter models that interpolate between a regular lattice and an erds - rnyi random graph @xcite .",
    "first , a ring lattice with @xmath2 nodes is constructed , in which every node is connected to its first @xmath17 neighbors ( @xmath18 on either side ) .",
    "then , we choose a vertex and the edge that connects it to its nearest neighbor in a clockwise sense . with probability @xmath6",
    "we reconnect this edge to a vertex chosen uniformly at random over the entire ring .",
    "this process is repeated by moving clockwise around the ring , considering each vertex in turn until one lap is completed .",
    "next , the edges that connect vertices to their second - nearest neighbors clockwise are considered .",
    "as the previous step , each edge is randomly rewired with probability @xmath6 , and continue this process , circulating around the ring and proceeding outward to more distant neighbors after each lap , until each edge in the original lattice has been considered once @xcite .    any undirected graph @xmath19 with @xmath2 nodes can be represented by its adjacency matrix @xmath20 with @xmath21 elements @xmath22 , whose value is @xmath23 if nodes @xmath13 and @xmath24 are connected , and 0 otherwise",
    ". the _ spectrum _ of graph @xmath19 is the set of eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix @xmath20 .",
    "a graph with @xmath2 nodes has @xmath2 real eigenvalues @xmath25 .",
    "now , given a random graph @xmath5 , the eigenvalues are random vectors for which we can take the expectation with respect to the probability law of the random graph .",
    "we define the _ spectral density _ distribution of a random graph @xmath5 as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the dirac delta function and the brackets `` @xmath28 '' indicate the expectation with respect to the probability law of the random graph . in what follows ,",
    "we use the shorthand name spectrum of @xmath5 to indicate @xmath29 .",
    "the interest in spectral properties is related to the fact that the spectral density can be directly related to the graph s topological features @xcite .    in application , a closed form for the spectral density is rarely available , so we have to rely on some statistical estimators @xmath30 . in order to estimate the spectral densities , first the eigenvalues are computed , and then gaussian kernel regression using the nadaraya - watson estimator @xcite is applied for the regularization of the estimator . finally , the density is normalized to obtain the integral below the curve equal to one .",
    "the bandwidth of the kernel can be chosen by ( max(eigenvalues ) - min(eigenvalues))/number of bins @xcite , where the number of bins can be selected by using any objective criterion . in this work",
    ", we used the sturges criterion @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the study of spectral density distribution of complex networks is still an active area of research @xcite , but the aim has been in general to obtain the exact or approximate properties of spectrum distribution for a given model . in this article",
    ", we are instead concerned with their statistical properties and applications to crucial biological systems .",
    "first we will present the definitions of entropy and divergence for graphs spectra , along with statistical methods for estimation and significance testing . then",
    ", the performance of each method is evaluated by simulations and finally applied to actual data for illustration .",
    "let @xmath29 be the spectrum of a random graph @xmath5 .",
    "we define the _ spectral entropy _ @xmath31 as    @xmath32    where , as usual , we assume @xmath33 . observe that the entropy defined above is also known as differential entropy @xcite and can assume negative values , in contrast to the entropy defined for discrete distributions .",
    "since the spectral density of an adjacency matrix of a random graph has a tight relationship with the random graph structure and can be considered a fingerprint of the random graph @xcite , we propose that the corresponding spectral entropy also describes important characteristics of the random graph .",
    "more specifically , we propose that the spectral entropy measures a form of  uncertainty \" associated to the random graph . to gain some intuition , we can compute the approximate spectral entropy for the erds - rnyi random graph @xmath5 with parameter @xmath9 as follows . for large @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath34 for @xmath35 and 0 otherwise @xcite . using the above approximation",
    ", we have that @xmath36    this formula shows that the maximum spectral entropy for the erds - rnyi graph is achieved for @xmath37 , which is in accordance to the intuition that this is the model with the largest uncertainty . to confirm our point ,",
    "the erds - rnyi random graph spectral entropy was calculated for many different values of probability @xmath9 ( bottom panel figure 1a , dashed line ) . for the erds - rnyi graphs ,",
    "not surprisingly , the entropy achieved its maximum value on @xmath37 , and the minimum values on @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which is the situation where there is only one possible graph , i.e. , the empty and complete graphs , respectively ( figure 1a ) .",
    "furthermore , it is important to point out that the entropy function is symmetric due to the symmetry of the spectrum function , i.e. , the spectral density of the erds - rnyi graph generated with parameter @xmath9 is equal to the spectral density of the erds - rnyi graph generated with parameter @xmath40 .    for the scale - free and small - world networks ,",
    "an exact formula for the spectral entropy is not known , therefore , we estimated the entropy for different parameters of the models . a straightforward way to obtain an estimator @xmath41 for",
    "the spectral entropy is to first obtain an estimator @xmath42 of @xmath43 and plug in to the equation ( 2 ) .",
    "this is the procedure adopted in this work . to verify the accuracy of our estimator we compared the average estimated entropy values for 100 erds - rnyi random graphs with 500 nodes ( bottom panel figure 1a , solid line ) and the theoretical value in equation [ eq : theoent ] ( bottom panel figure 1a , dashed line ) .",
    "a visual inspection shows that the estimator is very accurate .",
    "the average bias for this example was @xmath44 , i.e. , a small negative bias .    for the scale - free graphs we observe ( figure 1b ) that the estimated entropy is higher in low scaling exponents ( @xmath14 ) because it becomes similar to an erds - rnyi random graph , whereas when the scaling exponent goes to infinity it becomes closer to a complete bipartite graph resulting in a lower entropy .",
    "finally , for small - world graphs ( figure 1c ) , the entropy is higher when the randomness of the graph ( probability @xmath45 ) increases .",
    "notice that when @xmath46 , the small - world graph becomes an erds - rnyi graph , whereas when @xmath47 the graph is a ring @xcite , therefore presenting lower entropy .",
    "for both scale - free and small - world graphs , the number of nodes and edges were set to 500 and 600 , respectively , and for each scaling exponent ( @xmath14 ) or probability ( @xmath45 ) , an average entropy of 100 graphs were calculated .",
    "once the spectral entropy is defined , one may introduce a measure of similarity between two spectral densities , which is also a measure of similarity between two random graphs .",
    "it is clear that if two spectral densities are different , then the respective graphs should be different , although the converse is not always true ( i.e. , there are non - isomorphic graphs which are isospectral ) .",
    "we define the _ kullback - leibler divergence _ ( for sake of brevity we call it kl divergence ) between two spectral densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 as    @xmath50    if the support of @xmath49 contains the support of @xmath48 . otherwise , @xmath51 . as usual , we assume @xmath52 .    for the above equation , @xmath53 is called the _ reference measure_. this divergence is asymmetric and non - negative .",
    "it is also zero if and only if @xmath54 and @xmath53 are equal .",
    "the kl divergence can be interpreted as a measure of discrepancy between two random graphs , thus can be used to build an estimator for the parameter of a model given an observation .",
    "specifically , let @xmath5 be a random graph with spectral density @xmath29 .",
    "also let @xmath55 be a parametric family of spectral distributions indexed by a real vector @xmath56 .",
    "assume that there exists a value of the parameter @xmath56 , which we denote @xmath57 that minimizes @xmath58 .",
    "an estimator @xmath59 of @xmath57 is given by    @xmath60    the idea is that among all possible choices of models in a parametric class of random graphs @xmath61 , we choose the one for which the corresponding spectral density minimizes the divergence with the non - parametrically estimated spectral density .",
    "this is in the same spirit as nonparametric likelihood estimators of which the whittle estimator is an example @xcite .    to show the performance of our estimator , different complex network models ( erds - rnyi , scale - free , and small - world ) with sizes equal to 50 , 100 , 200 , and 300 nodes were simulated .",
    "the parameters to be estimated for each random graph model are : the probability @xmath9 of connecting two nodes for erds - rnyi graphs , the scaling exponent of the preferential attachment @xmath14 for scale - free graphs , and the rewiring probability @xmath45 for small - world graphs .",
    "the estimated parameters were averaged values calculated for 50 repetitions , and the results are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "brackets indicate one standard deviation . from the results in table [ table1 ] ,",
    "we conclude that the estimator is reasonable and it can recover the correct parameter with relatively small bias and variance , i.e. , one or two order of magnitudes smaller than the value of the estimated parameter .",
    "we observe from table [ table1 ] and further simulations not shown here that the direction of the bias depend on the specific parameter of the model and size of the graph , and therefore no systematic bias direction seems to exist .",
    "the performance of the estimator is further discussed in section [ sec : discussion ]    .average parameters estimated by minimum distance estimator based on kl divergence for erds - rnyi random , scale - free , and small - world graphs .",
    "one standard deviations are indicated between brackets .",
    "calculations were carried out for 50 repetitions .",

    "findings of significant differences when doing this comparison will colorred possibly lead to the improvement of diagnostic , prognostic , and therapy .",
    "most of the network analyses are based on algorithms that identify punctual changes ( presence or absence of a certain edge ) in their node connectivity .",
    "however , in systems biology , different subjects with the same disease may display topologically different molecular networks or brain networks due to genetic variability rather than disease variability .",
    "therefore , a single graph will probably not be representative of the network ; instead , a class of graphs generated by a random mechanism seems to be more appropriate .",
    "this situation requires statistical procedures to analyze graphs .",
    "the difficulty is then to understand which parameter is representative of the class of graphs .",
    "the spectral distribution of a graph gives characteristics for ensemble of graphs generated by the random graphs , and the entropy of a spectrum and kullback - leibler divergence between spectra are natural information theoretical quantities to be studied .",
    "for some classes of graphs , the parameters of the model can be easily estimated .",
    "for example , the parameter @xmath9 of an erds - rnyi graph can be estimated by counting the edges and dividing it by the total number of possible edges of the graph @xmath62 . however , for more complex models such as the small - world graph proposed by watts and strogatz , it is not trivial to estimate the probability @xmath45 of edge permutation . here",
    ", we demonstrated that the estimator based on the kl minimum distance ( equation [ eq : est ] ) is a general and straightforward method that can be successfully applied to estimate parameters of diverse complex networks .",
    "one may argue whether the application of kl minimum distance estimator could not be applied to degree distribution instead of the graph spectrum .",
    "notice in figure 3 that the degree distribution showed a lower power to discriminate graphs generated by different parameters than the spectra .",
    "therefore , the spectrum might be a better feature to be analyzed than the degree in order to estimate the parameters .",
    "jeong and others @xcite were the first group to classify protein - protein interaction networks as scale - free graphs by analyzing the degree distribution .",
    "later , several other groups re - analyzed the degree distribution of protein - protein interaction networks and came to differing conclusions regarding whether it was appropriate to refer to these graphs as scale - free @xcite .",
    "one difficulty was the lack of an objective statistical procedure to decide which random graph model fits better the data set .    by applying our model selection approach",
    "it is possible to choose objectively , from a choice of candidate graph models , which model best fits the data . by our graph spectrum analysis , all the eight protein - protein interaction networks were classified as scale - free networks among erds - rnyi , scale - free , and small - world models .",
    "we notice that , in the simulation study , our model selection approach has correctly classified 100% of the graphs with 120 nodes and the protein - protein interaction networks analyzed here are larger than 700 nodes , which adds to the evidence that among these three candidate networks , the scale - free network seems to fit better .    despite these results ,",
    "it is important to notice that the model selection approach is an objective criterion to select the model that best fits the data _ among candidate models_. therefore , by analyzing the graph spectrum instead of the degree distribution , this study only provides one more evidence that , scale - free graphs fits better to protein - protein interaction networks than er and small - world networks .",
    "if another complex network model is proposed , one may use this approach to verify which one best fits the given graph .",
    "another point to be analyzed is the fact that , since only part of the protein - protein network is available , it is always possible that the observed sample is not representative of the entire network , consequently , resulting in a sampling artifact problem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is a problem about the original data set that should be addressed when the data is collected or by introduction of _ a priori _ model of the network .",
    "the analysis proposed here is conditioned to the quality of the data sets .",
    "our findings indicate that there are significant differences in the graph spectra of brain networks between children with and without adhd .",
    "we anticipate that future studies in the field of graph spectra may illuminate the topological significance of these features , and consequently help in the investigation of the relationship of these differences with brain function .",
    "the proposed approaches are flexible enough to allow generalizations to other arbitrarily sophisticated families of graphs . here",
    ", we limited the analysis to three well - known classes of random graphs , but the analysis can be extended to other graphs without restriction and it is applicable to many areas where network data is a source of concern .",
    "we present below the details of the computational experiments .",
    "the statistical analyses were done using custom made programs in r @xcite(language and environment for statistical computing and graphics ) .",
    "the r library _ igraph _ was used to generate the random graphs .",

    "the spectral densities ( @xmath29 ) of each graph were estimated by a gaussian kernel regression using the nadaraya - watson estimator . since the theoretical spectrum distribution ( @xmath61 ) is unknown for scale - free and small - world networks , the spectrum distribution was estimated by simulating 50 graphs and calculating the average spectra distribution ( @xmath65 ) as an approximation for the theoretical distribution ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "this is exactly done by sampling graphs spectra distributions from @xmath82 . in order to verify whether the bootstrap based statistical test is actually controlling the rate of false positives , p - value histograms under the null hypothesis were constructed .",

    "<S> the brain s structural and functional systems , protein - protein interaction , and gene networks are examples of biological systems that share some features of complex networks , such as highly connected nodes , modularity , and small - world topology . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies indicate that some pathologies present topological network alterations relative to norms seen in the general population . therefore , methods to discriminate the processes that generate the different classes of networks ( _ e.g. _ , normal and disease ) might be crucial for the diagnosis , prognosis , and treatment of the disease . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that several topological properties of a network ( graph ) can be described by the distribution of the spectrum of its adjacency matrix . moreover , large networks generated by the same random process have the same spectrum distribution , allowing us to use it as a  fingerprint \" . </S>",
    "<S> based on this relationship , we introduce and propose the entropy of a graph spectrum to measure the  uncertainty \" of a random graph and the kullback - leibler and jensen - shannon divergences between graph spectra to compare networks . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce general methods for model selection and network model parameter estimation , as well as a statistical procedure to test the nullity of divergence between two classes of complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods by applying them on ( 1 ) protein - protein interaction networks of different species and ( 2 ) on networks derived from children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) and typically developing children . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that scale - free networks best describe all the protein - protein interactions . </S>",
    "<S> also , we show that our proposed measures succeeded in the identification of topological changes in the network while other commonly used measures ( number of edges , clustering coefficient , average path length ) failed . </S>"
