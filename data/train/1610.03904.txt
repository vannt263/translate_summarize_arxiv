    "the laughlin wave function @xcite is a paradigm as a variational wave function @xcite .",
    "its construction is simple , yet its implication is rich . it not only explains the most robust fractional quantum hall effects @xcite , but also embodies many exotic notions like fractionally charged excitations , fractional statistics , and composite - fermions / bosons @xcite .",
    "its simplicity and fertileness make it very intriguing , and significant efforts have been dedicated to its nature @xcite . besides the conventional way of studying correlation functions , a more recent approach is studying the entanglement in the wave function @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bipartite entanglement entropy in the laughlin wave function has been studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "a noteworthy result is that , by studying the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy , the topological entropy corresponding to the so - called `` total quantum dimension '' @xcite is extracted , confirming the fact that the laughlin wave function is a topologically ordered state .",
    "however , a most natural way of quantifying the entanglement in the laughlin wave function has not yet been explored so far .",
    "it is well known that unlike the integer quantum hall effect , for the fractional quantum hall effect , the coulomb interaction between the electrons is essential . for a non - interacting fermionic system ,",
    "the multi - particle eigenstates are very simple  they are slater determinants @xcite , the simplest kind of fermionic wave function satisfying the antisymmetry condition . for a generic interacting fermionic system ,",
    "the interaction mixes up the slater determinants and a generic eigenstate @xmath2 can no longer be written in the form of a slater determinant @xcite , no matter how the single - particle orbitals are chosen .",
    "specifically , as we shall prove below , the laughlin wave function can not be written as a single slater determinant .",
    "now , from the point of view of approximation theory @xcite , a natural question is , how close can it be approximated by a slater determinant ?",
    "this question leads to the notion of the optimal slater approximation of a fermionic wave function @xcite , namely , the slater determinant which maximize the overlap @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes a slater determinant .",
    "denote the maximal value of @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "it takes values from the interval @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "apparently , the larger @xmath6 is , the closer the original wave function @xmath2 is to a slater determinant , and it is reasonable to say that the less the fermions are entangled with each other . in particular , if @xmath8 , the wave function is a slater determinant and the entanglement is zero .",
    "therefore , a measure of entanglement can be defined as @xmath9 this is a geometric measure of entanglement in the sense that it involves only the notion of inner product between two states in a hilbert space .",
    "it is a natural fermionic generalization of the geometric measure of entanglement for spin systems @xcite , or more precisely , composite systems whose hilbert space is the tensor product of that of its components .",
    "the point is that , for spin systems , a generic wave function has no symmetry and one uses separable states to approximate it ; while here for a system of identical fermions , the target wave function is always antisymmetric , and hence the simpler wave function used to approximate it should also be antisymmetric .",
    "we thus need to antisymmetrize a separable state and in doing so we get a slater determinant if not zero .",
    "we note that while the geometric entanglement of spin systems have been extensively studied ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , it is much less discussed for identical particles , although some works on symmetric spin states @xcite can be translated into the bosonic language too .",
    "the reason might be that the extra symmetry or antisymmetry constraint makes the optimization problem seemingly more complicated @xcite . despite this difficulty , however",
    ", recently some progress has been made on the fermionic case @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , an efficient algorithm to construct the optimal slater approximation of an arbitrary fermionic wave function was brought up .",
    "it is this algorithm that enables us to study the geometric entanglement in the laughlin wave function .    before proceeding to do so",
    ", we note that the advantage of the geometric entanglement to bipartite entanglements is that , it is intrinsic , because it involves no partition , neither of the space nor of the particles . by avoiding partitioning the space ( the modes ) ,",
    "it is representation - independent ; by avoiding partitioning the particles into two groups , it treats identical particles identically , i.e. , on an equal footing .",
    "in contrast , the schmidt decomposition based bipartite entanglement depends on the partition of the system , which is inevitably arbitrary .",
    "the algorithm we will utilize was already detailed in ref .  @xcite . here",
    "we sketch it briefly for the sake of completeness , and tailor it somehow for the specific problem .",
    "the laughlin wave function of @xmath10 electrons , in the dimensionless form , is ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 here @xmath13 is a positive odd integer and @xmath14 is a normalization factor . only the @xmath15 states are of interest ",
    "the @xmath16 state is simply a slater determinant @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on the @xmath17 and @xmath18 states .",
    "this is on the one hand due to the limitation of numerical resources and on the other hand because of the fact that the states with higher values of @xmath19 are less good as variational wave functions @xcite .    by construction ,",
    "each particle in the laughlin wave function ( [ lwf ] ) is in the lowest landau level .",
    "more specifically , @xmath20 here @xmath21 is an @xmath22-tuple with @xmath23 . in the second line ,",
    "we have introduced the single - particle orbitals ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 which are an orthonormal basis of the lowest landau level . by ( [ lwf2 ] ) , we see that @xmath26 is supported by the @xmath27-dimensional single - particle hilbert space of @xmath28 actually , it is readily seen that these first @xmath29 @xmath30 s are also the natural orbitals @xcite of @xmath31 and each of them has a nonzero population . because an @xmath22-particle slater - determinant wave function has exactly @xmath22 populated natural orbitals ( each of population 1 )",
    ", we see that the laughlin wave function with @xmath32 is not a slater determinant .",
    "the fact that @xmath26 is supported by a finite dimensional single - particle hilbert space greatly facilitates the numerical calculation .",
    "the @xmath22-electron hilbert space is spanned by the @xmath33 slater determinants @xmath34 with @xmath35 being an @xmath22-tuple .",
    "the laughlin wave function can be expanded in terms of these slater determinants as @xmath36 this expansion ( to determine the coefficients @xmath37 ) is highly nontrivial .",
    "but fortunately , some efficient algorithms , which we employ here , have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a generic slater determinant is supported by an @xmath22-dimensional subspace @xmath38 of @xmath39 .",
    "suppose @xmath40 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath41 .",
    "they are linearly related to the orthonormal basis @xmath42 of @xmath43 by a @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 the condition that @xmath47 be orthonormal requires that @xmath48 the @xmath49 identity matrix .",
    "the slater determinant constructed out of @xmath47 is @xmath50 choosing another basis of @xmath41 will yield the same wave function up to a global phase .",
    "the strategy to maximize the modulus of the overlap between @xmath51 and the laughlin wave function @xmath26 is very simple .",
    "we start from some initial orbitals @xmath47 chosen randomly , and then fix all but one of them and try to optimize it with respect to the rest orbitals .",
    "for example , let us fix orbitals @xmath52 and try to find an optimal @xmath53 with respect to them .",
    "we note that the inner product between @xmath4 and @xmath26 can be written as ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 here from the first line to the second line , we have used the fact that the wave function @xmath56 is antisymmetric and thus the @xmath57 terms summing over @xmath58 are all equal actually . from the second line to the third line , the integrals over @xmath59 were performed , and we have defined a single - particle state @xmath60 equation ( [ inner1 ] ) is in the form of the inner product of @xmath53 and @xmath61 . by the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we immediately see that the optimal @xmath62 should be proportional to @xmath63 . here an accidental and fortunate fact is that , @xmath61 is orthogonal to all @xmath64 because of the antisymmetry property of @xmath26 .",
    "hence , when we update @xmath62 , the orthonormal condition ( [ mm ] ) between the @xmath65 s is still maintained .",
    "the problem is then reduced to calculating @xmath61 . using ( [ expansion ] ) and ( [ gvsf ] ) , it is straightforward to get the compact formula @xmath66 we can then calculate @xmath63 using the laplace expansion @xcite for the determinant , and update the orbital @xmath53 , or more specifically , update the first column of @xmath67 . by doing so , the overlap @xmath5 increases .",
    "now the point is that , while @xmath53 has been chosen as the optimal one with respect to the rest @xmath68 orbitals , @xmath69 is not necessarily optimized with respect to its accompanying orbitals , namely @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we can turn to @xmath71 and update it in a similar way .",
    "this procedure can be repeated by sweeping across the @xmath22 orbitals ( the @xmath22 columns of @xmath67 ) in a circular way .",
    "the overlap increases after each update and surely will converge as it is upper bounded by unity . to make sure that we hit the global maximum instead of being trapped by some local one , the program has to be run dozens of times with different initial values of @xmath45 .    in fig .",
    "[ m3m5 ] , we present the geometric entanglement @xmath72 against the number of electrons , both for @xmath17 and @xmath73 . each data point is obtained with at least 30 different initial values of @xmath45 , and the columns of @xmath45 are updated at least for 40 rounds . out of the final values of @xmath5 , the maximal one is then taken as @xmath74 .",
    "we note that the @xmath17 case is surprisingly regular .",
    "first , all the points lie very close to a straight line .",
    "this linear behavior is not obvious at all , as we know that for the maximally entangled dicke state , in which half of the spins are up and half are down , @xmath75 is not linear in the number of spins but logarithm @xcite .",
    "second , even if @xmath75 is found to be linear asymptotically in the large @xmath10 limit ; in the small @xmath10 limit , deviation from this behavior is expected .",
    "that is , there should be some crossover regime .",
    "however , the linear behavior extends well down to the smallest possible value of @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath73 case is less regular .",
    "however , again there is no apparent crossover regime at the lower limit of @xmath77 .",
    "the pattern of the data points suggests using the linear least squares approximation to fit the data .",
    "that is , @xmath78 we get for @xmath17 , @xmath79 and for @xmath73 , @xmath80 in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that for some topologically ordered systems such as the toric code , double semion , color code , and quantum double models , the geometric entanglement , like the bipartite entanglement based on space partition , consists of a term proportional to @xmath22 plus a constant term called the topological entropy .",
    "if this is also the case for the laughlin wave function , we would have the constant term @xmath81 as @xmath82 for @xmath17 , and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "however , this is not the case as shown by ( [ m3 ] ) and ( [ m5 ] ) .",
    "actually , even the trend is in the wrong direction .",
    "in conclusion , we have used an iterative algorithm to find the optimal slater approximation of the laughlin wave function and in turn to calculate the geometric entanglement in it .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that the geometric entanglement in a strongly interacting fermionic system , which is of great physical interest , is calculated .",
    "the importance of the laughlin wave function warrants such a study .",
    "we find that the geometric entanglement @xmath75 scales linearly with the electron number @xmath10 .",
    "while this is not so surprising , it is unexpected that the linear behavior extends well down to the lower limit of @xmath85 . at the time being , a full understanding of this finding is still lacking .",
    "but , it is in alignment with the fact that the laughlin wave function has a very short correlation length ( it is on the order of the magnetic length ; or unity by our notation ) @xcite , which means that the @xmath85 case is already close to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the linear behavior of the geometric entanglement prompted us to compare the constant term with the expected topological entropy . as it turns out",
    ", they do not agree .",
    "this is in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the topological entropy can be successfully extracted from the scaling behavior of the geometric entanglement .",
    "our numerical result as a negative case then indicates that the relation between the geometric entanglement and the topological entropy is subtle .",
    "this is reasonable , as the geometric entanglement involves no spatial partition , to which the topological entropy pertains , at least in its original derivation @xcite .",

    "note that we are talking about the generic case .",
    "interaction does not necessarily mean the total wave function can not be written as a slater determinant .",
    "for example , for @xmath22 fermions in @xmath86 orbitals , the wave function is always a slater determinant , although superficially it is the linear superposition of @xmath86 slater determinants .",
