    "the standard behavior of electrical resistance includes more than one mechanism .",
    "matthiessen s rule states that these contributions additively form the total resistivity . in the spirit of this decoupling ,",
    "the standard contributions to the total resistivity are a temperature independent term from impurity scattering ( residual resistance ) , a quadratically scaling term from two - particle collisions ( fermi liquid ) , and a term from scattering of charge carriers off phonons which grows with @xmath0 ( bloch - grneisen ) below the debye temperature , while above this scale , this contribution scales linearly .    in the low - temperature regime ,",
    "phonon scattering can be neglected and the standard form of the electrical resistivity reduces to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the residual resistivity .",

    "a quadratic temperature scaling is usually considered as an identifying signature of a fermi - liquid ground state .",

    ". some of the best known examples of deviations from the standard scaling are the optimally doped high - temperature superconducting cuprates@xcite , the heavy - fermion compounds near quantum critical points@xcite , and the bilayer ruthenate sr@xmath4ru@xmath5o@xmath6 at the metamagnetic transition@xcite . in all of these compounds ,",
    "the resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence .    due to the recurrent interest in unconventional scaling laws , many attempts to explain the appearance of @xmath7 with @xmath8 have been presented@xcite .",
    "deviations from the standard fermi - liquid predictions can be found in a two - band model with a light band and a heavy band and strong impurity scattering close to a quantum critical point@xcite or in a strongly correlated system at high temperature beyond the existence of a quasiparticle peak in the spectral function@xcite . in our study",
    ", we address unconventional scaling of the resistivity in a single band model of a metal with well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "our numerical method enables us to go beyond a discussion of the resistivity in terms of a single relaxation time which , in the presence of anisotropy , is inadequate to describe the dissipation mechanism .",
    "furthermore , our method allows us to compute the resistivity at finite temperatures because the full energy dependence of the boltzmann equation is taken into account . in consequence",
    ", we study the temperature dependence of the resistivity without restriction to an asymptotic low - temperature behavior .    in a related study , we have used our method to show that the thermoelectric effect in simple models of correlated fermi liquids can deviate from the predictions of standard fermi - liquid theory@xcite .",
    "this unconventional behavior is a consequence of strongly anisotropic steady - state distribution functions .",
    "this anisotropy can be caused by geometric constraints for two - particle scattering or by strongly angular - dependent quasiparticle velocities .    in this paper",
    ", we present a numerical simulation of the resistivity of a two - dimensional fermi liquid on a lattice .",

    "this method is designed to study the resistivity as a function of the temperature beyond the single relaxation time approximation .",
    "we show that strongly anisotropic quasiparticle scattering and special scattering geometries can lead to robust deviations from the predictions of fermi - liquid theory and , in particular , that the temperature dependence of the resistivity can be strongly influenced by the band structure .",

    "disorder is simulated by isotropic delta - potential scatterers , which is a simple but adequate approach to model non - magnetic impurities .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the spin degeneracy of the electrons .",
    "the dispersion and the quasiparticle coupling are treated as phenomenological input in our model and , thus , already contain the renormalization effects due to the interactions of the bare particles .",
    "matching our calculations to an experiment would correspond to adjusting the dispersion parameters in order to approximate the low - energy states which can be experimentally accessed by , e.g. , angle - resolved - photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "this study is based on semiclassical boltzmann transport theory in the presence of an external electric field that drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "the relaxation of the quasiparticle distribution is described by the collision integral , an integration over all possible scattering processes weighted by the scattering rate .",

    "the electric field perturbs the system into a nonequilibrium state by transferring momentum to the distribution of quasiparticles . for a steady - state configuration to be realized ,",
    "momentum must thus be dissipated to the environment .",
    "one dissipative contribution arises from the interaction of the quasiparticles with lattice defects ( impurity scattering ) , in which momentum is exchanged between the quasiparticles and the lattice .",

    "it is reasonable to expect that an emerging linear term is present even for systems that approximately fulfill these special nesting conditions .",
    "in such a case , depending on the details of how good the nesting conditions are met , one can expect a competition between linear and quadratic terms .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistivityexamples ] ( b ) , a simulation of the resistivity of the half - filled particle - hole - symmetric system is shown .",
    "this plot convincingly demonstrates the linearity of the resistivity over a wide range of temperature , down to the lowest temperature of our study .",
    "it is important to point out the particular nesting conditions that are required to observe such a linear scaling of the effective scattering volume , which eventually leads to a linear resistivity . following our above argument",
    ", we conclude that scattering processes with linear growth of the corresponding effective scattering volume are present if the fermi surface exhibits segments that are parallel to one of the umklapp lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : umklappevent ] and have a symmetric counterpart defined by a reflection about the umklapp line . one can even allow for a displacement by a parallel shift along this umklapp line .",
    "if this condition applies only for a small part of the fermi surface , the majority of all scattering events can still lead to a normal , i.e. quadratic growth of the effective scattering volume .",
    "it depends on the exact form of the fermi surface and requires a numerical simulation to extract the scaling behavior quantitatively ; cf . the discussion about short - circuiting large scattering contributions in sec .",
    "[ subsec : closetothevanhovesingularity ] .",
    "it is , however , possible that such a nested fermi - surface segment leads to a deviation from the ideal fermi - liquid scaling .",
    "a special case is realized when the fermi surface fully coincides with the umklapp lines , i.e. the above criterion is fulfilled for the entire fermi surface . under this condition ,",
    "the umklapp scattering processes with linear growth of the effective scattering volume dominate the low - temperature transport and lead to a linear resistivity , as in the above example .",
    "so far , only the temperature dependence due to two - particle - scattering events has been discussed . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate how impurity scattering together with a strongly energy dependent density of states can also contribute to a nontrivial temperature dependence of the resistivity .    in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the divergence in the single - particle density of states is likely to be removed@xcite .",
    "however , because the following qualitative argument does not depend on the divergence of the density of states , we neglect the softening of the van hove singularity due to impurity scattering .",
    "we start with a qualitative discussion of the impurity - scattering - induced resistivity scaling in the vicinity of the van hove singularity . for simplicity , we consider the single - relaxation - time approximation , which has proven to be a good description of isotropic impurity scattering , @xmath54    according to the above qualitative expression of the conductivity , one needs to compare the density of states with the inverse dispersion gradient , @xmath55 , in order to determine if the conductivity is enhanced or reduced by a singularity in the density of states .",
    "this argument leads to @xmath56 where the average of the quasiparticle velocity @xmath57 is to be taken over the thermally activated quasiparticle states .",
    "equation implies that a peak in the density of states leads to a peak in the resistivity which corresponds to a dip in the conductivity .    in the vicinity of a peak in the density of states ,",
    "the relative number of excited states that are very close to the saddle points depends on the temperature . while at low temperature , these states represent a substantial contribution in the average of eq . , at higher temperature",
    ", more normal states are thermally activated and the effect of the states close to the saddle points is effectively reduced .",
    "this implies that the contribution of the states with very flat dispersion and consequently low velocities is suppressed with increasing temperature .",
    "thus , the conductivity increases with temperature , which represents a very unusual feature in the charge transport of metals .    taking the quasiparticle interactions into account , for sufficiently large temperature",
    ", the effect of two - particle scattering dominates the effect of impurity scattering and leads to an increasing resistivity , resembling the conventional trend .",
    "a resistivity that decreases at low temperature and then finally grows , inevitably has a minimum at finite temperature .    the numerical simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resistivityexamples ] ( c ) demonstrates that the presence of strong impurity scattering can lead to a minimum in the resistivity as a function of the temperature for band fillings close to a peak in the density of states .      for band fillings above the last umklapp edge ,",
