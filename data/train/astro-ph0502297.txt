    "it is generally accepted that long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with star forming regions ( paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "more specifically , they are related to supernovae ( sne)of type ic , the core collapse events of massive stars stripped of their hydrogen and helium envelopes ( filippenko 1997 , iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 , heger et al .",
    "2003 , stanek 2004 , stanek et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "while the sn / grb connection was gradually emerging , it was most clearly demonstrated by a recent grb030329 , associated with sn2003dh ( stanek et al .",
    "2003 , vanderspek et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we propose that there are two types of sne ic associated with grbs .",
    "one is a more or less spherical explosion as originally described by colgate ( 1968 ) , prior to the discovery of the first grbs ( klebesadel at al .",
    "the spherical model was refined ( chevalier and li 1999 , tan et al .",
    "2001 ) , and it may be relevant to events like sn1998bw / grb980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 , iwamoto et al . 1998 ) , and sn2001em ( stockdale et al . 2004 , 2005 ; bietenholtz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the other kind , with a strong ultra - relativistic jet , is a classical long grb , much more powerful in gamma - rays than the first type .",
    "the proposed bimodality , if real , will be verified with _ swift_.    we speculate about the physical reason for the difference between the two types of supernovae .",
    "we propose that the strong ultrarelativistic outflows are developed when the collapsing core becomes a quark star .",
    "these hypothetical stars are built of self - bound quark matter ( witten 1984 , haensel et al .",
    "1986 , alcock et al .",
    "1986 ) . the total energy released could range from @xmath0  erg ( cheng and dai 1996 ) to @xmath1  erg ( bombaci and datta 2000 ) , but we do not think that neutron star  strange star conversion is energetically decisive for sn ic . however , the formation of a baryon  quark membrane at the surface of the collapsed compact object is most essential .",
    "the membrane can be penetrated by photons , electrons , positrons , neutrinos and the magnetic fields , i.e. by various forms of ultrarelativistic flow .",
    "the idea of a baryon  quark membrane is crucial for the model proposed in this letter .",
    "such a membrane prevents baryon contamination of the energy outflow from a hot quark star , a property already used in a model of short grbs by haensel et .",
    "modeling of classical strong grbs by energy outflow from newly born quark star was previously suggested by several authors ( dai and lu 1998 , wang et al .",
    "2000 , ouyed and sannino 2002 , berezhiani et al .",
    "2003 , drago et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we shall outline the evolution to a supernova type ic in the next section , and we shall discuss the theoretical possibility of the formation of a quark star in section 3 . we shall conclude this letter with a discussion emphasizing the decisive role that _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) will play in verifying our speculations .",
    "the evolution leading to a formation of sn ic is agreed upon ( cf .",
    "lee et al .",
    "2000 , della valle 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "we need a massive star to be stripped of hydrogen and helium envelopes .",
    "this may happen to a single wolf - rayet ( wr ) star , or to a wr star in a close binary system . in the latter case the binary may be compact and tidally locked , with a rapid rotation as a consequence . when the star runs out of nuclear fuel the inner core collapses , ejecting a fair amount of @xmath2 , which is the dominant energy source for sne ic ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 , deng et al . 2005 ) , with up to @xmath3 erg of kinetic energy .",
    "the relativistic outflow from a gamma - ray burst is estimated to be @xmath4 erg ( frail et al . 2000 , berger et al .",
    "therefore , the energetics of a grb is only a relatively modest fraction of the sn ic explosion energy .",
    "what makes it extraordinary is the bulk lorentz factor of the ultrarelativistic component , estimated to be @xmath5 ( meszaros et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "as far as we can tell , the evolution as described in the last paragraph is not controversial . what is controversial is the nature of a collapsed object : is it a neutron star or a black hole , and even more controversially",
    ": what are physical processes capable of ejecting bulk matter at @xmath6 ? the common suggestions are neutrino ",
    "antineutrino annihilation ( woosley 1993 ) , and magnetic fields ( usov 1992 , kluniak and ruderman 1998 , lee et al .",
    "2000 , blandford 2002 , lyutikov and blandford 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "the details are very complicated , and it is not possible to prove or disprove those models .",
    "the large bulk lorenz factor is obtained by postulating suitable initial conditions , i.e. by replacing one puzzle with another .",
    "note that black holes are not a necessary condition for the formation of jets .",
    "models of magnetized neutron stars by leblanc and wilson ( 1970 ) demonstrated that they can form jets ; even more importantly it has been found observationally that crab and other compact stars do form jets ( mori et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "also note that neutron stars are formed out of stars with the initial mass as high as 50 @xmath7 ( kaper et al .",
    "1995 , clark et al .",
    "2002 , figer et al .",
    "2005 , gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "if a quark star is formed its surface separates the outside , where baryons can exist , from the inside where baryons are dissolved into quarks .",
    "the surface of a quark star separates baryonic matter from non - baryonic , it creates a membrane which may may be crossed only by electrons and positrons , photons , neutrino pairs , and magnetic fields , automatically generating conditions needed for an ultra - relativistic outflow of a classical grb .",
    "there is a price to be paid : we do not know if quark stars exist .    at this stage",
    "a theory is too complicated or too uncertain , but we may ask : how far can we proceed using semi - empirical evidence ?",
    "classical , powerful grbs are believed to be jet - like , and if we are not in their beam we shall not see a burst .",
    "perhaps the anomalously weak grb980425 was due to a jet which missed us .",
    "however , no evidence for a jet several years after the explosion makes this scenario unlikely ( waxman 2004 ) , and there is an emerging consensus that this was not a classical grb ( soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ) .    following the suggestion by paczyski ( 2001 ) and granot and loeb ( 2003 ) radio observations were done with very large array ( vla ) ( stockdale et al . 2004 , bietenholtz and bartel 2005 ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) ( stockdale et al .",
    "2005 ) to monitor an sn of type ic , sn2001em .",
    "while strong radio emission was clearly detected , there was no evidence of a relativistic jet .",
    "it appears to be the second case of a sn ic explosion which is not associated with a misaligned relativistic grb jet .",
    "some sne ic are clearly associated with relativistic grb jets , like grb030329/sn2003dh ( stanek et al .",
    "2003 , vanderspek et al . 2004 ) ) , for which the superluminal jet moving at ( 3 - 5)@xmath8 was observed by taylor et al .",
    "another good case of a grb / sn association was provided by grb031203/sn2003lw ( malesani et al .",
    "in addition several grb afterglows have very pronounced `` bumps '' in their light curves , providing photometric evidence of the underlying supernovae ( stanek et al .",
    "2005 , zeh 2005 ) .",
    "while this is only a preliminary conclusion it appears that the powerful sne ic come in two types : those which generate classical grbs with ultra - relativistic jets , and those which do not generate ultra - relativistic grb jets .",
    "note , the grb events without relativistic jets are natural ( colgate 1968 ) .",
    "its principle is very simple : a spherical explosion generates a shock wave which accelerates outer stellar shells to sub - relativistic velocity and generates a weak gamma - ray burst .",
    "what is extraordinary is the formation of powerful ultra - relativistic jets in some of these sn ic .",
    "what is the reason for this diversity , while the corresponding supernovae appear to be similar ?",
    "we suggest that the difference is due to formation of a core made of self - bound quark matter ( sqm ) in some of these explosive events .",
    "but we should keep in mind , however , the possibility that the bimodality of sne ic is due to the presence or absence of rotation .",
    "our suggestion of a bimodal distribution of sn ic properties is based on a small statistics : two and two events of each type .",
    "this may be improved with _",
    "swift_. according to norris ( 2002 , fig .",
    "5 ) there is a population of about 90 batse bursts which are relatively nearby , with a typical distance of @xmath9 100 mpc , which show a concentration to super galactic plane .",
    "they seem to be related to grb980425 .",
    "if some of these grbs were jet - like , but we were not in the beam , we should be able to detect their radio emission several years later ( paczyski 2001 , granot and loeb 2003 ) .",
    "the proposed emission from a decelerated jet was not detected in 1998bw ( soderberg et al .",
    "2004 ) or in 2001em ( stockdale 2004 , 2005 ; bietenholtz and bartel 2005 ) , but with a much larger number of batse grbs the radio emission should be detectable in at least some cases .",
    "the large batse error circles will not be a problem according to van gorkom ( 2005 ) and frail ( 2005 ) , as the radio sky shows relatively little variability , and the late grbs should stand out above the background .",
    "note that long - lag grbs contribute only @xmath10 percent at the bright end of batse luminosity function , but they dominate with 50 percent at the faint end ( cf .",
    "norris 2002 , fig 3 , 4 ) .",
    "their number counts are `` euclidean '' , i.e. they are definitely nearby , at least by cosmological standards . _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) will provide grb coordinates accurate to an arcminute and even arcsecond within a minute of the event .",
    "if the distribution discovered by norris ( 2002 ) holds then _ swift _ will provide grb / sn relation for many events and it will strengthen ( or weaken ) our proposal that some sn ic explosions are more or less spherical ( colgate 1968 ) , and some generate ultra - relativistic jets ( the classical grbs ) .",
    "as we have already mentioned in section 1 , the total energy @xmath11  erg released in the neutron star ",
    "quark star conversion is not very important for the energetics of sne ic . in our scenario",
    "the conversion energy is emitted after the supernova shock breakout , mostly in neutrinos . however ,",
    "if quark stars are formed then they are essential as a source of an ultra - relativistic outflow .",
    "a quark star surface acts as a membrane confining quarks to the stellar volume , which constitutes a huge bubble ( bag ) of the quantum chromodynamics vacuum .",
    "the membrane allows for absorption of baryons by sqm , where they dissolve into quarks . at temperatures under consideration",
    ", this membrane may be crossed only by electrons and positrons , photons , neutrino pairs and magnetic fields , automatically generating conditions needed for an ultrarelativistic outflow of classical grbs .",
    "the concept of an outflow from a compact star collimated into a narrow jet has been around for decades ( leblanc and wilson 1970 , mori et al .",
    "it is not to claim that the problem has been theoretically solved , but the relativistic outflow from a hypothetical quark star does not create any new problems .",
    "in fact , the relativistic outflow should be made easier with the generation of baryon free ejection .",
    "we do not propose to solve the collimation problem , as this is common to all grb models , and the presence of jets is supported by numerous observations ( cf .",
    "stanek et al . 1999 , and reference therein ) .",
    "we do not propose a novel solution for a sn explosion ; we know that sne explode .",
    "the issue we propose to solve with quark stars is the generation of ultrarelativistic outflows .",
    "we consider the formation of a hot quark star at the sn ic centre .",
    "the pre - sn fe - ni core collapses into a proto - neutron star .",
    "structure and evolution of proto - neutron stars has been recently studied by pons et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001a , 2001b ) , and its dynamics by villain et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ferrari et al .",
    "neutrinos trapped in dense matter enforce its high electron fraction ( @xmath12 percent ) , stiffen the equation of state , and prohibit the formation of hyperons .",
    "all these effects result in a relatively low central density ( @xmath13 ) , and a large radius of a proto - neutron star ( @xmath14 km ) .",
    "however , within a minute or so an excess of electron neutrinos diffuses out , and the electron fraction in the core falls to the usual @xmath15 percent .",
    "this deleptonization allows for the appearance of hyperons , which additionally softens the equation of state .",
    "the central density rises to @xmath16 , and temperature rises to some @xmath17  k : a hot neutron star is born .    just after the formation of hot dense neutron star the conditions at the ns center ( density @xmath18 and temperature @xmath19k , with a significant fraction of hyperons ) allow for the nucleation a quark matter nugget which then absorbs the whole neutron star within minutes ( olinto 1987 , heiselberg & pethick 1993 ) : a quark star is born .",
    "conversion of baryonic matter into sqm is strongly exothermic , releasing some @xmath20mev or more per absorbed baryon .",
    "most of that energy is lost in neutrino  anti - neutrino emission within fraction of a minute , just as it happens with the initial gravitational collapse when the hot neutron star had formed .",
    "conversion of the outer layers of a neutron star into sqm is facilitated by strong evaporation of nuclei into a neutron gas due to very high temperature .",
    "the newborn quark star is a huge reservoir of energy , including thermal energy of quarks , which for simplicity are assumed to be normal ( non - superconducting ) at the prevailing temperatures .",
    "quarks move freely within a huge bag constituting the quark star but they can not cross the confining bag surface .",
    "however , electrons and positrons , neutrinos , photons , and the magnetic field are not subject to strong interaction ; they can leave the quark bag which plays the rle of a membrane filtering pure energy from hot quark matter .",
    "this outflow of energy carrying zero baryon number can be a genuine progenitor of a grb associated with a sn ic .    the duration of the pure energy outflow from hot , rotating quark star is uncertain , and can be seconds or many minutes , depending on the relative importance of differential rotation and magnetic fields in the quark star energy sharing .",
    "the details of evolution of differentially rotating quark star are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the initial spectrum of grb near the quark surface is very specific ( usov 1998 , 2001 ; usov and page 2002 ) .",
    "however , the enormous optical depth modifies this original spectrum beyond recognition .",
    "we can not provide any spectral information that could be used as a direct diagnostic of quark star formation .",
    "our suggestion that gamma - ray burst are related to the formation of quark stars is mostly driven by the perceived difficulty in generating bulk lorenz factors as large as 300 , while at the same time keeping the energy density , and therefore the optical depth very large .",
    "notice that critique of the neutron - star  quark - star conversion model of grbs by fryer and woosley ( 1998 ) does not apply to our scenario .",
    "namely , in our case the phase transition occurs on a timescale much longer then the dynamic one , and therefore does not provoke an outgoing shock , which would load energy outflow too much with non - relativistic matter .",
    "we can not provide a proof that quark stars exist , but we have a hint : the apparent bi - modality of sn ic properties . some generate soft and weak bursts , like grb980425/sn1998bw , with no evidence for ultra - relativistic jets . some generate strong gamma - ray bursts with ultra - relativistic jets , like grb030329/sn2003dh . with pointing accuracy of _ swift _ , supernovae like 1998bw will be readily detected , following the breakout of a shock at the stellar surface .",
    "the time to the breakout is estimated to be approximately half a minute since the core collapse ( deng 2005 , private communication ; woosley 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "if the supernova generates a relativistic jet in our direction , the soft precursor caused by the breakout will be followed by a regular grb a minute or several minutes later , depending on poorly known details of a transition from a neutron star to a quark star ( olinto 1987 , heiselberg & pethick 1993 ) .",
    "swift should improve the statistics of sn ic , and the existence of precursors , and the issue : is there a bimodal distribution of sne ic will be observationally resolved .",
    "recent analysis of batse data by lazzati ( 2005 ) indicates that the precursors have already been detected , and if our interpretation is correct they offer evidence for the formation of quark stars following sn ic explosion .",
    "the time interval between the onset of a precursor and the beginning of the main grb , @xmath21 , can be used as a diagnostics for a transition from a hot neutron star to a hot quark star .",
    "needless to say , if the bi - modality is confirmed , we will be strongly motivated to develop details of our model , including the effects of quark superconductivity , and to use quantitative description of stellar rotation , formation and dissipation of magnetic field , as well as to describe the energy transport in a more detailed way .",
    "while we consider the quark star solution to the problem of sn ic bi - modality , we realize this may be a result of rotation , with high core angular velocity being responsible for the relativistic jets . the best argument we may offer in favor of quark stars at this time are the time lags discovered by lazzati ( 2005 ) , provided the reality of precursors",
    "is confirmed .",
    "the duration of grb activity , observed to be up to several minutes or more , may well be due to a gradual dissipation of a differential rotation by the magnetic fields .",
    "the infall of fresh nuclear matter following the initial core collapse may provide not only an input of angular momentum but also a supply of fresh baryons which will increase the mass of the quark star .",
    "ultimately , the quark star may collapse into a black hole , terminating the grb activity .",
    "_ swift _ may provide information about the time lag between the beginning of a strong grb activity and an arrival of a shock at the surface ( the breakout , or a precursor ) . with the present state of a theory",
    "it is not even possible to predict which may come first",
    ". it will be certainly important to find out observationally what is the relation between the ultra - relativistic jet and the breakout of a more or less spherical component of a sn ic explosion .",
    "can the two components be identified ?",
    "what is the time interval between them ?",
    "the distribution of long - lag grbs found by norris ( 2002 ) indicates that these may be associated with supernovae like 1998bw , and _ swift _ will be able to provide a definite answer to the question : are these grbs beamed away from us , or are they approximately spherical explosions as envisioned by colgate ( 1968 ) .",
    "it is somewhat disturbing that out of several dozen grbs detected with _",
    "swift _ , and half a dozen redshift determinations ( all with @xmath22 ) , not a single supernova was detected .",
    "given the dominance of long - lag grbs at the faint end of batse ( norris 2002 ) , and their `` euclidean '' counts , some of those were expected to be relatively nearby , and hence to produce easily detectable sne ic .",
    "while we can not be quantitative in our description of grb energetics and spectra , it appears to us that quark - star driven bursts are electromagnetic , rather than gas dynamical ; electromagnetic origin of grbs was proposed by blandford ( 2002 ) and lyutikov and blandford ( 2003 ) .     a problem with a standard grb model ,",
    "be it of a fireball or an electromagnetic type , is the need to separate baryons from energy .",
    "this includes kluzniak - ruderman ( 1998 ) and usov ( 1992 ) models .",
    "note that the strong magnetic fields are generated with a dynamo process .",
    "this can bring the field up to equipartition with kinetic energy of moving baryons , and makes the effective lorentz factor only slightly larger than 1 .",
    "it takes time to separate the field from the baryons .",
    "it is clear , that on a long enough time scale such a separation happens , as demonstrated by magnetospheres of radio pulsars .",
    "it is not obvious that the separation of magnetic energy from baryons can be done on a time scale of seconds , and proceed up to lorentz factor @xmath23 . in our scenario",
    "we begin with a baryon - free ultrarelativistic flow from a quark star , and we have to avoid mixing it with contaminating baryons .",
    "photons , electron - positron pairs , and magnetic fields are difficult to mix with baryons , and are likely to remain separated . in any case",
    "it is easier to maintain a relativistic flow then to separate this flow from baryons .",
    "we are very grateful to dr . j. deng and dr .",
    "s. e. woosley for providing us with an estimate of the time interval to the shock breakout at the surface of sn ic .",
    "we are most indebted to dr .",

    "we are grateful to dr .",
