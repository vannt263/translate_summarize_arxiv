    "the spin asymmetries relate to the helicity amplitudes as follows  @xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    for @xmath23 and @xmath24 some combination of measurements allows extraction of spin asymmetries from uncorrected for inefficiencies event numbers ( @xmath25 ) normalized by respective luminosities(@xmath26 ) .",

    "r0.4        the protons , which scatter elastically at small angles ( @xmath34 mrad ) , follow the optics of the rhic magnets and are detected by a system of detectors placed close to the beam inside movable vessels known as `` roman pots '' ( rps ) @xcite .",
    "the roman pot stations are located on either side of the star interaction point ( ip ) at 55.5 m and 58.5 m with horizontal and vertical insertions of the detectors , respectively .",
