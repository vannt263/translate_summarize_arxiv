    "classes i and ii are defined on the basis of associated sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; different pumping mechanisms are proposed for them ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the class ii masers are represented by 6.7 and 12.2  ghz lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spot size of class ii masers is several au ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the class i masers are resolved out with very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) technique @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations for astrometry with hydroxyl , water and methanol masers have been made using the phase referencing technique .",
    "the accuracy of measuring with hydroxyl masers is @xmath41  milli - arcsecond ( mas ) , while that achieved with water masers is up to a few tens of micro - arcsecond ( @xmath5as ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite also have achieved the positional accuracy of @xmath210  @xmath5as with methanol maser at 12.2  ghz .",
    "this observation has been the only one astrometric observation with methanol masers .",
    "internal proper motions are often measured typically at a few mas per year for water masers at 22  ghz ( e.g. , @xcite , ) and this motion sometimes prevents the separation of the annual parallax from the internal proper motion .",
    "the internal proper motion for class ii methanol masers are small and have been measured only for w3(oh ) at 12.2  ghz @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of 22  ghz water masers is sometimes too short for measuring annual parallax .",
    "for example , several spots disappear over timescales of 1 month for cepheus  a and iras  21391@xmath15802 ( @xcite , ; @xcite ) .",
    "a monitoring of variability of 6.7  ghz methanol line for four years showed that each spectral feature survives regardless of some variability @xcite , namely the lifetime of this maser is usually long enough for measuring annual parallax .",
    "there are 519 sites of 6.7  ghz methanol maser in a list compiled by .",
    "recently , new 48 sources have been detected using the 305  m arecibo radio telescope @xcite . for",
    "the above reasons , i.e. , compactness , small internal proper motion , long - life and large number of known sources , class ii methanol masers may also be a useful probe for astrometry .",
    "the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ; @xcite ) is a dedicated vlbi network for astrometry , which mainly observes galactic water masers for measuring their distance and motion .",
    "methanol masers at 6.7  ghz would also contribute to revealing the galactic structure as well as water masers .",
    "the spot size of methanol maser should be small enough for high precision astrometry .",
    "the study of spot size , however , have been made only a few cases so far .",
    "the number of sources imaged with baseline of @xmath650  m@xmath7 at 6.7  ghz were only four ( @xcite ; ; ; ) . discussed the size and structure of individual masing regions in detail based on their 12.2 and 6.7  ghz observations .",
    "they showed that the majority of the masing regions consist of a compact maser core surrounded by extended emission ( halo ) , and derived the core size of 2 to 20  au .",

    "the integrated flux density of the correlated spectra account for @xmath450  % of the total flux , and some of which account for more than 90  % . this high detection rate , flux recovery , and the small fringe spacing of 4  mas suggest that most of the methanol maser emission have compact structure .",
    "this result is consistent with a previous study for w3(oh ) by @xcite .",
    "we also showed that the correlated flux density at 50  m@xmath7 is typically 20  % of the total flux density .",
    "the size of maser spot inferred from the flux ratio varies from 2 to 30  au ( at a distance from 0.73 to 9  kpc of the sources ) .",
    "this is consistent with the core size of 2 to 20  au obtained by .",
    "the velocity range of typically 10  km  s@xmath10 @xcite is narrow compared to that of water masers . given this compactness and narrow velocity range as well as the known properties of long - life and small internal - motion ,",
    "this methanol maser line is suitable for astrometry with vlbi .    from the viewpoint of observation ,",
    "atomospheric fluctuation is a significant problem for observations at higher frequency .",
    "strong absorption by water vapor in the atomosphere makes observations relatively difficult at 22  ghz in summer .",
    "this would be a potential problem in measurement of annual parallax .",
    "this is not the case for 6.7  ghz observation .",
    "the astrometric vlbi observation uses continuum reference sources which are usually distant quasars .",
    "such continuum sources show power - law , decreasing spectra , and the flux density is larger at 6.7  ghz than that of 12.2  ghz or 22  ghz .",
    "this property makes the astrometric observations easier in terms of detectability of reference sources .",
    "the 6.7  ghz line might have some disadvantages due to its lower frequency in comparison with the 12.2  ghz line : the interstellar scintillation broadens the size of maser and reference sources .",
    "the interstellar broadening is stronger at lower frequency , and might affect to measure the precise position of the sources . also the ionospheric density fluctuation changes path - length , consequently affects phase measurement at lower frequency .",
    "these effects depend on frequency as @xmath51 , i.e. , affect 3.3 times larger for 6.7  ghz than for 12.2  ghz .",
    "although discussed that the interstellar broadening is not significant at a scale larger that 1  mas , we have to take account of these effects for astrometry .",
    "we have made a phase - referencing vlbi observation with the jvn and achieved that the positional accuracy of @xmath450  @xmath5as at 8.4  ghz and the image dynamic range of @xmath450 on a target @xcite .",
    "the bigradient phase referencing ( bpr ) was used for this observation , and a reference calibrator was separated by a from the target source . the following equation ( [ equ : equ1 ] )",
    "can be used to derive an accuracy @xmath52 of annual parallax , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the minimum fringe spacing , @xmath55 is dynamic range of the image , @xmath56 is the number of spots used in measuring annual parallax , and @xmath57 is the number of observations .",
    "if we make a series of observations for nine methanol maser spots for five epochs as in the cases of the observation by @xcite , it is expected that an accuracy of @xmath412  @xmath5as in annual parallax would be achieved .    the flux density at 6.7  ghz is typically @xmath210 times larger than that of 12.2  ghz @xcite , and the number of observable sources of 6.7  ghz is much larger than that of 12.2  ghz .",
    "this practical reason let us choose 6.7  ghz line than 12.2  ghz one .",
    "we have started to improve the jvn at 6.7  ghz in terms of sensitivity and the number of stations to detect weak masers and reference sources .",
    "usuda 64  m is one of the newly participating telescopes .",
    "assuming an aperture efficiency of 50  % and @xmath58 of 50  k for all telescopes , it is expected that sensitivity for fringe detection ( 7  @xmath14 ) would be less than 5  jy .",
    "we showed that the correlated flux density at 50  m@xmath3 is typically 20  % of the total flux density .",
    "hence , sources with total flux density of larger than 25  jy would be potential targets for astrometric observation . the number of such sources found in the catalog by is larger than 150 .",
    "the authors wish to thank the jvn team for observing assistance and support .",
    "the jvn project is led by the national astronomical observatory of japan  ( naoj ) that is a branch of the national institutes of natural sciences  ( nins ) , hokkaido university , gifu university , yamaguchi university , and kagoshima university , in cooperation with geographical survey institute  ( gsi ) , the japan aerospace exploration agency  ( jaxa ) , and the national institute of information and communications technology  ( nict ) ."
