    "the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the iron pnictides in 2008 @xcite has provided a new opportunity to study the intriguing interplay between superconductivity and magnetism , as the superconductivity in the fe - based superconductors was again found to emerge in close proximity to the magnetic instability,@xcite similar to that in cuprates and heavy - fermion compounds . among various classes of fe - based superconductors ,",
    "the ternary `` 122 '' family , @xmath13fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( @xmath13 = ba , sr , ca , etc ) has attracted more attention due to the relative high superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath5 ) and the ease in obtaining large , high - quality single crystals .",
