    "the splitting of the single eit window into double eit window as a function of the jaynes - cummings coupling @xmath17 is a consequence of the formation of the dressed state mediated by the single - photon state and the two - level atom @xcite .",
    "interestingly , double eit window can be transformed to single eit window if optomechanical coupling is gradually switched off .",

    ", there exists three roots in the present case .",
    "the third root occurs due to the presence of atom in the hybrid system .",
    "therefore , we found three peaks in the absorption profile , as in fig .",
    "[ eit2 ] . here",
    "each of the three roots depicts a maximum in double eit window .",
    "thus , analytically the structure of the output field confirms the splitting of single eit window into two distinct double eit windows .",
    "the two windows occur for large enough values of @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the atom contributes in the destructive interference , since @xmath99 .",
    "hence , the interference between four parties , namely ; atom , moving mirror , pump and probe fields respectively , corresponding to @xmath14 , @xmath8 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , causes the splitting of single eit window , and emergence of two distinct eit windows .",
    "therefore , dispersion in the output field changes from normal to anomalous .",
    "it is also worth noticing that analogous to the multi - level atomic systems , single - ended optomechanical systems share the properties of three - level atomic system , which leads to the occurrence of single eit window @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of double eit window requires an additional interfering pathway , and the hybrid optomechanical systems spectacularly meet this requirement , as they can share the properties of four ( or more ) level atomic systems @xcite .",
    "ugo fano @xcite in his quantum mechanical study of the autoionizing states of atoms , discovered that the quantum interference of different transition amplitudes leads to absorption profile which exhibits minima or zero .",
