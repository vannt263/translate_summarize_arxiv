    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnets under doping with non - magnetic impurities have emerged as interesting systems with rich possibilities to explore various disorder - driven phase transitions belonging to different universality classes.@xcite non - magnetic impurities ( vacancies ) enhance quantum fluctuation by reducing the connectivity of the spins .",
    "many earlier calculations @xcite for the 2d @xmath0 heisenberg model had indicated that the quantum fluctuation can become strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long - range order at a vacancy concentration @xmath20 less than the classical percolation threshold @xmath21whence @xmath20 would be a quantum critical point . however , more recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the diluted quantum heisenberg model,@xcite studies of effective classical systems , @xcite as well as experiments on la@xmath22cu@xmath23zn@xmath24o@xmath25 ( with non - magnetic zn substituting @xmath0 cu ions ) @xcite all suggest that long range order actually survives all the way up to the percolation point @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath26 for the single 2d layer .    the percolating cluster at @xmath21 is ordered,@xcite which implies that the static properties at the dilution - driven transition in the quantum heisenberg model scale as in the classical ( percolation ) problem . however , quantum fluctuations lead to changes in the low - energy spin dynamics . the critical exponents",
    "therefore in general depend on classical percolation exponents as well as the dynamic exponent @xmath10 of the quantum spin clusters.@xcite the dynamic exponent of the percolating cluster is therefore important , and the focus of this paper .",
    "the dynamic exponent governs the scaling of the gap @xmath6 between the ground state and the lowest excited state of a finite cluster . with @xmath4 denoting the cluster length ( defined in some suitable way for a random cluster with irregular shape ) , the gap scales , on average , as @xmath27 . for a clean @xmath28-dimensional antiferromagnetic system on a bipartite lattice with @xmath29 ( even ) sites ,",
    "every spin can be paired up with a nearest - neighbor spin on the opposite sublattice to effectively form a `` quantum rotor '' with angular momentum @xmath30 states . in the mapping to a quantum rotor model,@xcite these local degrees of freedom",
    "are replaced with angular momenta @xmath31 taking all integer values , with the high @xmath31 states suppressed due to their energy being @xmath32 .",
    "the ground state of the coupled quantum rotor system is a singlet . if the system is long - range ordered ( but the global rotational symmetry has not been broken by any external perturbation ) , then the low - energy excitations of the coupled rotors ( and the nel ordered spin system@xcite ) are those of a single quantum rotor with mass @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "according to one recently proposed scenario for randomly diluted antiferromagnets,@xcite the quantum rotor states remain the lowest - energy excitations even at @xmath21 , where the dimensionality @xmath36 of the percolating cluster is fractal ; @xmath37.@xcite following the discussion above , this would seem to require that each spin can be paired up into a dimer with one of its nearest neighbors to effectively form a quantum rotor with @xmath38 ground state .",
    "this situation can be realized in the special case of the dimer - diluted bilayer,@xcite in which two coupled layers are diluted exactly in the same way by removing inter - layer spin dimers .",
    "all the remaining spins can then be paired with spins on the opposite layer . at sufficiently weak inter - layer coupling ,",
    "the ground state of the largest connected cluster of spins in this system is long - range ordered for @xmath39,@xcite and , thus , the ground state should fall into the class of quantum rotor states with gap @xmath40 .",
    "however , in the case of a single diluted layer ( or a bilayer with inter - layer coupling @xmath41 ) , there are in general some `` dangling spins '' ( or more generally , regions with local sublattice imbalance ) in which not all spins can be simultaneously paired up into nearest - neighbor dimers .",
    "one may still be able to pair spins over longer distances ( which would also imply longer - range interactions between the rotors in the effective model ) , but at some point , when very long distances are required , the mapping to simple quantum rotors should break down .",
    "our assertion is that , at the percolation point , there are regions of spins that effectively form isolated magnetic moments , which can not be described within an effective model containing only coupled rotors .",
    "the spatial distribution of these moment regions , and weak effective interactions between them ( mediated by the magnetically inert parts of the percolating cluster ) , lead low - energy excitations which are dramatically different from those of the quantum rotor system .",
    "we introduced this scenario and presented supporting numerical evidence in a recent paper.@xcite using finite - size scaling , we found a considerably larger dynamic exponent than the quantum - rotor value ; @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 . here",
    "we provide more details of this work , and also expand significantly on the previous calculations .",
    "we use several different methods to indirectly and directly examine the low - energy excitations of different types of clusters , both at and away from the percolation point .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath42 for clusters at the percolation point is based largely on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations of an upper - bound @xmath5 to the lowest excitation gap @xmath6 for finite clusters with singlet ( @xmath8 ) ground states .",
    "the bound is defined using standard sum rules , discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ ssemethod ] [ and summarized as eqs .",
    "( [ gapbound ] ) , ( [ sumrule1 ] ) , and ( [ sumrule2 ] ) ] .",
    "the bound is exact , @xmath44 , for a spectrum with a single mode , and is known to scale with the system size in the same way as @xmath6 more generally , e.g. , in the clean heisenberg model.@xcite it can be evaluated for large clusters using qmc calculations , in contrast to the exact gap , which is difficult to evaluate directly ( because it is dominated by statistical errors if the gap is small ) .",
    "we also found that the probability distribution of local gaps @xmath45 ( also defined using a sum rule ) scales with the system size.@xcite defining @xmath46 ( where the exponent is determined from simulation data and is @xmath47 for @xmath8 clusters ) , the distribution @xmath48 is size - independent .",
    "moreover , the low - energy tail of this distribution is well described by a power - law , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 . analyzing the local gaps using extremal - value statistics",
    ", we found that the dynamic exponent should be related to the parameters of the local gap distribution according to @xmath51 .",
    "our simulation results satisfy this exponent relation remarkably well .",
    "the applicability of the exponent relation supports the notion that the low - energy excitations involve a number @xmath52 finite regions ( containing the effective moments ) , while an exponent @xmath53 shows that individual excitations are not localized ( since for localized excitations the energy should be independent of @xmath4 for large @xmath4 ) .",
    "the effective moments should be located in regions of imbalance in the number of spins on the two sublattices , and many moments can be involved in an excitation .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath54 reflects the way in which the weak interactions between the effective moments involved in a particular excitation decrease with increasing system size , as these moments become further separated from each other .    in this paper",
    ", we report scaling results for larger clusters than previously and also compare results for clusters constructed in different ways . on the bipartite square lattice ,",
    "we denote the number of sites on sublattice @xmath55 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the ground state has spin @xmath59 .",
    "we analyze in detail both @xmath8 and @xmath12 clusters at the percolation point @xmath21 .",
    "we use the gap upper - bound @xmath5 from sum rules , as well as lanczos exact diagonalization results for the excitation spectrum . for clusters with ground - state spin @xmath12 , we point out that the spectral weight entering in the sum - rule approach is dominated by @xmath15 excitations , whereas the lowest - energy excitations typically correspond to @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 in this case describes only excitations where @xmath15 , for which we find @xmath60 based on finite - size scaling .",
    "however , the lower @xmath14 excitations most likely follow the same @xmath42 scaling as the @xmath61 excitations of @xmath62 clusters .",
    "we also discuss results for the dimer - diluted bilayer at @xmath21 , as well as the single layer at @xmath18 . for these systems , we observe behavior consistent with quantum rotor excitations ( although other scenarios , e.g. , fractons,@xcite are also possible ) .    to explain the existence of localized moments in the percolating cluster , we also introduce a classical dimer - monomer aggregation model to study the purely geometrical local sublattice imbalance , which we believe is at the heart of this problem .",
    "the dimers correspond to nearest - neighbor sites that can form minimal local quantum rotors , and the monomers lead to `` dangling '' spins that are , due to local sublattice imbalance , left over after the maximum number of dimers has formed .",
    "the monomers , individual ones or groups of several of them , can lead to effective magnetic moments in the spin system .",
    "we find that the classical monomers indeed are confined within regions of finite size , both at and away from the percolation point .",
    "the anomalous dynamics with @xmath42 in the single - layer quantum spin system at @xmath21 should therefore be a consequence of localized quasi - free magnetic moments interacting very weakly because of the vanishing spin stiffness of the percolating cluster.@xcite away from the percolation point , the moments can lock to the global nel order of the cluster ( as a single magnetic impurity in two dimensional is known to do @xcite ) and do not form an effective independent low - energy system .    to further investigate the nature of the excitations of the quantum spins and their relationship to the classical monomers",
    ", we have also applied a projector qmc method in the valence bond basis  @xcite to directly study the triplet excitations of clusters with singlet ground states . in the valence bond basis",
    ", a triplet state can be described by a lone triplet bond ,",
    "the location of which fluctuates among the background singlet bonds .",
    "we find that the triplet bond is indeed predominantly localized at a subset of the classical monomer regions .",
    "the total size of the excitation ( i.e. , the number of spins involved in it ) is not finite , however , but grows with the cluster size according to a non - trivial power law .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . after defining the spin models and describing several computational methods in sec .",

    "the heisenberg hamiltonian on a single site - diluted layer is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes nearest neighbors on a 2d square lattice and @xmath66 ( vacancy ) and @xmath67 ( magnetic site ) with probability @xmath1 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "we study clusters with two types of boundary conditions . in open - boundary @xmath69 systems , we start with all magnetic sites and introduce vacancies with probability @xmath1 .",
    "we study the largest cluster of connected magnetic sites .",
    "the number of spins @xmath70 in such clusters fluctuates and scales as @xmath71 , with @xmath9 .",
    "we also study clusters grown on an infinite lattice . starting from a single magnetic site , we add more sites to the cluster with probability @xmath68 by transversing along the boundary sites , leaving sites unfilled with probability @xmath1 , but flagging each site as visited ( so that sites assigned as vacancies are not visited again ) .",
    "this procedure terminates at random at some stage where all neighbors of the cluster have been assigned as vacancies .",
    "we only keep clusters of some desired target size @xmath70 .",
    "these clusters have a characteristic average length @xmath72 ( defined , e.g. , as their radius of gyration ) such that @xmath73 .",
    "the two types of clusters will be referred to as @xmath69 and fixed-@xmath70 , respectively . in ref .  , we only studied fixed-@xmath70 clusters . here",
    "we also consider the @xmath69 variant to check whether the finite - size scaling properties depend on the boundary conditions in the cluster construction . for @xmath74 , we consider only the @xmath69 clusters , because the fixed-@xmath70 construction rarely terminates at reasonably small @xmath70 in this case .    under each type of boundary condition , we further consider two different ensembles of sublattice occupations ; @xmath62 , in which case all clusters have ground state spin @xmath8 , as well as arbitrary @xmath75 ( with the distribution give by the cluster construction ) , corresponding to ground state spin @xmath59 .",
    "the latter ensemble includes also the @xmath8 clusters .",
    "a bilayer cluster is constructed by coupling two identical single - layer clusters with an interlayer coupling constant @xmath76 .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus @xmath77 where the subscripts @xmath78 refer to the two layers .",
    "also in this case we can study @xmath69 or fixed-@xmath70 clusters , but , in contrast to the single layer , the ground state of a bilayer cluster is always a singlet because each spin can be paired with its neighbor in the opposite layer .",
    "we consider small coupling ratios @xmath79 , for which the ground state has long - range order.@xcite    here our main interest is in the the energy gap @xmath6 between the ground state and the first excited state , which in the case of an @xmath62 cluster is a singlet - triplet gap . for clusters with general @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , the lowest excitation can have total spin @xmath82 , or @xmath83 .",
    "in addition to the gap , the distribution of the spin @xmath84 of the lowest - energy excitation is also interesting",
    ". we will also study the localization properties of the excitations very explicitly , by formulating the problem in the valence bond basis and carrying out unbiased quantum monte carlo calculations of @xmath85 excitations of clusters with @xmath8 ground states .    to calculate the gaps",
    ", we use both direct and indirect ( approximate , through sum - rules ) estimates , using the methods discussed in secs .",
    "[ ed ] and [ ssemethod ] . in sec .",
    "[ ipr ] we will introduce the valence bond qmc scheme for directly imaging the spatial distribution of triplet excitations .      the most straight - forward approach is to diagonalize the hamiltonian numerically in sectors of different magnetization , @xmath86 using the lanczos method .",
    "however , for irregular clusters ( without lattice symmetries to exploit for block - diagonalization ) , this can be done in practice only for up to @xmath87 spins , due to the rapid growth of the matrix sizes with @xmath70 ( considering also that we have to average over a large number  typically thousands  of random cluster realizations ) .",
    "nevertheless , such calculations are very useful and give some important insights into the role of `` dangling '' spins in low - energy excitations .",
    "in addition to studying the level spectrum , focusing on a few low - lying states and calculating their total spin to classify the excitations , we also compute the full dynamic spin structure factor ( in the standard way with the lanczos method , as described , e.g. , in ref .  ) ; @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fourier transform of the spin operators ; @xmath90 in a clean heisenberg antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice , the lowest excitation is a triplet at @xmath91 .",
    "we can use this wave - vector also for the diluted system , although the momentum is no longer conserved , i.e. , the energy eigenstates @xmath92 in ( [ dynamicss ] ) are not classified by the quantum number @xmath93 , but the spin operators @xmath89 are still completely well defined .",
    "we expect @xmath94 to exhibit the largest spectral weight for the low - energy excitations , since these should involve out - of - phase fluctuations of neighboring spins . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ generals ] , the dynamic structure factor is of great utility in judging the validity of our sum - rule based approach for an upper - bound of the energy gap , which we discuss next .",
    "we use the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) qmc method @xcite to calculate quantities which are closely related to the gap .",
    "an upper - bound @xmath5 to the ground state energy gap @xmath6 can be obtained using the static spin structure factor @xmath95 and susceptibility @xmath96 at the staggered wave - vector @xmath97 ; @xmath98 this bound follows from the well - known sum - rules ; @xmath99 which , in the way written here , are valid at temperature @xmath100 . in a system with a sole triplet mode ( a hypothetical situation ) with energy @xmath101",
    ", we get @xmath102 .",
    "any spectral weight above this lowest mode will render the ratio larger than @xmath101 . for a clean system ,",
    "the lowest quantum rotor state is at @xmath97 ( whereas at other wave - vectors spin - waves are the lowest excitations ) . as we discussed above",
    ", we expect @xmath97 to be the best choice for examining low - energy excitations also in the diluted system , and we here focus exclusively on this case .",
    "the staggered structure factor and susceptibility can be efficiently calculated with the sse method with `` operator - loop '' updates.@xcite using the standard definitions , for a given cluster of @xmath70 sites the static staggered structure factor is @xmath103 and the corresponding susceptibility is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "disorder averages are subsequently calculated for the ratio in ( [ gapbound ] ) ( where , it should be stressed , we first evaluate the ratio separately for each cluster , in order to obtain the gap bound specifically for each of them , and then take the average ) using , typically , thousands of random realizations of either the largest cluster on @xmath69 lattices or fixed-@xmath70 clusters .    for a clean heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath5 is known@xcite to scale with the system size as the true gap ; @xmath106 .",
    "this is because the dominant spectral weight is at the very lowest excitation energy ",
    "the spectral function in the thermodynamic limit has a delta - function at the lowest energy , followed by a continuum at higher energies .",
    "we expect similar spectral features in the percolating cluster and suspect that @xmath5 should scale as @xmath6 ( and will show supporting numerical results in the next section ) . at the very least , _",
    "if the true power - law behavior is @xmath107 , then the value @xmath108 extracted from finite - size scaling of @xmath5 must be a lower bound to the true dynamic exponent_. actually , in sec .",
    "[ moredata ] we will use lanczos results for the dynamic structure factor on small clusters to show that the finite - size scaling of @xmath5 _ does not _ reflect the true lowest - energy excitations in the case of @xmath12 clusters , but all indications are that the sum - rule approach is valid for @xmath8 clusters .    we will also study an effective local ( site - dependent ) excitation gap @xmath109 which is analogous to the gap bound ( [ gapbound ] ) but here the `` local structure factor '' is just a constant ; @xmath110 .",
    "the local susceptibility @xmath111 is defined as @xmath112 although the imaginary - time dependent correlation function @xmath113 is asymptotically , for @xmath114 , dominated by the lowest excitation , in practice the integral will be dominated by the excitation(s ) which predominantly affects the given site @xmath115 . for a disordered system",
    ", different sites can be affected by different excitations , and @xmath45 then represents a typical energy scale of excitations affecting spin @xmath115 .",
    "we should note that for clusters with ground state spin @xmath12 , the grand - canonical sse method samples over all magnetization sectors @xmath116.@xcite we therefore have to subtract the static @xmath117 contributions in eqs .",

    "( [ localx ] ) we subtract @xmath119 computed in the different @xmath118 sectors and averaged over all @xmath118 .",
    "the sse method operates at @xmath120 , but we can achieve the @xmath121 limit by choosing @xmath122 sufficiently low for all quantities of interest to converge .",
    "we use a `` @xmath123 doubling '' procedure,@xcite in which the inverse temperature is successively doubled until there is no longer any detectable dependence of calculated quantities on @xmath123 . since the dynamic exponent is large , the temperature @xmath124 has to be very low indeed for large clusters . as an example of the ultra - low temperatures required , the largest @xmath123 we use for @xmath125 clusters with @xmath8 is @xmath126 .",
    "since the simulation ( cpu ) time and memory usage scale essentially linearly in both @xmath123 and @xmath70 , these calculations are quite demanding .",
    "fortunately , the sse code for the isotropic heisenberg model can be effectively parallelized,@xcite and we have run most of the simulations on a massively parallel computer very well suited for these calculations.@xcite    when studying disorder averaged static properties , the sse runs for each individual cluster can be rather short .",
    "as long as each run is properly equilibrated ( for which the @xmath123-doubling procedure also helps @xcite ) , the average over many realizations will give an unbiased estimate to any simple average , e.g. , a spin correlation function .",
    "however , when computing nonlinear functions involving several quantities , such as the ratio ( [ gapbound ] ) , the statistical errors introduce a bias .",
    "it is therefore important to collect sufficient statistics for the individual clusters .",
    "we have compared results of runs of different lengths in order to make sure that the results presented here do not suffer from significant bias effects .      to study the nature of the lowest triplet excitation of clusters with @xmath8 ground states , we apply a valence bond projector monte carlo method.@xcite this method has been described in detail in recent papers @xcite and we here only review the elements necessary to understand the way we can access the triplet excitations and study their spatial distribution on the clusters .",
    "first , consider the singlet ground state @xmath127 , which we want to project out from a singlet `` trial '' state @xmath128 .",
    "the latter has an expansion in all singlet energy eigenstates ; @xmath129 in the standard way , if the ground state energy is the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian which is the largest in magnitude , which can always be assured by subtracting a constant from @xmath130 ( which we assume has been done , if necessary ) , the ground state can be projected out by applying a high power of @xmath130 to the trial state ; @xmath131 where we include the minus sign because normally @xmath132 . for large @xmath133 all the excited states",

    "the trial state is thus expressed in this over - complete basis as @xmath138 where @xmath139 labels all the different tilings of the cluster into valence bonds , of which there are @xmath140 , and we have introduced the short - hand notation @xmath141 for a valence - bond basis state .    for a trial state in a ground state projector calculation , it is convenient to use an amplitude product state,@xcite where the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 is the number of bonds of size @xmath145 in the configuration , i.e. , the length of the bond is @xmath146 . note that it is not necessary to normalize the trial state .    for the clean 2d system ,",
    "the optimal amplitudes are translationally invariant and decay as @xmath147.@xcite for random clusters , the optimal amplitudes are naturally not translationally invariant . while the average bond probabilities ( which are related to the amplitudes ) decay with @xmath148 , for any given cluster there are typically some regions spanned by long bonds ( a feature intimately connected with the low - energy physics , as we will discuss in secs .  [ spectralsection ] and [ rvbqmc ] ) .",
    "one could in principle optimize all the @xmath149 different amplitudes for each specific cluster .",
    "however , the effort involved in individual optimizations for hundreds or thousands of clusters does not necessarily pay off , compared to just projecting the trial state with a somewhat larger power @xmath133 of @xmath130 .",
    "we here use a very simple trial state with all @xmath150 .    to carry out the projection using monte carlo sampling , we write the @xmath0 heisenberg hamiltonian in terms of singlet projection operators on all the pairs @xmath151 of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath152 ; @xmath153 and",

    "simple sampling procedures for the operator strings and trial state bonds are described in refs .  .",
    "more efficient sampling methods have been developed recently,@xcite which we use but do not discuss here .",

    "this is also confirmed directly by imaging the spatial distribution of the triplet excitations in the valence bond basis , where the triplet state can be described in terms of a pair of spins forming a triplet in a `` singlet soup '' of valance bonds .",
    "the triplet bond fluctuates between several isolated regions , and its average length scales as a power of the cluster size .",
    "the average number of spins affected by the excitation also grows as a power @xmath394 of the system size , with @xmath395 .",
    "the excitations are thus localized at multiple moment regions , which are spread out over the cluster .",
    "all these results lead to a picture of an effective low - energy system consisting of a network of globally entangled local moments , where the moments correspond to regions of sublattice imbalance .",
    "we have introduced a quantitative measure of sublattice imbalance , in terms of a classical dimer - monomer aggregation model .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this model show that the monomers form isolated finite regions , and the number of such regions scales linearly in the cluster size @xmath70 . sites with a high triplet concentration coincide very well with high monomer density , confirming directly that sublattice imbalance in the heisenberg model is associated with the formation of weakly interacting effective moments .",
    "we have also shown that when two identical clusters are coupled in a bilayer , with a small inter - layer coupling @xmath396 ( smaller than the value at which the long - range order vanishes  @xcite ) , the low - energy excitations change dramatically . a finite - size scaling analysis for clusters with @xmath397",
    "show a much smaller dynamic exponent , @xmath17 , than for the single - layer clusters .",
    "there is no sublattice imbalance in this `` dimer diluted '' bilayer model , and the results therefore provide additional evidence for the important role played by effective moments at imbalanced regions in the single - layer clusters .",
    "the result @xmath261 was obtained by studying clusters in which the sublattices are balanced globally , i.e. , the ground state spin is @xmath8 .",
    "we have also pointed out that for clusters with global imbalance in the sublattice occupation ( leading to @xmath12 ) , the dynamic structure factor has spectral weight predominantly arising from the @xmath398 channel , while there is very little weight in the @xmath307 and @xmath399 channels ( apart from the elastic @xmath307 weight ) .",
    "experiments directly probing the inelastic spectral weight , e.g. , neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance , should be dominated by the @xmath398 channel , and @xmath197 should be typically large ( @xmath400 ) for random clusters .",
    "for this situation our sum rule method gives a smaller effective dynamic exponent , @xmath401 , than for the @xmath61 excitations of globally balanced clusters .",
    "the lowest - energy excitations , which are in the @xmath399 channel , are not accessible with the sum rule approach .",
    "we have argued , based on an analysis of approximate ( variational ) valence bond states , that their energy should scale with the same @xmath402 as in the case of @xmath403 excitations .",
    "there have been attempts previously to determine the dynamic exponent of the diluted heisenberg model based on quantum monte carlo calculations .",
    "_ studied the temperature dependence of the correlation length and concluded that it scales in a way consistent with @xmath43 at the percolation point.@xcite however , the scaling assumption was one corresponding to quantum - criticality , which may not apply because the percolating cluster at @xmath100 does not have quantum critical fluctuations in the sense of power - law decaying correlation functions .",
    "a similar treatment of the clean 2d heisenberg model would fail to give @xmath35 ( which is not a quantum - critical exponent but one characteristic of the quantum - rotor excitations of the nel state ) , because the correlation length diverges exponentially as @xmath121.@xcite    we have here focused exclusively on the dynamics of the percolating cluster . in order to relate the results quantitatively to specific experiments , one should include the contributions from all clusters .",
    "the cluster distribution is given by classical percolation theory,@xcite which can be combined with the finite - size scaling properties that we have found here for the distributions of the local and smallest gaps .",
    "we have also not discussed the consequences of our @xmath100 results for the @xmath120 behavior .",
    "this is of course also an important experimental issue , and will be interesting to consider in future studies .    moving away from the percolation point @xmath21 ,",
    "our calculations show that the dynamic exponent of the single layer is @xmath404",
    ". however , the classical dimer - monomer model has finite localized monomer regions also away from the percolation point .",
    "this suggests that the change in the spin dynamics upon moving away from @xmath21 is related to the effective interactions between the moment regions , not the disappearance of the moments .",
    "such a qualitative change in the interaction aspects of the moments is not completely unexpected , since the spin stiffness of the percolating cluster at @xmath21 is strictly zero in the thermodynamic limit @xcite ( although the cluster is ordered ) , whereas it becomes finite ( according to a power - law ) away from the percolation point .",
    "the more robust cluster order for @xmath74 should qualitatively change the effective interactions between distant monomer regions , likely locking all of them to the global nel vector ( which is the case for a single moment in a 2d system @xcite ) .",
    "the effectively independent nature of the magnetic moments exactly at the percolation point ( and the very weak interactions between them , are thus intimately related to the fractal structure and related vanishing spin stiffness of the network connecting the moment regions .",
    "we presented some results showing the cross - over from scaling controlled by the percolation point to 2d behavior .    in spite of the close agreement with the dynamic exponent expected based on the quantum rotor mechanism @xcite for the single layer away from @xmath21 and the bilayer at @xmath21 ,",
    "it is still not certain that the lowest - energy excitations in these systems are quantum rotor states . over the years",
    "there have been considerable efforts to understand the dynamics of various randomly diluted systems close to and at the percolation point .",
    "the `` fracton '' has been introduced as a generic excitation which develops out of plane waves ( e.g. , spin waves for an antiferromagnet ) for a translationally invariant system upon dilution.@xcite numerical calculations based on spinwave theory show that the dynamic exponents for fractons in the 2d percolating antiferromagnet is very close to @xmath36.@xcite this calculation does not properly account for the vanishing spin stiffness of the percolating cluster at @xmath21 and the existence of localized moments , but it may still be valid close to the percolation point ( where a finite stiffness develops ) .",
    "it is possible that the dynamic exponents @xmath405 and @xmath17 that we have obtained here for the single layer with @xmath18 and the bilayer at @xmath21 , respectively , are due to fractons , not quantum rotors .",
    "however , exactly at the percolation point , the physics of the globally entangled local moments that we have discussed here is clearly different from fractons ( which can exist in systems that do not have any objects corresponding to localized moments ) and the value of the dynamic exponent is twice that expected based on fractons.@xcite it is thus possible that several types of excitations co - exist at and close to the percolation point ; quantum rotors , fractons , and the globally entangled moment excitations .",
    "one may still be able to describe the low - energy physics of the system away from the percolation point as a network of weakly interacting moments , but now in the presence of a staggered field mimicking the coupling to a common nel vector ( i.e. , the sign of the field depends on which sublattice a moment is associated with on the original lattice ) .",
    "the strength of the effective staggered field ( which for a finite cluster should be allowed to have a fluctuating direction as well @xcite ) should increase upon moving away from the percolation point ( being @xmath286 at @xmath21 , due to the vanishing spin stiffness  the energy scale of twisting the nel order globally ) .",
    "most likely , even an infinitesimal field will asymptotically ( for large clusters ) change the dynamic exponent .",
    "the role of effectively isolated spins in the formation of long - range order @xcite on the percolating cluster has been pointed out by bray - ali et al .",
    "@xcite although some spins can be very weakly coupled ( effectively ) to the rest of the cluster , correlations between them can be stronger than within the backbone of the cluster .",
    "arbitrarily weakly coupled moments formed by groups of spins can also correlate over long distances , and hence even a `` floppy '' fractal cluster ( one with vanishing spin - stiffness ) can order at @xmath100 .",
    "this picture seemingly contains some of the ingredients of our entangled moments picture .",
    "however , the same ordering mechanism was argued to apply both to antiferromagnets and systems of coupled quantum rotors , whereas we have shown here that the bilayer ( which should correspond more closely the coupled rotor system , since there is no sublattice imbalance ) and the single layer behave dramatically different .",
    "since the excitations of the single layer cluster are also much lower in energy than the quantum rotor states considered in previous discussions of the dynamic exponent,@xcite a theoretical treatment within a quantum rotor picture is clearly not adequate . in refs .   and",
    "the excitations of the diluted system were analyzed using spin - wave theory , but this method also does not capture the significance of almost isolated moments and their long - range global entanglement , and no unusually low energy scale was discussed .    in field - theory language ,",
    "the `` dangling '' spins , or regions of sublattice imbalance , that we have discussed here correspond to uncompensated berry phases.@xcite although it is quite clear that these should exist in diluted quantum antiferromagnets , how to properly take them into account in analytical calculations for these systems is not well understood . to our knowledge ,",
    "the resulting globally entangled moments excitations that we have argued for here have not been discussed previously in the literature .",
    "the effective low - energy system is similar to the random antiferromagnet considered by bhatt and lee , @xcite and also by sachdev and ye.@xcite however , there is an important difference in that the nearest - neighbor interactions in our system are not frustrated .",
    "an effective low - energy hamiltonian should then also not be frustrated .",
    "the bhatt - lee calculation @xcite was focused on the thermodynamic properties and did not address the dynamic exponent .",
    "the method applied was a generalization of the strong disorder renormalization ( singlet decimation ) scheme by ma , dasgupta , and hu,@xcite which has been applied to numerous random antiferromagnetic heisenberg systems.@xcite it would be interesting to apply this method also to the diluted clusters .",
    "however , there is a technical problem in doing this directly , since the decimation scheme is based on random couplings ( successively eliminating the strongest coupled spin pair and including their remaining effects as modified couplings calculated perturbatively ) , whereas in the diluted system all couplings are the same",
    ". it may be possible to carry out a decimation procedure by eliminating strongly _ correlated _ spins , instead of strongly _ coupled _ ones .",
    "the correlations could be computed perturbatively based on regions of a small number of spins , or using quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "this way , one could study the renormalization flows of the correlations and how they relate to the sublattice imbalance that we have quantified here in terms of the classical dimer - monomer systems .",
    "the final stages of the decimation procedure should lead to bonds ( entanglement ) between the sites on which our projector qmc calculations give a high triplet probability .",
    "however , we have shown that there are large fluctuations in the long bonds ( singlet as well as triplet ) and it is therefore clear that the scheme can not asymptotically give the correct ground state and low - energy excitation in terms of a single bond configurations . in one dimension",
    ", the final `` random singlet state '' is known to be asymptotically exact,@xcite in the sense that a single bond configuration is a good representation of a superposition including fluctuations around this reference state.@xcite with large fluctuations of long valence bonds among many moments in the percolating clusters , it seems unlikely that a single reference configuration would be a good approximation in this case .",
    "it would still be interesting to investigate the flow of the renormalized coupling distribution .    to go further in developing an understanding of the excitations of the weakly interacting effective moments , instead of working with the full percolating clusters it may be better to explicitly construct the effective low - energy hamiltonian we have discussed here . while the geometrical locations of the moments could be obtained using the classical dimer - monomer model , the effective couplings are more challenging .",
    "one approach would be to just study a bipartite network of spins with some suitable form of the interactions ( which should be non - frustrated , with antiferromagnetic couplings between sublattices and ferromagnetic intra - sublattice couplings ) . in principle",
    "the spins should have mixed @xmath197 . in one dimension",
    "such a system is known to have different properties than the random @xmath0 chain with only antiferromagnetic couplings.@xcite the effective system could be studied with the methods used here , as well as with the strong - disorder decimation scheme . comparing results for the moment network with the dynamic exponents we have extracted here for the full cluster system ( and investigating the robustness of the exponents to variations in the couplings ) could shed further light on this challenging problem .",
