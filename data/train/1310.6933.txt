    "limit theorems for weak convergence of probability measures and stochastic jump processes with frequent jumps of small amplitudes have been widely investigated in the literature , both for univariate and multivariate processes . besides the pure mathematical interest",
    ", the main reason is that these theorems allow to switch from discontinuous to continuous processes , improving their mathematical tractability .",
    "depending on the assumptions on the frequency and size of the jumps , the limit object can be either deterministic , obtained e.g. as solution of systems of ordinary / partial differential equations @xcite , or stochastic @xcite .",
    "limit theorems of the first type are usually called the fluid limit , thermodynamic limit or hydrodynamic limit , and give rise to what is called kurtz approximation @xcite , see e.g. @xcite for a review . in this paper",
    "we consider limit theorems of the second type , which we refer to as diffusion limits , since they yield diffusion processes .",
    "some well known univariate examples are the wiener , the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) and the cox-ingersoll-ross ( also known as square - root ) processes , which can be obtained as diffusion limits of random walk @xcite , stein @xcite and branching processes @xcite , respectively .",
    "a special case of weak convergence of multivariate jump processes is considered in section [ section2 ] , as a guideline for applying the method proposed in @xcite , based on convergence of triplets of characteristics .    in several applications ,",
    "e.g. engineering @xcite , finance @xcite , neuroscience @xcite , physics @xcite and reliability theory @xcite , the stochastic process evolves in presence of a boundary , and it is of paramount interest to detect the so - called first - passage - time ( fpt ) of the process , i.e. the epoch when the process crosses a boundary level for the first time .",
    "a natural question arises : how does the fpt of the jump process relate to the fpt of its limit process ?",
    "the answer is not trivial , since the fpt is not a continuous functional of the process and therefore the continuous mapping theorem can not be applied .",
    "+ there exist different techniques for proving the weak convergence of the fpts of univariate processes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the extension of these results to multivariate processes requests to define the behavior of the single component after its fpt . throughout",
    ", we assume to reset it and then restart its dynamics .",
    "this choice is suggested by application in neuroscience and reliability theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the collection of fpts coming from different components determine a multivariate point process , which we interpret as a univariate marked point process in section 3 .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to show that the marked point process determined by the exit times of a multivariate jump process with reset converges weakly to the marked point process determined by the exit times of its limit process ( cf .",
    "section [ section4 ] and section [ section5 ] for proofs ) .",
    "interestingly this result does not depend on whether the limit process is obtained through a diffusion or a kurtz approximation .",
    "moreover , we also prove that the almost sure convergence of the processes guarantees the almost sure convergence of their passage times .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to provide a simple mathematical model to describe a neural network able to reproduce dependences between spike trains , i.e. collections of a short - lasting events ( spikes ) in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls .",
    "the availability of such a model can be useful in neuroscience as a tool for the study of the neural code .",
    "indeed it is commonly believed that the neural code is encoded in the firing times of the neurons : dependences between spike trains correspond to the transmission of information from a neuron to others @xcite .",
    "natural candidates as neural network models are generalization of univariate leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) models , which describe single neuron dynamics , see e.g. @xcite . these models sacrifice realism , e.g. they disregard the anatomy of the neuron , describing it as a single point , and the biophysical properties related with ion channels , for mathematical tractability @xcite . thought some criticisms have appeared @xcite , they are considered good descriptors of the neuron spiking activity @xcite . + in section [ sectionx ] we interpret our processes and theorems in the framework of neural network modeling , extending the class of lif models from univariate to multivariate .",
    "first , the weak convergence shown in section [ section2 ] gives a neuronal foundation to the use of multivariate ou processes for modeling sub - threshold membrane potential dynamics of neural networks @xcite , where dependences between neurons are determined by common synaptic inputs from the surrounding network .",
    "second , the multivariate process with reset introduced in section [ section3 ] defines the firing mechanism for a neural network . finally , the weak convergence of the univariate marked point process proved in section [ section4 ] guarantees that the neural code is kept under the diffusion limit .",
    "the paper is concluded with a brief discussion and outlook on further developments and applications .",
    "as an example for proving the weak convergence of multivariate jump processes using the method proposed in @xcite , we show the convergence of a multivariate stein to a multivariate ou . mimicking the one - dimensional case",

    "in particular , the processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 are typical of the @xmath4th component , while the processes @xmath22 and @xmath22 act on a set of components @xmath23 . therefore , the dynamics of @xmath24 are determined by two different types of inputs .",

    "indeed , the dependence is commonly introduced in the drift term , motivated by direct interactions between neurons , while the noise components are independent , see e.g. @xcite . here",

    "the objects @xmath312 and @xmath313 are similarly defined for the multivariate ou process @xmath94 , and we call @xmath107 _ multivariate firing ou process_. hence the models @xmath106 and @xmath107 describe the membrane potential dynamics of a network of neurons with reset mechanism after a spike and thus are multivariate lif models .    finally , theorem [ conspike ] implies the convergence of the multivariate firing processes @xmath106 to @xmath107 and the convergence of the collection of marked spike train @xmath314 to @xmath315 .",
    "this guarantees that the neural code encoded in the fpts is not lost in the diffusion limit .      as application of our mathematical findings",
    ", we developed a lif model able to catch dependence features between spike trains in a neural networks characterized by large number of inputs from surrounding sources .",
    "+ to make the model mathematically tractable , we introduced three assumptions : each neuron is identified with a point ; poisson inputs in are independent ; a firing neuron is instantaneously reset to its starting value .",
    "the first assumption characterizes univariate lif models and has been recently assumed for two - compartmental neuronal model @xcite .",
    "we are aware that the hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model and its variants are more biologically realistic than lif .",
    "indeed the hh model is a deterministic , macroscopic model describing the coupled evolution of the neural membrane potential and the averaged gating dynamics of sodium and potassium ion channels through a system of non - linear ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "however , a mathematical relationship between morris - lecar model , i.e. a simplified version of hh model , and lif models has been recently shown @xcite .",
    "this gives a ( further ) biological support to the use of lif models and allows to avoid mathematical difficulties and computationally expensive numerical implementations which are required for hh models .",
    "+ the second assumption grounds on the description of the activity of each synapsis through a point process and it is also common to hh models , for which ion channels are modeled by independent markov jump processes @xcite .",
    "physiological observations suggest that the behavior of each synapsis is weakly correlated with that of the others .",
    "thanks to palm - kintchine theorem , the overall neuron s input is described by two poisson processes , one for the global inhibition and the other for the global excitation @xcite .",
    "+ the third assumption has been introduced to simplify the notation , but it is not restrictive .",
    "remark [ remark4.1 ] guarantees the convergence of the firing process and of the spike times in presence of delayed resets .",
    "thus a refractory period can be introduced after each spike , increasing the biological realism of the model . indeed after a spike",
    ", there is a time interval , called absolute refractory period , during which the spiking neuron can not fire ( while the others can ) , even in presence of strong stimulation @xcite .",
    "having a multivariate lif model for neural networks , several researches will be possible .",
    "first , one can simulate dependent spike trains from neural networks with known dependence structures .",
    "this allows to compare and test the reliability of different existing statistical techniques for the detection of dependence structure between neurons , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , inspired by the techniques for the fpt problem of univariate lif models , one can develop analytical , numerical and statistical methods for the multivariate ou ( or other diffusion processes ) and its fpt problem , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , more biologically realistic lif models for neural networks can be considered .",
    "indeed theorem [ conspike ] can be applied to more general models such as stein processes with direct interactions between neurons , stein with reversal potential @xcite or birth and death processes with reversal potential @xcite .",
    "finally , the application of our results in the neuroscience framework is not limited to the case of lif models .",
    "thanks to remark [ remark2 ] , theorem [ conspike ] can be applied to processes obtained through diffusion and fluid limits , i.e. both lif and hh models .",
    "since the hh model can be obtained as a fluid limit @xcite , once a proper reset and firing mechanism is introduced , the convergence of the fpts follows straightforwardly from our results .",
    "this paper is the natural extension of the researches started and encouraged by professor luigi ricciardi on stochastic leaky integrate - and - fire models for the description of firing activity of single neurons .",
    "this work is dedicated to his memory .",
    "+   + the authors are grateful to priscilla greenwood for useful suggestions .",
    "+   + l.s . was supported by university of torino ( local grant 2012 ) and by project amalfi - advanced methodologies for the analysis and management of the future internet ( universit di torino / compagnia di san paolo ) .",
    "the work is part of the dynamical systems interdisciplinary network , university of copenhagen .",
