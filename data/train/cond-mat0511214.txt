    "theories of superfluidity in solids date to 1969 , with the work of andreev and lifshitz on the long - wavelength , low - frequency behavior of such systems , and to 1970 , with the work of leggett on the non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri).@xcite in equilibrium , the ncri fraction ( ncrif ) is essentially the superfluid fraction ( sff ) , denoted @xmath0.@xcite rotation of the walls of an annulus causes the many - body wavefunction to develop a boundary condition in the rotating frame wherein a non - integral phase change , associated with backflow , accrues when each particle coordinate is transported around the annulus .",
    "an upper bound was developed for the ncrif using a phase - function @xmath6 that included particle correlations only in a dependence on the local particle density @xmath7 : what in the present work we call a one - body phase function .",
    "we assume that the particles making up the solid are bosons .",
    "although solid @xmath1he takes on the hexagonal close - packed structure , ref",
    ".   argued that the results would be similar for a face centered cubic structure , and @xmath0 was then calculated for a density taken to be a sum of gaussians at each lattice site , with lattice constant @xmath8 .",
    "this gave @xmath0 as a function of the localization of the gaussians , taken to vary as @xmath9.@xcite thus @xmath0 was given as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "an equivalent notation uses the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath11 and the rms width @xmath12 of the 1d gaussian @xmath13 , so that @xmath0 can also be thought of as a function of @xmath3 , a lattice - independent quantity that is relevant when later comparison is made with hcp and bcc lattices .",
    "recently , kim and chan have observed non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) , suggested by leggett in 1970 , for solid @xmath1he in vycor , porous gold , and in bulk.@xcite given that the extrapolated values of the @xmath14 ncrif lie in the same 1 - 2% range , despite the different sample porosities , it seems unlikely that it is a surface effect .",
    "recently ncri has also been observed in solid para - hydrogen ( h@xmath15),@xcite an indication that the effect occurs for all bosons that are sufficiently quantum in nature , as measured , for example , by the ( dimensionless ) de boer parameter @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the characteristic length and @xmath18 is the characteristic energy associated with the lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "more recent and better converged calculations based on ref . yielded that , for the expected localization ratio from 1976 , the superfluid fraction would be about 2%,@xcite in reasonable agreement with the observations of kim and chan .",
    "therefore in the present work we have calculated @xmath0 for an hcp solid whose density is a sum of gaussians at the lattice sites , again within the context of a one - body phase function . to characteristic accuracy of three decimal places ( but no more ) , @xmath0 for the hcp solid is isotropic , and to the same degree of accuracy ( but no more ) the curve of @xmath0 _ vs _ @xmath3 has the same form as for the fcc solid . on the other hand , to the same accuracy",
    "the hcp superfluid response is not literally isotropic , and not literally equivalent to the corresponding fcc lattice .",
    "we also obtain@xmath5 for the bcc lattice , whose superfluid density , like that for the fcc lattice , is isotropic .",
    "these results imply that pure crystals of hcp @xmath1he should give , to an accuracy of better than a percent , the same @xmath0 for all flow directions or , equivalently , for azimuthal flow along a fixed experimental cell within which different crystals are grown . on the other hand ,",
    "if the crystal is not perfect , boundary effects may cause the superfluid fraction to change .",
    "this may be the origin of the spread in observed values of the ncrif.@xcite    although the density of real hcp @xmath1he is certainly not a sum of gaussians , we expect the result that @xmath0 is isotropic for the hcp lattice is robust .",
    "it is not obvious why @xmath0 should be as very nearly isotropic as it is , although many properties of electronic systems are very similar for the fcc and hcp systems .",
    "ref . showed that a one - body phase function @xmath20 minimizes the flow energy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , when the equivalent of the continuity equation is satisfied :    @xmath23    for a periodic system we take @xmath24 so @xmath25 where @xmath26 is considered to be a known imposed average superfluid velocity and the @xmath27 s are reciprocal lattice vectors for the hcp lattice . to find the unknown flow pattern ( equivalent to finding the unknown phases @xmath28 ) , we use ( 1 ) to set up a set of linear equations with @xmath26 as the source term . from the phase we can calculate the superfluid velocity and the superfluid fraction .",
    "the fourier transforms satisfy @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the system volume .",
    "explicitly , the convolution theorem gives for the fourier components of @xmath31 that @xmath32    let @xmath33 so @xmath34 .",
    "then the continuity equation implies , for @xmath35 , that @xmath36 when the term in @xmath26 is brought to the other side of the equation , physically this means that , along any @xmath35 , the flow due to the fourier components is opposite the average flow @xmath26 .",
    "this induced flow opposite to @xmath26 also holds for @xmath37 , since typically @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 s that determine the flow pattern can be solved for and then substituted into the equation for the average flow current @xmath40 this completely defines the components of the superfluid density tensor .",
    "we obtain its component along @xmath26 via @xmath41 these equations are valid for any @xmath42",
    ". sometimes we will refer to @xmath43 as the superfluid fraction , although properly we should refer to @xmath44 as the superfluid fraction tensor .",
    "we represent a gaussian in three - space , normalized to unity , by @xmath45}.\\ ] ] in 1d this has rms width @xmath12 . as already noted , refs . and , for fcc lattices plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath46 . in the present work we also consider the hcp lattice and the bcc lattice .",
    "let @xmath47 be the number density in terms of the unit cell volume @xmath48 .",
    "then for the sum - of - gaussians model the fourier transform of the total density is given by @xmath49",
    "for the hcp lattice we take the hcp lattice constant in the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane to be given by @xmath52 , so the nearest neighbor distance @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath54 .",
    "the volume of a unit cell is @xmath55 , as can be determined from @xmath56 , with the basis set vectors given below .",
    "this is the same as for the fcc lattice with the same nearest - neighbor distance @xmath11 , since @xmath57 .",
    "the hcp real - space basis is taken to be ( omitting the subscript on @xmath58 ) @xmath59 the lattice sites are specified by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are integers .    associated with this is an atomic basis set at @xmath62 , where @xmath63 the atoms are located at @xmath64 , where @xmath65 has length @xmath66 .",
    "this choice is not unique ; we could also have employed @xmath67 .",
    "the reciprocal space basis is given by @xmath68 reciprocal lattice vectors ( rlvs ) are specified by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 are integers .      in order to obtain numerical results one must truncate the sum over rlvs . to test for convergence we computed @xmath0 as the rlv basis set was increased .",
    "we employed two methods :    \\(1 ) with @xmath70 all running from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , we computed @xmath0 _ vs _",
    "@xmath73 for each value of @xmath74 , and each of the flow directions considered , which included ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) , ( 0,0,1 ) , ( 1,1,1 ) , and ( 1,@xmath751,0 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and ( 100 ) and ( 001 ) are given in columns two and three of table i. the largest value taken for any @xmath78 value was @xmath79 .",
    "\\(2 ) because the rlv length for the @xmath80 direction is relatively short , to get a better representation of flow along @xmath80 we often included more fourier components in that direction , so that @xmath81 ran from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "this led to improved convergence rates for @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath84 in columns four and five of table i. for this method the largest value taken for any @xmath78 value was @xmath85 .",
    ".superfluid fraction @xmath0 for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and various flow directions . for the hcp lattice ,",
    "columns two and three are by method ( 1 ) and columns four and five by method ( 2 ) , as discussed in the text . for the fcc lattice , columns six and seven are for two different flow directions , where @xmath86 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table4 ]    figure 1 shows the superfluid fraction _ vs _",
    "@xmath3 for the bcc lattice .",
    "it is typically less than that for the fcc and bcc lattices , as expected .",
    "given that kim and chan obtain sff s in the range of 1 - 2% , it would appear that the value of @xmath78 is about 0.12.@xcite however , this value is just in the range where the curve of sff _ vs _ @xmath78 develops a very steep slope . if a microscopic calculation of @xmath78 ( or , better , of @xmath7 ) is accurate to only 10% , then the actual value of @xmath78 could be overestimated , giving a value for @xmath5 perhaps as large as 20% .",
    "if this is the case , the difference between theory and experiment could possibly be attributed to the error in the microscopic calculations of @xmath7 , rather than to an inadequacy of the one - body theory of superflow .",
    "however , current microscopic @xmath7 s are expected to be accurate to a few percent , which should enable a judgement to be made on whether the one - body phase gives an accurate description of the superfluid .",
    "work is in progress to go beyond a one - body phase.@xcite    finally , we note that , although @xmath38 , even at temperature @xmath14 , this does not imply that thermal excitations take up the slack , since we expect that the normal fluid fraction @xmath87 at @xmath14 .",
    "rather , a lattice fraction @xmath88 must be added to andreev and lifshitz s macroscopic theory of superflow.@xcite",
