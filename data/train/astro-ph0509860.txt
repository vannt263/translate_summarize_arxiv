    "it is now realized that most agn have high column densities of absorbing material in our line of sight which significantly change their observable properties across much of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "this material can effectively hide the soft x - ray , optical and uv signatures of an active nucleus .",
    "there are two spectral bands , the hard x - ray ( @xmath9 kev ) and the mid - ir ( 550 @xmath10 m ) , where this obscuring material is relatively optically thin for column densities less than @xmath11 @xmath1 .",
    "thus these bands are optimal for unbiased agn searches @xcite .",
    "recent observations with the spitzer observatory are revealing many agn via their ir emission @xcite , but this process is hampered by strong emission from star formation and the lack of a unique spectral signature to separate agn from normal galaxies .    there has been little progress in hard x - ray surveys in the last 25 years due to a lack of instruments with sufficient angular resolution to identify counterparts in other wavelength bands and with sufficient sky coverage and sensitivity to produce a large sample .",
    "integral observations are predominantly in the galactic plane and high latitude coverage is patchy .",
    "we report here preliminary results from the _ swift _  bat high galactic latitude ( @xmath12 ) survey .",
    "although this report is based on only the first 3 months , we detect 66 sources above @xmath13 significance",
    ". only 9 of the sources do not have firm identifications .",
    "being basically unaffected by obscuration , bat determines the intrinsic 14195 kev luminosity , @xmath7 .",
    "the survey is already about ten times more sensitive than the previous large solid angle survey in this band from heao-1 a4 @xcite and covers the whole sky at @xmath14 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "the bat instrument on _ swift _  is a very large field of view coded aperture hard x - ray telescope with a cdznte detector array ( @xmath151/8 of the sky is at least partially coded at any one time ) . while primarily designed for the detection and rapid dissemination of gamma - ray burst positions , the bat is also an effective all - sky hard x - ray monitor and survey instrument .",
    "the bat focal plane consists of a 0.5 m@xmath16 cdznte array , divided into 32768 detectors , providing good sensitivity and energy resolution in the 14195 kev energy range .",
    "bat can reach @xmath1565 mcrab in a typical 450 s integration and typically covers 5080% of the sky each day .",
    "the effective exposure during the first 3 months varies over the sky from 200 to 800 ks .",
    "away from the galactic center region , the sensitivity scales as the square root of the exposure and so varies by a factor two ( figure [ fig : sens ] ) .",
    "the statistical quality of the bat survey map can be assessed by comparing positive and negative fluctuations .",
    "figure [ fig : resid ] shows the excess in positive fluctuations of individual pixels . with the reconstruction algorithm used , each source appears in several correlated pixels ; the source detection significance is approximately the peak value . since the noise distribution is symmetric , and there are no pixels @xmath17 , we expect no false detections above our @xmath18 threshold .",
    "we estimate that the sensitivity limit is @xmath190.5 mcrab for @xmath1550% of the sky .",
    "the survey is based on individual sky images produced using ffts to correlate the data from one pointing ( typically a few 1000 s ) with the mask pattern .",
    "the fft is oversampled by a factor of 2 to prevent loss of sensitivity at bin boundaries .",
    "each image is a tangent plane projection with a point spread function ( psf ) of 22   full - width at half maximum at the image center .",
    "a single image has very non - uniform sensitivity due to partial coding at the edges ( we exclude regions with @xmath20 partial coding ) .",
    "background variations around the orbit and other systematic effects cause the noise to vary both spatially and temporally . to achieve a good sensitivity",
    "it is necessary to clean from the data the effects of bright sources and of constant background non - uniformities .",
    "the noise in the resulting cleaned images is often near the statistical limit .",
    "however , some excess noise remains , so uncertainties used in this analysis are calculated from the observed r.m.s .",
    "noise in the images .",
    "these images are interpolated and combined to form an all - sky map with 5  sampling .",
    "pixel weights are based on the local r.m.s .",
    "noise in the component images .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "error is then recalculated and the image is searched for local maxima greater than @xmath13 .",
    "each maximum is least squares fitted with a gaussian psf to derive a position and flux .",
    "the output from two separate analysis pipelines ( developed by authors c. m. and j. t. vs. g. s. ) , using somewhat different background correction and image combination algorithms , have been compared and they agree well .",
    "figure [ fig : resid ] shows the bat confidence contours plotted on the images of two known sources , illustrating the variation in position accuracy with source significance .",
    "the systematic and statistical errors are estimated by comparing @xmath151800 bat position measurements with the known positions for @xmath1560 x - ray sources .",
    "the precision improves from @xmath153.7  ( 95% confidence radius ) for sources at @xmath21 significance to @xmath150.9  at @xmath22 significance . for these early data ,",
    "the flux calibration is uncertain by @xmath1530% as a result of the spectrally dependent count rate to flux conversion . at present , the calculation of exposure as a function of sky position is still approximate .",
    "consideration of the @xmath23 distribution and of source spectra are thus left to a later paper .",
    "our list contains 66 sources at @xmath12 , of which 12 can be identified as galactic or smc / lmc objects , and 45 have clear identifications with cataloged optical objects , ( e.g. the catalog of @xcite ) .",
    "except for the coma cluster , all 45 are known agn ( table [ tab : agn ] ) . of the 9 remaining detections , we have tentative identifications for four cataloged objects which do not have bright _ rosat _  counterparts .",
    "two of the unidentified detections are _ rxte _  slew survey sources ( xss j05054@xmath242348 and xss j12389@xmath241614 , which have nearby bright galaxies ) .",
    "three sources do not have obvious optical counterparts .",
    "all but five of the cataloged agn ( eso 297@xmath24018 , ngc 1142 , mcg + 04@xmath2422@xmath24042 , eso 323@xmath24077 and mrk 1498 ) have published or available x - ray spectra .",
    "the identified sources are dominated by low luminosity , low redshift objects .",
    "there are three blazars ( 3c 273 , 4c + 71.07 , and mrk 421 ) and five radio loud agn ( 3c 390.3 , cen a , 3c 120 , 4c + 74.26 and mkn 1498 ) , consistent with the roughly 10% of all agn that are thought to be radio loud .",
    "the line of sight column densities and x - ray fluxes of the 39 objects ( 3 blazars and 36 seyferts ) with x - ray spectra have been obtained primarily by asca or _",
    "bepposax _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in those cases",
    "where lutz et al.do not quote a column density , we have used results from the tartarus asca data base or from archival _ xmm - newton _  or _",
    "chandra _  data . because the tartarus data base uses only simple spectral models , the precision of column densities is only @xmath25 dex .",
    "however this is sufficient to categorize the objects as heavily absorbed or not .    assuming a typical power law spectrum ( @xmath26 ) , a conservative absorption column ( @xmath27 ) , and the bat limiting flux",
    ", we derive a 210 kev limiting flux of @xmath28 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 . using the flux distribution of @xcite",
    ", we expect @xmath29 chance sources per bat error circle , and hence @xmath30 misidentification overall .    excluding the blazars , the median redshift is @xmath31 ( the mean is 0.018 ) , giving a median @xmath32 in the 14195 kev band and a median column density of @xmath33 = 22.6 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity against column density scatter plot for the non - blazars ( figure [ fig : nh_histo ] ) shows an absence of high column density , highly luminous sources .",
    "a surprising result from our survey is the very high fraction of identified sources . in heao-1 @xcite , @xmath151/2 of the 210 kev x - ray",
    "selected agn were ` new ' objects . in the deep _ chandra _  surveys @xcite , @xmath151/3 of all sources did not show a strong optical agn signature .",
    "we thus anticipated that many of the bat hard x - ray selected objects would not have a cataloged agn counterpart .",
    "the high identification rate of this first bat sample shows that , contrary to some suggestions , classical optical techniques have been successful at finding objects with high line of sight column densities in the low redshift universe .",
    "defining an absorbed object as one with @xmath34 @xcite , the ratio of absorbed to unabsorbed objects is 1.8:1 ( excluding the blazars ) , somewhat less than suggested by the standard ` unified ' agn models .",
    "the distribution of column densities is approximately bimodal ( figure [ fig : nh_histo ] ) .",
    "the fact that a ratio of 1:3 was found by @xcite for identified sources in the _ rxte_slew survey indicates the strength of the bias towards the detection of unobscured objects in 210 kev low redshift x - ray surveys .",
    "the distribution of optical classes of the bat sources is very different from those in an optical color selected or line selected survey , with only 20% of the objects being optically classified as seyfert is , compared with @xmath1540% in optical surveys at low redshift .",
    "this illustrates the power of a hard x - ray survey to find all classes of agn .",
    "given the limited sensitivity of the bat survey ( all but 15% of the sources are brighter than @xmath35 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 ) , it is surprising that many are not in the heao-1 a2 catalog @xcite .",
    "most of the 18 objects not seen by heao-1 were clearly missed due to obscuration , since 12 of them have column densities greater than @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "three of these ` missing ' objects ( akn 120 , 3c 390.3 and 4c + 74.26 ) are known to be highly variable .",
    "akn 120 is the only narrow line seyfert  i in the bat sample , which is consistent with the known steep high energy spectrum of these objects @xcite .",
    "comparison of the heao-1 210 kev fluxes with the more recent _ rxte _  fluxes @xcite shows a variation of @xmath1560% in flux , with only @xmath1510% of the objects showing more than a factor of two variability across the @xmath1520 years between these two data sets .",
    "while the _ rxte _  slew survey is much more sensitive than bat for unabsorbed objects , at least 8 bat sources were not detected in the _ rxte _  data ( mrk 348 , mrk 1498 , ngc 3081 , ugc 5037 , ngc 1142 and ngc 1365 ) .",
    "of these , 3 have high column densities , and 3 do not have x - ray spectra .",
    "most ( 36/44 ) of the agn have cataloged _ rosat _  fluxes ( taken from the rospspc catalog when available , otherwise taken from the _ rosat _",
    "all sky survey data base ) .",
    "there is little or no correlation between the bat and _ rosat _  fluxes .",
    "this is not surprising because the scatter in the _ rosat _  rates is dominated by the effect of different degrees of intrinsic absorption in the sources , whereas these have relatively little effect in the bat energy range .",
    "this illustrates the difficulty of constructing a complete agn sample from soft x - ray data .",
    "since there is a very strong relation between optical nuclear and soft x - ray flux @xcite , samples based on optical data are subject to similar difficulties .",
    "a crucial component for models of the x - ray background is the distribution of @xmath38 values .",
    "our data determine this distribution , in an unbiased way , for the first time .",
    "there is little evidence for variation of @xmath38 with @xmath7 below @xmath3943.5 , but above this luminosity @xmath40@xmath8 drops to @xmath41 compared with 22.9 below it .",
    "this break point occurs around the characteristic luminosity of agn in the _ chandra _  surveys of @xmath42 ( corrected for the band pass differences ; @xcite ) and is probably related to this feature .",
    "the only object at @xmath43 with a high line of sight column density is exo 055620@xmath243820.2 .",
    "this object @xcite has complex absorbing material @xcite that seems to be associated with the host galaxy . in the entire bat agn sample ,",
    "including low latitude objects , there are no extra - galactic objects with @xmath44 which are not heavily absorbed .",
    "this is not a selection effect . while such objects clearly exist ( e.g. , ngc 3998 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they must be rare .",
    "the bat data establish the @xmath45 relationship of absorption and luminosity needed to model the evolution of hard x - ray sources e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have constructed physical models which apparently can explain much of the observed evolution of agn and the differences between samples in different wavelength bands .",
    "these models only correctly predict the observed absorption distribution when they include cold material in the line of sight .",
    "the predicted distribution of column densities and the predicted loose correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath38 are in rough agreement with the bat data .",
    "however this model completely misses the observed sharp reduction in high @xmath38 objects at high luminosity .    comparing the bat luminosities with 10 or 3.5 @xmath10 m ir luminosities ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows little or no correlation . a similar lack of correlation of the ratio of the ir to bat flux ratios with x - ray absorption indicates a wide scatter between observed ir properties and the intrinsic properties of the agn .",
    "previous work @xcite had reported a strong correlation between the 10 @xmath10 m ir fluxes and the hard x - ray fluxes , navely expected if the near ir is dominated by agn light which is relatively unabsorbed .",
    "however in the new spitzer results @xcite such a correlation is only seen for type i objects .",
    "this lack of correlation may be due to additional ir radiation from star formation , high optical depths even at 10 @xmath10 m , or additional scatter introduced by reprocessing of the nuclear radiation in the ir .",
    "the absence of a correlation makes the analysis using the unified models to connect the ir and x - ray data suspect @xcite .",
    "similarly there is little or no correlation between bat and [ oiii ] luminosities .",
    "the bat sample allows a true measure of the nature of the low @xmath46 hosts of active galaxies .",
    "of the 24 objects in the sample with `` t '' types as categorized in the rc3 @xcite , 9 have `` t '' types @xmath190 , indicating a spheroidal host fraction of @xmath1540% , similar to that seen in the _",
    "chandra_surveys and the sdss data @xcite .",
    "this is much larger than the fraction in classical optical surveys .",
    "however , none of the objects is classified as a giant elliptical galaxy , which is rather different than the _",
    "chandra _  surveys , probably due to the low redshifts probed by the bat sample .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the broad line radio galaxies detected by heao-1 @xcite ( 3c 111.0 , 3c 120 , 3c 382 , 3c 390.3 ) are detected by the bat , indicating that radio galaxies may have systematically harder x - ray spectra in the bat band than seyferts .",
    "we have shown the usefulness of a sensitive , large solid angle hard x - ray survey in defining the nature of the agn population . as predicted by models of the x - ray background ,",
    "the dominant source population are absorbed agn and are very different from an optically or soft x - ray derived agn population .",
    "we derive the true distribution of absorbing column density with x - ray luminosity and find that while virtually all sources with @xmath4743.5 are absorbed , those with higher luminosities are mostly unabsorbed .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to the break in the x - ray luminosity function and is a strong clue to the nature of the absorbing material and the origin of the feature in the luminosity function .",
    "we find little correlation between other measures of the luminosity of absorbed agn ( e.g. [ oiii ] , 3.5 or 10 @xmath10 m luminosity ) and the hard x - ray luminosity , suggesting that previous techniques may have previously unsuspected biases in finding and measuring absorbed agn .",
    "the high identification fraction ( @xmath1586% ) is somewhat unexpected given our previous knowledge of these sources and bodes well for the much larger samples that the bat will obtain over the next two years",
    ".    further work on the present sample will include determination of the @xmath23 of the hard x - ray sample , the luminosity function , spectral and temporal analysis of the bat selected agn directed towards a detailed understanding of the relationship of the hard x - ray to other wavelength bands .",
    "preliminary estimates indicate that an eventual 3(+ ) year bat high latitude catalog will have more than 200 agn , which will allow extensive correlation analyses .",

    "<S> 12 are galactic type sources and 44 can be identified with previously known agn . </S>",
