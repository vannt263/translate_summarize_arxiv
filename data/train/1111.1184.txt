    "in the standard `` concordance '' ( @xmath0cdm ) model of cosmology , structure formation proceeds in a hierarchical , ` bottom - up ' fashion , with small scale perturbations in the initial distribution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) collapsing first , before merging over time to form larger and larger haloes .",
    "the initial , nearly gaussian , distribution of these overdensities means that large fluctuations , and correspondingly large halo masses , should be extremely rare in the early universe .",
    "however , many of the plausible extensions to the concordance model have been found to be capable of enhancing ( or depleting ) structure formation , including primordial non - gaussianity @xcite , modified gravity @xcite and scalar field @xcite scenarios .",
    "furthermore , each of these extensions can affect structure formation in different ways at different times in the history of the universe , meaning that if we can construct a history of the growth of structure we can discriminate between competing models .",
    "in addition , much attention has recently been paid to the prospect that the existence of a single extreme ( in terms of its high mass _ and _ redshift ) object in the universe has the potential to rule out at a high significance level cosmological models in which it is correspondingly unlikely to exist . following observations of a series of apparently extreme objects @xcite",
    ", some authors have claimed that such objects are either highly unlikely to exist @xcite in a concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology or , more powerfully , are significantly larger than the expected _ most massive _ object in a @xmath0cdm universe @xcite , although @xcite contend this result . as well as highlighting tensions with the standard model , various authors have shown how such high - mass , high - redshift objects may be explained by an enhanced rate of structure formation generated by the inclusion of primordial non - gaussianity @xcite or scalar field dark energy @xcite into the concordance cosmology .    in this paper",
    "we build on our previous work using extreme value statistics @xcite to test the current concordance model with extreme galaxy clusters as well investigating the different behaviours of extreme clusters in alternative models .",
    "we construct the probability contours of the highest mass cluster for all redshifts in an observational survey and directly compare the current best fit @xmath0cdm model with observations showing that , if we consider the full sky ( in order to avoid _ a posteriori _ selection effects ) then none of the currently observed extreme galaxy clusters are in tension with the @xmath0cdm model . then , using information from the codecs @xcite n - body simulations , we show how , if any future observations do exclude the @xmath0cdm model , extreme clusters can potentially be used to understand which of the alternative models available may best explain the enhanced structure formation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : methods ] we introduce extreme value statistics and show how they may be used to predict the mass of the most extreme cluster within an observational survey .",
    "section [ sec : lcdm ] compares predictions for a @xmath0cdm universe with observations .",
    "section [ sec : codecs ] shows how the plot of extreme value contours against redshift can highlight differences between cosmological models . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we conclude and discuss prospects for future work in this area .",
    "extreme value statistics ( evs ) @xcite seeks to make predictions for the properties of the greatest ( or least ) valued random variable drawn from an underlying distribution .",
    "if we consider a sequence of @xmath1 random variates @xmath2 drawn from a cumulative distribution @xmath3 then there will be a largest value of the sequence : @xmath4 if these variables are mutually independent and identically distributed then the probability that all of the deviates are less than or equal to some @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6 and the probability density function ( pdf ) for @xmath7 is then found by differentiating ( [ eqn : evs : evs_cdf ] ) : @xmath8^{n-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the pdf of the original distribution .",
    "this gives the _ exact _ extreme value pdf for @xmath1 observations drawn from a known distribution @xmath3 ; for more discussion of the advantages of this approach over others involving the use of asymptotic theory , see + citeharrison2011 . to apply this general result to the concrete example of the most massive cluster we use the appropriate halo mass function , which gives the number density of haloes @xmath10 , to derive @xmath11 and @xmath3 according to : @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalisation factor @xmath13 is the total ( co - moving ) number density of haloes .",
    "for a constant redshift box of volume @xmath14 the total number of expected haloes @xmath1 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "these distributions can be inserted into equation ( [ eqn : evs : evs_exact ] ) to predict the pdf of the highest mass dark matter halo within the volume .",
    "although this procedure explicitly assumes that haloes are uncorrelated , we have found @xcite that the results closely match those of @xcite , who construct their extreme value distribution as the differential of the void probability : @xmath16 ( allowing them to account for complications due to halo correlations and bias ) , for the high masses of relevance to the inference we are interested in .    in a cosmological survey",
    "we observe clusters at various redshifts along our past light cone rather than on a single spatial hypersurface at fixed @xmath17 . if we wish to construct the evs for galaxy clusters within an observational survey which covers a fraction @xmath18 of the sky between redshifts @xmath19 and @xmath20 we therefore need to take into account both the effect of the growth of structure with decreasing redshift on the halo mass function @xmath21 and the observational volume we are probing in an expanding universe , via the volume element @xmath22 . doing this allows us to form the pdf of halo masses within that survey as : @xmath23 , \\\\",

    "we hence construct the evs distribution for narrow bins in redshift space @xmath26 ( chosen so that @xmath27 and the highest expected mass for all redshifts remains the same as for @xmath28 ) , integrate over these pdfs to find the @xmath29 and @xmath30 confidence regions and plot these , along with the peak of the distribution , for all redshifts @xmath31 .",
    "this can then be used to test the cosmological model : if an observed cluster lies above e.g. the @xmath32 region of such a distribution , then we may say we have a correspondingly significant detection of enhanced structure formation at that redshift .",
    "we can now apply this technique to find out if any currently observed clusters are discordant with the concordance @xmath0cdm predictions .",
    "we emphasize that , because we are predicting the distributions of the _ most massive _ cluster at each redshift , if even a single galaxy cluster lying outside the extreme value contours when placed on a mass - redshift plot can be seen as a significant detection of deviation from concordance cosmology .",

    "we follow the procedures of @xcite and @xcite to convert all cluster masses to @xmath46 , and correct for eddington bias .",
    "eddington bias refers to the fact that there is a larger population of small mass haloes which may up - scatter into our observations than there are high mass haloes which may down - scatter into them , and is corrected for using : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the local slope of the halo mass function and @xmath53 is the measurement uncertainty for the cluster mass .    in order to ensure we are avoiding _ a posteriori _ selection ( by only performing our test in regions in which we have already observed something which we believe to be unusual ) we set @xmath54",

    "[ fig : mmaxz ]    we now seek to use the apparatus described above to test if any currently observed objects are significantly extreme to give us cause to question @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "we consider the set of recently observed , potentially extreme clusters shown in table 1 in a @xmath0cdm cosmology as described above .",
    "the extreme value contours ( light - @xmath30 , medium - @xmath32 , dark - @xmath55 ) , most likely maximum mass @xmath56 ( solid line ) and the cluster masses and redshifts ( stars ) are plotted in figure [ fig : mmaxz ] .",
    "the plot shows the expected features of a peak in maximum halo mass at @xmath57 ( the location and height of which is in broad agreement with the analysis of @xcite ) .",
    "as can be seen , none of the currently observed clusters lie outside the @xmath30 confidence regions of the plot meaning that there is no current strong evidence for a need to modify the @xmath0cdm concordance model from high - mass high - redshift clusters .",
    "this appears to be in agreement with the findings of @xcite for a similar set of clusters , but in contradiction to @xcitecdm ] who find that the cluster xmmuj0044 is a @xmath58 result ( i.e. should lie well above the @xmath30 region in figure [ fig : mmaxz ] ) , whilst here we find it to be well within the acceptable region .",
    "in addition to simply ruling out @xmath0cdm cosmology with massive clusters , we may also consider whether extreme objects offer the potential to discriminate between different alternative models .",
    "whilst many alternative models are capable of predicting enhanced structure formation , the exact scale and time dependence of the enhancement will differ from model to model .",
    "here we consider two models which have a well defined and investigated effect on the halo mass function , and hence are relatively simple to calculate the extreme value statistics over a range of redshift for : local form primordial non - gaussianity and the bouncing , coupled scalar field dark energy model labelled as ` sugra003 ' in @xcite .",
    "these should be regarded as toy models  our aim is to show how the extreme value statistics can be used to select between different models , rather than make definite predictions .      we make use of the codecs simulations kindly made publicly available by @xcite .",
    "this suite of large n - body simulations includes realisations of both @xmath0cdm and a number of coupled dark energy cosmologies . here , we compare the codecs @xmath0cdm - l ( where ` l ' is for ` large ' ) simulation of the concordance cosmology to both the primordial non - gaussianity and the sugra003 ( supergravity ) bouncing dark energy models .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity , motivated by considerations of the fluctuations of the inflaton field , is one of the most widely explored modifications to the concordance cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has long @xcite been known to affect the abundances of high - mass galaxy clusters .",
    "it has also been the model most invoked @xcite to account for apparently over - massive high redshift objects , all of these authors reporting values of local non - gaussianity parameter @xmath59 as being able to account for such clusters .    however , @xcite points out that such models enhance numbers of high mass clusters at all redshifts , creating tension with observations at low redshift in the attempt to alleviate them at high redshift . as an alternative scenario ,",
    "the supergravity - motivated scalar field scenario of @xcite is considered .",
    "this model includes a scalar field component @xmath60 which couples to dark matter with a coupling strength @xmath61 and has the self interacting potential : @xmath62 this scalar field component acts as a ` bouncing ' dark energy ; structure formation is enhanced at early times , but is suppressed with respect to @xmath0cdm after the point at which the evolution of @xmath60 changes sign ( the ` bounce ' ) , meaning @xmath0cdm values for @xmath63 can still be reproduced at @xmath43 . in order to match background observables given by wmap7 constraints @xcite , the sugra003 version of the potential has ` tuned ' parameters @xmath64 .    for @xmath0cdm and sugra models ,",
    "we fit a halo mass function of the @xcite form directly to the haloes identified using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with linking length @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the mean inter - particle separation ) in the relevant codecs simulation ( @xmath0cdm - l and sugra003-l respectively ) . for the primordial non - gaussianity model",

    "we adopt a value of @xmath71 for our non - gaussian model as it is both consistent with the observational findings discussed above and leads to a similar magnitude of enhancement of structure formation at high redshifts as the sugra003 model .",

    "as can be seen ( and as expected ) the primordial non - gaussianity model shows an enhancement of the mass of the highest mass cluster at all redshifts , whilst the sugra model is capable of enhancing @xmath74 at high redshifts whilst leaving it unchanged at more recent times .",
    "thus , if @xmath0cdm is ruled out by both high and low redshift clusters , primordial non - gaussianity could be seen as the favoured explanation whilst , if only high redshift observations appear in contradiction , both non - gaussian and sugra models would be allowed ( unless the limit of an ideal , complete survey was reached ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented a theoretical framework for the interpretation of extremely massive clusters in cosmological surveys .",
    "we avoid ambiguities in the volume being probed by observed clusters which occur in the alternative approach of using single clusters to estimate the halo mass function @xmath75 .",
    "our method , in contrast , does not require such normalisation and is both more _ robust _ and , inevitably , more _ conservative _ , a combination of attributes which we believe should best describe confrontations of theory with observations .",
    "we have used this method to show that existing observations of extreme clusters are not incompatible with the predictions of @xmath0cdm concordance cosmology . however in anticipation of future , more complete surveys , we have also presented a definitive calculation of the region in the mass - redshift plane in which the presence of a single cluster would exclude the standard model with high confidence . we have also shown that different cosmological models including physics beyond the concordance picture are capable of making significantly different predictions of the allowable regions in the mass - redshift plane .",
    "this means that whilst current extreme cluster data do not discriminate between the @xmath0cdm model and these alternatives , future data may well be capable of doing so .",
