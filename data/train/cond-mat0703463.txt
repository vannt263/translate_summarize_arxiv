    "for hole - doped cuprates , it is now generally perceived that the superconducting state has robust @xmath6-wave symmetry.@xcite in the underdoped region , due to the presence of the pseudogap and other possible competing orders,@xcite the measured quasipartcle gap may not reflect the real superconducting gap .",
    "in contrast , in the overdoped region , the normal state properties can be described reasonably well by the fermi liquid picture,@xcite although still with electronic correlation to some extent.@xcite under this circumstance , one may think that the overdoped cuprate provides a clean gateway to the intrinsic high-@xmath11 superconducting state . to accumulate experimentally accessible parameters , such as the superconducting gap , and compare them with the mean field bcs prediction in this very region is thus expected to be particularly valuable .",
    "another puzzling point in the overdoped cuprates is that the superfluid density @xmath12 determined by muon spin relaxation ( @xmath13sr ) technique decreases just as the transition temperature @xmath11 when beyond a critical doping point @xmath14.@xcite this is actually not demanded by the bcs theory .",
    "the decrease of @xmath12 , first reported in tl@xmath15ba@xmath15cuo@xmath16 ( tl2201 ) and subsequently confirmed in other families of cuprates,@xcite was attributed to the unpaired carriers at @xmath17 in overdoped cuprates.@xcite similar conclusion was also drawn from studies of the optical conductivity@xcite and magnetization.@xcite recently , the meissner volume fraction was revealed to decrease as @xmath11 with increasing doping in overdoped la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) and the result was suggested to be consistent with the occurrence of a phase separation into superconducting and normal - state regions.@xcite it is thus highly desired to use the specific heat ( sh ) which is very sensitive to the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level to directly probe these unpaired charge carriers .    in this paper",
    "we shall address these two issues by the low - temperature sh which has established its importance to identify the pairing symmetry in high-@xmath11 cuprates over the past decade.@xcite recently , the quantitative analysis shows that it provides a bulk way to obtain the magnitude of the superconducting gap.@xcite by analyzing the field - induced sh , it is found that the pairing symmetry in the overdoped regime ( up to @xmath18 ) is still @xmath6-wave and the derived gap values @xmath19 approach closely onto the theoretical prediction of the weak - coupling @xmath6-wave bcs superconductivity .",

    "6 we present the fits to @xmath51 for @xmath105 t with this function .",

    ". 6(a ) . as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , this yields the parameter @xmath106 t for all samples @xmath4 .",
    "the rather low @xmath100 is physically unacceptable . at the same time , from the parameter @xmath99 , the coefficient of the residual specific heat @xmath85 can be calculated using the expressions and the @xmath80 described above .",
    "it can be seen , for @xmath107 , the obtained @xmath85 is also inconsistent with the experiment .",
    "secondly , we try to fit the data with @xmath100 fixed within the values shown in the shaded region in fig .",
    "6(e ) ( fit2 ) .",
    "the transport and nernst effect measurements have indicated that @xmath108 ( @xmath100 in tesla and @xmath11 in kelvin ) for the overdoped lsco.@xcite the current sh suggests @xmath109 t for all samples .",
    "hence , in fig .",
    "6(e ) the lower limit of the shaded region is set to be @xmath110 t and the upper limit to be @xmath111 . in this case",
    ", we could not obtain a satisfactory fit to the data , as indicated by the typical result shown in fig .",
    "again , the obtained @xmath85 is contradictory to the measurement ( note , for a given sample , one would obtain the lower @xmath85 with a higher @xmath100 ) ( fig .",
    "therefore , it seems that the impurity scattering effect could not account for the field dependence of the @xmath51 .",
    "the above analysis suggests that in highly doped lsco the @xmath7 mainly comes from contributions other than the impurity scattering .",
    "we attribute it to the presence of nonsuperconducting metallic regions .",
    "this can be corroborated by simultaneously having a good consistency with the volovik s relation @xmath46 and the very large ratio @xmath81 on the single sample @xmath18 .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows the ratio of @xmath81 together with the normalized residual spin knight shift,@xcite @xmath82 , another probe of the residual dos in the superconducting state . in overdoped tl2201",
    "the low - temperature sh has been measured by loram _",
    "et al_. @xcite and the @xmath112 is plotted together .",
    "we can see that all these quantities show a rapid increase with overdoping , indicating a generic property .",
    "actually in lsco previous results also showed the rapid increase of @xmath7 with doping in highly overdoped region although those experiments were done on polycrystalline samples.@xcite one may argue , in lsco , that there is a high - temperature tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition near @xmath113,@xcite which may induce the rapid increase of @xmath7 .",
    "we note that , however , in pr - doped lsco,@xcite this subtle structural transition can be tuned to much higher doping level , but the superconducting dome remains unchanged , indicating that the hole concentration rather than the slight structure distortion plays a dominant role here . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , a very similar residual @xmath7 appears in tl2201 , a system without such a structural transition .",
    "the presence of nonsuperconducting metallic phase implies immediately a decrease of the superconducting volume fraction .",
    "this can just explain the field dependence of the sh in @xmath18 and 0.259 samples . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the observed @xmath47 is even lower than that for @xmath114 , implying a significantly reduced superconducting volume fraction .",
    "taking this into account , the @xmath47 used to derive the @xmath19 for this sample , should be corrected roughly as @xmath115 $ ] , with the assumption that the volume ratio is similar to the dos ratio .",
    "the gap value yielded with this correction is about 3.5 mev , which also scales with @xmath11 in @xmath6-wave bcs manner and is plotted in fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath83 , the sample shows a large @xmath7 being close to the @xmath80 , indicating a rather small superconducting volume fraction .",
    "so far , we have shown that in overdoped lsco , the superconducting gap decreases with increasing @xmath9 and at high doping levels , there exist nonsuperconducting metallic regions at @xmath17 .",
    "let us discuss the implications of both effects .",
    "previously it was suggested that the suppression of @xmath11 in overdoped regime may come from the increasing pair breaking effect .",
    "our present result , however , does not support this proposal since @xmath11 is found to scale with @xmath19 in good agreement with @xmath6-wave bcs theory , which implies that the decrease in @xmath11 should originate from an underlying reduction in the pairing strength .",
    "this point may also be helpful to elucidate the origin of the presence of nonsuperconducting metallic regions in the overdoped sample , which is yet unclear .",
    "currently several scenarios have been proposed to account for this anomalous phenomenon .",
    "one is that the overdoped cuprate may spontaneously phase separate into the hole - poor superconducting region and the hole - rich normal fermi liquid region due to the competition in energy between these two phases.@xcite another scenario is associated with the microscopic hole doping state.@xcite it was speculated that in the overdoped regime the holes were doped directly into the cu3d orbital rather o2p,@xcite which is expected to produce free cu spins and/or disturb the antiferromagnetic correlation between cu spins . around these holes ,",
    "the superconductivity is destroyed , forming the normal state region .",
    "our present result seems supporting this scenario with the assumption that the superconductivity is magnetic in origin and the suppression of @xmath19 originates from the disturbing of the antiferromagnetic correlation with overdoping .",
    "in summary , low - temperature sh in overdoped lsco single crystals has revealed two interesting findings : ( 1 ) the field - induced sh follows the prediction of @xmath6-wave symmetry yielding a gap value @xmath19 approaching closely onto the weak - coupling @xmath6-wave bcs relation @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) at high doping levels , the residual sh term @xmath7 rises dramatically with doping , which suggests the existence of unpaired electrons possible in association with the normal metallic regions . these discoveries may carry out a common feature in cuprate superconductors and give important clues to the high-@xmath11 pairing mechanism .",
