    "multiferroic materials are compounds showing coexistence of two or more ferroic orders , e.g. , ferroelectricity together with some form of magnetic order such as ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism .",
    "presently such materials are attracting enormous attention due to their potential for advanced device applications and because they offer a rich playground from a fundamental physics point of view .",
    "possible applications tend to focus on the magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling , which may pave the way for control of the magnetization by an applied electric field in spintronic devices,@xcite although other applications such as four - state memories @xcite are also of interest .    although intrinsic multiferroic materials are highly desirable , they are generally scarce .",
    "one often - proposed reason may be that partially filled 3@xmath7 shells favor magnetism , while the best - known ferroelectric ( fe ) perovskites have a 3@xmath8 configuration for the transition metal ( e.g. ti@xmath9 , nb@xmath10 , etc.@xcite ) . however , it has recently been shown @xcite that some magnetic perovskite oxides display incipient or actual fe instabilities , clearly indicating that there are ways around the usually - invoked incompatibility between ferroelectricity and magnetism . some of these compounds , namely ,  and , will be considered in this work .    even if several microscopic mechanisms have been identified for the occurrence of ferroelectricity in magnetic materials ,",
    "@xcite alternative routes are needed in order to optimize materials for functional device application .",
    "this could be done either by focusing on new classes of compounds such as hybrid organic - inorganic materials@xcite or by modifying already - known materials to engineer specific properties . in the latter direction ,",
    "an intriguing possibility is to start with non - polar materials and then induce multiple non - polar instabilities ; under appropriate circumstances this can produce a ferroelectric polarization , as first predicted in ref .   based on general group theory arguments and analyzed in the srbi@xmath11nb@xmath11o@xmath12 compound by means of a symmetry analysis combined with density - functional theory calculations by perez - mato _ _ et al.__@xcite here the ferroelectricity",
    "was found to arise from the interplay of several degrees of freedom , not all of them associated with unstable or nearly - unstable modes . in particular , a coupling between polarization and two octahedral - rotation modes was invoked to explain the behavior.@xcite bousquet _",
    "et al . _ have demonstrated that ferroelectricity is produced by local rotational modes in a srtio@xmath13/pbtio@xmath13 superlattice.@xcite although in most improper ferroelectrics a single primary order parameter induces the polarization,@xcite benedek and fennie proposed that the combination of two lattice rotations , neither of which produces ferroelectric properties individually , can induce a me coupling , weak ferromagnetism , and ferroelectricity.@xcite indeed , we now know that rotations of the oxygen octahedra , in combination@xcite and even individually,@xcite can produce ferroelectricity , modify the magnetic order , and favor magnetoelectricity .",
    "another route to creating new multiferroic materials may be to exploit the coupling between polarization , strain , and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "a strong dependence of the lowest - frequency polar phonon frequency on epitaxial strain@xcite is common in paraelectric ( pe ) perovskite oxides , and can sometimes be exploited to drive the system ferroelectric , a phenomenon known as epitaxial - strain  induced ferroelectricity.@xcite in a magnetic system that also has a strong spin - phonon coupling , i.e. , a strong dependence of the polar phonon frequencies on spin order , the magnetic order may be capable of tipping the balance between pe and fe states .",
    "for example , consider a system that has two competing ground states , one of which is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and pe while the other is ferromagnetic ( fm ) and fe , and assume that the spin - phonon coupling is such that the lowest - frequency polar phonon is softer for fm ordering than for afm ordering .",
    "in such a case , the epitaxial - strain enhancement of a polar instability may lead to a lowering of the energy of the fm - fe state below that of the afm - pe phase . spin - phonon mechanisms of this kind have been powerfully exploited for the design of novel multiferroics in refs .  .",
    "clearly , it is desirable to have a large spin - phonon coupling , in terms of a large shift @xmath14 of phonon frequencies upon change of the magnetic order .",
    "interestingly , recently computed spin - phonon couplings in me compounds seems to be strikingly large .",
    "for example , a @xmath14 of about 60 @xmath15 has been reported for the double perovskite la@xmath11nimno@xmath16.@xcite furthermore , @xmath14 values of about 200 @xmath15 have been computed for a cubic phase of srmno@xmath13.@xcite these values appear to be anomalously large when compared to phonon splittings across magnetic phase transitions in other oxides , which are in the 5 - 30 @xmath15 range .",
    "@xcite    in the search for materials with large spin - phonon coupling , first - principles based calculations play a prominent role since they can pinpoint promising candidates simply by inspecting the dependence of the phonon frequencies on the magnetic order .",
    "however , a serious bottleneck appears . to obtain a reliable and accurate description of these effects ,",
    "it is important to describe the structural , electronic and magnetic properties on an equal footing .",
    "this is especially true for transition - metal oxides , which are the usual target materials for the spin - phonon driven ferroelectric - ferromagnet . in this case",
    ", it is well known that the localized nature of the 3@xmath7 electronic states , or loosely speaking , the `` correlated '' nature of these compounds , poses serious limits to the applicability of common density - functional methods like the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "in fact , these standard approximations introduce a spurious coulomb interaction of the electron with its own charge , i.e. , the electrostatic self - interaction is not entirely compensated .",
    "this causes fairly large errors for localized states ( e.g. , mn _ d _ states ) .",
    "it tends to destabilize the orbitals and decreases their binding energy , leading to an overdelocalization of the charge density.@xcite    one common way out is the use of the dft+@xmath3 method , @xcite where a hubbard - like @xmath3 term is introduced into the dft energy functional in order to take correlations partially into account .",
    "the method usually improves the electronic - structure description , but it suffers from shortcomings associated with the @xmath3-dependence of the calculated properties.@xcite unfortunately , there is usually no obvious choice of the @xmath3 value to be adopted ; common choices are usually based either on experimental input or are derived from constrained dft calculations , but neither of these approaches is entirely satisfactory . when dealing with phonon calculations , the @xmath3-dependence becomes even more critical since the phonon frequencies depend strongly on the unit - cell volume used for their evaluation , and the theoretical volume , in turn , depends on @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even if an appropriate choice of @xmath3 can accurately reproduce the binding energy of localized @xmath7 states of transition - metal oxides , it is by no means guaranteed that the same @xmath3 can accurately reproduce other properties of the same compound , such as the volume.@xcite while most papers address the spin - phonon coupling by applying dft+@xmath3 methods , only a few deal with the dependence upon the @xmath3 parameter.@xcite in this paper , we will show that the spin - phonon coupling can strongly depend on the @xmath3 parameter , and that such a dependence may give rise to artificially large couplings .",
    "it is important to stress this message , often overlooked in the literature , in view of the increasing interest in ab - initio predictions of ferroelectric materials driven by spin - phonon coupling .    in the last few years",
    ", another paradigmatic approach has been widely applied in solid - state materials science , namely the use of `` hybrid functionals '' that incorporate a weighted mixture of the exchange defined in the hartree - fock theory ( but using the kohn - sham orbitals ) and the density - functional exchange .",
    "the correlation term is retained from the density - functional framework .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the hybrid functionals outperform semilocal functionals , especially for bulk materials with band gaps.@xcite it has also been shown that for low - dimensional systems such as semiconductor / oxides interfaces , the performance of hybrid functionals remains quite satisfactory .",
    "@xcite however , some doubts have very recently been put forward about the performance of hybrid functionals for certain structural configurations , e.g. , surfaces or nanostructures.@xcite    while there is a plethora of different hybrid functionals , many of them defined empirically , a suitable functional derived on theoretical grounds is the so called pbe0,@xcite where the exchange mixing parameter as been fixed to one quarter as justified by a perturbation - theory calculation .",
    "a closely related functional , the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) hybrid functional,@xcite introduces yet another parameter @xmath17 which splits the coulomb interaction kernel into short- and long - range pieces while retaining the mixing only on the short - range component .",
    "it has been shown that this new hybrid functional ,  @xcite while preserving most of the improved performance of pbe0 with respect to standard local and semi - local exchange correlation functionals , greatly reduces the computational cost .",
    "for this reason , it is especially suitable for periodically extended systems , and is currently being applied in many solid - state applications ranging from simple semiconductor systems to transition metals , lanthanides , actinides , molecules at surfaces , diluted magnetic semiconductors , and carbon nanostructures ( for a recent review see ref .  ) .",
    "the hse functional has been also used for phonon calculations for simple semiconducting systems@xcite or perovskite structures,@xcite where it was shown the that phonon modes are much more accurately reproduced using the hybrid functionals than using gga or lda .",
    "@xcite    very recently , extended benchmarkings of the hse method as well as other self - interaction  corrected approaches have been presented for prototypical transition metal oxides such as mno , nio and lamno@xmath0 , and it has been shown that `` hse shows a remarkable quantitative agreement with experiments on most examined properties''@xcite and `` hse shows predictive power in describing exchange interactions in transition metal oxides.''@xcite these recent studies further motivate us to use the hse functional for our studies of the spin - phonon coupling ; indeed , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ subsec : csb ] , the hse - calculated phonon modes agree well with available experimental results for .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling effect , to the best of our knowledge , is totally unexplored by hybrid functional approaches . in this work we aim at filling this gap .",
    "even when using the more efficient hse functional , however , the use of hybrids entails an increased computational cost which makes the calculation of phonon properties of complex magnetic oxides very difficult . in this paper",
    ", we propose to circumvent this bottleneck by combining the hse and dft+@xmath3 approaches , i.e. , choosing the appropriate @xmath3 for each material by fitting to the hse results for some appropriate materials properties .",
    "this provides a fairly efficient and affordable strategy that preserves the `` hse accuracy '' for lattice constants , spin - phonon couplings , and related properties , while taking advantage of the computationally inexpensive dft+@xmath3 method for the detailed calculations .",
    "further details will be given in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "as far as the materials are concerned , it has been suggested that  perovskites with @xmath4=ca , sr and ba may be good candidates for spin - phonon  coupling driven multiferroicity.@xcite furthermore , it has been reported that both  and  have a large spin - phonon coupling.@xcite we will show below that the spin - phonon coupling can depend strongly on the chosen @xmath3 .",
    "we will also consider the simple perovskite  materials with @xmath6=cr and fe , which have nel temperatures above room temperature  @xcite and large band gaps .",
    "we want to explore the possibility of using these two materials as building blocks for room temperature multiferroics , e.g. , in the form of double perovskites such as .",
    "we have chosen these two classes of materials in part for the reasons outlined above , but also because they are sufficiently `` easy - to - calculate '' for the benchmark and testing purposes of the present work , especially when considering hybrid functionals .",

    "finally , in the appendix , we give details about the methodology used here for a full hse phonon calculation .",
    "all of our calculations were performed in the framework of density - functional theory as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp-5.2 )  @xcite with a plane - wave cutoff of 500ev .",
    "the dft+@xmath3 and hse calculations were carried out using the same set of projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) potentials to describe the electron - ion interaction.@xcite the unit cell for simulating the g - afm magnetic ordering , where all first - neighbor spins are antiferromagnetically aligned , is doubled along the [ 111 ] direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] . the same simulation cell is retained for the fm configuration in order to avoid numerical artefacts that could arise in comparing calculations with different effective k - point samplings .",
    "a @xmath18 @xmath5-centered @xmath19-point mesh is used .",
    "the phonon frequencies were calculated using the frozen - phonon method . except for the case of , the charge density and dynamical matrix retain the primitive 5-atom - cell periodicity for both the g - afm and fm spin structures , so it is appropriate to analyze the phonons using symmetry labels from the primitive @xmath20 perovskite cell .",
    "the zone - center phonons decompose as @xmath21 ( plus acoustic modes ) , with the 4  modes being polar .",
    "the zone - boundary modes at the r point ( which appear at the @xmath5 point in our 10-atom - cell calculations ) decompose as @xmath22 , where the three - fold degenerate r@xmath23 is of special interest because it corresponds to rigid rotations and tilts of the oxygen octahedra . after each frozen - phonon calculation of the zone - center phonons of our 10-atom cell",
    ", we analyze the modes to assign them according to these @xmath19-point and symmetry labels . for , some of the modes mix ( e.g. , 4  with r@xmath24 ) ; in these cases we report the dominant mode character .    as for the polar 4  phonons ,",
    "these are often characterized in @xmath25o@xmath0 perovskites in terms of three kinds of idealized modes as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : modes]a - c . the slater mode ( s-4 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : modes](a ) describes the vibration of @xmath26 cations against the oxygen octahedra ; the last ( l-4 ) mode of fig .",

    "[ fig : modes](c ) represents the distortion of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "@xcite the actual mode eigenvectors never behave precisely like these idealized cases , but we find that they can be identified in practice as being mainly of one character , which is the one we report .",
    "these polar modes contribute to the low - frequency dielectric constant , and their softening in the high - symmetry paraelectric phase indicates the presence of a ferroelectric instability . for the insulating compounds , we further calculated their dielectric constants and born effective charges using density - functional perturbation theory within the dft+@xmath3 context as implemented in vasp .",
    "the antiferrodistortive ( afd ) mode ( @xmath27 mode ) , which describes the rotation oxygen octahedra , is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes](d ) .",
    "we make use of the dft+@xmath3 method  @xcite in the standard dudarev implementation where the on - site coulomb interaction for the localized @xmath28 orbitals is parametrized by @xmath29 ( which we denote henceforth as simply @xmath3 )  @xcite using the pbesol functional,@xcite which has been shown to give a satisfactory description of solid - state equilibrium properties .",
    "we shall refer to this as pbesol+_u_. the lack of experimentally available data for our systems prevents us from extracting @xmath3 directly from experiments ; we will return to this delicate point shortly .",
    "the other functional we have used is hse06,@xcite a screened hybrid functional introduced by heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof ( hse ) , where one quarter of the pbe short - range exchange is replaced by exact exchange , while the full pbe correlation energy is included .",
    "the range - separation parameter @xmath17 is set to @xmath17 = 0.207@xmath30 .",
    "the splitting of the coulomb interaction into short- and long - range pieces , as done in hse , allows for a faster numerical convergence with @xmath19-points when dealing with solid - state systems .",
    "however , as previously mentioned , the application of the hse approach to phonon calculations for magnetic oxide systems remains very challenging in terms of computational workload .      here",
    ", we propose a practical scheme to perform relatively inexpensive dft+@xmath3 simulations that retain an accuracy comparable to hse for the calculation of spin - phonon couplings .",
    "our goal is to obtain a dft+@xmath3 approach that reproduces the dependence of the materials properties on the spin arrangement as obtained from hse calculations . naturally , the first and most basic property we would like to capture correctly is the energy itself .",
    "as it turns out , the energy is also a very sensible property on which one can base a @xmath3-fitting scheme : the energy differences between spin configurations are directly related to the magnetic interactions or exchange constants , and these are known to depend on the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 affecting the electrons of the magnetic species .",
    "( typically , in our compounds of interest , the value of @xmath3 used in the simulations will play an important role in determining the character of the top valence states ; in turn , this will have a direct impact on the nature and magnitude of the exchange couplings between spins . )",
    "this dependence of the exchange constants on @xmath3 makes this criterion a very convenient one for our purposes . of course , such a fitting procedure does not guarantee our dft+@xmath3 scheme will reproduce correctly the phonon frequencies and frequency shifts between different spin arrangements obtained from hse calculations . in that sense",
    ", we are relying on the physical soundness of the hubbard-@xmath3 correction to dft ; as we will see below , the results are quite convincing .",
    "total energy difference @xmath31 with @xmath3 for , @xmath32 is the energy difference with volume fixed to the optimized volume from hse and @xmath33 relaxed volume for each @xmath3 .",
    "( the fitted value of @xmath3 occurs at the crossing with the @xmath34 value . ) ]    obtaining @xmath3 from the energy differences has an additional advantage : it allows us to devise a very simple fitting procedure that relies on a minimal number of hse calculations .",
    "in essence , these are the steps we follow .",
    "we relax the cubic structure separately for g - afm and fm spin configurations using hse and obtain the total - energy difference @xmath35(hse ) = @xmath36 ( hse ) - @xmath37(hse ) .",
    "we then carry out a series of pbesol+_u _ calculations in which @xmath3 is varied from 0 to 6ev and obtain @xmath38 = @xmath39 for each @xmath3",
    ". the @xmath3 is then chose such that @xmath38= @xmath35(hse ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitu ] shows the results of our fitting for  by using two slightly different approaches . in one case we ran the pbesol+_u _ simulations at the hse - optimized volumes , and in the other case we performed volume relaxations at the pbesol+_u _",
    "level for each @xmath3 value considered .",
    "it can be seen that such a choice does not have a big effect on the computed frequency shifts , and both result in the same @xmath3 value .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 values reported here were obtained by running pbesol+_u _ simulations at the hse volumes.@xcite we obtained @xmath3= 3.0 , 2.8 , 2.7 , 3.8 , and 5.1ev , respectively , for , , ,  and .@xcite we then do detailed phonon calculations using this value of @xmath3 in the pbesol+_u _ calculations to investigate spin - phonon coupling effects in  and .    as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we have tested this proposed scheme and found that it works quite well .",
    "in particular , the phonon frequency shifts @xmath40 computed using pbesol+_u _ with the fitted @xmath3 are almost the same as those obtained using hse directly .",
    "since a previous study has concluded that hse works `` remarkably well '' for transition - metal oxides,@xcite we believe this approach can be used with confidence .",
    "finally , we note that the direct hse calculations can be rather heavy , even though we only have 10-atom cells ; the presence of magnetic order and the need to calculate the phonons and the spin - phonon couplings makes the calculations challenging .",
    "@xcite we circumvent this difficulty by splitting a single run of hse frozen - phonon calculations into several parallel runs , each one computing the forces for symmetry - independent atomic displacements .",
    "we then use the forces calculated in these runs to construct the force - constant matrix , and by diagonalizing this matrix , we obtain the phonon frequencies and eigenvectors .",
    "further details of this procedure are presented in the appendix .",
    "let us begin by showing some representative results of the @xmath3-dependence of the phonon frequencies and frequency shifts for the  and  compounds .",

    "figure  [ fig : diffu ] shows our results for the key modes that determine the occurrence of ferroelectricity , i.e. , the 4  polar phonons and the 5  antiferrodistortive ( afd ) mode .",
    "the 5  mode involves antiphase rotations of the o@xmath2 octahedra around the three principal axes of the perovskite lattice ; such a mode is soft in many cubic perovskites , and it often competes with the fe instabilities to determine the nature of the low - symmetry phases .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : diffu]a we see that the 4  and 5  modes depend strongly on the chosen @xmath3 .",
    "notably , the frequency shift @xmath43 of the s-4  mode can change from 400  1  to 0  1  as @xmath3 increases from 0 to 8ev .",
    "the @xmath14 of the a-4  and 5  modes also depend on the @xmath3 , while the l-4  mode is nearly insensitive to @xmath3 within this range of values .",
    "interestingly , the large frequency shift of s-4  is related to the strong @xmath3-dependence of the fm s-4  mode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffu]b .",
    "hence , our results show that the magnitude of the spin - phonon coupling has a significant dependence on the value of @xmath3 employed in a dft+@xmath3 calculation , and that such a dependence is particularly strong for some of the key modes determining the structural ( fe / afd ) instabilities of cubic perovskite oxides .",

    "we also found the fm energy to cross below the afm one for @xmath57ev .",
    "in our case it takes about 6 days to obtain the phonon frequency for g - afm  using a direct hse calculation with 96 cores ( amd opteron 6136 2.4ghz with infiniband network ) , but less then 0.5 hours using pbesol+u with only 16 cores .                  because the symmetry is lower than for a @xmath58 perovskite , some modes of the double perovskite  listed in table  [ tab : lcfo - phonon ] are combinations of two modes .",
    "we list the dominanant contribution in the table .",
    "for example , the mode with frequency 3831  in the afm structure is 86.5% r@xmath24 and 13.5% @xmath42 , so we denote it as r@xmath24 ."
