    "in type iib string theory there exists an @xmath2 multiplet of strings labeled by their nsns and rr charges @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these strings are allowed to connect at a point or a `` junction '' as long as charge is conserved at the junction @xcite . of particular interest are bps saturated junctions @xcite , which preserve a fraction ( 1/4 ) of the supersymmetry , and are therefore guaranteed to be stable .",
    "recent interest in string webs has focused on their application to quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "one of the successes of string web technology was the first explicit construction of @xmath4 bps states in @xmath5 @xmath6 super - yang - mills ( sym ) theory @xcite .",
    "in this example the dilaton and axion of type iib string theory are constant , and it is relatively straightforward to analyze the bps properties of string webs",
    ". a richer set of examples involve a dilaton and axion which are position dependent due to the presence of 7-branes in the background .",
    "however , the bps nature of string webs has only been analyzed in the 7-brane background corresponding to pure @xmath0 @xmath1 sym so far @xcite .",
    "these examples display a number of interesting phenomena including `` marginal stability '' , whereby space ( moduli space in the world - volume field theory ) may contain regions in which string webs fail to be bps . in this paper",
    "we study another interesting phenomenon , in which the stringy description of a bps state may undergo a transition , as one moves in moduli space , from either a single open string or a string web , to another string web .    in a recent paper we showed how to represent bps states in @xmath0 @xmath1 sym theory using string webs @xcite .",
    "the field theory is constructed as the world volume theory of a d3-brane in a 7-brane background .",
    "bps states correspond to string webs with one ( or two in the case of vector multiplets ) string ending on the d3-brane and the others on the 7-branes . here",
    "we show how in different regions of moduli space the string configuration representing a bps state changes from a string web to either a different string web or to a single string .",
    "these transitions are driven by the string creation phenomenon @xcite , which we generalize here to multiple string creation between @xmath3 7-branes and @xmath7 strings .",
    "this also allows us to generalize to some extent the `` s - rule '' @xcite , which limits the number of strings that can link a 7-brane and another string .",
    "transitions of the type addressed here were first discussed in @xcite for the case where all strings end on 7-branes .",
    "a closely related paper @xcite argues that for any given configuration of 7-branes a bps state has a unique stringy representative .",
    "the results presented here , aside from their application to @xmath0 theories , are of independent interest in string theory .",
    "in fact , the 3-brane plays little role in what follows except to give strings a place to end .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review and generalize the string creation effect and the s - rule . in section  3",
    "we express the supersymmetry conditions on strings and string webs in terms of @xmath3-geodesics and geodesic webs , and relate the latter to constant phase curves of analytic functions . in section  4 we show that the complex plane ( moduli space ) is divided into four regions , and exhibit the transitions that occur as one moves from one region to another .",
    "we include an appendix , in which we give relevant information about the analytic functions in question , including a few numerically obtained constant phase curves .",
    "when a d@xmath8-brane crosses a mutually transverse d@xmath9-brane a fundamental string , whose ends terminate on the two d - branes , is created .",
    "this phenomenon was originally discovered in @xcite , and is related by a chain of dualities to the creation of d3-branes between crossing 5-branes @xcite .",
    "it has since been exhibited in a number of different ways @xcite . for @xmath10",
    "the effect involves a d1-brane , _ i.e. _ @xmath11 string , and a d7-brane , _ i.e. _ @xmath12 7-brane 7-branes are objects on which @xmath3 strings can end .",
    "] , in type iib string theory .",
    "when the branes cross each other , a @xmath12 string is created between them . by @xmath13 invariance",
    "one can generalize this result to the creation of a single @xmath3 string between a @xmath3 7-brane and an @xmath7 string , where @xmath14 .    if @xmath15 the configuration can not be related by duality to any of the above , and the arguments in @xcite are not applicable . nevertheless , it is straightforward to generalize the string creation phenomenon to an arbitrary @xmath3 7-brane and an arbitrary ( transverse ) @xmath7 string .",
    "we associate a branch cut to the @xmath3 7-brane in the transverse plane , which one can think of as the place where the following monodromy occurs : m_(p , q ) = (    cc 1-pq & p^2 + -q^2 & 1+pq    ) .",
    "[ monodromy ] when an @xmath7 string living in the transverse plane crosses this cut in a counter - clockwise manner it undergoes a monodromy transformation , (    c r + s    ) m_(p , q ) (    c r + s    ) = (    c r + s    ) + ( ps - qr ) (    c p + q    ) . the asymptotic charges of the string are therefore @xmath7 at one end , and @xmath16 at the other ( fig .",
    "these can not change as we pull the string through the 7-brane .",
    "however , since now the string does not cross the cut , something else must supply the additional charge .",
    "we conclude then that @xmath17 @xmath3 strings are created between the string and the 7-brane , oriented in such a way as to conserve the charges ( fig .",
    "= 4 in    in the special case of @xmath14 we obtain the known result of single string creation . for @xmath15",
    "one can use @xmath13 to relate the system to a @xmath12 7-brane and an @xmath18 string .",
    "one can then think of the @xmath18 string as a bound state of @xmath19 d - strings with @xmath20 units of electric flux .",
    "each of the d - strings will create a @xmath12 string when it crosses the 7-brane , giving a total of @xmath21 strings .",
    "the orientation of the created strings is determined by charge conservation , but is also restricted by supersymmetry .",
    "consider the case of d - branes .",
    "the initial configuration , consisting of a d7-brane and a transverse d - string , is supersymmetric , and therefore the final configuration must also be supersymmetric . on the other hand",
    "it can be shown @xcite that such a configuration will only be supersymmetric if the fundamental string is oriented in the right way .",
    "it is a matter of convention which of the two orientations preserves supersymmetry .",
    "the important point is that only one of them does .",
    "charge conservation in the string creation process fixes this convention , and gives us the unique supersymmetric orientation .",
    "this leads to a non - trivial selection rule , known as the `` s - rule '' @xcite , for configurations of 7-branes and transverse strings , and configurations related to them by dualities . consider a configuration of @xmath22 fundamental strings between a d7-brane and a transverse d - string ( fig .",
    "supersymmetry restricts the orientation of the fundamental strings .",
    "as the d - string crosses the d7-brane two things happen : the @xmath22 fundamental strings reverse orientation , and a single fundamental string oriented supersymmetrically is created .",
    "the latter will annihilate with one of the former , leaving @xmath23 strings which are oriented so as to break supersymmetry ( fig .",
    "the final configuration is therefore _ not _ supersymmetric , and therefore neither is the initial configuration , even though it seemed to be .",
    "we conclude that supersymmetry restricts not only the orientation of strings between the branes , but also their number . in the above case",
    "there can be at most _ one _ fundamental string between a d7-brane and a d - string .",
    "more generally , the maximum number of @xmath3 strings between a @xmath3 7-brane and an @xmath7 string allowed by supersymmetry is @xmath17 .",
    "= 4 in    in the case of @xmath14 there are other ways of deriving this rule @xcite . in particular , in the dual configuration of a d0-brane and a d8-brane the `` s - rule '' can be understood as a pauli exclusion principle , since the ground state of a 0 - 8 string corresponds to a single fermion in the d0-brane world - volume .",
    "alternatively , in the d2@xmath24d6 configuration one can derive the `` s - rule '' by lifting to m - theory , and finding all the holomorphic curves corresponding to a supersymmetric embedding of the m2-brane in a kaluza - klein monopole background .    as an application of this selection rule",
    "let us consider a configuration of a @xmath12 7-brane , a @xmath25 7-brane , and a @xmath11 7-brane , connected by a `` 3-string junction '' consisting of two @xmath12 strings , a @xmath25 string , and a @xmath11 string ( fig .  3b ) . since the @xmath25 and @xmath11 7-branes can be thought of as the quantum resolution of an orientifold 7-plane @xcite , this configuration corresponds to the quantum resolution of a string which begins on the d7-brane , reflects off the orientifold plane , and ends on the d7-brane ( fig .",
    "( in the covering space this becomes a string between the d7-brane and its image ) . in this _ classical _ description , the usual massless ( vector ) ground state of the string",
    "is removed by the orientifold projection , leaving a massive _ non - bps _ ground state .",
    "this state is extremal in the sense that it is the lowest mass charged state .    in the quantum picture",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "the configuration in ( fig .",
    "3b ) violates the `` s - rule '' , since it contains _ two _ @xmath12 strings between the d7-brane and the @xmath11 string .",
    "it therefore breaks supersymmetry , and the corresponding state is non - bps .",
    "one can compare this to the situation in which the d7-brane is replaced by a d3-brane .",
    "in this case the massless vector survives the orientifold projection , and leads to an enhanced gauge symmetry @xmath26 when the d3-brane coincides with the orientifold 7-plane . in the quantum picture the `` 3-string junction '' with the d3-brane",
    "satisfies the s - rule , and is therefore supersymmetric .",
    "a @xmath3-geodesic between points @xmath27 and @xmath28 is defined as the path which minimizes the mass of a @xmath3 string stretched between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "since the geodesic is independent of the overall sign of @xmath3 we shall assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath31 .",
    "in a generic 7-brane background @xmath32 is position - dependent , and in fact undergoes monodromies as branch cuts are crossed .",
    "the metric on the transverse ( complex ) plane is given by @xcite ds^2 = |f(z)dz|^2 , and is smooth everywhere .",
    "the function @xmath33 is determined by the 7-brane background .",
    "one can define a flat `` @xmath3-metric '' ds_(p , q ) = t_(p , q)ds =    @xmath34 given by dw_(p , q ) = ( p+q)f(z)dz , [ pqcoord ] in which @xmath3-geodesics are straight lines , w_(p , q)(t ) = ct + d . a necessary condition for @xmath3 strings to preserve supersymmetry is that they lie along @xmath3 geodesics @xcite .",
    "if in addition the 7-brane background is supersymmetric , this is a sufficient condition .",
    "multi - pronged strings , and more generally string webs ( which can include several junctions and internal strings ) , arise quite naturally in type iib string theory .",
    "the simplest example corresponds to the configuration of a fundamental string ending on a d - string . by charge conservation , this turns the d - string into a @xmath35 string , and one ends up with a @xmath36 three - pronged string . due to the @xmath13 symmetry of type iib string theory there is actually an entire @xmath13 multiplet of such objects , each of which satisfies the charge conservation condition @xmath37 .",
    "by gluing several of these objects together one can form a rich variety of string webs .",
    "a necessary condition for a string web to preserve supersymmetry is that it lies on a _",

    "] this reduces to the usual angle conditions in flat space @xcite .",
    "this is not a sufficient condition however , as the string web may violate the `` s - rule '' ( or a generalization of it given in @xcite ) , as in the example of the previous section .",

    "the metric on the complex plane is given by ds^2 = 2| ^2()(z-1)^-1/12(z+1)^-1/12dz|^2 , where we have set @xmath42 as compared to @xcite .",
    "we shall choose the branch cuts associated to the @xmath11 and @xmath25 7-branes to run along the real axis from @xmath40 to @xmath43 , and from @xmath41 to @xmath43 , respectively .",
