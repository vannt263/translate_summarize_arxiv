    "the existence of magnetars  young , isolated , high - magnetic - field neutron stars  is now well supported by a variety of independent lines of evidence . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "there appear to be at least two flavors of magnetar : soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "defining properties of both are their x - ray pulsations having luminosity in the range @xmath6  erg  s@xmath4 , periods ranging from 6  12  s , period derivatives of @xmath7 , and surface dipolar magnetic fields in the range @xmath8  g , assuming the vacuum dipole model formula for magnetic braking  g , where @xmath9 is the spin period and @xmath10 the period derivative ] . in the magnetar model ,",
    "the pulsed x - rays are likely the combined result of surface thermal emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a non - thermal high - energy tail resulting from resonant scattering of thermal photons off magnetospheric currents @xcite .",
    "the x - rays , in the magnetar model , are ultimately powered by an internally decaying very strong magnetic field . despite numerous attempts , no magnetars",
    "have been detected at radio frequencies @xcite , which has been suggested as implying that pair production ceases above some critical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "an open issue in the magnetar model is the connection of these x - ray sources to radio pulsars .",
    "one might expect high-@xmath11 radio pulsars to be more x - ray bright than low-@xmath11 sources , and possibly exhibit magnetar - like x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite searched for enhanced x - ray emission from the high-@xmath11 ( @xmath12  g ) radio pulsar psr  j1814@xmath01744 , and placed an upper limit on its x - ray luminosity that was much lower than those of the five then - known axps ( 4u 0142 + 61 , 1e 1048@xmath09537 , rxs 1708@xmath04009 , 1e 1841@xmath0045 , 1e 2259 + 586 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the nearby radio pulsar psr  b0154 + 61 ( @xmath13  g ) has an x - ray luminosity 23 orders of magnitude lower than those of the same five axps .",
    "@xcite reported on x - ray observations of psr  j1847@xmath00130 ( @xmath14  g ) , which has the highest inferred surface dipolar magnetic field of any known radio pulsar , and calculated an upper limit on its x - ray luminosity that was lower than those of all but one of the above five axps .",
    "@xcite studied psr  j1119@xmath06127 ( @xmath15  g ) , also finding it to be x - ray underluminous relative to the standard axp group .",
    "there are several possible ways to explain these results",
    ". there could exist a well - defined critical @xmath11 field above which the magnetar mechanism abruptly turns on .",
    "however , that would also require that @xmath11 fields inferred from spin - down are unreliable at the factor of @xmath162 level , given the overlap in high-@xmath11 radio pulsar fields and those of the axps ( e.g. 1e  2259 + 586 has @xmath17  g ) .",
    "it could also be that axps and sgrs have higher - order multipole moments that go undetected in spin - down , such that their true surface fields are orders of magnitude higher . the recently revealed strong x - ray variability seen in some axps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that magnetar emission could be transient in many high-@xmath11 neutron stars .",
    "of course , which neutron stars become magnetars could depend on other , currently `` hidden '' neutron - star properties besides @xmath11 field , such as mass .",
    "psr  j1718@xmath03718  is a radio pulsar that was recently discovered in the parkes multibeam survey @xcite .",
    "it has spin period @xmath18  s and a spin - down rate of @xmath19 , which imply a characteristic age @xmath20  kyr , spin - down luminosity @xmath21  erg  s@xmath4 , and a surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath22  g. its inferred magnetic field is the second highest of all known radio pulsars and is higher than that of the well established axp 1e  2259 + 586 . here",
    "we report on the first x - ray detection of this pulsar in a deep _ chandra x - ray observatory _ observation of a nearby field .",
    "the position of psr  j1718@xmath03718  was observed serendipitously by _",
    "chandra _ in an acis - s timed exposure ( te ) obtained on 2002 may 13 .",
    "the observation ( pi p. slane , sequence number 500235 ) had as its target the unrelated supernova remnant g347.7 + 0.2 .",
    "the nominal telescope pointing was @xmath23 away from the pulsar s position derived from radio timing .",
    "as a result , the position of psr  j1718@xmath03718  lies on chip 6 , far from the optical axis , where the mirror point - spread - function ( psf ) is significantly extended and distorted asymmetrically .",
    "we obtained the public data set using the _ chandra _ science center s _ webchaser _ facility , and reduced the data with the ciao software package ( version 3.1 ) , with calibration database caldb version 2.28 .",
    "after standard filtering using ciao threads for acis - s data , the effective integration time was 55.7  ks .",
    "the x - ray emission as seen by _",
    "chandra _ around the radio position of psr  j1718@xmath03718  is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the source is identified with ciao s celldetect routine as having a signal - to - noise ratio of 6.4 , for events in the energy range 0.53.0  kev .",
    "no source is apparent in images made with events having energies @xmath24  kev .",
    "although the source appears extended ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) , given its large off - axis angle , its extent both in size and morphology , including the angle of asymmetry , is consistent with the instrumental psf at 1.5  kev , as determined using the ciao mkpsf routine .",
    "indeed , using counts in the range 0.53.0  kev , celldetect run with default parameters reports a ratio of source to psf size of 1.01 .",
    "given that the approximate 95% encircled energy radius for an object @xmath23 off axis is @xmath25 , we can not rule out the presence of faint emission having extent significantly smaller than this .",
    "however , as argued below , the spectrum strongly favors the emission originating from a point source .",
    "the celldetect routine reports a best - fit position for the x - ray source of ( j2000 ) ra = 17@xmath2618@xmath279@xmath28.84@xmath290.02 , dec = @xmath3018@xmath3151@xmath32.6@xmath290.2 .",
    "these ( 1@xmath33 ) uncertainties are statistical , and do not include the systematic uncertainty in _ chandra _",
    "s pointing .",
    "note that for sources that are within @xmath34 of the aimpoint , the 90% uncertainty circle of _ chandra _ s absolute pointing has radius 0.6@xmath32 . for sources , like ours , that are further off - axis",
    ", the absolute pointing uncertainty has not been well determined .",
    "this is an important caveat .    a timing analysis of the radio data ( see * ?",
    "* for a description of the data and its analysis ) yields a radio timing position of ( j2000 ) ra = 17@xmath2618@xmath2710@xmath28.162@xmath290.194 , dec = @xmath3018@xmath3153@xmath32.75@xmath2910.0 , where the quoted errors are formal @xmath35 uncertainties as reported by tempo , and 10 months of additional timing data have been included since the most recently published result .",
    "doubling the formal tempo uncertainties when reporting timing parameter errors is standard practice and is done to account for likely contamination from timing noise .",
    "indeed , like most young pulsars , psr  j1718@xmath03718  exhibits significant timing noise ( rms 74  ms after fitting for position , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , so the above - quoted uncertainties are likely to be good approximations to the true @xmath36 uncertainties .",
    "the formal positional offset in declination is therefore @xmath37 , or @xmath38 , while the ra offset is 0@xmath39.32 , or @xmath40 .",
    "note that these numbers do _ not _ include the unknown _ chandra _ pointing uncertainty so are lower limits only .",
    "we conclude that the source positions are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "however , given the slight possible positional offset , as well as the absence of unambiguous proof of the association via the detection of x - ray pulsations at the radio period ( not possible with the acis - s data because it has effective time resolution of 3.2  s ) , it is reasonable to question if the x - ray source is really associated with the radio pulsar .",
    "we can estimate the probability of chance superposition using a log  n / log  s relationship for _ chandra _ sources in the 0.52.0  kev band , appropriate for this source @xcite . in this relation ,",
    "flux is the unabsorbed value ; thus the probability of an x - ray source being near the pulsar position purely by chance depends strongly on the former s spectral parameters .",
    "as we show below , given only 110 source counts , these parameters are not well determined .",
    "however , even for the lowest plausible unabsorbed source flux for our source , the log  n / log  s relation predicts @xmath41180 sources per square degree . with timing noise so strong in this pulsar , we would likely consider positional agreement within @xmath4110@xmath32 to be a plausible association .",
    "in this case , the probability of a random source in this area of sky is only 1% . that the offset is smaller than 10@xmath32 , as well as that the unabsorbed flux is likely significantly larger than the lowest reasonable value ( see below ) make this 1% probability likely to be a large overestimate .",
    "thus , the association appears extremely likely .",
    "we further note that the nearest optical counterpart in the uncalibrated plates of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath41 22 , is more than 20@xmath32 away , well outside of our _ chandra _ error radius .",
    "counts from the pulsar were extracted using an elliptical extraction region having semi - major and semi - minor axes of 26 and 18 pixels ( 13@xmath32 and 9@xmath32 ) , respectively , rotated to angle 308@xmath42 west of north .",
    "a nearby , non - overlapping source - free region having the same elliptical shape and orientation , but with semi - major and semi - minor axes 40 and 32 pixels ( 20@xmath32 and 16@xmath32 ) , respectively , was used to estimate the background .",
    "the total number of source counts after background subtraction was 110 , implying a count rate of 0.00197@xmath290.00019  cps .",
    "rmf and arf files were generated for the source and background using the ciao script psextract , and spectra grouped by a factor of 8 were fed into the spectral fitting package _ xspec _",
    "( version 11.3.1 ) .",
    "spectral channels having energies below 0.5  kev and above 3.0  kev were ignored .",
    "the data were well described by an absorbed black - body model ; best - fit model parameters are given in table  [ ta : spectrum ] , and the spectrum and best - fit model with residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "although a power - law model yielded a statistically acceptable fit , the best - fit power - law index was @xmath4189 , rendering such a model implausible .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of counts above @xmath412  kev .",
    "fitting for multi - component models was unreasonable due to the small number of counts available .",
    "however , it is clear that it is clear that the emission is dominantly thermal in origin .",
    "this argues strongly against our having detected any nebular component , as this should have a harder spectrum that is well characterized by a power - law model with photon index in the range @xmath4113 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the absorbed flux of the source in the 0.52.0  kev range is ( 6.36.9)@xmath43  erg  s@xmath4 , where the range quoted corresponds to that implied by the 68% limits of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the quoted flux range is an approximate but slightly overestimated 68% confidence range . with only 110 source counts , xspec is unable to more precisely constrain the true 68% confidence range for the flux while simultaneously fitting for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the low end of the flux range corresponds to higher values of @xmath44 and lower values of @xmath45 ; the high end corresponds to the reverse .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.52.0  kev flux is therefore relatively poorly constrained , ranging from @xmath46  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath5 for the high @xmath45 end , to @xmath47  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath5 for the low @xmath45 end .",
    "we note that the maximum @xmath44 in this direction is @xmath48  @xmath5 , significantly lower than our upper 68% confidence limit @xcite .",
    "this suggests that models having lower values of @xmath44 , and hence higher values of @xmath45 and low values of unabsorbed flux , are slightly favored .",
    "the dispersion measure toward the pulsar of 373  pc  @xmath49 implies a distance of 4.0  5.0  kpc @xcite . we assume here a distance of 4.5  kpc .",
    "dispersion - measure distances are notoriously uncertain and an independent distance estimate is obviously desirable . we do note that the @xcite distance estimate for psr  j1718@xmath03718  is 5.1  kpc , close to that obtained with the more recent @xcite model , suggesting our assumption of 4.5  kpc is not grossly incorrect .",
    "given the spectrum of the detected x - rays , the emission seems most likely to be coming from the neutron - star surface .",
    "thermal emission from the surface can either be from initial cooling , in which case x - rays are emitted from the entire surface , or from heated polar caps , a by - product of a higher - energy magnetospheric process ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . in the former case ,",
    "the x - ray energy source is unrelated to the pulsar s spin - down . in the latter case , the spin - down powers it .    given the observed spectrum and flux of the x - ray source we detect , we may ask which of these two mechanisms most likely accounts for the emission .",
    "first , we consider the high - temperature range of parameter space , @xmath50  kev . in this case",
    ", the unabsorbed flux , given the distance , requires a source emitting radius of @xmath411  km .",
    "this suggests heated polar caps , in which case the emission could be strongly pulsed .",
    "the implied bolometric isotropic luminosity would be @xmath51  erg  s@xmath4 , or 0.16@xmath52 .",
    "this is uncomfortably high for polar - cap reheating models @xcite .",
    "assuming 1.0  sr beaming , the efficiency drops to 0.013 , still implausibly high for a pulsar having characteristic age 34  kyr @xcite . at the low - temperature range of parameter space",
    ", we have @xmath53  kev . in this case , for the observed unabsorbed flux at 4.5  kpc , an effective emitting radius of 22  km is required , too high for a neutron star , even after correcting for the gravitational distortion @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems likely on physical grounds that even though table  1 quotes 68% confidence levels only , the true spectral parameters are indeed bracketed in this range .",
    "for example , for @xmath54  kev ( corresponding to @xmath55  @xmath5 ) , the observations can be accounted for if the effective measured neutron - star radius is @xmath4113  km . in this case",
    ", the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity would be @xmath56  erg  s@xmath4 ( corresponding to @xmath57  erg  s@xmath4 in the 210 kev band ) , or 4@xmath52 .",
    "this , to our knowledge , would be the first case of a radio pulsar having initial cooling emission that has x - ray luminosity comparable to or greater than its @xmath52 . given that initial cooling is thought to be unrelated to spin - down , this is not necessarily surprising .",
    "more relevant is whether the effective temperature is plausible for initial cooling . for commonly assumed neutron - star equations of state and modified urca cooling with no exotica , a temperature as high as 0.13  kev at an age of 34  kyr is reasonable",
    "if the neutron star has accreted a @xmath58  m@xmath59 hydrogen envelope @xcite . in this case , however , because of the hydrogen envelope s effect on the outgoing radiation , a black - body model as assumed here would be overestimating the true effective temperature by as much as a factor of @xmath412 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the true effective temperature may be much smaller than 0.13  kev , very much in line with predictions for initial cooling of a neutron star of this age .",
    "even if @xmath60 , as seems likely in the case of psr  j1718@xmath03718 , @xmath61 in the 210  kev band is @xmath163 orders of magnitude smaller than is observed for the five traditionally studied axps ( see , e.g. , table  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "its spectral properties are also quite different from those of the axps .",
    "this is consistent with the findings for other high-@xmath11 radio pulsars @xcite . with x - ray observations of five high - magnetic - field radio pulsars revealing luminosities much smaller than those of the axps",
    ", it is becoming more difficult to appeal to small scatter in the true @xmath11 fields relative to those inferred from spin - down .",
    "thus , it seems very plausible that the @xmath11 fields inferred from spin - down for axps and high-@xmath11 radio pulsars are not reliable estimators of the true surface field , at least to within a factor of @xmath412 .",
    "alternatively there could be a `` hidden '' parameter , such as mass , that differentiates between the two populations .",
    "intriguingly , however , psr  j1718@xmath03718 s x - ray luminosity is comparable to that of the recently identified transient axp xte  j1810@xmath0197 when in quiescence @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quiescent spectrum of xte  j1810@xmath0197 as observed in a serendipitous _ rosat _ observation @xcite is comparable to that seen for psr  j1718@xmath03718 , i.e. well described by a simple absorbed black body of temperature @xmath62  kev .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility that psr  j1718@xmath03718 , and other high-@xmath11 radio pulsars , may one day emit transient magnetar - like emission , and conversely that the transient axps might be more likely to exhibit radio pulsations .",
    "both these possibilities can be tested observationally .",
