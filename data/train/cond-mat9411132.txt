    "18.5pt    in a recent article  @xcite blte and nienhuis performed numerical investigations of what they termed the fully - packed loop ( fpl ) model .",

    "the boltzmann weight of such a filling set of paths is just the exponential of the number of paths , i.e. the energy of a configuration is the number of closed loops used to cover the lattice .",
