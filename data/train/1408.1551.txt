    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite is an effect by which a medium is rendered transparent to a weak ( probe ) light field .",
    "this happens due to the manipulation of medium s optical properties by a strong ( control ) light field .",
    "eit has applications in many areas such as high precision spectroscopy @xcite , atomic clocks @xcite , slow light @xcite , fast light @xcite , _",
    "etc_. harris _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that the presence of a strong control field leads to a narrow transparency window in the absorption profile of a probe @xcite .",
    "further , it is noticed that in the limit of absorption going to zero , the dispersion profile shows a sharp variation over the spectral range of the window .",
    "a positive slope of the dispersion in this narrow spectral region leads to slow light @xcite , while a negative slope makes light faster @xcite .",
    "currently , applications of slow light is hindered due to a practical difficulty .",
    "this stems from the fact that , a narrow width of the transparency window gives rise to a large time - delay and high absorption , whereas a broad width will lead to a very small time - delay and less absorption .",
    "hence , to optimize the outcome of any slow - light experiment , a quantity termed as delay - bandwidth product ( dbp ) has been introduced by tidstrom _",
    "dbp is the product of time - delay and the spectral width of transparency window .",
    "it is used to characterize the performance of slow light devices .",
    "the main difficulty in producing slow light is to get a delay that is comparable to the inverse of the probe pulse width without causing any distortion to the pulse .",
    "we show that an atom - molecule coupled system at low energy is useful to overcome this difficulty .",
    "in general , it is difficult to generate slow light in a molecular system because of the complex level structure of the molecules unlike that in an atomic gas .",
    "recent advances in the creation of ultracold diatomic molecules in a specific rovibrational level by associating ultracold atoms open up prospects for using molecular states for coherent control of light propagation .",
    "one of the prominent methods to associate cold atoms into molecules is photoassociation ( pa ) @xcite .",
    "there is another method of association of ultracold atoms to form a class of exotic molecules known as feshbach molecules @xcite .",
    "this is based on three - body interactions in the presence of a magnetic field tunable feshbach resonance . in this work",
    "we do not consider feshbach molecules and focus only on usual molecular states .",
    "( color online ) schematic diagram of the model system .",
    "the initial state @xmath3 is coupled to the state @xmath4 via a probe field with frequency @xmath5 and the state @xmath4 is coupled to the continuum @xmath6 via a control field with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a quasi - bound state coupled to the continuum via interaction @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the spontaneous linewidth for @xmath11 transition . ]",
    "we consider a model consisting of 3 diatomic molecular bound states and the collisional continuum of two ground state atoms in a pump - probe @xmath0-type configuration as shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "there are two approaches to solve the problem of a continuum - bound coupled system , one is quasi - continuum @xcite and the other is structured continuum approach @xcite .",
    "the latter approach was introduced more than 50 years ago by fano , who showed that a system coupled to a continuum can lead to quantum interference effects in spectral profile@xcite . in his work on quantum mechanical study of autoionizing states",
    ", he showed that quantum interference can originate from the interaction of a bound state with a continuum .",
    "further , he explicitly showed that the photoionization spectrum of a bound state coupled to both autoionizing state as well as continuum can be made zero in a certain parameter regime .",
    "this vanishing of photoionization is because of destructive interference between two different excitation pathways . in the case of autoionization ,",
    "the two pathways are direct excitation from bound to continuum and indirect excitation from bound to continuum via autoionization state .",
    "it was theoretically predicted by paspalakis _",
    "@xcite , that fano interference arising form the interaction of an autoionizing medium and a short pulse can lead to soliton - like pulse propagation .",
    "structured continuum and resulting quantum interference effects similar to those in autoionization also arise in pa in the presence of magnetic feshbach resonance ( mfr ) @xcite . early experimental works showing suppression of photoassociative atom loss due to tunable mfr induced continuum structure were carried out by vuletic and coworkers @xcite and chin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown fano profile and dark resonance in two - photon pa .",
    "et al . _ have observed fano - like asymmetric spectral profile in pa in the presence of mfr@xcite . stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) with structured continuum",
    "have been used for an efficient formation of cold molecules@xcite .",
    "recently , dumke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and winkler _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have showed the presence of eit like feature in atom - molecule coupled systems .",
    "in this paper we study light propagation through an atom - molecule resonantly interacting medium .",
    "we assume that the system is initially prepared in the ground molecular state by raman pa @xcite or by mfr in the presence of radio - frequency field @xcite .",
    "further , one of the states in the system is a feshbach resonant collisional continuum as schematically shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we then use fano theory to reduce the composite system of bound state interacting with the continuum into a single broadened discrete state .",
    "this system under the presence of strong control field shows eit like feature .",
    "we find that with the decrease in the feshbach resonance width , the width of the transparency window becomes very narrow and the absorption goes to zero .",
    "we exploit these features to reduce significantly the group velocity of the propagating weak pulse and to increase the output transmission efficiency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "a , we introduce our model system . in sec.ii b ,",
    "we study the dynamics of the system and describe the linear susceptibility of the probe . in sec.ii c ,",
    "we analyze the linear response of the medium in steady state for various cases . in sec.ii d",
    ", we numerically study the pulse propagation effects for both gaussian and hyperbolic secant pulses and discuss how to optimize dbp for this system .",
    "finally in sec.iii we summarize our results and make comments on the applications of the predicted slow light effects .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-type atom - molecule coupled system .",
    "our model is schematically shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being two molecular bound states , @xmath8 representing a quasibound or predissociating state embedded in the continuum @xmath6 of scattering states of two ground state atoms .",
    "the excited rovibrational state @xmath4 is coupled to the rovibrational state @xmath3 in an electronic molecular ground state by a weak probe field with frequency @xmath5 and to the continuum @xmath6 by a strong control field with frequency @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the two fields are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the slowly varying electric field envelope , @xmath14 is the unit polarization vector , @xmath15 is the laser field frequency and @xmath16 is the wave number of the field .",
    "the index @xmath17 denotes the probe ( @xmath18 ) and control ( @xmath19 ) field , respectively .",
    "the proposed scheme may be realized in a degenerate or near - degenerate molecular gas prepared in a single vibrational and rotational state in electronic ground - state potential .",
    "recently , the production of ultracold krb molecular gas in high phase space density has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . for numerical illustration of our work ,",
    "we take the singlet electronic ground state @xmath20 of krb with the vibrational level @xmath21 as @xmath3 . the electronic excited state @xmath22 with the vibrational level @xmath23",
    "is assumed to be @xmath4 which is coupled to @xmath3 and @xmath6 by two coherent fields , namely a weak probe field with wavelength 690 nm and a control field with wavelength 970 nm , respectively .",
    "the existence of a quasi - bound state @xmath8 is assumed to model a mfr under two - channel approximation , where one of the channels that can support @xmath8 is closed , and the other channel is open implying that the continuum of scattering states @xmath6 belong to open channel .",

    "the flat continuum states @xmath6 also gets modified by the interaction @xmath9 to produce the dressed continuum states @xmath27 .",
    "the bound to dressed continuum dipole moment @xmath28 is related to bound to flat continuum dipole moment @xmath29 as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the matrix element of dipole moment between the ground and excited molecular electronic states , and @xmath32 is the well - known fano asymmetry parameter expressed as    @xmath33    and @xmath34 is the half - width of the structure in the continuum @xmath6 due to the embedding of the discrete state @xmath8 . in the case of feshbach resonance , @xmath35 can be identified with the width of the resonance . in the dressed continuum picture ,",

    "we can notice from fig.[fig : fig4 ] that for @xmath34 = @xmath76 , the transparency window becomes very narrow and the absorption goes to zero .",
    "however , with the increase in @xmath34 , the width of the absorption profile increases , because the probability of transitions from ground state @xmath3 to the two dressed states @xmath73 and @xmath74 increases .",
    "this increase in the width of the absorption profile leads to a decrease in the width of the transparency window along with an increase in the absorption .",

    "( [ equation19 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ equation20 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ equation18 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the group velocity of the pulse and is given by @xmath94 and the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) is denoted by @xmath95 and is defined as @xmath96 for a positive @xmath93 , the group delay is @xmath97 and is expressed as @xmath98 one can see from the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ equation22 ] ) that group index @xmath82 depends upon the slope of the dispersion .",
    "the slope of the dispersion can be manipulated by changing @xmath53 .",
    "hence the group index @xmath82 decreases with increase of @xmath53 as shown in fig.[fig : fig5 ] .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ equation21 ] ) that real and imaginary parts of both the refractive index @xmath99 and gvd play an important role to modify the amplitude and width of the incident probe pulse .",
    "therefore the amplitude reduction and spreading of the pulse width leads to shape distortion along the length of the propagation .",
    "the main aim is to obtain distortion and absorption less pulse propagation with large group delay .",
    "this can be achieved by tailoring the dispersion of the medium using coherent control field . for this purpose",
    "we study the propagation of probe pulse with two different shapes namely , a gaussian pulse and a hyperbolic secant pulse in this medium .",
    "we numerically integrate the output pulse using eq .",
    "( [ equation18 ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig : fig6 ] shows pulse envelope for both the gaussian and hyperbolic secant pulse at different propagation distances . from fig.[fig : fig6 ] , we notice a considerable slowing down of the probe pulse . for the parameters of krb molecules",
    ", we find that both the gaussian and hyperbolic secant pulses have a pulse delay of @xmath100 ms for 1 cm length of propagation . the group velocity @xmath93 calculated from the pulse delay as in eq .",
    "( [ equation24 ] ) and that from eq .",
    "( [ equation22 ] ) are in good agreement , and is about @xmath101 m s@xmath1 .",
    "the transmissions through 1 cm are found to be 32.0@xmath2 and 34.0@xmath2 for the gaussian and the hyperbolic secant pulses , respectively .",
    "further one has to note that the distortion inflicted to the pulse can be minimized by keeping the spectral width of the pulse well inside the transparency window .",
    "next , we calculate dbp which is a good figure of merit for slow light experiment as mentioned earlier .",
    "figure.[fig : fig7 ] shows the variation of dbp and transmission as a function of @xmath53 . from this figure",
    "we see that as @xmath53 increases , dbp decreases .",
    "this is because of the fact that the rate of decrease in the time - delay of pulse is very high in comparison to the rate of increase of the transparency width .",
    "therefore , the product of time - delay and the spectral width of the transparency window _",
    "i.e. _ , dbp decreases with the increase in @xmath53 .",
    "we can also notice from fig.[fig : fig7 ] that the transmission increases with the increase of @xmath53 .",
    "the increase in transmission is due to the increase in the transparency window caused by increasing @xmath53 .",
    "generally , in a slow light experiment , a very low time delay corresponds to a high bandwidth , where as a very high time delay corresponds to a low bandwidth .",
    "therefore , one needs to optimize dbp to create a balance between time delay and the bandwidth for efficient slow light applications .",
    "the optimum dbp in our system is estimated to be around 355 , which corresponds to @xmath53 of 0.15 @xmath10 , a pulse delay of @xmath102 ms and a transmission of 51.0@xmath2 for a gaussian pulse with a spectral width of 12 khz . as mentioned above a main challenge in the slow light experiment",
    "is to get a delay equal to the pulse width without any distortion .",
    "here we find that a gaussian pulse of width 0.007 @xmath10 or equivalently 12 khz propagating a distance of 1 cm through the medium can exhibit a delay of @xmath103 ms for @xmath53 of 0.36 @xmath104 .",
    "this amount of delay is nearly equal to the inverse of pulse width .",
    "also the pulse is broadened by merely 2@xmath2 and the transmission of the pulse is found to be 76.0@xmath2 .",
    "( color online ) delay - bandwidth product ( solid blue line ) and transmission ( red long dashed line ) against @xmath53 ( in unit of @xmath10 ) are plotted .",
    "other parameters remain same as in fig.[fig : fig3 ] . ]",
    "in summary , we have studied theoretically a realistic model for pulse propagation in a @xmath0-type atom - molecule coupled system .",
    "we have shown that the width of the transparency window can be controlled by both the stimulated linewidth due to control field as well as feshbach resonance width .",
    "hence , by controlling the feshbach resonance width , one can significantly reduce the group velocity of the pulses and also increase the transmittance .",
    "we have also shown that a narrow transparency window can lead to a very low group velocity and the spectral width of the pulse should remain well inside the transparency window for distortionless pulse propagation .",
    "our model can be applied to those ultracold homo- or hetero - nuclear molecules for which the constituents atoms should exhibit narrow feshbach resonance in ground - state collisions .",
    "we have optimized dbp for an atom - molecule coupled model system for a pulse with spectral width of 12 khz .",
    "the optimum dbp for this system is found to be 355 .",
