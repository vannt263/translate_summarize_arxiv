    "interference effects under multiple light scattering in optically thick disordered media have been subject to intense investigation for almost three decades .",
    "coherent backscattering ( cbs ) , which is closely related to weak localization , is one of the striking examples of the types of effects which can occur .",
    "cbs manifest itself in an enhancement in the intensity of light scattered in the nearly backwards direction .",
    "wave scattering in this direction along reciprocal , or time - reversed , multiple scattering paths preserves the relative phase , which results in constructive interference .",
    "the first detailed observations and analysis of this effect for light were made in @xcite-@xcite and by now cbs in solids and liquids has been investigated in detail @xcite-@xcite .",
    "observation of cbs of light in atomic gases is complicated because atomic motion causes random phase shifts of scattering waves which are different for reciprocal paths .",
    "for this reason , the weak localization has been observed only for a cold atomic ensemble .",
    "the first experiments on cbs in ultracold atomic samples prepared in a magneto - optical trap @xcite-@xcite shown that there are a range of interesting features of this phenomena compared with cbs observed earlier for solids and liquids @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these features , which have their origin in the atomic nature of the scatterers , could not be understood and quantitatively described by approaches developed previously for classical scatterers such as powders and suspensions .",
    "detailed treatments of cbs , taking into account the quantum nature of atomic scatterers , was developed by several groups @xcite-@xcite . in these papers",
    "different aspects of weak localization were considered .",
    "particularly it was shown that one can have a strong influence on the observed interferences by reinforcing those scattering channels which lead to interference and suppressing those which do not .",
    "such desirable effects can be realized for example by polarization of atomic angular moments . by means of optical orientation effects",
    "it is possible to collect all atoms in one zeeman sublevels ensuring the fulfillment of optimal interference .",
    "similar effects can be achieved by applying an auxiliary static magnetic field and tuning the frequency of the light in such a way that light would interact only with the desire zeeman sublevel @xcite .",
    "experiment @xcite has shown that a static external field influences the process of multiple scattering and the associated interferences . at the same time",
    "it is well known that control of optical properties of matter by means of auxiliary quasiresonant electromagnetic fields is much more effective than by a static one .",
    "electromagnetically induced atomic coherence changes the optical properties of atomic samples in sometimes dramatic ways , and is responsible for such effects as population trapping , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , `` slow light '' , `` stopped light , '' to name a few @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to analyze how a resonant control field influences coherent backscattering of light .",
    "in particular , we consider cbs effects under conditions of electro - magnetically induced transparency . our attention",
    "is focused on the spectral dependence of the relative amplitude of the backscattering cone in a steady - state regime , i.e. on the dependence of dthe enhancement factor on frequency of scattered light which assumed to be monochromatic .",
    "we show that a control field can essentially change the type of interference and even can cause destructive interference .",
    "for some scattering polarization channels and for some detunings of the probe light , the enhancement factor can be less than one . with the developed knowledge of the spectrum we also consider the dynamics of cbs in the case of pulsed probe radiation .",
    "one of main quantitative characteristics of cbs is the enhancement factor , which determines the relative contribution of interference effects to the total scattered light intensity . in experiment",
    "it is measured as the relative amount of light intensity scattered into a given direction inside cbs cone to the background intensity registered outside the cone . in theory",
    "it is more convenient to evaluate the differential cross section of scattering from the input to outgoing mode and calculate the enhancement factor as the ratio of this cross section to its non - interfering part .",
    "our theoretical approach allowing calculation of the differential cross section of light scattered from optically thick ultracold atomic ensembles is described in details in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this approach is based on a diagrammatic technique for nonequilibrium systems and allows us to obtain separately both interfering and noninterfering parts as a series over a number of incoherent scatterings .",
    "the generalization of this approach to the case of the presence of a coherent control field was made in @xcite and @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we show , as an example , the double scattering contributions to the differential cross section . on the basis of these and similar expressions for higher order scattering contributions , we calculate here the spectral dependence of the enhancement factor .",
    "we consider probe light scattering from ultracold clouds of @xmath0rb atoms , prepared in a magneto - optical trap after the trapping and repumping lasers and the quadrupole magnetic field are switched off .",
    "all atoms populate the f=1 hyperfine sublevel of the ground state , while the distribution over zeeman sublevels is uniform .",
    "the spatial distribution of atoms is assumed to be spherically symmetric and gaussian . for the typical conditions of the trap ,",
    "the doppler width is many times smaller than the natural line width of the excited state and the interatomic distances on average are much larger than the optical wavelength ( dilute medium ) .",
    "this allows us to neglect all effects associated with atomic motion , and atomic collisions .",
    "probe radiation is quasi resonant with the @xmath1 transition of the @xmath2 line ( see fig . 1 ) and its polarization can be arbitrary .",
    "however , for definiteness we will consider right or left - handed circularly polarized light . this light is assumed to be weak ; all nonlinear effects connected with the probe radiation will be neglected . in our calculations",
    "this field will be taken into account only in the first non - vanishing order .",
    "besides the probe light , the atomic ensemble interacts with a coupling , control field . in this paper",
    "we will consider this field tuned to exact resonance with @xmath3 transition .",
    "its amplitude is determined by the rabi frequency @xmath4 @xmath5 are the transition matrix elements for the coupling mode between states @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 and algebraic factors depending on corresponding clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "@xmath9    [ f1 ]    the polarization of the control field is assumed to be right handed and circular .",
    "the detuning of the probe laser frequencies from the corresponding atomic resonances is assumed to be much less than the hyperfine splitting .",
    "this circumstance , along with the relatively large hyperfine splitting in the excited state , allows us take into account only one hyperfine sublevel @xmath10 of this state .    in this paper",
    "we will not focus our attention on the angular distribution and shape of the cbs cone , but will instead restrict ourselves by consideration of exact backscattering only .",
    "the ground state hyperfine splitting of @xmath11 is about 6.83 ghz , so rayleigh and elastic raman scattering ( associated with the @xmath12 transition ) is well spectrally separated from inelastically raman scattered light @xmath13 .",
    "we will assume spectral selection under photo detection .",
    "the inelastic raman component is assumed to be not registered .",
    "depending on the type of polarization analyzer used for photodetection , four main polarization schemes can be considered @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 represents the helicity of the input and outgoing light .",
    "note that , despite homogeneous population of the zeeman sublevels , the susceptibility tensor becomes essentially anisotropic due to the presence of the coupling field @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in such a case the enhancement factor depends not only on the relative polarizations of the input and output light but also on their specific types .",
    "the results of calculations of the spectrum of the enhancement factor for a weak control field are shown in fig .",
    "2a . the calculations were performed for an atomic cloud with a gaussian radius equal to @xmath16 ; maximal density is @xmath17 .",
    "the rabi frequency of the control field is @xmath18 . for a weak control field",
    "we observe a not particularly surprising behavior of the spectrum . against a background typical for the spectral dependence of cbs effect",
    "we see narrow spectral gap which has its origin in the decreasing of the optical depth of the cloud caused by the eit phenomena . under the eit effect",
    "the probability of higher order scattering relatively decreases compared with single scattering and all interference effects which connect with multiple scattering are reduced .",
    "the width of the gap in the spectrum is about the width of the transparency window determined by the eit phenomenon .",
    "we point out only that there is a certain difference in the width for different polarization channels caused by the above - mentioned optical anisotropy of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the situation changes dramatically when the control rabi frequency becomes comparable to or larger than the spontaneous decay rate . in fig .",
    "2b , which is calculated for @xmath19 , in addition to the more noticeable anisotropy , an essential transformation of the spectrum takes place .",
    "the range of the structure of this spectrum connects with the difference in the autler - townes splitting for different zeeman transitions .",
    "the latter is caused by different dipole moments of the corresponding transitions and consequently with different rabi frequencies for them .",
    "the maximal value of the enhancement factor for polarization channels with changing helicity is almost the same as for weak control field but for the case with preserving helicity we see qualitative modifications .",
    "the main one of these is that , instead of constructive interference for some spectral regions , we observe destructive interference . in these regions , for channels @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the enhancement factor becomes less than unity .",
    "that is , in place of a cbs cone we have a cbs gap , or anticone . in spite of the relatively small value of the gap it seems physically important because cbs or weak localization itself in its traditional  interpretation connects with time - reversal and always causes enhancement in back scattering .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23    [ fig2 ]    a similar effect for scattering of polarized electrons in a solid was shown in @xcite . following this ,",
    "antilocalization in electron transport has been widely studied in a range of physical systems where electrons interact directly with magnetic impurities and where the spin - orbit interaction is important @xcite . the possibility to observe destructive interference in the case of light scattering from ultracold atomic ensemble",
    "was predicted for the first time in @xcite .",
    "this effect was explained in @xcite by the hyperfine interaction in atoms and by possible interference of transitions through different hyperfine sublevels of excited atomic states . in the case",
    "considered now , the mechanism of antilocalization is different .",
    "this is emphasized by fig .",
    "2b , in which the results are obtained for only one excited state sublevel @xmath24 without taking into account possible hyperfine interactions .",
    "the fundamental possibility of destructive interference under multiple scattering connected with the coupling field is illustrated in fig .",
    "we show double backscattering of a positive helicity incoming photon from the probe light beam on a system consisting of two @xmath25rb atoms ; the exit channel consists of detection of light also of positive helicity . here",
    "the double scattering is a combination of the raleigh - type and raman - type transitions . in the direct path",
    "the scattering consists of a sequence of rayleigh - type scattering in the first step and of raman - type scattering in the second one . in the reciprocal path ,",
    "raman - type scattering occurs first , and the positive helicity photon undergoes rayleigh - type scattering in the second step .",
    "there is an important difference in the transition amplitudes associated with raleigh process for these two interfering channels .",
    "indeed , in the direct and reciprocal path the scattered mode is coupled with different zeeman transitions . in the absence of a coupling field",
    "these transitions have the same amplitude and we always have constructive interference .",
    "the coupling field essentially modifies the scattering process and this modification is different for different zeeman transitions . for definite frequencies of probe light , the scattering amplitudes connecting",
    "the direct and reciprocal scattering channels can be comparable in absolute value but can have phases shifted by an angle close to @xmath26 . in this case",
    "these two channels suppress each other .",
    "the considered example is not the only one , and appears only in the double scattering channel .",
    "there are some others which lead to constructive interference . in the higher scattering order",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "that is why in our results we have only partial destructive interference and for the considered parameters only a small suppression of backscattering .",
    "@xmath27    [ f3 ]    note that the antilocalization effect discussed in @xcite takes place for essentially nonresonant light and consequently is difficult for observation , because it is challenging to prepare clouds with large optical depth for such radiation .",
    "the effect considered here takes place for radiation which is not far from resonance .",
    "it makes this case more promising for experimental verification .",
    "note also that similar antilocalization phenomena can be observed in the case when the control field is absent but the probe radiation is strong enough to make the autler - townes splitting noticeable @xcite .",
    "consider now how these peculiarities in the spectrum manifest themselves in time dependent cbs in the case of a pulsed probe light . here",
    "the most interesting effects are observed for a weak control field when peculiarities in the spectrum are sharp .",
    "different spectral components of the input pulse scatter differently and it is the reason for the essential transformation of the spectrum and consequently the time profile of the pulse .",
    "scattered light has a deficit of near resonant photons for which the eit mechanism works best .",
    "the gap in the spectrum causes light beating effects which are different for scattering of different orders . in fig",
    "4 we show shapes of pulses which undergo single ( 4a ) and double ( 4b ) scattering for the @xmath28 polarization channel . these graphs are calculated for a cloud with @xmath29 and @xmath16 .",
    "the input pulse has a gaussian shape @xmath30 , the length of the pulse is @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33    [ f4 ]    the shapes of single and doubly scattered pulses are essentially different .",
    "most important is that the intensity peaks for them are separated in time .",
    "when single scattering intensity is maximal double scattering is very small and vice versa .",
    "this effect arises through the relative time scales associated with single scattering in comparison with double scattering , as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 . for comparison the input pulse shape",
    "is also shown .",

    "the scattering process is typically described by the differential cross section for light scattered into the solid angle @xmath35 . if the system is dilute but optically dense than the total outcome can be expressed as the sum of the contributions of the subsequent scattering events , see @xcite-@xcite @xmath36 through macroscopic electrodynamics based self - consistent averaging in the dilute disordered system , this series is converging rapidly such that any events of possible recurrent scattering ( when the atomic numerator gives @xmath37 etc . )",
