    "the displayed spectra arise from 69 locally averaged spectra contained within the filled circles .",
    "they were slightly smoothed for better display but still contain some high - frequency oscillations due to fringes in the nir spectra .",
    "the region was specifically selected because of the strong downflows and the presence of dual - component hei spectral profiles .",
    "the rainbow color code immediately reveals time intervals , where the shape of the red component significantly changes .",
    "initially , the slow and fast component form -shaped profiles with well separated minima of roughly the same intensity .",
    "their line - core intensities are in the range @xmath100.85 . at around 08:41  ut",
    ", the combined profile of the slow and fast component becomes more ` bathtub'-like , i.e. , the minima are no longer well separated .",
    "starting at 08:50  ut , the fast component becomes dominant reaching line - core intensities of @xmath11 , and the difference in line - core intensity between the slow and fast component can be as large as @xmath12 .",
    "the transition to single - component profiles begins abruptly at 09:08  ut resulting in profiles with extended wings towards higher wavelengths and in deep line cores of the slow component .",
    "the observed supersonic downflows ( up to 40  km  s@xmath4 ) at the footpoints of arch filaments near pores of an efr are in very good agreement with previous observations by , for example , @xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , magnetic field information is obviously missing in vfsm but can be provided in the future with polarimetric gfpi observations .",
    "the downflow kernel discussed above has a size of just a few seconds of arc and is located in close proximity to the pore .",
    "dual - component hei profiles with a strong fast component are continuously present in the vicinity of both pores .",
    "they are also sporadically encountered at other locations along the dark fibrils of the afs .",
    "the high - cadence gris observations reveal significant changes of the spectral line shapes on time - scales of a few minutes inside the downflow kernels .",
    "the vfsm of gris reaches a one - minute cadence comparable to imaging spectrometers by removing the dual - beam polarimeter , which increases the photon flux at the detector by a factor of two .",
    "recording just intensity spectra and not their polarization state , lowers the scanning time by a factor of four .",
    "finally , not accumulating spectra at each scan position , another factor of 810 can be gained .",
    "thus , gris / vfsm operations mirror the fiss performance and are also applicable to firs .",
    "we introduced various ways of visualizing the dynamics of efrs / afss : serial maps of physical parameters , space - time diagrams , and sequential spectra of downflow kernels with dual - component hei profiles .",
    "we also attempted applying lct to a sequence of hei line - core intensity maps .",
    "however , the fibril structure of the afs evolves too quickly to be captured inside the sampling window but tracking slower photospheric motions is possible .",
    "this article mainly deals with methodical and technical aspects of the vfsm , the detailed scientific analysis is deferred to a forthcoming article , where we will investigate , for example , if the plasma contained in arch filaments , which exhibit supersonic los downflows near the footpoints of the afs , reaches the photosphere .",
