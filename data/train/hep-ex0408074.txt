    "the lsnd oscillations signal @xcite ( event excess of 3.8 @xmath1 significance ) requires a squared neutrino mass difference of the order of 0.3 - 3 ev@xmath2 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the three neutrino picture of the standard model ( sm ) when the oscillation evidence from solar and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite is taken into account .",
    "miniboone s primary goal is to confirm or refute the oscillations interpretation of the lsnd @xmath3 excess .",
    "the neutrino beam is produced from the decay of charged mesons that are created when protons from the fermilab booster ( 8.0 gev kinetic energy ) impact a 1.7 interaction length be target .",
    "the target is placed inside a focusing horn whose polarity can be set to run in either @xmath4 or @xmath5 mode .",
    "currently the experiment runs in @xmath4 mode , and the horn increases the neutrino flux at the detector by a factor of @xmath6 5 . the detector is a 12 m diameter sphere filled with mineral oil ( hydrocarbon chain ) . its interior is covered by 1280 pmt s that gather the light produced by processes inside the tank .",
    "it is surrounded by an optically isolated veto region designed to tag cosmic rays with 240 pmt s .",
    "the transparent medium of the oil makes it primarily a cerenkov detector , although an important component of scintillation light is present in any occuring process . the charge and time response of the tank pmt s",
    "is monitored continuously with a laser system .",
    "the energy scale of electron - type events is calibrated using the spectrum of michel electrons .",
    "we use cosmic ray muons to determine the energy scale for muon - type events . the positions and angles of the incoming cosmic rays",
    "are measured with a tracking hodoscope situated above the detector and the stopping point is determined with a system of 7 scintillating cubes located throughout the detector .",
    "miniboone is presently studying three processes that will be used to tune the detector monte carlo and the reconstruction algorithms : @xmath7 charged current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) events which will be used to determine the incoming neutrino flux ; neutral current ( nc ) @xmath8 production which will account for the largest @xmath7 misidentification background to the oscillation signal ; and nc @xmath7 elastic scattering which can be used to study the optical properties of the oil .",
    "the @xmath9 oscillation analysis is a blind analysis and , as such , we have not yet looked for @xmath10 events .",
    "however , recent studies @xcite show that with 1@xmath11 protons on target ( p.o.t . )",
    "approximately @xmath12 signal events are expected for lsnd - like oscillations , as well as about @xmath13 misidentified @xmath7 interactions ( dominated by @xmath14 nc @xmath8 production ) , and about @xmath15 intrinsic @xmath10 background events .",
    "figure [ sensplot ] shows the updated sensitivity and measurement capability for this number of protons .",
    "the miniboone experiment can definitively confirm or refute the lsnd oscillation signal with 1@xmath11 p.o.t .",
    "currently , 30% of this amount has been collected .",
    "the collaboration is presently working on the analysis of @xmath7 ccqe , nc @xmath8 s and nc elastic scattering .",
    "the @xmath9 analysis is expected to produce first results in 2005 .",
    "this work is supported by the national science foundation and the department of energy .",
