    "radiative transition between vector(v ) and pseudoscalar(p ) mesons represent an important source of information on low energy hadron physics .",
    "these transitions are governed by magnetic dipole ( m1 ) radiation of the photon and had played one of the central roles for checking the predictions of quark model and su(3 ) symmetry , as well as it was very useful in the determination of the magnetic dipole moment of @xmath1 in @xmath2 process @xcite .",
    "recently the theoretical activity on the vp@xmath3 magnetic dipole transition have increased(see @xcite and references therein ) , in particular , due to the fact that the analysis of the radiative @xmath4 decay with @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons in final state can provide insights to the long standing issue of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mixing ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the usual parametrization of @xmath7 mixing in the octet ",
    "singlet basis , which will be used in this work , is as follows : the current - particle matrix elements are defined as 0 | j_5^| p(p ) = -i f_p^p_(=8;0;p=, [ eq1 ] ) where @xmath8 , the @xmath9 octet axial vector current , is given by j_5 ^ 8=(__5 u+__5 d-2__5 s ) [ eq2 ] and @xmath10 , the @xmath9 singlet current is given by : j_5 ^ 0=(__5 u+__5 d+__5 s ) [ eq3 ]    two mixing angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 are required in order to consistently describe mixing @xcite .",
    "accordingly the couplings in eq.([eq1 ] ) can be defined as follows f_^8 = f_8 cos_8 & , & f_^0 = - f_0 sin_0 + f_^8 = f_8 sin_8 & , & f_^0 = f_0 cos_0 [ eq4 ]    alternatively , two independent axial vector currents with distinct flavors can be considered j_5^q & = & ( _ _ 5 u+__5 d ) + j_5^s & = & _ _ 5s [ eq5 ] and the couplings of these currents with @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons are defined similarly to eq.([eq1 ] ) : f_^q = f_q cos_q & , & f_^q = f_q sin_q + f_^s = -f_s sin_s & , & f_^s = f_s cos_s [ eq6 ]    as we see that in each basis there are two angles and in @xcite it was shown that , to a very good accuracy , the mixing can described in terms of single angle @xmath13 since @xmath14 which is also confirmed by a qcd sum rules calculation @xcite .    in present work we will follow to the first approach , neglecting the mixing angles @xmath12 and @xmath11 due to their smallness and calculate the coupling constant of @xmath15 decay in framework of light cone qcd sum rules ( more about of light cone",
    "qcd sum rules and its applications can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we derive light cone qcd sum rules for @xmath15 decay constant , section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the sum rules and contain our conclusions .",
    "in this section we calculate the coupling constant of @xmath15 decay using light cone qcd sum rules method . in order to calculate this coupling constant",
    "we consider the following two point correlation function _ = i d^4 x e^i p_2 x  0 | t\\ { j_^(x ) j_^(0 ) } | 0 _ [ eq7 ] where @xmath3 denotes the external electromagnetic field , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the interpolating currents with @xmath5 and @xmath18 meson quantum numbers . here",
