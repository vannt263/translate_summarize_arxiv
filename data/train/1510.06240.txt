    "it occurs due to sphaleron processes  @xcite in the so - called leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the existence of similar mechanisms of type - ii  @xcite and type - iii  @xcite adds to the standard model scalar triplets , @xmath7 or right - handed fermion triplets , @xmath8 respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the hypercharge forbids their general interaction .",
    "these usual seesaw mechanisms describe a majorana mass term for the neutrinos as @xmath9 , where the neutrino mass matrix is constructed on the symmetry basis @xmath10 and the fields @xmath11 are the left - handed neutrino components , @xmath12 are the heavy right - handed singlet components and @xmath13 are the neutral fermion triplet components in the most general three fermion family model .",
    "the full diagonalization of the general @xmath14 allows one to obtain the physical neutrino eigenstates and generally carries enough phases to cp at low energies even in minimal setups  @xcite .",
    "minimal versions of these extensions with only two heavy neutral fermions ( general @xmath15 with only @xmath16 entries ) have been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite and are widely applied to the leptogenesis mechanism . since in the standard scheme there is nothing to forbid the use of a weak basis ( wb ) where the masses of heavy neutrinos ( @xmath17 ) and heavy triplets ( @xmath18 ) are real and diagonal , one can choose this wb to easily diagonalize @xmath15 .",
    "once the components of @xmath17 and/or @xmath19 are much heavier than the dirac off - diagonal components ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) one can make a block diagonalization and , in very good approximation branco:2001pq , the light neutrino sector has the non diagonal masses given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the full diagonalization is easily made since @xmath25 in this wb while the light neutrinos have the masses diagonalized by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix . even if we include more than one singlet and/or triplet , the structure of @xmath28 will still be the same , with @xmath29 and/or @xmath19 being the related diagonal submatrices .",
    "the off - diagonal zeros persist unless new content is added to the model .",
    "seesaw models introduce minimal modifications to sm content by some new particles . here",
    "we need to go beyond and insert an interaction between these new species . in the minimal version at low energies , for example , the interaction between singlets and the neutral scalar component can generate nonzero matrix elements if this interaction receives a mass term from a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a new _ ad hoc _ ( nonusual ) scalar triplet , @xmath30 , which can interact with @xmath31 and @xmath32 and , therefore , produces a new seesaw mechanism by the introduction of off - diagonal terms into @xmath15 ( specifically into the submatrix @xmath33 ) .",
    "this hybrid interaction of the types i and iii seesaw mechanisms emerges naturally from the unification when the neutrino mass problem is solved by the inclusion of an adjoint fermion representation in the minimal @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the adjoint representation has a branch to the sm group , @xmath35 , given by @xmath36 .",
    "hence , an interaction term as @xmath37 can be naturally achieved from an interaction between two fermions and a scalar adjoint representation , like @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "this content is customarily necessary to save the unification in a variety of models based on @xmath34  @xcite .    besides the similar aspects of type i and type iii seesaw mechanisms",
    ", the introduction of this peculiar interaction generates new interferences between the tree and loop levels , which contribute to raise the cp violation in the lepton sector . yet , the interplay of the different seesaw mechanisms may be important for the neutrino mass generation and should explain the small deviations from the tribimaximal mixing form of the pmns matrix  @xcite .",
    "such interactions can induce cp violation in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 decays and should be driven by a new cp source .",
    "moreover , previous studies have shown that the second heavy eigenstate may be important for leptogenesis in the thermal scenario  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry can be associated to @xmath2 ( or @xmath39 ) , which is heavier than @xmath1 , however , playing the key role for cp violation to leptogenesis . from this point of view , all cp violation generated by the two lightest eigenstates among all heavy neutral fermions should be taken into account . on the other hand , the scalar triplet @xmath3 can naturally get a vanishingly small vevv since it may be inside of the @xmath40 in the unification in @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of cp in the decay of the new fermions to @xmath3 may be important if an interaction between a fermion singlet , fermion triplet , and scalar triplet is included .",
    "it provides a new relevant cp origin and complements the usual lepton asymmetries calculated in the standard seesaw mechanisms in leptogenesis  @xcite .    to study the consequences of this kind of models we will focus on the minimal examples with only @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( 1n1 t ) and with @xmath43 and @xmath42 ( 2n1 t ) . in this vein ,",

    "we have considered a new source of cp violation in the interplay between the type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms . two minimal models with one fermion triplet plus one and two fermion singlets were studied .",
    "we have shown that the cp asymmetry generated can be enhanced to produce the expected matter - antimatter asymmetry through the leptogenesis mechanism . the main feature is due to the new majorana phase @xmath0 which is responsible for the new cp asymmetry and can not be absorbed by field redefinitions in the lagrangian , as well as the fact that the heavy neutrinos can not be in a natural diagonal basis after @xmath3 gets a vev .",
    "other connections of @xmath0 with phenomenological constraints may or may not discard the present model .",
    "hence , a low - energy connection should be necessary to restrict the model .",
    "yet , the acceptable range of @xmath186 should be used to restrict the @xmath233 and also to better understand the @xmath234 , which also may depend on @xmath186 if the imaginary part of standard yukawa couplings is nonvanishing .",
    "there is no straightforward relation to low - energy parameters since the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagmin ] ) ( especially with more than two n s and/or t s ) mixes all heavy and light eigenstates , making necessary the reconstruction of the leptonic matrix mixing in terms of known neutrino data .    by a simplified analysis",
    "we have calculated the relevant cp asymmetry considering only unflavored leptogenesis and we observed that a sufficient amount of cp violation can be obtained even if all yukawa couplings are real , whereas @xmath235 . a sufficient baryon - to - photon ratio is obtained if we consider a heavy @xmath39 ( @xmath236gev ) .",
    "this bound can be lowered if one considers the different initial abundances for @xmath39 and their connection with low - energy parameters by yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is required to avoid the so - called cosmological gravitino problem , which occurs if our scheme is embedded in a supergravity inflation theory , where the reheating temperature has an upper bound @xmath237",
    "the flavored investigation should point out some new aspects of leptogenesis in the context of the type i+iii seesaw mechanism . in this way",
    ", the study of leptogenesis in second heavier neutral fermion ( @xmath120-dominated ) scenario may appropriately constrain this model .",
    "finally , let us remark that the present study was made with only one fermion triplet .",
    "the inclusion of a second fermion triplet will give rise to new graphs and interferences which could be very tricky .",
    "the new graphs contributing to cp asymmetry arise due to the propagator of fermion triplet components and final states as well as scalar triplets . yet , a better understanding of this mechanism would be given when the broken phase is considered and @xmath28 is not diagonal in general .",
    "this modifies the mechanism presented as we rewrite the lagrangian in the mass eigenstates and may increase the final cp asymmetry .",
