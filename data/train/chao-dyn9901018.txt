    "sartorelli , gonalves , and pinto  @xcite in detail investigated a time series of dripping intervals within a narrow range of the flow rate , and they revealed that the time series has boundary crisis and tangent bifurcation for a change in the flow rate .",

    "a mass - spring model by shaw  @xcite generated a few types of attractor he obtained experimentally .",

    "@xcite    the dripping interval of pure water is affected by the diameter of a nozzle , the temperature of the water , the pressure of the water , and the flow rate of the water .",
    "all the studies mentioned above have been performed for a narrow range of the flow rate . in our experiment ,",

    "the nozzle has an inside diameter of 5 mm and an outside diameter of 7 mm .",
    "the temperature of the water in the tank ( inner tube ) was kept constant by circulating water at a constant temperature of 15  through the outer tube .",
    "the temperature of the water flowing through the needle valve was elevated with an electric heater winded around the needle valve and the nozzle .",
    "the elevated temperature was controlled by the adjustment of a constant current applied to the heater .",
    "the temperature of the drip , @xmath0 , was determined by that of the needle valve . in view of disturbance free ,",

    "the measurement of @xmath3 was made for the flow rates ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "this range was covered by 50 different adjustments of the valve .",
    "the drip temperature @xmath0 was changed at an interval of some 1  from 15  up to 27  for each adjustment of the valve .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the dependence of the flow rate @xmath2 on the temperature @xmath0 for three adjustments of the valve .",

    "the interval @xmath32 is a linearly decreasing function of @xmath31 , having a constant decrement of @xmath37 .     in a chaotic state ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows four return maps of @xmath3 , which are typical of ones obtained in the chaotic state ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 since the values of @xmath9 are different from each other , the return maps are quite different in the form .",
    "the number of the data is much smaller in the dripping spectrum than in the maps , so that very sparsely distributed dots of the map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ]  ( d ) do not appear in the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the mapping functions @xmath42 are well - defined .",
    "although some of the maps are multi - valued functions of @xmath3 , the chaotic attractors probably have low dimensions .",
    "the attractors obtained were not such high - dimensional ones as obtained by wu and schelly .",
    "since , in the stable states , the interval @xmath3 increases with @xmath9 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the volume of the drop increases .",
    "the chaotic state , however , has a decrease in the average volume , because the average of @xmath3 decreases more rapidly than @xmath43 with an increase in @xmath9 , which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the volume alternately repeats the increase and decrease with an increase in @xmath9 and therefore the increased volume in the stable state is partially compensated by the decreased volume in the chaotic states .",
    "if the increase and decrease is ignored , then the volume can be assumed to increase monotonicaly with @xmath9 in the form of @xmath44 .",
    "we observed with the naked eye that the drip vibrates when it stays on the edge of the nozzle , and also that the amplitude of the vibration depends on the flow rate .",
    "the drip on the edge , therefore , grows with the vibration into the volume of the falling drop .",
    "if the drip is torn off by its own weight irrespective of the vibration , the increase and decrease in the volume and the chaotic fluctuations in @xmath3 can not occur .",
    "our experimental results suggest that , in addition to a mechanics that the drip is torn off by its own weight , the vibration affects the behavior of @xmath3 .    in the stable state ,",
    "the volume of the drip is kept constant for the drip number @xmath29 at fixed flow rates .",
    "this suggests that the steady behavior of @xmath3 is chiefly dominated by the mechanics that the drip is torn off by its own weight .",
    "however , the behavior that the constant volume abruptly increases with @xmath9 is not explained only by the mechanics .",
    "moreover , in the chaotic state , the mechanics no longer dominates the behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the mechanics , some factors may take part in the strange behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "the vibration of the drip on the edge is the most important factor . to have a clear understanding of the chaotic behavior of the dripping interval",
    ", one would need a quantitative analysis of the vibration .",
