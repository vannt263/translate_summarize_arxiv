    "any perturbation , from small - scale convective motions to large - scale eruptions , can generate waves propagating in the solar atmosphere . according to the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) theory ,",
    "they can be identified in terms of fast - mode , alfvnic mode , or slow - mode waves .",
    "for instance , h@xmath3 moreton waves were successfully explained as coronal fast - mode magnetoacoustic waves sweeping the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "after the launch of the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) spacecraft , one of its payloads , euv imaging telescope ( eit ) , discovered a large - scale wavelike phenomenon , which was later called ",
    "eit waves \" @xcite .",
    " eit waves \" are bright fronts visible in the euv difference images , propagating outward with a typical velocity of 170350 @xcite .",
    "although the velocity might be underestimated due to the low cadence of the eit telescope @xcite , it can really be as small as @xmath4  @xcite . in the base difference images , ",
    "eit waves \" are followed by extending dimmings @xcite . upon discovery , ",
    "eit waves \" were soon explained as the fast - mode magnetoacoustic waves , i.e. , the coronal counterparts of h@xmath3 moreton waves ( or coronal moreton waves ) @xcite .",
    "the ensuing modelings @xcite and observations @xcite further claimed that the fast - mode wave model can account for the  eit waves \" .",
    "such a fast - mode wave model was first questioned by @xcite , since they found that an  eit wave \" stopped at the magnetic separatrix , which is hard to be understood in the wave model .",
    "the second discrepancy between the fast - mode wave model and observations is that the eit wave speed is typically @xmath2 times smaller than that of moreton waves @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was found that the  eit wave \" front is cospatial with the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) frontal loop @xcite , which is not expected from the fast - mode wave model . in order to reconcile these discrepancies ,",
    "many efforts have been taken , and several alternative models have been proposed , e.g. , the fieldline stretching model @xcite , the successive reconnection model @xcite , the slow - mode wave model @xcite , the current sheet model @xcite , among others ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "according to the fieldline stretching model of @xcite , a fast - mode wave should be ahead of the  eit wave \" in a cme event , providing that the observational cadence and the sensitivity are high enough .",
    "in particular , the model predicts that the fast - mode wave is @xmath2 times faster than the  eit wave \" if the magnetic configuration is semi - circular .",
    "the coexistence of a faster wave ahead of an  eit wave \" was discovered by @xcite , who revealed with the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( _ trace _ ) observations that a faint wave front with a speed of @xmath5  dispersed out of the bright  eit wave \" front , whose speed was only @xmath6 . in this letter , we report the evidence of a coexisting fast - mode wave ahead of the slower - moving  eit wave \" on 2010 july 27 , which was observed by the newly - launched _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( _ sdo _ ) mission .",
    "on 2010 july 27 , a microflare , with the solar object locator of sol2010 - 07 - 27t08:46:00l223c108 , occurred to the west side of noaa active region ( ar ) 11089 ( s24w21 ) .",
    "the microflare was located at s18w48 in the heliocentric coordinates .",
    "the goes 1 - 8  soft x - ray lightcurve shows a small bump less than a2 level from 08:46 ut to 08:56 ut .",
    "accompanying the occurrence of the tiny flare , euv waves and dimmings can be identified in the base difference images , extending from the flare site to the north for a short distance .",
    "no coronagraph observations from the _ soho _ satellite are available .",
    "the microflare was located at s22e31 in the field of view of the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( _ stereo _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a , and the its coronagraphs did not detect any cme during this event .",
    "two factors do not favor the detection of a possible cme for this event : one is that the source region is too close to the solar disk center for the _ stereo _ satellite , and the other is that the cme , if existing , should have a small angular extension as implied by the euv dimmings , and therefore is prone to be missed by coronagraphs @xcite .",
    "the microflare and the associated  eit wave \" were well documented by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ * ? ? ?",
    "the aia instrument has 10 euv and uv channels with a spatial resolution of @xmath7 . since",
    " eit waves \" are most evident at the 193  channel , we mainly use this channel to study the dynamics of the  eit wave \" .",
    "the cadence of the observation is 12 s , which allows the detection of the detailed features of",
    " eit waves \" that had not been seen before @xcite .    in order to clearly show the propagation of the faint",
    " eit waves \" , running or base difference technique was often used . throughout this paper , we rely on the percentage difference images , which are obtained by the base difference images divided by the pre - event image @xcite .",
    "the rotation of the sun is corrected . for simplicity ,",
    "the percentage difference images are mentioned as difference images or difference intensity hereafter .",
    "the evolution of the  eit wave \" event on 2010 july 27 is displayed in figure [ fig1 ] , which shows the 193  difference images at four moments .",
    "the pre - event intensity map at 08:44:55 ut is chosen as the base image that is subtracted . in this figure , the bright ( dark )",
    "pixels indicate the intensity increase ( decrease ) .",
    "it is seen that at 08:46:43 ut , a small - sized brightening occurred near ( 670 , @xmath8 ) . note that a small coronal loop with relatively stronger magnetic field was to the north at around ( 720 , @xmath9 ) , which is clearly seen in the second panel . shortly later , bright fronts appeared and began to propagate to the north .",
    "it is revealed from the attached movie ( _ basediff.mpg _ ) that the western and eastern flanks formed first . at 08:49:55 ut",
    ", the northern flank became to be dominant in brightness . until this stage , only one bright strip was evident along the northern flank . at 08:53:31 ut ,",
    "the northern flank of the brightenings swept over the small coronal loop , and was then split , presumably due to the small coronal loop .",
    "on the east side , a weak front became detached ahead of the main strip , as respectively indicated by the yellow and red arrows in the third panel of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the weak front propagated much faster than the main strip , and the two fronts were widely separated at 09:00:55 ut , as illustrated by the right panel of figure [ fig1 ] . on the west side ,",
    "only a bright strip is discernable by eyes , which propagated quickly .    in order to investigate the dynamics of the wave fronts more quantitatively ,",
    "we analyze the time evolution of the brightness distributions along two slices , a and b , which are separated by the small coronal loop at ( 720 , @xmath9 ) as indicated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the two slices are both great circles along the solar surface linking the flare site . the results are displayed in figure [ fig2 ] as a space - time plot , where any oblique pattern means a propagating front .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] displays the evolution of the wave front propagation along slice a. we can identify several fronts : f1 , f2 , and s1 .",
    "front f1 appeared first , which was propagating with a high velocity of 560  until 08:52:44 ut .",
    "we interpret it as a fast - mode wave .",
    "a separate bright front s1 was propagating with an initial speed of 190  since 08:52:00 ut .",
    "its speed was decreasing .",
    "after 09:02:28 ut , front s1 stopped at a distance of @xmath10 from the flare site .",
    "we identify it as the classical  eit wave \" .",
    "front s1 might be already existing during the period from 08:49:04 ut to 08:52:00 ut , but it is almost undistinguishable from the fast front f1 in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that an additional wave pattern , front f2 , emanated from front s1 at the distance of @xmath11 from the flare site at 08:54:54 ut .",
    "this weak front propagated with a speed of 310 .",
    "we interpret it as a fast - mode wave .",
    "an important reason is that after a distance of @xmath12 the fast front f1 began to decelerate , and propagated with almost the same speed as front f2 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] illustrates the wave front propagation along slice b. the wave pattern here is very simple . besides a fast - moving bright front",
    ", f3 , which had a velocity of 470 , there is a weak front , s2 , propagating outward with a velocity of 170 .",
    "we identify the faster front f3 as a fast - mode wave and the slower front s2 as an  eit wave \" .",
    "since the discovery ,  eit waves \" were widely explained as fast - mode magnetoacoustic waves , or coronal moreton waves , as reviewed in  [ sect : intro ] .",
    "however , many of their characteristics can not be explained in the framework of fast - mode waves , which stimulated @xcite to doubt the wave nature of the  eit waves \" .",
    "based on mhd simulations , @xcite proposed a magnetic fieldline stretching model , i.e. ,  eit waves \" are not fast - mode waves , they are apparent propagation of the brightenings from the compressed plasma generated by successive stretching of the magnetic field lines overlying the erupting flux rope .",
    "the model predicts that there should be a sharp fast - mode wave , or coronal moreton wave , which is piston - driven by the erupting flux rope and propagates ahead of the  eit waves \" .",
    "the speed of the faster wave is just the local fast - mode magnetoacoustic wave speed ; however , the  eit wave \" speed is determined by both local parameters and the magnetic configuration . according to this model , if the coronal magnetic field lines are semi - circles , the  eit wave \" should be @xmath2 times slower than the fast - mode wave . if the coronal field has a strongly stretched configuration , the resulting  eit wave \" has a very low speed @xcite , and is close to zero near a magnetic separatrix .",
    "such a fieldline stretching model , which was originally based on 2-dimensional simulations , was recently backed by 3-dimensional mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the coronal moreton waves are so fast that at most one front can be detected with the low - cadence ( @xmath13 min ) observations of the _ soho_/eit telescope , e.g. , the sharp front in fig .",
    "1 of @xcite is definitely a coronal moreton wave front .",
    "their propagation can be caught only with a higher cadence . however , even with a cadence of 2.5 min , the extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ) aboard _ stereo _ still has not detected a coronal moreton wave ahead of any  eit wave \" . up to now",
    ", the existence of a coronal moreton wave ahead of the  eit wave \" was implied by the filament winking @xcite , and the only direct evidence was revealed by @xcite with the _ trace _ observations , though @xcite studied the same event and claimed that there is no wave front ahead of the  eit wave \" . according to ",
    "[ sect : res ] , it is seen that the high - resolution observations of the _ sdo_/aia imaging telescope convincingly revealed that there is another faster wave propagating ahead of the slower wave , either along slice a or slice b as marked in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we interpret the slower wave , i.e. , fronts s1 and s2 in figure [ fig2 ] , as ",
    "eit waves \" , and the faster waves , i.e. , fronts f1f3 in figure [ fig2 ] , as the fast - mode magnetoacoustic wave , or coronal moreton wave .    along slice",
    "a , the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] clearly shows that the slower front s1 propagated outward with bright and diffuse fronts and with an initial speed of 190 , which are the typical characteristics of  eit waves \" @xcite . during the propagation",
    ", the front s1 decelerated , and became almost stationary after 09:02:40 ut , when the front was at a distance of 250  from the flare site .",
    "previously , the data analysis of @xcite indicated that  eit waves \" stop at the footpoints of a magnetic separatrix .",
    "this feature was successfully explained by @xcite in terms of the fieldline stretching model , i.e. , the magnetic field across the magnetic separatrix belongs to another flux system , and hence are not involved in the stretching process .",
    "therefore ,  eit waves \" can not go across the magnetic separatrix . to confirm such a conclusion , we plot in figure [ fig3 ] the coronal magnetic field near the eruption site , which is extrapolated based on the _ soho_/michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) magnetogram @xcite with the potential field source - surface model @xcite .",
    "the arrow in the figure points to the location where the  eit wave \" front stopped . we can see that it is indeed cospatial with the magnetic separatrix .    the coronal moreton wave , front f1 in the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] , which is fast - mode wave in nature",
    ", does not care the existence of the magnetic separatrix at the distance of 250  from the flare site .",
    "it propagated across it , though its speed decreased ( due to weaker magnetic field ) as inferred from its declined slope in the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , one feature that is not expected is the second fast wave front f2 in the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "apparently it emanated from the bright  eit wave \" front at 08:55:00 ut when the  eit wave \" front was at a distance of @xmath14 from the flare site .",
    "checking the euv images in figure [ fig1 ] , we find that there is a small - sized coronal loop situated at such a distance , with a relatively stronger magnetic field as mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : res ] .",
    "therefore , we hypothesize that front f2 is due to the fast - mode magnetoacoustic wave near the west side of the small coronal loop being diffracted to propagate to the east .",
    "this is reinforced by the movie ( _ basedif.mpg _ ) attached with figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "along slice b , the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] presents a bright front ( f3 ) with a propagation speed of 470  and another faint front behind ( s2 ) with a speed of 170 .",
    "apparently the faster wave seems to be an ordinary  eit wave \" in the sense that an expanding dimming was immediately following .",
    "however , we interpret it as the coronal moreton wave , i.e. , a fast - mode wave , because it was moving together with the coronal moreton wave on slice a. besides , there is a very faint reflected wave in the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] when the faster wave f2 approached the small coronal loop at 08:52:30 ut , which is a typical characteristic of fast - mode waves .",
    "moreover , this faster wave has fronts sharper than  eit waves \" . telling the nature of the slower front s2",
    "is not straightforward since it was so weak that it is even not discernable from the difference images in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "since this front had a typical speed for  eit waves \" , we tentatively explain it as an eit wave .",
    "it is seen that the eit wave front along slice b was much weaker than that along slice a. the possible reason is that the magnetic field lines overlying the eruption site were mainly oriented along the direction of slice a as illustrated by figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "according to the fieldline stretching model of @xcite , as these field lines are pushed to stretch up , compression would be formed at the legs of these field lines .",
    "therefore , bright ",
    "eit wave \" fronts are visible along slice a. the fast - mode wave , however , is always refracted toward the region with weak magnetic field @xcite , and has nothing to do with the magnetic connectivity .",
    "this is why the coronal moreton wave is extremely bright along slice b ( where the magnetic field is weak ) and faint along slice a.    it is interesting to note that , either along slice a or slice b , the coronal moreton wave was moving with a speed @xmath2 times higher than that of the following  eit wave \" , consistent with the prediction of the fieldline stretching model of @xcite when semi - circular magnetic configuration is assumed .",
    "@xcite predicted that the fast - mode wave ahead of the  eit wave \" was missed by _",
    "soho_/eit due to its low cadence of @xmath15 min , and would be observed by imaging telescopes with a higher cadence .",
    "however , after the launch of the _ stereo _ mission , the euvi instrument with a high cadence of 2.5 min still did not catch the fast - mode wave @xcite .    to check the eligibility of _ stereo_/euvi in detecting the possible fast - mode wave ahead of the  eit wave \" , we degrade the temporal resolution of the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] from 12 s to 2.5 min , and re - plot it in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it is seen that the wave pattern becomes messy , and we can not distinguish a faster wave from the  eit wave \" .",
    "this means that , for an ",
    "eit wave \" event like that on 2010 july 27 , the 2.5-min cadence of euv imaging observations even with a spatial resolution of @xmath16 can not detect the fast - mode wave ( or coronal moreton wave ) ahead of the  eit wave \" .",
    "we change the cadence and find that only if the observational cadence is shorter than 70 s can the fast - mode wave be distinguished from the  eit wave \" for the 2010 july 27 event .    with _",
    "stereo_/euvi observations , @xcite did show a weak fast - mode wave component besides the ordinary  eit wave \" .",
    "they found that the fast - mode wave was coupled with the  eit wave \" when the cme was expanding laterally , and the two waves ultimately decoupled when the  eit wave \" front became stationary .",
    "such a result may result from the low cadence of the _",
    "stereo_/euvi data , as people can get the same impression from figure [ fig4 ] . with a high cadence of 12 s , figure [ fig2 ] clearly reveals that the fast - mode wave was already distinct from the  eit wave \" front before the  eit wave \" stopped .",
    "to summarize , we analyzed the ",
    "eit wave \" event on 2010 july 27 with the _ sdo_/aia data .",
    "it is seen that even for a tiny flare , the high - resolution observations of the _ sdo_/aia telescope still revealed many wave patterns . in this letter",
    ", we found that a fast - mode magnetoacoustic wave was propagating ahead of the  eit wave \" .",
    "as predicted by the fieldline stretching model of @xcite , the fast - mode wave had a speed @xmath2 times higher than that of the  eit wave \" .",
    "the fast - mode wave kept propagating after the  eit wave \" stopped at the magnetic separatrix .",
    "our results are strongly suggestive of that ",
    "eit waves \" are not fast - mode magnetoacoustic waves , and can be well explained by our fieldline stretching model .",
