    "let us to discuss the practical situations . in the case of",
    "the highly doped leads the normalized pumped current ( @xmath82 ) generated by the oscillating thin barriers tends to a limited value at the dirac point .",

    "assuming typical values in the experiments for other parameters , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we have a pumped current around @xmath93 na .",
    "it is due to the efficient contribution of the evanescent modes in the pumped current generated by the vibrating thin barriers .",

    "the minimum of the pumped current , arising due to the contribution of the evanescent modes , depends on the pump configuration and it has not a universal value in spite of the ref . @xcite . also , the pumped current changes sign around the dirac point due to the opposite contributions of the evanescent and extended modes . on the other hand ,",
    "new features appear in the case of the vibrating thin barriers .",
    "the pumped current has an increasing oscillatory behavior around zero as a function of the carrier concentration .",
    "it is due to the increasing contribution of the extended modes in the pumped current by increasing the carrier concentration .",
    "comparison with the similar normal pump indicates that it is a unique feature of the dirac fermions .",
    "also , the normalized pumped current diverges at the dirac point due to the more effective contribution of the evanescent modes when the thin barriers have nonzero magnitudes . due to these facts",
    ", we can conclude that driving by oscillating and vibrating thin barriers are very effective methods to generate a pumped current in graphene .",
    "thus , despite of the practical difficulties for experimental realization of the considered pump we believe that it has a more chance to be confirmed in the experiment .",
    "we have considered the thin potential barriers as a delta function potentials in our calculations .",
    "it is a limited situation and in practice we expect a determinate width for the thin potential barriers .",
