    "string theory is a powerful tool for probing the strongly coupled dynamics of gauge theory , physics which is of vital importance especially in the context of the strong nuclear interactions .",
    "gauge / string correspondences have enlarged and refined the toolbox available for such studies , and there is a large literature on the subject , with several powerful examples such as the ads / cft correspondence@xcite and deformations thereof@xcite .",
    "however , we are still some way from describing the `` realistic '' dynamics of qcd using this approach .",
    "the main challenges that remain include getting access to low @xmath0 , fully including dynamical quarks in the fundamental representation of @xmath1 , and getting reliable control of the non  supersymmetric regime .",
    "it is to be hoped ( if not expected ) that even if we can not obtain a controllable string dual of qcd , there may be considerable progress to be made in capturing physical phenomena that are in the same universality class as those of qcd .",
    "this is the motivation of the present work , which is part of a series of studies upon which we hope to report new and interesting results .",
    "we study the geometry of ads@xmath2schwarzschild @xmath3 , which is the decoupled / near  horizon geometry of @xmath0 d3-branes , where @xmath0 is large and set by the ( small , for reliability ) curvature of the geometry .",
    "the physics of closed type  iib string theory in this background is dual to the physics of @xmath7 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory in four dimensions , with the supersymmetry broken by being at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "the temperature is set by the horizon radius of the schwarzschild black hole , as we will recall below .",
    "we introduce a d7brane probe into the background .",
    "four of the brane s eight world ",
    "volume directions are parallel with those of the d3branes , and three of them wrap an @xmath8 .",
    "the remaining direction lies in the radial direction of the asymptotically ads@xmath2 geometry .",
    "such a d3d7 configuration controls the physics of the @xmath1 gauge theory with a dynamical quark in the fundamental representation@xcite . the configuration ( at zero temperature ) preserves @xmath9 supersymmetry in @xmath10 , and the quark is part of a hypermultiplet .",
    "generically , we will be studying the physics at finite temperature , so supersymmetry will play no explicit role here .",
    "we are studying the d7brane as a probe only , corresponding to taking the @xmath11 limit , and therefore there is no backreaction on the background geometry .",
    "this is roughly analogous to the quenched approximation in lattice qcd .",
    "the quark mass and other flavour physics  such as the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a condensate and the spectrum of mesons that can be constructed from the quarks  are all physics which are therefore invisible in the background geometry .",
    "we will learn nothing new from the background ; our study is of the response of the probe d7branes to the background , and this is where the new physics emerges from .",
    "we carefully study the physics of the probe itself as it moves in the background geometry .",
    "the coordinates of the probe in the background are fields in an effective d7brane world ",
    "volume theory , and the geometry of the background enters as couplings controlling the dynamics of those fields .",
    "one such coupling in the effective model represents the local separation , @xmath12 , of the d7brane probe from the d3branes , where @xmath13 is the radial ads@xmath2schwarzschild coordinate .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic value of the separation between the d3branes and d7brane for large @xmath13 yields the bare quark mass @xmath14 and the condensate vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath15 as follows @xcite @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where in this paper @xmath19 .",
    "( the fundamental string tension is defined as @xmath20 here , and the d7brane tension is @xmath21 . )",
    "the zero temperature behaviour of the d7branes in the geometry is simple .",
    "the d7brane worldvolume actually _ vanishes _ at finite  @xmath13 , corresponding to the part of the brane wrapped on the @xmath5 shrinking to zero size .",
    "the location in @xmath13 where this vanishing happens encodes the mass of the quark , or equivalently , the separation of the probe from the d3branes .",
    "in addition , in the zero temperature background , the only value of @xmath22 allowed is zero , meaning no condensate is allowed to form , as is expected from supersymmetry .",
    "the finite temperature physics introduces an important new feature .",
    "as is standard@xcite , finite temperature is studied by euclideanizing the geometry and identifying the temperature with the period of the time coordinate .",
    "the horizon of the background geometry is the place where that @xmath6 shrinks to zero size .",
    "the d7brane is also wrapped on this @xmath6 , so it can vanish at the horizon , if it has not vanished due to the shrinking of the @xmath5 . for large quark mass",
    "compared to the temperature ( horizon size ) , the @xmath5 shrinking will occur at some finite @xmath23 , and the physics will be similar to the zero temperature situation . however , for small quark mass , the world  volume will vanish due to the shrinking of the @xmath6 corresponding to the d7branes going into the horizon .",
    "this is new physics of the flavour sector .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite explored some of the physics of this situation ( the dependence of the condensate and of the meson mass on the bare quark mass ) , and predicted that a phase transition should occur when the topology of the probe d7brane changes .",
    "however , they were not able to explicitly see this transition because of poor data resolution in the transition region , coming from using uv boundary conditions on the scalar fields on the d7brane world - volume .",
    "the origin of this phase transition , as we shall see , is as follows : the generic behaviour of an allowed solution for @xmath12 as in equation  ( [ eqt : l ] ) , is not enough to determine whether the behaviour corresponds to an @xmath5vanishing d7brane or an @xmath6vanishing d7brane .",
    "the choices of branch of solutions have different values of @xmath22 , generically .",
    "in other words , for a given value of @xmath24 there can be more than one value of @xmath22 .",
    "there are therefore two or more candidate solutions potentially controlling the physics .",
    "the actual physical solution is the one which has the lowest value for the d7brane s free energy .",
    "the key point is that , at a certain value of the mass , the lowest energy solution may suddenly come from a different branch , and , as the corresponding value of the condensate changes discontinuously in moving between branches , we find that the system therefore undergoes a first order phase transition . on the gauge theory side , we can imagine a similar situation occurring ; two different branches of solution are competing , and the lowest energy branch is always picked .",
    "we are able to uncover this physics by doing a careful numerical analysis of the equations of motion for the probe dynamics on the gravity side of the ads / cft correspondence , which goes well beyond that carried out in previous papers . by using ir boundary conditions instead of uv boundary conditions ,",
    "our analysis allows us to obtain vastly more data points , allowing us to complete the picture described above .",
    "in addition , we are able to study the meson spectrum in some detail , and we find that the phase transition also manifests itself as a first order discontinuity in that physics .",
    "we begin by reviewing the physics of the d7brane probe in the ads@xmath2schwarzschild background solution@xcite .",
    "the metric is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a three vector , @xmath27 and the quantity @xmath28 is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the string coupling ( which , with the inverse string tension @xmath31 sets for example , newton s constant ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is related to the mass of the black - hole , @xmath33 .",
    "the temperature of the black hole can be extracted using the standard euclidean continuation and requiring regularity at the horizon . doing this in the metric given by equation  ( [ eqt : our metric ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , by picking the value of @xmath32 , we are choosing at which temperature we are holding the theory .",
    "we choose to embed the d7brane probe transverse to @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in order to study the embeddings with the lowest value of the on  shell action ( and hence the lowest free energy ) , we choose an ansatz of the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the asymptotic separation of the d3 and d7branes is given by @xmath39 . given this particular choice of embedding , the worldvolume of the d7 brane is given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the determinant of the induced metric on the d7brane given by the pull  back of the space ",
    "time metric @xmath42 .",
    "we are interested in two particular cases .",
    "first , there is the case where @xmath13 goes to  @xmath32 , which corresponds to the the d7brane probe falling into the event horizon . in the euclidean section",
    ", this case corresponds to the shrinking of the @xmath6 of periodic time .",
    "this corresponds to what in ref.@xcite were called condensate solutions .",
    "second , there is the case where @xmath35 goes to  @xmath43 , which corresponds to the shrinking of the @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to what were called karch - katz  like solutions in ref .",
    "it is this change in topology ( @xmath6 versus @xmath5 shrinking ) between the different solutions that will correspond to a phase transition .",
    "the classical equation of motion for @xmath44 is : @xmath45 when @xmath13 goes to infinity and the background metric becomes asymptotically ads@xmath46 , the equation of motion reduces to : @xmath47 which has solution : @xmath48 these two terms are exactly the non  normalizable and normalizable terms corresponding to a dimension 3 operator ( @xmath49 ) in the dual field theory with source @xmath24 and vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath22 .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eqt : eqt of motion ] ) numerically using a shooting technique .",
    "shooting from infinity towards the horizon , physical solutions are those that have a finite value at the horizon .",
    "this will only be accomplished for a particular @xmath24 and @xmath22 value from equation ( [ eqt : l ] ) , which would have to be delicately chosen by hand .",
    "therefore , if we instead start from the horizon with a finite solution , it will shoot towards the physical asymptotic solutions we desire . in order to be able to analyze the phase transition between the condensate and karch - katz  like solutions , we shoot from the horizon for the condensate solutions and from @xmath50 for the karch - katz  like solutions .",
    "this technique avoids having to correctly choose the boundary conditions at infinity , which is a sensitive procedure , allowing us to have many more data points to analyze the phase transition .",
    "we impose the boundary condition that , at our starting point ",
    "the horizon , we have : @xmath51 we argue that this is the physical boundary condition to take ; the first is simply a result of taking the limit of @xmath52 in the equation of motion in equation ( [ eqt : eqt of motion ] ) , whereas the second is a result of requiring no conifold singularity as the @xmath5 shrinks to zero size @xcite .",
    "we solve the equation of motion , equation  ( [ eqt : eqt of motion ] ) , numerically using @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "these numerical choices correspond to fixing the temperature and to measuring lengths in units of the radius of the ads space ; the latter condition also means we are choosing a particular relationship between the thooft coupling and the dual quantities : @xmath55 several d7brane embedding solutions are shown in figure  [ fig : solutionsinlandrho ] .",
    "the red ( solid ) lines correspond to karch - katz  like solutions , and the blue ( dashed ) lines correspond to condensate solutions . from each of these solutions",
    ", we can extrapolate the bare quark mass and quark condensate vev .",
    "we plot the @xmath22 values as a function of @xmath24 in figure  [ fig : c vs m ] .",
    "when enlarged , as shown in figure  [ fig : c vs m zoom ] , we find , as anticipated in the introductory remarks , the multi  valuedness in @xmath22 for a given @xmath24 . physics will choose just one answer for @xmath22 .",
    "there is therefore the possibility of a transition from one branch to another as one changes @xmath24 .    in order to determine exactly where the transition takes place",
    ", we have to calculate the free energy of the d7brane . in the semi - classical limit that we are considering ,",
    "the free energy is given by the the on  shell action times @xmath56 .",
    "for our case , this is simply given by @xcite : @xmath57 where here @xmath19 .",
    "we calculate this integral numerically using our solutions for @xmath44 , and we plot the results for the energy in figure  [ fig : energy ] after we regulate the result by subtracting off the energy from the @xmath58 solution .",
    "there is again multivaluedness at the same value of @xmath24 as before , and we zoom in on this neighbourhood in figure  [ fig : energy zoom ] . if one follows the solutions of lowest energy for a given @xmath24 , one can clearly see that there is a crossover from one branch to another as @xmath24 changes .",
    "this was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , we find a first order phase transition at @xmath59 where the condensate s vev jumps discontinuously . this had been deduced on other grounds in ref .",
    "we show where the jump between curves occurs with the dashed green line in figures  [ fig : c vs m zoom ] and  [ fig : energy zoom ] .",
    "we note that the shaded areas in figure  [ fig : c vs m zoom ] are equal ; this is to be expected since @xmath22 and @xmath24 are thermodynamically conjugate to each other , and the area of the graph has the interpretation as a free energy difference @xmath60 .",
    "next we study the meson spectrum .",
    "this can be read off from the physics of the fluctuations in  @xmath35 and @xmath36 about our classical solutions @xmath61 and @xmath62 described above@xcite , corresponding to scalar and pseudo scalar fields respectively in the gauge theory@xcite . as a reminder , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exact meson spectrum for the ads@xmath46 background was found to be given by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 labels the order of the spherical harmonic expansion , and @xmath65 is a positive integer that represents the order of the mode . in our meson spectrum calculations ,",
    "we have only considered the @xmath66 solutions for the fluctuations in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we begin by considering the four  dimensional mass of the meson corresponding to fluctuations in @xmath36 . by considering an ansatz of the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 in terms of our previous coordinates , and by expanding to second order in @xmath69 , we can calculate an equation of motion for @xmath70 . in particular , we find that near the event horizon , the equation of motion becomes : @xmath71 this equation has solutions given by in  falling and out  going waves : @xmath72",
    "this analysis of the quasinormal mode behavior has been shown in refs.@xcite , and the ( correct ) boundary condition of in  falling waves corresponds to the fact that fluctuations about condensate solutions do not allow for mesons with a discrete mass spectrum .",
    "the mesons `` melt '' away into the plasma , from the gauge theory perspective .",
    "however , as was shown in ref.@xcite , we can still find the mass of the meson ( which we shall denote as @xmath73 ) for these fluctuations before they melt , in addition to the meson s lifetime ( @xmath74 ) with the identification : @xmath75 = m \\",
    ", \\quad \\mathrm{im}[\\omega ] =   \\left(2 \\tau \\right)^{-1 } \\ .\\ ] ] the fluctuations about the karch - katz  like solutions have a discrete mass spectrum ; therefore the mesons are stable , and @xmath76 will be purely real . to search for the condensate fluctuations , we do a convenient field redefinition : @xmath77 such that our boundary condition is simply : @xmath78 for the fluctuations about karch - katz  like solutions",
    ", we simply use the boundary conditions : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is sufficiently small .",
    "( we used @xmath81 here . ) in order to find the correct value of  @xmath76 for both sets of fluctuations , we note that in the limit that  @xmath82 approaches zero , where the background becomes asymptotically ads@xmath46 , the field @xmath70 must only be comprised of a normalizable term , _",
    "i.e. , _ the coefficient in front of the non  normalizable term must be zero .",
    "we show the first level of the discrete four  dimensional meson mass dependence on the bare quark mass in figures [ fig : phi meson spectrum 4d ] and [ fig : phi meson spectrum zoom 4d ] ( zoomed ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : phi meson omega ] we show the behavior of the real and imaginary part of @xmath76 . + for large bare quark mass , our solutions match those of the ads@xmath83 case discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( shown as the black lines with long dashes ) .",
    "we note that , for large bare quark mass , the meson mass is bounded from above by the ads@xmath83 mass .",
    "this is to be expected since the coupling in the finite temperature gauge theory goes as : @xmath84 in addition , we see that at zero bare quark mass , the meson has a finite mass .",
    "this is simply the mass gap of the three  dimensional gauge theory : in the euclidean section , the four  dimensional gauge theory is compactified on an @xmath6 , whose radius is set by the energy scale of the theory . in this case , the energy scale is set by the bare quark mass , so at zero bare quark mass , the circle shrinks to zero size , making the gauge theory effectively three  dimensional .",
    "+ for fluctuations in the @xmath35 direction , we can follow a similar analysis as for the fluctuations in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "we begin by searching for the 4dimensional mass by taking an ansatz @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 has the form : @xmath88 the equation of motion shows the same behavior as the @xmath36meson , so we choose the same boundary condition as in equation ( [ eqt : bc1 ] ) for the condensate solutions . for the karch - katz  like solutions",
    ", we use the boundary condition : @xmath89 where @xmath80 is suitably small .",
    "( we chose @xmath81 . )",
    "the spectrum is shown in figures [ fig : theta meson spectrum 4d ] and [ fig : theta meson spectrum zoom 4d ] .",
    "in figure [ fig : theta meson spectrum zoom 4d ] , the disconnect between the condensate and karch - katz  like solutions is due to there being tachyonic modes that extend beyond the zero meson mass @xcite , but we have not shown them in our plots . they occur well away from the physical regime .     + we may also consider fluctuations in the gauge field living on the d7brane ; such fluctuations would correspond to vector mesons in the gauge theory . in order to study their behavior , we must begin by including the field strength term ( from the world ",
    "volume gauge field ) to the dbi action .",
    "the action is given by : @xmath90 \\wedge f \\wedge f \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath91 $ ] is the pull - back of the 4form potential sourced by the @xmath0 d3branes .",
    "our previous solutions assumed a solution @xmath92 , so we will consider quadratic fluctuations about this solution . expanding this action to second order in @xmath93",
    ", we have : @xmath94\\ , \\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath95 run over the world ",
    "volume coordinates and @xmath96 run over the world ",
    "volume coordinates transverse to the d3brane .",
    "we have dropped the first order term since it will just give the classical equation of motion for @xmath93 .",
    "since we are only interested in the components of the gauge field along the d3brane worldvolume , the wess ",
    "zemino term will not contribute to the equations of motion that we are interested in .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion for the quadratic fluctuations is given by : @xmath97 to compute the 4dimensional mass of the vector meson , we consider an ansatz of the form : @xmath98 we want to consider the case where the condition @xmath99 still holds , which requires us to set @xmath100 since we are working in the rest frame of the vector meson .",
    "the equations of motion for the three @xmath101 s are identical , so we only need to solve for one of them .",
    "the equations of motion show the same behavior as the @xmath36mesons , so we follow the same procedure as before with the same boundary conditions as in equations ( [ eqt : bc1 ] ) and ( [ eqt : bc2 ] ) . the spectrum is shown in figures [ fig : vector meson spectrum overall 4d ] and [ fig : vector meson spectrum zoom 4d ] .",
    "we see again that the mass is bounded from above by the ads@xmath83 mass ( shown as the black lines with long dashes ) .",
    "we expect that , while the details of this construction will not persist in a `` realistic '' qcd string dual , the phase transition itself represents strongly coupled dynamics that may well persist as part of the full story of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the transition is exciting in itself , of course ( particularly since its dual involves a change of topology in the d7brane world  volume ) , but much further work is needed on several questions .",
    "for example , the robustness of the phase transition against @xmath102 corrections would be interesting to study",
    ". it would also be interesting to see if the back  reaction can be included , allowing us to study @xmath103 and follow the phase structure to this regime .",
    "although there are complications involving conical deficits in otherwise flat directions when dealing with the back  reacted geometry in the case of a d3d7 system , some progress has been made in studying the back - reacted geometry of other more stable dp ",
    "d(p+4 ) systems @xcite",
    ". however , many of these calculations have not considered black hole or other finite temperature configurations . these , and several other questions , are exciting matters for further study .",
    "this research is supported by the us department of energy . we have benefitted from discussions with robert c. myers and david mateos .",

    "<S> in studying the dynamics of large @xmath0 , @xmath1 gauge theory at finite temperature with fundamental quark flavours in the quenched approximation , we observe a first order phase transition . a quark condensate forms at finite quark mass , and the value of the condensate varies smoothly with the quark mass for generic regions in parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> at a particular value of the quark mass , there is a finite discontinuity in the condensate s vacuum expectation value , corresponding to a first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we study the gauge theory via its string dual formulation using the ads / cft conjecture , the string dual being the near  horizon geometry of @xmath0 d3branes at finite temperature , ads@xmath2schwarzschild@xmath3 , probed by a d7brane . </S>",
    "<S> the d7brane has topology @xmath4 and allowed solutions correspond to either the @xmath5 or the @xmath6 shrinking away in the interior of the geometry . </S>",
