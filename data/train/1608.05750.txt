    "the colors of these faint galaxies in abell 2744 are similar to those of red dwarf galaxies found in the local universe .",

    "the number of these sources in the abell 2744 field is @xmath108 , which is about a half of that in the parallel field , @xmath109 .",
    "thus the number density of these galaxies is higher in the parallel field than in the abell 2744 field .",
    "we checked the images of these blue faint sources , finding that most of them are star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus these blue faint galaxies are probably star - forming galaxies that are located in the outskirts of abell 2744 , falling toward the cluster center .",

    ", we derive @xmath319 from the number density profile of the gc / ucds , which is @xmath466 times steeper than that of the mass density profile .",
    "however , the mass density profile is consistent with that of the radial number density profiles of the red sequence galaxies in the outer region at @xmath316 .",
    "it is noted that , although the spatial distribution of the gc / ucds shows a strong correlation with the mass density map ( see * figure [ fig_mass ] * ) , the gc / ucds show a significant difference in the radial distribution in the sense that the gc / ucds show a much stronger central concentration .",
    "these results show that the radial distribution of the gc / ucds in abell 2744 is much steeper than the distribution of dark matter , which is consistent with the case of abell 1689 @xcite .",
    "the radial distribution of the dwarf galaxies follows well that of dark matter .      since the discovery of ucds",
    ", the origin of the ucds has been controversial @xcite .",
    "there are three types of scenarios suggested to explain the origin of the ucds .",
    "first , the ucds are just the massive end of the normal gcs @xcite .",
    "second , they are the nuclei of dwarf galaxies that were stripped due to the tidal interaction with their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for this scenario has been found recently by detection of the existence of supermassive black hole in some ucds @xcite , and by finding that some ucds show an extended star formation history ( @xcite , ko et al .",
    "( 2016 , in preparation ) ) .",
    "metal - rich ucds with young populations may be the remnants of a dissipative merger of two gas - rich dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "third , the ucds are the remnants of primordial compact galaxies that have formed early around their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "this was suggested to explain the fact that the spatial distribution of the ucds in the fornax cluster show a stronger central concentration than than of the de galaxies .",
    "the origin of the ucds may be a combination of these , rather than a single scenario @xcite .    recently @xcite and @xcite studied the properties of 97 ucds ( with @xmath320 pc , @xmath321 mag , @xmath322 mag ) in m87 , a cd galaxy in virgo , this is the largest sample of ucds in a single galaxy .",
    "they found that there are significant differences in the radial number density profiles and the kinematics between the ucds and the gcs in virgo and that the mean color of the ucds is consistent with that of the blue gcs . from this",
    "they concluded that the origin of most ucds in virgo is close to the nuclei of stripped dwarf galaxies , rather than to the massive end of the gcs .",
    "this conclusion is in strong contrast to the result for the ucds in coma that @xcite concluded , that most ucds in coma are of the star cluster - origin , noting the similarity in the properties and spatial distribution of ucds and gcs .",
    "their sample of ucds covers a similar magnitude range , @xmath323 mag .",
    "in the discussion of compact stellar systems ( with @xmath324 pc and @xmath325 ) in various galaxies and galaxy clusters , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that there are two types of ucds : star cluster - type ucds and galaxy - type ucds .",
    "the upper magnitude limit of star cluster type ucds is @xmath326 mag ( or @xmath327 ) .",
    "they noted that the lf of the ucds and compact galaxies shows a break at @xmath328 mag .",
    "it is almost flat at the bright range ( @xmath329 mag ) , but it increases suddenly at the faint end ( @xmath330 mag ) ( see figure 12 in @xcite ) .",
    "the bright component represents galaxy - origin ucds , while the faint one does star cluster - type ucds .",
    "however , this is based on the sample made of heterogeneous data and the number of the sources brighter than @xmath331 mag is only a handful , as described by @xcite , so that it is only indicative , requiring further confirmation .",
    "the lfs of gc / ucds in abell 2744 in this study ( * figure [ fig_lfpoint ] * ) show a break at f814w @xmath195 mag , which corresponds to @xmath196 ( @xmath332 ) mag .",
    "thus this value is 0.6 magnitude fainter than @xmath326 mag , noted for the ucds in the local universe @xcite .",
    "our result based on the large sample of homogeneous data for abell 2744 confirms the presence of the break , but at a 0.6 magnitude fainter value , @xmath333 mag .",
    "in addition , it is noted that the mean color of the faint dwarf galaxies with @xmath334 mag in abell 2744 is similar to that of the ucds / gcs . in summary , there are three clues useful to understand the origin of the ucds in abell 2744 found in this study : ( a ) the presence of a break at @xmath335 mag in the lf of the ucd / gcs , ( b ) the radial number density profiles of the ucds that are much steeper than those of the red sequence galaxies , and ( c ) the mean color of the faint red sequence galaxies that is similar to that of the ucds .",
    "these clues support the hypothesis for the dual origin of the ucds : bright ucds are the nuclei of dwarf galaxies that were stripped when they passed the inner region of a galaxy cluster , while faint ucds are the upper end of mass functions of the gcs .",
    "we detected a large population of gcs , ucds , and dwarf galaxies in the deep high resolution f814w and f105w images of the sourthern core of abell 2744 in the hff .",
    "we could estimate the background field contribution using photometry of the parallel field and the hxdf .",
    "then we investigated the photometric properties of these sources in comparison with the results for the parallel field and the hxdf . to date , abell 2744 at the redshift of @xmath0 is the most distant system where gcs and ucds are studied in detail .",
    "primary results are summarized as follows .",
    "* cmds of the extended sources derived from deep f814w ( restframe @xmath336 ) and f105w ( restframe @xmath2 ) images of abell 2744 show a red sequence reaching down to @xmath303 mag .",
    "* cmds of the point sources in abell 2744 show a rich population of point sources whose colors are similar to those of typical gcs .",
    "they are as bright as @xmath4f814w@xmath114 ( @xmath337 ) mag , and their color distribution shows a peak at ( f814w - f105w)@xmath122 .",
    "they are mostly bright gcs and ucds in abell 2744 .",
    "* th spatial distribution of the gcs and ucds shows a strong central concentration to the brightest galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the mass map based on gravitational lensing analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the radial number density profile of the gcs and ucds is much steeper than the radial mass density profile based on gravitational lensing models @xcite . the mass density profile is consistent with the radial number density profile of the dwarf galaxies in abell 2744 . *",
    "the lf of the gcs and ucds in abell 2744 shows a break at f814w@xmath195 ( @xmath338 ) mag .",
    "this is consistent with the one based on the heterogeneous data for the ucds in the local universe @xcite .",
    "* the number of ucds with f814w@xmath205 mag in abell 2744 is estimated to be @xmath206 .",
    "the number of gcs is derived to be @xmath207 , this value is even larger than that for abell 1689 , @xmath23 , given by @xcite .",
    "thus abell 2744 hosts the largest number of gcs among the known systems . *",
    "the lf of the red sequence galaxies for a large range of magnitudes @xmath177f814w@xmath102 ( @xmath339 ) mag shows double components , with a dip at f814w @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) mag .",
    "the faint end of the red galaxy lf is fit well by a flat power law with @xmath11 , showing no faint upturn . *",
    "these results support the hypothesis for the dual origin of the ucds : bright ucds are nuclei of dwarf galaxies that were stripped when they passed the inner region of a galaxy cluster , while faint ucds are massive gcs at the upper end in the mass function of the gcs .",
