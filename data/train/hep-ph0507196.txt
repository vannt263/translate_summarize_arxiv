    "perturbative calculations of high - energy processes with widely separated scales often yield large logarithms involving the ratios of the scales , which shall be resummed to all orders to achieve reliable predictions . in processes like deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) ,",
    "drell - yan ( dy ) and the higgs - boson production , multiple hard scales appear in a certain kinematical limit such as threshold production region , and/or when a low transverse momentum of the final states is measured . for the transverse momentum distribution ,",
    "the rigorous theoretical study in qcd started with the classical work on semi - inclusive processes in @xmath0 annihilation by collins and soper in @xcite , where a factorization was proved based on the transverse momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions and fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "the resummation of tmd large logarithms was performed by solving the relevant energy evolution equation .",
    "this approach was later applied to the dy process in @xcite , where a general and systematic analysis of the factorization and resummation were performed .",
    "this latter procedure became known as `` collins - soper - sterman '' ( css ) resummation formalism .",
    "the resummed formulas are used for many processes with the relevant coefficients extracted by comparing between the expansion of the resummed expressions and the fixed - order calculations @xcite .",
    "although the factorization approach is sound and rigorous , it involves often quantities that are not manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "moreover , the physics of the energy evolution does not seem transparent .    in this paper",
    "we pursue the same resummation from a different path .",
    "we exploit the fact that there are ( at least ) two well- separated hard scales which are naturally appropriate for an effective field - theoretic approach to perform the resummation .",
    "the recently proposed `` soft - collinear - effective - theory '' ( scet ) @xcite is useful here .",
    "although it was originally applied for the study of heavy @xmath1 meson decays , it was later generalized to other high - energy processes @xcite .",
    "recently , this effective theory has been used to study the threshold resummation for the dis structure function as @xmath2 in @xcite and for dy @xcite .",
    "the resummation in the effective theory is performed by studying the anomalous dimensions @xmath3 of the effective operators after performing matching between the full and effective theories .",
    "the exponentiated sudakov form factor appears by running down the scale of the matching coefficient from the higher scale @xmath4 down to the lower scale @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a scet study of transverse - momentum dependence for higgs - boson production was initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors work directly in momentum space , and the next - to - leading logarithmic result was deduced from a full qcd calculation .",
    "here we consider the same resummation for the drell - yan process as well as the standard - model higgs production at hadron colliders . instead of working in the momentum space , we use the impact parameter space .",
    "moreover we perform calculations directly in scet .",
    "in general , the resummation formula for these processes can be written in the following form , taking the dy process as an example @xcite , @xmath7 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 represents the born - level cross section for dy production .",
    "the variables used here are standard : @xmath9 is the invariant mass of the dy pair ; @xmath10 is the observed transverse momentum relative to the beam axis ; @xmath11 is the rapidity ; @xmath12 is the center - of - mass energy squared with @xmath13 the momentum of the incoming hadrons .",
    "the variable @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the equivalent parton fractions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 term contains the most singular contributions at small @xmath10 , resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the second term @xmath19 represents the regular part of a fixed - order calculation for the cross section , which becomes important when the transverse momentum @xmath10 is on the order of @xmath20 .",
    "the main result of our study can be summarized by the following formula for the @xmath18 term , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the parton distributions and/or fragmentation functions related to the processes studied , and the notation @xmath24 stands for convolution .",
    "two matching coefficients appear in the above formula : one is @xmath25 connecting between the matrix element of full qcd current and the effective theory analogue at the scale @xmath9 ; the other is the coefficient function @xmath26 obtained by calculating the processes in scet at a lower scale @xmath27 .",
    "the exponential suppression form factor arises from the anomalous dimension of the effective current in scet , @xmath28 the anomalous dimension is identical for dis and dy processes , and depends only on the effective theory operators .",
    "moreover , the same @xmath3 controls the threshold and the low transverse momentum resummations .",
    "the matching coefficient @xmath25 , on the other hand , is process dependent ( but independent of threshold or transverse - momentum resummation ) .",
    "all the large double logarithms are included in the sudakov form factor @xmath29 .    in the main body of the paper ,",
    "we show how to get the above resummation formula using scet . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the resummation for the dy process in scet",
    ". the anomalous dimensions of the effective current are calculated up to two - loop order .",
    "a comparison will be made with the css formalism . in sec .",
    "iii we will briefly discuss the extension of the formalism to the standard - model higgs production .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec . iv .",
    "in soft - collinear effective field theory , we consider drell - yan production with finite transverse momentum @xmath10 in two steps , assuming @xmath30 . in the first step ,",
    "one integrates out all loops with virtuality of order @xmath31 to get an effective theory called scet@xmath32 in which there are only collinear and soft modes .",
    "the collinear modes have virtuality of order @xmath10 . in the second step ,",
    "one integrates out the collinear modes with virtuality @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", the theory is matched onto scet@xmath33 which is just the ordinary qcd without external hard scales .",
    "the soft physics is now included in the parton distribution functions .",
    "let us consider the first step : integrating out modes of virtuality of order @xmath31 . at low @xmath10 ,",
    "the most singular contribution in dy comes from the form - factor type of diagrams , in which the quark and antiquark first radiate soft gluons , followed by an annihilation vertex decorated with loop corrections .",
    "if the gluon radiations are attached to the loops , the soft gluon limit does not give rise to any infrared singularity , and hence diagrams yield higher - order contributions in @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , one needs to consider only the form - factor type of diagrams in studying the virtual corrections . to integrate out the hard modes ( where all gluon momenta are of order @xmath31 see , e.g. , @xcite ) from the theory",
    ", we can match the full qcd current onto the ( gauge invariant ) scet current @xcite and the matching coefficient contains the hard contributions . by exploiting the non - renormalizability of the form factor",
    ", we write down a simple renormalization group equation from which we can extract the anomalous dimension of the effective current .    in the second step ,",
    "we calculate the scet cross section .",
    "one needs to compute only the real contributions since the virtual diagrams are scaleless in the effective theory and vanish in on - shell dimensional regularization ( dr ) . at this stage",
    "the cross section obtained is the same as the one in full qcd taken to the relevant kinematical limit .",
    "this has been established at one - loop order in the threshold resummation for dis and dy @xcite",
    ". this will also be the case for dy in low transverse momentum limit .    resumming the large logarithmic ratios",
    "is performed by considering the scale dependence of the matching coefficient , which is controlled by the anomalous dimension of the effective current . by running down the scale from @xmath4 to the lower scale @xmath35 , all the large logarithms exponentiate and give rise to the sudakov form factor . in the following ,",
    "we will demonstrate how this can be done systematically , providing a powerful tool for future studies .",
    "the basic lagrangian and feynman rules for scet can be found in refs.@xcite . in our calculation",
    ", we choose the two light - like vectors : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the matching is made between the full qcd current @xmath38 and the scet@xmath32 current @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the collinear quark fields in scet , and @xmath41 are the collinear wilson lines .",
    "the collinear wilson lines appear as a requirement of the collinear gauge invariance in the scet@xmath32 lagrangian .",
    "all calculations are performed in feynman gauge and @xmath42 scheme in @xmath43 .",
    "dr is employed to regularize both infrared ( ir ) as well as ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences .      at the scale of @xmath9 , we need to consider only the virtual contributions to the quark form factor both in full qcd and the effective theory .",
    "the full qcd calculation of the quark form factor has so far been done up to two - loop order @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the virtual diagrams in the effective theory are scaleless , and the relevant form factors vanish in dr where the uv and ir divergences cancel out at every order in @xmath44 . since the effective theory captures the ir behavior of the full theory ( and the uv divergences are cancelled in both theories by respective counterterms ) , the matching coefficients for the effective theory operators will be obtained from the finite parts of the full qcd calculation . in the following , we will study the matching coefficients at one- and two - loop orders .    at one - loop order ,",
