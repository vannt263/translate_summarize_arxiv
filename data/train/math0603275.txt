    "further this assignment of knots to numbers for the @xmath169th induction step of the number @xmath513 effectively includes the determination of the distribution of prime numbers in the @xmath169th induction step and is by induction determined by this assignment for the previous @xmath515 induction steps such that the assignment for the previous @xmath515 induction steps is inherited in this assignment for the @xmath169th induction step as the preordering sequences in the determination of this assignment for the @xmath169th induction step .",

    "then when a composite knot which is in repeat is at the position of an intermediate state then this knot is also definitely assigned with this composite number .",
    "it follows that when the chains are completed we have that the ordering of the subsequences of preordering sequences is determined .",
    "then the remaining knots ( which are not at the transition states of the chains ) which are not in repeat are definitely assigned with the number of the positions of these knots in the @xmath169th step .",
    "for these knots the numbers of positions assigned to them are just the number related to them respectively",
    ".    then the remaining knots ( which are not at the transition states of the chains ) which are in repeat must be replaced by new prime knots because of the repeat and that no other knots related with numbers in this @xmath169th step in the generalized preordering sequences can be used to replace the remaining knots .",
    "this means that the numbers of the positions of these remaining knots in repeat are prime numbers in this @xmath169th step .",
    "this is because that if the numbers of the positions assigned to the new prime knot is a composite number then the composite knot related with this composite number is either in a transition state or is not in transition .",
    "if the composite knot is not in transition then the composite number related to this composite knot is just the number assigning to this composite knot and since this number is also assigned to the new prime knot that this is a contradiction .",

    "thus from the preordering sequences we have determined the positions ( i.e. the distribution ) of prime numbers in the @xmath169th step .",
    "now since the preordering sequences are constructed by the previous steps we have shown that the basic structure ( in the sense of above proof ) of this assignment of knots with numbers for the @xmath169th step ( including the determination of the distribution of prime numbers in the @xmath169th step ) is determined by this assignment of knots with numbers for the previous @xmath515 steps . in other words we have that the basic structure of the @xmath169th induction step is determined by the structure of the previous @xmath515 steps .    to complete the proof of this theorem let us show that at each @xmath169th induction step ( @xmath645 ) there are rooms for introducing new composite knots with the @xmath507 operations only and we can determine the ordering of these composite knots with the @xmath507 operations only in each @xmath169th induction step .",

    "we can determine the number of prime knots with minimal number of crossings @xmath698 without using the actual contruction of these prime knots .",
    "we then denote these two prime knots by @xmath542 and @xmath543 respectively and the two composite knots obtained by the @xmath507 operation only by @xmath782 and @xmath783 respectively . similarly at the @xmath545th step",

    "let @xmath794 be a sequence of eigenvalues of @xmath795 : @xmath796    then following the usual approach for contructing green s functions ( @xcite ) we can write the green s function @xmath240 for this sequence of eigenvalues in the following form : @xmath797 where @xmath798 is the energy parameter .",
    "we remark that for each sequence of eigenvalues there is a corresponding green s function .",
    "the most complete green s function of the quantum system is the usual one which includes all the eigenvalues of the energy operator of the quantum system .",
    "we can further generalize the green s function to the form that @xmath798 is a negative parameter with @xmath799 replaced by @xmath800 and then @xmath798 is extended as a complex parameter .",
    "it is a general property of green s functions that the green s function ( [ r2 ] ) gives distributions of wave amplitudes of the corresponding quantum system with the energy operator @xmath795 .    then by letting @xmath164 and taking integration on @xmath36 we have the following form of trace formula @xcite : @xmath801 where we set a normalized condition on the eigenfunctions @xmath802 such that @xmath803 ( for a notation simplicity we omit a trace operation notation @xmath804 on @xmath805 ) .",

    "we shall then get a more explicit form of the trace formula expressed as a sum of the wave amplitutes of quantum knots ( this is analogous to the trace formula of quantum chaos where the periodic orbits are classical while here the periodic orbits are of quantum nature @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "let us then use another approach to find out the wave amplitute of quantum knots ( i.e. periodic orbits ) , as follows .    from the above sections we have the classification table of knots which gives a correspondence of quantum knots and numbers such that the distribution of the quantum prime knots in this correspondence is the same distribution as that of the prime numbers and prime quantum knots are one - to - one corresponded to prime numbers ( we may let the trefoil knot be related to the prime number @xmath0 )",
