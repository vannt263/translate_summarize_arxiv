    "new thermoelectric coolers and power generators are under massive investigation.@xcite these devices are in general even more reliable than commercial heat - exchange refrigerators but their efficiency , in the best cases , is much lower . the quality of the material need in a thermoelectric device is defined by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath2 is expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defzt ] ) in terms of transport coefficients .",
    "currently , the highest value of @xmath0 , which is @xmath3 1 at room temperature , is found in bi - te alloys.@xcite new devices would be competitive with traditional refrigerators if @xmath0 were about 3 @xmath3 4 : the major lack of high-@xmath0 materials is at temperatures below .    in this paper@xcite",
    "we propose a junction of metal and strongly correlated semiconductor as the basis for a possible efficient low - temperature thermoelectric device .",
    "this system embodies previous intuitions that were recognized fruitful@xcite in different materials / devices such as rare - earth compounds , superlattices , and metal / superconductor junctions .",
    "we now outline these concepts and briefly review the related literature .    from the definition @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the absolute thermopower ( seebeck coefficient ) , @xmath6 the electrical conductivity , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 the electronic and lattice part , respectively , of the thermal conductivity",
    ", it follows that an ideal thermoelectric material should have high thermopower , high electrical conductivity , and low thermal conductivity .",
    "semiconductors seemed to have the optimum collection of these properties , in contrast with metals , which have high @xmath6 but low @xmath5 , and insulators , which have high @xmath5 but low @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the last thirty years no substantial enhancement of @xmath0 beyond @xmath3 1 was obtained .",
    "a breakthrough came with the synthesis of new materials such as filled skutterudites , which have nearly bound rare - earth atoms , closed in an atomic cage , whose `` rattling '' under thermal excitation scatters phonons , then dramatically reducing @xmath8.@xcite more generally , heavy atoms in compounds help with lowering @xmath8 .",
    "mahan and sofo@xcite also showed that the best bulk band structure for high @xmath5 is one with a sharp singularity in the density of states very close to the fermi energy .",
    "these results provide the first idea in the search for the best thermoelectric , namely to look at rare - earth compounds as major candidates .",
    "in fact , mixed valence metallic compounds ( e.g.  cepd@xmath9 , ybal@xmath9 ) show high values of @xmath5 , but at the present time no useful value of @xmath0 has been reported.@xcite    the second idea is that the best thermoelectric must have an energy gap . because in ordinary semiconductors the optimum band gap is predicted to be about 10 @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the boltzmann constant),@xcite one",
    "is led to consider small - gap semiconductors for low - temperature applications .",
    "if the chemical composition of semiconductors includes transition metals or rare earths , conduction and valence bands are frequently strongly renormalized by correlation effects , forming a temperature - dependent gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) : this is the case for mixed - valent semiconductors , usually cubic , whose relevant electronic properties may be modeled by a @xmath12-flat band and a broad conduction band , with two electrons per unit cell.@xcite this class of materials consists of two subclasses : the first is the kondo insulator , characterized by very strong coulomb interaction between electrons on the same rare - earth site , usually described by the slave boson solution of the anderson lattice hamiltonian.@xcite mao and bedell predicted a high value of @xmath0 for bulk kondo insulators ( the lower the dimension , the higher the value):@xcite however , some experimental reports seem to exclude this possibility.@xcite the second , called the electronic ferroelectric ( fe),@xcite consists of semiconductors with high dielectric constants , such as smb@xmath13 and sm@xmath14se@xmath9 , and it is modeled by the self - consistent mean - field ( mf ) solution of the falicov - kimball hamiltonian.@xcite the ground state of the insulating phase is found to be a coherent condensate of @xmath15-electron/@xmath12-hole pairs , giving a net built - in macroscopic polarization which breaks the crystal inversion symmetry and makes the material ferroelectric.@xcite    another useful observation is that @xmath0 is reasoned to increase in quantum - well superlattices , due to the modification of the density of states.@xcite moreover , superlattices with large thermal impedance mismatch between layers seem very efficient at reducing @xmath8 because interfaces scatter phonons very effectively.@xcite however , if the transport is parallel to the layers , the parasitic @xmath8 of the bigger gap material@xcite or the tunnelling between conduction layers@xcite can drastically decrease @xmath0 . besides , if intra - layer transport is diffusive and described by bulk parameters , @xmath0 for the whole superlattice can not be higher than the maximum value for the single constituents.@xcite    in addition to the above literature , this work was stimulated by some recent advances in thermoelectric applications of junctions .",
    "nahum and coworkers@xcite built an electronic microrefrigerator based on a metal - insulator - superconductor ( nis ) junction .",
    "subsequent experimental@xcite and theoretical work@xcite confirmed this new idea .",
    "edwards and coworkers@xcite showed that tunneling through structures with sharp energy features in the density of states , like quantum dots and nis junctions , can be used for cryogenic cooling .",
    "it seems then a natural extension to us to study the junction between a metal and a strongly correlated semiconductor .",
    "there were recent proposals for devices such as semiconductor / metal superlattices with transport perpendicular to interfaces .",
    "mahan and woods@xcite suggested a multilayer geometry with the thickness of the metallic layer smaller than the electronic mean free path and the semiconductor acting as a potential barrier ( thermionic refrigeration ) .",
    "independently , moyzhes and nemchinsky@xcite proposed a similar configuration with the metallic layer thickness comparable with the energy relaxation length .",
    "we cite also min and rowe s idea@xcite of using fermi - gas / liquid interfaces . while the analysis of electronic transport of ref .   and",
    "is not applicable to our study , because of the sharp energy profile of the transmission coefficient across the junction which we examine , and of the nature of the correlated semiconductor ground state , this experimental geometry , with the strongly correlated semiconductor replacing the barrier layer , could be implemented , as we suggest at the end of sec .",
    "[ sporcaf ] .    in sum",
    ", we build on two key ideas from the above literature for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "one is to utilize the sharp energy features in the density of states of bulk materials as in strongly correlated semiconductors .",
    "the other is to exploit the good thermoelectric characteristics of a junction . in this paper , we combine these ideas in exploring the thermopower behavior of a junction between a metal and different classes of semiconductors .",
    "we describe the gapped material on one side of the junction as the solution of the falicov - kimball hamiltonian@xcite in different regimes .",
    "in particular , we consider the case of : ( i ) electronic ferroelectric ( fe ) , where , because of the coulomb interaction between @xmath12-holes and @xmath15-electrons , the mf insulating ground state is a condensate of excitons;@xcite",
    "( ii ) narrow band semiconductor ( nb ) , characterized by the @xmath15-@xmath12 band hybridization : it would be a kondo insulator had we take into account the @xmath12-@xmath12 electron repulsion ; ( iii ) broad band semiconductor ( sc ) , for comparison . in these three cases , we solve the electronic motion across the junction by means of a two - band model analogous to the bogoliubov - de gennes equations@xcite in a finite - difference form .",
    "in addition to the clean interface , we consider an `` impurity '' overlayer made either of rare - earth atoms , with relevant atomic orbitals of @xmath12-type , or of atoms with @xmath15-type orbitals , like transition metals . in the latter case",
    ", electrons can hop from these `` @xmath15-impurity '' sites to adjacent neighbor atoms , while in the former @xmath12-impurity case hopping is assumed negligible .",
    "this scenario is motivated by recent advances in atomic layer fabrication .",
    "we compute @xmath0 for the interface via a linear response .",
    "we find that @xmath0 can be greatly enhanced by the presence of a suitable @xmath12-impurity layer at the interface .",
    "in particular , for a fixed working temperature of the junction , an optimum energy of the @xmath12-impurity level exists which maximizes @xmath0 , especially at low temperatures . in these regimes ,",
    "bulk thermal conductivity would be dominated by phonons which would reduce @xmath0 . however",
    ", one can fabricate the junction with two materials with large thermal impedance mismatch , so that phonon scatterings at the interface decrease the thermal conductivity .",
    "thus , phonon conductivity would not diminish the high @xmath0 found . to this aim",
    "we propose an experimental setup , namely perpendicular transport in metal / fe superlattice .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ model ] we describe the model hamiltonian , in sec .",
    "[ gennes ] we solve the electronic motion across the junction , and in sec .  [ trasporto ] we compute transport coefficients and @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ risultati ] we present and discuss our results , for the clean interface ( [ pulita ] ) , and for the @xmath15- ( [ sporcad ] ) and @xmath12- ( [ sporcaf ] ) impurity layer .",
    "also we briefly discuss some structural relaxation effects of the interface ( sec .",

    "our conclusions are in sec .",
    "we introduce the one - dimensional spinless hamiltonian @xmath16 to model the motion across the junction along the @xmath17 direction perpendicular to the interface between a metal and different types of semiconductor .",
    "@xmath16 is given by the sum of three terms : @xmath18    @xmath19 is a tight - binding hamiltonian describing the metal on the left side of the junction : @xmath20 here @xmath21 destroys an electron of charge @xmath22 at the lattice site with energy @xmath23 and position @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the lattice constant , @xmath26 is the hopping parameter for nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath27 is the electrostatic potential across the junction by applying an external bias . in our model , @xmath27 is constant in the two bulk regions with a discontinuous step at the interface , although the actual profile should be determined self - consistently together with the electronic density .",
    "the third term @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : htot ] ) is the falicov - kimball hamiltonian@xcite referring to the insulator on the right side of the interface .",
    "in addition to the coulomb interaction @xmath29 between the @xmath15-electrons at sites @xmath24 and the @xmath12-electrons localized on atoms at @xmath30 , we add a hybridization term ( @xmath31 is the modulus of the hybridization integral ) between @xmath15 and @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "because the crystal has inversion symmetry , this term has to be odd , namely the hybridization term between sites at @xmath32 and @xmath33 and that between sites at @xmath33 and @xmath34 have opposit sign ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hopping coefficient , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the @xmath12- and @xmath15-site energies , respectively .",

    "since the impurity atoms have orbitals differing from those in the bulk , the associated @xmath29 and @xmath31 parameters generally change .",
    "we denote them by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , referring to the couples of sites @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ( fig .",

    "( [ eq : htot ] ) , by means of an approach ( see sec .  [ gennes ] ) analogous to the bogoliubov - de gennes method@xcite ( bdg ) .",

    "following de gennes,@xcite we now write an effective hamiltonian @xmath64 , to be computed self - consistently together with the energy spectrum : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 here we have defined the renormalized energies @xmath68 we shall treat the renormalized quantities @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 as material parameters . for simplicity",

    "we use the bulk hamiltonian @xmath84 : @xmath85 here the index @xmath86 runs over the whole space .",
    "we always assume an electronic occupation of one electron per unit cell ( a cell contains one @xmath15-site and one @xmath12-site ) , namely @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of cells .",

    "our results are that , at room temperature ( @xmath284 0.1@xmath38 , with the usual numerical parameters ) for fe and 1.6 for nb , at @xmath0 is in both cases , at is , and at is .",
    "these extremly high values suggest the possibility of engineering a periodic lattice of @xmath285-layers made of metal and strongly correlated semiconductor to create an efficient thermoelectric device .",
    "borrowing an intuition of refs .   and , the bias applied to the superlattice should be such that the electronic transport occurs perpendicular to interfaces .",
    "the thickness of each layer should be comparable to the electronic mean free path , and large enough to prohibit electrons from tunnelling . in this regime",
    "the electronic motion within each layer is ballistic , and the interfaces can be considered as the only scattering mechanisms .",
    "mahan and woods@xcite call thermionic a similar device with an ordinary semiconductor replacing the strongly correlated one , because the electronic motion is ballistic and the expression for the current is the richardson s equation .",
    "however , here the situation is different , because the transmission coefficient has such a sharp variation with energy that the current has a more complex form than the richardson s expression and it requires a full analysis of the role of the interface in transport .",
    "the idea here is to grow a @xmath12-atom overlayer at @xmath43 with optimal @xmath12-level energy @xmath70 depending on the working temperature of the device .",
    "in addition , we find that the magnitude of thermal conductance changes only slightly with @xmath70 . the @xmath285-layer of rare - earth atoms could also act like an additional source of strong scattering for phonons , thus lowering the lattice thermal conductance.@xcite therefore the junction is a promising candidate as a thermoelectric device .",
    "we briefly comment on the influence which the interface has on the ideal lattice structure .",
    "we consider the narrow band semiconductor nb . if the effect of the surface at @xmath42 is to locally shorten the lattice constant @xmath25 , this will certainly change the hybridization parameter @xmath195 between the @xmath15-site at @xmath42 and the @xmath12-site at @xmath43 . presumably @xmath195 will be increased .",
    "modifying nothing but @xmath195 with respect to the clean interface case , we find that @xmath0 is only slightly affected by this relaxation effect .",
    "in particular , to change @xmath195 up to 10% almost rigidly shifts @xmath274 over the whole temperature range by approximately 10  15 % . from a check of the transmission coefficient , we find that this surface effect represents only a minor perturbation to the electronic transport across the junction .",
    "we have made a qualitative theoretical study of the possibility that a junction of metal and fe or nb ( as opposed to bulk materials or to a junction metal / sc ) produces high thermopower .",
    "this is possible if a @xmath285-layer of suitable rare - earth impurity atoms substitutes the original layer at the interface .",
    "the localized character of the impurity @xmath12-orbital has a strong effect on the transmission of carriers across the junction .",
    "the figure of merit @xmath0 attained is very high , especially at low temperatures .",
    "a realistic device is proposed which exploits the thermoelectric potentialities of the junction .",
