    "the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite , where a pump beam interacts in a non linear crystal and individual photons of the pump decay in a pair of photons , is one of the most reliable sources of photons with predetermined properties@xcite .",
    "in particular , the two photon state may exhibit spatial entanglement @xcite that can be manipulated via the modification of the spatial structure of the pump beam and/or the crystal length . varying them , it is even possible to optimize the coupling efficiency to other optical elements like optical fibers@xcite .",
    "expressions for the main properties of the emission cone and their dependence on the crystal length have been the subject of intense research because of their potential use in the quantum engineering of spdc @xcite . in this work",
    ", we study the spatial properties of the emitted photons via the angular spectrum ( as ) and the conditional angular spectrum ( cas ) . using the exact expressions for the birefringent dispersion relations",
    ", we numerically evaluate these spectra both in the moderate focused and highly focused regimes of a gaussian pump beam .",
    "when reliable approximations for the phase matching function are used , we also obtain simple analytical expressions that reproduce accurately the numerical expectations and reported experimental results ; they allow a better understanding of the effects of the pump beam waist and crystal length in both the as and cas functions .",
    "we also study the usage of these expressions for the optimization of the spdc process in the generation of idler and signal photons localized in predetermined regions of the wave vector space .",
    "to first order in perturbation theory , the spdc state is given by @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the joint amplitude expressed as a function of the frequency @xmath2 and the transversal wave vectors @xmath3 for the signal and idler modes ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "the distribution of the signal / idler photons in the wave vector domain is the angular spectrum ( as ) : @xmath35    the conditional angular spectrum ( cas ) , which is a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , is defined as : @xmath38 this function represents the probability to detect a signal photon with wave vector @xmath39 in coincidence with an idler photon with wave vector @xmath40 . in the paraxial regime ( @xmath41 )",
    "the pump beam can be approximated by a plane wave , and , if we consider a long crystal , the spdc process results in a strict momentum conservation that correlates the observation of an individual signal photon with @xmath42-vector to a single idler photon with a well defined * k*-vector . in experimental situations involving the small but finite transverse dimensions of the pump beam and a usually wide but not so long crystal ,",

    ", @xmath51 , the expression for the cas becomes : @xmath52 @xmath53    the effective width of the gaussian factor that modulates the cas function has two contributions , one due solely to the pump geometry and another highly dependent on the crystal optics and geometry .",

    "the discrepancy is mainly due to the usage of the approximate dispersion relation as described above .",
    "another effect of the crystal is present in the small oscillations in the marginal distribution @xmath73 in fig.[f : cas5](d ) that were lost in the replacement of the phase matching sinc by a gauss function .",

    "it has been shown that spdc with extremely focused gaussian beams in general gives rise to an anisotropic distribution of photon pairs in an emission cone with a mean radius independent of the pump waist , but with a spread that may increase as the pump waist diminishes .",
    "this fact may make difficult the separation of the idler and signal effective modes .",
    "the spdc simulations reported in previous sections were worked out with parameters chosen to optimize a type i spdc process for an ideally incoming plane wave . in this section",
    "we show that parameters like cut angle of the nonlinear crystal or the wavelength of the pump beam can be easily optimized to increase the emission cone radius , preserve approximately the spread of the cone radius and simultaneously preserve the anisotropic localization of the idler and signal wave vectors without a significant loss in the probability of coincidence detection of the emitted photons .    in standard experimental set ",
    "ups , the crystal cut angle is chosen so that an ideal pump beam with an almost plane wave front yields the possibility of creating almost collinear photon pairs with maximum probability . by increasing the cut angle ,",
    "the effective extraordinary refraction index @xmath156 decreases and the mean radius of the emission cone @xmath107 increases .",

    "notice however that @xmath158 also depends on @xmath157 , and we are interested in finding optimal values of @xmath157 that do not increase the width of the emission cone beyond the adequate values for the apertures of usual detecting elements . in most cases ,",
    "the latter include optical fibers to which the signal and idler photons are required to couple .    using the formalism presented in last section ,",
    "the spdc process were roughly simulated and optimal angles were easily found . in fig .",

    "notice that the change in the maximum value of the marginal distributions evaluated at @xmath107 change in less than @xmath173 .",
    "taking into account those results we have performed a complete simulation of the spdc process for the pump beam with @xmath72 m and a cut angle @xmath174 .",
    "the corresponding as and cas are shown in fig .",
    "( [ f : andop2 ] ) .",
    "as predicted from the simulations described in the last paragraph , the spatial resolution of the idler and signal photons has greatly increased while the location where the emitted photons is still concentrated around @xmath175 .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the brightness calculated from the cas function shows that it increases in a @xmath176 for the cut angle @xmath174 compared to @xmath127 . besides the rough estimates for the cone angle and its width given in last paragraph agree approximately with the exact numerical calculation .",
    "we have also studied the possibility of maintaining the original cut angle @xmath127 and optimize the pump wavelength for highly focused gaussian beams . the first calculation using the expression for @xmath107 and @xmath48 give us that changing the pump wavelength from @xmath177 m to @xmath178 m ( @xmath179 m ) yields the same results than changing to @xmath180 ( @xmath174 ) .",

    "they make evident the relevance of the factor @xmath181 , which includes information about the walk off , to understand the general features of these spectra .",
    "notice that under the conditions here studied the cas and the as are independent on the position of the focus plane of the pump beam .",
    "however it could lead to observable effects in other properties of the down converted photons like the purity of state .",
    "the analytical expressions reproduce with high accuracy the predictions of numerical methods that do not make use of the approximations neither on the dispersions relations nor on the phase matching function .",
    "even more important , the results presented here are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements reported in the literature .    having an analytical expression for the cas allows the identification of explicit expressions for the mean traverse radii and the anisotropic width of the emission cone in the wave vector space .",
