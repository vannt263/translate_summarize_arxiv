    "in this work we intend to study the effects of an electric field on the collapse of a massive star .",
    "we perform direct relativistic simulations assuming spherical symmetry and integrating the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we studied the collapse of several stars with different values of the total electric charge and determined the limits at which the collapse is avoided by the effect of the repulsive electric field .",
    "the electric charge is carried by the particles that compose the collapsing fluid . the electromagnetic field and the internal energy of the gas contributes to the total mass - energy of the star , so it is not clear whether it is possible to overcharge a collapsing configuration .",
    "the analysis and conclusions drawn for collapsing charged shells can not be directly extrapolated for this case , and a complete relativistic calculation performed in a self - consistent way is needed to know the outcome of the charged collapse .    in particular , we found the formation of a bubble that was not predicted before .",
    "although its theoretical explanation is quite natural , the formation of the bubble depends on the initial conditions and its evolution is far from obvious due to the non - linearities of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "numerical solutions for the problem of charged stellar collapse were found only recently @xcite , .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the stars are nearly neutrally charged due to a mechanism of selective accretion of charges from the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , if a star is initially positively ( negatively ) charged , accretion of negative ( positive ) charges from the surrounding gas will tend to neutralize the total net charge .",
    "the same reasoning is applied to black holes @xcite .",
    "we observe that the effect of selective accretion were never fully calculated to our knowledge . on the other hand ,",
    "an star can be electrically neutral while possessing a huge internal electric field .",
    "the internal electric field of an astronomical object can be very large in some special scenarios @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , the charge separation inside a spherical compact star , in hydrostatic equilibrium , can be very large when one of the plasma components is a degenerate gas while the other is a maxwell - boltzmann gas , i.e. , like the gas of degenerated electrons and the gas of nuclei in a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper corresponds to the case in which the star posses a net electric charge . however the results can be taken as an approximation to the more complicated problem of an star with total zero charge and with a non zero internal electric field .",
    "we leave this point aside and for clarity we will concentrate here on the dynamics of an star with a total positive charge .",
    "we ask whether an electrically charged star can collapse to form a charged black hole .",
    "would the coulomb repulsion avoid the collapse of the star ?",
    ", and moreover , are there physical differences with the physics of uncharged collapse ? .",
    "moreover , from pure analytic analysis is not clear if it is possible to form an overcharged black hole ( with @xmath3 ) .",
    "the dynamics of a collapsing star could be quite different from the collapse of a charged shell onto an already formed reissner - nordstrm black hole , mainly due to backreaction effects .",
    "in the present paper , we will try to give the answer to these questions .",
    "extremely charged black holes ( @xmath4 ) represent an extreme limit in the context of the cosmic censorship hypothesis , since bodies with charge equal or higher than extremal are undressed by event horizons and constitutes naked singularities @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , the formation of reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes , is in connection with the third law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , because an extreme rn black hole has zero temperature .",
    "so , there is an interest on the formation of charged black holes from a pure theoretical point of view .    in this paper",
    "we are not concerned with the mechanism that produce charge or an internal electric field .",
    "neither magnetic fields nor rotation are taken into account , although they could increase the magnitude of the electric fields .    without loss of generality ,",
    "the density of charge was chosen proportional to the rest mass density .",
    "the interior solutions found can be matched smoothly with the reissner - nordstrm exact solution for the vacuum space - time @xcite . therefore , in the cases in which the star collapses the result is the formation of a reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the problem of charged collapse analyzing the order of magnitude of the physical quantities . in the section iii are described the general relativistic equations that govern the dynamics of the stellar core collapse . in section iv , are described the numerical techniques used to integrate the general relativistic equations and some caveats on its applications .",
    "section v brings a discussion and interpretation of the numerical results . in the subsection",
    "a , we show the calculation of the maximum mass formula for newtonian charged stars , and in subsection b we calculate the optical depth for the neutrinos emitted during the collapse .",
    "we also discuss the implications for core collapse supernova .",
    "we end in section vi presenting some final remarks .",
    "in this section we show some order of magnitude estimates , in order to put in a clear perspective the problem of a self - gravitating charged fluid sphere .",
    "the calculations in the present section are valid only in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "the formation of a charged star , is possible when the gravitational attraction overwhelms the electrostatic repulsion on each single particle of the gas that is collapsing , i.e. , @xmath5 or equivalently @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the charge and mass of the star and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the charge and mass of the particles . in this section",
    "we use a newtonian approach , the full relativistic case could be different .",
    "assume a star that has a total charge to mass ratio @xmath11 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ cargas ] ) any particle with a charge to mass ratio @xmath12 can be added to the star if @xmath13 where the equality gives the maximal charge to mass ratio @xmath14 for example , a proton has a charge to mass ratio . using the eq .",
    "( [ limit1 ] ) the proton can be added to the charged star if @xmath15 thus , a star with higher charge to mass ratio can not be assembled from protons alone . on the other hand , if the infalling particles are dust particles with a larger charge to mass ratio , the maximum limit for the charge to mass ratio of the charged star can be much higher .",
    "an example of this is a self - gravitating ball of fei nucleus , of mass @xmath16 and charge @xmath17 . as the charge to mass",
    "ratio for fei is @xmath18 , the eq .",
    "( [ limit1 ] ) for fe gives @xmath19 and we see that in this case @xmath20 ( greater than for protons alone , see eq .",
    "( [ qmprotons ] ) above ) .    for `` charged dust '' formed by particles with @xmath21 , a self - gravitating sphere with mass @xmath22 and charge @xmath23 , can be in hydrostatic equilibrium if : @xmath24",
    "so : @xmath25 .",
    "let us estimate the amount of charge needed to have an extremely charged @xmath26 star . in this case @xmath27",
    ", so @xmath28 therefore , it is needed to have an excess of @xmath29 in the star , where @xmath30 is the charge of one proton .",
    "there is roughly @xmath31 baryons in a @xmath32 star .",
    "so , there must be one charged particle on @xmath33 neutral ones in order to have a maximally charged compact object .",
    "this is compatible with the limits given above .",
    "therefore , in the extremal case , there are a small charge imbalance equal to : @xmath34 in the star . a tiny amount of charge from a microscopic point of view , but with a huge total sum ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to make the objection that the nucleus would disintegrate , or suffer nuclear fission , before assembling a charged star .",
    "however the energy locally available ( in the center of mass of the particles ) from the collapse is not enough to unbind a nucleus ( bounded by the strong force ) .",
    "this was calculated for a compact charged neutron star .",
    "an exception is a nearly extremal compact object , in this case is energetically favorable for the nucleus to disintegrate @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that we can approach to the formation of a  nearly extreme \" object , although it is not possible to reach the extremal value , the particles will fission first ( see @xcite for details ) .    studying theories with extra dimensions ,",
    "mosquera - cuesta and co - workers @xcite found that particles located in the brane can leak out to the bulk space .",
    "it results that electrons can leak out more easily than baryons , producing a charge asymmetry that can be very large in very old stellar systems .",
    "this is suitable for type ii supernova progenitors and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the mechanism produce a charge imbalance of @xcite : @xmath35 this is several orders of magnitude higher than the needs for producing an extremal star .",

    "near the surface of the star , the pressure gradient term @xmath153 cancels the charge gradient term @xmath154 at a certain point we call @xmath155 . since at this point the two terms cancels out , all the matter outside the layer of coordinate @xmath155 is almost in free fall , producing an accumulation of matter and giving rise to the shell , while at coordinates with @xmath156 the matter is supported by a positive net gradient .",
    "we took care to check that this is not a numerical artifact , changing the boundary conditions at the surface , the amount of charge , and the initial conditions .",
    "hence , it results that the point @xmath155 is roughly the _ locus in quo _ the term @xmath157 and the term @xmath158 sum zero , then the gas is compressed and a shell of matter forms .",
    "the non - linearity in the strong field regime comes from the fact that @xmath77 is a function of the charge and the mass and multiplies the two gradient terms , enhancing the effect ( see eq . [ motion ] ) .    from all the numerical experiments we performed , we observed that the shell formation effect arise more clearly when the initial density profile is flat .",
    "for the case of charged neutron star collapse the effect is negligible @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath155 shift to lower values with time , and this brings the shell to enlarge until @xmath159 , when it reaches the origin and rebounds forming the shock wave mentioned above .",
    "it is observed that the shock do not form in the uncharged case , using the same set of initial conditions .",
    "the density contrast between the shell and its interior is higher for greater total charge ( or equivalently higher internal electric field and zero total charge ) .",
    "this is because the coulomb repulsion inside the shell will be higher , and this gives a higher compression of the matter at the shell . the coulomb repulsion term together with the pure relativistic term @xmath160 in the eq . ( [ motion ] ) , are responsible for the positive mass density gradient near the coordinate origin .",
    "the charged collapse is slightly delayed respect to the uncharged one , i.e.:@xmath161 sec for model 1 respect to the uncharged case that lasts @xmath162 sec . at the end of the simulation",
    ", we observe that the density profile looks globally flatter and the maximum density value is lower than in the uncharged case .    the case 14 in table i is special because it represents stars with a charge greater or equal than the extremal value .",
    "we verified that in this cases the star expands  forever \" , i.e. : we follow its expansion until the density gives a machine underflow . in any of these cases",
    "we expect a re - collapse of the matter : the binding energy per nucleon tends to zero when the charge tends to the mass ( see @xcite ) , and is negative for a charge greater than mass .",
    "for charged stars there must exist a maximum mass limit like for uncharged compact stars .",
    "for white dwarfs the limit is known as chandrasekhar mass limit , while for neutron stars is the oppenheimer - volkoff limit , etc . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the mass limit for newtonian charged compact stars .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , an equation of state dominated by electrons , @xmath163 for a spherical configuration , the newtonian hydrostatic equilibrium gives : @xmath164 simplifying the two equations , for @xmath165 and @xmath166 we get @xmath167 . from this equations ,",
    "we obtain the limiting mass @xmath168 . assuming the charge is a fraction @xmath169 of the mass , i.e. : @xmath170 , @xmath171 which reduces to the known chandrasekhar mass formula when @xmath172 ( no charge ) , modulo some geometric factor depending on the density profile .    for the extreme case @xmath173 , the configuration disperse to infinity .",
    "we checked that this also happens in the relativistic case ( see model 14 of table i ) .",
    "the quantity of energy deposition behind the formed shock wave is critical to produce a successful supernova explosion , like in the proposed mechanisms for core collapse supernovae explosions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the cases we studied the shock wave is not fast enough to reach the surface of the star before the apparent horizon forms ahead of it , and the shock ends trapped by the black hole region .",
    "however , when including neutrino transport in our simulations the shell formation could have a dramatic effect .",
    "this provide a new mechanism for a successful core collapse supernova explosion .",
    "although , the calculations performed in the present work are far from a complete supernova calculation , it is simple to show that in the charged collapse there are a more efficient energy deposition to revive the supernova shock wave .    as the density profile is flatter than in the uncharged case , the neutrino - sphere and gain radius for neutrino deposition must be different . in order to show this , we consider the change in the radius @xmath174 , of the neutrino sphere , which is defined by @xmath175 , where the optical depth of the uncharged matter for the neutrinos is @xcite @xmath176 according to the numerical results presented , we make the approximation @xmath177 , for the charged case , in order to obtain an analytic expression for the optical depth for neutrinos . in this case , the optical depth of the charged matter is @xmath178 it can be seen that @xmath179 .",
    "assuming typical values @xcite : @xmath180 mev and @xmath181 , in the uncharged case the position of the neutrino - sphere is at : @xmath182 km , and in the charged case km , at which @xmath183 , for the particular case @xmath184 . ]",
    "it is : @xmath185 km .",
    "this implies a more efficient neutrino trapping during the charged collapse , and hence a more efficient energy deposition .    [",

    "we have performed relativistic numeric simulations for the collapse of spherical symmetric stars with a polytropic equation of state and possessing a uniform distribution of electric charge .",
    "we have not studied in this paper how the matter acquires a high internal electric field before or during the collapse process .    in the present model we studied the essential features of the collapse of stars with a total electric charge .",
    "the simulations are an approximation to the more realistic problem of the temporal evolution of an star with an strong internal electric field and total charge zero .",
    "this model is under consideration by the authors .    in the cases",
    "were the stars formed an apparent horizon it is unavoidable the formation of a reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "this is guaranteed by the singularity theorems and by the birkhoff theorem .    for low values of the charge to mass ratio @xmath186 , no difference with the collapse of an uncharged star was found .",
    "the value of the total charge that prevent the collapse of the star with any initial condition is given by a charge to mass ratio @xmath1 .",
    "that means that stars with @xmath1 spreads and do not collapse to form black holes nor stars in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "it is observed a dramatically different physical behavior when @xmath187 . in this case , the collapsing matter forms a shell - like structure , or bubble , surrounding an interior region of lower density and charge .",
    "the effect is due to the competence between the coulomb electrostatic repulsion and the attraction of gravity .",
    "this effect must occur in non - relativistic physics as well .",
    "the relativistic case is more interesting due to the non - linearity of the einstein equations .",
    "the effect is more important when lower is the internal energy of the star ( see table i ) . in some of the experiments we observe a blueshift produced at the bouncing shock wave ( see fig . [",
    "fig : a3048 ] ) , because the strong shock wave acquires a positive velocity over a small lapse of time .",
    "for all the cases studied , the density profile is globally flatter than in the uncharged collapse .",
    "the optical depth for neutrinos is much higher in the case of the charged collapse , hence , the neutrino trapping must be more efficient . in conclusion , if the internal electric field increase during the stellar collapse the formation of the shell must be taken seriously in supernova simulations .",
    "in addition , we obtained the mass limit formula for newtonian charged stars , which clearly precludes the formation of naked singularities .",
    "the mass limit can not be naively extrapolated for the relativistic case , because charge and pressure regeneration effects can change the maximum charge to mass ratio . however , in the present work , we checked that it is not possible to form an star from matter with a charge to mass ratio greater or equal than one in agreement with our mass formula and with the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
