    "homophily patterns in networks have important consequences .",
    "for example , citations across literatures can affect whether , and how quickly , ideas developed in one field diffuse into another .",
    "homophily also affects a variety of behaviors and opportunities , with impact on the welfare of individuals connected in social networks . in this paper",
    "we analyze a model that provides new insights into the patterns and emergence of homophily , and we illustrate its implications with an application to a network of scientific citations .    our main objective is to study how homophily patterns behave in an evolving network .",
    "do nodes become more integrated or more segregated as they age ?",
    "how does this evolution depend on the link formation process ?",
    "in particular , does the network become more integrated if new connections are formed at random or if they are formed _ through _ the existing network ?    to answer these questions , we study a stochastic model of network formation in which nodes come in different types and types , in turn , affect the formation of links .",
    "we accomplish this bye introducing individual heterogeneity to the framework of jackson and rogers @xcite , allowing us to focus on the issue of homophily generated through specific biases in link formation .",
    "a new node is born at each time period and forms links with existing nodes .",
    "the newborn node connects to older nodes in two ways .",
    "first , she meets nodes according to a random , but potentially type - biased , process .",
    "second , the newborn node meets neighbors of the randomly met nodes ( friends of friends ) .",
    "this is referred to as the search process and can also reflect type biases . to illustrate ,",
    "consider citation patterns .",
    "typically when writing a new paper , some references are known or found by chance by the authors while others are found _ because _ they are cited in known papers .",
    "biases arise because papers may cite references with greater frequency within their own field .",
    "we examine the long - run properties of this model and the structure of the emerging network .",
    "the biases could arise from agents preferences over the types of their neighbors and/or from biased meeting opportunities that agents face in connecting to each other .",
    "so , in one direction we enrich a growing network model by allowing for types and biases in connections , and in another direction we bypass explicit strategic considerations by studying a process with exogenous behavioral rules .",
    "since in the model search goes through out - links only , strategic considerations are to some extent inherently limited , since a node can not directly increase the probability of being found through its choice of out - neighborhood . while this may not be a good assumption in some contexts , such as business partnerships or job contacts , where search presumably goes both directions along a link , it is appropriate in other contexts , such as scientific citations where the time order of publications strictly determines the direction of search .",
    "we wish to understand the conditions under which the network becomes increasingly integrated  over time .",
    "we consider three different notions of integration . under _ weak integration _ , nodes who are old enough are more likely to get new links than young nodes , independent of types . in this sense",
    ", age eventually overcomes any bias in link probabilities . under _ long - run integration _ , the distribution of types among the neighbors of a given node converges to the population distribution as the node ages .",
    "this is a strong property that requires biases among neighbors to eventually disappear , despite the biased formation process . finally , under _",
    "_  partial integration _ _ , the type distribution among neighbors moves monotonically towards the population distribution as nodes age , although it may maintain some bias in the limit .",
    "these notions capture different , but related , aspects of the idea of network integration .",
    "our main theoretical results are as follows .",
    "first , weak integration is satisfied whenever the probability that a given node is found increases with that node s degree .",
    "this holds in any version of our model where at least some links are formed through search and there is some possibility of connecting across types .",
    "in contrast , long - run integration holds only when search is unbiased .",
    "that is , the random meeting process can incorporate arbitrary biases , but once the initial nodes are met , the new node chooses uniformly from the set of their neighbors , ignoring any further implication of their types .",
    "finally , we show that under a particular condition on the biases , the process evolves monotonically and satisfies partial integration . in particular , the biases in nodes  links generally decrease with age .",
    "to understand where this tendency towards integration comes from , consider unbiased search .",
    "observe first that as a node ages , the proportion of his links obtained through search approaches unity , since the number of neighbors grows with age while the probability to be found at random decreases with population size .",
    "next , note that unbiased search does _ not _ imply an absence of bias among the neighbors of randomly met nodes . due to homophily ,",
    "randomly met nodes are relatively more connected with nodes of their own types . a critical fact",
    "our analysis uncovers , however , is that bias among neighbors neighbors tends to be lower than among direct neighbors .",
    "this is because some nodes of other types are found at random and these nodes are relatively more connected to nodes like themselves .",
    "so the set of neighbors  neighbors has a more neutral composition than the neighborhoods of same - type nodes .",
    "network - based search increases the diversity of connections and , conversely , nodes found through search are being found by a more diverse set of nodes . and",
    "since search plays a larger role with age , older nodes are less biased in their connections . in order to analyze network structure in more detail",
    "we consider a special , but natural , two - type specification of the model where random meetings are organized through a geographic or social space .",
    "nodes of a given type are more likely to reside in a given location and random meetings take place without further bias in the various locations . in this model , biases in random meetings are inherently tied in a precise way to the type - distribution of the population .",
    "this feature allows us to obtain a number of further results .",
    "in particular , we derive an explicit formula relating a node s local homophily among neighbors to its age or degree .",
    "this illustrates our general results and further shows how partial and long - run integration are affected by changes in types  shares .",
    "we also study two important structural properties of the resulting network that are less tractable in the general model :  degree distributions and group - level homophily .",
    "we show how to modify the existing analysis of degree distributions to account for individual heterogeneity and homophily , obtaining new insights .",
    "in addition , we obtain results on group - level homophily consistent with empirical results presented in @xcite .",
    "we find that relative group size has an important impact on how meeting biases map into aggregate properties of the network .",
    "in particular , relative homophily in the network is strongest when groups have equal size , and vanishes as the groups take increasingly unequal sizes . turning to degree distributions",
    ", we find that the majority and minority groups have different patterns of interactions .",
    "in particular , for the minority group , links from their own group are on the one hand rarer due to a size effect , but on the other hand a homophilic bias pulls in the other direction , creating a tension in the overall distribution of links .",
    "however a striking result that is , in principle , testable is that the distribution of total in - links is identical for the groups independent of their relative sizes .    moving from the theoretical analysis",
    ", we illustrate the implications of the model using data on scientific citations in journals of the american physical society ( aps ) published between 1985 and 2003 .",
    "we find that the proportion of citations that a paper obtains from other papers in its own field decreases as the paper ages and becomes more cited .",
    "the observed citation patterns provide some evidence of the partial integration property and are at least partly consistent search follows a less biased ( possibly unbiased ) pattern in the citation process . in studying this application",
    "we are motivated by two factors .",
    "first , patterns of scientific citations have important welfare consequences as they affect the diffusion of knowledge , with impacts on different research fields .",
    "previous research , such as @xcite , generalizing popular concepts such as the _ recursive impact factor _ , stress that the importance of a citation relies on the paths that it allows in the network of citations .",
    "we complement this argument by considering under which conditions citations are likely to bridge scientific production across different communities .",
    "second , scientific citations possess all the features of the network formation process that we study : nodes ( papers ) appear in chronological order and never die , they link directionally to previously born nodes , they have types ( scientific classifications ) , and they find citations both directly and though search among the citations of other papers .",
    "more generally , our study contributes to a growing literature in economics and other disciplines studying the causes and consequences of homophily in social networks .",
    "@xcite study a matching process of friendship formation .",
    "they document several empirical patterns of homophily and explain them through a combination of biases with respect to choice and chance . by design , all individuals have the same degree and age has little impact .",
    "in contrast , differences in age and degree are central to our analysis .",
    "@xcite incorporates homophily into the random graph model of @xcite . again by design , homophily is not affected by degree or age in this approach .",
    "thus , our study and these two papers study homophily patterns in networks from complementary perspectives .",
    "in particular , we provide the first study of how homophily patterns change over time and of the relation between homophily and a node s degree .",
    "this study also advances the analysis of stochastic models of network formation .",
    "earlier work has made great progress in explaining structural network features such as small diameter , high clustering and fat tails in degree distributions , see @xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies assume homogeneous agents and neglect homophily . with respect to this literature",
    ",  we develop and study one of the first stochastic model of network formation incorporating individual heterogeneity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] presents the model with bias only in the random meeting process .",
    "section [ model_bias_only_random ] includes the main result about long - run integration in this setting .",
    "section sec_location_bias studies the special case of two - types and location based bias . section [ sec_model_biased_search ] studies the integration properties of the model when biases appear also in the search part of the meeting process .",
    "section [ sec_citations ] contains the empirical application to citation data .",
    "in our model , nodes are born with randomly assigned types and enter sequentially , meeting existing nodes upon entry .",
    "meetings result in ( directed ) links .",
    "meetings take place through two distinct processes , which we refer to as _",
    "random _ and _ search_. the meeting processes depend on the types of the nodes involved . in this section ,",
    "we study the impact of type - based biases on the random meeting process .",
    "time is indexed by @xmath0 . in each period a new node is born .",
    "we index nodes by their birth dates , so that node @xmath1 is born in period @xmath1 .",
    "nodes have `` types , '' with a generic type denoted @xmath2 belonging to a finite set @xmath3 ( with cardinality @xmath4 ) .",
    "a newborn s type is randomly drawn according to the time invariant probability distribution @xmath5 ( so that types are i.i.d . , across time ) .",
    "a newborn node sends @xmath6 ( directed ) links to the nodes that were born in previous periods . of these @xmath7 links ,",
    "a fraction @xmath8 selects nodes according to a type - dependent _ random _ process ; is an integer in the underlying process , but allowed to be arbitrary in the mean - field continuous - time approximation we analyze . ]",
    "these nodes are called parents .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath9 selects nodes among the neighbors of the @xmath10 parents that have been found via the random process ; we refer to this second part of the process as search .",
    "nodes in a sequence , each connected to all predecessors . ] we define @xmath11 to be the ratio of the number of links formed by the random process to the number of links formed by the search process .",
    "looking first at the random part of the process , we denote by @xmath12 the probability that a link sent by a node of type @xmath13 reaches a node of type @xmath14 . among nodes of type @xmath14",
    ", the link is formed uniformly at random , so there is no further discrimination in this part of the process . if the random meeting process were unbiased , the probability @xmath15 would equal the share @xmath16 of @xmath14 agents in the system .",
    "when @xmath17 we say that there is bias .",
    "this can be interpreted in different ways .",
    "one can view the bias as a reduced form for preferences that nodes have over the type of connections they form .",
    "the case of homophilistic  preferences for type @xmath13 is then captured by a situation in which @xmath18 .",
    "the bias could also arise from constraints in the meeting process , or from spatial differentiation , as in the location model that we will analyze in section [ sec_location_bias ] .",
    "turning now to the search part of the process , the way in which friends are drawn from parents neighborhoods may be , in principle , either biased or unbiased .",
    "much of the paper will study a process with biases only in the random part , so that in the search part , links are formed according to a uniform distribution on the set of parents neighbors .",
    "this assumption has natural interpretations and various applications .",
    "it applies , for instance , to cases where agents face a bias in meeting strangers , but then get to meet the `` friends '' of their new friends without bias .",
    "when the original bias in meetings comes from biased opportunities , this seems to be a natural assumption ; when the bias originates in preferences , it may still be the case that this bias tends to vanish when meetings are mediated by friends . in section [ sec_location_bias ]",
    "we will explicitly analyze a model that relates these biases to location  based differences in the meeting process . when search is itself biased , so that the additional @xmath19 nodes are found among parents neighbors using a type - dependent probability distribution , two types of biases are naturally defined : a bias that discriminates according to the types of the parents through which search is made , and a bias that discriminates according to the types of the parents neighbors . which type of bias is more appropriate depends on the instance of network one has in mind , and leads to formally different models of link formation . in section [ sec_model_biased_search ]",
    "we study the case of biased search and its consequences for integration .",
    "before formally deriving the dynamics of the various processes , in the next section we propose three notions of integration that measure the extent to which the bias in the random and/or search process translates into biases in the long run type - patterns of link formation .",
    "the definitions we provide capture different aspects of integration , focusing on how a node s type - pattern of connections evolves with age , and whether it gets progressively more ( or less ) integrated with the rest of the network .",
    "it is important to note that there are two different aspects of integration : the evolution of newborns newly formed links ( out - links ) and the evolution of older nodes incoming links .",
    "these will exhibit different dynamics . given the bias in the random part of the network formation process",
    ", it is clear that there will always be some bias in the out - links of newborn nodes .",
    "the main questions with regard to the out - links thus pertain to how the links formed by search behave over time , and this is related to the question of how the in - links of older nodes behave .",
    "all three notions of integration discussed here pertain to the behavior of in - degrees of nodes .",
    "out - degree dynamics are studied in sections sec_out_degree and [ sec_formulas_agg ] .",
    "our first notion requires , in particular , that old enough nodes are found by newborn nodes with higher probability than younger nodes , independently of the types of the nodes involved .",
    "[ weak]the network formation process satisfies the * weak integration property * if for every @xmath20 , there exists @xmath21 such that , for all @xmath22 and for all @xmath23 , the node born at time @xmath24 has a lower probability than node @xmath25 to receive a link from a node of type @xmath2 born at time @xmath26 .",
    "note that this form of integration requires that an old enough node of type @xmath2 ends up receiving a link from a newborn node of type @xmath27 with a higher probability than a young enough node of the same type @xmath28 as the newborn .",
    "so , even if link formation probabilities are biased in favor of similar nodes ( homophily ) , old enough nodes are found more often even when of a different type than the newborn .",
    "this form of integration is rather weak , and does not bear implications on the type - composition of any given node s in - degree .",
    "our second notion of integration requires that as nodes age , their local neighborhood grows to represent more and more the type composition of the population .",
    "it is therefore a `` monotonicity '' property , requiring that integration , here defined in terms of how close the composition of neighbors types is to what would obtain in the unbiased case , grows with age .",
    "[ partial ] the network formation process satisfies the * partial integration property * if for every node @xmath20 the fraction of each type @xmath2 in the in - degree of @xmath20 is weakly closer to @xmath2 s population share at time @xmath24 than at time @xmath1 , for @xmath29 , and strictly closer for some types .",
    "so , under partial integration , the in - neighbors of an agent become more and more representative of the overall population as time elapses .",
    "our final notion of integration is stronger and requires that nodes eventually attract in - links according to population shares .",
    "[ longrun ] the network formation process satisfies the * long - run integration property * if for every node @xmath20 the proportion of each type @xmath2 in the in - degree of @xmath20 converges to @xmath2 s population share as node @xmath20 ages .    in other words , in the long run",
    "any surviving difference in the proportion of links received by old nodes from different types is due only to the distribution of types in the population , and the biases in link - formation have no consequences for eventual in - degree patterns .",
    "a benchmark model to study long run integration properties of link formation is one where only the random part of the process is biased , and no further bias is present in the search part of the process .",
    "more precisely , the search process is unbiased in the sense that additional ties are found through a uniform sample among parents neighbors , but remains indirectly biased through the bias that the random process has induced on the type composition of the parents neighborhoods .",
    "this model allows for a clear understanding of the mechanics that lead to integration , and why and when integration may fail .",
    "we study a continuous time approximation of the model , using the techniques of mean - field theory .",
    "this provides approximations and limiting expressions of the process that ignore starting conditions and other short - term fluctuations that can be important in shaping finite versions of the model , and so the results must be viewed with the standard cautions that accompany such approximations and limit analysis .",
    "we consider the expected change in the discrete stochastic process as the deterministic differential of a continuous time process .",
    "let us first look at the probability that node @xmath30 is found by newborn node @xmath31 .",
    "this depends on the shape of the network that has formed up to time @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it depends on the type - profile of in - neighbors of @xmath30 at time @xmath1 , and on the bias of the newborn node towards such types . since search is not type - biased , each link that agent @xmath31 forms through search",
    "is drawn from a uniform distribution over the set of all neighbors of all parent nodes that agent @xmath31 has found at random .",
    "letting @xmath32 denote the probability that a node born in period @xmath30 of type @xmath33 receives a link from a node of type @xmath34 born at time @xmath35 , the following expression is a mean - field approximation of the overall linking probability : @xmath36    the first term on the right  hand side captures the probability of node @xmath30 being found at random .",
    "the probability that node @xmath31 is of type @xmath2 and links at random to a node of type @xmath33 is @xmath37 .",
    "this is divided by the number of nodes of type @xmath33 at time @xmath1 which , under a mean - field approximation , is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "it is then multiplied by the number of links formed at random , @xmath10 .",
    "the second term is the probability of node @xmath30 being found through search .",
    "it is given by the number of search links ( @xmath19 ) formed by the node born at @xmath31 , times the sum , over all possible types @xmath28 , of the probabilities that @xmath30 is found through a node of type @xmath28 . for each possible type @xmath28",
    ", this probability is given by the joint probability of the following events ( corresponding to the four terms in the first summation over types ) : ( @xmath39 ) the newborn node is of type @xmath13 ; ( @xmath40 ) it forms a link with a @xmath28-type node ; ( @xmath41 ) the @xmath28-type node has linked to @xmath30 since @xmath30 was born ; from @xmath28 agents up to time @xmath1 as numerator , and the total number of @xmath28 nodes in the system at time @xmath1 as denominator ] ( @xmath42 ) among the @xmath7 neighbors of this @xmath28-type node , that exactly @xmath30 is found .",
    "it is useful to express the terms of the above formula in a compact way . for all @xmath2 , @xmath28",
    "we write @xmath43 note that the ratio @xmath44 in the above expression is a measure of the bias that type @xmath2 applies to type @xmath28 , so that when this ratio is @xmath45 there is no bias , while when it is greater ( less ) than @xmath45 there is a positive ( negative ) bias of type @xmath2 towards type @xmath28 . in the case of no bias , @xmath46 is simply the probability of birth of a type @xmath2 node , and @xmath47 is @xmath7 times the joint probability that the newborn node is of type @xmath2 and that node @xmath30 is found by drawing uniformly at random from a population of @xmath1 nodes .",
    "we can decompose the matrix @xmath48 as the product of two matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath49 may be seen as a transition matrix of a markov process ( a markov matrix ) , we derive some general results on markov matrices that will be useful in [ proofs ] , where we prove our propositions . ] and @xmath50 is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal is a probability vector : @xmath51 with @xmath52 using the matrix @xmath48 , equation ( [ 5 ] ) becomes : @xmath53 where @xmath54 expresses the expected in - degree , type by type , after time @xmath1 for a node born at time @xmath20 .",
    "we define @xmath55 with a continuous approximation : @xmath56 we study equation ( [ 6 ] ) in terms of ordinary differential equations in matrix form : @xmath57 with the initial condition @xmath58    from now on we will always assume that @xmath48 is invertible ( so that the specification of types is not redundant ) . with this assumption , the unique solutions to these differential equations are the following : @xmath59 where a constant to the power of a matrix is defined as follows : @xmath60      let us test the various notions of integration on this model with unbiased search .",
    "it is clear that the model with @xmath61 can not satisfy weak integration .",
    "we show instead that whenever there is some degree of search ( @xmath62 ) weak integration is satisfied .",
    "in fact , in section sec_model_biased_search we strengthen this result to show that weak integration is still satisfied when search is biased as well .",
    "[ prop_1 ] if @xmath62 , the model with unbiased search satisfies the _ weak integration property_.    the proof ( which appears , along with the proofs of our other results , in [ proofs ] ) shows that the weak integration property is not specific to the unbiased search model .",
    "indeed , various models in which the in - degree of a node determines the probability of being found by a newborn node in a sufficiently increasing manner would give the same result .",
    "moreover , search is not needed for this type of dependence to take place . another model with type - biasedpreferential attachment in which the probability of receiving a link is positively correlated with a node s in - degree , and which exhibits the same weak integration property ,",
    "is discussed in the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "partial and long - run integration are , again , not satisfied when @xmath61 .",
    "the next propositions show that , otherwise , the long  run integration property is always satisfied by the model , while the partial integration property needs an additional assumption .",
    "if @xmath62 , the model with unbiased search satisfies the _ long  run integration property_. [ prop_lri ]    partial integration , instead , occurs under an additional condition .",
    "consider a markov matrix @xmath63 . as formally stated in [ matrices",
    "] , writing @xmath64 , we say that @xmath63 satisfies the _ monotone convergence property _",
    "if , for every pair @xmath65 , and for every @xmath66 , the element @xmath67 satisfies :    1 .   if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 ; 2 .   if @xmath70 , then @xmath71 .",
    "the monotone convergence property captures the idea that transition probabilities are monotone over time .",
    "even with a strictly positive transition matrix , this condition does impose additional restrictions .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to find general or even necessary conditions for monotone convergence of markov matrices .",
    "we then have the following result .",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath49 satisfies the monotone convergence property , then the model with unbiased search satisfies the _ partial integration property_. [ prop_partial_no_bias ]    let us focus on the intuition behind the long run integration property of the model with unbiased search . to fix ideas , let us examine the case in which random probabilities have a homophilous bias .",
    "a given node can be found by a newborn node of a different type via search in different ways : one is that the newborn finds a neighbor of the given node that is of the same type as the newborn , and another is that the newborn finds a neighbor of the given node that is of the same type as the given node .",
    "the first way is relatively more likely given the homophilous bias in the random part of link formation , but the fact that this can also occur via the second route leads this process to be less biased over time .",
    "once the process has become less biased , it even easier to be found by nodes of other types , and so the neighborhood becomes even less biased , and this trend reinforces itself leading to an unbiased process in the limit .",
    "to summarize , as a node ages it becomes more of a `` hub '' , attracting many links from all types in the search process .",
    "this property , that also underlies the weak integration property , together with unbiased search further decreases the bias in the in - degree of hubs . as a result ,",
    "the type composition of new connections becomes even less biased for these hubs , and eventually the bias is eliminated .",
    "the way in which an individual s neighborhood composition limits to the population frequencies as it ages is non - trivial . notice that if a particular individual became connected to a large proportion of others over time , then his neighborhood would necessarily approximate population frequencies .",
    "however , we emphasize that in our model , even though an individual s degree grows without bound , the proportion of others to whom he is connected still vanishes over time , so this effect is not what drives integration .",
    "this happens because the entry rate of new individuals is constant , while the probability for existing individuals to acquire a new link in any given period goes to zero .",
    "finally , we remark that , while the neighorhood of every node approaches a composition that reflects the aggregate population frequencies , it converges to that distribution from a point that is affected by biases in the link formation process .",
    "since those links are perpetually being formed and are subject to biases , the system never approaches a network that has unbiased link patterns .",
    "rather , it is always the oldest nodes in the system that have the least biased neighborhoods .",
    "in fact , one way to see the persistent bias is to focus on out - degree rather than in - degree .",
    "thus , we turn now to analyzing links by tracking where they originate .",
    "so far we have mostly focused on the dynamics of agents in - degree .",
    "of course , out- and in - degree dynamics are intimately related , as the search part of young nodes out - degree will consist predominantly of old nodes , with respect to whom the search part of the process is both directly and indirectly unbiased ( see section [ sec_formulas_agg ] ) .",
    "here we take a close look at the composition of out - degrees and how they evolve over time .",
    "this is of interest not only to better understand integration , but also to shed light on the evolution of homophily , that is , the tendency to form ties with agents of the same type .",
    "we first look at the steady state composition of the out - degree .",
    "let us denote by @xmath72 the proportion of links that originate from a node of type @xmath39 born at time @xmath1 that are directed towards nodes of type @xmath30 .",
    "the evolution of these proportions is given by :    @xmath73    the out  degree depends on the random part ( first term ) and on the search part ( second term ) through the average out  degree of existing nodes . in matrix form",
    ", this is written as follows :    @xmath74    to get a feeling for the limit of this process , it is useful to examine the steady state @xmath75 of this system .",
    "the steady - state is such that the out - degree of each type remains unchanged in time :    @xmath76    [ prop_outdegree ] if @xmath77 , then the steady state equation ( steady_state_outdegree ) has a unique solution @xmath78 , and the system in ( [ out_degree_diff_eq ] ) converges to @xmath78 .    for @xmath77 ,",
    "the second term approaches the null matrix as @xmath79 .",
    "as long as the matrix @xmath80 is more biased than the steady state @xmath81 ( which is true for @xmath80=@xmath49 ) , the bias in excess of the steady state decreases with time , vanishing in the long run ( see also [ matrices ] ) .",
    "this means that the biases in the out - links formed by agents decrease over time , consistent with the homogenization of the search process and the in - degree of older nodes which are dominating the search part of the process .",
    "however , unlike the case of the in - degree of old nodes , full homogenization does not occur even in the limit , since the random part of the out - degree formation does not vanish over time .",
    "in this section we consider a specific form of bias in random meetings , and restrict the analysis to two types for simplicity . by making explicit how the bias in random meetings is generated , we accomplish two goals . first , we generate a closed form expression that describes the integration of individuals as they age .",
    "this formula allows us to study in more detail the integration process , and provides parameters which can be empirically estimated .",
    "second , we obtain additional results on other features of the network , specifically on aggregate homophily at the group level and in - degree distributions that are type - sensitive . for each of these categories of results , the location - based nature of the meeting biases",
    "allows us to study the impact of changes in population frequencies on the structure and properties of the emerging networks .",
    "nodes belong to one of two types : @xmath82 and @xmath83 . with an abuse of notation ,",
    "wee let @xmath84 and @xmath85 in this section .",

    "] once assigned to a location , each agent meets @xmath93 nodes uniformly at random among all individuals present at this location .",
    "thus , it is simply the resulting composition of types in the two locations that permits any type - dependent biases in the model .",
    "we maintain the assumption that the search part of the process is unbiased .    at any time @xmath1 ,",
    "the expected number of @xmath82 nodes at @xmath86 is @xmath94 , while the expected number of @xmath83 nodes in @xmath86 is @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the proportion of @xmath82 nodes in @xmath86 is @xmath96 while the proportion of @xmath82 nodes in @xmath87 is @xmath97 .",
    "the probability that a node of type @xmath82 links at random to a node of the same type is thus : @xmath98 and @xmath99 is obtained by symmetry exchanging @xmath5 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the model generates a simple explicit relation between population frequencies and random meeting biases , controlled by the parameter @xmath92 .",
    "note that when @xmath101 , locations are independent of types and there is no bias :  @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath103 random meetings are biased towards own group and @xmath104 . at the extreme",
    "when @xmath105 , locations are perfectly correlated with types and individuals meet others only from their own group so that @xmath106 .",
    "this allows us to derive a number of comparative statics results with respect to population frequencies below .",
    "using the expressions above we have @xmath107    we note that proposition [ prop_partial_no_bias ] ( together with lemma matrix_2x2 in [ matrices ] ) implies that if @xmath62 , then the location  based model always satisfies the _ partial integration property _ , because @xmath108 and @xmath109",

    "this allows us to illustrate the results from the previous section and to obtain further predictions on the shape of integration . in particular , we find that the amplitude of integration tends to be lower in larger groups .",
    "we denote an individual s in  degree by @xmath112 , which is a function of the node s entry date @xmath20 and the individual s age .",

    "thus , consistent with the general long - run integration result of proposition [ prop_lri ] , @xmath113 converges to the population frequency @xmath118 as @xmath112 and , hence , time , diverge .",
    "the convergence is monotonic , and so satisfies the property of partial - integration described in proposition 3 .",
    "notice that by application of lemma d in appendix a , one could demonstrate partial integration without the explicit solution contained in proposition [ prop3 ] .",
    "however , the formula delivered by proposition [ prop3 ] allows us to derive some further implications .",
    "first , the relation between @xmath113 and in  degree is convex , so its decrease with age takes place at a decreasing rate .",
    "second , and perhaps more importantly , the relation between @xmath113 and degree tends to be flatter in larger groups ; the difference in integration between low - degree and high - degree nodes is smaller in larger groups .",
    "third , this function could be readily fitted to data . in contexts where information on how links are formed is lacking",
    ", this could provide the basis of an empirical analysis of the model .",
    "this approach is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "we turn now to a more detailed discussion of the distribution of links across nodes in the network .",
    "proposition [ prop3 ] makes explicit the relationship between the degree of an individual and the local composition of its in  neighbors , demonstrating , in particular , the properties of partial and long - run integration .",
    "integrating that relationship in order to obtain a measure of group - level homophily requires knowing the distribution of in - degree across individuals .",
    "this section is concerned precisely with analyzing those degree distributions , which have become a cornerstone of social network analysis .",
    "even with only two groups , capturing the distribution of links becomes substantially more complex , relative to the one - group case , as nodes can connect to both same- and different - type nodes , and one wants to keep track of the different kinds and sources of links . in this context",
    ", we can keep track of _ seven _ different degree distributions rather than one .",
    "define @xmath119 as the distribution of the in - degrees of type @xmath89 nodes paying attention only to links coming from nodes of type @xmath33 , @xmath120 .",
    "then @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the standard in - degree distributions of @xmath82 and @xmath83 nodes ( ignoring the types of neighbors ) , and finally @xmath123 is the total in - degree distribution of the entire society .    we observe that as a consequence of lemma [ l1 ] , all of the degree distributions have a power - law upper tail , as has been documented extensively in empirical contexts , starting from @xcite .",
    "further , we are able to make predictions about how the distribution of links from own- and other - group nodes relate to each other , making clear the importance of whether a node is in the majority or minority group .",
    "finally , we show that changing the bias in location - based meetings causes the distributions to shift in the sense of first order stochastic dominance ( proposition [ prop3 ] ) .    to begin the analysis consider , for example , @xmath121 .",
    "observe that @xmath124 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary time period and , by definition , @xmath20 is the node that has in - degree @xmath112 at time @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath20 can be solved for under the mean - field approximation .",
    "this defines @xmath121 implicitly as a function of @xmath112 , and an analogous method works for the other distributions . while these equations do not usually yield closed - form solutions",
    ", they still allow us to derive important properties of the degree distributions .",
    "our first such result orders the degree distributions as the number of out - links is varied .",
    "we first ask how @xmath125 and @xmath126 compare to each other .",
    "that is , we focus on one group @xmath89 , and for those nodes we compare the ( distributions of ) the number of links coming from the the own group and the other group .",
    "we find that the relationship depends on the size of group @xmath39 .",
    "[ 3part prop ] fix @xmath127 so that the majority group is group 1 .",

    "\\(iv ) @xmath134    these results express the interplay of two effects . on the one hand",
    ", there is a direct size effect through which nodes receive more links from the larger group . on the other hand , homophily leads nodes to receive relatively more links from nodes of the same group . in the larger group ,",
    "both effects are aligned which implies that @xmath128 fosd @xmath129 . in the smaller group , however , these effects pull in opposite directions .",
    "the third item in the proposition says that if homophily is not too large , the size effect dominates and @xmath132 fosd @xmath131 .",
    "the condition in part ( iii ) requires that @xmath135 , and hence @xmath92 , be lower than or equal to some threshold value .",
    ", from lemma [ l1 ] , the threshold can be written @xmath136 . ]",
    "we can see that this threshold is increasing in @xmath5 . as the size of the larger group increases ,",
    "the size effect becomes relatively more important and @xmath132 ends up dominating @xmath131 for a larger range of the parameters .",
    "in contrast , the second item says that even if homophily is large , as long as it is not perfect ( @xmath130 ) , the homophily effect can not dominate the size effect .",
    "the explanation lies with nodes of high degree .",
    "we can show that , in the upper tail , @xmath131 always lies above @xmath132 . in other words ,",
    "the size effect dominates for the hubs of the smaller group , and they tend to get relatively more connections from nodes of the larger group .",
    "this is related to partial integration : the largest degree nodes are more integrated with respect to their in - degree .",
    "in other words , the hubs in the minority group have the greatest proportion of their in - neighbors from the majority group .",
    "the last part provides a particular empirical prediction , as independent of the homophily biases , the relative group sizes , and the proportion of links formed through the random meeting process , the in - degree distributions of the two groups must be identical .",
    "the final result in this section describes how the distributions of inter- and intra - group links respond to changes in the meeting bias .",
    "[ prop_fosd ] assume biases are location - driven .",
    "fix @xmath137 and @xmath138 and take @xmath139 .",
    "let @xmath119 be the distributions corresponding to @xmath92 and let @xmath140 be the distributions corresponding to @xmath141 , for @xmath120 . then @xmath142 and @xmath143 strictly fosd @xmath128 and @xmath131 , while @xmath132 and @xmath129 strictly fosd @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "when the meeting bias increases , no matter the group sizes , individuals tend to form more links within their own groups , and fewer links across groups .",
    "this section complements the general analysis of section [ sec_out_degree ] with a detailed inspection of the steady state out - degree composition in the two type location based model . in this specific context , our aim is to understand how the built - in homophily in random meetings translates into biased long run proportions of out - links that stay within a group , and how these proportions relate to groups frequencies .",
    "proposition [ prop5 ] below tells us that group - level homophily is strongest when the groups have nearly equal sizes , and vanishes at the extreme when one group dominates society .",
    "further , corollary [ coroll_shift ] tells us that , for given population frequencies , group - level homophily is stronger when the bias in random meetings or the relative prevalence of random meetings is higher .    in preparation for this result , define the homophily index @xmath146 as the expected proportion of the links formed by a new @xmath89 node that are with same - type nodes . at the steady state ,",
    "@xmath147 and @xmath148 satisfy the following equation @xmath149,\\ ] ] as well as its symmetric counterpart .",
    "we know from the results of section [ sec_out_degree ] that the steady state solution will be greater than @xmath150 , as the bias in out - links does not vanish with time , since the random meeting process always constitutes a non - trivial portion of out - degree .",
    "this equation decomposes the expected number of links formed within group as the sum of two terms capturing links formed at random and links formed through search . at random ,",
    "this number is by definition proportional to the probability @xmath151 . through search , there are two ways to connect within the group , depending on whether the intermediary node is of the same type or not . solving these equations yields , for type @xmath82 , @xmath152 recalling that @xmath153 represents the ratio of the number of links formed at random to the number of links formed through search . combining this expression with equation ( [ b1 gm ] ) , we obtain an explicit formula linking group homophily and population frequencies , controlled by the ratio of random to search meetings @xmath138 and the bias parameter @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , we can see that @xmath146 is increasing in @xmath138 .",
    "as @xmath138 tends to zero and search dominates the network s formation , @xmath146 tends to @xmath154 , while when @xmath138 becomes large and random meetings dominate , @xmath146 tends to @xmath155 .",
    "this means that the larger the role of search in the network formation process , the more integrated the society becomes , consistent with the intuition obtained from the general setting .",
    "this provides an expression at the group - level of the idea that search tends to reduce the imposed bias in meetings .",
    "the reason for this is that nodes found through search are more likely to be of the other type than nodes found at random , due to the possibility that the intermediary node is of the other type .",
    "as search dominates , homophily disappears completely and links are formed according to population frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "when the random meeting process dominates , links are formed according to the probabilities determined by the location - based meetings .    to analyze how group - level homophily varies with group size",
    ", we find it useful to look at a normalized index introduced by @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "define _ relative homophily _ ( or _ imbreeding homophily _ ) as follows @xmath156 relative homophily is positive when a group forms a higher proportion of its links within the group than would be implied by the population sizes , and is normalized to have a maximal value at unity .",
    "again , from the results of section [ sec_out_degree ] , relative homophily will be positive in steady state .",
    "however , we can now demonstrate a more detailed relationship between relative homophily and relative group size .",
    "the following result shows how relative homophily changes as the composition of society varies .",
    "[ prop5 ] @xmath157 is symmetric around @xmath158 .",
    "it is equal to zero at @xmath159 and @xmath45 ; it increases from @xmath159 to @xmath158 , and decreases from @xmath158 to @xmath160 , and is concave .",
    "thus , in the extreme cases where one group dominates society , relative homophily disappears .",
    "natural mixing occurring at each location tends to homogenize meetings , and this effect overcomes the impact of location biases when sizes are asymmetric . in all other cases , however , relative homophily is positive , and is strongest for intermediate size groups , reaching a maximum when the groups have equal size .",
    "interestingly , the equilibrium mixing model of @xcite generates an analogous result through a different analysis , and this prediction is supported empirically looking at racial composition in the addhealth data .",
    "the next result shows how relative homophily responds to changes in the meeting process .",
    "[ coroll_shift ] @xmath161 is shifted up by an increase in @xmath138 or by an increase in @xmath92 .",
    "that is , for a given society and homophily biases , decreasing the role of search - based meetings increases relative homophily .",
    "this results from the  dampening effect  of search - based meetings on network homophily .",
    "the more prevalent are search - based meetings in the formation process , the lower homophily will be , as  friends of friends  are less likely to be of the same type than are individuals met through the biased random meetings .",
    "finally , increasing the location bias , all else equal , increases relative homophily for any value of @xmath138 , since this is the parameter that controls the extent to which random meetings are exogenously biased .",
    "we now allow for the search part of the process to be biased as well as the random part .",
    "we do this for two main reasons .",
    "first , we want to assess what degree of integration is still compatible with this more flexible specification of biases in the network formation process .",
    "second , the more realistic assumption of some form of bias also in the search process is needed to match the empirical patterns of scientific citations that we study in the final section of this paper .    to prepare for this more general version of the model ,",
    "remember that in the analysis of section [ model_bias_only_random ] , the random bias affects the choice of parents that are used to find the additional @xmath19 search connections . in general ,",
    "the bias that affects the search process may differ from , and possibly be a reinforcement of , the bias induced by the random process .",
    "this additional bias is described via an @xmath162 matrix where each element is positive and of the form @xmath163 .",
    "a value of @xmath45 indicates no additional bias , while a value greater ( less ) than @xmath45 indicates a positive ( negative ) search bias of type @xmath13 towards type @xmath14 .",
    "this is the distortion in the relative probabilities with which type @xmath13 searches the out - neighborhoods of its parent nodes .",
    "the mean - field approximation of the process is described by @xmath164    the product @xmath165 in ( [ rtb3 ] ) describes the probability applied by type @xmath2 to the selection of random nodes in search of type @xmath33 .",
    "note that the bias is independent of both time variables @xmath30 and @xmath1 , and of the type @xmath33 of the target . in matrix form ,",
    "the system becomes : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the _ hadamard product _ : @xmath168 .    from the decomposition given in equation ( [ 15 ] ) , it follows that @xmath169 where the biases are such that @xmath170 is still a markov matrix .",
    "the model with unbiased search , analyzed in previous sections , is a special case of this model , where the matrix @xmath171 is a matrix of all @xmath45 s .",
    "as we will see , weak integration still holds in the presence of biased search .",
    "moreover , while long - run integration generically does not hold , partial integration occurs under an additional monotonicity condition . in this case , while the distortions in type frequencies among an individual s neighbors decrease over time , they do not vanish as the node accumulates links .",
    "[ prop - g1 ] if @xmath62 , the general model with biased search satisfies the _ weak integration property , _ generically does not satisfy _ long - run integration _ , and satisfies the _ partial integration property _ provided that @xmath170 satisfies monotone convergence .",
    "in this section we use our random - search model to study the patterns of cross - subfield scientific citations in physics .",
    "the use of scientific citation data is motivated by several factors .",
    "first , there is a literature that shows that key aspects of the time evolution of citations can be captured by models based on variations of a preferential attachment mechanism .",
    "@xcite , and then @xcite for isi papers and also @xcite , found that older papers enjoy an advantage in receiving citations , independently of the intrinsic quality of the paper .",
    "although a bias in favor of recent papers allows for a better fit of certain datasets ( see @xcite ) , the evidence of a rich - gets - richer mechanism seems sound .",
    "in addition , refs . @xcite have shown that this evidence can be accounted for when preferential attachment is generated by a random - search mechanism as the one we use in this paper , where authors first `` randomly '' ( from the econometrician s perspective ) select papers , and search these papers reference lists to find additional citations .",
    "there is less exploration of the patterns of citations across disciplines or across other types of categories in which research may be organized .",
    "several works have shown that geographical distance and national boundaries are two important determinants of citation patterns , while @xcite has shown that citation patterns are quite uniform across sub - fields in the high energy physics dataset ( spires ) . also , @xcite finds a relationship between the homophily in citing other papers and the total citations received by computer science papers .",
    "thus , the generative process of citations is consistent with basic aspects of the network formation process studied in this paper : first , it is a growing network process , since papers appear in chronological order , and old papers do not exit or die .",
    "second , citations are directional , and only citations from newer to older nodes are possible .",
    "third , citations can not disappear , and accumulate over time .",
    "in addition , and specifically to our model , nodes have `` types '' , that we identify with the scientific classification of a paper ( see below for details ) .",
    "finally , a key element of our process is that links are formed both at random and by search through established links . in the case of citations ,",
    "these two channels of search are present , since there is a difference between citations that come from direct knowledge of a paper and citations that originate from the list of references of other papers that one has read .",
    "we use the american physical society ( aps ) citations dataset , which reports papers published in journals of the aps between 1/1/1985 and 12/31/2003 .",
    "there is a total of 207912 papers and 1488866 citations ( roughly 7 citations per paper on average ) .",
    "around @xmath172 percent of the papers are never cited , while the most cited one receives @xmath173 citations .",
    "types are defined by the first digit of the first ( out of at most four ) pacs classification code that characterize each paper :    * 00 : general ; * 10 : the physics of elementary particles and fields ; * 20 : nuclear physics ; * 30 : atomic and molecular physics ; * 40 : electromagnetism , optics , acoustics , heat transfer , classical mechanics , fluid dynamics ; * 50 : physics of gases , plasmas , and electric discharges ; * 60 : condensed matter : structural , mechanical , and thermal properties ; * 70 : condensed matter : electronic structure , electrical , magnetic , and optical properties ; * 80 : interdisciplinary physics and related areas of science and technology ; * 90 : geophysics , astronomy , and astrophysics .",
    "we first note that the time profiles of types population shares , measured , for each type and for each year , as the proportion of the total papers published during that year that are of that given type , is fairly stationary during the whole period ( see figure [ shares ] ) .",
    "the approximate stationarity of most categories is roughly in line with our assumption in the theoretical model that probabilities of birth of various types are time invariant .",
    "there are additional dramatic ( unexplained ) changes in the composition of fields following 2003 , and so we truncate our data at that point .        in order to identify the various elements of our theoretical model , we need to distinguish citations that originate from a direct random draw from the pool of all existing papers ( `` random '' citations ) from those that originate from a search process that goes through the references contained in one s random citations ( `` search '' citations ) .",
    "to do this , we proceed as follows .",
    "we first identify a citation from paper a to paper c as a `` search '' citation if there exists some paper b with the following properties : 1 ) b is published after c and before a , 2 ) a cites b , and 3 ) b cites c.    this method obviously has some degree of arbitrariness and will not perfectly identify how the authors found the papers they cite .",
    "the bias of this simplification is however not clear . on one side",
    ", it overstates the weight of `` search '' in the citation process , since a may well cite c because c is an important paper in the field , the reason for which also b also cites c , without a having known about c though b. on the other side , however , it could be that authors of paper a know about paper c only because they came across paper b , which cites c : they could decide to cite only c because it contains an older version of the same idea .",
    "that is , it can be that some papers are found through the search process , without the authors ever citing the intermediate paper , and so some citations are coded as random even though they were found through search .",
    "we stick with the strict interpretation of the model , given that we have no other way of identifying the actual process that the authors followed ( see @xcite for an interesting strategy of identification ) .    using this method",
    "we identify @xmath174 percent of total citations as `` search '' citations .",
    "we then classify the remaining @xmath175 percent of citations as `` random '' citations , being the complement of the `` search '' citations .      in order to identify the bias in the random part of the process",
    ", we compare the share of `` random '' out - citations that are of the same type of the citing paper with the population share of the type of the citing paper . the first share ( @xmath176 in table [ table_random ] )",
    "is obtained by averaging the share of random same - type out - citations of all papers of a given type during the whole time period . the second share ( @xmath177 in table table_random )",
    "is obtained as the share of papers of a given type over all papers in the sample for the whole time period .",
    ".same - type bias in the overall citations . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe that for all sub - fields except type 00 , type 50 and type 90 , citations of higher order are less likely to come from papers within the same field .",
    "this is true also in the aggregate if we compute the expected change in probability without keeping track of the specific field of the receiving paper .",
    "types 00 and 50 behave differently and have an increase in the probability of homophilous citations , while type 90 has no significant change in probability . at least broadly , this is consistent with partial integration . on average",
    ", the probability of being cited by papers of the same field decreases by @xmath178% : on average , the share of in - field citations decreases by 2.5 percentage points between the first and the 100th in - citation .    beyond testing partial integration",

    "there is an evident upward trend , consistent with the model s predictions .",
    "this paper contributes to our understanding of how heterogeneity and homophily among individuals impact the networks that they form .",
    "we have built on the framework of jackson and rogers ( 2007 ) , in which links result both from meeting others at random and through introductions to their neighbors , allowing both of these channels for link formation to be biased by the types of the nodes involved .",
    "some applications of interest have significant type - based biases .",
    "scholars are more likely to read papers from their own field , people are more likely to befriend those with a similar background , organizations have closer ties within departments , and so on .",
    "we do not attempt here to model the source of these biases , but take the model as a reduced form representation of the resulting effects that such biases have on how links are formed .    within the context of this framework , long - run integration ,",
    "whereby old nodes obtain local networks that asymptotically resemble the population at large , occurs if and only if the search part of the network formation process ( the second channel mentioned above ) is type - unbiased so that the only bias in the process comes in which nodes are initially found through the random meeting process .",
    "understanding the neighborhoods of old nodes is important since these nodes constitute the hubs of the network .",
    "if one is interested in processes occurring on the network such as , e.g. , strategic behavior or diffusion processes , then the characteristics of hub nodes are of central importance .",
    "on the other hand , there are many other important properties of the network that may be affected by type - based biases . in order to analyze these properties",
    ", we turned to the more specific model of location - based biases among two groups , deriving implications regarding type - based degree distributions and on group - level homophily .",
    "we leave open a number of interesting questions .",
    "first , there is the matter of exploring the extent to which the results from the location - based biases generalize .",
    "second , there are other kinds of network formation processes in which similar questions could be addressed .",
    "in fact , in the different model of @xcite , there are some similar results , but in general we have an incomplete understanding of how heterogeneity impacts network formation .",
