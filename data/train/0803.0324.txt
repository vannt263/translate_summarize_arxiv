    "over the last @xmath620  years , several significant milestones have been reached in the pre - explosion detection of core - collapse supernova progenitors .",
    "these began with the `` peculiar '' type  ii - p supernova 1987a in the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. , menzies et al .",
    "1987 ) , where a cataloged @xmath7  @xmath8 blue supergiant star was identified as the progenitor ( sk @xmath969 202 ; e.g. , west et al .",
    "1987 ) . next came the transition type  iib 1993j in m81 , with a progenitor identified as a red supergiant in a binary system ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al . 1993 ; maund et al .",
    "2004 ) . during the last decade",
    ", analyses of pre - explosion archival optical imaging of nearby galaxies obtained ( mainly ) with the _ hubble space telescope _ have convincingly shown red supergiants with masses @xmath10  @xmath8 to be the typical progenitors of type  ii - p supernovae ( e.g. , smartt et al . 2004 ; li et al . 2007 ) , the most common core - collapse supernovae .",
    "curiously , the progenitors of nearby type  ib / c supernovae , thought to result from very massive ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ) stars with strong winds that end their lives as wolf - rayet stars , have evaded optical detection ( e.g. , crockett et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the rarest and most diverse class of core - collapse supernovae are the type  iin ( schlegel 1990 ) , which represent @xmath13 of all type  ii supernovae ( e.g. , capellaro et al . 1997 ) .",
    "their optical spectra , dominated by balmer lines in emission , and slowly declining light curves show clear signatures of interactions between the supernova ejecta and a dense , hydrogen - rich circumstellar medium ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) . mainly due to their low frequencies , high mass loss rates , and the massive circumstellar envelopes generally required to explain the observations ,",
    "some luminous type  iin supernovae have been associated with the deaths of the most massive stars ( e.g. , gal - yam et al .",
    "2007 ; smith 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , evidence for this association has increased with the report of a very luminous source in pre - explosion images of the type  iin sn  2005gl ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2007 ) and the discovery of an lbv eruption two years before the explosion of sn  2006jc ( pastorello et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand",
    ", some low luminosity type  iin have been associated with the super - outbursts of lbvs like @xmath5 carinae ( e.g. , van dyk et al . 2000 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the appearance of the type  iin sn  2008s in the nearby galaxy ngc  6946 ( @xmath14  mpc ; sahu et al .",
    "2006 ) was fortuitous , since a massive stellar progenitor would be relatively easy to find .",
    "however , pre - explosion images serendipitously obtained from the large binocular telescope revealed nothing at the position of sn  2008s , allowing us to put stringent limits on the optical emission . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the discovery of an infrared point source coincident with the site of sn  2008s using archival _ spitzer _ space telescope data .",
    "the _ spitzer _ mid - ir detection , and deep optical non - detections , of the progenitor are the tell - tale signs of a @xmath4  m@xmath3 star obscured by dust .",
    "we describe the available data in   [ sec : data ] , our analysis in   [ sec : shroud ] , and our conclusions in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "ngc  6946 is quite a remarkable galaxy , giving birth to ( at least ) nine sne in the last century .",
    "the latest event discovered in ngc  6946 is sn  2008s , found on february 1.79 ut at @xmath15  mag ( arbour & boles 2008 ) and located 52@xmath16  west and 196@xmath16  south of the nucleus of ngc  6946 .",
    "it was spectroscopically classified as a likely young type  iin supernova from the presence of narrow balmer lines in emission , highly reddened by internal extinction with a measured na  d absorption equivalent width of 5    ( stanishev et al .",
    "steele et al . (",
    "2008 ) later reported that it had a peculiar spectrum due to the presence of narrow emission lines from the [ ca  ii ]  730  nm doublet , ca  ii infrared triplet , and many weak fe  ii features .",
    "the spectral properties and low peak luminosity led steele et al .",
    "( 2008 ) propose that sn  2008s was a _ supernova impostor _ such as sn  1997bs ( van dyk et al . 2000 ) .",
    "accurate coordinates are needed in order to search for the progenitor in pre - explosion images . fortunately , _ swift _ started monitoring sn  2008s with uvot and xrt shortly after the discovery .",
    "we retrieved the uvot @xmath17 optical images obtained on feb .",

    "we estimate the total extinction for @xmath112 to be @xmath113  mag from the observed color @xmath114  mag and assuming a typical intrinsic temperature of @xmath115  k at this early phase of the evolution .",

    "although the light from the supernova likely destroyed the dust that obscured the progenitor to significantly beyond the blackbody scale of @xmath119  au , the existence of internal extinction in the supernova light curve implies a more tenuous dusty obscuring medium on larger scales .",
    "in fact , the rare detection of the [ ca ii ]  730  nm doublet in emission by steele et al . ( 2008 ) may provide direct , and independent , evidence for a significant amount of dust in the csm that was destroyed by the uv - optical flash ( e.g. , shields et al .",
