    "confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking are two crucial features of qcd , although they correspond to different energy scales @xcite .",
    "confinement is an explanation of the physics phenomenon that color charged particles are not observed ; the quarks are confined with other quarks by the strong interaction to form bound states so that the net color is neutral .",
    "however , there is no analytic proof that qcd should be color confining and the reasons for quark confinement may be somewhat complicated . there exist different suggestions about the origin of confinement , some dating back to the early eighties ( e.g. , @xcite ) and some more recent based on the wilson loop techniques @xcite , string theory quantized in higher dimensions @xcite , and lattice monte carlo simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , etc .",
    "it may be supposed that the confinement is not obligatory connected with the strong - coupling regime , but it may be induced by the nontrivial background fields .",
    "one of the earliest suggestion in this direction is the analytic confinement ( ac ) based on the assumption that the qcd vacuum is realized by the self - dual vacuum gluon fields which are stable versus local quantum fluctuations and related to the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this vacuum gluon field could serve as the true minimum of the qcd effective potential @xcite .",
    "particularly , it has been shown that the vacuum of the quark - gluon system has the minimum at the nonzero self - dual homogenous background field with constant strength and the quark and gluon propagators in the background gluon field represent entire analytic functions on the complex momentum plan @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , direct use of these propagators for low - energy particle physics problems encounters complex formulae and cumbersome calculations .",
    "we are far from understanding how qcd works at longer distances .",
    "the well - established conventional perturbation theory can not be used at low energy , where the most interesting and novel behavior is expected @xcite .",
    "the calculations of hadron mass characteristics on the level of experimental data precision still remain among the unsolved problems in qcd due to some technical and conceptual difficulties related with the color confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . in such a case , it is useful to investigate the corresponding low - energy effective theories instead of tackling the fundamental theory itself .",
    "although lattice gauge theories are the way to describe effects in the strong - coupling regime , other methods can be applied for some problems not yet feasible with lattice techniques .",
    "so data interpretations and calculations of hadron characteristics are frequently carried out with the help of phenomenological models .",
    "different nonperturbative approaches have been proposed to deal with the long distance properties of qcd , such as chiral perturbation theory @xcite , qcd sum rule @xcite , heavy quark effective theory @xcite , etc . along outstanding advantages",
    "these approaches have obvious shortcomings .",
    "particularly , rigorous lattice qcd simulations @xcite suffer from lattice artifacts and uncertainties and can not yet give a reliable result in the low - energy hadronization region .",
    "the coupled schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) is a continuum method without ir and uv cutoffs and describes successfully the qcd vacuum and the long distance properties of strong interactions such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , an infinite series of equations requires to make truncations which are gauge dependent .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) is an important tool for studying the relativistic two - particle bound state problem in a field theory framework @xcite .",
    "the bs amplitude in minkowski space is singular and therefore , it is usually solved in euclidean space to find the binding energy .",
    "the solution of the bse allows to obtain useful information about the understructure of the hadrons and thus serves a powerful test for the quark theory of the mesons .",
    "numerical calculations indicate that the ladder bse with phenomenological potential models can give satisfactory results ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it represents a certain interest to combine the ac conception and the bse method within a phenomenological model and to investigate some low - energy physics problems by using the path - integral approach .",
    "particularly , it is shown that a `` toy '' model of interacting scalar `` quarks '' and `` gluons '' with ac could result in qualitatively reasonable description of the two- and three - particle bound states @xcite and obtained analytic solutions to the ladder bse lead to the regge behaviors of meson spectra @xcite .",
    "below we consider a more realistic model introduced in @xcite by taking into account the spin , color and flavor degrees of constituents .",
    "this model was further modified in @xcite , applied to leptonic decay constants in @xcite , and used to simultaneously compute meson masses and estimate the mass of the lowest - lying glueball in @xcite . here",
    "the aim is to collect all necessary formulae , explain the method in detail , and show that the correct symmetry structure of the quark - gluon interaction in the confinement region reflected in simple forms of the quark and gluon propagators can result in quantitatively reasonable estimates of physical characteristics in low - energy particle physics . in doing so",
    ", we build a model describing hadrons as relativistic bound states of quarks and gluons and calculate with reasonable accuracy the hadron important characteristics such as the lowest glueball mass , mass spectra of conventional mesons , and the decay constants of light mesons .",

    "the formation of a two - gluon bound state , the analytic expression for the lowest glueball mass and its numerical value are represented in sec .",
    "because of the complexity of qcd , it is often prudent to examine simpler systems exhibiting similar characteristics first . consider a simple relativistic quantum - field model of quark - gluon interaction assuming that the ac takes place . the model lagrangian reads @xcite : @xmath3^{ab}q^b_f",

    "the path integrals defining the leading - order contributions to the two - quark and two - gluon bound states read : @xmath19    the green s functions in qcd are tightly connected to confinement and are ingredients for hadron phenomenology .",
    "the structure of the qcd vacuum is not well established and one may encounter difficulties by defining the explicit quark and gluon propagator at the confinement scale . obviously , the conventional dirac and klein - gordon forms of the propagators can not adequately describe confined quarks and gluons in the hadronization region .",
    "any widely accepted and rigorous analytic solutions to these propagators are still missing . besides , the currents and vertices used to describe the connection of quarks ( and gluons ) within hadrons can not be purely local . and , the matrix elements of hadron processes are integrated characteristics of the propagators and vertices .",

    "we calculate the lowest nonvanishing gluon condensate in the leading - order ( ladder ) approximation : @xmath206 which is the same order of magnitude with the reference value @xcite @xmath207    in conclusion , the suggested model in its simple form is far from real qcd .",
    "however , our aim is to demonstrate that global properties of the lowest glueball state and conventional mesons may be explained in a simple way in the framework of a simple relativistic quantum - field model of quark - gluon interaction based on analytic confinement .",
    "our guess about the symmetry structure of the quark - gluon interaction in the confinement region has been tested and the use of simple forms of propagators has resulted in quantitatively reasonable estimates in different sectors of the low - energy particle physics . the consideration can be extended to other problems in hadron physics .",
