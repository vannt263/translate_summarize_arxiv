    "while -at the dmft level- the numerical effort for computing the optical conductivity @xmath130 is comparable to that for computing spectral functions , as vertex corrections can be usually neglected@xcite , rough approximations have been always done in evaluating the optical dipole matrix elements in the localized ( nmto , wannier , etc .. ) orbital basis . in particular , in the first lda+dmft calculations of @xmath130 for v@xmath1o@xmath0 @xcite the dipole matrix elements were simply replaced by @xmath137 , while in later works@xcite the dipole matrix elements have been evaluated in the peierls approximation , including the effects of multiple atoms in the unit cell when necessary@xcite .",
    "our results for v@xmath1o@xmath0 are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1 ] , where we show in the first row lda ( left ) and lda+dmft ( right ) calculations for the optical conductivity obtained by using the optical matrix elements , while in the second row the corresponding calculations made with the pa are discussed  ( we use @xmath138 , @xmath139 as lattice parameters , see ref .",
    "paperi and references therein ) . in all cases",
    ", we also directly compare our theoretical results with the experimental data reported in ref .",
    "our analysis at the level of the optical conductivity clearly confirms the pivotal role played by electronic correlations in the physics of v@xmath1o@xmath0 : the lda results show a much stronger drude peak ( almost an order of magnitude stronger ) when compared to the experiments .",
    "the inclusion of correlations via dmft significantly improves the situation : due to the proximity to the mott - hubbard mit one observes a marked spectral weight shifts from the drude peak to higher frequencies , which makes the overall agreement with experiment much better in the region up to @xmath140ev , where the experimental data are available .    from our analysis ,",
    "moreover , another important aspect emerges : in the case of v@xmath1o@xmath0 the pa ( adopted in previous calculations , e.g. lupi2010 ) works satisfactorily well , at least in the low - energy @xmath18 subspace : the improvements due to the inclusion of the full optical matrix elements only leads to small changes in the optical spectra up to @xmath89ev both in the lda and lda+dmft results , as it can be expected on the basis of the discussion of section iib , considering the small ( or vanishing ) value of the crystal field splitting between the localized @xmath18 orbitals at the fermi level .",
    "we have developed a program package for calculating the optical conductivity on the basis of wien2k , and make it available to the scientific community at _",
    "/ reg_user / unsupported / wien2wannier_. electronic correlations , e.g. , from dmft , or finite life times , e.g. , from impurity scattering , can be included via a corresponding self energy for the wannier orbitals . from this self - energy the green function",
    "is calculated , which together with the full dipole matrix elements yields the optical conductivity , disregarding vertex corrections@xcite .",
    "the main topic of the paper is a careful comparison between the dipole matrix element approach and the peierls approximation , which is the de facto standard for lattice model calculations .",
    "we have considered two materials srvo@xmath0 and v@xmath1o@xmath0 as testbeds .",
    "the low frequency part ( below 2 - 3 ev ) of the optical conductivity stems from @xmath2-@xmath2 transitions , at least for the two materials considered and many other transition metal oxides .",
    "this part is well captured by the peierls approximation .",
    "one can understand this by the high degree of localization of the degenerate ( or almost degenerate ) wannier @xmath2 orbitals : below @xmath141 1 ev , for both vanadates , it is also sufficient to include only the three @xmath18 bands out of the five @xmath2-orbitals . for the high frequency part ( above @xmath142 ev ) ,",
    "on the other hand , not only the @xmath2 hubbard bands are relevant but also @xmath3-@xmath2 transitions .",
    "this part of the spectrum is not well described by the peierls approximation .",
    "generalized peierls approximation , while still approximate , also improves the description of p - d transitions  @xcite at a computational cost comparable to the full dipole matrix calculation .",
    "the comparison to experiment shows that lda+dmft with full dipole matrix elements gives a good description of the optical conductivity .",
    "in contrast , the peierls approximation shows strong deviations at high frequencies .",
    "the same is true for the lda optical conductivity even with the full dipole matrix elements .",
    "for instance , the lda optical of srvo@xmath0 conductivity particularly shows a too pronounced peak at @xmath143ev .",
    "this peak stems from @xmath2-@xmath3 transitions , and the dmft correctly spreads the @xmath2 orbital spectral over a larger energy region : hubbard side bands are formed and the electron - electron scattering smears out the @xmath2 bands .",
    "the residual differences between lda+dmft and experimental infrared - spectra hence can not be ascribed to the limitation of the peierls approximation , but rather to effects beyond the lda+dmft scheme .",
    "for example , impurity scattering and the inclusion of non - local electronic correlations .",
    "the inclusion of the latter requires a considerable efforts of going beyond the standard lda+dmft scheme , e.g. , by cluster extension of dmft@xcite , dynamical vertex approximation @xcite or duals fermion@xcite , which also necessarily requires a proper treatment of vertex corrections .",

    "<S> we develop a computational approach for calculating the optical conductivity in the augmented plane wave basis set of wien2k and apply it for thoroughly comparing the full dipole matrix element calculation and the peierls approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the results for srvo@xmath0 and v@xmath1o@xmath0 show that the peierls approximation , which is commonly used in model calculations , works well for optical transitions between the @xmath2 orbitals . in a typical transition metal oxide , </S>",
    "<S> these transitions are solely responsible for the optical conductivity at low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the peierls approximation does not work , on the other hand , for optical transitions between @xmath3- and @xmath2-orbitals which usually became important at frequencies of a few evs .    </S>",
    "<S> much of our knowledge about solid state systems comes from their response to small electro - magnetic perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> a broad range of techniques has been developed to probe the nature of ground states in elastic scattering experiments and the excitations in inelastic scattering or absorption experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is usually a combination of several experimental techniques as well as theoretical calculations which allow us to draw a complete picture of a given material . among those </S>",
    "<S> , the optical spectroscopy plays an important role @xcite , complementing the photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) which is easier to access and interpret in most theories . </S>",
    "<S> probing the particle - hole excitations averaged over the brillouin zone , the optical spectra contain a different and less detailed information about the system than angle - resolved photoemission spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the main asset of the optical spectroscopy , however , is its robustness : unlike pes , it does not suffer from surface effects . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , unlike transport measurements , the optical conductivity is not critically affected by impurities or disorder : optical transitions can not simply disappear , but can only be shifted to different energies , which is expressed by the sum - rule for optical conductivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> calculations of optical spectra from first principles are well established within the effective non - interacting electron theories @xcite for weakly correlated materials such as the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite to the density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body perturbation theory on the gw level @xcite and its two - particle extensions using the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite have been successful in describing the excitonic physics in semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different in the field of strongly correlated electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> although the optical measurement on these materials proved very useful for investigation of metal - insulator transitions or mass renormalization effects , material specific theoretical investigations are rather rare  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps not surprising given the fact that calculation of one - particle spectra is already a formidable challenge .    in the past decade </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite combined with first - principles bandstructures ( lda+dmft ) @xcite showed considerable power to describe correlated materials . </S>",
    "<S> this theory allows for an accurate description of the local ( intra - atomic ) dynamics , while the inter - atomic effects are treated on the static mean - field level . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , dmft is not restricted to a particular energy scale and thus allows for the simultaneous description of quasiparticles on mev scale and atomic excitations on the ev scale , which is crucial to capture the spectral weight transfers in the optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> first optical calculations with dmft were performed for the single - band hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the local approximation of dmft leads to vanishing of the vertex corrections to the optical conductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the electron and hole created in the process of optical excitation behave independently and thus the green s function of the electron - hole pair is a product of two one - particle green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> this is not necessarily true in multi - band models , except for the case of degenerate bands . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dipole selection rules at optical frequencies typically forbid creation of an electron - hole pair on the same atom and thus the vertex corrections may be neglected also in this case , an approximation we also adopt throughout this work . </S>",
    "<S> note that for inelastic x - ray scattering experiments optical transitions with finite momentum transfer allow formation of strongly bound local electron - hole pairs , excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex corrections in this case are substantial . </S>",
    "<S> a typical example are the crystal - field @xmath2-@xmath2 excitations deep in the optical gap of transition metal oxides ; see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> hansmann11 for a v@xmath1o@xmath0 calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> while the formal framework for calculating the optical conductivity within the above approximations is well established , the numerical implementation poses several challenges : i ) @xmath4-space integration , ii ) determination of the optical transition amplitudes and inclusion of states in a broad energy window , iii ) evaluation of optical spectra for real frequencies , which is an additional problem arising for particular numerical techniques , such as quantum monte - carlo simulations , used to solve the dmft equations . </S>",
    "<S> different strategies for dealing with these issues are possible . in this article , we present an implementation based on the wannier functions formalism and a direct calculation of the transition amplitudes from the one - particle wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to the so - called peierls approximation , which relies on the * k*-derivatives of the effective low - energy hamiltonian of the systems considered and discuss their relationship . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze specifically two well - known correlated oxides , srvo@xmath0 and v@xmath1o@xmath0 , as archetypes , and compare our results to the available experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : computationaldetails ] , we give details on the lda+dmft calculation . in section [ sec : dipole ] the technical details of the dipole matrix element caculation are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : peierls ] discussed the relationship to the peierls approximation , which is popular for lattice models . </S>",
    "<S> sections [ sec : srvo3 ] and [ sec : v2o3 ] present the results for srvo@xmath0 and v@xmath1o@xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
