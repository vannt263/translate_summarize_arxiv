    "the study of dielectron production in hadron and heavy - ion reactions addresses various issues of general interest . in heavy - ion collisions",
    "the dileptons are considered as a tool for accessing in - medium modifications of vector mesons .",
    "for example , at relativistic energies , the behavior of the @xmath4 meson attracted much attention because the dilepton data @xcite point to a reshuffling of strength in a hot , meson - dominated medium @xcite .",
    "this has been discussed in the wider context of chiral symmetry restoration ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , qcd sum rules ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and hadronic models ( cf .",
    "likewise , the dielectron production in heavy - ion collisions at beam energies of a @xmath5 agev is interesting due to similar reasons . also here",
    "the dielectron channel is considered as an appropriate tool for studying in - medium modification of vector mesons in a baryon - dense medium .",
    "after the first round of experiments with dls @xcite , the hades spectrometer at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi / darmstadt @xcite , beginning now with experiments , is built to verify these predictions related to fundamental symmetry properties of strong interaction physics .",
    "the experimental feasibilities at hades ( e.g. , the disposal of beams of pions , protons and a wide range of nuclei ) triggered an enhanced activity in this field .",
    "clearly , for an understanding of dielectron spectra in hadron - nucleus and heavy - ion collisions the elementary hadronic reaction channels must be under control . here the reactions @xmath6 and @xmath7 occupy a highly important place in the dielectron physics .",
    "these reactions serve as a necessary input for kinetic approaches ( cf .",
    "but on the other hand , they are interesting for themselves because they are mainly related to the baryon resonance dynamics .",
    "different facets of the manifestation of baryon resonances in @xmath8 collisions have been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . particularly interesting",
    "are such recent theoretical approaches as in @xcite which attempt a unifying description of meson - nucleon interactions .",
    "the quantum interference in @xmath9 decays of intermediate @xmath4 and @xmath3 mesons produced in the exclusive reaction @xmath10 has been first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the first round of hades experiments will experimentally address this problem @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the @xmath0 interference in dielectron production has also an another interesting aspect : the interference may be used as a tool for studying the isoscalar part of the electromagnetic current in the resonance region , what is rather difficult to do by another methods .",
    "varying the dilepton invariant mass @xmath11 one can test low - lying baryon resonances which are deeply subthreshold for on - shell omega production .",
    "of course , the contribution of the isoscalar part ( i.e. , the virtual @xmath3 production ) is much smaller than the dominant isovector ( i.e. , virtual @xmath4 production ) at @xmath12 but it may be clearly seen in the @xmath0 interference which is proportional to the difference of the @xmath13 cross sections in @xmath14 and @xmath15 collisions .    indeed , since the electromagnetic current is the sum of isoscalar and isovector components @xcite , the invariant amplitude of the reaction @xmath1 with total isospin @xmath16 may be expressed as @xmath17 where , according to the vector dominance model , the isoscalar ( isovector ) contributions may be identified with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson intermediate states , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a rotation by 180@xmath20 around the @xmath21-axis in isospin space leads to the transformations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and , therefore , one gets @xmath27 that means , the quantum interferences in the reactions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are different , and these differences might be well observable in the vicinity of the @xmath3 resonance peak . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath3 production in @xmath8 interactions has been analyzed within an approach based on tree level diagrams and effective lagrangians . a strong contribution in the near - threshold energy region",
    "is found to stem from the @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels of nucleon and baryon resonances amplitudes . in the present work we will consider these dominant amplitudes as depicted in fig .  1 . (",
    "the restriction to @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels , and the exclusion of the @xmath32 channel , is in line with the concept of duality . )",
    "we will account for the resonances with mass @xmath33 gev ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this means that , together with the @xmath35 interferences one has to consider the strong `` internal '' interferences within the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels separately which are in turn different in both channels .",
    "therefore , the proper choice of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 coupling constants and their phases becomes the central problem . to demonstrate the @xmath35 interferences within a concise framework we rely mainly on @xcite , where the relevant coupling constants are expressed in terms of the corresponding couplings to the nucleon by using a quark model .",
    "we will also briefly discuss the possibility to use the known partial widths of @xmath39 decays to fix the absolute values of @xmath40 couplings .",
    "our approach highlights the role of the coupling of subthreshold resonances to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 systems ( cf .",

    "in summary we have performed a combined analysis of the dielectron invariant mass distributions for the exclusive reactions @xmath160 and @xmath165 near the @xmath3 threshold .",

    "the found isospin effect is sensitive to the resonance coupling parameters and , therefore , may be used as a powerful tool for the study of the resonance dynamics in dielectron production processes .",
    "we have shown that our predictions can be experimentally tested by measuring the angular distribution of decay particles in reactions of the type @xmath198 which are accessible with the pion beam at the hades spectrometer at gsi / darmstadt @xcite .",
