    "mirror symmetry is an extremely interesting example of duality in three - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with moduli spaces ( studied in @xcite,@xcite for @xmath0 supersymmetry ) .",
    "the duality involves pairs of gauge theories flowing to the same superconformal fixed point in the ir .",
    "in particular , mirror symmetry exchanges the coulomb and the higgs branches of the moduli spaces of the two theories and leads to a linear map(known as the `` mirror map '' ) between the fayet - iliopoulos parameters associated with vector multiplets in one theory and masses of hypermultiplets in the other .",
    "the flavor symmetry at the superconformal fixed point is enhanced and this enhanced flavor symmetry group in the deep ir includes the flavor symmetry groups of the individual gauge theories as subgroups .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to theories with @xmath0 supersymmetry in this work . + a large class of three - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories",
    "can be realized as world - volume theories on coincident d3 branes ( with one compact direction ) with appropriate boundary conditions at the two ends @xcite , imposed by the presence of 5-branes ( or orbifold / orientifold planes as we shall explain later ) spanning directions orthogonal to the compact direction . given a gauge theory with such a description , the mirror dual is obtained simply as the world - volume theory on the same set of coincident d3 branes with s - dual boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , mirror symmetry can be understood as a consequence of s - duality in type iib string theory .",
    "+ in @xcite , mirror duality between pairs of @xmath9 quiver gauge theories was deduced in this fashion and the construction was later extended to @xmath10 quivers @xcite . in this note , we focus on the m - theory/ type iia realization of mirror symmetry for these quiver gauge theories , the basic idea for which was laid out in @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the complete m - theory description of the duality for pairs of @xmath9-type quivers and then show how the m - theory picture provides a nice way to catalogue mirror dual theories . in the process , we obtain new mirror pairs in addition to the more well - known examples discussed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we discuss the type iib realization for some of these theories .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is devoted to studying the duality of mirror pairs using a direct comparison of their partition functions on @xmath8 .",
    "the basic strategy is to show that the partition functions of the dual theories ( each of which can be expressed as finite - dimensional integrals ) are related by a simple redefinition of integration variables .",
    "in addition to confirming the duality , this provides a nice way to read off the mirror map between dual theories . in @xcite ,",
    "such an analysis was performed for dual pairs involving @xmath9-type quivers . here",
    ", we extend that computation to include certain theories involving @xmath10-type quivers and derive the mirror maps in such cases , comparing our results to predictions from type iib considerations .    the paper is organized as follows : section 2 deals with the basic properties of @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions and presents an elementary discussion on the type iib description of mirror symmetry . in section 3 , we describe the m - theory picture and present a catalogue of mirror pairs that can arise in this fashion .",

    "@xmath0 supersymmetry in @xmath11 has 8 real supercharges , which are doublets of @xmath12 and transform as @xmath13 under the r - symmetry group , @xmath14 .",
    "the massless supermultiplets are most conveniently obtained by dimensional reduction of the @xmath15 supersymmetry in @xmath16 , where the supercharges are four - component majorana - weyl spinors ( in @xmath16 ) transforming as doublets of the @xmath17 r - symmetry .",
    "the massless representations of the poincare algebra are labelled by the representations of the little group @xmath18 : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denote the `` spins '' for the representations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the particle content of the lowest massless representations ( those without the graviton , or particles of yet - higher spin ) of @xmath23 can be summarized as follows :    tensor multiplet:@xmath24    vector multiplet:@xmath25    half - hyper multiplet:@xmath26    where we have indicated the representation of @xmath27 , and denoted the fermions in bold .    on dimensional reduction to three dimensions ,",

    "strictly speaking , the latter can be dualized to a circle - valued scalar only for an abelian gauge field . in that case",
    ", we obtain 4 scalars , transforming overall as @xmath35 . nevertheless , for a non - abelian gauge field , the gauge symmetry ( on either the coulomb or higgs branches ) is higgsed to @xmath36 an abelian subgroup .",

    "the low - energy theory has a r - symmetry @xmath55 ( the superconformal symmetry ) , which , in most cases , coincides with the manifest @xmath14 in the lagrangian description of the theory .",
    "for such theories , the conformal dimension for the bosonic fields is 1 for the vector multiplet and @xmath56 for the hypermultiplet .",
    "this obviously implies that the yang - mills term in the lagrangian is irrelevant in the ir .",
    "the ir limit thus coincides with the strong coupling limit of the gauge theory , @xmath57 .",

    "in the next section , we discuss the type iib description of this duality for a discrete family of @xmath9 quiver gauge theory pairs .",
    "the most commonly cited example of mirror duality involves the following discrete family of quiver gauge theory pairs :    a - model:@xmath66 gauge theory with the matter content given by an extended @xmath67 quiver diagram ( [ fig1l ] ( a ) ) with the @xmath68th node being identified with the first node .",

    "then the length of the @xmath84-th column of the young diagram ( the right - hand - most column is assigned @xmath85 ) is given as @xmath86 , thereby determining the set of integers @xmath79 .",
    "finally , masses and fi parameters of the a - model are related to the fi parameters and masses of the b - model respectively by a set of linear equations , usually called `` mirror maps '' . for the a - model ,",
    "the total number of independent fi parameters is @xmath80 ( one for each @xmath48 in the gauge group ) while the number of independent mass parameters is @xmath87 - accounting for the linear combination of masses that can be eliminated for every @xmath48 factor in the gauge group by shifting the origin of the coulomb branch . for the b - model ,",
    "the total number of independent mass parameters is @xmath88 while the number of fi parameters is @xmath89 , following the same reasoning as in the a - model .",
    "this gives a counting evidence of the fact that mirror duality exchanges masses and fi parameters .",
    "the precise form of the mirror map between fi parameters of the a - model and mass parameters of the b - model is given by @xcite ,    @xmath90    or equivalently by ,    @xmath91    mirror duality for any pair of theories , described above , can be interpreted as a direct consequence of s - duality by resorting to a type iib brane construction involving d3 , d5 and ns5 branes @xcite .",

    "finally , d3 branes wrapping @xmath97 can stretch between pairs of 5 branes located at adjacent points on the @xmath98 .    the configuration of branes described above preserves eight real supercharges - appropriate amount of supersymmetry for @xmath0 theories in three dimensions .",
    "since the 5-branes are infinitely extended in two directions transverse to the 3-branes , the 5-brane world - volume fields have infinitely large volume coefficients in their kinetic terms compared to the world - volume fields on the d3 brane . as a result , 5 brane fields can essentially be treated as frozen backgrounds and enter the world - volume theory of the d3 branes as moduli in the effective qft .    a d3 brane wraps the compact direction @xmath98 , along which the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional world - volume theory can be kaluza - klein reduced to give a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theory . dynamical fields in this theory naturally arise from lightest excitations of open strings stretched between pairs of d - branes . following the discussion in @xcite ,",
    "the properties of this ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theory can be read off from the brane construction as follows :    @xmath99 open strings beginning and ending on @xmath100 coincident d3 branes stretched between two ns5 branes give a @xmath101vector multiplet with a gauge group @xmath102 .",
    "the gauge coupling for the vector multiplet is given as ,    @xmath103    where @xmath104 are the positions of the two ns5 branes on @xmath98 .",

    "@xmath99 the positions of the ns5 branes in @xmath109 correspond to the fi parameters for the gauge groups .",
    "assuming that all the d3 branes are located at the origin of @xmath110 , the positions of the d5 branes in @xmath110 correspond to the masses of the fundamental hypers .",
    "the masses of the bifundamental hypers correspond to the relative position of d3 branes between the @xmath46th pair of ns5 branes with respect to the d3 branes between the @xmath105th pair along @xmath110 , which we set to zero .    with these rules , one can immediately write down the appropriate type iib brane construction for the a - model .",
    "it simply consists of @xmath80 ns5 branes arranged in a circle with @xmath111 d5 branes located between the @xmath46th and the @xmath105th ns5 on the circle , such that @xmath112 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath80 sets of @xmath100 d3 branes stretched between the @xmath80 pairs of ns5 branes , without any relative displacement along @xmath110 .",
    "now , let us consider the action of s - duality on this system .",
    "ns5 and d5 branes transform into each other under s - duality while d3 branes remain invariant .",
    "the s - dual system consists of @xmath89 ns5 branes and @xmath80 d5 branes and one can easily see that the number of d5 branes between the @xmath73th and the @xmath113th ns5 is precisely @xmath74 ( for all @xmath73 ) - the answer expected from the young diagram rule stated above ( after a possible cyclic permutation of brane labels).therefore , the s - dual system clearly gives a type iib brane construction for the b - model : a @xmath71 gauge theory described by a @xmath9 quiver and a distribution of @xmath80 fundamental hypers among its @xmath89 nodes given by the sequence @xmath114 .",
    "also , since positions of ns5 and d5 are interchanged , the mapping of fi parameters to masses and vice - versa is trivially achieved.this is how mirror duality in three dimension can be understood as a consequence of s - duality in a type iib set - up .    in the next section ,",
    "we present another description of the duality in terms of a type iia / m - theory .",

    "since d3 branes on the left and right of each ns5 brane can be chosen to have same position in @xmath110 , all the bifundamental masses can be set to zero . also , the total number of fi parameters is @xmath290 , which can be seen as follows .",

    "evidently , the number of fi parameters for the b - model is @xmath267 while the number of fundamental mass parameters is @xmath290 .",
    "since the d3 branes at the two boundaries actually end on the boundary d5 branes and therefore have to be localized at the same @xmath110 points as the respective d5s , the two fundamental hypers ( originating from the d3-d5 open strings for the boundary d5s ) will be massless .",
    "the number of fundamental masses will then correspond to the positions of the remaining d5 branes , namely , @xmath297 .",
    "however , all the bifundamental masses can not be set to zero by the same reasoning as before .",
    "since the d3 branes at the two boundaries have different @xmath110 positions , one can only set @xmath274 of those to zero leaving behind one massive bifundamental hyper .",
