    "in this paper , we propose a concept learning formulation for reasoning about complex 3-d objects , using multisensory perception information , specifically visual and haptic sensory data .",
    "we first explore the definitions of _ concepts _ , _ rational rules _ , and the _ language of thought _ from the literature , and describe how these can form a basis for concept learning .",
    "we then extend these definitions to motivate and formulate our proposed computational approach for reasoning about objects using a multisensory perception system .      in @xcite ,",
    "et al._presented three standard intuitions relating to the notion of concepts , which we restate in order to motivate our computational approach to concept learning for multisensory object perception .",
    "`` concepts are mental representations that are used to discriminate between objects , events , relations , or other states of affairs . ''",
    "specifically in machine perception , we are concerned with those concepts that can be used to specify classes or categories of things .",
    "`` concepts are learned inductively from the sparse and noisy data of an uncertain world .... even very sparse and noisy evidence , such as a few randomly encountered examples , can be sufficient for a young child to accurately grasp a new concept . ''",
    "this notion of learning about concepts from sparse noisy data is somewhat contrary to the philosophy embraced by many current state - of - the art approaches in machine perception , where the norm is to collect a very large number of examples for training an agent @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we describe a method of learning about object - related concepts from very few randomly selected instances , in a multisensory setting .    ``",
    "many concepts are formed by combining simpler concepts , and the meanings of complex concepts are derived in systematic ways from the meanings of their constituents . ''",
    "this intuition about concepts attempts to explain how a rational agent agent ( human or machine ) is able to elicit complex meanings from the raw sensory data that it perceives . in this work",
    ", we first separate the raw sensory data perceived from the governing concepts and then unify them in the proposed computational framework .",
    "one early observation to make about concepts thus far , is the need for a set of rules to define that concept .",
    "we refer to these as the _ rational rules _ , the set of rules for designing and regulating a system , based on technical knowledge , and with the aim of achieving optimum outcomes .",
    "rational rules can be based on universal laws such as the laws of physics , laws of morality , _ etc .",
    "_ , or on more domain specific principles such as gestalt principles of visual perception , but whatever the domain - of - interest , these rational rules serve to provide an agent with a belief system or a framework to make predictions about how the world works .",
    "thus , when given a statement about the world , an agent can determine its degree of truthfulness based on this belief system .",
    "for clarity , we define an agent as the possessor of the ability to reason rationally .    from the cognitive psychology literature fodor",
    "@xcite explains cognition as computations over syntactically structured symbols or representations governed by a set of rules .",
    "this paradigm known as the language - of - thought ( lot ) , attempts to explain cognitive processes such as perception , language - learning , rational choice , _ etc .",
    "_ , cognitively / computationally . a limitation of such rule - based systems occurs when performing inductive learning in complex systems having only sparse and noisy examples . in this case , the set of rules can easily blow - up combinatorially , in an attempt to faithfully explain all instances encountered .",
    "there was therefore the need to handle systematically uncertainties , by use of probabilistic models .    the work by goodman _",
    "et al._@xcite provided a unifying theory to quantitatively relate the rule - based , combinatorial lot with a rational statistical approach to concept learning , but unlike their studies , work presented in @xcite , where the focus is primarily on general boolean concept learning , we propose a very specific computational framework for a multimodal rational agent to learn inductively about the concepts of 3-d objects in a scale and viewpoint invariant manner , when presented with few and noisy visual and/or haptics sensory data .",
    "mounting evidence from the cognitive and neuroscience literature supporting the metamodal hypothesis , suggest that _ core object recognition and categorization _ is solved in the brain via a cascade of reflexive , largely feedforward computations in the inferior temporal cortex , which extend beyond the domain of vision to other biological senses ( e.g. , touch , audition , olfaction)@xcite .",
    "et al._in @xcite explored how the brain computes this recognition solution by considering the problem at different levels of abstraction .",
    "yildrim and jacobs @xcite explored how object recognition knowledge could be transferred across the visual and haptic modalities via a feedforward computational model and supported their claims with corresponding human experiments .",
    "quiroga _ et al._@xcite reported on a subset of human medial temporal lobe ( mtl ) neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals , landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names . as an example , a specific neuron fired selectively to pictures of the movie star halle berry and responded also to the letter string halle berry ( but not to other names of known and unknown people , animals and places ) .",
    "the selective responses of these neurons could still be triggered by stimuli in other sensory modalities , such as the name of a person pronounced by a synthesized voice@xcite .",
    "quiroga thus argued that the brain contains `` concept cells '' , involved in the representation of individual people or objects regardless of the modality used to sense those people or objects .",
    "similarly , konkle _",
    "et al._@xcite hypothesized that the same neural region processes motion regardless of the modality through which the motion was sensed .",
    "they found that motion aftereffects transferred between vision and touch - when adapted to visual motion in a certain direction , people felt tactile motion aftereffects in the opposite direction , and vice versa .",
    "these results thus suggest the clear distinction between ( i ) the internal representations of the external world , ( ii ) the stimulus or sensation ( _ e.g._the image impinging on the retina ) and ( iii ) their perception or the interpretations given to the stimulus .    why would the brain possess representations and operations that are shared by multiple sensory modalities ? it is possible that these representations and operations efficiently support perception in a world where many basic parameters of sensory stimulation - space , time , and intensity - co - vary across multiple sensory signals . by developing a computational framework that takes advantage of statistical properties across modalities ,",
    "objects are treated as concepts and are characterized in terms of their intrinsic 3-d properties , rather than by only their sensory properties .",
    "the major goal of this work therefore , is to develop a realistic model that integrates the major themes on concepts and concept learning as listed in section [ sec : concepts ] , by ( a ) identifying a set of rational rules that govern the cognitive processes of specifying classes or categories of 3-d objects ; ( b ) transforming these rules into a probabilistic generative grammar for 3-d objects ( the concept language ) ; ( d ) generating a compositional hypothesis space of candidate concepts from the grammar ; ( e ) developing a realistic multimodal perception - driven likelihood function to relate each hypothesis to sensory object data ; and lastly , ( f ) performing bayesian inference over the grammatically structured hypothesis space .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model by successfully making several levels of inferences ( such as categorizing objects , providing viewpoint information on objects when encountered in the wild , _ etc .",
    "_ ) on abstract objects when presented with multisensory object data .",
    "the closest work to our proposed methodology is that of yildrim and jacobs @xcite , where they explored how object recognition knowledge could be transferred across the visual and haptic modalities and supported their claims with corresponding human experiments .",
    "the major difference between this work and theirs is that their focus was very much on showing _ experimentally _ in humans that object category learning does truly transfer between modalities , and then building a simplistic computational model to support their findings .",
    "in our study , we assume that objects are characterized completely by their overall shape and are categorized by the different parts ( and their locations ) that make up the object .",
    "we perform our multisensory object recognitions study on a set of artificially generated 3-d objects known as _ fribbles_. fribbles were originally developed by @xcite for the study of visual object recognition and the subset we are using in this study was made publicly available by @xcite .",
    "fribbles are complex , multi - part 3-d objects with categorical structures , and as such are ecologically valid as objects that can be used in building visual - haptic computational models ( such as we propose ) . one major advantage of using fribbles is the fact that the simulated visual and haptic renderings for our computational model are perfectly matched , given that they were 3-d printed from the same 3-d object models .",
    "the dataset consists of 40 fribbles organized into four categories with 10 exemplars per category and the category prototypes differ in their constituent parts .",
    "an exemplar for a category is created by perturbing the category prototype primarily in terms of its constituent parts .",
    "each constituent part exists in only one spatial location so we use this feature to simplify our model in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "each fribble object in the dataset is associated with a 3-d object model and an image of the fribble from a canonical viewpoint clearly showing the parts of the fribble .",
    "figure [ fig : fribsamples ] illustrates eight such fribbles , two from each of the four categories . a small subset of the constituent parts that make up the fribbles is also shown .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        * place results of vision based categorization here .... * select each of the 16 test samples for each test sample , perturb the orientation and scale of the test fribble get the prototype of each of the 4 classes generate the 27 images at different orientations and use the hog to compute which class this image is closest to set that class value as the class of this test fribble .",
    "complete test and enter table here ....      figure [ fig : confmatrix ] shows the categorization results using both haptics information .",
    "we select the four test examples from each category and present each one to graspit ! in order to generate the haptic sensory data ( synonymous with the agent touching the objects ) .",
    "the resulting grasp joint angles are presented to the model , and the sensory grasp joint angles are compared to the grasp joint angles of each of the 4 model prototypes .",
    "the test grasp is therefore classified as belonging to the category of the prototype that it is closest in distance to .",
    "the resulting confusion matrix is shown in figure [ fig : confmatrix ] .",
    "r c c c c & * c1 * & * c2 * & * c3 * & * c4 * + * c1 * & 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 + * c2 * & 0 & 3 & 1 & 0 + * c3 * & 0 & 2 & 2 & 0 + * c4 * & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 +",
    "in this study , we successfully developed a multimodal learning framework that integrated major themes on concepts and concepts learning by using a probabilistic generative grammar on which we performed inference via bayesian induction .",
    "we performed our multisensory object recognitions study on a set of artificially generated 3-d objects , fribbles , and successfully performed scale - invariant , pose - invariant object categorization by comparing test samples with the 4-class prototypes ( sampled 3d objects with the largest posterior probability ) .",
    "when clean , known samples are presented to the model , it gives an accuracy of approximately 71% with haptic sensory data .    in the future , rather than only comparing the test cases to the sample prototypes ( thus assuming that the test case was generated from the model ) , it will be useful to directly present the test cases to the model to determine the nature of parse trees that will be generated from the sensory data . this way the likelihood of an object being a fribble or not can also be computed .",
    "lastly , it will be interesting to perform an in - depth study of how scale changes affect haptics , and at what scale the grasp simulator will fail to distinguish between object categories . on a grander scale , can we now develop computational models for _ `` any notion '' _ once we can encode its rational rules and can compute likelihood measures ?"
