    "in general , observed astrophysical objects are characterized by a non - spherically symmetric distribution of mass and by rotation . in many cases , like ordinary planets and satellites , it is possible to neglect the deviations from spherical symmetry and the frame dragging effect , so that the gravitational field can be described by the exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "in fact , the three classical tests of general relativity make use of the schwarzschild spacetime in order to describe gravity within the solar system@xcite . in the case of strong gravitational fields , however ,",
    "the deviation from spherical symmetry and the rotation become important and must be taken into account , at least to some extent .",
    "the first metric describing the exterior field of a slowly rotating slightly deformed object was found by hartle and thorne@xcite in 1968 .",
    "alternative methods were proposed independently by fock and abdildin@xcite and sedrakyan and chubaryan@xcite . only recently , it was shown that in fact all these approaches are equivalent from a mathematical point of view@xcite . at the level of the interpretation of the parameters entering the metric used in each approach",
    ", certain differences can appear which could make a particular approach more suitable for the investigation of certain problems .",
    "for the purpose of the present work , it is convenient to use the hartle - thorne formalism which leads to an approximate metric describing , up to the first order in the quadrupole and the second order in the angular momentum , the exterior gravitational field of a rotating deformed object .",
    "we will use in this work the hartle - thorne metric in the form presented by bini et al.@xcite which in geometrical units is given by @xmath0dt^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left(1-\\frac{2{m}}{r}\\right)^{-1}\\left[1 - 2k_2p_2(\\cos\\theta)-2\\left(1-\\frac{2{m}}{r}\\right)^{-1}\\frac{j^{2}}{r^4}\\right]dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + r^2[1 - 2k_3p_2(\\cos\\theta)](d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)-4\\frac{j}{r}\\sin^2\\theta dt d\\phi\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 here @xmath2 is legendre polynomial of the first kind , @xmath3 are the associated legendre functions of the second kind determined as @xmath4 , \\nonumber\\\\ q_{2}^{2}(x)&=&(x^{2}-1)\\left[\\frac{3}{2}\\ln\\frac{x+1}{x-1}-\\frac{3x^{3}-5x}{(x^{2}-1)^2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the constants @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the total mass , angular momentum and mass quadrupole moment of the rotating object , respectively ( for more details see refs .   and ) . is related to the mass quadrupole moment defined by hartle and thorne@xcite through @xmath8 . ]    the approximate kerr metric@xcite in boyer - lindquist coordinates can be obtained from the above hartle - thorne metric after setting @xmath9 and making a coordinate transformation implicitly given by @xmath10\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\theta&=&\\theta+\\frac{a^2}{2r^2}\\left(1+\\frac{2m}{r}\\right)\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the kerr metric is important to investigate the physical processes taking place around rotating black holes , i.e. , the source with probably the strongest possible gravitational field .",
    "the role of rotation is essential in the physics of accretion disks and energy extraction from a black hole .",
    "moreover , depending on the direction of the rotation , the radius of the accretion disk can be larger or smaller with respect to the schwarzschild case .",
    "the situation changes when one involves compact objects such as white dwarfs , neutron stars and quark stars as they have additional parameters to be taken into account .",
    "the combination of the strong field with the quadrupolar deformation of the source plays a pivotal role when one considers the motion of test particles .",
    "there exist many exact solutions that include a quadrupole parameter .",
    "the importance of the quadrupole moment in the astrophysical context has been emphasized in several works@xcite .",
    "however , most analysis must be performed numerically due to the complexity of the exact metrics .",
    "the advantage of considering the hartle - thorne approximate solution is that several physical quantities can be calculated analytically which facilitates their study",
    ". we will prove below that this is possible for a particular set of geodesics . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in studying the motion of test particles in the hartle - thorne spacetime .",
    "therefore , we will perform both analytical and numerical analysis of the timelike and lightlike geodesic equations . in particular",
