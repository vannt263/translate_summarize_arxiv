    "yukawa systems , i.e. many particle systems where the pair interaction potential energy is @xmath0 have been of interest for some time . the yukawa potential has the unique feature that by varying the screening parameter @xmath1 the potential can assume the feature both of a short range ( hard sphere like ) and of a long range ( coulomb like ) interaction potential . since the 1970-s this feature motivated a number of investigations relating to the properties of yukawa liquids and solids , their phases and phase transitions @xcite . quite apart from this academic interest ,",
    "the yukawa potential has been recognized as a good approximation for the interaction potential between charged particles in colloids @xcite and , more recently , in complex ( dusty ) plasmas , where the original coulomb interaction between the main constituents is transformed by debye screening into a yukawa - type potential ( for a review see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "complex plasmas constitute an especially suitable medium for the study of waves and collective excitations because these are much less damped than in colloidal systems . in recent years a host of papers ,",
    "both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite have studied collective modes in yukawa systems @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental work on colloidal systems and complex plasmas has focused attention on two dimensional ( 2d ) layers .",
    "we note that the physics of the 2d and 3d systems , the dynamics of the collective excitations in particular , is , in fact , quite different and addressing 2d and 3d systems separately is also warranted on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "the strength of the coupling between the particles can be characterized by the nominal bare coupling parameter @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "a physically more meaningful @xmath4 that , basically represents the ratio of the potential and kinetic energies , can be defined for orientation purposes as @xmath5 @xcite , although more sophisticated expressions are available @xcite .",
    "the main interest lies in the behavior of the strongly coupled state , @xmath6 . in this strongly coupled state",
    "the system can be either in the dense liquid or in the crystalline solid phase .",
    "past works on the dynamics have overwhelmingly concentrated on yukawa systems consisting of one single component , the equivalent of the one component plasma , both in three and two dimensions ( y3docp and y2docp , respectively ) .",
    "a great deal of theoretical @xcite and computer simulation @xcite efforts have been devoted to the mapping and understanding of the collective mode structures in these systems , both in the liquid and solid phases .",
    "the theoretical methods required in the two situations are , of course , quite different .",
    "once the lattice structure is identified , the crystalline solid is amenable to the standard harmonic phonon analysis . concerning the treatment of the collective modes in the strongly coupled liquid phase , the quasi localized charge approximation ( qlca ) approach developed by",
    "kalman and golden @xcite has turned out quite successful .",
    "the qlca borrows ideas from the harmonic phonon approximation and describes the liquid in terms of particles trapped and oscillating in local potential wells of the fluctuating potential ( for details , see @xcite ) . as a result of these works , the collective mode spectra of the y3docp and y2docp",
    "are well understood and this understanding is well corroborated by observations @xcite .",
    "as to strongly coupled yukawa mixtures consisting of more than one single species , in particular binary yukawa mixtures ( y3dbm , y2dbm ) , the collective dynamics of these systems constitutes a largely unexplored area ( see , however , a recent work by daligault @xcite ) , even though the problem is of great theoretical interest .",
    "( for a related one dimensional problem see @xcite ) .",
    "one expects that the simple analytic structure of the yukawa potential allows one to derive nearly exact solutions , which will elucidate the common features of the dynamics of binary liquids and solids @xcite .",
    "also , the flexibility of the yukawa interaction would make the qualitative features of the results to serve as paradigms for the collective mode structures of binary systems interacting through other potentials as well ( alloys , dipole systems , etc . ) . from the point of view of actual applications , the creations of binary complex plasmas",
    "has technical problems , but , nevertheless , one expects that such strongly coupled complex plasmas of two different grain species will become available in the near future .",
    "this paper , the first in a series , presents a systematic study of he collective mode spectra of the y2dbm system .",
    "the system consists of two species , with charges @xmath7 and @xmath8 , masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 and densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( or concentrations @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "our strategy is similar to the one followed in our previous works on the y3docp and y2docp : for the theoretical analysis of the liquid state we apply the qlca formalism ; for the crystalline solid we calculate dispersion relations by the standard method . in both cases , we parallel our theoretical analysis with detailed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the density and current fluctuation spectra of the system ; it is , then , the positions of the peaks of the fluctuation spectra from which the dispersion relations are inferred .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that following this road map is fraught with questions stemming from the fundamental difference between the binary and single component systems .",
    "concerning the qlca , is it justified to represent the system through separate collective coordinates for each of the species in a liquid where the two species are spatially not separated ? concerning the md , if different partial fluctuation spectra provide conflicting information , which one of them should be accepted as most relevant to the actual dispersion ?",
    "finally , one has to be aware of the fact that in the presence of different @xmath7 and @xmath8 charges with different @xmath13 and @xmath14 concentrations , the liquid phase is governed by a complex phase diagram @xcite in which only certain combinations of these parameters allows a homogeneous system . in the solid phase , similarly , with a given set of parameters only certain lattice structures are permissible @xcite .",
    "we tackle these issues along the work as presented in the sequel .",
    "we have to emphasize though , that our goal is restricted to determining the existence , interrelationships and dispersion of the collective modes .",
    "we do not address a number of related problems : the damping of the modes , the detailed structures and the link between the various fluctuation spectra , the critical freezing values of @xmath15 , the nature of the underlying order in the liquid phase , lattice stability and structures , etc .",
    "the issues investigated in this paper are organized according to the following plan : section ii is devoted to the description of the liquid phase and section iii of the crystalline solid phase . in each case",
    "we first analyze the qualitative features of the optic ( @xmath16 finite at @xmath17 ) and then the acoustic ( @xmath18 as @xmath19 ) excitations , before presenting the description of the full mode structure . in section iii",
    "we compare the mode structures in the two phases and draw conclusions .",
    "( for a preliminary account of some of the results pertaining to the optic modes see @xcite and to the acoustic modes see @xcite ) .",
    "whenever not noted otherwise , we measure frequencies in units of @xmath20 , the plasma frequency of species 1 , use @xmath21 , the bare coupling value for species 1 to characterize the coupling strength , and adopt @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) for the screening parameter .",

    ", the effect of the different density ratios has to be kept in mind : while in the former the difference between the @xmath85 and @xmath118 cases does not make a major difference , in the latter the two different crystal structures ( sr and hc ) substantially affect the mode structure .    focusing first on the low-@xmath60 acoustic excitations ,",
    "we see that there is an almost perfect agreement between the liquid qlca and md sound speeds , on the one hand , and the corresponding values in the liquid and in the two crystal structures studied , on the other hand",
    ". the only difference of note , as we have already pointed out , arises in the case of the sr lattice , due to its anisotropy , which results in a narrow band of sound speeds ; in the liquid , as represented by the qlca , it is replaced by an angular average . the most important result that emerges from all this is the fact that the low frequency excitations are governed by oscillation frequency @xmath16 of the virtual average atom ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:226 ] ) which is created by the average charges and masses of all the components .",
    "this effect , as it was discussed in some detail elsewhere @xcite , has its most dramatic manifestation for the effective mass of the nominal plasma frequency of the binary ( with respective masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , which in the weakly coupled case is formed , in general , through the `` parallel connection '' of the two masses ( @xmath228 ) , but which in the strongly coupled case becomes the `` series connection '' of the two masses ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "while the vaa has been a useful heuristic concept for liquid alloys @xcite and for disordered systems @xcite , and also in connection with self - diffusion @xcite , here we have been able to give a rigorous demonstration through the qlca of the emergence of this phenomenon .",
    "the md simulation has shown ( see figs . [",
    "fig : gapeins ]  [ fig : effmass ] ) that in the @xmath202 limit the vaa concept becomes `` exact '' , in the sense that after the subtraction of the explicitly identifiable pair correlation @xmath96 dependent correlational contribution it determines the sound speed . with decreasing @xmath15",
    "the @xmath230 decreases , seemingly marching towards weak coupling limit , but within the boundaries of our md simulation which covers only the @xmath231 domain , the behavior is still essentially strongly coupled , in that the decrease of @xmath230 from its high @xmath15 value is quite slow .",
    "however , this decrease of @xmath230 in the moderately coupled domain is not reflected by the qlca model : there @xmath230 preserves its high @xmath15 value ( eq . [ eq : efm ] ) for any @xmath15 .",
    "this is the first inadequacy of the qlca and it is the consequence of the fact that the appearance of the vaa structure is formally correlation independent .",
    "correlational effects appear only indirectly , through the model from which it is derived and which adopts quasilocalization as its basis .",
    "that the quasilocalization can lead to such a qualitative effect is a novel feature of the approximation , which manifests itself only in binary systems .",
    "in contrast , in the single component system , the weakly coupled and strongly coupled states differ through their explicit correlation function dependence only .",
    "a hallmark of the binary system is the emergence of  one or more ",
    "optic modes with a @xmath17 gap frequency . in the liquid state",
    "there is only one gap frequency , corresponding to the two  longitudinal and transverse ",
    "modes that become degenerate at @xmath17 , due to the isotropy of the liquid . in the crystal lattice",
    "this degeneracy may or may not be lifted , depending on the local environment : it is in the sr crystal , but it survives in the hc crystal .",
    "in addition , in the crystal lattice the number of optic modes increases with the number of particles in the unit cell , which increases in oder to accommodate @xmath164 unequal 1 density ratios : hence an additional degenerate gap frequency in the hc crystal .",
    "this latter is the `` invariant mode '' whose gap frequency is independent of the mass of the lower density component , which remains inert in this mode .",
    "the mode does not have an equivalent in the liquid .",
    "the other , `` normal '' mode does re - appear in the liquid , with the gap frequency in the vicinity of the crystal equivalent ( for the hc ) or between the longitudinal and transverse gaps ( in the sr ) .",
    "it should be emphasized though that the approximation of the liquid dispersion by angle averaging the lattice phonons is not equivalent to the qlca .",
    "this difference was already demonstrated for the yocp : here it is much more pronounced .",
    "the gap frequencies are not related to the vaa . in the liquid",
    "they can be expressed in terms of the nominal einstein frequencies @xmath72 ( eq . [ eq : qopt ] ) and thus they follow the `` parallel connection '' rule .    in the liquid state one",
    "can identify two upper ( @xmath232 ) and lower ( @xmath233 ) einstein frequencies .",
    "[ eq : einf ] ) for high @xmath60 values the two `` acoustic '' ( longitudinal and transverse ) modes of the liquid merge into @xmath233 , while the two optic modes merge into @xmath232 .",
    "these latter can not be directly identified in the crystal lattice , but they appear in the expressions for its gap frequencies , showing a good agreement with the qlca calculated liquid @xmath232 and @xmath233 quantities .    according to the md simulation result ( fig . [",
    "fig : mdqlca ] ) the slopes in the vicinity of @xmath17 of the longitudinal acoustic and longitudinal optic modes match and the two modes fuse into a single acoustic mode . there is no indication of this phenomenon within the qlca formalism .    as to the dependence on the screening constant @xmath1 ,",
    "we see ( fig . [ fig : hckappa ] ) that the qualitative features of the dispersion remain unaffected over a wide range of @xmath1 values , down to and including the @xmath208 coulomb limit .",
    "a number of problems relating to the collective dynamics of the system have been identified , but have not been studied in this paper : the damping of the modes , the detailed structures and the link between the various fluctuation spectra , the nature of the underlying order in the liquid phase , lattice stability and structures , etc .",
