    "high-@xmath2 jet production and other hard processes are considered as the promising tools for studying properties of hot matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "the challenging problem is the behaviour of colour charge in quark - gluon environment associated with the coherence pattern of the medium - induced radiation .",
    "it results in interesting non - linear phenomena , in particular , the dependence of radiative energy loss per unit distance @xmath3 along the total distance traversed ( see review  @xcite and references therein ) . in a number of papers  @xcite authors analysed the azimuthal anisotropy of high-@xmath2 hadron spectra in semi - central nuclear collisions at rhic due to partonic energy loss in azimuthally non - symmetric volume of quark - gluon plasma . at lhc energy , when the inclusive cross section for hard jet production on @xmath4 gev scale is large enough to study the impact parameter dependence of such processes  @xcite , one can hope to observe the similar effect for hadronic jet itself  @xcite .",
    "in particular , cms experiment at lhc  @xcite will be able to provide jet reconstruction and adequate measurement of impact parameter of nuclear collision using calorimetric information  @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the coherent landau - pomeranchuk - migdal radiation induces a strong dependence of the radiative energy loss of a jet ( but not a leading parton ) on the jet angular cone size  @xcite .",
    "it means that the medium - induced radiation will , in the first place , soften particle energy distributions inside the jet , increase the multiplicity of secondary particles , and to a lesser degree affect the total jet energy . on the other hand ,",
    "collisional energy loss turns out to be practically independent of jet cone size , because the bulk of `` thermal '' particles knocked out of the dense matter by elastic scatterings fly away in almost transverse direction relative to the jet axis  @xcite .",
    "the methodical advantage of azimuthal jet observables is obvious : one needs to reconstruct only azimuthal position of jet , but not the total jet energy .",
    "it can be done more easily and with high accuracy , while the reconstruction of the jet energy is more ambiguous task  @xcite .",
    "however the performance of inclusive analysis of jet production as a function of azimuthal angle requires event - by - event measurement of the reaction plane angle .",
    "the summarized in papers  @xcite present methods for determination of the reaction plane angle are applicable for studying anisotropic flow of soft and semi - hard particles in current heavy ion dedicated experiments at sps  @xcite and rhic  @xcite , and , in principle , might be also used at lhc  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we suggest a method to calculate the coefficient of jet azimuthal anisotropy without reconstruction of nuclear reaction plane . in some sense , it represents the development and generalization of the well - known method for measuring azimuthal anisotropy of particle flow considered originally in a number of works ( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "using eq . ( [ v2 ^ 2_part ] ) and intermediate result in eq .",
    "( [ cor ] ) ( after averaging over particles @xmath19 reduces to @xmath20 ) we derive the formula for computing absolute value of the coefficient of jet azimuthal anisotropy ( without reconstruction of sign of @xmath15 ) : @xmath21 this formula does not require the direct determination of reaction plane angle @xmath6 .",
    "the brackets @xmath22 represent the averaging over particles ( not incorporated in the jet ) in a given event , while the brackets @xmath23 the averaging over events .",
    "the formula ( [ u2_event ] ) can be generalized by introducing as weights the particle momenta , @xmath24 in this case the brackets @xmath22 denote the averaging over angles and transverse momenta of particles .",
    "the other modification of ( [ u2(p)_event ] ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26  being energy deposition in calorimetric ring @xmath27 of position @xmath28 ) allows one using calorimetric measurements ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) for the determination of jet azimuthal anisotropy , in particular , under condition of cms experiment at lhc .",
    "in order to illustrate the applicability of method presented for real physical situation , we consider the following model .    [ [ jets . ] ] jets .",
    "+ + + + +    the initial jet distributions in nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions at @xmath29 tev have been generated using pytha@xmath30 generator  @xcite .",
    "we simulated the rescattering and energy loss of jets in gluon - dominated plasma , created initially in nuclear overlap zone in pb@xmath31pb collisions at different impact parameters .",
    "for details of this model one can refer to our previous papers  @xcite . essentially for our consideration here",
    "is that in non - central collisions the azimuthal distribution of jets is approximated well by the elliptic form ( [ phi_jet ] ) . in the model",
    "the coefficient of jet azimuthal anisotropy increases almost linearly with the growth of impact parameter @xmath32 and becomes maximum at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the nucleus radius . after that @xmath35 drops rapidly with increasing @xmath32 : this is the domain of impact parameter values , where the effect of decreasing energy loss due to reducing effective transverse size of the dense zone and initial energy density of the medium is crucial and not compensated more by stronger non - symmetry of the volume ) .",
    "other important feature is that the jet azimuthal anisotropy decreases with increasing jet energy , because the energy dependence of medium - induced loss is rather weak .",
    "finally , the kinematical cuts on jet transverse energy and rapidity has been applied : @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 . after this dijet event",
    "is superimposed on pb@xmath31pb event containing anisotropic flow .",
    "[ [ particle - flow . ] ] particle flow .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    anisotropic flow data at rhic  @xcite can be described well by hydrodynamical models for semi - central collisions and @xmath2 up to @xmath38 gev / c  @xcite , while the majority of microscopical monte - carlo models underestimate flow effects ( however , see  @xcite ) .",
    "one can expect that the hydrodynamical model can be applied to estimation of particle flow effects at lhc , may be extending this approach to even higher p@xmath13 values . on the other hand , at collider energies one more reason for anisotropic flow in relatively high - p@xmath13 domain can arise : the sensitivity of semi - hard particles to the azimuthal asymmetry of reaction volume under the condition that the major part of them are the products of in - medium radiated gluons or parent hard partons  @xcite .",
    "of course , for more detailed simulation , one has to take into account the interplay between hydro flow and semi - hard particle flow .",
    "however here we restrict our consideration to using the simple hydrodynamical monte - carlo code  @xcite giving hadron ( charged and neutral pion , kaon and proton ) spectrum as a superposition of the thermal distribution and collective flow .",
    "for the fixed in the model `` freeze - out '' parameters  temperature @xmath39 mev , collective longitudinal rapidity @xmath40 and collective transverse rapidity @xmath41  we get average hadron transverse momentum @xmath42 gev / c .",
    "we set the poisson multiplicity distribution and take into account the impact parameter dependence of multiplicity in a simple way , just suggesting that the mean multiplicity of particles is proportional to the nuclear overlap function   ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if the particle density in central collisions is fixed as a parameter , we are getting here the most `` pessimistic '' , minimal estimation of mean multiplicity of non - central events .",
    "since the accuracy of the method used improves with the increasing multiplicity , for weaker @xmath32-dependences one can obtain even better resolution for @xmath15 .",
    "] , @xmath43 . in the framework of this model , anisotropic flow",
    "can be introduced on the assumption that the spatial ellipticity of `` freeze - out '' region , @xmath44 is directly related to the initial spatial ellipticity of nuclear overlap zone , @xmath45 .",
    "such `` scaling '' allows one to avoid using additional parameters and , at the same time , results in introducing elliptic anisotropy of particle and energy flow due to dependence of effective transverse size of `` freeze - out '' region @xmath46 on azimuthal angle of `` hadronic liquid '' element @xmath47 : @xmath48 obtained in such a way azimuthal distribution of particles is described well by the elliptic form ( [ phi_part ] ) for the domain of reasonable impact parameter values . note that in the framework of present paper we do not aim at detailed description of azimuthal hadronic spectra and its comparison with experimental data ( in principle , fit of the data could be performed using , for example , @xmath49 in ( [ r_f ] ) as a parameter ) . in order to investigate the reliability of the method",
    ", we just need here to introduce the elliptic anisotropy of energy flow in monte - carlo event generator .",
    "[ [ energy - flow . ] ] energy flow .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    to be specified , we consider the example of cms detector at lhc collider  @xcite .",
    "the central ( `` barrel '' ) part of the cms calorimetric system will cover the pseudo - rapidity region @xmath50 , the segmentation of electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters being @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively  @xcite . in order roughly to reproduce the real experimental situation ( not including real detector effects , but just assuming calorimeter hermeticity ) , we apply formula ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) to integrated over rapidity energy deposition @xmath53 of generated particles in @xmath54 rings ( according to the number of rings in the hadron calorimeter ) covering full azimuth .",
    "[ [ section ] ] +    figure 1 shows the @xmath32-dependence of `` theoretical '' value of @xmath15 ( calculated including collisional and radiative energy loss ) , and @xmath15 determined by the method ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) for the two estimated values of the input parameter , number of charged particles per unit rapidity at @xmath55 in central pb@xmath31pb collisions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "one can see that the accuracy of @xmath15 determination is close to @xmath58 for semi - central collisions and becomes significantly worse in very peripheral collisions ( @xmath59 ) , when decreasing multiplicity and azimuthal anisotropy of the event results in large relative fluctuations of energy deposition in a ring  .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us discuss the influence of different factors on results for @xmath15 determined with the present method .",
    "first of all , note that the theoretical absolute value of @xmath15 and its @xmath32-distribution are , of course , very model - dependent .",
    "for example , the effect of jet energy loss and corresponding azimuthal anisotropy are sensitive to the defined jet cone size  @xcite . since we obtained here the energy loss only on the partonic level , for the finite jet cone size @xmath60 the effect should be less pronounced .",
    "another reason for reducing jet azimuthal anisotropy can be sharp transverse collective expansion in events with large impact parameter values   gev / c under rhic conditions ) may drop below the observable level . in principle , this effect can have influence also on _ jet _ anisotropy at lhc conditions .",
    "let us just mention that the possibility for realization of such scenario for transverse expansion is not obvious . within original bjorken approach  @xcite the rarefaction wave front moves with the sound velocity @xmath61 and the whole volume of",
    "the fluid appears to be involved in three - dimensional expansion in the time of order @xmath62 . ]",
    "however , the relative accuracy of @xmath15 determination does not show any significant dependence on its absolute value .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the relative error for the method ( [ u2_event ] ) using particle flow can be roughly estimated as a sum of two terms , which are proportional to @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively ( @xmath65 is the coefficient of particle azimuthal anisotropy and @xmath66 is the mean multiplicity in the event ) .",
    "if the number of events is large enough , @xmath67 , the main influence would be expected due to the second term , which does not depend on @xmath15 .",
    "this is also the reason why the relative error becomes significant at low values of both the coefficient of particle azimuthal anisotropy and the particle multiplicity .",
    "the same conclusion will be valid for the method ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) using energy flow , if the condition @xmath68 is fulfilled .",
    "let us also note that in a real experimental situation , the pattern of azimuthal anisotropy can be more complicated due to non - flow correlations , finite accuracy of impact parameter determination , detector resolution effects , etc . on the other hand , one can try to improve accuracy of this technique considering , for example , the correlation between two equal multiplicity sub - events  @xcite , or using results of work  @xcite .",
    "the strong interest is springing up to the azimuthal correlation measurements in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the rescattering and energy loss of hard partons in azimuthally non - symmetric volume of dense quark - gluon matter can result in visible azimuthal anisotropy of high-@xmath2 hadrons at rhic and high-@xmath69 jets at lhc .    in jet case ,",
    "the methodical advantage of azimuthal observables is that one needs to reconstruct only azimuthal position of jet without measuring total jet energy .",
    "one of the ways to perform the inclusive analysis of jet production as a function of azimuthal angle is event - by - event determination of the nuclear reaction plane angle . in the present paper",
    "we suggest the method for measurement of jet azimuthal anisotropy coefficients without reconstruction of the event plane .",
    "this technique is based on the calculation of correlations between the azimuthal position of jet axis and the angles of particles ( not incorporated in the jet ) , azimuthal distribution of jets being described by the elliptic form .",
    "the method is generalized by introducing as weights the particle momenta or energy deposition in the calorimetric rings . in the latter case",
    ", we have illustrated the reliability of the present method in real physical situation under lhc conditions .",
    "the accuracy of the method improves with increasing multiplicity and particle ( energy ) flow azimuthal anisotropy , and is practically independent of the absolute values of azimuthal anisotropy of the jet itself .",
