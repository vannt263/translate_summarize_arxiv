    "more quantum defects must be found by extrapolation for the triplet series , as the spectroscopic data is less complete .",
    "alternatively , the disagreement may reflect the fact that the single electron model ignores the mixing between the singlet and triplet states .",
    "we have shown that a single electron model can be used to calculate dipole matrix elements for strontium , over a large range of @xmath47 .",
    "the single electron model is therefore appropriate for calculating the dipole - dipole interactions , which depend on these matrix elements @xcite .",

    "rather than relying on spontaneous ionization , we can detect the rydberg atoms using autoionization by exciting the inner valence electron .",
    "if an atom is initially prepared in a rydberg state , the inner valence electron can be excited independently , a process known as isolated core excitation @xcite .",
    "the doubly excited states couple not only to each other ( as with singly excited states ) , but also to the degenerate continuum . for states of low angular momentum @xmath1",
    "this leads to rapid ionization , and these states are referred to as `` autoionizing '' .",
    "there has been much research into the nature of autoionizing resonances , with mqdt proving to be extremely powerful for describing doubly excited states @xcite .",
    "the autoionization process has a large cross - section , and hence produces significantly more ions than spontaneous ionization .",
    "we typically find that by exciting an autoionizing resonance the signal is increased by a factor of 100 .",
