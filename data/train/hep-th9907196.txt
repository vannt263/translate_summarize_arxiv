    "this fact indicates the absence of anomalies in such representation .",
    "analogous result was obtained in work @xcite , which shows , that quantum theory of open string in pseudo - euclidean space with equal number of spatial and temporal directions ( particularly , @xmath3 ) can be realized in positively defined extended space of states without anomalies in group of reparametrizations .",
    "consideration of string theory in covariant approach is related with one difficulty .",
    "it is shown in a recent work @xcite that the phase space of covariant string theory is much wider than it is usually assumed .",

    "consistent exclusion of tachionic solutions is possible only in non - covariant approach , when one chooses a special parametrization of the world sheet .",
    "standard parametrization , used in non - covariant approach is _ light cone gauge_. this parametrization can be obtained in slicing of the world sheet by a set of parallel planes , where one is tangent to light cone with a center in the origin ( ) .",
    "usually the position of such planes is `` frozen '' in the space - time , i.e. lorentz transformations change the location of the world sheet with respect to the slicing planes . as a result ,",
    "lorentz transformations change the slices on the world sheet , i.e. are followed by reparametrization . in this way",

    "another technically difficult task is an introduction of hermitian structure in this space of states .",
    "it is known @xcite , that in theories with non - compact gauge group the scalar product from extended space of states is divergent on physical subspace , selected by constraints ( it includes an infinite volume of gauge group ) .",

    "it was noted in the previous section , that the function @xmath82 is action - type variable , generating @xmath7-periodical evolution .",

    "the gauge introduced here is quite similar to the time - like gauge proposed by rohrlich @xcite , used also in works [ 7 - 9 ] , an important difference : the rohrlich s gauge , except of @xmath93 , also supposes @xmath94 .",
    "this additional constraint does not commute with @xmath86 ( rohrlich s gauge fixes parametrization on equal time slice  our approach preserves this freedom ) . as a result , the whole set of constraints , appearing instead of ( [ con2 ] ) ,",
