    "observations of comic rays have been greatly developed . after a series of cosmic - ray measurements ,",
    "pamela recently published the first result of the positron fraction , which show an excess compared to the background at energies above 10gev @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the atic collaboration also reported an excess of the electron plus position flux in a range of @xmath0gev @xcite .",
    "although the experimental data and the background estimations still involve ambiguities , the excesses may be a sign of the dark matter ( dm ) . in this letter , we focus on decaying dm scenarios .",
    "the dm is not always required to be stable as long as its life time is long enough for the dm to survive until today .",
    "then , its decay products are a possible source of the energetic cosmic rays .",
    "it is non - trivial to realize such a long - lived particle .",
    "actually , decay operators must be incredibly suppressed for the models to be viable . a well - motivated candidate of the dm",
    "is known to be the gravitino with a broken r - parity .",
    "this is because its decay is doubly suppressed by the planck scale and r - parity violations @xcite .",
    "even with the planck suppression , the r - parity violation is limited to be very tiny and looks unnatural unless some mechanisms are taken into account . as a solution of the fine - tuning",
    ", we propose a r - parity violation introduced in the right - handed neutrino sector .",
    "then , the violation is suppressed in the low - energy scale by a see - saw mechanism .",
    "actually , since the violation appears in low - energy phenomena though the right - handed neutrino , its effect becomes suppressed by the right - handed neutrino mass scale .",
    "we will show that the pamela / atic excesses are explained for @xmath1gev without a parameter tuning .",
    "this type of the r - parity violation does not only explain the pamela / atic anomalies , but also opens a window for the successful thermal leptogenesis @xcite especially in a large gravitino mass region .",
    "indeed , the mechanism is an attractive and elegant solution to the mystery of the baryon asymmetry of the universe , though it usually requires a relatively high reheating temperature , @xmath2gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in such a high reheating temperature ,",
    "the severest cosmological constraints are provided by the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the overclosure of the universe .",
    "the former constraint is due to a prolonged decay of the next - to - lightest superparticle ( nlsp ) into the gravitino lightest superparticle ( lsp ) .",
    "in contrast , the nlsp can decay into the standard model ( sm ) particles much more efficiently through the r - parity violating operator .",
    "thus , the bbn bound becomes ameliorated @xcite .",
    "the overclosure constraint then puts a constraint on the reheating temperature .",
    "in particular , the thermal gravitino production is enhanced in a larger soft mass region . according to pamela / atic ,",
    "the cosmic - ray excesses imply a heavy gravitino , namely large superparticle masses .",
    "we will see that the leptogenesis temperature is unlikely to be satisfied for @xmath3tev unless the gluino mass parameter is relatively small at the gut scale .",
    "nevertheless , since the r - parity violation in this letter contributes to a cp - asymmetric right - handed neutrino decay @xcite , the thermal leptogenesis will be shown to work to explain the observed baryon asymmetry easily .",
    "thus , we will study the r - parity violating scenario in the right - handed neutrino sector as an attractive framework of the decaying gravitino dm .",
    "let us consider the gravitino dm scenario with a decay due to r - parity violations .",
    "a spectrum of the cosmic rays from its decay products are determined by the type of the r - parity violating operator , the gravitino mass and its life time . in a case of the bilinear r - parity violation ,",
    "the dominant decay channels are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the decay is parametrized by the sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vev ) . with the operator , @xmath8 ,",
    "it becomes @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the left - handed lepton and up - type higgs , respectively .",
    "the parameters are the higgsino mass @xmath12 , the higgs vev @xmath13gev , the higgs vev ratio @xmath14 , and the sneutrino soft mass @xmath15 .",
    "then , the gravitino life time is estimated as @xmath16 for @xmath17gev , where @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 which leads to the r - parity violation parameter as @xmath20 this @xmath18 satisfies with the other cosmological constraints @xcite",
    ". the gravitino survives until today as @xmath21 for @xmath22gev , and the parameter is small enough to avoid the wash - out of the lepton / baryon asymmetry since @xmath23 is satisfied .",
    "furthermore , the bbn constraint is solved for @xmath24 by virtue of the r - parity violation , and the r - parity violating contribution with @xmath23 is negligible for the neutrino mass .",
    "we assume that the neutrino mass is obtained by the see - saw mechanism in this letter .",
    "however , from the naturalness point of view , the violation is too tiny and must be fine - tuned .",
    "we propose a simple framework to realize this tiny r - parity violation .",
    "we introduce the following r - parity violating operator in the right - handed neutrino sector , @xmath25 accompanied by the right - handed neutrino mass and the yukawa terms , @xmath26 , after decoupling the heavy right - handed neutrino , we obtain the effective r - parity violating operators in low - energy scale : @xmath27 it is noticed that the r - parity violating effects appear with @xmath28 because they contribute through the right - handed neutrino .",
    "thus , the r - parity violating effects are naturally suppressed by the see - saw mechanism .    taking the higgs vevs , ( [ eq : low - rhnu - rpv ] )",
    "behaves as a bilinear r - parity violating operator . actually , combined with the @xmath12 term and the sneutrino soft mass ,",
    "the sneutrino acquires vev as @xmath29 then , @xmath18 is estimated to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a typical scale of the light neutrino masses defined as @xmath32 . here , we omitted flavor indices .",
    "as a result , we find that the gravitino life time @xmath33sec required from pamela / atic is realized for @xmath34 and @xmath1gev .",
    "we want to emphasize that there is no fine - tuning in the r - parity violating parameters .",
    "the gravitino decay is almost the same as that by the bilinear r - parity violation .",
    "in fact , it is dominantly induced by the sneutrino vev ( [ eq : snuvev ] ) , while the other decaying channels from ( [ eq : low - rhnu - rpv ] ) are subdominant .",
    "although @xmath35 is also derived from ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) , the resultant decay operators are negligible for the cosmic ray spectra .    according to the current cosmic - ray data , the positron spectrum has a steep rise in high - energy region .",
    "this behavior prefers the gravitino dm decaying direct into the positron or anti - muon @xcite .",
    "the decay product is determined by flavour structure of the sneutrino vev . denoting the flavour indexes explicitly in ( [ eq : snuvev ] )",
    ", @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath37 with respect to the flavor structure , where @xmath38 is the index of the heavy neutrino and @xmath39 for the light one .",
    "thus , it is not surprising to expect the positron and anti - muon to be produced in the decay .",
    "consequently , the r - parity violating operator ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) can naturally explain the current pamela / atic excesses with @xmath40gev .",
    "let us comment on radiative corrections with the r - parity violation ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) .",
    "they induce a linear term of the right - handed neutrino in the khler potential .",
    "this then leads to the right - handed sneutrino vev in the framework of the supergravity .",
    "although this can give a similar contribution to the effective r - parity violating operators ( [ eq : low - rhnu - rpv ] ) , the results in this letter do not change qualitatively .",
    "thus , we will neglect it hereafter",
    ".    we may also have the r - parity violating operators in the right - handed neutrino sector other than ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) such as the superpotential terms , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , their couplings are required to be suppressed since they can induce too large r - parity violations through the right - handed sneutrino vev within the supergravity .",
    "thus , we consider that the operators are forbidden by ( discrete ) symmetries .    in the above , we focused on the susy invariant operators for the r - parity violations . apart from them",
    ", we may have the violations in the susy breaking term .",
    "it can be noticed that the analysis is similar to the above , and the result is almost the same .",
    "in the decaying gravitino dm scenario , the cosmological constraint comes from the overclosure of the universe .",
    "actually , the gravitino is thermally produced in the hot plasma . at the leading order ,",
    "the relic abundance is evaluated as @xmath43 where the definition of the parameters are found in @xcite . in the numerical analysis",
    ", we include the electroweak contributions , which can be sizable especially when the gluino mass parameter is rather small compared to the bino and wino ones at the gut ( namely @xmath44 ) scale .",
    "it should be mentioned that the gravitino production rate includes an @xmath45 uncertainty from unknown higher order contributions and nonperturbative effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , resummation of thermal masses potentially increases the rate by about a factor of two @xcite .",
    "since the massive gravitino behaves as a cold dark matter , its abundance is constrained from the measurements . according to the wmap 5-year data",
    ", the abundance is required to satisfy @xcite , @xmath46 at the 2@xmath47 level .",
    "thus , provided the gaugino and gravitino masses , we obtain an upper bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "it is interesting to study the overclosure bound in terms of the superparticle masses at the weak scale , which are expected to be measured by lhc . from ( [ eq : gravitino - abundance ] ) we notice that the gravitino production is evaluated with the parameters at the reheating temperature scale .",
    "then , they are correlated with those at the weak scale by solving the renormalization group equations .",
    "let us mention that the 1-loop result includes large uncertainties especially in the colored sector : 2-loop contributions can give an @xmath48% correction , and the renormalization scale at the 1-loop level potentially contains additional @xmath48% uncertinty , which is reduced by taking the higher order corrections into account .",
    "noting that ( [ eq : gravitino - abundance ] ) includes the gluino mass squared , the thermal gravitino abundance can change drastically .",
    "actually , @xmath49 is found to be almost as twice as the previous 1-loop analyses for @xmath50 with the gluino mass fixed at the weak scale @xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) . in the following numerical analysis",
    ", we evolve the renormalization group running at the 2-loop accuracy and include the 1-loop threshold corrections by means of softsusy 2.0.18 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] , we plot the maximal reheating temperature allowed by the overclosure bound with varying the gluino mass @xmath51 compared to the gaugino mass @xmath52 at the gut scale . here , the bino and wino masses are set to be equal @xmath53 and realize the nlsp mass @xmath54 on each solid lines . since the universal soft scalar mass @xmath55 except for the higgs ones is chosen to be @xmath56 , the bino - like neutralino is the nlsp , while the higgs mass squareds are assumed to be @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the electroweak symmetry breaking to give arise especially in a large @xmath55 region .",
    "the scalar trilinear couplings , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , though they are irrelevant for the maximal reheating temperature .",
    "the gravitino mass is relevant for the upper bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "we assumed that it is equal to the nlsp mass .",
    "this turns out to maximize @xmath44 for @xmath63 .",
    "although the possible maximal temperature is obtained by a smaller gravitino mass for a lighter gluino region , the difference of @xmath44 is less than 10% even for @xmath64 .",
    "it is commented that the gluino can become the nlsp for @xmath65 .",
    "we find that the maximal reheating temperature can be as large as @xmath66gev in a large parameter region , while @xmath67gev is realized for a smaller nlsp mass , e.g. @xmath68gev for the universal gaugino mass @xmath69 .",
    "this is because the thermal gravitino abundance ( [ eq : gravitino - abundance ] ) increases as the soft mass scale is larger . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] , we see that @xmath70gev leads to @xmath71tev for @xmath72 ( see @xcite for a hierarchical gaugino mass case ) .",
    "according to pamela , the gravitino mass is indicated as @xmath73gev , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath74gev .",
    "then , it is easy to obtain the leptogenesis temperature in a wide class of models ( see @xcite , in which discussions of superparticle mass spectrum are also explored ) .",
    "in contrast , the atic result implies a larger gravitino mass , @xmath3tev .",
    "then , the gluino mass is required to be suppressed .",
    "for instance , when the gravitino mass is 1tev , @xmath70gev needs @xmath75 at the gut scale , and @xmath76 for @xmath77tev .",
    "thus , the susy breaking models become specified to realize the leptogenesis temperature .",
    "a lighter gluino mass parameter is favored at the gut scale , and thus a mass spectrum of the superparticles tends to degenerate at the weak scale especially when the gravitino mass is heavier.tev .",
    "thus , the gravitino is not the lsp . ] on the other hand , the universal gaugino mass models look inconsistent with the thermal leptogenesis in the light of the atic result , though the usual gauge- and many gravity - mediation models have this feature .",
    "thus , we will revisit the thermal leptogenesis in the next section in the presence of the r - parity violation .    before proceeding to the next section ,",
    "let us comment on the other parameter dependence . in the analysis",
    ", we take @xmath56 at the gut scale . for tiny @xmath55",
    ", the stau can be the nlsp .",
    "then , the upper constraint in fig .  [ fig : tr ] becomes severer for fixed @xmath54 , since the gaugino masses increase .",
    "thus , the model parameters discussed above are limited more severely .",
    "is given at the gut scale , and the soft scalar masses are chosen to be @xmath56 with @xmath78 at the gut scale . then , the bino - like neutralino is the nlsp for @xmath79 .",
    "see the text for the other irrelevant parameters . ]",
    "we now revisit the thermal leptogenesis in the presence of the r - parity violating operator ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) . in the above",
    ", we found that a gluino mass is bounded from above to realize the leptogenesis temperature @xmath2gev in a large gravitino mass region .",
    "in particular , the universal gaugino mass models are inconsistent with the temperature if we take the atic result .",
    "on the other hand , we have introduced the r - parity violating operator in the right - handed neutrino sector .",
    "we will see that a cp asymmetry of the decay of the right - handed neutrino is enhanced by the violation @xcite , and thus the leptogenesis mechanism works successfully .    in the thermal leptogenesis ,",
    "the baryon density relative to the photon density becomes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath80 which is compared to the observation @xcite , @xmath81 here and hereafter , we assume the hierarchical right - handed neutrinos and ignore the flavour effects which does not affect the lower bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath82 represents effects of washout and scattering processes , which is obtained by solving the boltzmann equations . for the case of zero initial abundance of the right - handed neutrinos",
    ", its maximal value is known to be @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the cp asymmetry @xmath84 in the decay of the lightest right - handed neutrino , @xmath85 , is determined by the structure of the neutrino sector . with @xmath86",
    "the observed baryon asymmetry requires @xmath87 in the r - parity preserved models , it is known that the @xmath88 has an upper bound as @xcite @xmath89 due to the see - saw relation . here",
    "@xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) are the mass eigenvalues of the light neutrinos , and @xmath92 is the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath93 . using the atmospheric neutrino mass",
    "squared difference @xmath94 , the lower bound on the right - handed neutrino mass becomes @xmath95 with the 3@xmath47 values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , the corresponding lower bound on the reheating temperature is obtained as @xmath98 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath88 ( [ eq : maxeps1 ] ) can be relaxed by the r - parity violating operator ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) .",
    "the operator contributes to the cp asymmetric decay , @xmath85 , via the diagrams exchanging @xmath11 and @xmath99 ( and @xmath41 ) in the loop . in addition , a decay , @xmath100 , gives arise with the r - parity violating operator of @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , we obatin @xcite @xmath101\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the loop function is @xmath102 .",
    "we notice that the result depends on @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in order to avoid a strong washout by a ( inverse ) decay ,",
    "@xmath103 is favored to satisfy @xmath105 , while @xmath106 is allowed to be @xmath45 .",
    "then , the r - parity violating processes can dominate the cp asymmetry of the right - handed neutrino decay . actually , it is estimated as @xmath107    \\nonumber \\\\    & &    \\times     \\left ( \\frac{m_{n1}}{10 ^ 8{\\rm gev } } \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 } }    \\left ( \\frac{m_{ni}/m_{n1}}{10 } \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }    \\left ( \\frac{\\tilde m_1}{10^{-3}{\\rm ev } } \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }    \\left ( \\frac{\\bar m'_\\nu}{0.1{\\rm ev } } \\right )    \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\beta } ,    \\label{eq : eps1rpv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath108 . here , the parameters are defined as @xmath109 , @xmath110 v^2   /m_{n1}$ ] and @xmath111 .",
    "we can see that the result exceeds the upper bound ( [ eq : maxeps1 ] ) for @xmath112 and @xmath105 , i.e. @xmath113 .    in the last section , we found that @xmath114gev is obtained even in a heavy nlsp mass region from fig .  [ fig : tr ] . on the other hand",
    ", we saw in this section that the cp asymmetry of the right - handed neutrino can be drastically enhanced by the r - parity violating operator ( [ eq : rhnu - rpv ] ) , and the condition ( [ eq : eps1min ] ) is easily satisfied , e.g. for @xmath115gev .",
    "since @xmath93 is expected to be produced sufficiently in the thermal bath once @xmath44 exceeds @xmath92 , the thermal leptogenesis consequently works in a wide class of models with explaining the cosmic - ray anomalies from pamela / atic . to be explicit ,",
    "let us give an example : @xmath116 with the lightest right - handed neutrino mass @xmath117gev and @xmath118 .",
    "one may be worried that such a large r - parity violation enhances washout effects .",
    "the ( inverse ) decay and @xmath119 processes indeed receive additional contributions from the r - parity violating operator . considering that they are controlled by the washout mass parameter , @xmath120",
    ", we notice that the extra effects just redefine @xmath121 as the new one given in the previous paragraph . on the other hand",
    ", the r - parity violation can enhance the @xmath122 washout .",
    "actually , we obtain @xmath123 ( @xmath11 means @xmath11 or @xmath99 ) by exchanging a heavier right - handed neutrino in the diagram . since the diagram is almost the same as the r - parity preserved one except for a coupling and corresponding field , the additional contribution is roughly estimated as @xmath124 where @xmath125 represents the @xmath122 washout term with a subtraction of the resonance @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath126 becomes larger than @xmath125 for @xmath127gev .",
    "since @xmath125 is negligibly small for this @xmath92 , we can numerically check that the washout is dominated by the ( inverse ) decay and @xmath119 scattering even for @xmath128 ( see e.g. @xcite for the numerical estimations of the washout terms in the r - parity preserved case ) .",
    "although @xmath125 increase as @xmath92 grows , @xmath126 decreases at the same time .",
    "thus , the r - parity violating contribution does not change the result .",
    "the gravitino dm scenario is an attractive candidate to explain the pamela / atic excesses .",
    "however , the r - parity violation has to be tightly suppressed in the low - energy scale . in this letter",
    ", we proposed a framework of the r - parity violation to solve the fine - tuning . introducing the violation in the right - handed neutrino sector ,",
    "the effects are naturally suppressed in the low - energy scale by the see - saw mechanism .",
    "we found that the life time required by pamela / atic , @xmath129sec , is obtained by the r - parity violating operator @xmath130 with @xmath34 for @xmath131gev .",
    "the r - parity violation not only provides a well source of the cosmic rays to explain the pamela / atic anomalies , but also opens a window for the thermal leptogenesis . in the presence of the r - parity violation",
    ", the reheating temperature is bounded from above by the overclosure bound due to the thermal gravitino production .",
    "we found that @xmath2gev is accessible for @xmath132gev , while @xmath133tev favored by atic restricts the gluino mass to be suppressed for @xmath134gev .",
    "nonetheless , the leptogenesis was shown to work , since the r - parity violating interactions in the right - handed neutrino sector enhances the cp asymmetric right - handed decay .",
    "therefore , the gravitino lsp with the r - parity violation in the right - handed neutrino sector is a nice candidate of the decaying dm scenarios .",
    "it is worthwhile to clarify the parameter dependence of the phenomena .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectra are sensitive to larger @xmath135 and corresponding @xmath136 but insensitive to @xmath92 as long as @xmath137 , while the lightest right - handed neutrino determines the thermal leptogenesis , _",
    "i.e. _ the baryon asymmetry depends on @xmath92 . from ( [ eq : eps1rpv ] ) it is possible to lower @xmath92 as well as the reheating temperature required by the thermal leptogenesis , though too small @xmath92 needs tiny @xmath103 to avoid a strong washout .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectra of the anti - matter and photon also depends on the r - parity violation . in this letter ,",

    ", we may distinguish the r - parity violating operators .",
    "furthermore , since the r - parity violating operator can be embedded in a high - scale models such as su(5 ) gut and heterotic string models , combining with the future collider data we might be able to study physics in high - energy scale .",
