    "the observational result that high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorption systems appear not to cluster strongly in redshift ( e.g. sargent 1980 ) has driven most discussion about the origin of the ly @xmath0  forest .",
    "this result has generally been interpreted as evidence that high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers arise in intergalactic clouds rather than in galaxies .",
    "recent studies of the relationship between ly @xmath0  absorbers and galaxies at redshifts @xmath5 , however , directly demonstrate that many or most low - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers ( or at least those satisfying @xmath6 ) arise in galaxies rather than in intergalactic clouds ( lanzetta 1995 ) .",
    "why is it that ly @xmath0  absorbers appear not to cluster strongly in redshift whereas low - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers appear to arise in galaxies ?",
    "one suggestion is that there exist two distinct populations of ly @xmath0absorbers : a rapidly evolving , unclustered , intergalactic population that dominates at high redshifts , and a slowly evolving , clustered , galactic population that dominates at low redshifts ( e.g. bahcall 1995 ) .",
    "another possibility is that previous measurements of the high - redshift ly @xmath0  two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) have underestimated the actual clustering of the absorbers  presumably due to unresolved blending of overlapping velocity components  and ly @xmath0  absorbers arise in galaxies at all epochs .    here",
    "we examine the second of these possibilities , that previous measurements of the high - redshift ly @xmath0  tpcf have underestimated the actual clustering of the absorbers , using new observations of very weak civ absorption lines associated with high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers ( cowie 1995 , hereafter cskh ) ,  2 .",
    "these very weak civ absorption lines trace small - scale velocity structure that can not be resolved by ly @xmath0  absorption lines because ( 1 )  the atomic weight of c is 12 times the one of h , so the thermal broadening of civ absorption lines is 3.5 times smaller than that of ly @xmath0  lines , and ( 2 )  civ absorption lines suffer far less saturation because of the difference in column densities .",
    "we show that the civ lines indeed help to reveal the underlying velocity correlation of the ly @xmath0  systems , and that this same velocity structure is blended away in the ly @xmath0  data ,  3 .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of the derived velocity clustering of the ly @xmath0  absorbers with that of galaxies at the present epoch , ",
    "the observations by cskh consist of high spectral resolution ( @xmath7 ) , high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath8 per resolution element ) spectra of three qsos obtained with the keck telescope and the hires spectrograph .",
    "the observations generally cover both the ly @xmath0  and the corresponding civ wavelength regions and are sensitive to civ absorption lines arising in civ column densities as low as @xmath9 .    from the observations , cskh selected a complete sample of 38 ly @xmath0  absorption lines satisfying @xmath10 .",
    "they then eliminated seven of these absorption lines due to contamination by unrelated metal absorption lines or lack of coverage of the corresponding civ wavelength region or because the lines produce corresponding lyman - limit absorption ( which indicates @xmath11 ) .",
    "the resulting sample thus contains 31 ly @xmath0  absorption lines satisfying @xmath12 . for each member of this sample , they searched the corresponding civ wavelength region for civ absorption lines and applied a voigt profile fitting procedure to the identified civ absorption lines to measure redshifts , doppler parameters , and column densities .    here",
    "we use the absorption system parameters derived by cskh in their profile analysis , which are summarized in their table 1a .",
    "the average redshift of the absorbers is @xmath13 , the median column density of the absorbers is @xmath14 , and the typical civ / hi ratio of the absorbers is @xmath15 . of the final sample of 31",
    "ly @xmath0absorption lines , 15 are observed to have associated civ absorption , of which six show small - scale velocity structure with between two and nine velocity components per ly @xmath0  absorption line .",
    "our primary assumption is that very weak civ absorption lines trace small - scale velocity structure that can not be resolved by ly @xmath0  absorption lines .",
    "hence the goal of the analysis is to measure the high - redshift ly @xmath0tpcf by using very weak civ absorption lines instead of the ly @xmath0  absorption lines themselves .",
    "to do this we use the results summarized in table 1a of cskh . in cases",
    "where cskh identified one or more civ absorption lines with a single ly @xmath0  absorption line , we use the redshifts of all civ absorption lines in the analysis . in cases where cskh identified no civ absorption lines with a single ly @xmath0absorption line , we use the single redshift of the ly @xmath0  absorption line in the analysis .",
    "this procedure yields a total of 52 absorption redshifts .",
    "we then use these absorption redshifts to construct the ly @xmath0  line tpcf by normalizing the distribution of velocity pairs with respect to an unclustered distribution of redshifts .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 , which plots in the upper panel the high - redshift ly @xmath0  line tpcf as traced by civ absorption lines .",
    "( the error bars shown in figure 1 are based on a modified `` bootstrap '' technique that yields approximately correct results even for correlated data .",
    "details of this technique will be presented elsewhere . )",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that the high - redshift ly @xmath0  tpcf indicates very strong clustering on velocity scales @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore conclude that high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorption systems with @xmath1  are strongly clustered in redshift .",
    "the results of  3.1 demonstrate that high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorption systems with @xmath1  are strongly clustered in redshift , whereas all previous analyses have found that they are either unclustered ( sargent 1980 ) or only very weakly clustered in redshift ( e.g. webb 1987 ; barcons & webb 1991 ) . how are these results compatible ?    to examine this issue",
    ", we apply the standard method of measuring the ly @xmath0tpcf to models of the ly @xmath0  absorption lines observed by cskh .",
    "we first generate a set of ly @xmath0  absorption lines according to the results in table 1a of cskh .",
    "we adopt a constant civ / hi ratio of @xmath17 and assume that the doppler parameters are due to thermal motions , convolve the synthetic absorption lines with the appropriate instrumental response and add noise to match the actual signal - to - noise ratio of the observations .",
    "next , we fit the resulting synthetic spectra using the voigt profile fitting routine described previously by lanzetta & bowen ( 1992 ) . for each absorption line",
    "we add velocity components until the decrease in @xmath18 is smaller than the accompanying decrease in degrees of freedom , @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we construct the ly @xmath0  tpcf according to the procedures described in the previous section , but this time using the fitted redshifts instead of the actual redshifts .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 , which plots in the lower panel the high - redshift ly @xmath0  tpcf as traced by ly @xmath0  absorption lines .",
    "it is clear that the ly @xmath0  absorption lines can not reveal the strong clustering indicated by the civ absorption lines .",
    "the lower panel of figure 1 may be directly compared with the high - redshift ly @xmath0  tpcf presented by hu ( 1995 ) ; both use observations of nearly the same quality , and both obtain practically identical results . note that our stopping criterion for velocity components , @xmath20 purposely allows even marginally significant lines to be included . if no correlation is obtained even with this generous criterion , it certainly will not be found with a more conservative one .",
    "we therefore conclude that previous measurements of the high - redshift ly @xmath0  tpcf have underestimated the actual clustering of the absorbers due to unresolved blending of overlapping velocity components .",
    "the results of the previous section demonstrate that previous measurements of the high - redshift ly @xmath0  tpcf of absorbers with @xmath1  have underestimated the actual clustering of the absorbers .",
    "can this result extend to lower column densities for which blending is presumably weaker ?    to examine this issue , we repeat the analysis described in the previous section for ly @xmath0  lines generated in two different ways . for the first simulation",
    "we assume that the civ doppler parameter @xmath21 is entirely due to thermal motion , so @xmath22 , and reduce the hi column densities by a factor of 100 with respect to the original ones .",
    "an example of just how a voigt profile fit to high spectral resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio observations can underestimate the actual number of velocity components comprising an absorption line is shown in figure 2 , in which panel ( a ) shows the result of synthesizing the complex of lines at @xmath23 toward q0302@xmath24003 ( with hi column densities decreased by a factor of 100 with respect to the original ones ) , panel ( b ) shows the actual components of the ly @xmath0  absorption line , and panel ( c ) shows the result of the voigt profile fitting procedure .",
    "this complex of nine lines is adequately fitted ( @xmath25 ) with only three velocity components . the derived spectrum is then fitted in the same way used in  3.2 .",
    "the resulting tpcf , figure 3a , is still weaker than that of the civ lines , but clearly detectable .",
    "the assumption that all the velocity dispersion is thermal leads to temperatures in excess of @xmath26k in some cases , and this is inappropriate in most models ( see charlton , 1995 , for a review of the models ) .",
    "we therefore add a second simulation in which the temperature is assumed to be @xmath27k , and any excess doppler parameter is ascribed to turbulence and applied equally to the civ and ly @xmath0  lines . in a few cases the civ doppler parameter is just below the assumed thermal value , and in these cases we simply adopt the @xmath27 thermal width for ly @xmath0 . in this simulations the hi column density is assumed to be @xmath28 that for civ for each component .",
    "the ly @xmath0  lines are now generally narrower than in the first simulation , and so the component structure is more easily detected .",
    "consequently , the ly @xmath0  line tpcf will have larger values at low velocity separations , as can be seen from figure 3 ( b ) .",
    "this should be compared with the observational result that little clustering is found at these redshifts ( e.g. rauch , 1992 ) .",
    "these simulations are indeed too nave , as we are not taking into account the increment in line number density at low column densities",
    ". this increment will produce strong blending effects among low column density lines themselves and also with the higher column density lines .",
    "their combined effect is very difficult to simulate , as it depends very strongly on the higher - order correlation functions of the distribution of the lines . in addition , there are observations that suggest that the amplitude of the clustering is smaller at these low column densities ( hu 1995 ) .",
    "all of these effects could very well erase all the signal in the correlation function for low column density lines , and hence we can not conclude anything on the behavior of these low column density lines other than it is compatible with being clustered but maybe with a smaller clustering amplitude .",
    "the most significant result of the previous sections is that high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers with @xmath1  are strongly clustered in redshift on velocity scales @xmath29 .",
    "while the effect might be due to pairs of clouds with small velocity differences causing the observed tpcf ( miralda - escud 1995 ; rauch 1995 ) , we could be seeing real clustering . with the observed velocity correlation length we can not decide whether the ly @xmath0  absorbers are independent entities , as has generally been assumed so far , or clouds within the halos of galaxies , the possibility we are exploring here .",
    "more detailed questions are even harder to answer , for example the type of galaxies in which the absorbers might reside , whether we are observing multiple clouds within the same galaxies , and the ionization state of carbon in the clouds",
    ". we can only ask if the strength of ly @xmath0  clustering is consistent with expectations of galaxy clustering at these early epochs .    to examine this issue",
    ", we consider a simple model for the evolution of the galaxy tpcf . in a first step ,",
    "we ignore peculiar motions and motions of clouds within galaxies and assume that as a function of velocity and redshift the galaxy tpcf can be described by ( efstathiou 1991 ) @xmath30^{-1.8}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the hubble constant at epoch @xmath32 ( we take @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is the present - day galaxy correlation length .",
    "the evolutionary parameter @xmath35 takes the value @xmath36 for comoving structures , 0 for virialized clusters , and 0.8 for linearly growing perturbations .",
    "recent theoretical studies ( hamilton 1991 ; jain 1995 ) show a steeper dependence on redshift at intermediate stages between the linear and virialized limits .    to avoid the divergence of this function at small values of @xmath37 , we take @xmath38 to be constant below a given velocity difference @xmath39 and equal to @xmath40",
    ". we also convolve it with a gaussian distribution with width @xmath41 to account for random motions . in this way",
    "we get a set of different models defined by three parameters , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath39 , which we allow to vary within the limits : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "predictions of all these models are then compared with the observed tpcf of high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers .",
    "the best fit is achieved for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the 1- , 2- and 3-@xmath41 confidence regions obtained using @xmath39 as an uninteresting parameter are plotted in figure 4 . from this calculation",
    "it is clear that if normal galaxies host the ly @xmath0  absorbers , at an average rate of one per galaxy , their correlation function is evolving rapidly and the combined intragalactic and intergalactic velocity dispersion is @xmath47 .",
    "note that our redshift range is relatively small , @xmath48 , so that we can not separately fit @xmath49 and @xmath35 .",
    "our determination of @xmath35 is therefore anchored by the general galaxy correlation function at the present epoch .",
    "this may be inappropriate in several respects .",
    "we overestimate the correlation function if the host galaxies of the ly @xmath0  clouds are less clustered at the present epoch , for example if they are mostly spiral galaxies , or we underestimate it if there are multiple ly @xmath0  absorbers in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the best we can deduce from our simple analysis is that the observed clustering of high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers is broadly consistent with the expected clustering of galaxies .",
    "we conclude that ( 1 )  high - redshift ly @xmath0  absorbers with @xmath50  are strongly clustered in redshift on velocity scales @xmath51 , ( 2 )  previous measurements of the ly @xmath0  tpcf have underestimated the actual clustering of the absorbers due to unresolved blending of overlapping velocity components , ( 3 )  the present observations may be consistent with the hypothesis that clustering of ly @xmath0  absorption systems persists to lower column densities , being likely that the clustering is smaller at low column densities , and ( 4 )  the observed tpcf is broadly compatible with that expected from galaxies at @xmath52 .",
    "we interpret these results to suggest that many or most ly @xmath0absorbers may arise in galaxies at all epochs , and therefore that the ly @xmath0  forest probes the processes of galaxy formation and evolution for redshifts @xmath3 .",
