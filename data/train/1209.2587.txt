    "a detailed study of the phase transition  containing an incommensurate superstructure followed by a lock - in transition to a commensurate ordering vector  has for example been realised by neutron scattering  @xcite or x - ray diffraction  @xcite .",
    "this transition as well as the cdw state itself were also investigated by angle - resolved photoemission measurements  @xcite , clearly showing the opening of a gap at the fermi level when going to the ordered phase . however , the reasoning that the fermi surface is partially gapped already for temperatures far above the phase transition and the link of this fact to a possible nesting mechanism for the cdw order is supported by reflectivity as well as resistivity measurements  @xcite .",

    "it is reported that the band structure changes extensively upon alkali metal ( na with na / ta@xmath3 and cs with cs / ta varying between 0.3 and  0.6 ) doping in  @xcite and related compounds , such as @xmath4-rb@xmath5tase@xmath6  @xcite and @xmath4-cs@xmath5tase@xmath6 ( up to @xmath7 )  @xcite .",

    "because of the suppression of the cdw , as for example in @xmath1-k@xmath5tas@xmath6  @xcite , the observed super structures can be assumed to result from the intercalated atoms .",
    "structural changes are also discussed in terms of staging effects in the class of silver doped tmdcs in close analogy to intercalated graphite compounds .",
    "the added silver atoms are supposed to slightly disarrange the chalcogenide atoms and with it opening new scattering channels .",

    "appropriate thin films ( thickness of about ) were prepared either by the use of an ultramicrotome or by cleaving with adhesive tape , whereby the crystal was repeatedly cleaved and the glue layer dissolved afterwards .",
    "the films were mounted onto standard electron microscopy grids and transferred to the spectrometer .",
    "as depicted in fig.[fig : superstruct ] , a very good sample quality is achieved , since discrete bragg reflections as well as clear superstructures of the cdw arising at the predicted transition temperature ( ) are visible .",

    "the intercalation levels were achieved by several discrete intercalation steps , of which each took about .",
    "the relation between intercalation time and corresponding increase in potassium content could not be shown to be linear due to several reasons , such as varying getter quality and inhomogeneous saturation of the sample .",
    "furthermore , the saturation potassium content was found to be stable over a time span of several months at room  temperature  and ultra - high vacuum conditions .",

    "fig.[fig : theoretical - results :- a:]c).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to gauge and analyse the experimental results we performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations within the local - density - approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we used the scalar relativistic mode of the full potential local orbital code ( fplo)@xcite in version 9.09 . in order to model the intercalation we used two approaches . in the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) k@xmath11-layers are inserted between adjacent tase@xmath12 layers , where @xmath13 denotes the number of protons and electrons on the vca - pottasium atom , which models the vca equivalent of k@xmath14tase@xmath12 . in this way",
    "the filling effect of the tase bands upon doping can be described . for judging the quality of vca and for incorporating more realistic fermi surface reconstruction effects we constructed several supercells ( sc ) with a corresponding k / ta ratio .",
    "guided by the experimentally observed superstructure patterns we focus on simple supercells with at least a threefold axis .",
    "for @xmath15 we also considered an orthorhombic cell . especially for small concentrations",
    "it is not obvious that pottasium intercalates evenly into all interlayers . to cover such effects two series of supercells were created ,",
    "one with potassium distributed as evenly as possible and one , where only every second interlayer contains the dopant ( for @xmath16 ) .",
    "details about the superstructures are found in the supplementary material .",
    "we did not try to determine the true structural ground state , since this could become rather involved and the purpose of the supercells is merely to supplement and check the vca calculations . for all vca and sc calculations we relaxed all lattice and wyckoff parameters to accomodate breething of the lattice due to k - intercalation .",
    "the @xmath17-integration for the self consistent calculations was performed via the linear tetrahedron method with a @xmath18 mesh for the simple vca k@xmath19ta@xmath12se@xmath20 unit cell . for the supercell",
    "calculations the number of mesh points was adjusted accordingly to obtain an equivalent mesh density .",
    "optical properties were calculated with a @xmath21 mesh within the whole brillouin zone , which was checked for convergence .    for the undoped compound we performed full - relativistic calculations to check the influence of spin orbit coupling on the plasmon frequencies .",
    "it turns out that the spin - orbit - splitting of the bands at the fermi level is quite sizable ( ) but the splittings ( which reduce the @xmath22-dispersion ) occur in such a way that their effects on the @xmath23-plane plasmon energies average out over the brillouin zone .",
    "the resulting changes of in - plane @xmath24 are negligible , while the out - of - plane plasmon energy gets reduced .",
    "we only focus on the in - plane plasmon in this work and hence used scalar relativistic calculations throughout this work .",
    "figure[fig : pot_loss ] ( left panel ) shows loss spectra of @xmath1-k@xmath5tase@xmath6 for increasing potassium content  @xmath10 .",
    "all spectra are normalized in the region around and are furthermore corrected by fitting and subtracting the elastic line , contributing at around zero energy - loss  @xcite . the undoped sample shows a dominating peak at around that , with increasing potassium content , shifts to lower energies .",
    "furthermore , the normalized peak maximum as well as the peak width are reduced .",
    "this spectral feature represents the charge carrier plasmon of the investigated samples , and therefore contains information on the charge carrier density .",
    "the reduction of the plasmon energy is a direct consequence of the charge carrier density variation induced by the potassium doping .",
    "undoped is characterized by half filled conduction bands , and addition of either electrons or holes will lower the plasmon energy as has been discussed previously based on rigid band considerations @xcite . in general ,",
    "the plasmon energy therefore can be also used to analyze the doping level . since the band structure of is rather complex and variations beyond a rigid band approach",
    "can not be excluded , we compared calculated screened plasmon energies ( fig.[fig : theoretical - results :- a : ] , below ) to the measured ones and deduced the @xmath10-axis in the right panel of fig.[fig : pot_loss ] .",
    "we used the thus defined concentrations in the rest of the paper .",
    "note , however , that the calculated and measured screened plasmon energies are remarkably similar , which makes such a gauging procedure feasible ( see also discussion below ) .",
    "it can be concluded that saturation of potassium doping is likely to be reached at about @xmath1-k@xmath8tase@xmath6 .",
    "older reports on intercalation of transition - metal dichalcogenides  were able to find also higher dopant rates up to @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite however , rouxel  @xcite also emphasized that a homogeneous structure in the selenides could only be obtained for rates of @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , the spectral width of charge carrier plasmons in most cases is predominantly determined by damping via interband transitions  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "we attribute the reduction of the plasmon width upon doping mainly to its shift to lower energies , where less interband transitions are available for a damping of the plasmon excitation .",
    "in addition , mid - infrared transitions as observed for undoped are suppressed upon doping  @xcite , which could also reduce the plasmon damping .",

    "additional reflections at one - third and two - third of the [ 100 ] vector are observable in the undoped phase ( topmost left part of fig.[fig : struct_doped_30020 ] ) , which can be assigned to the occurring cdw at temperatures below ( see also fig.[fig : superstruct ] ) .",

    "the most prominent superstructure is a hexagon like ring at around doping ( bottom left part of fig.[fig : struct_doped_30020 ] ) . upon increasing potassium addition , in this state",
    "the sample first shows a mixed superstructure of the cdw spots at one - third and two - third as well as new superstructures occuring at one - half ( for @xmath33 ) and one and three quarter ( for @xmath34 ) , respectively .",
    "however , the latter doping state is no longer showing the original triple cdw superstructure . at the highest possible doping level ( for @xmath29 ) again a ring like structure around the [ 100 ] reflection can be found .",
    "these findings lead to the conclusion that in the cdw is suppressed by k intercalation , as it was also found for the related compound @xmath1-tas@xmath6  @xcite . at the same time new features arise that must be assigned to an increasing potassium filling of the crystal structure . at this point",
    "a comparison between alkali metal intercalated graphite and tmdcs shows striking similarities .",
    "both material classes show a van - der - waals coupled hexagonal layer structure and metallic behavior in their room  temperature  phase  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a transition to a superconducting phase could be induced or supported , respectively , by means of alkali metal doping  @xcite . upon intercalation , most commonly rb or k , graphite is able to form distinct phases , which can be distinguished as stage 1 and 2 ( c@xmath35x and c@xmath36x , respectively , with x being the alkaline metal ) . with increasing content of the dopant it is showing a diversity of superstructures that can be assigned to the intercalant  @xcite .",
    "however , the formation of distinct phases present in intercalated graphite could not be observed in .",
    "in particular the continuous variations in line shape and position of the charge carrier plasmon do not signal the simultaneous presence of two or more phases at any doping level .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of new superstructure peaks at one - half of the basic unit length of would be consistent with the potassium arrangement for a doping rate of @xmath37 as used in our calculations ( see supplementary informations fig.2 left ) .",
    "our theoretically assumed structures ( see supplementary information ) would also be in agreement with these diffraction peaks to persist up to relatively high doping levels . at very high doping the doping induced superstructure would then lead to diffraction peaks at one - third and two - third of the original positions in agreement with fig.[fig : struct_doped_30020 ] ( lower right panel ) .",
    "a quantitative analysis of our diffraction data is not possible because of multiple scattering effects .",
    "since the momentum is transfered within the sample plane  @xcite , it is not possible in the present case to directly access the @xmath0-direction of the crystal . with the possibility to rotate the sample around an axis perpendicular to the beam direction , measurements are possible in a range of with respect to this axis .",
    "figure[fig : polar_angle ] shows elastic scattering measurements ( fully doped sample ) in a plane rotated relative to the sample plane by the denoted angle .",
    "while the left panel shows a clear decrease of the [ 110]-peak intensity ( around ) with increasing angles , the right panel shows rising features at higher momentum transfers , corresponding to reflections with a finite @xmath38 component , such as representing [ 114 ] , [115 ] and [116 ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath38 component of around is in agreement with the value of an earlier x - ray investigation of doped  @xcite , where this value was found for a maximum doping rate of @xmath39 , which is in very good agreement to our stoichiometry analysis ( see below ) .     from the interband contributions ;",
    "b ) the @xmath0-axis lattice parameter ; c ) the plasmon peak position of the calculated loss function , the solid line shows a fit of the supercell frequencies , used for fixing the potassium content of the measured sample ; d ) the bare plasmon frequency .",
    "_ es _ denotes cells with alternatingly empty interlayers . ]    in order to quantitatively determine substantial structural changes , the behavior of the lattice parameters in the lda calculation can be summarized by noting that the planar lattice constant stays rather constant upon doping , while the @xmath0-axis expands with k - intercalation .",
    "figure [ fig : theoretical - results :- a:]b ( black solid symbols ) shows that in the supercell calculations there is a rather sudden widening of the lattice even on small amount of added potasium , due to the rigid ion cores , which need some space and due to the rigidity of the covalently bound tase@xmath12 prisms . for the cells , where only every second interlayer has k the @xmath0-axis is smaller ( light(red ) filled symbols ) , which follows from the same reasoning . with increasing k - content the @xmath0-axis shrinks because of the increasing electrostatic interaction provided by an increasing electron content in the interlayer .",
    "the behavior of vca and sc coincide for larger concentrations .",
    "however , towards smaller @xmath10 the @xmath0 lattice parameter of vca ( open black and light(red ) symbols ) rises above the sc result , which can be understood from the fact that vca contains the k@xmath40-ion cores at a 100@xmath41 filling rate for all concentrations , which keeps the tase@xmath12 layers appart , while for supercells all k - atoms vanish for @xmath42 .",
    "this larger @xmath0-axis spacing however seems to mostly influence the plasma frequency along the @xmath22-direction , which is not considered in this investigation .",
    "however , the @xmath0-axis value of around for @xmath43 and with it the corresponding @xmath38 value ( ) are slightly higher than the ones measured and from the literature  @xcite , respectively .    the planar bare plasmon frequencies of vca and sc calculations fig.[fig : theoretical - results :- a:]d form a consistent trend to lower energy values for increasing potassium content .",
    "we emphasize that for undoped the agreement between our measurements and the calculations is very good .",
    "interestingly , the plasmon frequencies jump , when going from undoped to slightly doped samples , which we attribute to the immediate lattice widening upon small amounts of intercalated potassium .    in order to gain some insight into the screening due to interband transitions and with it the link to the measured plasma frequencies we also calculated the real part of the dielectric function in dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "in general the real part tends to flatten out into a quasi constant ( @xmath44 ) for @xmath45ev .",
    "unfortunately , there are some oscillations for small energies due to a low energy feature in @xmath46 , whose strength is concentration dependent .",
    "this makes a clear extraction of @xmath44 rather approximate .",
    "fig.[fig : theoretical - results :- a:]a shows the trend of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the screening is of the same order as extracted from experiment and also exhibits the sudden jump , upon the doping - onset .",
    "since @xmath44 is not a constant and since the real part has low energy features we used the theoretically calculated loss function to extract a screened plasmon peak position ( fig.[fig : theoretical - results :-",
    "a:]c ) and to estimate the k - content of the samples via the measured plasmons peak position .",
    "the values obtained in this manner are used throughout this contribution .",
    "to summarize , we performed electron energy - loss spectroscopy  as well as lda calculations on the transition - metal dichalcogenide   and thereby investigated the influence of in situ intercalation of potassium into the sample . we demonstrate that our intercalation procedure can be used to achieve rather high doping levels , which allows to study the physical properties of these structures .",
    "furthermore , we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the structure and electronic properties of intercalated compounds . upon doping the charge carrier plasmon continuously",
    "shifts to lower energies , a behavior supported by the theoretical investigations and ruling out a possible formation of doped phases .",
    "the bands at the fermi level , which get filled by potassium doping are of ta@xmath47 character .",
    "their bandwidth @xmath48 is rather small ( below ) , which could hint towards the presence of sizable correlation effects .",
    "however , the wannier functions for these band states as calculated in ref .",
    "are rather extended , which results in a comparatively small value for the hubbard @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we expect a ( possibly much ) larger ratio @xmath50 compared to @xmath51 transistion metal compounds and no pronounced mott - hubbard physics .",
    "structurally , our thin film samples show a transition to a charge - density wave state below in the undoped case and a suppression of the according superstructure upon potassium intercalation . moreover ,",
    "new superstructures with a different periodicity arise that can be assigned to the increasing potassium content in the samples .",
    "the changes in the basic structure with respect to the @xmath0-axis can be consistently found in the electron energy - loss spectroscopy  measurements as well as in the calculations .",
    "the spectral width of the charge carrier plasmon significantly decreases upon potassium addition , i.e. , the plasmon excitation is much less scattered at higher doping levels .",
    "furthermore , as our data indicate the suppression of the charge density wave ground state upon electron doping , it is tempting to speculate about the possibility of an increasing superconducting transition temperature in potassium doped ( in the undoped compound  @xcite ) following the observation that often there is competition between a superconducting and a charge density wave state in transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite .",

    "<S> our observations are consistent with a filling of the conduction band as indicated by a substantial decrease of the plasma frequency in experiment and theory . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , elastic scattering clearly points to a destruction of the cdw upon intercalation as can be seen by a vanishing of the corresponding superstructures . </S>",
    "<S> this is accompanied by a new superstructure , which can be attributed to the intercalated potassium . </S>",
    "<S> based on the behavior of the @xmath0-axis upon intercalation we argue in favor of interlayer - sites for the alkali - metal and that the lattice remains in the @xmath1 modification . </S>"
