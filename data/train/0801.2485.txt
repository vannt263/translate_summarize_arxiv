    "among the chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars of the upper main sequence , the hgmn stars constitute some of the objects most intensively studied with a wide range of optical and ultraviolet spectra ( summarised by @xcite ) .",
    "the reasons for this include that : many of these stars are extremely slow rotators , making details of their line profiles easily studied for isotopic anomalies , for example ; they are not affected by strong magnetic fields , which simplifies theoretical considerations ; and there are many of these stars bright enough to study with the highest spectral resolutions available .",
    "most often these stars have been studied individually , but a few studies have considered single elements among a set of stars to determine the overall behaviour of abundances and isotope distributions as a function of physical variables such as  ( for example , @xcite ) . here , we report an analysis of strong unblended lines of the rare noble gas xenon ( atomic number 54 ; cosmic on the scale where ) with a view to determining its abundance in a sample of hgmn stars .",
    "as will be shown , xe is found in nearly all hgmn stars and exhibits abundance excesses of 3 dex or more .",
    "previous observations of  in the spectra of hgmn stars are scanty , although it was originally reported as a possible identification in 3 cen a by @xcite and a probable identification was reported by @xcite in the he - weak bp star hr6000 which seems to be closely related to the hgmn stars .",
    "more recently ,  was identified in hr 7361 by @xcite ; 46 aql by @xcite ; @xmath1 cnc by @xcite ; 33 gem by @xcite ; 112 her by @xcite .",
    "this sparseness may be attributable to the past tendency to observe these stars mainly in the blue photographic region , where  lines are relatively weak .",
    "for example , @xcite explored cowley s dominion astrophysical observatory 2.4mm@xmath2 spectrograms of several hgmn stars but did not report . in this work , the strong lines of  used were @xmath05292.22 and @xmath04844.33 , supplemented by the weaker @xmath04603.03 visible in most of the programme stars .",
    "the list of stars analysed for this study is from the paper of @xcite who originally listed 26 stars . in table",
    "[ sample ] , two stars are omitted that are not hgmn stars , 36 lyn ( a magnetic ap star ) and hr 6000 , a hot analogue of the hgmn stars .",
    "two other stars were also omitted , @xmath3 phe and @xmath4 cnc , due to absence of good spectra .",
    "this left a sample of 22 hgmn stars .",
    "apart from @xmath5scl , the observations for this study were obtained with the hamilton chelle spectrograph ( he s ; @xcite ) at lick observatory , fed by the 0.6-m coud auxilliary telescope , during four observing runs in 19941997 .",
    "prior to our 1994 observations , improvements were made in the resolution and instrumental profile of the he s by the replacement of some of the optical components , which also made it possible to use the full field of the @xmath6 ccds to maximum advantage . for our observations , both the unthinned phosphor - coated orbit ccd ( dewar 13 ) and , from july 1995 ,",
    "the thinned ford ccd ( dewar 6 ) were used , depending on availability as the latter was shared with the multi - object spectrograph on the 3-m telescope .",
    "the orbit ccd has very few bad pixels or columns .",
    "the ford ccd has several column defects but it has a much higher quantum efficiency in the blue and so we used the ford ccd whenever it was available .",
    "the spectral range for the observations was 38009000  and the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel in the centres of orders ranged from 75 to 250 depending on wavelength . with the slit - settings used , the combination of spectrograph and ccds gave resolutions @xmath7 .",
    "we used the polar axis quartz lamp for flat fields and a th  ar comparison for wavelength calibration .",
    "the observations of @xmath5scl are from the uves paranal observatory project ( eso ddt program i d 266.d-5655 ) which is an on - going program to observe , reduce and provide a public library of good quality spectra of bright southern stars obtained with the ultraviolet and visual chelle spectrograph ( uves ) mounted on the very large telescope ( vlt ) unit keuyen ( vlt ut2 ) .",
    "the uves paranal observatory project is described by @xcite .",
    "the project provides almost complete wavelength coverage from 300010000  for all stars observed .",
    "the spectral resolution is about 80000 and the",
    "typical s / n is 300500 in the .",
    "the lick observatory chelle spectra were extracted and calibrated using standard iraf extraction packages @xcite , running on the starlink node of university college london ( ucl ) .",
    "previous measurements @xcite showed that there were no measurable effects of parasitic light ( residual scattered light ) in the line profiles provided that general scattered light in the adjacent interorder spaces was taken as the subtracted background . in practice ,",
    "the residual scattered light was less than approximately 1 per cent and so we have made no corrections for it ( see @xcite for further details ) .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for hr7143 ( @xmath8 k ) , we adopted the estimate @xmath9 m ; for hr7361 ( @xmath10 k ) , .",
    "xenon ( ) is yet another of the spectra originally omitted from the revised multiplet tables by @xcite as ` not of astrophysical interest ' yet subsequently found in the hgmn stars and other cp types ( e.g. , ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  and  have also been identified in stars ) .    the xenon enhancement in hgmn stars rivals that of other rare elements such as hg @xcite with many of the stars having xe enhancement factors of .",
    "such a large enhancement of abundance implies a strong upwards radiative acceleration on xe over a wide range of  and ,  and it will be interesting to see if this prediction is confirmed by future calculations , and to see whether xe is expected to be stratified in a thin layer .",
    "radiative diffusion processes must be dredging up xenon from deep inside the stellar envelope to get an enhancement of this size . as can be seen in figure  [ fig - abunds ] , the enhancements found in the cooler hgmn stars clustered around are all very similar at about 3.9 dex . at higher ,",
    "the enhancements show much more scatter , which is not an artifact of the measurement uncertainties but must be a real effect .",
    "the one star with an upper limit only , @xmath11her , could itself have a considerable enhancement of xe but yet be below the limit of detectability in the present work .",
    "we looked at what we feel are the 10 best - observed stars in table  [ abunds ] to see if there were any systematic differences in results from the lines used .",
    "the mean difference between derived from @xmath04844 and @xmath05292 is , so these two lines give results that agree very well .",
    "the mean difference between abundances from @xmath04603 and the average of the other two lines is , which seems obviously significant .",
    "the most likely explanation is an error in one or more of the adopted oscillator strengths .",
    "however , this does not affect any of the essential conclusions in this work .",
    "the rarity of  identifications in previous work is explicable by the relative weakness of its lines in the photographic blue region , where many observations were done only below 4600 .",
    "it is easy to understand why the lines might be overlooked in some earlier work of this sort  and in at least one case , a strong line of another element masks the presence of a  line , as discussed below .      in the course of an investigation of strontium abundances in hgmn stars @xcite it was noticed that  @xmath04215.519 apparently persisted even when  @xmath04077.714 was completely undetectable .",
    "an example of this is seen in the  results of @xcite , where @xmath04215.519 has a measured equivalent width of 6.5m  in 112her .",
    "we also found a similar strength for this line , but a wavelength slightly shifted .",
    "we were unable to detect  @xmath04077.714 at all ( @xmath120.6m ) , nor did @xcite report seeing this line .",
    "the solution to this anomaly is our identification of a blend of  with  @xmath04215.60 @xcite , which has an estimated strength of 4m  in 112her from the abundance in table  [ abunds ] and an astrophysical  of @xmath13 , based on the lick observations of the ultra - sharp - lined , sr - deficient , `` mild '' hgmn star 46aql @xcite .",
    "the remaining strength of this feature in 112her is probably due to weak lines of and .",
    "strontium is at least 1.0 dex below solar abundance in both 46aql and 112her .",
