    "all possible responses of the medium can be formally represented as the functions @xmath14 , where the index @xmath15 labels a type of the medium s response ( such as absorption , spontaneous emission , output intensity and phase , polarization , refraction index and so on ) . in these terms , the conventional spectroscopy studies the frequency dependencies @xmath14 at a set of constant input parameters @xmath16 .    in contrast , we propose another scenario , when at least one of medium s responses @xmath17 is fixed at a constant level ( during frequency scanning ) by applying feedback to the manipulated input parameters @xmath13 : @xmath18 in this case the eq .",

    "an approach similar to ours had been used only once before . in a saturation interference experiment @xcite the light s",
    "frequency and phase had been controlled simultaneously . as a result , the spectral resolution had been improved by a factor of 1.5 compared to the traditional saturation spectroscopy .",
    "let us apply our method to the dark resonance , which is formed by the bichromatic traveling wave with close frequencies @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the amplitude of the @xmath25-th frequency component ( @xmath25=1,2 ) , @xmath26 is the wave number , and the function @xmath27 describes the transverse field distribution in the light beam ( step - like , gaussian , and so on ) .",
    "we consider the standard three - level @xmath28 scheme ( see .",
    "[ lambda]a ) with two optical transitions @xmath29 , @xmath30 , which are resonant to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the rabi frequencies are defined as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the matrix elements of the dipole moment operator @xmath37 .    as is well known , in such a @xmath28 system near the energy splitting @xmath38 a narrow two - photon dark resonance is observed . if the equality is exact , ( @xmath4)=@xmath5 , a dark state exists : @xmath39 equals zero .",
    "we use the standard formalism of a wigner density matrix @xmath40(@xmath41 ) , which satisfies the equation : @xmath42,\\quad \\text{tr}\\{\\hat{\\rho}\\}=1,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the atom velocity , @xmath44 is the gradient operator .",
    "the functional operator @xmath45 describes the relaxation processes due to the spontaneous emission and the collisions ( velocity changes , collisional broadening , spin - exchange ) in a buffer gas or in a cell with an anti - relaxation coating .",
    "consider the scenario , when the spontaneous fluorescence intensity is fixed , i.e. the total population of atoms in the upper state @xmath46 stays unchanged . in this case , the condition ( [ condition ] ) can be rewritten as an integral over the spatial and velocity variables : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is a function of the maxwell velocity distribution at temperature @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the spatial density of the atoms .    for simplicity , we study an optically thin medium with longitudinal size @xmath52 , and neglect the doppler effect .",
    "this corresponds to the case when the buffer gas collision broadening of the optical transitions @xmath29 and @xmath30 exceeds the doppler broadening . also , we consider a step - like cylindrical transverse field distribution : @xmath27=1 for @xmath53 and @xmath27=0 for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the radius of the light beam . under these assumptions",
    "the integral condition ( [ spont ] ) can be reformulated for the single - atom population at the upper level : @xmath56 it is obviously that here we take into account the atoms , which are inside of the light beam .",
    "the typical conditions for the two - photon spectroscopy of alkali atoms in the buffer gas are @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the broadening of the optical transition , @xmath59 is the rate of spontaneous relaxation of the upper level @xmath60 ( see . fig .",
    "[ lambda]a ) , and @xmath61 is a rate of relaxation to the unperturbed equal distribution of populations at the ground states @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( including the decay of the coherence @xmath64=@xmath65 between states @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) . for the optical resonance condition ( @xmath66 , see fig .",

    "can be considered as an equation with respect to @xmath72 , where the positive real root describes the frequency dependence of the squared rabi frequency @xmath73 on the two - photon detuning @xmath74 for a given @xmath75 .",
    "since the value @xmath72 is proportional to the field intensity @xmath76 , we automatically obtain the frequency dependence of the input intensity @xmath77 for a fixed number of excited atoms @xmath78 in the light beam .",
    "the calculated dependencies @xmath79 for several values of the @xmath75 parameter are presented in fig.[curves ] . as follows from the plots , the resonance amplitude significantly increases for large @xmath80 parameters . at the same time , far off the resonance the dependencies remain practically unchanged .",
    "the width of the resonance is less than @xmath81 and is too remains almost unaltered .",
    "it can be shown that the resonance amplitude goes asymptotically to infinity .",
    "this extreme case takes place at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the limit of @xmath84 at @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , from ( [ sp_alpha ] ) we find @xmath87 .",
    "in general , @xmath83 depends on the ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 , i.e. on the decay rates of the different channels ( see fig .  [",
    "lambda]a ) .",
    "if @xmath90 there is an interval of @xmath6 ( centered at @xmath6=0 ) , where the positive real root @xmath79 of equation ( [ sp_alpha ] ) does not exist , i.e. the @xmath77 has no physical meaning in this frequency interval .",
    "the results , described above , could be explained in the following way .",
    "when @xmath91 the input laser intensity is regulated by the feedback in a range between @xmath92 at the exact two - photon resonance ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath93 , when the frequency is far off the resonance ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this explains the significant increase of the resonance amplitude and contrast for @xmath95 .",
    "the width of the resonance remains small in our method .",
    "indeed , let us consider the variation of the two - photon detuning from the tail to the center of the resonance .",
    "obviously , under the week field conditions @xmath96 and at @xmath97 the population of the exited state @xmath98 and the intensity @xmath99 weakly depend on the frequency detuning .",
    "therefore , noticeable changes of the intensity @xmath77 caused by detuning can be detected only at @xmath100 near @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , the top of the resonance is formed at high light intensity and the bottom part at low .",
    "thus , the quality of the resonance ( the ratio of the amplitude and the width ) also increases significantly .",
    "additionally we note that the shape of the cpt resonance at @xmath82 is far from a lorentzian .",
    "it should be pointed out that the behavior of the resonance width as a function of laser intensity is abnormal . in case of equal intensities of the bichromatic field components",
    "@xmath101 the resonance width _",
    "narrows _ in some range of the increasing intensity ( see fig.[broadening1 ] ) .",
    "such dependence is in contrast to the conventional spectroscopy , where the power broadening is regularly observed .",
    "thus , the feedback spectroscopy allows , in principle , to overcome some fundamental limitations of the traditional spectroscopy ( 2@xmath102 minimal width of the cpt resonances in our case ) . however , this `` extravagant '' result is not universal and corresponds to the particular case of equal rabi frequencies @xmath101 . for the case",
    "when @xmath103 the calculations show some power broadening ( see fig.[curves2 ] ) . but",
    "this broadening also has an abnormality - saturation at large intensities ( see fig.[broadening2 ] ) .",
    "in general , the analysis made above for feedback spectroscopy of the cpt resonance clearly shows a radical increase of the contrast and quality , which is not related to the optical density of the medium .",
    "indeed , the frequency dependence of the input laser intensity @xmath77 is independent of the number of atoms and can be extracted from the expression for the one - atom density matrix ( see eq .  ( [ sp_alpha ] ) ) . on the other hand , in conventional spectroscopy",
    "the absorption is proportional to the number of atoms .",
    "thus , the feedback - spectroscopy method is more effective ( with respect to the conventional spectroscopy ) for small atomic density .",
    "we believe that the number of atoms mostly influences on the noise properties of the feedback spectroscopy , but it requires a special theoretical and experimental study .",
    "this new spectroscopy method could be implemented in the following two ways : a ) the transmission spectrum for the optically thin medium ( see ( fig.@xmath104a ) is described as @xmath105@xmath106@xmath107 $ ] , where the constant @xmath108 corresponds to the constant level of the spontaneously scattered light ( for given experimental conditions ) ; and b ) the input laser intensity @xmath109@xmath106@xmath77 is detected directly before the cell ( see fig .",

    "the experiment is carried out with a pyrex cell ( 25  mm long and 25  mm in diameter ) containing isotopically enriched @xmath111rb and a @xmath112 torr neon buffer gas .",
    "the cell is placed inside a magnetic shield . for the results reported here the cell temperature was in the range of 1641  @xmath113c .",

    "the ground state relaxation rate @xmath102 is inversely proportional to the transit time of atoms crossing the laser beam , enhanced by the multiple collisions with buffer gas molecules .",
    "experimentally it has been found that this value is approximately @xmath118(0.51 )  khz .",
    "the broadening of the optical transition by the buffer gas is estimated as @xmath1194050  mhz @xcite .",
    "the detector pd2 is an array of 10 photodiodes connected in parallel and equally spaced along the circumference of the the cell body .",
    "pd2 detects 15@xmath0 of the fluorescence generated by the rubidium vapor .",
    "the pid amplifier sends the signal to the acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) to lock the fluorescence intensity at the level of the @xmath120=0 .",

    "the detected eit resonances are shown in fig.@xmath122 , the curves correspond to the @xmath111rb transmission spectra for the two cases of `` a '' open and `` b '' closed fluorescence feedback loop with lock point at the maximum of the cpt transmittance . if the feedback loop is closed at frequencies different than @xmath123 the amplitude of the cpt resonance and the overall level of doppler absorption increase ( to be precise , to the level of non - resonant scattered light in the fluorescence signal ) .",

    "the beam sizes for this case are 6  mw and 5@xmath1273  mm@xmath128 .",
    "the scattered light from the window and the wall of the cell cause an additive shift of the fluorescence level . to avoid this distortion , the cell s surface are carefully cleaned .",

    "the fitting lines in the right panel have the weak nonlinearity probably due to the transversal gaussian intensity distribution in accordance with the results of @xcite .",

    "the saturation doppler - free spectroscopy @xcite also has been tested .",
    "all of listed schemes show the same advantages of our method .",
    "in general , the performed experiments confirm the main results of our theoretical analysis .",

    "also the following fundamental issue has caught our attention - can the electronic feedback alters the physical properties of the atomic medium in our method ?",
    "for example , in the 1980s it was found that the application of electronic feedback can change the essential physical property of a laser diode - its coherence @xcite .",
    "if the feedback bandwidth is greater than the frequency spectrum of the dominate spontaneous noise , the linewidth of the diode laser is narrowed .",
    "similarly , we could expect to have an influence of the electronic feedback on the physical properties of the medium due to the coupling between the spontaneous radiation and the laser light . in our case",
    "this coupling occurs because the fluctuations of the spontaneous emission ( from all atoms ) due to feedback are transferred into the laser light fluctuations and vice versa .",
    "thus , from general viewpoint the spontaneous emission from the medium can not be considered as a simple sum from independent atoms . consequently , under sufficiently wide - band feedback the fluctuation properties of the laser and spontaneous fields are correlated and should be considered matched . therefore , the suggested method needs further theoretical and experimental studies along these lines .",
    "note , the theoretical treatment in the present paper did not account this correlation , which may be , in principle , an additional cause of disagreements between the experiment and the theory .",
    "finally , we have formulated the basic principles of the feedback spectroscopy .",

    "the feedback spectroscopy might give great advantages .",
