    "a given metrized graph can be modelled by a family of weighted combinatorial graphs by marking a finite number of points on the metrized graph and declaring them to be vertices .",
    "on each of these models we have a laplacian matrix , which acts on functions defined on the vertices of the model . on the metrized graph",
    "there is a measure - valued laplacian operator .",
    "the goal of this paper is to prove that the spectra of these two operators are intimately related .",
    "indeed , we will show that if we pick a sequence of models for @xmath2 whose vertices become equidistributed , then the eigenvalues of the discrete laplacians on the models converge to the eigenvalues of the laplacian operator on @xmath2 provided we scale them correctly .",
    "moreover , we can show that in a precise sense the eigenvectors of the discrete laplacian converge uniformly to eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator on the metrized graph .",
    "this type of approximation result for laplacian eigenvalues dates back at least to the papers of fukaya ( @xcite ) and fujiwara ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the measured hausdorff topology is defined on closed riemannian manifolds of a fixed dimension subject to certain curvature hypotheses , and it is shown that convergence of manifolds in this topology implies convergence of eigenvalues for the associated laplace - beltrami operators .",
    "an analogue of the measured hausdorff topology for the class of finite weighted graphs is defined in @xcite ; a similar convergence result for eigenvalues of the discrete laplacian operator is obtained . in @xcite ,",
    "fujiwara approximates a closed riemannian manifold by embedded finite graphs and proves that the eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator can be bounded in terms of the eigenvalues of the associated graph laplacians . in the present paper",
    "we use an approach remarkably similar to the one in @xcite ; this is purely a coincidence as the author was unaware of fujiwara s work until after giving a proof of the main theorem",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the methods employed here can improve upon @xcite when applied to the approximation of riemannian manifolds by graphs .    without giving too many of the details ,",

    "the values of @xmath12 in the above table could reasonably be converging to @xmath26 .",

    "the fact that the dimensions of the eigenspaces for @xmath11 and @xmath26 agree is no coincidence , and a precise statement of this phenomenon constitutes part ( b ) of theorem  [ main theorem ] .",

    "the laplacian operator can be defined on a much larger class of continuous functions than @xmath70 , and the eigenfunctions of @xmath20 in general need not lie in the zhang space .",
