    "since a nucleon is not a point object , but has structure , it must undergo changes when placed inside a nucleus . among other properties , the meson - nucleon coupling constants may change . if this happens , it should affect the nn force .",
    "these effects have to be small .",
    "otherwise , traditional nuclear physics , where one uses free - space two - body force would have failed badly .",
    "but even small changes in the nn force may have noticeable effect on the properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate possible changes of meson nucleon coupling constants due to the quark structure of the nucleon and their ultimate effects on the saturation properties , such as the density @xmath6 and the binding energy @xmath7 of nuclear matter .",
    "the nn force in nuclear matter may become density dependent due to a wide variety of reasons .",
    "any time one eliminates some degrees of freedom the resulting effective interaction becomes density dependent , the brueckner @xmath8-matrix being the most widely known example .",
    "another recent example is the work of li  @xcite on the effective interaction to be used in a mean field calculation which reproduces the results of a brueckner - hartree - fock calculation .",
    "the density dependence studied here involves excitations of n@xmath9 ( @xmath10 resonances ) degrees of freedom .",
    "ultimately we are interested in the change of the nn force in the medium .",
    "in relativistic nuclear physics the most important forces are mediated by a scalar - isoscalar field with @xmath11 mev and a vector - isoscalar field with @xmath12 mev .",
    "thus the force range is short and the neighboring nucleons which can alter the internal structure of the interacting nucleons must also be close . due to the exclusion principle and short - range correlations , the effective density of the polarizing nucleons , denoted as @xmath13 ,",
    "is less than half the normal nuclear density .",
    "it is quite possible that the @xmath14 excitations produced by the neighboring nucleons may be treated perturbatively .",
    "however , an earlier study of this problem  @xcite established that a fairly large number of resonances contribute . the mean field approach , which generates the eigen - combination of n and @xmath14s as the lowest state in the field due to the neighboring nucleons is a more expeditious way of calculating the effect .",
    "our quantitative studies are based on the following strategy .",
    "we describe the structure of the nucleon with a model called the chiral confining model ( ccm )  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use the toy  @xcite version of this model .",
    "the role of nuclear matter is simulated with baths of external and fields , the vacuum values being @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the nucleon structure problem is solved in the presence of these bath fields .",
    "then various properties of the nucleon , including meson nucleon coupling constants , are calculated for ranges of values of the two bath fields .",
    "the fact that the and the fields are , in turn , produced by the nucleons through field - dependent coupling constants allows us to obtain density dependences of the and the fields by solving appropriate nonlinear self - consistency equations .",
    "once this has been done , we can use the known field dependences of various properties of the nucleon to obtain their density dependences .",
    "we indicate the density - dependent values of various properties of the nucleon with a star .",
    "thus @xmath17 denotes the free space nn coupling constant and @xmath18 the same quantity in nuclear matter .",
    "the latter is always dependent on @xmath19 , the nuclear density .",
    "we may note that the properties of nuclear matter depend principally on @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the last is the @xmath25 pauli coupling coefficient .",
    "a necessary input is the field - dependence of the exchanged meson masses .",
    "we use the simple model that the meson masses are linearly dependent on the field , keeping the pion mass fixed .",
    "the coefficient of linear dependence of and masses on the field is chosen to give @xmath26 at normal nuclear density .",
    "the changes , as found in the ccm , clearly will have effect on the properties of nuclear matter . to study this",
    "we adopt the relativistic many - body approach  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we carry out a relativistic dirac - brueckner calculation of the properties of nuclear matter using the one - boson - exchange model of ref .  @xcite . for the quasi - potential version of this model",
    "the full dirac structure of the nn amplitude in free space has been constructed  @xcite .",
    "the resulting so - called ia2 representation can be used to determine the saturation properties of nuclear matter  @xcite . modifying the free space t - matrix to also include pauli - blocking and introducing our density - dependent meson - nucleon coupling constants , self - consistent relativistic dirac - brueckner calculations were performed in the manner of ref .",
    "@xcite for a range of @xmath13 the effective density of the polarizing nucleons .",
    "our main results are that    i [ ] ( i ) the effects of the density - dependent meson nucleon coupling constants , arising out of the quark structure of the nucleons , on the saturation density and @xmath7 at saturation are small but not negligible , i [ ] ( ii ) and they do tend to improve the results .    the next section contain brief introduction to the chiral confining model ( ccm ) and its toy version .",
    "section 3 describes the calculation of nucleon properties as functions of bath @xmath27 and @xmath28 fields .",
    "these results are used in the next section to extract density dependences of nucleon properties .",
    "section 5 describes the relativistic treatment of nuclear matter using the dirac - brueckner approach .",
    "the last section presents the main results , discussions of these results and concluding remarks .",
    "an early attempt at extracting density dependence of nucleon properties using ccm is described in ref .",
    "the present paper contains two significant improvements - inclusions of the instanton induced interaction and the pion cloud contributions to @xmath0 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 coupling constants .",
    "the ccm has been described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief review .",
    "the ccm is based on the notion of color dielectric function as introduced by nielsen and ptkos  @xcite . by considering the average of all possible link operators , starting from @xmath31 and ending on @xmath32 with the paths completely contained in a four - dimensional hypercube of side @xmath33",
    ", they introduced a color singlet , lorentz scalar quantity @xmath34 and a color octet , lorentz vector , coarse grained gluon field @xmath35 : k(x)&=&_0tr , + b_=12_a _ a b^a_&=&_0i . upon integrating out the qcd gluon fields in favor of these new collective variables",
    "one obtains the nielsen - ptkos lagrangian in the form of a derivative expansion : _",
    "np=(x)[ik(x)12-k(x)m_q - gb/(x)](x ) -g^a_g^a+  .",
    "npl1 the gauge field is @xmath36 and not @xmath35 .",
    "the coarse grained field tensor is g^a_=_- _",
    "npl2 from the gluonic term one identifies @xmath37 as the color dielectric function . conjectured that k_vac=0 .",
    "kvac1 this conjecture , crucial for our model , has been justified from the lattice gauge point of view by lee  @xcite .",
    "a quark has ever - present interaction with the quark condensate of the vacuum .",
    "if @xmath38 , the interaction will appear to be infinitely strong compared to quark kinetic energy and a quark can not exist in that region .",
    "it can only reside in the region where @xmath39 .",
    "a color singlet quark system can polarize the vacuum and change the value of @xmath40 away from zero , thus dynamically generating the _ bag _ where the quarks can stay .",
    "the nielsen - ptkos lagrangian recognizes the existence of gluon condensate through the vanishing of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the quark condensate is not manifest . without it",
    "one can not develop an effective lagrangian which contains the physics of the interaction of a quark with the quark condensate .",
    "we deal with this problem by conjecturing that one can integrate out the coarse grained gluon fields in favor of meson fields as new collective variables  @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to introduce , following nielsen and ptkos  @xcite , a new color singlet , lorentz scalar field , @xmath42 , proportional to @xmath40 by the equation k(x)=(x ) .",
    "chi being related to @xmath40 , a purely gluonic object , the @xmath42 field is a member of the glueball family .",
    "hence , it is a chiral singlet , a fact evident from the first term of the nielsen - ptkos lagrangian given by eq .",
    "( [ npl1 ] ) .",
    "large @xmath43 analysis shows that it is a hybrid field  @xcite . the result ( [ kvac1 ] ) imposes the requirement that _ vac=0 .",
    "chivac    retaining minimum powers of fields and their derivatives the basic lagrangian of the ccm has the form : _",
    "ccm&=&k(x)(x)[i12-m_q](x ) + & + & ( x)(x ) + & + & l_meson + 12 _ ^- u ( ) . lccm the quantities @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the quark - meson coupling constants .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is the current quark mass .",
    "its value is set at @xmath48 mev .",
    "it contributes @xmath49 mev to the @xmath50n sigma term  @xcite . because of its negligible role in the present work we",
    "will neither refer to this term nor count it as a parameter in our subsequent discussions .",
    "however , it is included in the actual numerical work .",
    "we use the chiral invariant lagrangian of lee and nieh  @xcite for @xmath51 .",
    "the lagrangian ensures that @xmath52 and that the mesons have their respective physical masses when calculated at the classical ( or tree ) level .",
    "the fields @xmath50 and @xmath27 form a @xmath53 representation of @xmath54 , while the fields @xmath55 form @xmath56 and @xmath57 representations .    to complete the definition of @xmath58",
    "one must specify the @xmath42 potential .",
    "since nothing substantial is known about it , we try two simple forms : & & u()=12 m_^2 , + quartic : & & u()=12 m_^2(1-/_0)^2 .",
    "uchi the quartic potential has two minima , the one at @xmath59 describes the vacuum while the other at @xmath60 is an ` excited ' state , which for simplicity we keep degenerate with the vacuum .",
    "the value of @xmath61 , the location of the second minimum is set at @xmath62 mev .",
    "the hybrid mass , @xmath63 is set at @xmath64 mev . as we will discuss later , the results of the calculations depend largely on one particular combination of these parameters and rather weakly on individual ones .    any mean field calculation containing isovector fields",
    "requires using states which do not have good isospin symmetry . to accomplish this we use hedgehog spinors and fields , introduced first for @xmath50 and @xmath27 fields by chodos and thorn  @xcite and extended to vector meson fields by broniowski  @xcite .",
    "we closely follow the mean field analysis of ren  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the appearence of @xmath40 in the denominator of the quark - meson interaction term is not _",
    "ad hoc_. it is obtained by matching the @xmath40 dependence of the four - quark interactions which arise on the one hand from @xmath65 by integrating out the @xmath66 fields and on the other hand from @xmath58 by integrating out the meson fields  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the factor @xmath40 with @xmath67 changes the field canonically conjugate to @xmath68 from the usual @xmath69 to @xmath70 . as a result",
    "the quark term in all noether s currents carries the factor @xmath40 .",
    "the transformation @xmath71 makes the pair @xmath68 and @xmath69 canonical and removes the factor @xmath40 from all noether s currents .",
    "two changes occur in @xmath58 .",
    "the free quark term no longer has the factor @xmath40 , while the quark meson interaction acquires the factor @xmath72 in place of @xmath40 in the denominator .",
    "mean field treatment of @xmath58 with a variety of reasonable sets of parameters reveals  @xcite that even where the quark density is large the meson fields differ only slightly from their respective vacuum values .",
    "this suggests strongly that we introduce a simplified version of ccm .",
    "the simplified version , which we call the toy model , consists of fixing all meson fields at their vacuum values : _",
    "vac =- f _ , + v_vac=_vac = v_vac = _1_vac=0 , leaving only the quark fields and the @xmath42 field as dynamical variables .",
    "the toy model lagrangian , in terms of the canonical quark field , is given below .",
    "_ toy=(x)[i12-m_q- ] ( x)+12 _ ^- u ( ) .",
    "ltoy not counting @xmath47 , the toy model has only two parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath63 in the pure mass version and one additional parameter , @xmath61 , in the quartic version .",
    "formation of the bag is even more transparent in the toy model as the constituent quark mass term , @xmath74 , becomes infinite when @xmath75 .",
    "the unusual form of the quark - meson interaction with the factor of @xmath76 in the denominator is of some importance in the present investigation . in its absence",
    "a constant external field will merely shift the energy of the quark without exciting it to higher states .",
    "thus the nucleon will not be polarized .",
    "a constant field will excite the quark .",
    "orthonormality of different eigenstates of the dirac hamiltonian ensures that @xmath77 , but not the vanishing of @xmath78 .",
    "the latter gives the effect of a constant external field .",
    "the presence of the factor @xmath79 enables a constant external field to excite the quark and enhances the ability of a constant external field to do the same .    because of its importance it is necessary to provide some evidence for the presence of @xmath79 in the denominator of the quark - meson interaction term .",
    "fortunately , there is a verifiable consequence of this feature .",
    "gauge invariance ensures that there is no such modification of the photon - quark interaction .",
    "thus contrary to the conjectures of universal coupling  @xcite or current - field identity  @xcite the isovector couplings of the photon and the @xmath25 meson differ by this @xmath80 factor . because of this difference , ccm predicts that the @xmath25-nucleon pauli coupling constant , @xmath30 should differ from the isovector anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath81 .",
    "the predicted  @xcite value is @xmath82 , instead of @xmath83 predicted by the two conjectures .",
    "based on dispersion theoretic analysis of @xmath84 scattering data hhler and pietarinen  @xcite had estimated the ratio to be @xmath85 .",
    "our value is within the possible uncertainties of this result  @xcite .",
    "meson couple to the quark in different manner .",
    "brown and rho had exploited this feature to explain the value of @xmath86 . dialing the chiral angle they fitted the value @xmath87 .",
    "our result is approximately independent of parameters because of the scaling property mentioned later . ]",
    "the role of the pion field on baryon properties is never negligible . in the toy model",
    "one takes account of it perturbatively  @xcite wherever appropriate . in the context of the present study such corrections are important in the calculations of the coupling constants of mesons of even @xmath8-parity , @xmath17 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the toy model with perturbative pionic correction gives poor results for the masses of @xmath90 and @xmath91 and for the nucleon charge radii  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that there is approximate , but very good scaling behavior in the toy model .",
    "if one chooses the parameters to get the nucleon mass right the values of most other quantities are nearly fixed .",
    "thus the bad results for mass and size can not be improved simultaneously by varying parameters .",
    "one needs a new interaction which is short - ranged and more attractive between singlet - singlet quark pairs than between triplet - triplet pairs .",
    "the magnetic one - gluon exchange interaction  @xcite fits the requirement exactly .",
    "however , the physics of exchange of a color octet tower of gluons is already incorporated in meson exchanges .",
    "we can not include it again .",
    "we solve the problem by including the instantanton induced t hooft interaction  @xcite .",
    "in the two flavor case of @xmath92 and @xmath93 quarks , the t hooft interaction generates interactions between quark pairs in flavor antisymmetric state only and the interaction is attractive and zero - ranged .",
    "so it fits our requirement without duplicating any mechanism already included .",
    "using shuryak s",

    "assuming that all meson masses and all coupling constants , except @xmath18 are independent of @xmath148 , the density dependence of @xmath2 can be modelled in the following manner : @xmath149 ,   \\label{app1}\\ ] ] where , for convenience , we have introduced the quantity @xmath150    the first two terms describe the density dependence of @xmath2 near the saturation point when none of the coupling constants and meson masses is density dependent .",
    "the quantity @xmath151 is the nuclear incompressibility and @xmath152 is the minimum value of @xmath2 in this situation .",
    "the last term contains the effect of the density dependence of @xmath18 , calculated perturbatively , using , in addition , the fact that @xmath153 _ i.e. , _ the average squared relative momentum of two fermi sea nucleons is much smaller than the square of the meson mass .",
    "an inspection of the two graph in the left column of fig .",
    "[ coupling ] shows that the quadratic form : @xmath154 can describe these graphs quite well .",
    "the ratio @xmath155 peaks at @xmath156 and the peak value is @xmath157 .",
    "the values of the various parameters used in the illustration are @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "we consider four sets of @xmath161 and @xmath162 , namely , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .",
    "the first two describe the ratios @xmath165 for the quartic and the puremass cases , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ coupling ] .",
    "the last two are used to illustrate the origin of looping .",
    "it is convenient to recast eq .",
    "( [ app1 ] ) into the form : @xmath166/k_0=(y-1)^2-   y\\frac{3\\rho_0}{4k_0}\\frac{\\gs(0)^2 } { m_\\sigma^2 } \\left[(g_{\\sigma nn}(\\rho)/g_{\\sigma nn}(0))^2 - 1\\right ] .",
    "\\label{ebya}\\ ] ] because of the presence of the third term in eq .",
    "( [ app1 ] ) the saturation density will change . for a given value of @xmath141",
    "this can be readily determined by minimizing the expression for @xmath2 with respect to @xmath167 .",
    "the resulting plots of the change in the binding energy at the new saturation density vs. @xmath168 are shown in fig .",
    "[ loop ] for the four sets of where @xmath141 has been varied in the region @xmath169    starting from zero density , as @xmath170 increases with @xmath171 the quantity @xmath2 becomes more negative .",
    "the saturation properties reflect this through a combination of increasing saturation density , @xmath25 , and decreasing @xmath2",
    ". eventually , decrease of @xmath170 beyond its peak with increasing @xmath171 and the effect of incompressibilty take over and the saturation density stops increasing . if this occurs in the range @xmath172 , we see looping . if the peak of @xmath173 occurs at a higher density , _",
    "i.e. , _ for a higher @xmath161 , the saturation density keeps on increasing and we see no looping for @xmath174 . in the present example",
    "the critical value of @xmath161 for @xmath175 appears to be slightly higher than 0.7 .",
    "thus the occurence of a peak of @xmath173 at not too high a value of the effective density is needed for looping to occur for @xmath176 .",
    "the value of @xmath161 is lower for the quartic case than for the puremass case .",
    "this explains why the loop turns for the former case at a density lower than that for the latter .      due to the internal structure of the nucleon",
    ", we should , in general , expect that the effective meson nucleon parameters may change in nuclear medium . using a chiral confining model",
    "we have studied the density dependent changes of the meson - nucleon coupling parameters .",
    "we have also used a simple ansatz for the density dependence of and masses . using the framework of a dirac - brueckner analysis we have found that their effect on the saturation properties of nuclear matter can be significant . due to the density dependence of the @xmath18 as predicted by the chiral confining model we have found , in particular , a looping behaviour in the nuclear matter binding energy at saturation density .",
    "the looping has essentially also been verified in a simple model , where it is mainly caused by the presence of a peak in the density dependence of the medium modified @xmath1 coupling constant at a low density .",
    "we should stress that the effect of the density dependence of the other quantities are not negligible .",
    "however , a qualitative understanding of the looping effect can be obtained by paying attention to the density dependence of @xmath0 alone .",
    "it appears that the density dependence of the coupling constants and the meson masses produce effects which are small but interesting . in particular the small effect tends to improve the results for nuclear matter . from the present study",
    "we see that the relationship between binding energy and saturation density may not be as universal as found in nonrelativistic studies and that more model dependence is exhibited once medium modifications of the basic nuclear interactions are considered .",
    "we hope that these preliminary results will encourage more detailed investigation of this particular variety of density dependence of the nn interaction .",
