    "carbon nanotubes have attracted an enormous amount of attention and generated an immense level of theoretical and experimental activity . it has been rightly pointed out that single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcn ) represent ideal one - dimensional systems and one may expect to observe here exotic phenomena characteristic for strong correlations in one dimension .",
    "most of the attention has been concentrated on a possibility of tomonaga - luttinger liquid .",
    "though such liquid is certainly a very interesting object , it is just one of many wonders strong correlations can produce .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the physics of an armchair swcn at half filling .",
    "the features which dominate this physics are the unscreened coulomb interaction and umklapp processes .",
    "the importance of the unscreened coulomb interaction for nanotubes away from half filling was already noticed in the previous studies @xcite,@xcite . at half filling",
    "some additional factors come into play .",
    "it was realized in @xcite that the long - range coulomb interaction makes the operators responsible for the umklapp scattering terms relevant .",
    "consequently , the gaps for collective excitations generated by such operators are not exponentially small , as it would be away from half filling , but have power - law dependence on the umklapp scattering matrix elements .",
    "such enhancement of the gaps increases chances for their experimental observation .",
    "unfortunately , in their further analysis the authors of @xcite resorted to renormalization group ( rg ) equations , which for systems with many fields do not provide much insight into the properties at the strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "rg equations also do not take into account the drastic difference between velocities of the plasma modes and all other collective excitations . instead of adding difficulties",
    ", however , the difference in velocities leads to considerable simplifications in actual calculations ( see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we shall exploit this feature to our advantage and develop an approach based on the adiabatic approximation similar to the one used for the problem of electron - phonon interaction . as a result we will be able to provide a rather detailed information about the spectrum and the phase diagram of the system .",
    "as will be shown below , the interplay of the long range coulomb interaction and umklapp processes at half filling gives rise to a phase diagram which includes several interesting strongly correlated states .",
    "the system has a hidden z@xmath0z@xmath0z@xmath1 symmetry and these phases are conveniently classified as different symmetry breaking patterns of this group .",
    "to warm up , let us first recall the problem of the unscreened coulomb interaction for a single chain ( or a single channel quantum wire ) at half - filling .",
    "the charge and spin sectors decouple ; the tomonaga - luttinger liquid hamiltonian for the charge sector should be supplemented by the umklapp term which contains only the charge field @xmath2 : = ua_0(r^+_l_r^+_l _ + h.c . ) = , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 fourier component of the interaction .",
    "the full hamiltonian density for the charge sector is @xmath5 , where & & h_0 = + & & v(x ) = v^2(x ) + [ h0 ] @xmath6 being the fermi velocity .",
    "this model is very close to the sine - gordon one .",
    "the spectrum contains solitons and their bound states ( breathers or excitons ) . to get their spectrum one can just expand the cosine around its minimum and obtain : ^2 = ( vq)^2 + m_b^2 , [ omega ] where the breather gap is @xmath7 .",
    "the breathers are effectively optical phonons of the one - dimensional wigner crystal @xcite .",
    "the soliton gap is larger ; it was estimated in @xcite , a better estimate is m_s = [ 1 + ( 2e^2/v)(v / m_sa_0 ) ] the spectrum in the spin sector is gapless , and the spin velocity is approximately @xmath6 . thus already for a simple one - chain problem ,",
    "the long - distant coulomb force brings three important new features : ( i ) strong upward renormalization of the charge velocity seen in eq.([omega ] ) , and ( ii ) the presence of exciton modes in the charge sector , ( iii ) power law dependence of the mass scales @xmath8 on the umklapp matrix element @xmath9 .",
    "swcns are manufactured by wrapping two - dimensional graphite sheets into cylinders ( compactification ) .",
    "the electronic spectrum of an infinite graphite sheet contains two dirac cones with different chirality , centered at different points of the brillouin zone ( the blue dots on fig .",
    "1 ) . under compactification",
    "the spectrum is divided into subbands corresponding to different quantized values of the transverse momentum . in the so - called armchair nanotubes @xmath10",
    "remains an eigevalue and the spectrum in the lowest subband stays gapless ; at half filling it is also doubly degenerate at low energies .",
    "this degeneracy is a vestige of the double - cone structure of the two - dimensional dispersion .",
    "we discuss the spectrum in some detail in appendix a ; more detailed information can be obtained from the book @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    in appendix b we derive the bosonized form of the effective low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "the total hamiltonian density is = h_0[_^(+ ) ] + _ a+ v [ h ] where @xmath11 is given by eq.([h0 ] ) ; @xmath12 is the symmetric charge mode .",
    "the label @xmath13 takes three values , @xmath14 , corresponding to the antisymmetric charge field and symmetric and antisymmetric spin fields , respectively ( see appendix a ) . the interaction density",
    "@xmath15 contains umklapp terms & & v = -(_^(+ ) ) + & & [ g_c(_^(- ) ) + ( g_3 - g_1)(_s^(+ ) ) + g_3(_s^(- ) ) - g_1(_s^(- ) ) ] + & & +  [ tunn ] where the dots stand for all other terms that do not involve @xmath12 and stay marginal even in the presence of the unscreened coulomb intreraction .",
    "the couplings @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined by the lattice hamiltonian . in appendix",
    "b we estimate them for realistic carbon nanotubes , where , as it turns out , @xmath19 and , hence , there are only two independent coupling constants .",
    "the unscreened coulomb interaction strongly reduces the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath20 in the long - wavelength limit , making it smaller than 1 .",
    "thus the umklapp terms ( [ tunn ] ) become strongly relevant , with the scaling dimension almost equal to 1 .",
    "this circumstance dramatically increases the values of the gaps .",
    "one may well expect that the double degeneracy of the electron band in carbon nanotubes makes the problem similar to the problem of two interacting chains ( the ladder problem ) much discussed in literature .",
    "this is indeed the case . to put the problem in a broader context ,",
    "let us discuss two extreme types of ladders : ( i ) the ones where two chains are placed far apart such that there is no direct tunneling between them , and ( ii ) those in which the interchain tunneling is stronger than all the interactions .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ h],[tunn ] ) is formally equivalent to the first case describing two well separated chains . as a matter of fact",
    ", the hamiltonian for case ( ii ) is not very different .",
    "the calculations done in @xcite for the ladder with strong interchain tunneling yields the same hamiltonian as ( [ tunn ] ) , but with @xmath21 field being substituted by its dual counterpart , @xmath22 : _",
    "b = v_a[_,-_,- ] [ notunn ] therefore one expects that the two models have the same excitation spectrum though the response functions are different due to the different field identification .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ tunn ] ) is not very convenient to analyse in its bosonic form since the effective potential contains mutually nonlocal and noncommuting fields , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the physics becomes significantly more transparent when one uses the refermionization procedure @xcite,@xcite .",
    "fermionizing all the fields except of @xmath12 we obtain & & h = h_0[_^(+ ) ] + v(- r^_f _ x r_f + l^_f _ x l_f ) + _ a = 0 ^ 3(-_r^a_x_r^a + _",

    "notice that eq.([model ] ) is manifestly su(2)-symmetric .",
    "the triplet of majorana fermions ( @xmath29 ) transform according to the spin s=1 representation of the su(2 ) group , whereas the fermion labeled by @xmath30 is a singlet under the su(2 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we shall handle hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) using the adiabatic approximation , whose validity is guaranteed by the fact that the velocity in the symmetric charge sector is strongly enhanced by the long - distant coulomb interaction with respect to the bare fermi velocity .",
    "the results have certain similarity with the su(4 ) theory proposed in @xcite , but also contain important differences , which we shall discuss .",
    "thus , from the @xmath12-mode point of view , the other degrees of freedom are static .",
    "integrating over this mode , one obtains an effective potential for the fermions in the form of the ground state energy of the sine - gordon model .",
    "according to @xcite the energy density is proportional to the square of the breather mass @xmath31 of such sine - gordon model and in the regime of small sine - gordon coupling constant @xmath32 is equal to e - - v/(v_c ) [ g_c(r^_f l_f - h.c . )",

    "the fermionic modes acquire gaps : m _ , - = ,   m_,t = ,   m_,s = [ masses ] they correspond to neutral excitations with the quantum numbers given in the table that follows ; see also fig.2 .",
    "as far as the fast modes are concerned , one has to treat differently the ones with and without electric charge .",
    "the neutral modes do not involve solitons of field @xmath12 .",
    "one can get a good estimate of their spectrum replacing the term in the square brackets in expression for the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) by a constant and expanding around the minimum of the cosine potential . as a result one gets the same spectrum as for the single chain ( [ omega ] ) with m_b^2 = ( m_,-^2 + 3m_,t^2 + m_,s^2)(v/ ) where with the logarithmic accuracy @xmath35 is either @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",

    "however , as we have already mentioned , its validity is already assured by the difference in the velocities .",

    "the estimates of interaction matrix elements for carbon nanotubes are provided in @xcite : & & g_i = _ i ,   i = c , t , s & & _ c 0.4 ,  _ t 0.5 ,  _ s - 1.3 where @xmath129 is the number of transverse bands of the nanotube and @xmath130 is the dielectric constant .",
    "this estimates indicate that realistic nanotubes belong to phase b. eq.([masses ] ) also gives the following estimates for the spectral gaps of the collective modes : |m_i| = |_i| since @xmath131 is the short distance cut - off of the bosonic theory and is therefore non universal , this formula contains a certain degree of ambiguity . for noninteracting electrons @xmath132 ( the lattice spacing ) .",
    "taking @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 nm we get the estimate of order of 0.1 ev .",
    "the single particle gaps should be even greater .    since the gaps should be quite sizeable , one may wonder whether they have not been already observed .",
    "the existing techniques produce simultaneously carbon nanotubes of different sizes and chiralities and one has to select the relevant ones using some criteria .",
    "the simplest one is to differ between metallic and insulating ( semiconductor ) nanotubes .",
    "naturally , on the first glance mott and band insulators look alike .",
    "therefore it is possible that the mott insulating armchair nanotubes have been overlooked being taken for semiconducting ones . to distinguish mott insulator from a band one",
    "one has to measure transport and magnetic properties and compare the gaps .",
    "the clearest sign of mottness is the difference in gap sizes in different response functions .",
    "this is the feature to look for experimentally .",

    "he also acknowledges the support from the institute for theory of strongly correlated and complex systems at brookhaven .      the original hamiltonian describing noninteracting electrons on a honeycomb lattice can be compactly written in the two - sublattice ( nambu ) representation : h_0 = _ * k * ^_*k * h(*k * ) _ * k * , [ ham - nambu ] where _ * k * & = & (          ) , + t(*k * ) & = & 1 + 2(k_x/2)^(3/2)k_y , and the sum in ( [ ham - nambu ] ) goes over the brillouin zone .",
    "the spectrum has two degeneracy points ( nodes ) at @xmath136 . linearizing the noninteracting hamiltonian near these points yields two cones associated with ( 2 + 1)-dimensional massless dirac fermions : ( * q*_1,2 + * p * ) = v(_y p_y _ x p_x ) ,  v = 3 t/2 .",
    "when a two - dimensional sheet of graphite is wrapped to produce an armchair nanotube , @xmath137 gets quantized , and the lowest - energy subband correspoding to @xmath10 stays gapless .",
    "the resulting problem is one - dimensional because the wave function does not depend on @xmath118 . projecting the fermionic annihilation operators of the @xmath13 and @xmath49 sublattices onto the @xmath10 subspace",
    ", we get : (                the effective 1d hamiltonian is brought to its canonical diagonal form h_0 = - v _ j=1,2 x   ( r^_j _ x r_j - l^_j _ x l_j ) by linear transformations : & & r_1 = ( r_1 + l_1)/2 ,   l_1 = ( - r_1 + l_1)/2 + & & r_2 = ( r_2 - l_2)/2 ,   l_2 = ( r_2 + l_2)/2 [ trans ] the structure of these transformations reflects the fact that different dirac points , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , are not associated with fermions of different chiralities , as it is the case for standard chains and ladders ; instead each of these points is characterized by a pair of right @xmath140 and left @xmath141 fields .",
    "this is because the gapless spectrum of the armchair nanotube keeps the memory of the two - cone dirac structure of the dispersion law in the 2d graphite ( in fact , the 1d spectrum is obtained from the 2d one by cutting the two cones by the plane @xmath51 ) . for this reason , in case of nanotubes , smooth components of the physical fields are contributed not only by the diagonal `` currents '' , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , but also by off - diagonal `` mass bilinears '' , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .        )",
