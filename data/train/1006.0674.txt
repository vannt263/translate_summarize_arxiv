    "various cosmological observations , including the type ia supernova  @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite and the large scale structure  @xcite , et al . , have revealed that the universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion and it entered this accelerating phase only in the near past .",
    "this unexpected observed phenomenon poses one of the most puzzling problems in cosmology today .",
    "usually , it is assumed that there exists , in our universe , an exotic energy component with negative pressure , named dark energy , which dominates the universe and drives it to an accelerating expansion at recent times .",
    "many candidates of dark energy have been proposed , such as the cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , quintom as well as the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas , and so on . however , alternatively , one can take this observed accelerating expansion as a signal of the breakdown of our understanding to the laws of gravitation and , thus , a modification of the gravity theory is needed .",
    "one of the most popular modified gravity models is obtained by generalizing the spacetime curvature scalar @xmath12 in the einstein - hilbert action in general relativity to a general function of @xmath12 .",
    "the theory so obtained is called as the @xmath13 theory ( see @xcite for recent review ) .",
    "recently , a new modified gravity by extending the teleparallel gravity  @xcite is proposed to account for the present accelerating expansion  @xcite .",
    "differing from general relativity using the levi - civita connection , in teleparallel gravity , the weitzenbck connection is used . as a result",
    ", the spacetime has only torsion and thus is curvature - free .",
    "similar to general relativity where the action is a curvature scalar , the action of teleparallel gravity is a torsion scalar @xmath1 . in analogy to the @xmath13 theory , bengochea and ferraro suggested , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new model , named @xmath0 theory , by generalizing the action of teleparallel gravity , and found that it can explain the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "let us also note here that models based on modified teleparallel gravity may also provide an alternative to inflation  @xcite .",
    "another advantage the generalized @xmath0 torsion theory has is that its field equations are second order as opposed to the fourth order equations of f(r ) theory .",
    "more recently , linder proposed two new @xmath0 models to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion  @xcite and found that the @xmath0 theory can unify a number of interesting extensions of gravity beyond general relativity . in this letter",
    ", we plan to first perform a statefinder analysis and an @xmath14 diagnostic to these models and then discuss the constraints on them from the latest observational data , including the type ia supernovae released by the supernova cosmology project collaboration , the baryonic acoustic oscillation from the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey , and the cosmic microwave background radiation from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe seven year observation .",
    "we find that for both models the crossing of the @xmath15 line is impossible .",
    "this is consistent with what obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in conflict with the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where a crossing is found for the exponential model .",
    "in this section , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we briefly review the @xmath0 theory .",
    "we start with teleparallel gravity where the action is the torsion scalar @xmath1 defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the torsion tensor @xmath18 and @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the orthonormal tetrad component , where @xmath21 is an index running over @xmath22 for the tangent space of the manifold , while @xmath23 , also running over @xmath22 , is the coordinate index on the manifold .",
    "the spacetime metric is related to @xmath20 through @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the contorsion tensor given by @xmath26    by assuming a flat homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker universe which is described by the metric @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scale factor , one has , from eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) , @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the hubble parameter .    in order to explain the late time cosmic accelerating expansion without the need of dark energy , linder , following ref .",
    "@xcite , generalized the lagrangian density in teleparallel gravity by promoting @xmath1 to be @xmath31 .",
    "the modified friedmann equation then becomes @xmath32 @xmath33 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath34 , @xmath35 is energy density and @xmath36 is the pressure . here",
    "we assume that the energy component in the universe is only matter with radiation neglected , thus @xmath37 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ mf ] , [ mf2 ] ) , we can define an effective dark energy , whose energy density and the equation of state can be expressed , respectively , as @xmath38 @xmath39    some models are proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion , which satisfy the usual condition @xmath40 at the high redshift in order to be consistent with the primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background constraints . here",
    "we consider two models proposed by linder  @xcite :    @xmath41 model 1 @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two model parameters . using the modified friedmann equation , one can obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dimensionless matter density today . substituting above expression into the modified friedmann equation and defining @xmath47 , one has @xmath48",
    "let us note that this model has the same background evolution equation as some phenomenological models  @xcite and it reduces to the @xmath10cdm model when @xmath49 , and to the dgp model  @xcite when @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath51 , the friedmann equation ( eq .  ( [ mf ] ) ) can be rewritten as @xmath52 , which is the same as that of a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model if we rescale the newton s constant as @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain an accelerating expansion , it is required that @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath41 model 2 @xmath55 which is similar to a @xmath13 model where an exponential dependence on the curvature scalar is proposed  @xcite . using the modified friedmann equation again",
    ", we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 it is easy to see that @xmath58 corresponds to the case of @xmath10cdm .",
    "in order to discriminate different dark energy models from each other , sanhi et al . proposed a geometrical diagnostic method by adding higher derivatives of the scale factor  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "two parameters @xmath59 , named statefinder parameters , are used , which are defined , respectively , as @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the decelerating parameter .",
    "apparently , @xmath10cdm model corresponds to a point @xmath63 in @xmath59 phase space .",
    "the statefinder diagnostic can discriminate different models . for example , it can distinguish quintom from other dark energy models  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 is a new diagnostic of dark energy proposed by sahni et al .",
    "it is defined as @xmath64 apparently , this diagnostic only depends on the first derivative of the luminosity @xmath65 ( see eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) ) .",
    "thus , its advantage , as opposed to the equation of state of dark energy , is that it is less sensitive to the observational errors and the present matter energy density @xmath66 .",
    "one can use this diagnostic to discriminate different dark energy models by examining the slope of @xmath2 even if the value of @xmath66 is not exactly known , since the positive , null , or negative slopes correspond to @xmath67 or @xmath68 , respectively .",

    "the left panels show the evolutionary curves of statefinder pair @xmath71 , the middle panels are the evolutionary curves of pair @xmath69 , and the right panels are the @xmath2 diagnostic .",
    "although , both model 1 and model 2 evolve from the scdm to a de sitter ( ds ) phase as one can see from the middle panels of these figures , the effective dark energy for model 2 with @xmath72 is similar to a cosmological constant both in the high redshift regimes and in the future , while for model 1 with @xmath73 this similarity occurs only in the future .    as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a simple power law evolution of the scale factor @xmath74 , one has @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a phantom - like dark energy corresponds to @xmath77 , a quintessence - like dark energy to @xmath78 , and an evolution from phantom to quintessence or inverse is given by a crossing of the point @xmath79 in @xmath59 phase plane .",
