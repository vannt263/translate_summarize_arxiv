    "the last passage percolation process has been widely studied over the last few years  @xcite .",
    "there are several equivalent physical interpretations for the model .",
    "examples include zero - temperature directed polymer in a random environment , a certain growth process , queuing theory , a randomly increasing young diagram and random partitions  @xcite . by a simple coupling argument , results obtained for last passage percolation have their duals for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process and thus the former model is often useful for the study of the later one  @xcite .",
    "it is for the two - dimensional case that the most explicit results and estimates are known . in particular for geometric or exponential distributions , to which an exact solution was given by  @xcite .",
    "in this note we study last passage percolation with exponentially distributed passage times in the presence of macroscopic inhomogeneity .",
    "we begin by restating known results with a different point of view : instead of taking the limit of a large rectangle on the usual lattice we consider the limit of a fine lattice on some fixed rectangle , which is equivalent but resembles hydrodynamics .",
    "a continuous function @xmath0 is defined on the macroscopic rectangle and locally modifies the parameter of the process .",
    "the problem of studying the random microscopic path of maximal passage time leads to the variational problem of finding a deterministic macroscopic curve maximizing a certain functional .",
    "we shall see that the rescaled passage time indeed converges to that given by the variational problem , and give sufficient analytical conditions for convergence of the maximal path s shape to a deterministic curve .",
    "the viewpoint adopted here has immediate implications for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process . on the scaling limit",
    "we can describe the behavior of the total current through the origin up to a given time when the jump rate has macroscopic fluctuations in space ( as well as in blocks of particles , or even both ) .",
    "in particular for spatial inhomogeneity it is easy to see that the instantaneous current is non increasing in time .",
    "the analysis of the time taken for a given amount of particles to cross the origin and of the corresponding path that gives that passage time helps understanding the bottleneck , that is , which chain of events was responsible for that delay .",
    "the relation with tasep will be discussed further in section  [ sec : tasep ] .",
    "the last passage percolation problem may be formulated as follows .",
    "given the origin and a point @xmath1 , @xmath2 , consider the rectangle @xmath3 , that is , the rectangle like displayed in figure  [ fig : strips ] having @xmath4 and @xmath5 as vertices . for @xmath6 , take the grid @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",

    "let @xmath15 denote the set of oriented paths @xmath16 crossing @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the rightmost point of @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath23 , we define @xmath24 as the sum of the random variables @xmath13 for @xmath25 , i.e. , the total value of the rewards along that path .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the ( a.s .",
    "unique ) path that maximizes @xmath24 and let @xmath27 .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the maximal value @xmath28 approaches @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , as @xmath31 increases .",
    "moreover , the probability of deviating @xmath32 from this limit decays exponentially fast in @xmath31 .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that the maximal path @xmath26 approaches the straight line connecting the origin and @xmath5 in the @xmath33 .",
    "we now describe how the macroscopic inhomogeneity is introduced .",

    "we are interested in understanding the value of @xmath28 and the shape of @xmath26 for large values of @xmath31 .",
    "let us give some simple heuristic arguments .",

    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath53 will approach @xmath54 when @xmath55 sufficiently fast and @xmath56 .",
    "informally we say that that the maximal path @xmath39 , restricted to be pinned to the curve @xmath40 , will asymptotically catch a total of @xmath54 in rewards .",
    "now drop this restriction , i.e. , take the maximal path among all possible paths instead of being pinned to some specific curve @xmath40 .",
    "we guess @xmath28 will be given by maximizing over @xmath40 , that is , @xmath57    our first result confirms the above argument .",

    "it is clear that the variational problem defining @xmath64 is crucial for the understanding of the process .",
    "uniqueness of its maximizer is required in order to establish convergence of the maximal paths .",
    "although one can easily build a function @xmath0 for which two distinct curves maximize @xmath64 , the authors believe that the set of @xmath0 s for which @xmath65 is unique is generic in the @xmath66 topology .",
    "the next result concerns the shape of the maximal path .",
    "[ theo : path ] for @xmath0 continuous there is @xmath67 such that @xmath68 . if such @xmath65 is unique , the random maximal path @xmath26 approaches the curve @xmath65 for @xmath31 large .",

    "of course uniqueness holds whenever @xmath75 is strictly concave . when @xmath0 is smooth , a sufficient condition for strict concavity of @xmath75 is @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .    in section  [ sec : convergence ]",

    "section  [ sec : concave ] contains the proofs of theorem  [ theo : path ] and the sufficiency of the condition  ( [ eq : strongconcavity ] ) . in section  [ sec : tasep ] we discuss some implications of these results for the tasep .",
    "the authors believe that it is possible to prove similar results for the case of geometric distribution of passage times and for the case of non - homogeneous poissonian points with the same arguments presented in this note .

    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referees , whose suggestions have considerably simplified and improved our exposition .",
    "in this section we sketch the proof of theorem  [ theo : sup ] .",
    "the proof consists on approximating @xmath0 by a constant on smaller regions of the domain @xmath34 and then applying the large deviation principle known to hold on these regions .",

    "in this section we present the proofs of theorem  [ theo : path ] and the sufficiency of  ( [ eq : strongconcavity ] ) for uniqueness .",
    "we first address the question of existence of a maximizer @xmath65 . by ascoli - arzel",
    ", @xmath76 is a compact space with the uniform topology .",
    "however , @xmath75 is not a continuous functional in that topology ( notice that @xmath54 is defined in terms of the derivative of @xmath40 , which exists a.e . in @xmath140",

    "nevertheless the proof will follow by compactness , since the @xmath75 is upper semi - continuous , as we prove now .",

    "since @xmath143 is a concave function , it follows from jensen s inequality that @xmath144 for every @xmath145 , so it remains to show that @xmath146 for all @xmath40 .",

    "write @xmath151 the first term vanishes as @xmath150 by the bounded convergence theorem .",
    "the second term vanishes as @xmath152 for @xmath153 fixed , since for smooth @xmath40 the numbers @xmath154 indeed correspond to riemann sums of a continuous integrand along the path @xmath155 .",
    "it thus suffices to show that the last term goes to zero uniformly in @xmath145 as @xmath150 . since @xmath156 for all @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 where the second inequality is jensen s inequality for the square root and @xmath160 denotes @xmath161 .",
    "this proves that @xmath75 is upper semi - continuous , therefore there is a @xmath65 attaining @xmath162 .",
    "we now discuss the convergence of @xmath26 to @xmath65 when this is the unique maximizer .",
    "it follows from uniqueness of @xmath65 and upper semi - continuity that @xmath163 this , together with the exponentially fast convergence in probability given by theorem  [ theo : sup ] , implies the desired result .",
    "suppose @xmath0 has continuous derivatives and consider the euler - lagrange problem  ( [ eq : edo ] ) .",
    "for a given @xmath164 function @xmath88 with @xmath165 , it is easy to see that  ( [ eq : edo ] ) holds if and only if @xmath166 for every smooth perturbation @xmath167 that vanishes on the extremes of the interval . rewrite  ( [ eq : edo ] ) as @xmath168 \\\\",

    "existence , uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions on the initial condition @xmath171 follow from basic ode theory .",
    "now notice that for @xmath172 we have @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "so , for given @xmath175 , by the intermediate value theorem there is @xmath176 for which the corresponding solution @xmath74 satisfies @xmath177 .",
    "since @xmath178 is an invariant set , @xmath74 must satisfy @xmath179 .",
    "therefore there is at least one solution @xmath180 of  ( [ eq : edo ] ) .",
    "finally we show that when @xmath75 is strictly concave , the solution @xmath74 is unique and it is also the unique maximizer of @xmath75 .",
    "we simply adapt a standard method for showing that a critical point of concave functional must be the unique maximizer .",
    "let @xmath180 be a solution of  ( [ eq : edo ] ) .",
    "suppose there were @xmath181 with @xmath182 . by the strict concavity , there is @xmath183 such that @xmath184 .",

    "the concavity of @xmath75 implies @xmath188 , where @xmath189 , a contradiction .",
    "therefore @xmath74 is the unique maximizer of @xmath75 in @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath74 was taken as any solution of the contour value problem , this must be the unique solution .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem  [ theo : path ] .",
    "we end this section showing that  ( [ eq : strongconcavity ] ) is sufficient for @xmath75 to be strictly concave .",
    "let @xmath190 be fixed and define @xmath191 .",
    "what we shall actually prove is that the function @xmath192 is strictly concave , which is much stronger than the functional @xmath75 having this property .",

    "since @xmath197 it is enough to require  ( [ eq : strongconcavity ] ) to have the strict concavity of @xmath192 and consequently of @xmath75 .",
    "the last passage percolation model can be coupled with the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with the initial condition that the sites are occupied iff they lie to the left of the origin .",
    "see  @xcite for a description of such correspondence .",
    "the current through the origin for the tasep can be understood by considering last passage percolation between @xmath4 and @xmath198 , since this gives the rescaled time needed for @xmath199 particles to cross the origin . at the scaling limit this converges to @xmath200 $ ] .",
    "the model considered in the previous sections can describe , for example , the tasep with the jump rates depending smoothly on the position of each site , when we take @xmath0 depending on @xmath40 . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", the instantaneous current through the origin will be a decreasing function of the time .",
    "intuitively , as the time passes , the process finds more bottlenecks that were not important before , and at some point such barriers start being determinant for the passage time , at least until the system meets even narrower bottlenecks .",
    "the above fact follows easily from the variational formulation of @xmath75 .",
    "consider for instance the graph of @xmath203 having two peaks as in figure  [ fig : tasep1 ] .",
    "for short times the system dynamics does not feel the existence of such regions of large average jump time , so @xmath200 $ ] ( i.e. , the time needed for @xmath204 particles to cross the origin , at the scaling limit ) grows linearly with @xmath202 as in the homogeneous case . for larger times",
    "the first peak will become important : there will be a traffic jam before this point and the rescaled time @xmath200 $ ] will increase roughly linearly with @xmath202 , but at bigger rate , given by the value of @xmath0 at this peak .",
    "now for even larger times again the system finds a harder difficulty to overcome , which is to wait for particles to cross the stronger bottleneck given by the second peak , leading to a low density of particles flowing through the origin , so from this time on @xmath200 $ ] increases at an even higher rate , again given by the value of @xmath0 at the new peak .",
    "the curves shown in figure  [ fig : tasep1 ] give the maximizers @xmath201 of @xmath200 $ ] , for @xmath202 in these three regions , illustrating the decreasing of instantaneous current .",
    "for a proof of this phenomenon notice that the instantaneous current being non increasing is equivalent to saying that the amount of time needed for a certain flux to pass by the origin is a convex function .",
    "now the following inequality implies that @xmath205 $ ] is convex .",
