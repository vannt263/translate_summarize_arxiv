    "it should be dominated by neutron stars , but the number of isolated black holes ( ibhs ) is also non - negligible : their number is @xmath7 @xcite . taking into account this large number , the local spatial density of ibh can be high , corresponding to a typical distance to the closest objects @xmath8tens of parsec .",
    "such estimates are usually based on detailed calculations for isolated neutron stars and normalization based on the relative number of compact objects .",

    "the relative number of bhs to neutron stars is about 1/3 .",
    "then , the local density of ibhs can be taken as @xmath12  pc@xmath10 .",
    "historically , the first ideas about the detectability of ibh were related to accretion from the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "detailed studies concluded that accreting ibh must emit mostly in x - rays and ir ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "calculations of the observability of the population of galactic accreting ibhs were performed several times ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most detailed studies was presented by @xcite . despite several attempts @xcite ,",
    "up to now no firm candidates for accreting ibhs ( or for accreting isolated neutron stars , see @xcite ) are known .",
    "optimistically , future space missions may discover them @xcite .",
    "the only possible detections of ibhs reported in recent years are related to microlensing .",
    "about 10 years ago several candidates were reported by different research groups @xcite .",
    "recent calculations @xcite predict that further compact objects will be detected via microlensing .",
    "to understand ibhs better , it is very important to seek examples of these not related to microlensing events .",
    "there is a discovery potential for ibhs via modelling of disrupted massive binaries @xcite , or in a close examination of unidentified objects with peculiar properties among different surveys . in this note",
    "we develop the idea of @xcite who proposed that bhs with spherical accretion  i.e. without formation of an accretion disk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* )  can be sources of relativistic jets powered by rotating bh @xcite or , e.g. , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "these jets form conditions for efficient acceleration of non - thermal particles which can radiate energetic electrons , with quite low luminosity in x - ray and other energy bands .",
    "strict limits on the energy release rate in x - rays @xmath13 ( in units of the bondi - hoyle accretion rate with efficiency @xmath14 ) was achieved in the work of @xcite , which is complimentary to the scenario suggested by @xcite .    in the following two sections",
    "we briefly describe the model .",
    "then , in sec.[obs ] we present our results on the possible observational appearance of ibhs .",
    "finally , we present some discussion and our conclusions .",
    "recently , it was shown that the bz mechanism can be activated in the case of direct wind accretion on to a rotating bh in a close binary system @xcite .",
    "thus , a relatively powerful jet , with kinetic luminosity of @xmath15 , can be launched in systems which do not feature an accretion disk .",
    "a similar situation may arise in the case of accretion of the ism on to an ibh .",
    "accretion from the ism has been studied for many decades starting from the seminal papers by @xcite ( see a review in @xcite ) .",
    "the case of ibhs was studied in @xcite and later this approach was developed in @xcite .    in the simplest case",
    ", the accretion rate can be estimated as : @xmath16 here m is the mass of an accretion source , @xmath17 is the density of the surrounding medium ( the ism density in our case ) , and @xmath18 is a dimensionless coefficient @xmath19 . the velocity @xmath20 must include the contribution from different types of motion .",
    "the most important is just a spatial velocity of the accreting object , @xmath21 .",
    "when this is small it is necessary to take into account the sound speed in the medium .",
    "typically , the sound speed in the ism is @xmath22  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "spatial velocities are larger , since progenitor stars have typical velocity distribution of gaussian shape with @xmath24  km  s@xmath23 , and the direction of the bh birth kick is not expected to be related to the direction of the progenitor star s spacial velocity .",
    "thus , in this study we assume that the typical velocities of ibhs are about several tens of km per second ( perhaps as high as hundreds km per second , similar to the values typical for neutron stars , see @xcite ) , and consequently the additional contribution due to the ism sound speed can be neglected .",
    "the rate of matter capture can be estimated from eq.([bondi ] ) as @xmath25 here @xmath26 , @xmath27  km  s@xmath23   @xmath28  km  s@xmath23 , @xmath29  g  cm@xmath10 are the mass of an ibh , the peculiar velocity of the ibh and the density of the ism , respectively .. ] since ibhs are not expected to be powerful sources , we mostly focus on the most nearby locations @xcite .",
    "this allows the ism density to be estimated .",
    "namely , currently the solar system is located in the _ local interstellar cloud _ , which is expected to have particle density of @xmath31  proton  cm@xmath10 , or equivalently @xmath32 .",
    "the surrounding region , the so - called the _ local bubble _",
    ", is characterized by a much smaller density , @xmath33 .",
    "finally , at distances @xmath34 from the solar system there is a number of _ molecular clouds _ ( mc ) which may have rather high density @xmath35 . therefore , unless the bh proper velocity differs significantly from @xmath36 , the expected accretion rates for the lic , lb and mc are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .    in the cases that the accretion regime differs from bondi - hoyle accretion",
    ", the rate can be even smaller .",
    "in particular , for low velocity ibhs , @xmath40  km  s@xmath23 , a temporary disk can be formed due to interstellar turbulence @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate in this case can be slightly smaller than the bondi value @xcite due to the formation of a wind outflow from the accretion disk .",
    "however , such disks are expected to be transient on a time - scale @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the so - called bondi radius : @xmath43 and @xmath44 thus , for realistic cases , this time - scale is very short , @xmath45  yr . therefore in what follows we adopt the values obtained for the bondi accretion regime .    in the model by @xcite a jet is driven by the bz mechanism .",
    "the total power in the jet can be estimated by a simple numerical relationship @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a non - dimensional parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath49 can be achieved if high enough magnetic flux can be accumulated at the bh horizon .",
    "the required magnetic field flux can be obtained through the following relation @xcite : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is magnetic flux in units @xmath52  g  @xmath53 . the function@xmath54 is a dimensionless function accounting for the bh rotation ) it will last up to @xmath55  years , so we can neglect the ibh braking . ] . combining eqs.([lbzn ] ) and ( [ lbzp ] ) and adopting @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) , one can derive the magnetic flux value on bh horizon , required for the optimal operation of the bz mechanism : @xmath58 the value of @xmath59 which an ibh can accumulate by bondi accretion is @xmath60 or @xmath61 therefore , in the case of accretion of the ism matter on to an ibh the bz mechanism can achieve its optimal performance provided by eq .",
    "( [ lbzn ] ) .",
    "however , we note that there are some uncertainties related to role of the reconnection and magnetic flux escape from the horizon of an ibh .",
    "thus , for the expected accretion rates , the ibh might be characterized by a jet with a luminosity of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the cases of bhs located in lic , lb and mc , respectively . given the dependence of the jet luminosity on different factors , e.g. , the accretion rate , on the magnetic field at the horizon , spin and velocity of the ibh , these luminosities can be , in fact , considered as upper limits .",
    "another important issue is related to the actual number of such ibhs in the ism with different properties . for the above estimates",
    "there should be @xmath65 located within @xmath66  pc from the solar system .",
    "for the expected size of the lic of @xmath67 , this yields a probability of @xmath68 for a bh to be located there . with increasing @xmath69 the number of bhs rises rapidly achieving @xmath70 inside @xmath71  kpc .",
    "on the other hand , ibhs in high density regions are rare : they are at least two orders of magnitude less frequent than ibhs in the normal and low - density ism .",
    "a typical mc with @xmath72 has a volume @xmath73  pc@xmath74 .",
    "i.e. , for the ibh spatial density close to the galactic plane @xmath75  pc@xmath10 , we expect one ibh per cloud . on larger scales",
    ", the number of ibhs located in mcs might be very significant .",
    "given , however , the presence of pulsars on this scale , the impact of ibhs is negligibly small .",
    "for example , the vela pulsar is located at a distance of 290  pc , and is expected to be a powerful source of cosmic ray ( cr ) leptons with power comparable to its spin - down luminosity , @xmath76 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the closest ibh in a cloud is expected at a distance @xmath77    200  pc ( see the list of near - by mcs , for example in @xcite ) . up to @xmath78  pc only @xmath79 ibhs are expected to be located in mcs .",
    "non - thermal processes in bh jets can be linked to shocks at the head of the jet . a system consisting of two shocks",
    "is expected to be formed : a forward shock propagating through the ism and a relativistic reverse shock in the jet matter .",
    "these shocks are characterized by very different velocities .",
    "properties of the non - thermal particles accelerated by these shocks may differ significantly therefore .",
    "the jet power and medium density determines the key properties of the forward shock .",
    "namely , the jet ram pressure should be balanced by the inertia of the ism .",
    "this yields the following relation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the jet ram pressure and the radius of the termination shock , respectively .",
    "the latter can be estimated as r_s310 ^ 15 l_j,31 ^ 1/2_-24 ^ -1/2_1.5 ^ -1 cm .",
    "[ eq : shock ] an upper limit on the forward shock magnetic field strength can be derived from pressure balance @xmath83 : b_s15_-24 ^ 1/2_1.5 .",
    "[ eq : forward_b ]    the reverse shock in the jet has a similar size and , in fact , its magnetic field strength should be comparable .",
    "indeed , since jets launched by the bz mechanism are magnetically dominated , the magnetic field strength can be estimated as b_j=1r_s .",
    "this allows one to obtain the following relation : b_jr_s=10 ^ 11 m_1 ^ 1/2_1.5 ^ -3/2_-24 ^ 1/2c_-1 ^ 1/2 gcm . for the shock size @xmath82 determined by eq.([eq : shock ] ) , this yields a magnetic field of b_j=10 _ -24 ^ 1/2_1.5 , [ eq : b_j ] which is quite close to the strength expected at the forward shock eq.([eq : forward_b ] ) . the main difference between these two shocks",
    "is related to the efficiency of the acceleration process .",
    "the acceleration time of non - thermal particles can be estimated as t_acc = r_gc here @xmath84 is electron giro - radius , and @xmath85 is a dimensionless parameter , which in the case of diffusive shock acceleration has a value of @xmath86 . in the case of the forward termination shock ,",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath87 . in the case of the reverse shock , which is expected",
    "be characterized by relativistic velocities , the value of @xmath88-parameter is not defined in the framework of theoretical models . however , from the interpretation of the non - thermal emission detected from the crab nebula , one can infer that in the relativistic case @xmath89 , thus in what follows we will assume @xmath90 .    in the case of diffusive shock acceleration the maximum energy of the non - thermal particles",
    "can be limited either by loss rate or by the confinement requirement .",
    "the latter is refereed to as the _ hillas criterion _",
    "@xcite , which for the bohm diffusion regime ( i.e. , the diffusion coefficient is @xmath91 ) can be formulated as a limitation of the size of the acceleration site @xmath92 : r_acc > r_g . in the asymptotic case",
    "@xmath93 so this condition results in an obvious requirement of @xmath94 . since in the case of the jet termination @xmath95 ,",
    "the electrons can be accelerated up to e_max , f < 5 c_-1 ^ 1/2_-24 ^ 1/2m_1 ^ 1/2_1.5 ^ -1 gev .",
    "[ eq : emax ] this value gives @xmath96  gev for the local cloud , and @xmath97  gev for a bh located in the local bubble . in the case of a bh in a mc ,",
    "the maximum energy achieved at the jet termination shock is @xmath98  gev .",
    "therefore , the jet forward termination shock is not a plausible acceleration site for any reasonable conditions .",
    "regarding the reverse shock , the hillas criterion gives the following estimate : e_max , r < 30 c_-1 ^ 1/2_-24 ^ 1/2m_1 ^ 1/2_1.5 ^ -3/2_1 ^ -1/2 tev .",
    "this gives @xmath99  tev for the local cloud , and @xmath45  tev for bh located in the local bubble . in the case of an ibh in a mc",
    ", the maximum energy of particles accelerated at the jet termination shock is @xmath45  pev .",
    "the acceleration process is limited by the hillas criterion , therefore the particles are not expected to loose all their energy in the source .",
    "nevertheless , we compare the radiation cooling time to the particle escape time .",
    "the latter depends on the regime of diffusion inside the source . obviously , this diffusion rate is different from the galactic diffusion coefficient used to derive eq .",
    "( [ sdif ] ) and it can not be determined from first principles .",
    "however , the x - ray properties of supernovae remnants apparently indicate that inside these shock related non - thermal sources , the diffusion regime is similar to the bohm limit @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume this diffusion regime to be valid inside the source .",
    "thus , the source escape time can be estimated as t_bd=510 ^ 7e_tev^-1_1.5 ^ -4_-24 ^ 1/2s .",
    "[ eq : diff_source ] moreover , we note that the assumption of bohm diffusion inside the source is in fact closely related to the acceleration rate assumed above .    the radiative cooling time is determined by the density of the corresponding target . in the case of the synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) radiation mechanisms on the magnetic field @xmath100 and photon @xmath101 energy densities : t_ic=310 ^ 5 ( _ ph/1 evcm^-3)^-1 e_tev^-1 yr [ tic ] and the synchrotron cooling t_syn=410 ^ 5 ( b/5g)^-2 e_tev^-1 yr .",
    "[ tsyn ] equations  [ eq : forward_b ] and [ eq : b_j ] allow the synchrotron cooling time to be obtained , and the ic cooling time can be estimated based on the size of the termination shock .",
    "jet kinetic energy is largely transformed to the thermal energy at the termination shock .",
    "the photon energy density inside the source can be estimated as @xmath102 , which is comparable to the magnetic field energy density : @xmath103 .",

    "[ eq : nonthermal2 ] it can be seen that , for the case of the density of the medium expected in mcs , i.e. , @xmath106 , this estimate approaches unity .",
    "thus , while in the cases of _ local bubble _ and _ local interstellar cloud _ , jets emerging from ibhs are not expected to be plausible point sources , in the case of an ibh accreting in a mc , non - thermal particles can emit a significant part of their energy in the close vicinity of the source .",
    "one should expect similar fluxes emitted through the synchrotron and ic channels , since the energy densities of the target fields are similar .",

    "for the assumed condition at the reverse shock electron energy can significantly exceed 1  tev ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : emax ] ) , thus the synchrotron emission can cover quite a broad range from radio to soft gamma - rays .    the main target for the ic scattering is provided by the shocked mc material , which is expected to be heated to @xmath110 . in the thomson limit the energy of the up - scattered photon can be estimated as : _",
    "ic=20 e_tev^2 gev .",
    "[ eq : synch ]    the transition to the klein - nishina regime occurs for electrons of energy @xmath111  tev , i.e. in the band which is slightly above the range of optimal sensitivity of modern cherenkov detectors .",
    "thus , in what follows we do not discuss this energy range .",
    "it is also worthy to note that the spectral shape is expected to be flat with photon index @xmath96 , without any significant breaks .",
    "indeed , since the dominant cooling processes  synchrotron and ic  and escape time have the same energy dependence , the spectral breaks can be induced either by the transition to bremsstrahlung cooling dominance , or by the age of the source .",
    "the later is not relevant for sources with age @xmath112  yr , and the bremsstrahlung break should appear in the synchrotron spectrum at energy of @xmath113  ghz , i.e. in the range , which can hardly be probed with observations .",
    "however , if the diffusion deviates significantly from the bohm regime , this may lead to modification of the spectral shape , and a break in the electron spectrum should appear at energy corresponding to @xmath114 .",
    "also a weak klein - nishina hardening ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is expected to appear in the x - ray energy band @xmath115 .      since even in the case of ibhs located in mcs a significant fraction of the non - thermal power is able to escape from the source , below we study whether these sources can produce a detectable contribution to the diffuse background .",
    "however , the total power of these sources per kpc@xmath74 is @xmath116 ; this is approximately 2 orders of magnitude below the rate required to power the cr electron spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , these sources can give an important contribution only in the high energy part of the spectrum , where more distant sources are heavily suppressed due to particle energy losses .",
    "following previous studies @xcite we can say that the galactic background radiation field in the solar vicinity is determined by 3 main components : 1 ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( @xmath117 ) ; 2 ) far infra - red ( fir ) radiation of a dust ( @xmath118 ) and 3 ) visible light radiation from stars ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "we should point out that for optical radiation , lepton with @xmath120 interact in the klein - nishina regime , this significantly suppressing the interaction cross - section .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field near the sun is @xmath121 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the total energy density can be determined as @xmath122 .",
    "the cooling time scales ( eqs .",

    "this diffusion time is normalized to the distance to the closest young energetic pulsar ( the vela pulsar ) which is expected to be a powerful source of cr electrons @xcite .",
    "a comparison between @xmath125 and @xmath126 allows one to determine the energy range for which the nearby sources can give a more important contribution than pulsars .",

    "[ sdibh ] ) @xmath127 and we get an exponential cut - off near 50 tev . taking into account that the relation between pulsar and ibh power is @xmath128 , we can estimate the energy range where ibhs should dominate the spectra of cr electrons and positrons as @xmath129  tev . on the other hand ,",
    "these energies are close to the limiting value for ibhs . if however multi - tev cr electrons are detected ( e.g. , with cherenkov detectors , see @xcite ) , the ibh scenario could provide a feasible explanation .",
    "future experiments like cta can shed light on this problem .",
    "regarding a possible contribution to cr positrons , ibhs can supply particles in the high energy band ( gev and tev ) .",
    "however , their contribution is expected to be significantly exceeded by the contribution from the nearby pulsars , e.g. from the vela pulsar .",
    "in this paper we examine ibhs as possible jet sources . we find that the non - thermal efficiency of these sources depends strongly on the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "ibh jets launched in high density environments are characterized by a larger power and a stronger magnetic field .",
    "the latter feature appears to be very important since ( 1 ) it allows non - thermal particles to be accelerated up to vhe ; and ( 2 ) the ratio of the escape time to radiative cooling time decreases with increase of the magnetic field .",
    "the key source parameters ( jet luminosity , maximum energy of non - thermal particles and non - thermal luminosity ) scale with density as : @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the strong dependence of the non - thermal power , @xmath133 , on the medium density is related to the change of the ratio of radiative to escape losses and , in the case of high enough density , converges to the _ fast cooling regime _ , where @xmath134 .    more specifically , if the density of the surrounding medium is high , @xmath135 , the radiation cooling time is shorter than the escape time ( if the bohm diffusion regime is applies within the source ) .",
    "thus , the jet reverse shock can turn into an efficient emitter of non - thermal radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the density is lower , @xmath136 , the ibh should act as a source of electron cr , interestingly , for conventional values of the mc density ( @xmath137 ) , the non - thermal power of these sources should be shared in comparable fractions between the radiative cooling inside the source and escape .",
    "finally , for the ibhs accreting in low density environments @xmath138 , the accretion rate and maximum available energy of non - thermal particles appears to be too low to make any detectable contribution to the cr spectrum .",
    "moreover , as fast particles escape these sources , then they should not be considered as feasible point - like emitters .    as",
    "shown above , in the case of accretion in high density medium , the jets launched by ibhs , may emit a significant fraction of the accreted energy through synchrotron ( from radio to soft gamma - rays ) and ic channels ( up to very high energies ) within @xmath139 from the jet termination point .",
    "the luminosities radiated via these two mechanisms should be similar , since the energy densities of the target fields are expected to be comparable . the dominant target photon field for the ic is expected to be provided by shocked mc matter , which should be heated to @xmath140 .",
    "because of this relatively low temperature of the target field , the klein - nishina effect should not affect the shape of the ic spectrum in the range relevant for the modern gamma - ray instruments .",
    "however , the klein - nishina effect may lead to a weak hardening of the synchrotron x - ray component ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the spectra are expected to be featureless , with a photon index of @xmath96 over a broad energy range .",
    "any stronger spectral features in the spectrum would be attributed to a deviation of the escape rate from the bohm diffusion regime .",
    "it is also important to note that one can expect a certain variability of the non - thermal flux caused by the inhomogeneous structure of mcs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a typical velocity of @xmath141 , these inhomogeneities should lead to variability on a year time scale .    for the expected non - thermal luminosity of @xmath142",
    ", such sources should be detectable with modern x- and gamma - ray instruments up to a distance of @xmath143 . within this distance @xmath99 ibhs",
    "should be located in mcs .",
    "this may provide a feasible interpretation for some unidentified gamma - ray sources .",
    "regarding the impact of the non - thermal particles escaped from the shock region generated by ibhs in mcs , there are certain uncertainties related to the diffusion of these particles .",
    "namely , the propagation of such particles may proceed very differently within and outside the mc .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient in the mc is comparable to the galactic one , then the high energy particles should rapidly escape from the mc ( the mc crossing time is @xmath144 ) .",
    "however , several uncertainties do not allow us to claim ibhs to be the best candidates for production of very high cosmic ray electrons .",
    "the distribution of spins of ibhs is unknown and if @xmath145 jets will be weak or simply not launched at all @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked the contribution from the nearby pulsars up to the distance 300  pc using atnf ( the australia telescope national facility ) pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that the contribution in the cr electron spectrum from close pulsars is about a factor 10 smaller than expected contribution from ibhs .",
    "although we can miss some pulsars if their beamed radiation does not cross the earth , such pulsars can contribute to the population of electrons near the sun .",
    "so far it is unlikely that ibhs are the main source of electrons in cr , except hypothetical particles with @xmath146  tev .",
    "however , the physical scenario should be quite different if in mcs the diffusion operates slower .",
    "for example , for the bohm diffusion regime , the particles confinement in mc should be very long , @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the non - thermal particles injected by a ibh should produce a diffusive emission component associated with the host mc .",
    "the luminosity of this component should be comparable to the non - thermal power of the source , i.e. @xmath142 , so it might give a contribution comparable to the fluxes produced by cr interacting with the mc material @xcite .",
    "importantly , the spectra produce by cr protons interacting with the mc should be quite different from the ic spectra generated by the local population of cr electrons .",

    "<S> isolated black holes ( ibhs ) are not usually considered to be important astrophysical sources , since , even in the case of a high accretion rate , an accretion disk rarely can be formed due to the small angular momentum of the in - falling matter . thus , such systems are not expected to feature thermal disk emission which makes the dominant contribution to the radiative output of binary systems harbouring a bh . moreover , due to their relatively modest accretion rates , these objects are not conventionally treated as feasible jet sources . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large number of ibhs in the galaxy , estimated to be @xmath0 , implies a very high density of @xmath1 and an average distance between ibhs of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the magnetic flux , accumulated on the horizon of an ibh because of accretion of interstellar matter , allows the blandford - znajeck mechanism to be activated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , electron - positron jets can be launched . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed 2d numerical modelling which allowed the jet power to be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> their inferred properties make such jets a feasible electron accelerator which , in molecular clouds , allows electron energy to be boosted up to @xmath3  pev . for </S>",
    "<S> the conditions expected in molecular clouds the radiative cooling time should be comparable to the escape time . thus these sources can contribute both to the population of unidentified point - like sources and to the local cosmic ray ( cr ) electron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the generated electron crs depends on the diffusion rate inside molecular clouds ( mcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the diffusion regime in a mc is similar to galactic diffusion , the produced electrons should rapidly escape the cloud and contribute to the galactic cr population at very high energies @xmath4  tev . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the modest jet luminosity ( at the level of @xmath5 ) and low filling factor of mc , these sources can not make a significant contribution to the spectrum of cosmic ray electrons at lower energies . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the diffusion within mcs operates at a rate close to the bohm limit , the cr electrons escaping from the source should be confined in the cloud , significantly contributing to the local density of crs . </S>",
    "<S> the ic emission of these locally - generated crs may explain the variety of gamma ray spectra detected from nearby mcs .    </S>",
