    "is expected provided that the period of poling is sufficiently short so that a sufficienly large number of discontinuities is present inside the nonlinear crystal .",
    "the surface effects are also expected in wave - guiding geometries where the conditions of total reflection of fields at the boundaries are met .",
    "this might be important mainly in photonic fibers .",
    "the studied surface effects are by no means restricted to 1d geometries , even stronger surface contributions might arise from 2d or 3d nonlinear structures .",
    "an effective enhancement of the nonlinear interaction caused by the surface effects should also be observed in stimulated @xmath268 processes like second - harmonic generation .",
    "surface spontaneous parametric down - conversion has been predicted combining the solution of quantum heisenberg equations and the continuity requirements at boundaries .",
    "formulas for the determination of the number of generated photon pairs , spectra , and photon - fluxes of the down - converted fields as well as coincidence - count rates in a hong - ou - mandel interferometer have been derived using generalized signal- and idler - field two - photon spectral amplitudes .",

    "the surface contributions are important whenever strongly phase - mismatched nonlinear interactions give considerable contributions , e.g. , in nonlinear layered structures .",
    "an example of a gan / aln structure composed of several tens of layers has shown that the surface and volume contributions can be comparable in their amplitudes .",
