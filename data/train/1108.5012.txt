    "theoretically , one of the simplest and best motivated extensions of the standard model(sm ) is the introduction of an additional u@xmath1 gauge symmetry with the associated gauge boson @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such an u@xmath1 gauge symmetry often appears in grand unified theories , such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 theories .",
    "phenomenologically , as the extra u@xmath1 gauge symmetry can result in new interactions between the new gauge boson and the sm particles , it can lead to some interesting phenomena or explanations for possible experimental results away from the sm predictions @xcite .    in gauge theories ,",
    "the cancelation of anomaly is tightly connected with renormalizability . in the grand unified theories",
    "@xcite with a large group , such cancelation for u@xmath1 subgroup can be satisfied and new particles if any fill in , automatically . for phenomenological @xmath0 models , with",
    "an additional gauge group introduced , usually the anomaly is canceled with introducing by hand new chiral fermions . since no new fundamental fermion",
    "is observed yet , these new particles have to be heavy and usually difficult to be probed .    from an economical perspective , it is interesting to ask what an @xmath5 model looks like if introducing no new chiral fermion . for family universal @xmath5 models , unlike family non - universal ones discussed in @xcite ,",
    "there is no problem like flavor - changing neutral currents(fcnc ) effects .",
    "however , for such models , there is little room left if no new particles are added as we shall show later",
    ". then we shall not restrict the discussion within family non - universal models and but taking fcnc suppression as an requirement or constraint .",
    "in the present paper , based on the structure of non - linear equations from anomaly cancelation that constrain the @xmath5 charges of sm fermions , we shall show a simple uv complete and anomaly free @xmath0 model without introducing any exotic fermions beyond the sm . in this model ,",
    "the u@xmath1 charges of the first and second families are the same but different from the third family .",
    "a specific feature of this model is that the cancelation of anomalies is satisfied separately in lepton and quark sectors . in general , there can exist both flavor conserving and flavor changing interactions of @xmath0 gauge boson with quarks and leptons after spontaneous symmetry breaking and rotating to the mass eigenstates of quarks and leptons .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we give a brief summary for the anomaly - cancelation conditions of an extra u(1)@xmath2 gauge symmetry with the sm particles and the arguments that lead to our model . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide a detailed description on our @xmath0 model for the fermion and higgs sectors . in sec .",
    "iv , for flavor - conserving case we use the latest experiments direct search to constrain the parameters of the model and discuss for flavor - changing case an observable effect , forward - backward asymmetry of top pair production .",
    "our conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the requirement of vanishing of anomalies is usually used as a guide in building realistic renormalizable theories and many models are then accompanied with new chiral fermions to satisfy the requirement .",
    "these models may or may not have a unification origin , but in common they include many particles which is usually too heavy to be detected .",
    "for realistic reason , we shall restrict ourselves here to study an anomaly free u(1)@xmath2 model without introducing any new fermions , and we find a family non - universal model based on simple and reasonable assumptions .",
    "when introducing an additional u(1)@xmath6 gauge symmetry to the sm , we can assign the u(1)@xmath2 charges @xmath7 to all the sm particles as shown in table i. in the following discussions , like mentioned above , we shall not introduce any exotic fermions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we will leave @xmath8 as an arbitrary constant . when @xmath9 , it becomes a leptophobic model .",
    "and @xmath10 indicates that the u(1)@xmath2 charges of leptons and quarks are at the same order .",
    "an important feature in this model is that the u(1)@xmath2 charges of the third family are as twice large as those of the first and second families .",
    "this feature reduces the branching radio of @xmath11 in dilepton search , and then the constraints may also be relaxed correspondingly . in the later discussion of experiment constraint , we will consider the limits from both the dijet and dilepton search .",
    "based on the u@xmath1 charges of fermions , the sm higgs doublet @xmath12 with zero @xmath5 charge can cause the spontaneous symmetry breaking to generate the masses of all the sm particles .",
    "the yukawa interactions are @xmath13 the resulting two mass matrices have the following forms @xmath14 which shows that when the yukawa term eq.([eq : y_h1 ] ) is the only interaction , it can not obtain the realistic cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix for quark mixing and cp violation .",
    "thus we need to introduce two more higgs doublets with non - zero u@xmath1 charges . specifically taking @xmath15 with u(1)@xmath2 charge @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18",
    ", we have the additional yukawa interactions for @xmath15 and @xmath17 , @xmath19 these yukawa interactions will contribute to the mass matrices with@xmath20 similarly , one can write down the yukawa interactions in the lepton section . note that for @xmath21 , two extra higgs doublets have to be introduced .",
    "when @xmath22 and @xmath23 get vacuum expectation values(vevs ) , the u@xmath1 gauge symmetry will also be broken as they carry nonzero u(1)@xmath2 charges .",
    "if the u@xmath1 gauge coupling is at the same order as the electroweak coupling , the mass of @xmath0 boson is then at the same order as the electroweak scale , which is highly constrained . to get a heavy @xmath0 boson",
    ", we need to introduce a singlet scalar @xmath24 with u(1)@xmath2 charge . with three higgs doublets and their u(1)@xmath2 charges as well as a singlet scalar ( its u(1 ) charge",

    ", we may not discuss such terms in the rest of our paper .",

    "while such a symmetry can not be an exact , otherwise the form of yukawa terms will be highly constrained . in the spirit of simplicity for later phenomenological constraints , we will impose @xmath58 and then experimental constraints from @xmath63 mixing can be relaxed .",
    "we are now ready to consider in our model the phenomenological effects of @xmath0 boson and focus mostly on the quark sector to constrain the parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we shall show that the @xmath0 boson in this model , generally , allow both flavor conserving and flavor changing couplings at the mass eigenstates of quarks . in the flavor conserving processes , we use the latest dijet search result to constrain the production rate of @xmath0 and give some limits on @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "the branching ratio of @xmath122 , br@xmath123 is quadratically dependent on the @xmath8 with @xmath124 .",

    "limits from dilepton search are more stringent than those from dijet search as expected , since leptonic final states have better discriminating power .",
    "as mentioned above , this model also allows flavor - changing and left - right asymmetry couplings .",
    "in such a case , the limits from s - channel dijet or dilepton searches can not be literally applied .",

    "we have presented a simple uv complete and family non - universal u@xmath1 gauge model in which the anomaly is canceled by appropriately choosing the u(1)@xmath2 charges of the sm particles without introducing extra fermions . as the anomaly is canceled separately in the lepton and quark sectors , which may leave a room to escape the strong constraints from the direct searches for the final states with two leptons .",
