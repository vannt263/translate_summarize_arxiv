    "an important outcome of the ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the assertion that a novel phase of matter , the so called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is created for a short time in these reactions @xcite .",
    "such a state has been theoretically predicted in lattice gauge calculations ( lqcd ) which solve the equations of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) on a lattice under the condition that the system is in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "present and future @xcite experiments aim at a better understanding of the properties of the qgp ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this includes the determination of the yet unknown transport properties of qcd matter as well as the study of its phase structure at large net baryon densities .",
    "both can presently not be calculated in lqcd calculations .",
    "this involves the study of hadron multiplicities but also fluctuations of conserved quantities in a given rapidity interval which can be compared with lqcd results + the latter studies are faced with the problem that lqcd simulations are limited to systems in thermal equilibrium whereas in heavy ion reactions we are confronted with rapidly expanding systems which may or may not hadronize at ( or near ) the crossover line ( chemical freeze out ) and continue to expand until the interactions cease",
    ". this latter phase is called hadronic phase and is characterized by hadronic interactions which govern the time period when the system drops out of equilibrium .",
    "if one wants to compare the measured observables with the results of lqcd at an earlier times where the system may be in local equilibrium , one has to asses how the hadronic phase has modified the observables .",
    "as we will see , these modifications are not negligible . for the fluctuations of conserved charges we have shown this already in a previous publication @xcite .    to describe the expansion of the qgp and in particular the hadronic phase sophisticated model simulations are required .",
    "the current state - of - the - art of such models are so called hybrid models , where an initial state inferred from perturbative qcd calculations is used as input for a ( viscous ) fluid dynamical simulation @xcite . in the fluid dynamic approach the thermal properties of the matter under investigation , can be easily introduced , e.g. via the equation of state and the transport parameters .",
    "an important disadvantage of the fluid dynamical approach is that it is only valid for the description of systems at or very close to local thermal equilibrium . in general this condition",
    "seems to be fulfilled in the early phase of the system evolution , but eventually the densities of the rapidly expanding systems drop to a point where the mean free path becomes much larger than the system size .",
    "this usually occurs well after the expanding system has hadronized and can be described as a gas of interacting hadrons .",
    "the evolution of such a system can be described with the relativistic boltzman equation + @xmath2    here the change of the single particle distributions @xmath3 ( left hand side ) is caused by the collision term @xmath4 ( right hand side ) . using a transport model ( based on the boltzman equation ) as an afterburner which follows",
    "the fluid dynamical evolution has become the standard method of treating the interactions during the hadronic phase of nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "recently several studies have pointed out the importance of the hadronic rescattering , during the freeze - out phase of a nuclear reaction , on the description of observables like particle numbers and spectra , resonance production , momentum anisotropies and particle number fluctuations @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we will present a detailed analysis of the microscopic processes , occurring during the hadronic phase , as described by the microscopic transport model urqmd .",
    "the goal is to give a comprehensive summary of the hadronic interactions during the freeze - out and how and why they effect the final state observables .",
    "furthermore we will give specific examples of how the hadronic phase can be experimentally verified , e.g. through hadronic resonance measurements .",

    "to study the dynamics of the hadronic phase of a heavy ion collision we will use the urqmd hybrid model @xcite .",
    "this model combines a 3 + 1d ideal fluid dynamical simulation of the hot and dense phase of the collision ( qgp phase ) with a state - of - the - art transport description of the non - equilibrium hadronic decoupling phase . as the system at some point enters a dilute state , and is rapidly expanding , one expects that it quickly leaves a state of local thermal and chemical equilibrium . therefore the fluid dynamical description is not valid anymore and",
    "a non - equilibrium transport description for the hadronic phase is necessary . in the present investigation we use the cooper - frye equation , @xmath6 to transform the fluid dynamical fields to discrete hadrons on an iso - energy density hypersurface @xcite @xmath7  350 mev/@xmath8 . here",

    "the model includes nearly 60 different baryonic species with their anti - particles as well as about 40 mesonic states @xcite .",
    "the possible interactions between these hadrons include elastic scattering , resonance excitations , string excitations as well as strangeness exchange reactions .",
    "the cross sections are taken , when available , from the particle data group compilation @xcite .",
    "unknown cross sections are mainly estimated using the additive quark model or taken from model calculations . to present an example of the cross sections implemented in the urqmd model we show the total cross sections for several processes in fig .",
    "as one can see there are several processes with very large cross sections , mainly involving protons .",
    "in particular the proton+anti - proton annihilation cross section is large . to draw conclusions on the importance of these cross sections on final state observables",
    "one also requires knowledge on the phase space distributions and densities of the involved hadrons .",
    "the probabilities of certain reactions do not only depend on the magnitude of the cross section but also on the phase space densities of the involved hadrons .",
    "this makes the microscopic description of the hadronic phase so important .",
    "we start out by giving estimates on the expected number of hadronic processes during and the duration of the hadronic phase",
    ". we will investigate the dynamics of the hadronic interactions in the final phase of collisions of au+au at beam energies of @xmath15 gev , focusing on the mid rapidity region @xmath16 of most central ( @xmath17 fm ) collisions where experimental data are available .",
    "reaction rates of different hadronic interactions during the hadronic phase of central collisions of au+au at @xmath13 gev , as function of the total system evolution time .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the total number of hadronic scatterings , up to the time @xmath12 , defined as the time since the first initial collisions have taken place , is shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "here we compare different possible hadronic interactions , meson+meson resonance excitation and elastic scattering , meson+baryon resonance excitation and elastic scattering as well as baryon+antibaryon annihilation . for the collision energy under investigation the final rescattering is dominated by meson+meson interactions , due to the large number of mesons created at hadronization and only very few annihilation processes take place .",
    "however , since there are only few baryons created at hadronization the relative importance of these annihilations may still be significant , as we will see later .",
    "the number of scatterings changes most drastically in the time between hadronization , around 10 fm / c , and a time of roughly 20 fm / c , after which the number of hadronic scatterings does essentially not change anymore .",
    "this means that the hadronic rescattering mainly takes place in the 10 fm / c after hadronization . to interpret these collision numbers",
    "one should note that roughly 100 baryons and anti - baryons are produced in the mid - rapidity region of a heavy ion collision .",
    "thus the average number of resonance excitations per baryon is at least 2 , or , in other words , every proton or neutron finds itself , on average , twice in an excited state during the expansion .",
    "this result can also be seen in figure [ f2 ] which shows the normalized reaction rate for the different scattering processes displayed in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the scattering rate is normalized by the total number of scatterings to allow for a comparison of the shapes of the time dependence .",
    "we observe that the time evolution of the scattering rate for all processes is quite similar , or , in other words , the decrease of the density dominates over the size of the reaction cross section . at the end of the expansion the large @xmath18 baryon excitation cross section leads only to a slightly larger reaction rate for m+b inelastic collisions .",

    "resonances which decay early during the hadronic phase may not be identified experimentally because the decay products rescatter .",
    "therefore the number of identified resonances reflects the hadronic interaction during the hadronic phase .",
    "there are several hadronic resonances which can be and have been experimentally reconstructed and may carry information of the hadronic phase .",
    "the most promising states , which will be studied in this work , are summarized in table [ t1 ] .",
    "yields of different hadronic resonances as function of time and normalized to the initial yield at hadronization ( cooper - frye ) .",
    "one clearly sees the lifetime hierarchy .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .resonances and their decay channels [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t1 ]    it is obvious that the listed hadronic resonances have widely varying properties and in particular different lifetimes . for example , the @xmath19 meson has a more than 10 times larger lifetime than the @xmath20 meson which should be reflected in the dynamics of these resonances during the hadronic phase . to see that this is indeed true",
    "we show , in figure [ f3 ] , the net resonance gain rate as a function of time for the different hadronic resonances discussed . the net gain rate is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the resonance yield at hadronization ( cooper - frye ) , @xmath23 is the number of reactions that create a resonance and @xmath24 is the number of reactions that destroy a resonance , e.g. decay or inelastic scattering , per unit of time .",
    "the results presented in figure [ f3 ] clearly reflect the different lifetimes of the resonances , as the @xmath20 meson shows its largest loss rate during early times , while the @xmath19 decays only slowly and therefore shows a slow loss .",
    "however there is an interesting comparison between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "even though there is a lifetime difference of a factor 2 between these states , their net gain rate appears to be very similar .",
    "this hints to the fact that the @xmath26 has a quite substantial regeneration rate at early times of the hadronic phase .",
    "later we will see that this translates into specific different observable .",
    "fraction of observable resonances which have decayed until a time t. the results are for central collisions of au+au at @xmath13 gev . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the integrated yield of the resonances normalized to their value at chemical freeze out , is shown in figure [ f4 ] , as a function of the computational time .",
    "again we observe a clear hierarchy with respect to the lifetime of the resonance , with the exception of the @xmath26 , which undergoes significant regeneration in the time up to 20 fm / c .",
    "the lifetime hierarchy can also be observed in figure [ f18 ] where we show the fraction of observable / reconstructable resonances which have decayed until a time @xmath27 , as function of time .",
    "as expected , the @xmath19 meson decays at a very late time and the short lived resonances decay at an earlier time . as we have already discussed earlier the difference of the @xmath26 and @xmath25 is smaller than expected due to the significant @xmath26 regeneration at early times .",
    "an important observation is that even though short lives resonances like the @xmath20 or @xmath28 are the first to decay , most of the observable resonances still decay at times @xmath29 fm / c , i.e. a rather dilute hadronic system and hence may not carry much information on the dense system they where born in .    in order to use the resonances to understand the properties of the hadronic phase of a nuclear collision another aspect is crucial .",
    "not only do these resonances have different lifetimes , but they also decay into different daughter particles which have to be identified in order to reconstruct the original resonance . as these daughter particles may also undergo rescattering they may be lost to reconstruction , thus also the information on the mother resonance would be lost .",
    "the probability of the daughter particle rescattering does depend on the time of the resonance decay and on the rescattering cross section of the daughter particles which is different for example for pions and kaons . within our model simulation",
    "we can investigate the rescattering of these daughter particles and define a detection probability , which gives the probability that the daughter particles of a given resonance did not rescatter subsequently in the hadronic medium .",
    "this detection probability is shown as function of the total evolution time , in the center of mass frame of the collision , in figure [ f5 ] . all",
    "considered resonances show a similar dependence on time of their detection probability .",
    "this is expected , as the rescattering of the daughter particles depends to first order on the density of possible scattering partners which strongly decreases with time .",
    "furthermore the detection probability of the @xmath19 is slightly larger than that of the @xmath20 as the kaons from the @xmath19 have a smaller rescattering cross section than the pions from the @xmath20 decay .",
    "as we have seen before , not all resonances decay at the same time and therefore the time integrated detection probability for the different resonances will depend also on their lifetime . in figure [ f17 ] we therefore show the time integrated detection probability as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath30 of the resonance .",
    "we observe two distinct features .",
    "first of all we see that there is a clear hierarchy of the detection probability of the resonances where the @xmath19 with its long lifetime and small hadronic cross section has the highest and the @xmath20 has the lowest probability of being detectable .",
    "furthermore we also observe a strong dependence of the detection probability on the transverse momentum of the resonance .",
    "this can be understood because fast resonances leave the system more rapidly than slow ones and have therefore a lower chance that their decay products rescatter .",
    "detection probability of different hadronic resonances as function of the time of their decay .",

    "the results are for central collisions of au+au at @xmath13 gev .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    will the final state interactions lead to observable differences in resonance multiplicities and properties ?",
    "to answer this question we calculate the ratio of the @xmath30 integrated multiplicity of detectable resonances and the corresponding multiplicity of their ground state hadron .",
    "we can do this at two times : either at the end of the hadronic phase by including all hadronic interactions or at the chemical freeze out by extracting this ratio after the hadron production on the cooper - frye hypersurface .",
    "the resulting ratios for central collisions of au+au at a beam energy of @xmath31 gev , are depicted in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "here we also compare the results with experimental data from the star experiment @xcite . we observe a very good agreement of our results with the experimental data in the case of the full model .",
    "when the final hadronic rescattering is neglected there is a deviation from the experimental results , especially for the @xmath32 and @xmath25 ratios , indicating that they are most sensitive to the rescattering phase .    to confirm further the importance of hadronic rescatter",
    ", we show the centrality dependence of the aforementioned ratios in figure [ f7 ] . here",
    "we see again that the @xmath32 and @xmath25 ratios decrease significantly from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "as expected , in the larger systems created in central collisions , the decay products have a larger probability to rescatter .",
    "thus the resonance is effectively lost from reconstruction and the ratio is decreased .",
    "an interesting result of the hadronic rescattering is that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 ratio actually increase slightly for central collisions while the other ratios decrease . for the @xmath19",
    "this is a result of the long lifetime and small hadronic cross section as well as a small regeneration of @xmath19 mesons . for the @xmath26",
    "this behavior is a result of its smaller mass , as compared to the @xmath25 and therefore of a higher regeneration rate at later times .",

    "the observations on hadronic resonance yields strongly indicate the existence of a hadronic rescattering phase which has measurable impact on hadron properties . in the following we want to discuss whether we can also expect an impact of this rescattering phase on stable hadron yields and properties like spectra and collective flow . here",
    "we can distinguish two types of hadronic scatterings .",
    "one is the ( pseudo-)elastic scattering which changes only the momentum distribution of the present hadrons but not their abundances .",
    "furthermore there may be inelastic scatterings which may change the flavor and hadronic abundances during the hadronic rescattering .",
    "the most relevant processes here are annihilation of baryons and anti - baryons , strangeness exchange reactions and multi - body decays of resonances essentially increasing the number of pions . in figure [ f8 ]",
    "we show the time dependence of stable hadron yields ( including contributions from resonance decays ) as a function of time , for most central collisions of au+au at a beam energy of @xmath35 gev . here",
    "the multiplicities are scaled to the final ( observable ) value to quantify the effect of the hadronic rescattering .",
    "we observe a very clear time dependence , confirming that the hadronic rescattering changes the chemical composition of the stable hadrons to times as large as 20 @xmath36 .",
    "we also observe characteristic differences for the different hadron species .",
    "for example the protons show the largest decrease in yield due to annihilation . the proton annihilation is stronger than that of @xmath37 hyperons due to the larger annihilation cross section .",

    "we compare three distinct hadrons , pions , protons and @xmath39 .",
    "each species shows a very different characteristic change of the spectrum .",
    "the proton spectrum is mainly enhanced at large momenta and is depleted at low momenta , which reflects the generation of transverse collective velocity flow which has been observed in these reactions .",
    "this change is mainly caused by elastic and pseudo - elastic scatterings , while baryon antibaryon annihilation decreases the spectrum mostly independent of @xmath38 .",
    "the pions also obtain an additional radial flow , however also the low @xmath38 part of the pion spectrum is enhanced .",
    "this is due to contributions from resonance decays which populate mainly the low transverse momenta .",
    "the @xmath39 baryon receives the smallest change in the spectrum due to its small hadronic rescattering cross section .",
    "it is little affected from the transverse flow . that the average value of the ratio is below one is likely a consequence of the strangeness exchange reaction and longitudinal expansion .",
    "an important and much discussed contribution to the final state hadronic rescattering is the baryon+anti - baryon annihilation reaction . in this reaction",
    "the baryons , e.g. proton and anti - proton , annihilate to form multiple mesons . for the case of nucleons and anti",

    "do not include multi particle scatterings , the inverse reaction , 5 pions creating a baryon + anti - baryon pair , is not taken into account @xcite .",
    "this violates detailed balance but in an expanding system which hadronizes at an energy density of @xmath40 this reaction , which decreases with @xmath41 , is rare @xcite .",
    "this has also been shown in studies where the detailed balance for this reaction has been explicitly included and the resulting baryon and anti - baryon loss in the hadronic phase is comparable to our scenario @xcite . nevertheless it is worthwhile to further pursue the implementation of a hadronic rescattering phase that includes such multi - particle scattering in order to minimize the systematic errors on the model side .",

    "we can clearly see that the loss rate has a maximum for a transverse momentum of roughly 600 - 700 mev .",

    "one can clearly see that less than half of all annihilated baryons are actually in their ground state .",
    "this also means that in less than 25@xmath1 of all annihilation reactions two ground state baryons annihilate .",
    "the majority of these reactions will have a larger invariant mass and therefore produce on average more than 5 pions and eventually even heavier mesons like kaons .",

    "<S> the hadronic phase in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions has a large influence on final state observables like multiplicity , flow and @xmath0 spectra , as studied in the urqmd approach . in this model </S>",
    "<S> one assumes that a non - equilibrium decoupling phase follows a fluid dynamical description of the high density phase . </S>",
    "<S> hadrons are produced assuming local thermal equilibrium and dynamically decouple during the hadronic rescattering until the particles are registered in the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> this rescattering of hadrons modifies every hadronic bulk observable . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent multiplicity of resonances is suppressed as compared to a chemical equilibrium freeze - out model , because the decay products rescatter . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the resonances , which decay in the early hadronic phase , can not be identified anymore by the invariant mass method . </S>",
    "<S> stable and unstable particles change their momentum distribution by more than 30@xmath1 through rescattering and their multiplicity is modified by resonance production and annihilation on a similar magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> these findings show that it is all but trivial to conclude from the final state observables on the properties of the system at an earlier time where it may have been in local equilibrium . </S>"
