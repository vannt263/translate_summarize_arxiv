    "statistical analysis of time series is an important issue in many areas of science . many existing time series models postulate gaussian innovations .",
    "statistical inference is then typically based on the idea of maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "some well - known examples include the autoregressive moving average ( arma ) models @xcite and the generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic ( garch ) models @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that time series with non - gaussian innovations frequently occur in health , social and environmental sciences @xcite .",
    "often , the gaussian quasi - maximum likelihood estimator ( gqmle ) is used to alleviate this issue , and in most circumstances , the resulting estimates are still consistent ( cf .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that there are circumstances where semiparametric models are preferable , because estimating the distribution function of the innovations enhances our understanding of the data .",
    "for example , utilizing its quantiles can lead to more informative predictions @xcite .    as an early attempt to model the innovation density nonparametrically , @xcite proposed a semiparametric autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic ( arch ) model based on a nonparametric density estimation technique called discrete maximum penalized likelihood estimation .",
    "@xcite suggested an adaptive estimator ( ae ) for arma based on the kernel density estimator .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for related work on other time series models .",
    "however , we argue that the above - mentioned estimators may potentially suffer from the following drawbacks :    a.   they mainly focus on estimating the parametric part of the models ; b.   their finite - sample performances depend heavily on the choice of tuning parameters , especially when the sample size is not too large . however , none of the above - cited work gives practical guidelines on how to set tuning parameters ; c.   often some restrictive conditions are imposed , for instance , it is generally assumed that the innovation distribution has a continuous density function .",
    "furthermore , both @xcite and @xcite require the density function of the innovations to be symmetric .",
    "motivated by recent developments in shape - constrained density estimation , in this paper we take a different approach by assuming that the innovations have a _ log - concave _ density ( i.e. the logarithm of the density function is concave ) .",
    "the class of log - concave densities contains many commonly encountered parametric families of univariate distributions , including normal , gamma with shape parameter at least 1 , weibull distributions with shape parameter at least 1 , beta(@xmath0 ) with @xmath1 , logistic , laplace ( double exponential ) and gumbel ; see @xcite for more examples . throughout this paper",
    ", we denote the class of log - concave densities by @xmath2 .",
    "our new modeling framework is as follows .",
    "denote a class of separated semiparametric time series models by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the density function of the independent and identically distributed ( _ i.i.d .",
    "_ ) innovations , and @xmath5 is the parameter vector taking values in a parameter space @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be its log - likelihood function .",
    "denote the true density of the innovations and the true value of parameter vector by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "we propose to estimate @xmath8 and @xmath9 by @xmath10 we call @xmath11 the _ log - concave maximum likelihood estimator _",
    "( lcmle ) .",
    "our method can be viewed as a generalization of @xcite , where this type of estimators was first proposed and studied for the linear regression models .",
    "it is also related to sieved estimators such as those in @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of our method include the following :    a.   it is _ free _ of tuning parameters ; b.   it simultaneously estimates the density function of the innovations and the parametric part of the model ; c.   it is straightforward to implement ; d.   it is easy to adapt to a wide class of time series models with only minor modifications ; e.   for many classes of models , if @xmath8 is log - concave , then both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are consistent ; f.   even if @xmath8 is not log - concave , under weak assumptions ( mainly the finite first moment of @xmath8 ) , @xmath13 can still be a consistent estimator of @xmath9 ; g.   it offers huge potential improvement over both the gqmle and the ae in terms of finite sample performance .",
    "here we list some applicable areas for our procedure .",
    "we argue that our approach gives an alternative to many of the statistical models listed below .",
    "a.   : investigations @xcite show that the independent residuals of autoregressive daily flow models have distributions whose tails are not heavier than exponential .",
    "@xcite studied the arma models with laplace innovations and used it to model the sulphate concentration in lakes in ontario , canada .",
    "b.   : @xcite studied the arma models with skewed innovations , and fitted an autoregressive model with gamma innovations to the canadian lynx data .",
    "see section  [ sec : rabbit ] for an empirical example .",
    "c.   : the garch model with laplace innovations",
    "was shown to be superior to that with gaussian innovations by @xcite for the s&p 500 index .",
    "in addition , @xcite reported that the garch model with innovations being the convolution of laplace and gaussian ( which is log - concave ) offers a plausible description of the daily stock return series in germany .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the arma - garch models with asymmetric laplace innovations and applied them to model real estate returns .",
    "see also section  [ sec : ftse ] for a real data example .",
    "the nonparametric log - concave maximum likelihood density estimator was studied in the _ i.i.d . _ setting by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these references contain characterizations of the estimator , asymptotics and algorithms for its computation .",
    "regarding its applications , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where it has been applied to the isotonic / linear regression , the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve estimation and independent component analysis . yet , to the best of our knowledge , none of the existing work concerns dependent data structures such as the stochastic processes studied in this paper .",
    "in fact , this paper gives very positive answers to the questions raised recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for other popular shape constraints , one may refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : linear ] , we apply our method to the class of arma models .",
    "we display in detail how the lcmle is constructed in section  [ sec : linearconstruct ] .",
    "theoretical results regarding its existence and consistency are given in section  [ sec : lineartheory ] .",
    "a variant of the lcmle is suggested in section  [ sec : linearsmooth ] , which offers further potential improvement in small sample sizes and provides a nice link to the smoothed log - concave maximum likelihood estimator studied by @xcite and @xcite .    section  [ sec : nonlinear ] adapts the framework to a particular nonlinear setting , where arma - garch models are considered .",
    "the challenge of constructing the lcmle is taken up in section [ sec : nonlinearconstruct ] , while results concerning its existence and consistency are described in section [ sec : nonlineartheory ] .",
    "it is worth noting that in sections  [ sec : lineartheory ] and [ sec : nonlineartheory ] , our theory is developed under both correct and incorrect model specification of the innovation distribution .",
    "section  [ sec : computing ] is devoted to the computation of the lcmle .",
    "simulation studies follow in section  [ sec : simgq ] and [ sec : simae ] , confirming the significantly improved finite sample performance over the gqmle and the ae in the setting of non - gaussian innovations .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that even in the case where the innovations are gaussian , the performance of our lcmle remains comparable to that of its competitors .",
    "these simulation results show great promise of the lcmle , even though its asymptotic distributional theory remains to be investigated further .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : realdata ] gives applications of our methodology to model the daily log - return of ftse 100 index and the yorkshire rabbit ( _ oryctolagus cuniculus _ ) population .",
    "we defer all proofs to the appendix .",
    "in this section , we consider the arma(@xmath14 ) process with observations @xmath15 . the model is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are _ i.i.d .",
    "_ random variables , and where @xmath18 are real coefficients",
    ".    arguably , arma models are the most popular linear models used by time series practitioners .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough survey of the background .",
    "our goal in this section is to estimate the parameters @xmath19 and the distribution of @xmath17 simultaneously .",
    "assume that the observations @xmath20 are from an arma(@xmath14 ) process , where the orders @xmath21 and @xmath22 are known .",
    "the vector of the parameters @xmath23 belongs to a parameter space @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote respectively the true value of the parameter vector and the true distribution of the innovations .",

    "furthermore , denote the set of concave log - densities by @xmath31    the following conditions are imposed to construct the lcmle :    1 .",

    "@xmath32 , where @xmath6 is closed ; 3 .",
    "@xmath6 is a bounded subset of @xmath33 .",

    "these initial values are taken to be fixed ( i.e. neither random nor functions of the parameters ) .",
    "intuitively , one would seek to maximize @xmath40 over @xmath41 .",
    "however , it turns out that this naive optimization approach is very computationally intensive .",
