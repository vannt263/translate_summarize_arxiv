    "radiation plays important roles in many astronomical objects and media .",
    "thus we need to include the effects of radiation somehow in a realistic numerical simulation .",
    "however it is still an extremely heavy load to solve the full radiative transfer , i.e. , taking account of energy spectrum and angular distribution as well as spatial distribution and temporal evolution .",
    "this is simply because the radiative intensity is a function in 6 dimensional phase space .",
    "we need to reduce the load by using some approximations .",
    "there exists several types of ideas for reducing the computation cost .",
    "each of them have advantages and weak points .",
    "first we can use a symmetry to reduce the cost for computation .",
    "if the spherical symmetry is a good approximation , the intensity is a function in three dimensional phase space and the radiative transfer is relatively easy to solve .",
    "however this idea can be applied only to highly symmetric systems .",
    "second we can assume that only a few sources are dominant in the radiation fields . if most of light comes from restricted relatively small number of sources , solving radiative transfer is relatively easy .",
    "we need to solve only the light rays from the sources .",
    "the number of light rays to be solved are greatly reduced .",
    "it is a good approximation when some stars or black holes are dominant light sources ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "however reflection and reemission from diffuse media can not be taken into account under this approximation .",
    "third we can use the moments of radiative intensity such as the energy density by using some approximation on the angular distribution such as the flux limited diffusion ( fld , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fld uses only the radiative energy density , which is equivalent to the average radiative intensity over the solid angle of photon traveling , to express the radiation field .",
    "the radiative flux is derived from the gradient of the energy density .",
    "this approximation is good when the medium is optically thick and radiation field is nearly isotropic .",
    "it is not so bad even when the medium is transparent .",
    "however , this approximation can not express a shadow , a dark region behind an opaque object of finite extent .",
    "spurious radiation erases out the shadow in fld @xcite .",
    "scattering is another weak point of fld . scattering changes angular distribution of intensity but not the energy density .",
    "thus fld can not evaluate the effects of scattering since fld takes account of only energy density .",
    "@xcite proposed m1 model in which the radiation field is expressed by the energy density and flux , i.e. , both the 0th and 1st moments of the radiative intensity .",
    "it is demonstrated that m1 scheme can simulate a shadow by an opaque sphere successfully .",
    "m1 scheme can take account of scattering .",
    "scattering reduces the energy flux while keeping the radiation density constant .",
    "when the scattering is isotropic , the effect is correctly taken into account in m1 model .",
    "however , also m1 model has several weak points and limitations .",
    "m1 model can not solve crossing of two beamed lights .",
    "they erroneously merge into a beam at the crossing point .",
    "this limitation comes from the fact that m1 model evaluates higher moments of radiation intensity from the 0th and 1st moments . in other words ,",
    "m1 model has the lowest angular resolution and crossing of two beams are beyond the scope .",
    "this limitation is compensated by the low computation cost .",
    "m1 model equations are similar to the hydrodynamical equations in the conservation form .",
    "both the equations are hyperbolic and have source terms .",
    "thus we can apply numerical methods for integration of the hydrodynamical equations to solve m1 model equations .",
    "however we have two concerns when solving m1 model equations .",
    "first the characteristic speeds are complex and not easy to evaluate , though modern schemes for numerical hydrodynamics rely on them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we can avoid the computation of characteristics by using hlle flux but the resultant flux is diffusive and makes a shadow dim as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "second , absorption and emission ( the source terms ) are dominant when optically thick . on the other hand ,",
    "the source terms due to gravity are minor contributions in numerical hydrodynamics .",
    "thus they are simply added after solving wave propagation .",
    "this approach does not work well in m1 model equations when a cell itself is optically thick .",
    "this difficulty is known as the diffusion limit behavior and several solutions are proposed in the literature ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we propose an idea to construct a numerical flux for m1 model which is less diffusive and yet stable in the diffusion limit .",
    "first we show a method to evaluate a numerical flux of m1 model from radiation intensity kinetically reconstructed from the radiation energy density and flux .",
    "the reconstructed radiation intensity is consistent with the closure relation , i.e. , the formula to close the moment equations of the radiative transfer .",
    "we evaluate the radiative flux and pressure across the boundary between two adjacent computation cells by integrating the reconstructed intensity over the solid angle .",
    "we use the intensity of the upwind side , the numerical flux is subject to causality .",
    "fortunately , the numerical flux is an explicit function of the radiation energy density and flux .",
    "a similar scheme is constructed for gas dynamics and called kinetic scheme  ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references cieted in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we use the same terminology in this paper .",
    "second we include absorption within a computation cell .",
    "the numerical flux is evaluated on the cell surface , while the energy density and flux are evaluated at the cell center .",
    "they can be appreciably different if the cell itself is optically thick .",
    "we propose an interpolation formula which provides a good approximation both in the optically thin and thick limits .",
    "it approaches to one obtained from the reconstructed intensity in the optically thin limit , while it does to the diffusion approximation in the optically thick limit .",
    "we show that this numerical flux gives a stable solution even when the computation box contains both optically thin and thick cells .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our numerical methods to solve the m1 model in  2 .",
    "we perform some simple examples to show the nature of our numerical scheme in  3 . in  4 ,",
    "we apply m1 model to irradiated protoplanetary disks . we discuss accuracy and stability of our numerical flux in  5 .",
    "we also discuss affinity of m1 model for massively parallel computing in  5 .",
    "methods for constructing numerical flux of the second order accuracy in space are given in appendix .",
    "first we review m1 model of @xcite .",
    "we assume that emission is thermal and scattering is isotropic .",
    "then the radiative transfer equation for the specific intensity , @xmath6 , is expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath5 denote the density the speed of light , respectively ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the absorption and scattering opacities at the photon frequency , @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the symbols , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , denote the angular variable , i.e. , the unit vector parallel to the light propagation .",
    "the symbol , @xmath14 , denotes the planck function and is a function of the temperature , @xmath15 .",
    "we integrate equation ( [ transfer0 ] ) over the solid angle to obtain @xmath16 where @xmath17 the symbol , @xmath18 , specifies a direction in the cartesian coordinates and @xmath19 does the unit vector in the direction . equation ( [ moment0 ] ) denotes the conservation of radiation energy density , @xmath20 , when the right hand side vanishes . for simplicity we assumed that the emission and absorption are isotropic .",
    "similary we obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 by integrating equation  ( [ transfer0 ] ) multiplied by @xmath12 over the whole solid angle .",
    "the symbol , @xmath23 , as well as @xmath18 specifies one in the cartesian coordinates .",
    "when deriving equation ( [ moment1 ] ) , we assumed that the scattering is symmetric with respect to forward and backward .",
    "when the scattering is anisotropic , equation ( [ moment1 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath24 \\ , \\rho \\ ,",
    "f _ { \\nu , i } \\ ,   , \\label{moment1a}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the scattering asymmetry parameter .    in order to solve equations ( [ moment0 ] ) and ( [ moment1 ] )",
    ", we invoke the closure relation , @xmath26 \\ , e _",
    "\\nu , \\label{closure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27    the above radiative transfer equation is solved in coupled with the hydrodynamical equations .",
    "the solution of the hydrodynamical equations provides the density , velocity , and temperature .",
    "hence the opacity and source functions are evaluated as the functions of them . in this paper",
    "we consider only the change in the temperature and neglect the changes in the density and velocity .",
    "this approximation can be justified when we consider the protoplanetary disk in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the frequency dependent opacity depends little on the density and temperature in a certain regime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although the rosseland mean opacity does depend .",
    "the gas is heated by absorption and cooled by emission .",
    "the heating and cooling are evaluated by @xmath28 \\ , d\\nu \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the lagrange derivative and the specific entropy , respectively .",

    "the gas is assumed to be ideal one of which the specific heat ratio is @xmath38 .",
    "equations ( [ moment0 ] ) and ( [ moment1 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath39 @xmath40 \\ , .",
    "\\label{conservation - form}\\ ] ] equation ( [ conservation - form ] ) has the same structure as that of the hydrodynamical equations in the conservation form .",
    "thus the godunov - type method , which is often used for solving the hydrodynamical equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , can be applied to equation ( [ conservation - form ] ) .    in the godunov - type method ,",
    "the time evolution is evaluated based on the characteristics , i.e. , the propagation speeds of signal .",
    "the characteristics of equation ( [ conservation - form ] ) is rather complex and the computation of them takes much time .",
    "@xcite obtained them by interpolating the table prepared rather than by computing them at each time step .",
    "we can avoid detailed computation of the characteristics by employing hlle scheme , in which we need only the upper and lower limits on the characteristics ( cf .",
    "however , hlle scheme gives us a too much diffusive solution if the upper and lower limits are taken to be the speed of light , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "ideal characteristics should be evaluated from the radiation fields in the adjacent cells across the surface on which the numerical flux is evaluated .",
    "figure  1 of @xcite shows the characteristics for a given radiation field .",
    "the ideal characteristics should be appropriately averaged ones when the radiation fields differ appreciably in the two adjacent cells .",
    "@xcite obtained such average characteristics for the hydrodynamical equations .",
    "similar average characteristics have not been obtained for the moment equation of the radiative transfer .",
    "we obtain the numerical flux not by computing the characteristics but by reconstructing the intensity consistent with the moments of the radiation field . when the intensity is expressed as @xmath42 @xmath43 the moments as well as the closure relation , equation ( [ closure ] ) , are consistent with the assumed radiation field .",
    "although the closure relation can not specify the intensity uniquely , equation ( [ intensity ] ) has a distinctive feature : the entropy is minimum @xcite .",
    "we can obtain the angular distribution by the lorentz transform of an isotropic radiation field @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the flux , @xmath44 , across a cell boundary between two adjacent cells by using the reconstructed intensity .",
    "we call the two cells , left ( l ) and right ( r ) , for later convenience .",
    "the cell surface is assumed to be normal to the @xmath18-th direction , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "then the intensity on the cell surface is evaluated to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the radiation field reconstructed in l and r cells , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ upwind ] ) is based on the fact that photons transmit the surface from l to r when @xmath49 and from r to l otherwise . in other words , the intensity on the upwind side is identified as that on the surface .",
    "thus the energy flux , @xmath50 is expected to inherit the upwindnature and accordingly to be an alternative to the godunov - type numerical flux .",
