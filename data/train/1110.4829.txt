    "+ diffractive parton distributions functions ( dpdf ) are essential ingredients in the understanding and description of hard diffractive processes .",
    "the factorization theorem for diffractive process in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite enables one to factorize the diffractive dis cross - sections into the long - distance contribution parametrised by dpdf s , from the short - distance , pertubatively calculable , one .",
    "although dpdf s encode non - perturbative effects of qcd dynamics , their variation with respect to the factorization scale is predicted by pqcd  @xcite .",
    "moreover the short distance cross - sections is the same as inclusive dis  @xcite so that higher order corrections can be systematically evaluated . due to the factorization theorem , dpdf s",
    "are predicted to be universal distributions in the context of diffractive dis .",
    "next - to - leading order predictions based on dpdf s have been found to well describe dis diffractive dijet cross - sections  @xcite , thus confirming factorization . on the contrary ,",
    "the issue of factorization is still debated in diffractive photoproduction of dijets since the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite collaborations do report conflicting results .",
    "dpdf s give the joint probability for a parton in a proton of four - momentum @xmath0 to initiate a hard scattering keeping the proton intact with a four - momentum @xmath1 in the final state .",
    "diffractive parton distributions are a special case of extended fracture functions @xcite in the kinematic range @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fractional energy loss of the final state proton and @xmath5 the invariant momentum transfer , @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of large and positive scale violations up to the largest parton fractional momentum , @xmath7 , accessible to experiments reveals that dpdf s are gluon dominated distributions .",
    "diffractive gluon distributions are however hardly determined by the diffractive structure functions alone and this fact has stimulated experimental collaborations to measure quantity that are directly sensitive to it  @xcite and to include such data in global fits .",
    "the general method used to extract dpdf s from available data heavily relies on a number of assumptions motivated by regge phenomenology .",
    "the purpose of this short note is to present a new method which does not require any regge assumptions and is much closer in spirit to the factorization theorem .",
    "+ for this analysis we will use h1  @xcite data in which dis diffractive events , @xmath8 , are selected by requiring a large rapidity gap between the hadronic system x and the low mass dissociative system y ( which may consist in the scattered @xmath9 only ) . the kinematics of diffractive events is specified by the following variables : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the photon virtuality , @xmath12 is the invariant mass of the hadronic final state @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the usual @xmath15-bjorken dis variable and @xmath16 is the hera center of mass energy . the measurament is integrated over the hadronic final state @xmath17 mass region @xmath18 and the invariant momentum transfer @xmath19 , which then define the extracted dpdf s  @xcite .",
    "the kinematical coverage is wide ranging from @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we notice however that the @xmath23 coverage changes with @xmath4 due to kinematic constraints and this fact will reflect on dpdf s extraction .",
    "data are presented as a three - fold reduced @xmath24 cross section which depends on the diffractive structure functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the one - photon exchange approximation",
    ", it reads : @xmath27",
    "+ the widely used approach  @xcite to extract dpdf s is to assume proton vertex factorization , _",
    "i.e. _ that dpdf s can be factorized into a flux factor depending only on @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a term depending only on @xmath7 and @xmath11 : @xmath28 each term in the expansion , according to regge theory , is supposed to give a dominant contribution in a given range of @xmath4 , the pomeron ( @xmath29 ) at low @xmath4 and the reggeon ( @xmath30 ) at higher value of @xmath4",
    ". the flux factor @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) can be interpreted as the probability that a pomeron ( reggeon ) with a given value of @xmath4 and @xmath5 couples to the proton .",
    "the fluxes @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependences used in the fits are motivated by regge theory .",
    "this approach requires that parton distributions of the pomeron , @xmath33 , and of the reggeon , @xmath34 , must be simultaneously extracted from data .",
    "this procedure introduces a large number of parameters in the fit and it is potentially biased by the choices of the flux factors .",
    "a common choice used in phenomenological application is to fix @xmath34 to be equal to pion parton distribution functions .",
    "although such an approach has been proven to be supported by phenomenological analyses within the precision obtained with hera - i data , it is not routed in perturbative qcd and may show up to be not satisfactory with the expected precision increase of hera - ii data and h1+zeus complete combination .",
    "the alternative method we propose is instead inspired by the factorization theorem @xcite for diffractive dis itself .",
    "the latter states that factorization holds at fixed values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 so that the parton content described by @xmath35 is uniquely fixed by the kinematics of the outgoing proton and it is in principle different for different values of @xmath4 . in practice",
    "this idea is realized performing a series of separate pqcd fits at fixed values of @xmath4 with a common initial condition controlled by a set of parameters @xmath36 .",
    "this procedure guide us to infere the approximate dependence of parameters @xmath36 on @xmath4 allowing the construction of initial condition in the @xmath37 space to be used in a global fit , without any further model dependent assumption .",
    "+ in each @xmath4-bin for which data are presented by the experimental collaboration we perform a separate pqcd fits . for the singlet and gluon distributions at the arbitrary scale @xmath38",
    "we choose : @xmath39 so that there are four free parameters .",
    "we make the common assumption that all lights quark distributions are equal to each other and the exponential dumping exponential factor allows more freedom in the variation of the parameters @xmath40 at large @xmath7 . the functional form in eq .",
    "( [ ic ] ) is identical to the one used by h1 collaboration in ref .",
    "since diffractive dis data hardly discriminate  @xcite between different behaviour of gluon distributions at large @xmath7 we choose the simpler one in which the gluon is a costant at @xmath38 .",
    "such distributions are then evolved with the ` qcdnum17 `  @xcite program within a fixed flavour number scheme to next - to - leading order accuracy .",
    "heavy flavours contributions are taken into account in the general massive scheme .",
    "the convolution engine of ` qcdnum17 ` is used to obtain @xmath25 and @xmath26 structure functions at next - to - leading order which are then minimized versus data . in order to avoid the resonance region , a cut on the invariant mass of the hadronic system @xmath13",
    "is applied , @xmath41 .",
    "single @xmath4-fit results are sensitive to the choice of the mininum value @xmath11 of data to be included in the fits .",

    "the initial condition , eq .",
    "( [ ic2 ] ) , allows the singlet and gluon normalization , @xmath45 and @xmath54 respectively , to have a different power behaviour .",
    "it is therefore interesting to notice that if the condition @xmath55 is imposed , this result in a global @xmath56 for 183 degree of freedom .",

    "this is an _ a posteriori _ confirmation that not only diffractive parton distributions change their magnitude versus @xmath4 but also that a modulation in their @xmath7-shape ( for the singlet , in this case ) is necessary to better fit the data .",
    "+ we have outlined a new method to extract diffractive parton distributions inspired by the factorization theorem for diffractive dis . from a series of pqcd fits at fixed @xmath4 we infere the dependence of parameters on such a variable and this allows us to construct a generalized initial condition without assuming neither proton vertex factorization nor the existence of a series of regge trajectories .",
    "although the quality of the resulting fit gives a @xmath43 / d.o.f close to unity , as the regge based pqcd fit  @xcite , the new procedure treats the non - perturbative @xmath4-dependence of the cross - sections in a controlled and less model dependent way .",
    "this feature will allow further factorization test to be performed with the improved precision of published  @xcite and forthcoming data  @xcite .",
