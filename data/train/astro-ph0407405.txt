    "accretion onto black holes is observed over a wide range of luminosities .",
    "while the upper end of the luminosity range , including bright x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei , is relatively accessible , quiescent or near - quiescent accretion is more difficult to study .",
    "there remain large uncertainties about the structure of the accretion flow in quiescence ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and it is possible that the energy output could be dominated by a jet rather than by the accretion flow itself @xcite .",
    "these accreting black holes emit across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to x - rays , so multiwavelength studies can be used to disentangle different sources from different regions of the inflow , outflow , or jet , and to establish causal connections between them .",
    "this approach has had very little application for quiescent systems to date . of the stellar mass black hole population ,",
    "the most accessible quiescent object is v404  cyg .",
    "v404  cyg is known to vary in x - rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , optical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ir @xcite , and radio @xcite , but none of these studies were coordinated .",
    "@xcite established that optical emission line variations are correlated with the optical continuum .",
    "they also found that the emission line flares exhibited a double - peaked line profile , suggestive of emission distributed across the accretion disk ( see e.g. , @xcite ) rather than arising in localized regions .",
    "this was attributed to irradiation of the outer disk by the variable x - ray source , and hence it was predicted that the x - ray variations should be correlated with the optical .",
    "such correlated variability , also attributed to irradiation , is commonly seen in x - ray bright states in both neutron star systems and black holes ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and many other works ) , but had not been directly observed in quiescent systems .",
    "it is also usually only detected in the optical continuum yielding no kinematic information .",
    "here we report initial results from a coordinated , multiwavelength campaign to test this prediction .",
    "this included x - ray , near - uv , optical , and radio coverage , but this letter discusses only the results from comparing x - ray data with optical spectroscopy .",
    "future works will study the variability properties in more detail and examine the broad - band spectral energy distribution .",
    "_ chandra _  observations on 2003 july 28/29 used the acis camera , in a single 61.2ks observation spanning binary phases 0.510.62 .",
    "the source was positioned on the acis - s3 chip and the @xmath2 sub - array mode was used to reduce the frame - time to 0.4s and hence ensure that pile - up was negligible .",
    "data analysis used ciao 3.0 .",
    "source events were extracted from a 3  radius aperture , retaining events with energies of 0.37.0kev ; a total of 1941 such events were recorded corresponding to an average count rate of 0.03cnts@xmath3 , a factor of five lower than the previous observation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the background count rate was approximately constant , produced @xmath4 counts in the source aperture , and was neglected for subsequent analysis .",
    "the spectrum will not be discussed here , but was very similar to that seen by @xcite .",
    "based on this spectrum , and assuming a distance of 3.5kpc , we estimate that 1cnts@xmath3 corresponds to an unabsorbed 0.37.0kev luminosity of @xmath5ergs@xmath3 .",
    "the first half of our time - resolved optical spectrophotometry was obtained with the isis dual - arm spectrograph on the wht . to maximize efficiency and minimize readout time and noise",
    ", we used the single red - arm mode with the r316r grating and marconi2 ccd .",
    "exposure times were 200s , with @xmath6s dead - time between exposures .",
    "a 4  slit was used to maximize photometric accuracy , so our spectral resolution was determined by the seeing ( median @xmath7 ) , and was typically @xmath8(250kms@xmath3 ) . bias correction and flat fielding were performed using standard iraf techniques .",
    "the slit was aligned to cover the same comparison star as used for our previous observations of the target , and spectra of both of these stars , and the nearby blended star , were extracted with the same techniques previously described ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed relative to a single observation of a cune / cuar lamp .",
    "time - dependent variations in the wavelength calibration were corrected using telluric absorption features .",
    "the on - slit comparison star was calibrated relative to kopff 27 @xcite , and all spectra of v404  cyg  were calibrated relative to this on - slit comparison .",
    "the second half of our optical coverage was provided by the gmos spectrograph on gemini - n .",
    "we used the r831 grating and standard eev ccds .",
    "exposure times were 40s and binning and windowing were used to reduce the dead - time between exposures to 12s . a 5  slit with 1.1  median seeing resulted in a spectral resolution of 5.0  ( 230kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "data reduction , spectral extraction , and wavelength and flux calibration were performed in the same way as for the wht data .",
    "wavelength calibration used a cuar lamp , and flux calibration was performed relative to the same on - slit comparison star as used for the wht observations .",
    "x - ray and optical lightcurves are shown in fig .",
    "[ mwlcfig ] .",
    "dramatic x - ray variability is clearly present with a dynamic range of greater than a factor of twenty , comparable to that seen by @xcite on longer timescales .",
    "the lowest count rates seen in three dips ( d@xmath9d@xmath10 ) correspond to a luminosity of @xmath11ergs@xmath3 , which is comparable to the x - ray luminosities of other quiescent black holes @xcite .",
    "clear correlations are seen between the x - ray flux and that in both h@xmath1  and the optical continuum in overall trends and in the distinct flares ( e.g. , f@xmath9 , f@xmath12 , and f@xmath13 ) .",
    "one unusually fast x - ray flare occurred ( f@xmath10 ) lasting for @xmath14s and reaching a peak count rate ( unresolved in fig .",
    "[ mwlcfig ] ) in excess of 0.25cnts@xmath3 .",
    "while h@xmath1  generally tracks the x - rays rather well , one h@xmath1  flare ( marked f@xmath15 ) occurs when the x - rays are low and declining ; this appears unrelated to x - ray behavior .",
    "the continuum apparently tracks the x - ray behavior less well than h@xmath1 .",
    "cross - correlation functions .",
    "the solid line is derived from the first ( wht ) segment .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the gemini segment , terminated after flare f@xmath13 to avoid contamination by the h@xmath1  flare f@xmath15 .",
    "positive lags correspond to the optical lagging the x - rays . ]    to measure the lag between the x - ray and h@xmath1  lightcurves we calculated interpolation cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ ccffig ] . the wht and gemini data were used unbinned , and cross - correlated against x - ray lightcurves with 200s and 50s time - resolution respectively .",
    "these ccfs exhibit a very similar structure to the line vs.  continuum ccfs presented by @xcite .",
    "there is clearly no large lag in the line response to within a few hundred seconds .",
    "viscous , thermal , and even dynamical timescales in the line - formation region are likely to be greater than this , so coupling on these timescales is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "a lag corresponding to the light travel time across the disk ( @xmath16 ) is possible , and indeed the data suggest a positive lag larger than this .",
    "we do not claim detection of a non - zero lag without more detailed examination of the data , however , and defer this to a later work .",
    "if the lag is larger than expected from light travel times , then one explanation might be a finite reprocessing time , as this might be rather large for the cool atmospheres expected in the disk in quiescence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we show in fig .  [ profilefig ] a section of the spectrum of flare f@xmath9 , calculated as the difference between the spectra during a trough at 21.5hrs and the peak at 22.5hrs .",
    "the h@xmath1  line clearly exhibits double - peaked enhancements during the flare , similar to the difference profiles obtained by @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the line response is dominated by the accretion disk rather than by the companion star or stream - impact point .",
    "we have shown a representative optically thin line profile for comparison , smoothed to match the spectral resolution .",
    "the only characteristics we have attempted to reproduce are the flux and separation of the peaks .",
    "the other parameters assumed are an inner disk radius @xmath17r@xmath18 , black hole mass 12m@xmath19 , and inclination 56@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we assume the emission line surface brightness varies as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the peak separation is well fitted assuming a disk with outer edge at the circularization radius , estimated to be @xmath22 cm assuming parameters from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a significantly smaller outer disk radius , as shown in fig .  [ profilefig ] , is not consistent with the data , although it is possible for the illuminated region to extend to the tidal truncation radius , @xmath23 cm .",
    "this profile is clearly inadequate in other ways ; it does not reproduce the wings or central minimum well , and the asymmetry of the peaks is unaccounted for .",
    "the key result for our purposes , the outer radius of the emitting region , is largely insensitive to modifications to reproduce the shapes of the wings and the core , and the asymmetry , and so is a robust result for this flare .",
    "the other flares are shorter and/or weaker , so the flare line profile is less well constrained .    of f@xmath9 .",
    "the histogram shows the data .",
    "note that the continuum flare spectrum has not been subtracted ; this is approximated by the dashed line .",
    "the smooth lines show representative optically thin line profiles .",
    "the solid line corresponds to an outer edge at @xmath24 ; dashed lines correspond to a tidally truncated disk and dotted lines to a disk extending to @xmath25 . ]",
    "material outside of @xmath24 is expected to have a dynamical timescale of @xmath26hrs .",
    "this is much longer than most of the events in the lightcurve , in particular the early rise to f@xmath9 from which the flare line profile was derived , and is also much longer than any lag between the x - ray and h@xmath1  lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ ccffig ] ) .",
    "the only plausible way to couple the whole line profile to the x - ray variations is therefore through irradiation , as the light travel time to @xmath24 , @xmath27s , is easily short enough .",
    "we note that the dynamical timescale at @xmath24 is actually comparable to the 6hr quasi - periodicity reported in both photometry and line behavior by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ correlationfig ] shows the relationship between x - ray and h@xmath1  luminosities .",
    "there is no evidence for an uncorrelated x - ray component ; the correlation extends to almost zero x - ray flux and the lightcurves show no x - ray features which are not reproduced by h@xmath1  ( except possibly at the very end of the lightcurve ) .",
    "there is , however , an approximately constant component to the h@xmath1emission , which varies only slowly .",
    "@xmath28 ( estimated from a power - law fit to the 0.37.0kev spectrum ) and optical extinction @xmath29 .",
    "the x - ray emission is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "emission has been corrected assuming it originates from a disk at an inclination of 56@xmath20 .",
    "solid points correspond to the interval d@xmath9d@xmath12 ; open symbols correspond to d@xmath12 to the end of f@xmath13 .",
    "the period after f@xmath13 was excluded due to the presence of the h@xmath1  flare f@xmath30 .",
    "circles indicate wht data , triangles are from gemini . dashed lines indicate linear fits . ]    from the linear fits shown in fig .",
    "[ correlationfig ] , the variable component of h@xmath1  luminosity corresponds to 2.0%  of the x - ray luminosity in the first segment and 1.2%  in the second .",
    "neither of the quantities compared are bolometric luminosities .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity ( assumed to be isotropic ) is a lower limit on the bolometric irradiating luminosity , which also includes euv and @xmath31-ray emission .",
    "h@xmath1  provides a lower limit on the reprocessed luminosity .",
    "more detailed modeling will be needed to estimate these bolometric corrections .",
    "if we consider only irradiation that can ionize neutral hydrogen ( i.e.  above 13.6ev ) , and below 100kev then this is unlikely to exceed the x - rays by more than a factor of a few ; for example , it is about a factor of three for a pure power - law spectrum ( photon index @xmath32 ) and a factor of five for model 1 of @xcite .",
    "such a low - energy cut - off is somewhat arbitrary , but is also motivated by the large uncertainty concerning optical synchrotron emission in the models of @xcite .",
    "this contributes most of the truly bolometric luminosity , but is much weaker in more recent models ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath1  will not exceed 2030%  of the reprocessed luminosity , where the limit corresponds to case b recombination @xcite ; it is likely to be substantially less than this .",
    "thus the reprocessed fraction is likely to be at least a few per cent , although this is is not a solid , model - independent constraint .",
    "for a thin disk and isotropic irradiation , the fraction intercepted is approximately @xmath33 , so the lower limit is plausible for a central compact x - ray source irradiating a thin disk ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , there is also a significant component of the optical continuum which is correlated with x - rays ( figs .",
    "[ mwlcfig ]  &  [ profilefig ] ) . if this also originates in reprocessed x - rays then the reprocessed fraction would be larger , as the optical continuum flux exceeds that in h@xmath1  by a factor much larger than plausible bolometric corrections to the irradiating flux .",
    "this case would then favor an elevated or vertically extended x - ray emission geometry which allows more efficient illumination of the disk .",
    "the variable optical continuum component could alternatively be dominated by synchrotron emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have established that optical and x - ray variations in v404  cyg  in quiescence are fairly well correlated .",
    "all x - ray variability ( accounting for essentially all of the observed x - ray flux ) is mirrored well by h@xmath1 , and to a lesser extent by the optical continuum .",
    "there is clearly another component of h@xmath1  emission , which exhibits rarer , or less pronounced variations , but is not completely constant . the correlated h@xmath1  component exhibits double - peaked line profiles indicating emission from a disk .",
    "the peak separation implies that the outer edge of the emitting region is at or outside the circularization radius .",
    "the timescales of the flares , significantly less than the dynamical timescale at the circularization radius , suggest that the x - ray ",
    "h@xmath1  connection is mediated by irradiation of the accretion disk .",
    "the correlated h@xmath1  has a luminosity of approximately 12%  of the 0.37.0kev x - ray luminosity , which is consistent with an irradiation model .",
    "our results therefore demonstrate that x - ray / euv irradiation has a measurable effect even in quiescent bhxrts , and that optical observations can be used to perform an indirect study of x - ray ( i.e. , inner disk ) variability , at least for v404  cyg .",
