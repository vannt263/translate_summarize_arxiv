    "<S> we present results suggesting that magnetic monopoles can account for chiral symmetry breaking in abelian gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> full @xmath0 configurations from a lattice simulation are factorized into magnetic monopole and photon contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation @xmath1 is computed using the monopole configurations and compared to results for the full @xmath0 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that excellent agreement between the two values of @xmath1 is obtained if the effect of photons , which  dress \" the composite operator @xmath2 , is included . </S>",
    "<S> this can be estimated independently by measurements of the physical fermion mass in the photon background .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    @xmath0 lattice gauge theory provides an ideal laboratory for studying the effects of monopoles . in @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> all non - perturbative effects are known to be caused by monopoles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , there is an efficient procedure for identifying the magnetic current of monopoles in the link angle configurations generated in a @xmath0 lattice gauge theory simulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previously , two of the present authors have studied the heavy quark potential in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory , and shown that in the confined phase , the value of the string tension calculated from monopoles agrees quantitatively with the full @xmath0 string tension calculated directly from link angles @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we turn our attention to the quenched chiral condensate in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect ( and find ) that this has a non - zero value in the confined phase , and vanishes in the deconfined phase . </S>",
    "<S> our interest is in how the value of @xmath3 calculated from the link angle configurations compares with the same quantity calculated from monopoles . ascribing non - perturbative effects to monopoles </S>",
    "<S> would say that in the confined phase , a non - vanishing condensate will be induced by monopoles . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , since a matrix element of a product of field operators is involved , this value should be renormalized by short distance perturbative effects _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ photons , so to make a quantitative comparison , we also need to calculate this renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> our method for doing so , described in more detail below , is to compute the ratio of renormalized to bare masses for a charge moving solely in the field of photons . </S>",
    "<S> our principle result is that applying this renormalization factor to the monopole value of @xmath3 yields the full @xmath0 answer , to within statistical errors .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now briefly describe the factorization of the link variables into photon and monopole parts . </S>",
    "<S> we start by resolving the @xmath0 plaquette angles @xmath4 into fluctuating and monopole parts , @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] . from the monopole term @xmath7 , we can define two currents , one electric , the other magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> the electric current is defined by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic current of monopoles is defined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dual of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the currents @xmath11 reside on direct(dual ) lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> we will compute the chiral condensate using the banks - casher formula @xcite ( see below ) which involves the density of eigenvalues of the dirac operator . </S>",
    "<S> since the dirac particle is electrically charged , the effect of monopoles on it must be represented by an electric vector potential . </S>",
    "<S> this four - vector potential derives from the electric current @xmath12 , and is analogous to the familiar three - vector potential @xmath13 used for the case of a static monopole in the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the magnetic unit of charge , and @xmath16 the lattice coulomb propagator in feynman gauge , satisfying @xmath17 . by defining @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> , we define the photon link by demanding that @xmath19 be factorized on each link : @xmath20    we can now examine the chiral condensate @xmath3 separately on configurations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as well as the full @xmath19 . in the quenched approximation @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> can be defined in the chiral limit via the eigenvalues of the dirac operator  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lattice volume and @xmath25 is the number of eigenvalues satisfying @xmath26 in the interval @xmath27 , with @xmath28 $ ] the staggered lattice fermion kinetic operator @xmath29={1\\over2}\\sum_\\mu ( -1)^{x_1+\\cdots+x_{\\mu-1 } } \\left(u_\\mu(x)\\delta_{y , x+\\hat\\mu}-u_\\mu^*(y)\\delta_{y , x-\\hat\\mu}\\right).\\ ] ] for finite @xmath24 , @xmath30 vanishes ; therefore an extrapolation to the @xmath31 limit must be made from the spectrum density at non - zero @xmath32 . in practice @xmath33 can be estimated by measuring the lowest @xmath34 eigenvalues of @xmath35 per configuration using the lanczos algorithm , and then using a binning procedure  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the chiral condensate were performed with @xmath0 configurations generated using the standard wilson action on a @xmath36 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> three different values of the inverse coupling @xmath37 were chosen : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> for each value of @xmath37 , 5000 lattice updates were performed before beginning measurements to allow for equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> the next 4000 configurations were used for measurements skipping every 20 lattice updates to reduce correlations . for values @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> , our results exhibited the breaking of chiral symmetry ( i.  e. @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two values of @xmath37 are known to correspond to the confinement phase as well@xcite . for @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> the configurations were found to be in the chirally symmetric phase , which is coincident with the coulomb phase .    </S>",
    "<S> our results for the chiral condensate calculations for the chirally broken phase are presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show both the full @xmath0 calculations and the results from the monopole gauge field configurations obtained using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . using a linear fit and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , the value of the chiral condensate was extracted from the 10 lowest values of @xmath33 . the values for @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> are shown in table  i.    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the results for the chiral condensate from full @xmath0 fields and monopoles are shown for @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the results from the @xmath44 monopole configurations are also included . </S>",
    "<S> linear fits to @xmath33 yield a very small , but finite intercept . </S>",
    "<S> however , the values are found to be about a factor of 100 times smaller than the results in the broken phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are confident of being in the chirally symmetric phase for @xmath42 . for completeness , the @xmath42 results are also included in table  i.    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) we show the eigenvalue spectrum calculated using the @xmath22 background from both broken and symmetric phases . </S>",
    "<S> there is no signal of chiral symmetry breaking ( note that we choose anti - periodic boundary conditions for the fermions in the temporal direction to avoid zero modes from near - plane wave solutions ) . </S>",
    "<S> this supports our conjecture that chiral symmetry breaking in this model can be ascribed entirely to monopoles .    </S>",
    "<S> is it possible to account for the mismatch between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ? </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath2 is a composite field operator , we expect it to be modified by quantum corrections independently of whether it acquires a vacuum expectation value . in perturbation </S>",
    "<S> theory , uv fluctuations in general result in the requirement for all field operators to be renormalized , and for composite operators to have an additional renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> this consideration leads us to the following hypothesis : the mismatch between the two condensate measurements is due to the rescaling of the @xmath2 operator by the fluctuations of the gauge fields contained in the @xmath22 configurations ; more concisely @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dressed operator which takes into account photon - like fluctuations , and the expectation value is taken in the monopole - only backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> if the hypothesis is correct , then we can write @xmath49 ie . </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level operator is multiplicatively enhanced by the photon fluctuations , the condensate data suggesting that the factor @xmath50 .    in support </S>",
    "<S> , we now describe an alternative and independent determination of @xmath51 , obtained by measuring the physical fermion mass @xmath52 in the @xmath22 background . on the assumption that the fluctuations in @xmath22 are approximately gaussian , </S>",
    "<S> then the dressing of the @xmath2 operator is given by a set of feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath53 denote the complete set of 1pi diagrams describing corrections to the fermion two - point function . </S>",
    "<S> then for the dressed fermion propagator we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath52 denote bare and physical fermion masses respectively , @xmath56 is a wavefunction rescaling which by analogy with perturbative qed we expect to be both gauge and cutoff - dependent , and the @xmath57 symbol shows that the second equality holds only in the neighborhood of some subtraction point @xmath58 . equation ( [ eq : dressedprop ] ) may be rearranged to read @xmath59 with @xmath60 now , using the identity @xmath61 we see that the operation of differentiating with respect to @xmath55 is equivalent to a zero momentum insertion of a @xmath2 operator in a feynman diagram . therefore @xmath62 is the set of 1pi diagrams , having one external @xmath63 and one external @xmath64 , which describe corrections to @xmath2 , ie . @xmath65 ie . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rescaling factor we seek , and the factor @xmath56 is included because in the diagrammatic approach matrix elements are evaluated with dressed fermion propagators on the external legs . combining ( [ eq : zmdef ] ) with ( [ eq : zdef ] ) , we find @xmath68 hence a measurement of @xmath52 in the @xmath22 background as a function of @xmath55 gives an independent estimate of @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> this argument is essentially the same as that used to establish @xmath69 in standard renormalized perturbation theory , where @xmath70 is the renormalized operator whose green functions with other renormalized fields and operators are finite  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we make no attempt to define a renormalized operator , since bare quantities are evaluated in a lattice simulation , but rather use the same formalism to quantify the effects of operator enhancement by quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have not specified the subtraction point defining @xmath51 very precisely , and have assumed that @xmath51 is independent of @xmath55 . from experience in perturbation theory , we expect that numerically the most significant contribution to @xmath51 , of @xmath71 , comes from short wavelength fluctuations , and that @xmath51 is relatively insensitive to the details of the subtraction .    to measure the physical fermion mass in the @xmath22 background , we performed calculations of the fermion propagator starting with the same configurations used to compute @xmath33 . since the fermion propagator is not gauge invariant , it is first necessary to fix a gauge . </S>",
    "<S> although a gauge transformation of @xmath22 is not strictly a symmetry of the full theory , this procedure is justified since @xmath2 , and by hypothesis @xmath52 , are gauge invariant . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have used landau gauge @xcite and extracted the lattice fermion timeslice propagator @xmath72+m_0)_{0,x}^{-1}\\biggr\\rangle^{phot}\\ ] ] using a conjugate gradient routine , for bare mass values @xmath73 . the restriction to spatial sites an even number of lattice spacings from the origin in each direction improves the signal  @xcite . note that we have not attempted to fix the residual gauge freedom as in @xcite , but have instead relied on the fluctuations in @xmath22 being intrinsically small ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physical mass @xmath52 can now be estimated by fitting @xmath74 to the following functional form : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the lattice size in the time direction . </S>",
    "<S> we used 100 configurations from each of the three @xmath37 values previously studied . in order to take into account correlations between renormalized mass estimates due to using the same configurations for different bare masses we applied a bootstrap fitting routine .    to determine @xmath51 we plotted the mass obtained from @xmath74 against the input bare mass , and fitted the results to a linear form : @xmath77 fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) shows a graph of @xmath78 from our simulation for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the graphs for the other two values of @xmath37 are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath51 and @xmath79 from the linear fits for each value of @xmath37 are shown in table  ii . from the table it can be observed that the value of @xmath51 is a smooth function through the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> unexpected in our results were the small non - zero values of the intercept . </S>",
    "<S> this will be discussed briefly below .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our value of @xmath51 calculated using @xmath22 with the value observed in the chiral condensate calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we define the renormalization factor from the chiral condensate to be @xmath80 and present the comparison in table  iii . </S>",
    "<S> the two independent determinations of the renormalization factor show excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> this answers the question asked earlier : is it possible to account for the mismatch between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ? </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the mismatch is simply operator renormalization due to the photons .    </S>",
    "<S> as yet we have no satisfactory explanation for the non - zero intercepts in table  ii , implying a small breaking of chiral symmetry in the photon - only configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it could be either a finite volume effect , or perhaps a residual gauge freedom associated with gribov copies and the consequent non - uniqueness of the landau gauge , or perhaps due to spatially constant gauge field modes . </S>",
    "<S> the only effect that we have investigated quantitatively is that of constant modes . </S>",
    "<S> we repeated our previous calculations at @xmath81 , this time performing a global gauge transformation to remove constant modes from the gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> this was done in the following way : the full gauge fields were shifted by a direction dependent constant , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is chosen so @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the new gauge fields @xmath85 were used to recompute @xmath51 and the chiral condensates . in repeating the calculations with this gauge fixing we observed no measurable difference in the results .    </S>",
    "<S> although we are not able to explain the small non - zero intercepts , the overall agreement of the slope with the value of @xmath51 required to explain the condensate results is extremely satisfying , and supports our hypothesis on the role of the residual photon fluctuations enhancing the @xmath2 operator .    an obvious direction in which to extend this analysis is the exploration of chiral symmetry breaking in non - abelian gauge theories following the identification of monopole networks after abelian projection . studies of this kind have already appeared  @xcite ; it is interesting to note that in the maximal abelian gauge used , there is a similar mismatch in the measured values of @xmath3 between full and monopole - only configurations </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to check whether this effect could be accounted for by the operator renormalization described here .    </S>",
    "<S> finally note that even though this argument assumed a split of the background gauge field into gaussian fluctuations , described by feynman diagrams , and non - perturbative monopole - only configurations , the idea of classifying effects into those which rescale a local operator and those which lead to a non - vanishing expectation value for the operator may be generalized . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it may in principle be possible to extend the analysis by factoring configurations in a scale dependent fashion , including only large monopole loops in the monopole part , and seeing if small monopole loops simply renormalize @xmath2 by comparing the @xmath51 factors measured in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> this may prove to be an effective probe of the scale at which non - perturbative effects manifest themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence of monopole contributions to the string tension was studied in @xcite . </S>"
