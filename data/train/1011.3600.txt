    "a new renormalizable gravity theory in four dimensions , proposed by hoava @xcite , may be regarded as a uv complete candidate for general relativity . at large distances",
    "the theory reduces to einstein gravity with a non - vanishing cosmological constant in ir , but with improved uv behavior . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , from the ir - modified hoava action , which reduces to the standard einstein - hilbert action in the ir limit , one obtains the analogue of the standard spherically symmetric schwarzschild-(a)ds black - hole solution .",
    "in this paper we employ such a class of black holes by starting with two copies thereof and constructing a traversable thin - shell wormhole by means of the cut - and - paste technique @xcite . to compare and contrast the two gravitational theories , we discuss various aspects of these wormholes , such as the location of the event horizons , the energy density of the thin shell , the violation of the weak energy condition at the junction surface , the amount of exotic matter required , and the equation of state . our final topic is the question of stability to a linearized spherically symmetric perturbation .",

    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are dimensionless coupling constants , while the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 are dimensionful .",

    "( [ e : gtt ] ) , one obtains the kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) black - hole solution @xcite : @xmath15 finally , since @xmath7 , we now have @xmath16    the kehagias - sfetsos solution is the only asymptotically flat solution in the family of solutions ( [ e : gtt ] ) .",
    "we will therefore use the kehagias - sfetsos solution for constructing the thin - shell wormhole from hoava - lifshitz black holes .",
    "it is to be noted that there is an outer ( event ) horizon @xmath17 , and an inner ( cauchy ) horizon @xmath18 of the kehagias - sfetsos black - hole solution for @xmath19 at    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    compared to @xmath21 for the schwarzschild case , i.e. , in einstein gravity .",

    "the dotted , dashed , long dashed , and chain curves correspond to @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the thick solid lines corresponds to the schwarzschild case .",
    "the blue , black , red and brown colors represent @xmath27 , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the mathematical construction of a thin - shell wormhole , when first proposed by visser @xcite , used a flat minkowski space as a starting point .",
    "the construction itself , however , relies on a topological identification of two surfaces and is not confined to a particular type of geometry .",
    "so we can safely start with two copies of a kehagias - sfetsos black hole and remove from each the four - dimensional region @xmath28 we assume that @xmath29 , the larger of the two radii .",
    "the construction proceeds by identifying ( in the sense of topology ) the timelike hypersurfaces @xmath30 denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "thanks to the asymptotic flatness referred to above , the resulting manifold is geodesically complete and consists of two asymptotically flat regions connected by a throat , namely @xmath32 .",
    "our main goal is to compare various characteristics of hoava - lifshitz gravity and einstein gravity , such as the surface stress - energy tensor and the basic question of stability .",
    "a complete analysis would require , as always , a detailed knowledge of the junction conditions , but the traditional method , using the lanczos equations , does not automatically carry over to kehagias - sfetsos black holes without an additional assumption .",
    "so let us return to eq .",
    "( [ e : eventhorizons ] ) and fig .",
    "1 , neither of which depends on the junction conditions , to gain an overview : the effect of the convergence to the schwarzschild case can be clearly seen for the event horizons .",
    "but the convergence of the ks solution to the schwarzschild solution is true in general and never depends on the junction conditions . from this standpoint",
    ", all well - constructed plots can be expected to show certain trends that allow a comparison between the two gravitational theories . indeed",
    ", all the plots to follow show the gradual departure from the schwarzschild limit as @xmath33 decreases .",
    "the ability to make the relevant comparisons justifies the assumption that the thin - shell formalism is at least _",
    "qualitatively _ acceptable , given that the use of plots is essentially qualitative in nature .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "7 shows that the amount of exotic matter required is _ less _ for the ks case than for the schwarzschild case , which is indeed a qualitative statement .",
    "( this point will be reiterated from time to time when making the comparisons . )    a final observation in fig .",
    "1 is that the plot for @xmath34 starts taking on a very different form from that of the schwarzschild case for small values of @xmath32 , enough to cast some doubt on the validity .",
    "this suspicion is readily confirmed by the fact that in some cases the results are actually unphysical for sufficiently small values of @xmath33 ; such values may therefore be disregarded as meaningless .    with these caveats in mind",
    ", we will proceed with the assumption that the induced metric on @xmath31 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proper time on the junction surface .",
    "it follows from the lanczos equations @xcite , @xmath37     -\\delta^i_{\\phantom{i}j}[k]\\right),\\ ] ] that the surface stress - energy tensor is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the surface energy density and @xmath40 is the surface pressure .",
