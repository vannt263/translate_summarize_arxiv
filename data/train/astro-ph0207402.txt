    "changes in the frequency of the solar @xmath1-mode oscillations have now been observed for more than a decade .",
    "such changes affect both the central frequencies , @xmath2 , and the frequency splittings , @xmath3 of low degree @xcite , intermediate degree @xcite and very high degree modes @xcite .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain these variations on frequency . @xcite",
    "have argued , on the basis of observations of intermediate degree modes , that the source of the perturbations must lie near the solar surface . @xcite and @xcite concluded that magnetic fields located near the base of the convection zone , with strengths significantly lower than @xmath4 g have no observable effect on @xmath1-mode frequencies .",
    "the stability analysis for magnetic fields by @xcite has shown that fields with strengths significantly larger than @xmath5 g can not be stored in this region .",
    "the @xmath1-mode frequency variations track rather well the changes of the activity strength of the solar cycle with time .",
    "it is thus plausible that these frequency shifts are due to variations of the mean magnetic field near the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the influence of thin magnetic fibrils on the frequency shifts has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "another possible cause for these frequency shifts is the presence of sunspots during solar activity @xcite .",
    "the dominant effect of sunspots on the propagation of acoustic waves is believed to be the dissipation of the acoustic energy and therefore , should decrease their amplitudes and lifetimes @xcite , while it has been observed that frequencies increase with increased magnetic activity .    in the work presented here ,",
    "we explore a mechanism first suggested by @xcite , in which the sound speed perturbation associated to the observed changes of the photospheric latitudinal temperature distribution might be responsible for the frequency shifts seen during the solar cycle .",
    "changes in the temperature distribution are themselves due to the heat transport through the convection zone induced by the solar dynamo .",
    "let us suppose that there is a magnetic field anchored below the base of the convection zone . to maintain pressure equilibrium , the gas pressure and thus the density inside the magnetized region must be lower than in its surroundings . the magnetized fluid will thus experience a larger radiative heating and therefore the temperature at the top of the magnetized region will increase .",
    "this will also induce a change in the temperature gradient that could be large enough to make the region above the magnetic field convectively unstable .",
    "in such a scenario , the base of the convection zone would locally drop , allowing the magnetized fluid to ascend by convective upflows , transporting excess entropy to the photosphere @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments by @xcite have shown that entropy perturbations in the deep convection zone can produce strongly peaked temperature changes in regions below @xmath6 that have a substantial acoustic signature ( where @xmath7 is the optical depth ) .",
    "they have also shown that the thermal perturbations that account for the solar acoustic variability are consistent with the observed solar irradiance and luminosity changes that occur during the 11 year solar cycle .",
    "luminosity changes , even if no larger than @xmath8 , must come from the release of energy stored somewhere in the solar interior and must be accompanied by a change in the solar radius .",
    "the ratio between relative luminosity and radius changes , hereafter @xmath9 , can help estimate the location of the region where this energy is stored ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that @xmath9 increases when increasing the depth of the source of the variations in luminosity . for instance",
    "@xmath10 if the source is located in the outer layers of the convection zone , while @xmath11 if the source is located in the solar core .",
    "unfortunately there is a large scatter in the observed values of @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , recent measurements of @xmath9 range from 0.021 as estimated by @xcite and @xcite to an upper limit of 0.08 derived by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that a @xmath8 luminosity perturbation integrated over a solar cycle corresponds to about @xmath12 erg .",
    "if this energy originates in the tachocline and if the tachocline thickness is @xmath13 , the associated relative variation in sound speed at that depth would be on the order of @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "fractional changes in sound speed as small as @xmath16 are easily accessible by helioseismic inversion techniques .",
    "some attempts to find solar - cycle variations of the sound speed asphericity and the latitude - averaged sound speed have been carried out using mdi and/or gong data @xcite . however , none of them found any systematic variation of the solar structure at the base of the convection zone that could be associated with the presence of a local toroidal magnetic field .",
    "we have extended the previous analysis to the latest data available , including lowl data . only common modes to all data sets were used , in an attempt to obtain comparable and significant results to all instruments .",
    "this way , we can give a robust upper limit on the temporal variations of the solar internal stratification during the period 1994 - 2001 .",
    "the inversion for solar structure , in particular sound speed @xmath17 and density @xmath18 , are commonly based on the linearization of the equations of stellar oscillations around a reference model @xcite .",
    "the differences of the structural profile between the actual sun and a model are linearly related to differences between the observed frequencies and those calculated using that model .",
    "this relation is obtained using a variational formulation for the frequencies of adiabatic oscillations . a general relation for frequency differences",
    "is given by @xmath19 dr }   \\label{test2 } \\\\",
    "~&~ & + \\ { \\cal e}^{-1}_{nl}f(\\nu ) + \\epsilon_{nl } \\nonumber \\label{test3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the frequency differences between the actual sun and the model for the mode with radial order @xmath21 and degree @xmath22 , and @xmath23 the corresponding relative error .",
    "the sensitivity functions , or kernels , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are known functions , that relate the changes in frequency to the changes in the model .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the unknown parameters to be inverted , _",
    "i.e. _ : the relative difference in the sound speed and the density respectively , and @xmath28 is the solar radius .",
    "the term @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ test2 ] is introduced to take into account the so - called surface uncertainties ; these include the dynamical effects of convection on the oscillation equations , as well as non - adiabatic processes in the near - surface layers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "following standard procedures , we represent @xmath30 as a legendre polynomial expansion .",
    "@xmath31 is the inertia of the mode , normalized by the inertia that a radial mode of the same frequency would have ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "if we take @xmath20 as the differences in the observed frequencies at two different epochs , rather than the differences in frequency between the actual sun and the model , @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the variation with time of the sun s internal structure , as long as our underlying theoretical model is very close to the actual sun .    the inverse problem defined by eq .",
    "[ test2 ] is well known to be an ill - posed problem @xcite , whose solution is not unique .",
    "it can be solved using inversion methodologies that can be classified in two different techniques : the regularized least - squares methods ( rls , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the optimal localized average methods ( ola , * ? ? ?",
    "both methods compute an estimate of the solution at a target location from a linear combinations of the observables , given a mesh of target locations .",
    "we have developed a variant of the rls technique , that we call the optimal mesh distribution ( omd ) , that optimizes the mesh of target locations to avoid undesired high - frequency oscillations of the solution .",
    "this optimization is achieved by computing _ a priori _ the spatial resolution of the solution from the set of available observables and their uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the smoothing function is itself defined also from the spatial resolution analysis and it is weighted differently for each radial point .",
    "this method ensures that the smoothing constraint is properly applied over the optimal mesh .",
    "the observational data consist of mode frequencies computed from time series spanning different epochs and observed with different instruments .",
    "namely , 57 sets based on 108-day - long time series derived from the gong instruments @xcite and spanning may 1995 to february 2001 ; 27 sets based on 72-day - long time series derived from the mdi instrument @xcite and spanning may 1996 to november 2001 ; and 6 sets based on 1-year - long time series derived from the lowl instrument @xcite and spanning 1994 to 1999 .    in order to use consistent data sets ,",
    "only the modes common to all the sets for a given instrument were taken into account . as a consequence ,",
    "the low degree modes @xmath32 present in some gong data sets had to be rejected .",
    "also this selection reduces the number of mdi and lowl modes by @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the mdi and lowl sets were further reduced to only include the modes common to both instruments .",
    "this was not done with the gong data set due to the small amount of common modes present .",
    "finally , and again for consistency , we deliberately restricted range of degrees we included to correspond to the highest degree available in the lowl data set ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath35 ) .    for each instrument and for each mode we computed the temporal frequency average .",
    "we subsequently subtracted the respective averaged frequencies from each set , leaving us with frequency changes with respect to this temporal average as a function of epoch .",
    "for the gong and mdi sets , we also computed averages corresponding to 1-year - long epochs . such averaging reduced the scatter of the data while producing data sets comparable to the lowl sets .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the relative change of the sound speed as a function of radius inferred from 1-year - long mdi , gong and lowl sets .",
    "these profiles show no significant changes at the level of a few times @xmath36",
    ". the precision and resolution of the inversion is good enough to detect small variations of the stratification at the base of the convection zone .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we show the sound speed profiles inferred from the 1996 averaged mdi , gong and lowl data sets as well as sound speed profiles obtained by inverting the same mode sets , but after injecting frequency changes that result from a perturbation in the sound speed ( as small as @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this figure indicates that a perturbation of the sound speed at the base of the convection zone on the order of , or slightly smaller than @xmath41 , can be detected with the current precision resulting from 1-year - long time - series .",
    "perturbations on the order of @xmath15 fall in the noise level of our inversions .    in an attempt to find temporal variations of the solar stratification at the base of the convection zone , we computed the mean value of @xmath42 in the radial interval @xmath43 .",
    "this interval contains not only the base of the convection zone , @xmath44 @xcite , but also the tachocline , @xmath45 @xcite , both closely related to the toroidal magnetic field responsible of the solar cycle .",
    "the resulting values are shown as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for the inversions based on 1-year - long sets for all three instruments ( gong , mdi and lowl ) , as well as on the gong 108-day - long and mdi 72-day - long sets .",
    "inversion profiles inferred from any linear inversion technique always correspond to the convolution of the underlying solution by the resolution kernel @xcite .",
    "therefore , even if the mode set used in a sequence of inversions remains identical , the resolution kernels will , at some level , change with time since the uncertainties change with time . such variation could produce an _ apparent _ temporal behavior of the inferred profiles that does not correspond to a _ real _ variation of the underlying _ true _ solution . to quantify this effect , we computed the averaging kernels at @xmath46 for all the inversions based on 1-year - long data sets .",
    "these were convolved with an artificial sound speed perturbation of the form : @xmath47 where the sound speed perturbation centered at @xmath48 attempts to reproduce the results found by @xcite , while a second perturbation at the base of the convection zone is also introduced .",
    "the convolutions @xmath49 are then calculated in the following way :    @xmath50    the resulting values of @xmath49 , at @xmath51 , relative to the average @xmath52 of all the convolutions calculated for every instrument , are shown in fig .",
    "this figure demonstrates that for the data from all three instruments the effect of the changes in the observed uncertainties on the inverted profiles is negligible , corresponding to levels well below @xmath53 .",
    "the averaging kernel corresponding to the solution at @xmath46 obtained from the 1997 mdi data set is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "this is well located and indicates that our radial resolution corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "we should also point out that the averaging kernels have an important negative non - local contribution near the surface , a feature that affect at some level the solution at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the effect of this non - local component of the averaging kernels was quantified , in the case of mdi and gong data , by performing inversions with data sets expanded to higher degrees , _",
    "i.e. _ , up to @xmath55",
    ". the averaging kernel at @xmath46 obtained from the mdi 1997 data shows a substantial reduction of the negative component located at @xmath56 when including higher degree modes .",
    "but the temporal behavior of the stratification at the base of the convection zone do not significantly differ when the mdi data sets are expanded from @xmath35 to @xmath57 , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    therefore , by including the data from all three instruments , and after assessing the effects of temporal changes of the resolution of the solutions , we can safely conclude that there is not significant systematic variations of the stratification at the base of the convection zone at the level of @xmath58 , and that this upper limit is constrained by the scatter present in the data .",
    "@xcite analyzed mdi data spanning from 1996 to 2000 and found systematic variations of the radial solar stratification with time , expressed as relative changes of radius of @xmath59 .",
    "our results obtained with mdi data are in good agreement with those found by @xcite , in the sense that there is a systematic variation in the relative sound speed difference that is well correlated to the magnetic activity in the sun .",
    "the maximum in solar activity corresponds to the maximum variation in sound speed .",
    "since these results are not seen when analyzing lowl and gong data they should still be taken with some degree of scepticism .",
    "the solar oscillations investigation - michelson doppler imager project on soho is supported by nasa grant nas53077 at stanford university .",
    "soho is a project of international cooperation between esa and nasa .",
