    "among the various areas where multifractality occurs ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , the case of critical points in the presence of frozen disorder is of particular interest .",
    "the idea that multifractality occurs at criticality has been first established for quantum anderson localization transitions @xcite and has been the subject of very detailed studies @xcite . for the directed polymer in a random medium in dimension @xmath14 , where a disorder - induced localization / delocalization occurs , the multifractal properties studied recently @xcite are very similar to the case of anderson transitions . in the field of spin models , the most studied case seems to be the two - dimensional diluted @xmath15-state potts model , where multifractality was discovered by ludwig @xcite via conformal field theory using perturbation theory in the parameter @xmath16 governing the disorder relevance .",
    "this work has motivated numerical studies for various values of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the idea of multifractality has been also proposed in other disordered models like spin - glasses and random field spin systems @xcite , and has been studied numerically for spin glasses on diamond hierarchical lattice @xcite .",
    "finally , for disordered quantum spin - chains , it turns out that the statistics of critical correlation functions is described by `` multiscaling '' , which is even stronger than multifractality @xcite .",
    "this is because these disordered quantum spin - chains are actually governed by `` infinite disorder fixed points '' @xcite .",
    "so the presence of multifractality at criticality seems generic in disordered systems .",
    "however , following @xcite , most studies on classical disordered models have focused on the statistics of two - point correlation functions , whereas multifractality already occurs at the level of one - point functions like the order parameter or the energy density @xcite . in particular , the moments of the local order parameter scale with a set @xmath17 of non - trivial exponents @xmath18 . in this paper , we revisit these ideas in the light of more recent findings , concerning the possible differences between the exponents for typical and averaged values , and the lack of self - averaging of thermodynamic observables at criticality @xcite .",
    "we then study the multifractal statistics of the order parameter in random polymer models that can be studied numerically for large sizes and good statistics over the samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we summarize the outcome of previous works concerning the multifractal statistics and the lack of self - averaging at random critical points . in the remainder of the paper , we apply these ideas to wetting transitions with disorder .",
    "these random polymer models are presented in section [ models ] .",
    "our numerical results on the statistics of the local order parameter are given respectively in sections [ resc1.75 ] for loop exponent @xmath10 ( relevant disorder ) and in section [ resc1.5 ] for loop exponent @xmath9 ( marginal disorder ) .",
    "in section [ boundary ] , we discuss the influence of boundary conditions on the multifractal spectrum .",

    "since the multifractal formalism is usually defined for a normalized probability measure @xcite , it is convenient to construct a probability measure from the non - normalized observables one is interested in @xcite . here for the local order parameter , one defines in each sample @xmath34 the following spatial weights @xmath35 normalized to @xmath36 so @xmath37 represents the contribution of the site @xmath20 to the order parameter of the sample @xmath21 of size @xmath22 .",
