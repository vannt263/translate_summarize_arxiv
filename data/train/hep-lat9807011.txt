    "in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in possible use of improved actions to lattice qcd .",
    "there exist different improvement schemes for lattice actions and observables , all which aim at the extraction of continuum physics from simulations on coarse lattices .",
    "the simplest of these improvement schemes is the clover action , an @xmath1 improvement of the wilson fermion action suggested by sheikholeslami and wohlert @xcite , who implemented the symanzik improvement @xcite for the dirac operator .",
    "several calculations in quenched and some in full qcd have been performed using this action especially to calculate both heavy and light hadron masses . the results obtained seem promising , so that one might want to check the improvement effects of the clover action in a simple and well - known toy model . here",
    "we study the effects of the @xmath1 improvement of the wilson action in the full lattice schwinger model .",
    "this model seems optimally suited for this purpose .",
    "massless qed in @xmath4 dimension was first studied by schwinger @xcite as an example of an explicitly solvable qft . in subsequent papers",
    "@xcite the model was generalized to allow for fermion masses and include different flavors .",
    "the schwinger model became of considerable interest during the early 1970 s , because it shows some remarkable features  like fermion confinement or a @xmath5-vacuum structure  which are reminiscent of qcd .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , it is sufficient to note , that the massless @xmath6-flavor schwinger model has a spectrum which consists of one massive isosinglet boson and a isomultiplet of @xmath7 massless fermion - antifermion bound states ( for further discussion cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the isosinglet state , the schwinger mass ( in lattice units ) is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the dimensionless gauge coupling .",
    "in the next section some technical details about the definition and the numerical simulation will be given and in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the effect of the improvement on the rotation invariance of the propagator , the phase diagram and the dispersion relations of the schwinger boson .",
    "the fermionic part of the wilson action for the massive , n - flavor schwinger model is @xmath10 the fields have @xmath11 components , @xmath12 are the pauli matrices . this action has a classical @xmath1 error introduced by the wilson term , which can be removed @xcite by rotating the fermion fields @xmath13 and adding a term @xmath14 to the action .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the clover - leaf discretization of the field strength tensor .",
    "the resulting lattice dirac operator now has discretization errors of @xmath16 .",
    "we note in passing that for this model one may introduce a topological charge in its ` geometric ' definition @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath18 introduces a local coupling of @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath21 , which generally has to be determined non - perturbatively at finite @xmath22 , is just @xmath23 in 2d , since the gauge coupling @xmath24 is dimensionful and therefore @xmath25 , which only gives corrections to higher order in @xmath26 .",
    "since the gauge part of the wilson action @xmath27 has @xmath16 discretization errors , the total action @xmath28 together with ( [ frot ] ) gives a lattice version of the schwinger model with discretization errors of @xmath16 .",
    "we have done a mc simulation of the schwinger model , using both the wilson and the sw action , with two degenerate flavors of dynamical fermions .",
    "we used a hybrid monte carlo algorithm with 10 integration steps and a trajectory length tuned for a @xmath29 acceptance rate of the mc step . for fermion matrix inversion we used a standard conjugate gradient algorithm , and there was no problem with its convergence or stability .",
    "in that algorithm the doubling of the fermionic species is required in order to guarantee positivity of the fermionic determinant  one of our reasons to study the schwinger model with two flavors .    in our implementation",
    ", the speed loss when including the clover term into the action is consistently @xmath30 .",
    "depending on the lattice size ( from @xmath31 up to @xmath32 ) and couplings , we skipped @xmath33 to @xmath34 configurations between measurements and finally had between @xmath35 and @xmath36 independent configurations . to check for ergodicity",
    ", we measured the topological charge ( using the geometric definition ) and observed , that in each run the system tunneled several times between different topological sectors .",
    "the additional term in the action affects the critical @xmath37 value where the theory has effectively massless fermions .",
    "since the clover action is supposedly closer to the continuum ( has smaller corrections to leading scaling behavior ) , we might expect less renormalization of @xmath38 with a value closer to its continuum value of @xmath39 even for small @xmath22 .    in order to determine @xmath40 we follow suggestions @xcite to utilize the pcac relation as discussed in @xcite for the schwinger model . at each @xmath22",
    "we measured an observable proportional to the effective fermion mass for @xmath41 different @xmath37 values and determined @xmath38 .",
    "our result for a @xmath31 lattice is compared with the result for the original wilson fermion action in fig .",
    "[ phd ] .",
    "the values @xmath38 for the clover action are in fact closer to @xmath39 .",
    "however , both , wilson and clover action have corrections @xmath42 the dependence on the finite lattice volume is weak and  for the wilson action  is discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the spectral distribution of the dirac operator is of some interest with regard to topological and chiral properties of the system .",
    "recent studies for the schwinger model @xcite and for the sw - action in 4d @xcite have emphasized these aspects .",
    "[ swspectrum ] should be compared with typical spectra for the pure wilson dirac operator ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .    as compared to the wilson action with its @xmath43 and @xmath44 symmetries we observe for the sw operator an agglomeration of eigenvalues at larger distances from 0 .",
    "this feature may improve somewhat the separation of the low - lying states from the doubling states already at moderate @xmath22 .",
    "for the continuum limit the distribution density of small eigenvalues is of relevance .",
    "however , the distribution is not much closer to the circular shape one obtains for fixed point actions @xcite or neuberger - projected actions @xcite .",
    "we can not identify a clear signal of improvement in this respect for the sw dirac operator .",
    "we measured the propagators of the pseudoscalar isotriplet ( @xmath45 ) mesonic bound states . in the 2-flavor model these modes are expected to be massless at @xmath38 . for short distances on the lattice ,",
    "the rotation invariance of these propagators is clearly broken when using wilson action .",
    "generally , improved actions are expected to show better rotation invariance ( cf .",
    "the schwinger model fp action study in @xcite ) .",
    "one must be careful not to compare these quantities simply at the same values of @xmath22 and @xmath37 , but at values corresponding to comparable discretization of the same continuum theory .",
    "we choose to compare the propagators at @xmath46 and the respective @xmath38 , so that we have a discretization of the massless ( fermion ) theory in both cases .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[rot ] .",
    "we find no noticeable improvement of rotation invariance when using the clover action .",
    "the relative error of the diagonal @xmath47 propagator compared to the @xmath48 and @xmath49 propagators is @xmath50 for both actions .",
    "this is the first indication , that short distance ( high momentum ) observables are not improved .",
    "[ disp ] shows the dispersion relations for the massive ( isosinglet vector ) and the massless ( isotriplet vector ) meson at @xmath46 and @xmath51 on a @xmath52 lattice .",
    "no improvement for the high momentum behavior is observed .    concerning the mass of the massive boson",
    ", however , the improvement is significant .",
    "[ mass ] shows the ratio of the observed schwinger mass over its continuum value at @xmath53 on a @xmath52 and @xmath54 , @xmath51 on a @xmath32 lattice . assuming the continuum scaling behavior @xmath55 these are different discretizations of the same physical system size @xmath56 .",
    "the improvement when including the clover term is quite obvious .",
    "the scaling corrections are remarkably smaller for the clover results .",
    "this behavior , the considerable improvement of low momentum states and the lack thereof for high momentum states , is no surprise when one considers , that the construction of symanzik improved actions aims at improving the fermion dispersion relations for low momenta ( cf .",
    "the overall improvement of the fixed point action in @xcite ( which , however has more than hundred terms per site in the action ) is definitely more pronounced and extends to high momenta as well .",
    "we performed a monte carlo simulation on the 2-flavor lattice schwinger model , comparing standard wilson to an @xmath1 improved sheikholeslami - wohlert action .",
    "we found the following results :    * the critical value of the hopping parameter @xmath38 moves closer to its continuum value @xmath39 .",
    "* the eigenvalue spectrum of the lattice sw dirac operator changes but does not appear to improve significantly towards , e.g. a circular shape .",
    "* there was no improvement in the rotation invariance of meson propagators . for the meson dispersion relations",
    ", there is no improvement in the high momentum states .",
    "* there is considerable improvement in the scaling behavior of the schwinger mass of the massive boson .",
    "these observations are consistent with the fact that the sw action is constructed as an improved action for low momentum fermionic states @xmath57 . while there is considerable improvement in low momentum observables , high momentum observables are largely unaffected by the addition of the clover term .",
    "for the full fermion qcd simulations this suggests that it is preferable to use the clover action as long as one is only interested in the mass spectrum of the theory . on the other hand",
    ", some observables will likely show no improvement at all , especially those connected with high momentum states .",
