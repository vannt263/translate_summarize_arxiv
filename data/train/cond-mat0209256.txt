    "the discovery of mgb@xmath0 with t@xmath5 40 k @xcite has led to the search of related materials that may show superconductivity .",
    "an important feature required for strong electron - phonon coupling in this class of materials is that the b - c bonding @xmath6 bands need to be partially unfilled as in mgb@xmath0 , which is not the case in alb@xmath0.@xcite several isostructural transition metal diborides exist,@xcite but their electronic structures are entirely different and not conducive to high temperature superconductivity .",
    "some of the present authors have proposed@xcite that hole - doped libc , which was reported by wrle _",
    "et al._,@xcite should be a member of the mgb@xmath0 class of superconductors and would have an even higher t@xmath7 if it is doped to @xmath8.@xcite several other groups have now reported the undoped , semiconducting libc compound@xcite and have reported characterization by x - ray diffraction , infrared ( ir ) absorption , and raman spectroscopy .    the theoretical work since january 2001@xcite has clarified much about the cause of the high t@xmath7 in mgb@xmath0 : strongly covalent - bonding states , normally fully occupied , are driven to the fermi level ( e@xmath9 ) by the chemistry of mgb@xmath0 , and the resulting hole carriers are exceedingly strongly coupled to the bond stretching modes .",
    "this `` covalent '' coupling is what drives the critical temperature from zero ( or near ) to 40 k.",
    "the phonon energies and ep matrix elements have been obtained from linear response theory,@xcite as implemented in savrasov s full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital code.@xcite a double-@xmath10 basis was sufficient , since the atoms only have open @xmath11 and @xmath12 shells .",
    "a dense grid of q points was chosen ( a 16,16,4 grid giving 90 q points in the irreducible wedge ) . for k - space integration",
    "a finer 32,32,8 grid was used , together with an adaptive tetrahedron integration scheme .",
    "the code was used previously for mgb@xmath0 by andersen s group.@xcite these q meshes and k - point meshes were chosen to deal with fermi surface effects in the hole - doped ( hence metallic ) material , and should be more than sufficient for the semiconducting phase that we discuss here .",
    "the effects of doping on the phonon spectrum are reported elsewhere.@xcite    the frozen phonons were calculated using one of two methods . the linearized augmented plane method as implemented in the wien97 package@xcite and the full potential local orbital ( fplo ) code@xcite were used .",
    "calculational details were described previously.@xcite the masses used were , in a.m.u .",
    ": li , 6.94 ; b , 10.81 ; c , 12.01 , and the experimental lattice constants @xmath13=2.75 , @xmath14=7.058  were used .",
    "the results for all eighteen branches along high symmetry directions in the hexagonal brillouin zone are shown in fig .",
    "we concentrate here on the q=0 modes that are most accessible to experimental probes .",
    "according to the code@xcite smodes.1.2.4 that calculates the eigenmodes for an arbitrary crystal structure and q point , the @xmath15 point modes in libc ( p6@xmath16/@xmath17 , # 194 in the international tables ) decompose as 3a@xmath18 + 2b@xmath19 + 1b@xmath20 ( 6 modes ) polarized along the @xmath21 axis , and 3e@xmath20 + 2e@xmath19+e@xmath18 ( 12 modes ) polarized in the basal plane .",
    "the 2e@xmath19 modes are raman active , while ir activity involves the 2a@xmath18 and 2e@xmath20 modes.@xcite ( a different convention for designating the b@xmath22 and b@xmath19 symmetry labels was used in ref .",
    "we use the convention used by the smodes code . )",
    "we go through the modes calculated using linear response theory individually in increasing frequency ( given in @xmath4 ) .",
    "* @xmath23=0 : a@xmath18 and e@xmath20 , acoustic modes . * @xmath23=171 : e@xmath19 , b - c layers sliding against each other * @xmath23=289 : b@xmath19 , b - c layers beating against each other , motion along the @xmath21 axis * @xmath23=306 : e@xmath18 , li layers sliding against each other * @xmath23=352 : e@xmath20 , li layers sliding against the b - c layers * @xmath23=422 : a@xmath18 , li layers beating against the b - c layers , motion along the @xmath21 axis * @xmath23=540 : b@xmath20 , li layers beating against each other , motion along the @xmath21 axis * @xmath23=802 : a@xmath18 , b - c puckering mode , all b atoms move oppositely to all c atoms , li sites become inequivalent * @xmath23=821 : b@xmath19 , b - c puckering mode , b moves with c atoms above / below it , li sites remain equivalent * @xmath23=1194 : e@xmath20 , b - c bond stretching mode , the two layers are out - of - phase * @xmath23=1204 : e@xmath19 , b - c bond stretching mode , layers in phase    as expected , the lower frequency modes @xmath24 600 @xmath4 involve `` rigid '' layer displacements ( b and c displacements differ somewhat , but are parallel for these modes ) .",
    "the puckering ( b - c bond bending ) modes lie at 811@xmath2510 @xmath4 = 100 mev , and both in - phase and out - of - phase bond - stretching modes are at very high frequency ( 1200 @xmath4 = 149 mev ) .",
    "during the progress of our studies we have made various checks on the results of the linear response calculations by using the ( reliable but tedious ) frozen phonon method for selected modes .",
    "here we briefly describe these results , which serve to verify the linear response results and provide some indication of the precision of our methods .",
    "each of the methods is subject to its own numerical approximations , and hence uncertainties .",
    "for example , the frozen phonon method requires the fitting of a discrete set of e(u ) ( energy versus displacement ) values to a functional form , followed by use of the quadratic term , whereas the linear response method does not , but is more sensitive to choice of basis set , for example .",
    "symmetry lowering from the ideal p@xmath26 space group observed in raman scattering spectra@xcite suggested a puckering of the b - c rings and change of crystal symmetry to the p@xmath27 space group , which would imply an instability of the flat b - c layer to such a puckering displacement .",
    "calculation of the energy change versus displacement for this buckling mode indicated not only no instability , but a rather hard phonon with frequency of 788 @xmath4 , within 2.5% of the linear response result of 802 @xmath4 .",
    "this result is consistent with the tight - binding model of ramirez _",
    "et al._@xcite for a single b - c layer coupled to ionic charges representing the rest of the crystal , which gave a stable flat ( unpuckered ) layer . another possibility that may account for this observed symmetry lowering would be layer stacking faults ( b above b and c above c ) .",
    "such faults would provide another distinct type of li site , in much the same way that occurs for the ( proposed ) frozen puckering mode .",
    "further experimental work will be necessary to clarify this question .",
    "frozen phonon evaluations of the e@xmath19 bond - stretching mode were carried out using both the fplo and lapw codes .",
    "the results ( 1167 @xmath4 and 1145 @xmath4 , respectively ) are 4% lower than the linear response result . however , some of this discrepancy is due to neglect of coupling of this mode with the lower frequency e@xmath19 mode .",
    "( the `` frozen phonon ''",
    "we chose assumed the b and c displacement amplitudes were inversely proportional to their masses . )",
    "this neglected coupling would increase the frequency , improving agreement with the linear response value .",
    "raman active e@xmath19 modes are observed at 170 and 1176 @xmath4.@xcite the harder mode is surely the bond - stretching mode , calculated to lie at 1204 ( linear response ) and 1145 , 1167 @xmath4 by the two independent fp calculations discussed above ( which , as noted there , are known to be slight underestimates ) .",
    "thus the linear response value is too large by 2% .",
    "the 170 mode arises from the b - c `` shear '' mode ( li layers are fixed)@xcite and is indistinguishable from the calculated 171 @xmath4 .",
    "the excellent agreement for the bond - stretching mode implies that anharmonicity must be negligible for libc .",
    "several groups have calculated the harmonic frequency of the raman - active mode in mgb@xmath0 , finding results in the range 490  550 @xmath4 .",
    "the peak in the observed raman spectrum occurs at 600 @xmath4 , which has been interpreted to mean that anharmonicity of this mode in mgb@xmath0 is considerable.@xcite boeri _",
    "et al . _ have demonstrated that this anharmonicity is due to the metallic nature , and to the proximity of the fermi level to the @xmath6 band edge.@xcite hence , appreciable anharmonicity is not expected to be present in the undoped libc material .",
    "we have found , in hole - doped li@xmath1bc , that this anharmonicity again arises , and this work will be reported elsewhere .",
    "ir absorption measurements , performed with samples and geometry such that all modes are likely to be seen , identify broad but reasonably well defined peaks centered at 540 , 620 , and 1180 @xmath4 , and a shoulder in the 680 - 800 @xmath4 region that could be fit to a ir mode around 700 @xmath4.@xcite comparison of calculations with ir measurements is problematic unless the dynamical effective charges z@xmath28 are calculated , which we have not yet done .",
    "all of our calculations neglect the accompanying macroscopic electric field which gives the lo - to splitting .",
    "since the calculations agree so well with data for the raman modes , we will interpret the difference @xmath29 as the lo - to splitting for the mode , and we will only know of difficulties if this difference is negative .",
    "the observed 1180 @xmath4 mode is surely the e@xmath20 b - c bond stretching mode , calculated to lie at 1194 @xmath4 .",
    "the agreement implies that the lo - to splitting for this mode is very small ( it can not be negative , of course ) .",
    "the best identification of the experimental `` shoulder '' mode at @xmath30 @xmath4 is with the calculated a@xmath18 b - c puckering mode at 802 @xmath4 , which indicates a problem either with the identification of this shoulder with an ir - active mode , or a problem with the calculation ; further experimental study will be required to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the next lower calculated mode is the e@xmath20 li sliding mode , @xmath31 ( implying an unexpectedly large lo - to splitting of 315 @xmath4 ) , since it would imply a large z@xmath28 for the li ion . the last , and lowest , mode is the b - c layer beating mode , @xmath32 .",
    "this large lo - to splitting of 250 @xmath4 implies large z@xmath28 for the b and/or c atoms for @xmath21 axis displacement .",
    "the linear response phonon calculations are in quite close agreement with the raman scattering identifications of hlinka _ et al._@xcite seen in @xmath33 polarization .",
    "the symmetry lowering inferred from scattering in @xmath34 polarization remains unclear .",
    "comparison of the calculations with the ir microscope results of pronin _",
    "et al._@xcite for the lower frequency ir modes suggest large z@xmath28 for the li and b ( and perhaps c ) ions for @xmath21 axis displacements , while the lack of any significant lo - to splitting for the bond - stretching mode suggests negligible z@xmath28 for @xmath35 plane displacement of b and c.                  a. bharathi , s. j. balaselvi , m. premila , t. n. sairam , g. l. n. reddy , c. s. sundar , and y. hariharan , cond - mat/0207448 .",
