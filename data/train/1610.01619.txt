    "it is now widely recognized that the huge radiative energy released from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is powered by the gravitational energy of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the center of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mass of smbhs ( @xmath13 ) in quasars , that belong to the most luminous class of agns , reaches up to @xmath14 or even more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , such massive smbhs are seen even at very high redshifts , @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is totally unclear when and how those smbhs have formed and evolved . on the other hand",
    ", it has been observationally reported that there is a tight correlation between the mass of the host bulges ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this correlation suggests that the smbhs and their host galaxies have evolved with the close interplay , that is now recognized as the galaxy - smbh coevolution .",
    "therefore the observational study on the redshift evolution of smbhs is important also for understanding the total picture of the galaxy evolution , not only for understanding the evolution of smbhs themselves .    for exploring the cosmological evolution of smbhs observationally ,",
    "one important class of agns is the quasar .",
    "this is because ( i ) quasars are in the phase where smbhs are acquiring their mass via the gas accretion very actively and ( ii ) the huge luminosity of quasars enables us to measure @xmath13 through spectroscopic observations , even in the very distant universe . even without spectra ,",
    "a very rough guess of @xmath13 can be obtained through their luminosity by assuming a certain eddington ratio . in this sense , it is very interesting to investigate the number density evolution of quasars as a function of the redshift and luminosity ; i.e. , the redshift evolution of the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) .",
    "in other words , the accurate measurement of the qlf at a wide redshift range is a promising approach to study the cosmological evolution of smbhs .",
    "the qlf at @xmath17 has been extensively measured over a wide luminosity range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and accordingly it is recognized that the qlf is expressed by the broken power - law formula .",
    "though the brighter part of the qlf at @xmath18 has been also measured @xcite , the faint side of the qlf is still controversial ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once focusing on high - luminosity quasars , previous observations suggest that the number density of luminous quasars increased from the early universe to @xmath19 and then decreased to the current universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is more interesting to study possible luminosity dependences of the quasar number - density evolution ( luminosity - dependent density evolution ; ldde ) .",
    "recent optical surveys of high - redshift quasars have reported that lower - luminosity quasars show the peak of the number density at lower redshifts than higher - luminosity quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the quasar luminosity at a given eddington ratio corresponds to @xmath13 , the reported ldde trend is that is sometimes called the down - sizing evolution .",
    "such a down - sizing trend has been reported also by some x - ray surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein for theoretical works on the agn down - sizing evolution ) .",
    "note that the down - sizing evolution has been originally discussed for explaining the redshift evolution of the galaxy number density and mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the observational study on the agn down - sizing evolution is exciting also for exploring the galaxy - smbh co - evolution .",
    "one caveat in the previous study on the agn down - sizing evolution is that the number density of low - luminosity quasars at high redshifts is quite uncertain , that prevents us from understanding the total picture of the quasar ldde .",
    "@xcite mentioned that the number ratio of low - luminosity quasars to high - luminosity quasars is possibly higher at @xmath20 ( `` up - down sizing '' ; see also @xcite ) , but such detailed studies on the quasar ldde at high redshifts required more statistically reliable qlfs with a wide luminosity range . here",
    "we point out two issues that may introduce large systematic errors in the previous qlf studies .",
    "one is the effect of the luminosity dependence of quasar spectra on the completeness in quasar surveys .",
    "the survey completeness is usually estimated by adopting a typical template of the quasar spectrum , constructed empirically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or based on simple models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however the equivalent width ( @xmath21 ) of broad emission lines in the quasar spectrum strongly depends on the quasar luminosity , in the sense that lower - luminosity quasars show emission lines with a larger @xmath21 ( the baldwin effect ; @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein for the luminosity dependence of flux ratios of quasar broad lines ) .",
    "if the quasar luminosity investigated in a survey is much lower than that used for the template in the completeness , the quasar colors calculated from the template may be systematically different from the actual quasar colors due to the unexpected contribution of emission - line fluxes into broad - band magnitudes .",
    "therefore it is essential to know how the baldwin effect affects the completeness in quasar surveys and the resultant qlfs .",
    "another possible source of systematic errors in the qlf study is the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) attenuation by neutral hydrogen , that is also important in the completeness estimate because the color of high - redshift quasars is sensitive to the igm absorption .",
    "recently @xcite pointed out that the previous models of the igm attenuation ( such as the model by @xcite ) tend to overestimate the optical depth of the igm .",
    "thus it is important to examine how the derived qlf is different from the previous estimate when we adopt the recent igm model by @xcite that is more consistent with recent observational data of quasar absorption - line systems .    in this paper , we investigate how the baldwin effect and the igm models affect the quasar colors , completeness estimates , and the resultant qlfs , specifically focusing on quasars at @xmath22 . based on the obtained results , we revisit the redshift evolution of the quasar space density in a wide luminosity range to examine the quasar ldde .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we describe how the quasar color is affected by the baldwin effect and the adopted igm model . in section  [ sec:3 ] and section  [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we show the resultant survey completeness and the qlf for @xmath23 and 5 .",
    "finally we present the summary of this paper in section  [ sec:5 ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath24cdm cosmology with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the hubble constant of @xmath27 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "for examining how the baldwin effect affects the quasar colors , the @xmath21 of emission lines should be known as a function of the quasar luminosity . to measure the @xmath21",
    ", we focus on the archival data of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and investigate the spectra of quasars in the boss quasar catalog @xcite in the data release 9 ( dr9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the boss observations , two double - armed spectrographs , which are upgraded and",
    "cover a wider spectral range than those used by the former sdss observations , are used @xcite .",
    "furthermore the boss targeted quasars with @xmath8 2 magnitudes fainter than the original sdss spectroscopic targets , i.e. , @xmath28 or @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this wide magnitude range of the quasar sample is useful for our analysis of the baldwin effect .",
    "the spectral resolution varies from @xmath30 @xmath8 1,300 at 3600@xmath31 to @xmath8 2,500 at 10000@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this resolution is enough for our analysis , since the broad emission lines in quasars have a large velocity width typically ( @xmath32 1,000 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the total area covered by the dr9 is 3,275 deg@xmath33 , in which 87,822 spectroscopically confirmed quasars are identified @xcite . in order to cover most strong rest - frame uv emission lines such as ly@xmath34 and c  iv ,",
    "we specifically focus on the redshift range of @xmath35 where 65,419 quasars are listed in the catalog of @xcite . among them , quasars showing broad abosrption - line ( bal ) features in their spectra ( 6,449 objects , that are identified through the ` bal`@xmath36`flag ` parameter in the catalog of @xcite ) are removed because we can not measure the @xmath21 correctly in those cases .",
    "then we select objects whose redshift is accurately measured , by adopting the criteria of ` zwarning ` flag @xmath37 and ` err`_`zpipe ` @xmath38 ( 52,290 objects ) .",
    "an additional criterion is also adopted for avoiding the mis - identification of emission lines ( and consequently the wrong redshift ) , by comparing the redshift measured through the sdss pipeline ( ` z`_`pipe ` ) and that measured through the visual inspection ( ` z`_`vi ` ) . in this step ,",

    "* ) , because in this luminosity range there are enough number of quasars for each luminosity . finally , we remove three quasars whose fits header has a problem .",
    "the number of finally selected boss quasars in our analysis is 43,953 .      to investigate the relation between the quasar luminosity and @xmath21 of broad emission lines in the quasar spectrum statistically ,",
    "we analyze composite spectra of boss quasars for each luminosity .",
    "this stacking analysis is a powerful method for studying the luminosity dependence of quasar spectral features , since it minimizes the dispersion of spectral features in quasar spectra in each luminosity bin .",
    "another advantage of the stacking analysis is measuring the spectral features of low - luminosity quasars whose individual spectra show very faint spectral features with very low signal - to - noise ratios ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "first , we confirm that @xmath46(c  iv ) of boss quasars does not depend on redshift , that is consistent with earlier works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* see appendix ) .",
    "therefore we combine the spectra of quasars in the whole redshift range of @xmath47 to make the composite spectra as a function of the absolute magnitude .",
    "this enables us to examine the luminosity dependence in a wide luminosity range , because quasars at higher redshift and those at lower redshift trace the higher luminosity and lower luminosity ranges , respectively .",

    "we then convert each spectrum from the observed frame to the rest frame , and then normalize the each converted spectrum by averaging the flux at 1445@xmath31 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath49 1485@xmath31 , which contains few emission - lines contributions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however at @xmath74 , the estimated completeness in this work is lower than that estimated by @xcite .",
    "this is because the new extinction model @xcite makes the completeness lower especially at @xmath74 , whose effect gives stronger impact on the completeness estimate than the effect of the luminosity dependence of the quasar spectrum .",
    "based on the revised completeness for the previous quasar survey through the optical color selection at the cosmos field @xcite , we revisit the qlf at @xmath98 .",
    "first we compute the effective comoving volume of the cosmos quasar survey as @xmath112 where @xmath113 ( 1.64 deg@xmath33 ) is the solid angle of the survey and @xmath114 is the photometric completeness studied in section  [ subsec:3.2 ] . in @xcite ,",
    "eight spectroscopically - confirmed quasars in the cosmos field are used to derive the qlf at @xmath23 .",
    "taking into account of the possibility that some of quasar photometric candidates without spectra could also be quasars ( that is estimated based on the success rate of the spectroscopic run ) , we statistically adopt the number of quasars in the cosmos survey at @xmath23 as follows ; 4.67 for @xmath115 and 6.06 for @xmath116 , respectively @xcite . by using these corrected numbers of quasars and the effective comoving volume ,",
    "we calculate the space density of quasar and their standard deviation as @xmath117 @xmath118^{1/2 } = [ n_{\\rm{cor}}(\\frac{1}{v_{\\rm{eff}}})^2]^{1/2 } ,       \\label{equ10}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the corrected number of quasars .",
    "the calculated space density of quasar and their standard deviation are @xmath121 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath115 and @xmath122 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the corrected number and calculated space density of @xmath23 quasars in cosmos are showed in table  [ tbl-2 ] , and the obtained qlf is plotted in figure  [ fig8 ] with the results of @xcite and sdss @xcite .",
    "although the redshift range of sdss data ( @xmath123 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is slightly different from our study ( @xmath124 ) , we apply the weighted least - squares fit to the space density of quasars at @xmath23 inferred by both our study and sdss . here",
    "the following double power - law function is adopted : @xmath125 where @xmath34 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are the bright - end slope , the faint - end slope , the normalization of the luminosity function , and the characteristic absolute magnitude , respectively @xcite . among the four parameters , the bright - end slope is fixed to be @xmath129 based on the sdss result at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since the characteristic absolute magnitude becomes too bright when the parameter is treated as a free parameter in the fit , the characteristic magnitude is fixed to be @xmath130 based on the result of the cosmos qlf at @xmath23 @xcite . the best - fit values and 1@xmath131 standard deviations of @xmath127 and @xmath126",

    "this is attributed by the revision of the completeness estimate and the adopted latest igm absorption model from the previous work @xcite .",

    "as described in section  [ sec:1 ] , the number density of low - luminosity quasars at high redshifts is the key to interpret the ldde of quasars and to discuss the cosmological evolution of smbhs for different masses .",

    "* ) , and sdss @xcite are plotted .",
    "the data at @xmath155 is totally consistent with the agn down - sizing evolutionary picture , as pointed out in some earlier works @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "various results of the low - luminosity quasar space density are suggested at @xmath20 .",
    "the result of our study and @xcite which used the cosmos field suggest that the low - luminosity quasar space density decrease from @xmath19 to @xmath74 . this trend is suggested also by recent x - ray surveys of high-@xmath12 low - luminosity quasars @xcite , not only by previous x - ray surveys of relatively bright quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however the result of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ) and the deep lens survey ( dls ) by @xcite suggest constant or higher number densities of low - luminosity quasars at @xmath23 than that at @xmath156 . at @xmath157 , recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggested lower number density of quasar than our upper limits of them at @xmath74 .",
    "our result shows that the evolution of low - luminosity quasar number density at @xmath98 is consistent with the agn downsizing , even if we take into account of the baldwin effect and the latest extinction model of @xcite for intergalactic absorption in the estimation of the photometric completeness .",
    "however , the suggested number density of low - luminosity quasars at @xmath23 differs between the cosmos field and the dls / ndwfs fields .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy is the criterion of the point - source selection , that is not discussed in our work .",
    "specifically , the dls / ndwfs survey defines the point source based on ground - based @xmath30-band images ( see figure 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the cosmos survey defines the point source based on the hst images @xcite .",
    "another possible reason for the discrepancy in the number density of high-@xmath12 low - luminosity quasars in previous surveys is the small sample size of their spectroscopically - confirmed quasars . to clarify the reason for this difference and understand the evolution of the quasar number density more accurately , further observations of low - luminosity quasars in a wider survey area are crucial .    as shown in sections  [ subsec:4.1 ] and [ subsec:4.2 ] , the inferred number density of high - redshift low - luminosity quasars was overestimated or underestimated by a factor of @xmath158% compared with the result of @xcite , depending on their redshift and luminosity .",
    "this suggests that there was a systematic error caused by the adopted igm extinction model and the luminosity dependence of quasar spectral template ( i.e. , the baldwin effect ) in the quasar number density reported in the previous surveys . note",
    "that this systematic error is not seriously large if it is compared with the statistical error in the cosmos works @xcite , because of the small number of photometric and spectroscopic sample of high-@xmath12 low - luminosity quasars .",
    "however , near - future surveys of high-@xmath12 low - luminosity quasars such as subaru / hyper suprime - cam ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) and subaru / prime focus spectrograph @xcite will observe a numerous number of high-@xmath12 low - luminosity quasars . in those surveys , systematic errors with a factor of @xmath158% is not negligible at all given their small statistical error .",
    "therefore , understanding the proper method to infer the survey completeness and effective volume as investigated in this work is crucial .",
    "in order to derive the high-@xmath12 low - luminosity qlf accurately , we quantify the influence of the baldwin effect and the igm absorption model on the quasar color .",
    "we then revaluate the photometric completeness of low - luminosity quasar surveys with cosmos images .",
    "the main results of this study are as follows .    1 .   at @xmath98 ,",
    "lower - luminosity quasars are more easily selected by color selection criteria than higher - luminosity quasars when the effects of the baldwin effect are properly considered .",
    "2 .   by comparing the quasar model spectra adopting the extinction model by @xcite with the other model by @xcite , we find that the former ( latest ) model predicts a smaller lyman - break feature at @xmath98 , that makes the color selection of quasars more challenging .",
    "3 .   the revised completeness is larger at @xmath23 but smaller at @xmath74 than our previous works @xcite , due to the effects of the baldwin effect and igm model .",
    "the revaluated quasar space densities at @xmath23 are @xmath121 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath115 and @xmath122 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "these densities are lower than the results without considering the baldwin effect @xcite .",
    "therefore the revaluated faint - end slope of our qlf , @xmath126 @xmath159 , is flatter than that of @xcite .",
    "the upper limits of the quasar space density at @xmath74 are @xmath145 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath148 .",
    "these densities are higher than the results without considering the baldwin effect .",

    "<S> recent studies have derived quasar luminosity functions ( qlfs ) at various redshifts . however , the faint side of the qlf at high redshifts is still too uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> an accurate estimate of the survey completeness is essential to derive an accurate qlf for use in studying the luminosity - dependent density evolution of the quasar population . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate how the luminosity dependence of quasar spectra ( the baldwin effect ) and the attenuation model for the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) affect the completeness estimates . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we revisit the completeness of quasar surveys specifically at @xmath0 , using the cosmos images observed with subaru / suprime - cam . as the result , we find that the completeness estimates are sensitive to the luminosity dependence of the quasar spectrum and difference in the igm attenuation models . at @xmath1 , the number density of quasars </S>",
    "<S> when we adopt the latest igm model and take the luminosity dependence of spectra into account are @xmath2 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 mpc@xmath3 mag@xmath4 for @xmath7 , respectively , which are @xmath824% lower than that estimated by the conventional method . on the other hand , at @xmath9 , a @xmath10 confidence upper limit of the number density at @xmath11 in our new estimates </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath843% higher than that estimated previously . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the luminosity dependence of the quasar spectrum and the igm model are important for deriving accurate number density of high-@xmath12 quasars . </S>",
    "<S> even taking these effects into account , the inferred luminosity - dependent density evolution of quasars is consistent with the agn down - sizing evolutionary picture . </S>"
