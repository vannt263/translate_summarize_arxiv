    "it is a fundamental problem in information science what is the most efficient way of transmitting information with a minimum of transmission resources .",
    "the amount of information transmissible through a communications channel is determined by the noise characteristics of the channel and by the quantities of available transmission resources . in classical communication theory @xcite",
    ", the amount of transmissible information can be increased twice at most when the transmission resource ( e.g. the code length , the signal power , the bandwidth ) is doubled , for the fixed noise characteristics of the channel . in quantum communication theory , however , this is not true in general , that is , the amount of information transmitted can be increased even more than twice .",
    "this feature is called the _",
    "superadditivity _ of the capacity of quantum channel @xcite .",
    "the superadditivity becomes essential in any transmission of signals at the quantum level where ambiguity among signals is a matter of non - commutativity of the density matrices , i.e. @xmath0 , rather than any classical noises such as thermal noise .",
    "one typical example is deep space optical communications .",
    "inter - satellite optical link is expected to achieve a high transmission rate that can not be achieved by the radio- or micro - wave links , e.g. to realize data transmission from a space - telescope with billion pixels or real time communications over the planets . in a deep space",
    "optical link , the sender prepares coherent state signals with as large amplitude as possible allowed by a limited power supply .",
    "such signals are , however , extremely weakened at the receiving end , typically less than a few photons per pulse , due to the beam divergence and energy loss .",
    "since the energy quantum of carriers is greater than that of thermal noise in optical domain , i.e. @xmath1 , physical states of carriers can be described by pure quantum states in good approximation .",
    "for example , the binary phase shift keyed signals to convey classical letters 0 and 1 , respectively , are represented by the coherent states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . for weak coherent pulses ,",
    "the state overlap @xmath4 becomes non - negligible , i.e. @xmath5 and @xmath6 are noncommuting .",
    "according to the uncertainty principle , noncommuting density matrices can never be distinguished perfectly .",
    "this imposes an inevitable error in signal detection even in an ideal communications system @xcite .",
    "actually , when @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can not be distinguished at a bit error rate less than @xmath10 , which is a typical error free criterion in deep space communications .    historically , an extension of communication theory into quantum domain including this aspect of ambiguity has been explored since 1960 s @xcite . in 1973 , holevo derived the quantity that bounds the upper limit of the capacity of a quantum communications channel @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that this so - called holevo bound is an achievable rate , that is , the exact expression of the capacity @xcite .",
    "classical communication theory @xcite describes the special case where the signals are given by commuting density matrices .",
    "the distinctive characteristics of quantum theory of capacity is the great emphasis on quantum decoding process to extract information from block sequences of noncommuting density matrices .",
    "the essence of the optimal decoding is the use of a process of entangling letter states constituting code words prior to measurement to enhance the distinguishability of signals .",
    "such a process is a quantum computation on code word states .",
    "this so - called quantum collective decoding is a new aspect , not found in conventional coding techniques , and leads to a larger capacity .",
    "this is called the _ superadditive quantum coding gain _ ( sqcg ) @xcite in a quantum channel since the length @xmath11 quantum coding makes capacity more than @xmath11 times larger from the capacity achievable only by conventional coding .",
    "taking it into account , the capacity is defined as the maximum rate of the mutual information for a ( quantum ) code of length @xmath11 divided by the length @xmath11 in the limit of @xmath12 for asymptotic error free transmission .",
    "the theory of capacity , however , generally gives no guidance on how to construct codes that approach the capacity .",
    "a practical problem is then to find good codes to attain a large sqcg in a small block length",
    ". this must be an important issue in any communications and information - processing systems when they work at the quantum level , which is expected in a few decades considering recent exponential growth of info - communication demands .",
    "however , little attention has been paid to this topic so far .",
    "only several coding schemes have been proposed to exhibit sqcg @xcite and the first experimental demonstration has recently been reported by the authors @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give detailed information that was abbreviated or omitted in our previous letter . an attention is particularly paid to describe the strategy how to implement the quantum measurements used in our experiments by logical and physical quantum circuits .",
    "we also describe the detailed discussion of the implications of sqcg in small code length on practical communication performances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ capacities ] , we remind readers of several capacities of quantum channels studied to date , and explain our scenario . in sec .",
    "[ supaddcodinggain ] , the basic notion for capacity theorem and sqcg are briefly explained . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we discuss how we designed logical and physical quantum circuits for our sqcg experiment , which was omitted in our previous letter .",
    "section [ implementation ] describes in detail our experiment of sqcg reported in ref .",
    "we also show the experimental results about the separable quantum measurements attaining the single  shot capacity and the accessible information for comparison . in sec .",
    "[ qchc ] , we discuss how sqcg , even the small gain demonstrated in length two coding , can boost a communication performance attained by conventional coding technique .",
    "the idea is based on _ quantum - classical hybrid coding _ ( qchc ) which was briefly mentioned in our previous letter @xcite .",
    "theoretical details on the methodology of qchc are given .",
    "section [ concluding ] is for concluding remarks .",
    "since shannon s capacity theory was extended into generic quantum states in refs .",
    "@xcite , the capacity theory is further extended to include new auxiliary resources of entangled particles , new quantum protocols , and a new object to be transmitted , i.e. intact quantum state @xcite .",
    "the notion of the capacity for quantum channels is now classified into two categories ; 1 ) the classical capacity for transmitting conventional ( classical ) alphabet , and 2 ) the quantum capacity for transmitting quantum alphabet ( unknown quantum states ) .",
    "for both categories entanglement assisted protocols may be considered , namely superdense coding @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite , respectively .",
    "our concern is the first category , i.e. the _ classical _ capacity .",
    "depending on whether additional entanglement resources are brought into play or not , the classical capacity is classified into two kinds , namely , the entanglement - assisted capacity @xmath13 and the ordinary capacity @xmath14 .",
    "the former is defined for a quantum channel with the help of unlimited prior entanglement sharing between the sender and the receiver @xcite .",
    "the latter is defined for a quantum channel with the help of any allowed quantum operations at the sender ( quantum encoding ) and the receiver ( quantum decoding ) , but _ without _ any prior source sharing .",
    "both schemes assume multiple uses of the channel , that is , coding , and the capacity is defined as the maximum amount of transmissible information per channel use .",
    "it should be noted that shared entanglement is not regarded as the transmission resources in the definition of the entanglement - assisted capacity @xmath13 .",
    "this type of classification can simplify the study of several distinct capacities and their relation including the quantum capacities @xcite .    from a practical point of view , on the other hand , it is not realistic to expect the assistance of _ unlimited _ external resources . to predict the highest transmission rate in realistic situations , all the physical entities used for transmission , such as the shared entanglement ,",
    "must be included in the elements constituting a communications channel . in this situation ,",
    "the ordinary capacity @xmath14 is appropriate to evaluate the communication performance of the channel since it imposes the power constraint condition of the _ total _ physical resources .",
    "keeping such backgrounds in mind , we restrict our discussion to the following protocol .",
    "the sender transmits classical alphabet in classically encoded format , i.e. in separable tensor product states ( code word states ) made of a given set of _ letter states _ , and these code word states are still separable at the receiving end .",
    "no prior entanglement is shared between the sender and the receiver .",
    "the receiver may apply any quantum operations to the received code word states .",
    "in fact , it is known that effective quantum coding is that the receiver entangles the letter states prior to detection .",
    "this is called quantum decoding and contributes to sqcg which is never observed in any classical coding .",
    "such scenario is within the framework of the ordinary capacity @xmath14 , and exactly the case that the capacity theories of refs .",
    "@xcite concern .",
    "the reasons for choosing such protocol and for excluding quantum encoding and prior entanglement sharing are 1 ) concrete quantum coding schemes are known only for such protocol at present , and 2 ) it fits better to practical motivations introduced in sec .  [ introduction ] since it does not necessarily require a transmission of nonclassical state signals .",
    "the main task in this paper is , therefore , the demonstration of the quantum decoding process .",
    "a practical mean for effective communications is coding , that is , representing alphabet by sequences of simple letters such as @xmath15 .",
    "alphabets to be transmitted are represented by code words which are sequences of a given set of letters @xmath16 such as the binary set @xmath15 .",
    "the transmitter modulates a signal carrier into one of @xmath17 states @xmath18 according to the input letter .",
    "if the letter states @xmath18 appear as orthogonal states at the receiving end , then they can be distinguished perfectly and @xmath19 bits of information , which is the maximum shannon entropy of the set @xmath16 , can be faithfully retrieved per letter .",
    "this is , however , not the case in general .",
    "a channel is usually subject to various types of noise disturbances . in order to transmit information reliably through a channel with finite errors",
    ", one must introduce some redundancy in code word representation prior to transmission so as to allow the correction of errors at the receiving side .",
    "this entails adding some redundant letters to the code words and hence increases their length .",
    "channel coding_.    first , the source encoder converts the original message into a sequence of the letters in the given set @xmath16 , and then the channel encoder divides it into blocks of length @xmath20 ( _ message blocks _ ) . each block is supplemented by an additional block ( _ redundant block _ ) of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) letters to compose a channel code word @xmath23 : @xmath24 note that although there are @xmath25 possible sequences of length  @xmath11 in total , only part of them , i.e.  @xmath26 sequences , are used as code words .",
    "this redundancy , together with appropriate encoding and decoding , allows us to recover possible errors in transmission .",

    "the transmission rate is then defined by @xmath28 bits / letter . for a channel with a capacity @xmath14 bits / letter , it is possible @xcite within the rate @xmath29 to reproduce the @xmath30 bits of messages with an error probability as small as desired by appropriate encoding and decoding in the limit @xmath12 .    a mathematical model of a channel",

    "the capacity ( for a memoryless channel ) is defined as the maximum mutual information with respect to the prior distribution of the letters @xmath35 , @xmath43    in the quantum context , however , only the input variable @xmath44 and the corresponding set of quantum states at the receiver s hand denoted as @xmath45 are given .",

    "when the measurement is made by projection onto separable bases , such a memory effect never takes place .",
    "projection onto appropriate entangled bases induces quantum interferences among the code word states to reduce the ambiguity among the signals .",
    "the memory effect is a direct consequence of this quantum interference of block codes , that is , exactly the effect of the entanglement .",
