    "during the last decades the theoretical investigation of strongly correlated electron systems concentrated on the one - band hubbard model  @xcite , which serves as the standard model for electrons with strong short - range interactions ; for a recent review , see  @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model was originally proposed for the description of 3@xmath0  electrons in transition metals to explain ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism in iron and nickel and their oxides  @xcite . for these substances the band degeneracy and",
    "intra - atomic ( hund s rule ) exchange couplings apparently play an important role and , consequently , multi - band hubbard models need to be investigated .    until recently ,",
    "band degeneracies were considered mostly for immobile @xmath1  electrons which hybridize with featureless conduction electrons .",
    "the corresponding single - impurity anderson model  @xcite and its periodic generalization ( varma  yafet model  @xcite ) apply , e.g. , for the rare - earth materials .",
    "since the coulomb interaction between the @xmath1  electrons is very large , one often encounters the situation where the @xmath2-fold degenerate levels are at most singly occupied .",
    "hence , the issue of degenerate bands with finite electron density need not be addressed in these cases .    in the past few years",
    "the multi - band hubbard model received new attention .",
    "the gutzwiller approximation to gutzwiller - correlated variational wave functions was generalized in  @xcite@xcite , the slave boson mean - field approach along the lines of kotliar and ruckenstein  @xcite was developed and used in  @xcite@xcite , and dynamical mean - field methods were applied in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the method in  @xcite to evaluate general gutzwiller - correlated wave functions in the limit of infinite space dimensions without further approximations . in this way",
    "we recover the results of  @xcite@xcite and thus show that these earlier results become exact in infinite dimensions within the variational approach .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the slave boson mean - field results are variationally controlled at zero temperature in this limit .",
    "similar results hold for the one - band hubbard model ; see  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ? * chap .  3.4 ,  3.5 ) for brief reviews .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ wave_functions ]",
    "we introduce a general class of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions which allows for the variational study of hubbard models with general spin - orbit structure .",
    "we set up a diagrammatic perturbation theory to calculate expectation values for the variational ground - state energy and other physical quantities of interest . in section  [ exact_results ]",
    "we use our formalism to derive exact analytical expressions for the ground - state energy in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions . in section [ compareit ]",
    "we compare them to the results of approximate treatments of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions and those of the slave boson mean - field theory .",
    "since our treatment allows for the inclusion of site - diagonal energetic disorder in the hamiltonian , we briefly discuss the consequences of strong correlations on the anderson transition within our variational description .",
    "a summary in section  [ summary ] closes our presentation .",
    "in this section we introduce the hubbard hamiltonian for degenerate bands and the class of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions as our approximate ground states .",
    "the minimization of the ground - state energy fixes the variational parameters contained in these trial states .",
    "for the evaluation of the corresponding many - body expectation values we develop a diagrammatic formalism which allows for the complete solution of the problem in infinite space dimensions .      in his first two papers on narrow - band electron systems",
    "hubbard  @xcite considered 3@xmath0  electrons with a purely local interaction . to simplify our considerations",
    "we make the further assumption that the interaction depends only on the number densities of electrons in the @xmath0  orbitals",
    ". then we may write the hamiltonian in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are combined spin - orbit indices ( @xmath5 for @xmath0  electrons ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote lattice sites , and @xmath8 is the matrix element for the electron transfer between two sites  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 with spin - orbit indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . in the following we will use the notion `` orbital '' for spin - orbital states .",
    "the local energies  @xmath11 can be arbitrarily chosen to describe different orbital energy levels , e.g. , in compounds or to mimic the influence of impurities and other lattice defects .",
    "as we will show below , expectation values for gutzwiller - correlated wave functions can be calculated analytically in infinite dimensions even in the presence of energetically random impurity potentials .",
    "finally , @xmath12 describes the local coulomb interaction between two electrons in the orbitals  @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the same lattice site .",
    "the local interaction partly accounts for the atomic exchange coupling .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath13 the ground state of an atom with two electrons should be a spin triplet according to hund s first rule .",
    "according to our hamiltonian  ( [ 1 ] ) the interaction energy of the local @xmath14 states is different from that of the @xmath15 states .",
    "however , the two @xmath15 states are still energetically degenerate in  ( [ 1 ] ) , i.e. , the interaction does not fully distinguish between triplet and singlet states , as required by hund s first rule . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to density - dependent terms only",
    ". this should be the generic case for c@xmath16 and other fullerenes for which exchange coupling is less important because of the large diameter of the molecules ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "for other materials it might be necessary to include local spin - flip terms both in the hamiltonian and in the variational description . since the evaluation of many - body wave functions",
    "is fairly complicated we restrict ourselves to gutzwiller correlators which are solely dependent on the density operators [ see  ( [ 5 ] ) below ] , and also omit the spin - flip terms in the hamiltonian for consistency .",
    "we introduce the following notations for the @xmath17 possible configurations of a given lattice site .    1 .",
    "an atomic configuration  @xmath18 is characterized by the electron occupation of the orbitals , @xmath19 where the order of numbers in @xmath20 is irrelevant .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 in  ( [ 2 ] ) means that the site is empty . in general",
    ", we interpret the indices  @xmath18 in  ( [ 2 ] ) as sets in the usual sense .",
    "for example , in the atomic configuration @xmath22 only those orbitals in  @xmath18 are occupied which are not in  @xmath23 .",
    "the complement of  @xmath18 is @xmath24 , i.e. , in the atomic configuration @xmath25 all orbitals but those in  @xmath18 are occupied .",
    "the absolute value @xmath26 of a configuration is the number of elements in it , i.e. , @xmath27 3 .",
    "the operator which projects onto a specific configuration  @xmath18 on site  @xmath6 is given by + [ g1 ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the expectation value in the gutzwiller - correlated wave function ; see below .",
    "the operators  @xmath30 measure the `` net '' occupancy .",
    "besides these we define the operators for the `` gross '' occupancy as @xmath31 + the gross occupancy operator @xmath32 gives a non - zero result when applied to  @xmath23 only if  @xmath18 contains electrons in the same orbitals as  @xmath23 .",
    "however , @xmath18 and @xmath23 need not be identical because @xmath23 could contain additional electrons in further orbitals , i.e. , only @xmath33 is required .",

    "as shown in more detail in  @xcite we have to carry out the following program : ( i )  choose the appropriate expansion parameters , ( ii )  apply wick s theorem , and ( iii )  use the linked - cluster theorem .",

    "in this section we compare our results to those of related work , namely the gutzwiller approximation and the slave boson mean - field approach , which are seen to become variational controlled in infinite dimensions .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the applicability of the variational approach to the anderson transition in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "for the one - band case it is known that the results of the gutzwiller approximation for the gutzwiller wave function become exact in infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the variational calculation of correlation functions is straightforward in infinite dimensions  @xcite , whereas their consistent treatment is beyond the gutzwiller approximation scheme .",
    "generalizations of the gutzwiller approximation to other situations than the translationally invariant , paramagnetic one - band gutzwiller wave function encounter two conceptual difficulties .",
    "( i )  it is not clear from the beginning whether the generalized gutzwiller approximations in  @xcite@xcite lead to physically acceptable results in the whole parameter space .",
    "for example , early extensions of the gutzwiller approximation to the case of antiferromagnetism gave rise to negative occupation densities  @xcite .",
    "( ii )  the gutzwiller approximation may give the correct results in infinite dimensions but the corresponding wave function could not be identified properly . for example , in a recent treatment okabe  @xcite found the correct expression for the ground - state energy  ( [ 49 ] ) in infinite dimensions for the translationally invariant case but he did not specify the corresponding gutzwiller wave function . therefore , his results could not be tested against numerical approaches .",
    "in contrast , the wave function  ( [ 5 ] ) provides a solid starting point for variational monte - carlo simulations .",
    "hence , an assessment of the quality of the gutzwiller approximation for finite dimensions can now be performed ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite for applications to the one - band case .",
    "the proper choice of the wave function  ( [ 5 ] ) was essential for its approximation - free evaluation in infinite dimensions . in our definition of generalized gutzwiller - correlated wave functions _ each _ multiple occupancy of a lattice site is controlled by its own variational parameter .",
    "equations  ( [ 39 ] ) show that we may then replace these variational parameters by their physical counterparts , the net multiple occupancies  @xmath146 .",
    "in contrast , the trial state of chao and gutzwiller  @xcite and chao  @xcite only includes variational parameters for the gross occupancies @xmath164 for @xmath165 , @xmath166 where we used our notation . in their evaluation the `` maximum term conditions '' of the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite",
    "also lead to a set of @xmath60 equations similar to  ( [ 39 ] ) but it can not be solved explicitly because there are only @xmath167 variational parameters @xmath142 @xmath168 in  ( [ 50 ] ) . to make progress chao set to zero all terms with multiple occupancies @xmath169 , an assumption not warranted by the wave function  ( [ 50 ] ) .",
    "if we ( artificially ) put @xmath170 for @xmath169 for our wave function  ( [ 5 ] ) we recover chao s results .",
    "hence , chao s results do apply to the gutzwiller - correlated wave function  ( [ 5 ] ) in a special limit .",
    "similarly , the results of lu  @xcite are found to be correct if his further assumptions are adopted .",
    "he used site and orbital - independent coulomb interactions , @xmath171 , and assumed that some of the multiple occupancies vanish identically . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the latter assumption might not hold close to the brinkman",
    " rice transition on the metallic side .    the proper form of the wave function for arbitrary band degeneracies  ( [ 5 ] ) was first given by bnemann and weber  @xcite for translationally invariant systems  ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "using the gutzwiller approximation they derived the equations  ( [ 39 ] ) ,  ( [ 48 ] ) , and  ( [ 49 ] ) . in this work we showed that their results become exact in infinite dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly covered all cases of symmetry breaking in the one - particle product wave functions  @xmath51 ; the cases of spin and orbital ordering in materials with degenerate bands can equally be studied with the help of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions .      for the one - band case the slave boson mean - field theory  @xcite ,  @xcite@xcite yields the same results as gutzwiller - correlated variational wave functions in infinite dimensions , including the cases of broken symmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the slave boson approach is variationally controlled at zero temperature in this limit . the slave boson saddle - point",
    "free energy can be re - derived from a `` variational partition function ''  @xcite .",
    "this construction shows that , at best , the slave boson mean - field theory is applicable up to excitation energies for which fermi - liquid theory is valid . since fermi - liquid parameters can be derived from the variational ground - state energy  @xcite , the low - energy properties can equally well be described with the variational and the slave boson mean - field approach .",
    "recently , the slave boson mean - field theory for degenerate hubbard models was worked out by hasegawa  @xcite who used the extension of the kotliar ",
    "ruckenstein approach for the degenerate anderson model by dorin and schlottmann  @xcite .",
    "his results for @xmath13 completely agree with ours and , thus , the above statements on the virtues and limitations of the slave boson mean - field approach also apply for the case of degenerate bands . independently , frsard and kotliar  @xcite derived a set of slave boson mean - field equations and , as an application , reproduced lu s results on the mott transition  @xcite .",
    "our approach also covers the case of local , energetically random impurity potentials  @xmath173 . for illustrative purposes we restrict ourselves to @xmath94 , @xmath174 , and no spin - flip hopping . in this case",
    "the system is a mott insulator at half band - filling , @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the doping degree of the lower hubbard band  @xcite . in this case",
    "the variational ground - state energy becomes    [ gslok ] @xmath177    recall that the local occupation densities @xmath178 are given by @xmath179 ) in terms of a two - fluid picture which naturally arises for strongly correlated disordered electron systems .",
    "a recent introduction and overview on the theory of the anderson transition in interacting electron systems is given in  @xcite .",
    "( i )  a certain fraction of electrons may localize , e.g. , a @xmath9  electron is localized on site  @xmath101 in @xmath51 , @xmath180 . from the expectation value for the ground - state energy  ( [ gslok ] ) it follows that the probability is zero that the electron hops off the site  @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , a @xmath181  electron will not hop onto this site because this is dynamically forbidden , @xmath182 . within our variational description",
    "the occupation of site  @xmath101 does not change .",
    "the site  @xmath101 is equally likely occupied by a @xmath9 or a @xmath181  electron and , therefore , the site contributes to a curie - like susceptibility .",
    "( ii )  the excluded sites represent an unretarded ( random ) hard - core potential for the remaining electrons besides the fluctuating local potentials  @xmath183 and the dynamical constraint of no double occupancy .",
    "the strength of the impurity potentials  @xmath183 and the degree of doping determine the fraction of `` localized '' and `` mobile '' electrons .",
    "for a small doping of the lower hubbard band , @xmath184 , even the `` mobile '' fraction of the electrons can not carry dc  current since their wave functions do not spread over macroscopic distances .",
    "the doping has to exceed some `` percolation threshold '' to guarantee a finite dc  conductivity . above the critical doping for",
    "the anderson transition  @xmath185 one should observe a metallic conductivity at zero temperature but the magnetic signatures of the localized fraction of the electrons ( `` local moments '' ) should remain .",
    "it requires further doping beyond  @xmath185 to destroy the curie behavior of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "qualitatively similar results are found by dobrosavljevi and kotliar  @xcite .",
    "they used the dynamical mean - field theory approach and approximated the remaining local - impurity problem with the help of the slave boson mean - field approach of barnes , coleman , and read and newns  @xcite@xcite .",
    "they also address the strong - coupling limit and find that local moments form in the metallic phase before the anderson transition takes place . in their case the strength of the impurity potentials is varied for fixed doping . in both cases",
    "the position of the mobility edge is varied with respect to the fermi energy , and the physics should qualitatively be the same .",
    "it should be clear , though , that our variational approach gives only a rather crude description for the local moment formation and the anderson transition in the lower hubbard band .",
    "in this work we introduced a general class of gutzwiller - correlated wave functions for multi - band hubbard models .",
    "in contrast to earlier generalizations of the original gutzwiller wave function  @xcite to the case of degenerate bands  @xcite we introduced independent variational parameters for each multiple occupancy of a lattice site . only in this most general form",
    "each of the original variational parameters @xmath40 can be expressed by the net occupancy densities @xmath163 which give the average probability that configuration  @xmath18 is present on site  @xmath6 .",
    "we developed a diagrammatic formalism which allows the approximation - free evaluation of our general gutzwiller - correlated wave functions in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "our analytical results reproduce recent results within the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite@xcite and extend these to the case of a broken symmetry .",
    "in addition , the slave boson mean - field theory  @xcite@xcite becomes variationally controlled at zero temperature in the limit of infinite dimensions . as can be inferred from the single - band case ,",
    "the slave boson approach at finite temperatures is limited to the fermi - liquid regime  @xcite ; see also  ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "lastly , we briefly discussed the results of the variational approach to the anderson transition in strongly correlated one - band systems .    in principle",
    ", we could go beyond the limitations of the gutzwiller approximation and systematically calculate ground - state correlation functions and @xmath116  corrections .",
    "however , the diagrammatic evaluation would be very tedious , and we consider it unlikely that such an effort will lead to qualitative changes of our understanding of band - degenerate hubbard models based on our variational approach . for the moment it appears to be more rewarding to elucidate the ground - state energy  ( [ 49 ] ) in more detail .",
    "thus far this expression was investigated only for rather simple model systems  @xcite@xcite .",
    "these preliminary studies showed significant differences for the ground - state magnetization as a function of the interaction strength between the hartree  fock and the gutzwiller - correlated wave functions , as expected from the one - band case . furthermore , discontinuous metal - insulator transitions occur for @xmath95 for which the gap jumps to a finite value at the critical interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the variational ground - state phase diagram for realistic models , e.g. , for five @xmath0  orbitals , is a numerically difficult task because the number of variational parameters exponentially increases with the number of orbitals .",
    "nevertheless , one may use various symmetries between different multiple occupancies which considerably reduces the number of independent variational parameters such that the realistic case @xmath5 for transition metals and their compounds should become tractable .",
