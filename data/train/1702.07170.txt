    "despite being the most promising two - dimensional ( 2d ) material , gapless graphene has limitations of its applications in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics .",

    "belonging to the family of layered tmcd , molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) has been widely used in numerous areas , such as hydrodesulfurization catalyst , photovoltaic cell , photocatalyst , nanotribology , lithium battery , and dry lubrication , due to their distinctive electronic , optical , and catalytic properties  @xcite . in monolayer mos@xmath0 , a strong photoluminescence peak at about @xmath2 ev , together with peaks at about @xmath2 and @xmath3 ev of the adsorption spectrum ,",

    "the single layer of mos@xmath0 is expected to be promising material for the solar cells because of high absorption in the visible frequency range , it can be complementary to graphene , which has low absorption in the visible frequency range and high conductivity in the far - infrared region , and therefore is suitable for solar cell technology @xcite .",
    "therefore mos@xmath0 has become a very interesting material owing to unique electronic and optical properties  @xcite .",
    "the collective density oscillations of a doped two - dimensional crystalline systems have recently been attracted  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the propagation of graphene plasmons has been directly imaged in real space by using scattering - type scanning near - field optical microscopy  @xcite in which the plasmon wavelength much smaller than the free - space excitation wavelength , allowing an extreme concentration of electromagnetic energy .",
    "this allows that graphene plasmon properties can easily be gate tuned .",
    "moreover , the energy of the metallic plasmon mode is restricted by the achievable carrier concentration and this limits the application of graphene plasmonics to the tetrahertz regime .",
    "metallic tmdcs have much higher charge carrier densities stemming from a quite flat band structures leading to plasmon energies of around 1 ev in bulk tmdcs @xcite .",

    "the dynamical density - density response function of monolayer and bilayer mos@xmath0 are calculated within the tddft and rpa theory . having known the density - density response function , we therefore can calculate the macroscopic dielectric function whose imaginary part gives the optical absorption spectrum and the collective modes are established by the zero in the real part of the macroscopic dielectric function .",
