    "in recent years , the understanding of the dynamics of a variety of finite temperature gauge theories at strong coupling has been much improved by employing several techniques from string theory to capture the physics .",
    "the framework is that of holographic @xcite gauge / gravity duality , in which the physics of a non  trivial ten dimensional string theory background can be precisely translated into that of the gauge theory for which the rank ( @xmath0 ) of the gauge group is large@xcite , while the number ( @xmath3 ) of fundamental flavours of quark is small compared to @xmath0 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "many aspects of the gauge theory , at strong t hooft coupling @xmath4 , become accessible to computation since the string theory background is in a regime where the necessary string theory computations are classical or semi  classical , with geometries that are weakly curved@xcite ( characteristic radii in the geometry are set by @xmath5 ) .",
    "these studies are not only of considerable interest in their own right , but have potential phenomenological applications , since there are reasons to suspect that they are of relevance to the dynamics of quark matter in extreme environments such as heavy ion collision experiments , where the relevant phase seems to be a quark  gluon plasma . while the string theory duals of qcd are not known , and will be certainly difficult to obtain computational control over ( the size @xmath0 of the gauge group there is small , and the number , @xmath3 , of quark flavours is comparable to @xmath0 ) it is expected ( and a large and growing literature of evidence seems to support this  see below ) that there are certain features of the physics from these accessible models that may persist to the case of qcd , at least when in a strongly coupled plasma phase .",
    "studied examples have included various hydrodynamic properties , such as the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy , as well as important phenomenological properties of the interactions between quarks and quark jets with the plasma .",
    "results from these sorts of computations in the string dual language have compared remarkably well with qcd phenomenological results from the heavy ion collision experiments at rhic ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and have proven to be consistent with and supplementary to results from the lattice gauge theory approach .",
    "there are many other phenomena of interest to study in a controllable setting , such as confinement , deconfinement ( and the transition between them ) , the spectrum and dynamics of baryons and mesons , and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these models provide a remarkably clear theoretical laboratory for such physics , as shown for example in some of the early work@xcite  making use of the understanding of the introduction of fundamental quarks .",
    "some of the results of these types of studies are also likely to be of interest for studies of qcd , while others will help map out the possibilities of what types of physics are available in gauge theories in general , and guide us toward better control of the qcd physics that we may be able to probe using gauge / string duals .",
    "this is the spirit of our current paper . here",
    ", we uncover many new results for a certain gauge theory at finite temperature and in the presence of a background external magnetic field , building on work done recently@xcite on the same theory at zero temperature .    at vanishing temperature and magnetic field , the large @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory has @xmath2 supersymmetry , and the quarks are in hypermultiplet representations .",
    "nevertheless , just as for studies of the even more artificial @xmath6 pure gauge theory , the physics at finite temperature  that of a strongly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons in a variety of phases  has a lot to teach us about gauge theory in general , and possibly qcd in particular .    in section two",
    "we describe the holographically dual ten  dimensional geometry and the embedding of the probe d7brane into it . in section three",
    "we extract the physics of the probe dynamics , using both analytic and numerical techniques .",
    "it is there that we deduce the phase diagram . in section four",
    "we present our computations of various thermodynamic properties of the system in various phases , and in sections five and six we present our computations and results for the low  lying parts of the spectra of various types of mesons in the theory .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in section seven .",
    "consider the ads@xmath7schwarzschild@xmath8 solution given by : @xmath9 the dual gauge theory will inherit the time and space coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "also , in the solution above , @xmath12 is a radial coordinate on the asymptotically ads@xmath7 geometry and we are using standard polar coordinates on the @xmath13 .",
    "the scale @xmath14 determines the gauge theory t hooft coupling according to @xmath15 . for the purpose of our study it will be convenient @xcite to perform the following change of variables : @xmath16 the expression for",
    "the metric now takes the form : @xmath17 following ref .",

    "@xcite , while this does not change the supergravity background , it has a non  trivial effect on the physics of the probe , which is our focus . to study the effects on the probe ,",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for the ads@xmath30 geometry , we can consistently set the gauge field @xmath28 to zero to leading order in @xmath31 , and the same argument applies to the finite temperature case considered here .",
    "the resulting lagrangian is : @xmath32 for large @xmath33 , the lagrangian asymptotes to : @xmath34 which suggests the following asymptotic behavior for the embedding function @xmath35 : @xmath36 where the parameters @xmath37 ( the asymptotic separation of the d7 and d3branes ) and @xmath38 ( the degree of transverse bending of the d7brane in the @xmath39 plane ) are related to the bare quark mass @xmath40 and the fermionic condensate @xmath41 respectively @xcite ( this calculation is repeated in appendix  [ appendix : condensate ] ) .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the presence of the external magnetic field spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry of the dual gauge theory ( it generates a non  zero @xmath42 at zero @xmath37 ) .",
    "however@xcite , the effect of the finite temperature is to melt the mesons and restore the chiral symmetry at zero bare quark mass .",
    "therefore , we have two competing processes depending on the magnitudes of the magnetic field @xmath23 and the temperature @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests an interesting two dimensional phase diagram for the system , which we shall study in detail later .    to proceed , it is convenient to define the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath44 this leads to the lagrangian : @xmath45 for small values of @xmath46 , the analysis of the second order , non  linear differential equation for @xmath47 derived from equation ( [ lagrangian ] ) follows closely that performed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the solutions split into two classes : the first class are solutions corresponding to embeddings that wrap a shrinking @xmath48 in the @xmath13 part of the geometry and ( when the @xmath48 vanishes ) closes at some finite radial distance @xmath49 above the black hole s horizon , which is located at @xmath50 .",
    "these embeddings are referred to as ` minkowski ' embeddings .",
    "the second class of solutions correspond to embeddings falling into the black hole , since the @xmath51 of the euclidean section , on which the d7branes are wrapped , shrinks away there .",
    "these embeddings are referred to as ` black hole ' embeddings .",
    "there is also a critical embedding separating the two classes of solutions which has a conical singularity at the horizon , where the @xmath48 wrapped by the d7brane shrinks to zero size , along with the @xmath51 .",
    "if one calculates the free energy of the embeddings , one can show @xcite that it is a multi  valued function of the asymptotic separation @xmath37 , which amounts to a first order phase transition of the system ( giving a jump in the condensate ) for some critical bare quark mass @xmath52 .",
    "( for fixed mass , we may instead consider this to be a critical temperature . )",
    "we show in this paper that the effect of the magnetic field is to decrease this critical mass , and , at some critical magnitude of the parameter @xmath53 , the critical mass drops to zero . for @xmath54",
    "the phase transition disappears , and only the minkowski embeddings are stable states in the dual gauge theory , possessing a discrete spectrum of states corresponding to quarks and anti ",
    "quarks bound into mesons .",
    "furthermore , at zero bare quark mass , we have a non  zero condensate and the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "it is instructive to first study the properties of the solution for @xmath55 .",
    "this approximation holds for finite temperature , weak magnetic field , and large bare quark mass @xmath37 , or , equivalently , finite bare quark mass @xmath37 , low temperature , and weak magnetic field .    in order to analyze the case @xmath56 ,",
    "let us write @xmath57 for @xmath58 and linearize the equation of motion derived from equation ( [ lagrangian ] ) , while leaving only the first two leading terms in @xmath59 .",
    "the result is : @xmath60 ignoring the @xmath61 terms in equation ( [ bigm ] ) , the general solution takes the form : @xmath62 where we have taken @xmath63 . by studying the asymptotic behavior of this solution , we can extract the following : @xmath64 by inverting the expression for @xmath65 , we can express @xmath66 in terms of @xmath65 : @xmath67 finally , after going back to dimensionful parameters , we can see that the theory has developed a fermionic condensate : @xmath68 the results of the above analysis can be trusted only for finite bare quark mass and sufficiently low temperature and weak magnetic field .",
    "as can be expected , the physically interesting properties of the system should be described by the full non  linear equation of motion of the d7brane . to explore",
    "these we need to use numerical techniques .",
    "we solve the differential equation derived from equation ( [ lagrangian ] ) numerically using mathematica .",
    "it is convenient to use infrared initial conditions @xcite . for the minkowski embeddings , based on symmetry arguments , the appropriate initial conditions are : @xmath69 for the black hole embeddings , the following initial conditions : @xmath70 ensure regularity of the solution at the event horizon . after solving numerically for @xmath47 for fixed value of the parameter @xmath46 ,",
    "we expand the solution at some numerically large @xmath71 , and , using equation ( [ asymptote ] ) , we generate the plot of @xmath72 vs @xmath73 .",
    "it is instructive to begin our analysis by revisiting the case with no magnetic field ( @xmath74 , familiar from refs.@xcite .",
    "the corresponding plot for this case is presented in figure [ fig:1 ] .    .",
    "the vertical dashed line corresponds to the critical value of @xmath73 at which the first order phase transition takes place .",
    "the solid black curve dropping sharply from above is the function derived in equation ( [ weakcond ] ) , corresponding to the large mass limit.,width=340 ]    also in the figure is a plot of the large mass analytic result of equation  ( [ weakcond ] ) , shown as the thin black curve in the figure , descending sharply downwards from above ; it can be seen that it is indeed a good approximation for @xmath75 . before we proceed with the more general case of non  zero magnetic field , we review the techniques employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the critical value of @xmath73 . in figure",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we have presented the region of the phase transition considerably magnified .     curve has the interpretation of the free energy of the d7brane ; thus the phase transition pattern obeys the `` equal area law'' the area of the shaded regions is equal.,width=340 ]    near the critical value @xmath76 , the condensate @xmath77 is a multi - valued function of @xmath73 , and we have three competing phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is known@xcite to be proportional to the first derivative of the free energy of the d7brane , and therefore the area below the curve of the @xmath72 vs @xmath73 plot is proportional to the free energy of the brane .",
    "thus , the phase transition happens where the two shaded regions in figure [ fig:2 ] have equal areas ; furthermore , for @xmath78 , the upper  most branch of the curve corresponds to the stable phase , and the lower  most branch of the curve corresponds to a meta  stable phase . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the lower  most branch of the curve corresponds to the stable phase , and the upper  most branch of the curve corresponds to a metastable phase . at @xmath80",
    "we have a first order phase transition .",
    "it should be noted that the intermediate branch of the curve corresponds to an unstable phase .",
    "now , let us turn on a weak magnetic field .",
    "as one can see from figure [ fig:3 ] , the effect of the magnetic field is to decrease the magnitude of @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , the condensate now becomes negative for sufficiently large @xmath73 and approaches zero from below as @xmath81 .",

    "the negative values of @xmath73 do not mean that we have negative bare quark masses ; rather , it implies that the d7brane embeddings have crossed @xmath84 at least once .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that such embeddings are not consistent with a holographic gauge theory interpretation and are therefore to be considered unphysical",
    ". we will adopt this interpretation here , therefore taking as physical only the @xmath85 branch of the @xmath72 vs @xmath73 plots .",
    "however , the prescription for determining the value of @xmath52 continues to be valid , as long as the obtained value of @xmath76 is positive .",
    "therefore , we will continue to use it in order to determine the value of @xmath86 for which @xmath87 .",
    "there are states with negative @xmath73 , which are considered non - physical .",
    "however the equal area law is still valid as long as @xmath88.,width=340 ]    as one can see in figure [ fig:6 ] , the value of @xmath53 that we obtain is @xmath89 .",
    "note also that , for this value of @xmath46 , the minkowski @xmath90 embedding has a non ",
    "zero fermionic condensate @xmath91 , and hence the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the stable solutions are purely minkowski embeddings , and the first order phase transition disappears ; therefore , we have only one class of solutions ( the blue curve ) that exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at zero bare quark mass .",
    "some black hole embeddings remain meta  stable , but eventually all black hole embeddings become unstable for large enough @xmath46 .",
    "this is confirmed by our study of the meson spectrum , which we present in later sections of the paper .",
    "the critical parameter @xmath52 vanishes .",

    "the curve separates the two phases corresponding to a discrete meson spectrum ( light mesons ) and a continuous meson spectrum ( melted mesons ) respectively .",
    "the crossing of the curve is associated with the first order phase transition corresponding to the melting of the mesons .",
    "if we cross the curve along the vertical axis , we have the phase transition described in refs .",
    "@xcite . crossing",
    "the curve along the horizontal axis corresponds to a transition from unbroken to spontaneously broken chiral symmetry@xcite , meaning the parameter @xmath77 jumps from zero to @xmath94 , resulting in non  zero fermionic condensate of the ground state .",

    "@xcite : @xmath98 , which implies that @xmath96 for @xmath99 .",
    "the plot of the numerically extracted dependence @xmath100 is presented in figure [ fig : ccrit ] ; for @xmath92 , @xmath101 very fast approaches the curve @xmath102 .",
    "this suggests that the value of the chiral symmetry breaking parameter @xmath103 depends mainly on the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath23 , and only weakly on the temperature @xmath104 .",
    "having understood the phase structure of the system , we now turn to the extraction of various of its important thermodynamic quantities .",
    "looking at our system from a thermodynamic point of view , we must specify the potential characterizing our ensemble .",
    "we are fixing the temperature and the magnetic field , and hence the appropriate thermodynamic potential density is : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the magnetization density and @xmath107 is the entropy density of the system . following ref .",

    "therefore , we can omit this term in the definition of @xmath108 . the boundary action @xmath114 contains counterterms",
    "designed@xcite to cancel the divergent terms coming from the integral in equation ( [ action ] ) in the limit of @xmath115 .",
    "a crucial observation is that the finite temperature does not introduce new divergences , and we have the usual quartic divergence from the spatial volume of the asymptotically ads@xmath7 spacetime  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the non  zero external magnetic field introduces a new logarithmic divergence , which can be cancelled by introducing the following counterterm : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the metric of the 4dimensional surface at @xmath118 .",
    "note that in our case : @xmath119 which gives us the freedom to add finite terms of the form @xmath113 at no cost to the regularized action .",
    "this makes the computation of some physical quantities scheme dependent .",
    "we will discuss this further in subsequent sections .",
    "the final form of @xmath114 in equation ( [ action ] ) is : @xmath120 it is instructive to evaluate the integral in equation ( [ action ] ) for the @xmath121 embedding at zero temperature .",
    "going back to dimensionful coordinates we obtain : @xmath122 the first two terms are removed by the counter terms from @xmath114 , and we are left with : @xmath123 this result can be used to evaluate the magnetization density of the yang ",
    "mills plasma at zero temperature and zero bare quark mass .",
    "let us proceed by writing down a more general expression for the free energy of the system .",
    "after adding the regulating terms from @xmath114 , we obtain that our free energy is a function of @xmath124 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is defined _ via _ : @xmath127 in order to verify the consistency of our analysis with our numerical results , we derive an analytic expression for the free energy that is valid for @xmath128 .",
    "to do this we use that for large @xmath73 , the condensate @xmath77 is given by equation ( [ weakcond ] ) , which we repeat here : @xmath129 as well as the relation @xmath130 .",
    "we then have : @xmath131 where the function @xmath132 can be obtained by evaluating the expression for @xmath133 from equation ( [ tildeaction ] ) in the approximation @xmath134 .",
    "note that this suggests ignoring the term @xmath135 , which is of order @xmath136 .",
    "since the leading behavior of @xmath136 at large @xmath73 is @xmath137 , this means that the results obtained by setting @xmath138 can be trusted to the order of @xmath139 , and therefore we can deduce the function @xmath132 , corresponding to the zeroth order term .",
    "another observation from earlier in this paper is that the leading behavior of the condensate is dominated by the magnetic field and therefore we can further simplify equation ( [ tildeaction ] ) : @xmath140 comparing to equation ( [ tildeaction1 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath141 and our final expression for @xmath133 , valid for @xmath128 : @xmath142      our next goal is to calculate the entropy density of the system . using our expressions for the free energy we can write : @xmath143 it is useful to calculate the entropy density at zero bare quark mass and zero fermionic condensate .",
    "to do this , we need to calculate the free energy density by evaluating the integral in equation ( [ tildeaction ] ) for @xmath144 .",
    "the expression that we get for @xmath145 is : @xmath146 the corresponding expression for the entropy density is : @xmath147 one can see that the entropy density is positive and goes to zero as @xmath97 .",
    "our next goal is to solve for the entropy density at finite @xmath73 for fixed @xmath46 .",
    "to do so , we have to integrate numerically equation ( [ entropy ] ) and generate a plot of @xmath148 versus @xmath73 .",
    "however , for @xmath128 we can derive an analytic expression for the entropy . after substituting the expression from equation ( [ tildeaction2 ] ) for @xmath133 into equation ( [ entropy ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath149 or if we go back to dimensionful parameters : @xmath150 one can see that if we send @xmath97 , while keeping @xmath46 fixed we get the @xmath151 behavior described in ref .",
