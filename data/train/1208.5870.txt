    "in wireless communications networks , bonding multiple frequency bands into one virtual channel improves the transmission speed for individual network users at the medium access control ( mac ) layer , as the channel throughput is theoretically linearly dependent on channel bandwidth .",
    "practical evaluation of channel bonding concepts has attracted substantial amount of attention , especially from the wireless local area networks ( wlan ) research community  @xcite .",
    "furthermore channel bonding is already present in some wireless networking standards , including ieee 802.11n , ieee 802.11ac and ieee 802.22 .",
    "intuitively , in networks utilizing channel bonding , each data flow will be transmitted faster as more channels are used for an individual connection .",
    "however , more occupied channels for one user translate into less data transmission opportunities for other network nodes  @xcite . while this relationship is obvious , its analytical aspects have been relatively unexplored . moreover , to the best of our knowledge , analytical models exploring this tradeoff and potential benefits of channel bonding mac protocols",
    "do not exist .",
    "surprisingly , the channel bonding concept has not been addressed analytically in the context of opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) network behavior , specifically considering mac layer features ( particularly random access mode ) and pu and su traffic characteristics .",
    "as osa networks utilize multiple , potentially non - contiguous channels , with primary users ( pus ) randomly reappearing on their respective channels , it is important to understand the performance of channel bonding mac protocols for osa networks .",
    "the objective of the paper is to understand the conditions under which it is beneficial to bond multiple frequency channels for osa networks . to accomplish this",
    ", we present a mathematical framework based on a markov chain analysis that enables the performance of channel bonding to be compared against classical osa mac protocols that do not use channel bonding .",
    "the framework enables the investigation of average mac level network throughput as a function of the number of osa network users , the number of frequency channels , channel bonding order , traffic level of secondary users ( sus ) , pu activity , and the spectrum sensing method , among many other parameters . the system model in our work",
    "is founded upon the model of  @xcite and historically upon the model of  @xcite .",
    "this has provided for an ease of comparison of our results with earlier models of ( non - bonded ) multichannel mac protocols .",
    "however , unique properties of our model ( especially the allowance of channel bonding , which has not been considered in  @xcite ) resulted in a fundamentally new formulation of the markov chain used in calculating the performance metrics .    in the literature related to channel bonding performance , one of the first studies of channel bonding",
    "is found in  @xcite , where mac protocols with channel bonding were advocated for throughput increase .",
    "it has been shown experimentally that channel bonding results in a large benefit for wireless networks . in this study",
    "only a small - scale network , i.e. with less than four nodes , was considered , thus it was unknown if the conclusions hold for large network sizes . in",
    "@xcite the authors present measurement results of channel bonding functionality in ieee 802.11n .",
    "they show through experiments that when transmitted power is fixed for wlans with and without channel bonding , the network with bonded channels obtains smaller throughput than a network without this option enabled . to alleviate this",
    "problem authors propose an algorithm that adaptively merges the channels depending on the perceived link quality , where users with the same link quality are associated with the same access point .",
    "the algorithm has been evaluated only through experiments . in another study",
    "@xcite a wlan system with channel width adaptation was developed utilizing ofdm .",
    "a fixed number of channels were used , thus the effect of channel bonding adaptation on the network performance was not investigated . summarizing , the investigation of channel bonding mac protocols was strictly limited to the experimental platforms and it is unknown how channel bonding mac protocols perform in scenarios not considered in the above mentioned studies .",
    "a separate group of papers on channel bonding performance in an osa context relates to early analytical studies .",
    "the benefit of channel bonding ( in a broader context of frequency agility ) has been evaluated analytically in  @xcite .",
    "this study assumed that the osa network assigns channels on a pre - detected pool of frequency bands , and mac protocols are abstracted and not considered . in  @xcite a spectrum allocation framework for osa - based wlan networks utilizing dynamically changing channel bonds was presented .",
    "first , a static and centralized channel allocation framework was proposed .",
    "then a distributed mac protocol utilizing a spectrum allocation scheme called b - smart was discussed , and an analytical model based on a markov chain analysis was used to assess the control channel throughput of b - smart . the model used approximating expressions related to the probabilities of frame collision , frames being idle and successful frame transmission from  @xcite , which were applicable only to non - modified ieee 802.11 systems with a distributed coordination function . the work in  @xcite has been extended to wlan networks in  @xcite , where an analytical framework to evaluate efficiency of channel bonding for non - osa networks with multiple access points has been proposed .",
    "however , as in the case of  @xcite , the framework was applicable to static frequency allocation only , where the specifics of the protocol that network nodes use for communication were not a focus of the approach .",
    "the tool to model the problem was based on a linear programming formulation from which linear programming relaxation and a greedy heuristic were developed . a similar approach to analyze channel bonding",
    "was presented in  @xcite , where analysis of an osa ad - hoc network with static channel allocation for users cooperating with access points was analyzed .",
    "non - contiguous channel allocation was allowed with more than one channel assigned to a single su . in summary , all existing analytical tools to evaluate channel bonding are applicable to static frequency allocation and do not consider mac protocol features . in the context of our work we need to mention  @xcite , where a channel bonding feature for ieee 802.22 networks was investigated .",
    "however , the proposed model only used approximations to reach a tractable solution , was applicable to static resource allocation networks based on ofdma , and did not consider random access features of the mac protocol .",
    "finally , we need to mention experimental osa platforms with channel bonding .",
    "one of the first networks utilizing channel bonding for osa network was the whitefi platform  @xcite , i.e. a fully operational wlan network working in the tv white spaces , which utilized varying size channels for data communications , i.e. 5 , 10 and 20mhz .",
    "in whitefi channel bonding was possible only for adjacent channels .",
    "performance of the platform was evaluated via simulations and experimentation with a limited set of prototype devices .",
    "a description of some of the algorithms and hardware used in whitefi platform was also discussed in  @xcite .",
    "other osa network prototypes utilizing channel bonding can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the so called jello framework fused multiple non - contiguous bands into one virtual channel , which was more flexible in this respect than whitefi .",
    "indeed , the authors have shown a benefit of channel bonding , however measured only in terms of disruption rate and residual spectrum use .",
    "implemented in a gnu radio , jello was evaluated in a testbed consisting of only a few nodes where the results were compared against simulation . in addition , off - line experimental studies of channel allocation for osa , based on real - life measurement data of pu occupancy , have been presented in  @xcite . again , while this interesting study clearly showed how networks can benefit from accessing pu occupied channels , and how channel bonding benefits osa networks , there are no analytical results that were presented therein .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section  [ sec : system_model ] , while the analytical model is presented in section  [ sec : analytical_model ] .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] and the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we assume a single hop osa ad - hoc network composed of @xmath0 nodes communicating with each other using multichannel mac with a dedicated control channel ( dcc ) , as discussed first in  @xcite . each node is assumed to transmit a saturated flow of framed data , where each new frame is generated with probability @xmath1 .",
    ", i.e. the connection request probability , governs the collision resolution strategy . a higher value of @xmath2 results in a higher number of collisions on the control channel , while a lower @xmath2 results in fewer collisions leading to a lower channel utilization .",
    "furthermore , note that the assumption of traffic saturation for each node follows the classical assumption of many other works that have considered performance analysis of mac protocols .",
    "as  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii - b ) notes `` ( ... ) saturation throughput is a major performance measure to evaluate mac protocols '' .",
    "we refer for example to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii - c ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) , where such an assumption has been made while analyzing osa mac protocols . note that by `` saturated '' traffic we mean traffic which is always sent by every node , however , at non - regular intervals governed by the control channel access probability @xmath2 .",
    "nodes contend for the channel access by transmitting a request to send ( rts ) frame via dcc , requesting a connection to other user of the network .",
    "the connection request is successful when only one su requests a connection .",
    "the connection is established when the intended receiver responds with clear to send ( cts ) frame on dcc when it is not involved in data exchange with other users . at the event of collision",
    "all connection requests are lost and users must contend for the dcc access after a random amount of time .",
    "this approach closely mimics the operation of the s - aloha protocol .",
    "pu and su transmission is slotted ( sus follow pus slot boundaries ) .",
    "the assumption on the slotted transmission of the su and its synchrony with the pu is common in theoretical mac analysis for osa networks , see for example  ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii - a )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii - a ) . moreover ,",
    "the assumption of pu / su slot synchrony is due to conformity with our previous work on multichannel mac protocols for osa networks , i.e.  @xcite , where the same assumption has been made .",
    "this allows for an easy comparison of the results obtained in this paper with the previous results we have obtained on osa multichannel mac protocol performance .",
    "furthermore , certain papers , e.g.  @xcite do assume pu / su synchrony in the practical network scenarios ( in the case of  @xcite : secondary gsm network use , and in the context of  @xcite : secondary ieee 802.16 network use ) .",
    "then , we emphasize that the pu / su slot synchrony assumption allows for obtaining upper bounds on the throughput in comparison to slot - asynchronous interface , as it has been remarked in  @xcite .",
    "please note however , that our model can indeed be generalized to a non - slotted pu / su transmission .",
    "however , this would require further analysis on channel access policies , like those performed in  @xcite , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "each slot is @xmath3 seconds long , with @xmath4 seconds of the spectrum sensing time performed at the beginning of the time slot by osa network users and @xmath5 is equal to a length of one rts / cts frame exchange .",
    "frame lengths are geometrically distributed such that the average frame length is @xmath6 time slots , where @xmath7 is the probability of a time slot being occupied by the frame transmission is the probability that during frame transmission next time slot will be empty .",
    "this will end transmission and force a sender to contend over a control channel for a new virtual channel for new frame transmission .",
    "] , @xmath8 is the theoretical throughput of a single physical channel , @xmath9 is the number of physical channels bonded to form a virtual channel , @xmath10 is the throughput reduction factor for a @xmath9-bonded virtual channel , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 , described in detail in section  [ sec : phy_assumptions ] , and @xmath14 is the size of the frame in bits .",
    "as we assume that the control channel throughput ( in b / s ) is the same as the throughput of data channel , i.e. @xmath8 , we can easily calculate the length of the control packet as @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , in our model data and control packets , although of different lengths , are sent at the same rate .      in the present paper , the main difference with respect to the original design of the multichannel mac with dcc ( see again  @xcite ) lies in assuming that each new connection will utilize @xmath16 out of @xmath17 channels , where @xmath18 is the total number of channels , one channel is used for control data exchange only . ]",
    "at time @xmath19 , where @xmath16 is the maximum channel bond order . in the case of less than @xmath16 physical channels available for a new connection , all free channels are used for a frame transmission .",
    "we assume a set of accessible pu channels ( which still can be randomly occupied by pus ) is known to the whole network and assigned unique identifiers .",
    "the sender , through the rts frame , communicates to the receiver the information on the ordered set of available channels seen from its perspective , just like in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.1 ) ( in the context of continuous frequency blocks ) .",
    "next the receiver , through the cts frame , replies with the set of ordered available channels from its perspective . after a successful rts / cts exchange",
    "both the sender and the receiver switch to the first @xmath16 channels that are common to both of them .",
    "we assume that each communicating pair is able to bond non - adjacent frequency bands , with no guard bands considered , similar to  @xcite .",
    "thus , our framework serves as an upper bound on the performance of any channel bonding protocol considering physical layer constraints on the channel bonding process . note that an analysis of the optimal channel bond resource allocation , considering guard bands , were considered recently , e.g. , in  @xcite . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we refer to this channel bonding mac protocol as flexible channel bonding .      each pu channel of bandwidth @xmath20 at time slot @xmath19 is randomly occupied by the pu with probability @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is geometrically distributed .",
    "while not all pu traffic is memoryless , refer e.g. to studies of  @xcite that prove such a statement , many studies reveal that the complete opposite is true .",
    "various pu systems can indeed be correctly described by a memoryless process .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , one of the most complete long - term studies of channel occupancy by various wireless systems , the geometric distribution is quite common , constituting almost 60% of pu traffic distributions for systems of interest , including dect , gsm ( 900/1800 ) and 2.4ghz ism .",
    "due to a single hop domain analysis we can reasonably assume for tractability that each osa node performs detection individually and the decision on the pu state is the same for each node in the osa network .",
    "furthermore , each osa node is equipped with a wideband spectrum sensor to obtain information about all pu channels during the sensing phase .",
    "decision on the pu state is prone to errors due to false alarm , @xmath22 , or mis - detection , @xmath23 .",
    "assuming rayleigh fading and gaussian noise the respective expressions are given in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 1 ) ) and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 3 ) ) . for those expressions we will give respective values for the pu channel bandwidth @xmath20 and snr @xmath24 of the pu signal at the su energy detector with detection threshold @xmath25 , resulting in required @xmath22 and @xmath26 , when presenting the numerical results",
    "we assume that the osa network loses throughput only due to false alarms , and it can successfully deconstruct a frame on the arrival of a pu during a mis - detection . on the other hand , we assume that the detection of a pu on any of the physical channels constituting one virtual channel causes termination of an entire frame transmission .",
    "although this is a very conservative strategy it simplifies the analysis significantly , while also serving as a lower bound on the obtained mac throughput considering frame disruption resolution strategies .      in the analysis we consider two cases with respect to virtual channel throughput . in the first case",
    "we assume that throughput of a virtual channel with @xmath9 bonds is exactly @xmath27 , as in  @xcite , i.e. @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 . in the second case we assume , due to the fixed power that users can emit per virtual channel , the throughput for a @xmath9-bonded channel is @xmath30 , where @xmath12 @xmath31 and @xmath11 . note that the function @xmath10 can be defined arbitrarily @xmath12 , depending on what physical layer constraint is considered , e.g. , it can mimic the exponential decay of throughput for virtual channels of increasing orders , or it can mimic step - wise throughput reduction with increasing @xmath9 .      for comparison in this study",
    "we also consider other multichannel mac protocols .",
    "the first protocol is a classic multichannel mac protocol analyzed first in  @xcite , where bonding is not allowed , i.e. channel bonding protocol with @xmath32 .",
    "the second protocol , denoted as @xmath16-only bonding multichannel mac , is a less flexible version of the main channel bonding mac protocol .",
    "that is , when a newly admitted connection sees fewer than @xmath16 free channels , then this connection is blocked and the user contends again for the channel access .",
    "this protocol mimics the operation of networks which are able to bond only a fixed number of channels per newly arriving frame .",
    "the third protocol is an adaptive version of the considered channel bonding multichannel mac protocol , that changes the order of channel bonding dynamically depending on the network and/or traffic conditions .",
    "details of the protocol will be presented in section  [ sec : results_adaptive_bonding ] . in the paper",
    "we will study the flexible channel bonding mac protocol via analysis , while @xmath16-only channel bonding and adaptive channel bonding will be considered via simulations .",
    "to calculate network - wide average mac layer network throughput we propose to use a markov chain analysis framework .",
    "the model presented here extends the work of  @xcite to the case of channel bonding .",
    "therefore we follow the same naming convention and use the same definition of connection arrangement and termination probabilities ( as the system model in this work follows those of  @xcite and the earlier model of  @xcite ) . however , the structure of the markov chain , formulation of transition probabilities , introduction of a new function : connection preemption probability , and calculation of performance metrics are fundamentally new and unique to our work .",
    "the roadmap of this section is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : chain_definition ] we introduce the definition of a markov chain used to analyze our proposed mac protocol .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : arrangement_probability ] and section  [ sec : termination_probability ] we present the definition of the connection arrangement and connection termination probability , respectively , while in section  [ sec : overlap_probability ] we introduce the definition of the connection preemption probability .",
    "these three functions govern the way connections are established and terminated within the osa network of interest .",
    "section  [ sec : transition_probability ] derives the complete markov chain transition probabilities ( using the three above mentioned functions ) which are later used in section  [ sec : metric_calculation ] to derive the performance metrics of interest .      assuming without loss of generality that @xmath33 , i.e. that the osa network needs to compete for limited resources , let @xmath34 denote a state of the markov chain at time @xmath19 , where state , @xmath35 denotes the number of active connections occupying @xmath36 physical channels at time @xmath19 . then",

    "hence the bonded systems provide for an improvement in throughput in the range of @xmath177 .",
    "this proves that there is a benefit of channel bonding even when the osa network is unable to exploit the full theoretical capacity provided by the virtual channel .",
    "finally , we add that ( not shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : impact_aincr ] due to space constraints ) as the pu activity increases , the effect of the penalty function becomes marginal as preemption dominates incoming su connections .",

    "[ fig : m_thr_qp01 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : m_thr_qp03 ] ( the increase is in orders of magnitude in comparison to strategy a ) .",

    "[ fig : m_col_qp03 ] .",
    "this result clearly shows that there is a trade - off between frame disruption resolvability and collisions induced to pus by osa operation . the larger the osa frame and and the larger the pu activity per channel , the larger the collision rate , see fig .  [",
    "fig : m_col_qp03 ] where almost 2% collision probability is reached ( which is again in the orders of magnitude larger than in the a strategy ) .",
    "interestingly , with increase in @xmath16 the collision probability rate decreases . this is because with a large channel bonding pool , there is less probability that free channels can be found for switching and the frame is dropped , in - turn reducing probability of further collisions with the pu .",
    "we want to emphasize that with the s strategy , the conclusions obtained for osa channel bonding mac with the a strategy still hold .",
    "mainly , the order of bonding preference is preserved and in most cases @xmath32 outperforms other bonding schemes in terms of throughput .",
    "in previous sections we have assumed that the channels are used equiprobably by each pu . in this case",
    ", the osa network channel selection strategy does not have an effect on the mac protocol performance as each selected channel has the same probability of being disrupted by the pu .",
    "however , as the channels become non - uniformly used by pus , the selection of a successive channel for each new bond might have a profound effect on the osa network performance .",
    "therefore in this section we investigate the effect of channel selection strategies on the performance of the channel bonding mac protocol with a non - uniform distribution of pu activity over the pu channel set .",

    "specifically , we will assume that the osa network is aware of non - uniform pu channel usage and knows the first moment of pu channel distribution for every channel @xmath186 . as an example , for mathematical tractability and without loss of generality , we assume that channel @xmath36 is used by pu with probability @xmath187 where @xmath188 denotes the per channel pu activity imbalance factor . note that @xmath189 denotes equal channel utilization by the pu for each channel and @xmath190 denotes an exponential increase in channel utilization with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : chan_imb ] ) allows for a fair comparison of different channel selection strategies against uniform pu channel usage , as the mean of set @xmath191 for any @xmath188 is equal to the mean channel utilization in the case of uniform pu activity over all pu channels , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "note , however , that in ( [ eq : chan_imb ] ) @xmath21 must be selected such that it does not violate pu channel usage properties , i.e. @xmath151 @xmath192 .    in the simulation experiment we consider two channel selection strategies : random ( r ) channel selection and least - used ( l ) channel selection . in case of the l channel selection strategy the osa network , knowing how channels are used by the pu , always selects channels that are on average lowest used by the pu for each new bond ( to minimize probability of collision with the pu and prolong transmission time ) .",
    "apart from observing the osa network throughput , for a considered distribution of channel usage by the pu , we also observe how uniformly channels were used by the sus in the osa network .",

    "the gain from using the l channel selection increases as @xmath188 becomes larger .",
    "this phenomenon holds irrespective of the channel bonding size @xmath16 and is more evident as network size increases .",
    "an obvious result is that for the l channel selection strategy the fairness is much lower than that of the r strategy since the r strategy has almost a perfect fairness of 1 , especially for the small network scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aq_fai_small ] and compare with fig .",
    "[ fig : aq_fai_large ] ) .",
    "however , a more interesting ( non - obvious ) result is that with an increase of bonding size @xmath16 the fairness of the l strategy increases . this is due to more channels being used by the mac protocol simulatneously with a larger bonding order .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath195 fairness decreases as @xmath188 increases .",
    "as the pu activity distribution becomes skewer , i.e. @xmath188 becomes large , the fairness of both the l and r strategies converge .",
    "this is especially visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : aq_fai_large ] in the case of a large osa network because most of the pu activity is concentrated over a small pool of channels , while in other cases the channels are sporadically used by pus .",
    "interestingly , varying the channel selection strategy does not change the conclusions obtained earlier , e.g. @xmath32 reaches highest throughput followed by @xmath161 and then @xmath160 .",
    "+      in addition , we consider a fundamentally different channel bonding osa mac protocol , where priorities within the su network are allowed .",
    "in particular , we consider a flexible channel bonding mac , where each su is able to send two types of frames : ( i ) regular and ( ii ) high priority .",
    "the priority - enabling flexible channel bonding mac works as follows .",

    "furthermore , for consistency with earlier results presented in this paper we do not consider buffering of su connections on the event of preemption by pu connection , noting that the detailed consideration of multichannel ( non - bonding ) osa mac protocols with frame buffering , considering pu preemptions , has already been considered in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "if more than one channel is freed from pu occupancy or su transmission ( of any kind ) , then one of the buffered connections resumes transmission until either the frame is successfully transmitted or preempted by the presence of a pu .",
    "the connections to be resumed are selected randomly from the pool in the buffer and per time slot one connection reconnect is possible ( for consistency with the connection arrangement policy on the control channel ) .",

    "then we can define the following optimization function for time interval @xmath36 , necessary to find the the optimal bonding scheme :    @xmath212    where @xmath213 refer to the optimal bonding order at a specific value of @xmath21 for time interval @xmath36 , @xmath214 represents the maximum bonding level allowed , while @xmath215 and @xmath216 denote the osa network - wide required probability of false alarm and mis - detection , respectively . note that @xmath139 is a function of all parameters considered in ( [ eq : optimization2])([eq : optimization3 ] ) , while the framework to derive @xmath139 is presented in section  [ sec : analytical_model ] .    to explore the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework , we consider two network scenarios identical to those considered in section  [ sec : result_pu_impact ] , i.e. , a small and a large network scenario , with @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "all other parameters remain the same as in section  [ sec : result_pu_impact ] except that pus change their activity level in the course of the simulation from @xmath220 in increments of @xmath221 to @xmath222 .",
    "a small range of @xmath21 values were chosen in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig : impact_qp ] where it is observed that higher bond orders have better performance at @xmath223 .",
    "furthermore , as a bonding - dependent parameter we consider pu activity . during each of the above - mentioned time intervals the bonding order is assumed to remain constant .",
    "we assume that @xmath224 denotes the number of time intervals considered , while each @xmath225 in the bonding scheme @xmath226 is the bonding order for an associated value of @xmath21 .",
    "note that we do not adapt @xmath16 on su traffic conditions as they are more difficult to estimate in real - life network operation than pu statistics .",
    "for example , length of su frames are not known a priori to the receiver ( such information is not sent in the rts frame in our system model ) , thus other nodes can not estimate for how long a virtual channel will be occupied by a certain sender / receiver pair just by listening to a dcc .    in fig  [ fig : adapt_a ]",
    "we present the su throughput performance for @xmath227 and three different bonding schemes for a small network scenario and corresponding @xmath21 values : an optimal bonding scheme of @xmath228 , obtained via solving ( [ eq : optimization1])([eq : optimization2 ] ) , and for comparison @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "we immediately notice that bonding , i.e. @xmath195 for any value of @xmath21 , does not provide any gains and is in fact more harmful in terms of su throughput .",
    "this is attributed to the bonding order being nearly equal to the channel capacity of the system , @xmath162 , therefore many incoming su connections that are granted access through the control channel are blocked .",
    "furthermore , the collision resolution strategy used in the system makes it unfavorable for higher bond orders to maintain a connection because if a pu happens to occupy any single physical channel in a bonded virtual channel the entire frame is preempted , as described in section  [ sec : primary_user_detection ] .    in fig  [ fig : adapt_b ]",
    "we represent the su throughput performance in a large network scenario , for the respective @xmath21 values , considering optimal bonding scheme of @xmath229 , again obtained via solving ( [ eq : optimization1])([eq : optimization2 ] ) , and for comparison @xmath230 and @xmath228 bonding schemes . in the large network scenario @xmath231 , therefore a few bonded connections do not occupy the entire system bandwidth making it possible for multiple bonded connections to be present .",
    "this phenomenon allows the adaptive bonding scheme to utilize higher bond orders in time intervals in which @xmath232 in order to maximize the usage of channels .",
    "this is clearly visible as the adaptive bonding schemes @xmath229 and @xmath230 outperform the single - bonded scheme @xmath228 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath229 outperforms @xmath230 as it is able to reduce the bonding order with an increase in pu activity level .",
    "in addition , as concluded in section  [ sec : result_pu_impact ] , the @xmath16-only bonding scheme performs worse than the flexible channel bonding scheme for small - scale networks .",
    "this is because of the possibility of using a fixed number of channels , i.e. @xmath16 in this particular case , for each connection is smaller then that of a large - scale network ( notice the large difference in performance for the two protocol types in fig .",
    "[ fig : adapt_a ] ) .",
    "however , as the system size increases , the difference between the flexible and the @xmath16-only channel bonding mac diminishes because there is a higher probability @xmath16-order connections are made due to increased contentions on the control channel . in the case considered in this paper ,",
    "the difference between the two protocol options is almost negligible , see fig .",
    "[ fig : adapt_b ] .",
    "so far we have assumed that the pu traffic is distributed according to the geometric distribution . in this section",
    "we relax this assumption by considering the impact of a heavy - tailed distribution on the channel bonding mac protocol performance , in the same way as it was considered in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2.6 ) for the non - bonding multichannel mac protocols . in particular",
    ", we assess how the long - tail distribution of the pu activity affects the performance of the flexible channel bonding mac protocol . as an example of a long - tail distribution we use the log - normal distribution , as it was concluded in  (",
    "* table 3 and 4 ) that measured pu occupancies can be described by such a distribution in approximately 40% of the cases for gsm 900 uplink , gsm 1800 downlink , dect and 2.4ghz unii channels .",
    "we present the protocol performance for four different combinations of `` on '' and `` off '' time distributions , considering geometric and log - normal distribution , i.e. all possible combinations of `` on '' and `` off '' times obtained in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 3 and 4 ) .",
    "they are denoted symbolically as : ( i ) ee , ( ii ) el , ( iii ) le and ( iv ) ll , where ` e ' and ` l ' denote the geometric and the log - normal distribution , respectively , while the first and second position within the two - letter expression denote `` off '' and `` on '' times , respectively .",
    "just like in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2.6 ) , the parameter of the log - normal distribution was selected such that its mean value was equal to @xmath233 for the `` on '' time and @xmath234 for the `` off '' time .",
    "because the log - normal distribution is continuous , it was rounded to the nearest integer , with the scale parameter @xmath235 and location parameter @xmath236 , where @xmath237 , @xmath238 is the mean and variance of the resulting discretized log - normal distribution .",
    "note , as in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2.6 ) , that the variance of the resulting discretized log - normal distribution is equal to the variance of the geometric distribution for the same mean value .",
    "the results are presented for two types of networks denoted symbolically as small and large ( see fig  [ fig : impact_qp ] for details ) , respectively in fig  [ fig : logn_m4n12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : logn_m12n40 ] .",
    "the values of pu activity , @xmath239 , represent low activity rates , which are of the most interest for the network designer .",
    "furthermore , for the sake of clarity of the presentation we consider only two bonding orders , i.e. @xmath158 .",
    "first , we observe that the impact of log - normal pu channel occupancy distribution on the system throughput is not large as one might expect ( for example for @xmath240 and the large network , fig .  [",
    "fig : logn_m12n40 ] , the difference between the ee and le cases is less than 7% ) .",
    "if one wants to select the best combination of pu distribution that maximizes system throughput , it would be le followed by ll .",
    "the impact of the non - geometric distribution on throughput is more visible for large networks than for smaller ones , compare fig  [ fig : logn_m4n12 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : logn_m12n40 ] as in large networks there are more opportunities to exploit larger number of channels for transmission .",
    "all bonding orders are effected equally by the non - geometric process of the pu occupancy , thus all conclusions drawn for the channel bonding mac protocol using the geometrically distributed pu traffic will also hold for other combinations of pu traffic .",
    "in this paper we have developed a detailed analytical model for assessing system throughput of an ad - hoc opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) network with channel bonding .",
    "our analysis has led to a set of important conclusions .",
    "firstly , we note that there is generally a benefit of channel bonding for osa networks which is most prominent for low primary user ( pu ) channel activity and/or large pu channel pools . on the other hand , in certain cases , channel bonding might result in significant throughput loss in comparison to a classical non - bonded system , i.e. when the pu activity is large or the users per channel ratio is very large . secondly , to be able to exploit channel throughput fully , a medium access control protocol should adaptively change the channel bond order @xmath16 depending on the network conditions ( in particular the number of available resources and currently contending users ) .",
    "thirdly , with certain physical layer constraints on maximum channel capacity , e.g. due to the limited transmission power per channel , irrespective of its bandwidth , the benefit of channel bonding for ad - hoc networks is easily lost .",
    "however , networks with a small users per channel ratio are still able to obtain higher system throughput than a regular non - bonded system , even when these constraints are present , provided , again , that the pu activity level is small .",
