    "time evolution of many - body systems in which effects of quantum physics play an important role belong to the least understood physical phenomena .",
    "quantum effects prevent a fully deterministic description of time evolution and they render the problem mathematically difficult .",
    "two main aspects constitute the complexity connected with non - equilibrium phenomena and their theoretical description : long - time evolution and strong correlations .",
    "these aspects can not be considered independently from each other . due to the enormous progress in the field of ultracold atomic quantum gases in recent years , quantum many - body dynamics",
    "can now be very precisely controlled and probed and has become a timely topic for laboratory studies .",
    "on the theory side , the exponential growth of available computing power has brought quantum dynamics of many - body systems into the reach of large - scale calculations while sophisticated advanced analytical approaches open the way to a deeper understanding of quantum many - body evolution .    in situations close to equilibrium ,",
    "one can treat non - equilibrium dynamics as a perturbation of the equilibrium state . in different ways , most presently available field - theoretical methods rely to a certain extent on a perturbation expansion and either require a weak coupling or",
    "break down at large times of the evolution .",
    "this feature is inherent in principle , and it poses a serious problem when applying present results to quantum many - body dynamics far from equilibrium or to strongly coupled systems .",
    "the escape from this restriction is generally seen in refined approximations which allow to take complex correlations into account over a sufficiently long period of evolution before they cease haveing any further influence .",
    "finding suitable approximations beyond leading - order perturbation theory can become technically involved . in this respect ,",
    "functional - integral approaches including the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective - action and the real - time functional flow equation methods for quantum field dynamics represent successful ways of optimizing outcome versus effort .",
    "a central feature of these approaches is that the resulting dynamical equations conserve crucial quantities like energy , irrespective of the chosen approximation .",
    "most importantly , the methods allow approximations beyond an expansion in powers of the interaction strength .",
    "this review summarizes briefly the main aspects of the formalism and presents three examples for applications in which we compare with other methods and give specific predictions amenable to experimental investigation .      assuming basic knowledge about feynman path integrals , we sketch the functional - integral formulation of real - time quantum field theory . to derive conserving many - body dynamic equations beyond mean - field order",

    "hence , the path integral consists of a product of integrals , one for each point along the ctp .      within the schwinger - keldysh approach ,",
