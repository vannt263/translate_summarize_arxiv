    "random variables , how do we construct a weighted sum of them in order to minimize the probability of exceeding a given threshold ? for exponential distributions , which may arise naturally in different applications ( _ e.g. _ , capacities , waiting times ) , the symmetry in the problem is not sufficient to lead to a fully symmetric solution ( full diversity ) .",
    "but the minimizer still has a symmetric structure and a more general result leading to such minimizer would be interesting . yet ,",

    "the function @xmath173 is constant . in the case of the gaussian distribution , the conjecture holds and @xmath7",
    "can easily be determined .",
    "the first part of the proof , covered by lemmas [ lemma_trick ] , [ lemma_trick2 ] and [ unimodal ] , could possibly be generalized to other distributions , by imposing conditions on the derivative of the fourier transform of the sum ( or of @xmath184 ) , such that the kt conditions would only be satisfied under some symmetry of the @xmath54 s . on the other hand , without any conditions on the random variables @xmath185 , except to be i.i.d .",
    ", the conjecture does not hold , i.e. , a statement such as in conjecture [ miso ] is not universal .",
    "in fact , for @xmath186 , @xmath39 , @xmath187 , the input that _ maximizes _ the outage probability is not of the form @xmath188 , @xmath189 or @xmath190 ( it is around ( 0.2,0.8 ) ) .",
    "thus by choosing @xmath191 and @xmath192 we get a counter - example to the conjecture if stated for any independent real random variables .",

    "hence , one would have to find a more specific condition ( than i.i.d . )",
    "under which conjecture [ miso ] may hold . finally , note that conjecture [ angle ] reduces to a conjecture stated in terms of a weighted sum of random variables ( as in conjecture [ miso ] ) only when @xmath13 is unitary invariant . and",
    "the only way to have unitary invariance and independence is to assume a gaussian distribution for @xmath13 , which means that , the previous counter - examples to conjecture [ miso ] for arbitrary i.i.d .",
