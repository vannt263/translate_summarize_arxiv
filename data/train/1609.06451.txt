    "<S> we report a giant thermal shift of @xmath0 related to the excited - state zero - field splitting in the silicon vacancy centers in 4h silicon carbide . </S>",
    "<S> it is obtained from the indirect observation of the optically detected magnetic resonance in the excited state using the ground state as an ancilla . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , relative variations of the zero - field splitting for small temperature differences can be detected without application of radiofrequency fields , by simply monitoring the photoluminescence intensity in the vicinity of the level anticrossing . </S>",
    "<S> this effect results in an all - optical thermometry technique with temperature sensitivity of @xmath1 for a detection volume of approximately @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the zero - field splitting in the ground state does not reveal detectable temperature shift . using these properties , an integrated magnetic field and temperature sensor </S>",
    "<S> can be implemented on the same center .    </S>",

    "<S> contact - less methods exploit temperature - dependent features either in raman spectra of microfabricated chips @xcite or in photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of nanoprobes such as quantum dots @xcite , nanocrystals @xcite and fluorescent proteins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical temperature resolution of these methods is several hundreds of mk or lower .    </S>",
    "<S> using quantum - mechanical properties of the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) in diamond , the temperature sensitivity better than @xmath3 is achievable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the moderate thermal shift @xmath4 @xcite of the optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) frequency in the nv center ( @xmath5 at @xmath6 ) and the use of the advanced readout protocols , particularly temperature - scanned odmr @xcite or thermal spin echo @xcite . however , this method is not universally usable , because the application of high - power radiofrequency ( rf ) fields in the pulsed odmr technique may alter the temperature at the probe during the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the realization of highly - sensitive and rf - free optical thermometry is of broad interest .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the silicon vacancy ( @xmath7 ) centers in silicon carbide ( sic ) , demonstrating appealing properties for quantum sensing applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , the @xmath7 excited state @xcite shows a giant thermal shift , exceeding @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these centers reveal an exceedingly long spin memory @xcite and possess favorable absorption and pl in the near infrared spectral range @xcite , characterized by a deep tissue penetration . the concentration of the @xmath7 centers can be precisely controlled over many orders of magnitude down to single defect level @xcite and they can be incorporated into sic nanocrystals as well @xcite .    we perform proof - of - concept thermometry measurements using 4h - sic crystals . </S>",

    "<S> silicon vacancies were created by irradiation of the crystal with @xmath9 electrons with a fluence of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 centers possess a half - integer spin state @xmath11 @xcite , which is split without external magnetic field in two kramers degenerate spin sublevels @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here , we address the @xmath14 center @xcite with the zero - field splitting ( zfs ) in the ground state ( gs ) @xmath15 [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the spin states are split further when an external magnetic field @xmath16 is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the spin hamiltonian of the @xmath7 center in the magnetic field has a complex form @xcite and five rf - induced transitions are allowed : @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 . in the odmr experiments , we pump the @xmath7 centers into the @xmath13 state with a near infrared laser ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 with power in the range of several hundreds mw ) . to decrease the detection volume to approximately @xmath2 , we use a near - infrared optimized objective with n.a.=0.3 . </S>",

    "<S> we ascribe the appearance of the @xmath47 line with lowering temperature with different transition rates to the @xmath33 and @xmath40 states . </S>",
