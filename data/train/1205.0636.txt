    "it consists of the three parts @xmath16 : a path which extends from @xmath17 , around the origin counter clockwise on a circle of center the origin and of radius @xmath18 and back to @xmath19 , where @xmath18 is an arbitrarily small positive number .",

    "finally , if we go back to the original variables , ( [ sec2-eq3 ] ) simplifies to    @xmath40    now , can we interchange the sum and the integral in ( [ sec2-eq7 ] ) ?",
    "the answer is affirmative if we can show that the series @xmath41    converges absolutely and uniformly for all @xmath35 . for this purpose , we define    @xmath42    which , using ( [ sec1-eq2 ] ) , can be rewritten as    @xmath43    when @xmath14 .    the series ( [ sec2-eq8 ] ) can then be rewritten as the function @xmath1 defined by    [ sec2-def1 ] for @xmath44 and for @xmath45 , we define the function @xmath46    uniform and absolute convergence of ( [ sec2-eq8 ] ) or ( [ sec2-eq10 ] ) is a direct consequence of the asymptotic estimate of @xmath47 in proposition  [ sec3-prop4 ] to be proved later in section  [ sec3 ] .",
