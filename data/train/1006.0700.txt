    "loop quantum gravity is an approach to canonical quantum gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the kinematical states @xmath0 of the theory are given by elements in an auxiliary hilbert space @xmath1 , and are considered to correspond to quantized cauchy data for the initial value problem of general relativity .",
    "an orthonormal basis for @xmath1 is given by the spin network functions , which carry a geometrical interpretation given by the geometric operators associated to areas and volumes .",
    "quantum numbers associated to the states are graphs @xmath2 embedded in the cauchy surface @xmath3 , spins @xmath4 ( i.e. irreducible representations of @xmath5 ) along the edges of @xmath2 , together with @xmath5-intertwiners on its vertices ( see figure [ fig : graph ] ) .    , spins @xmath6 along its edges and interwiners @xmath7 along its vertices . ]",
    "evolution of classical cauchy data in general relativity is subject to constraints , which ensure the four - diffeomorphism invariance of the theory .",
    "these constraints are divided into the ( spatial ) diffeomorphism constraints @xmath8 and the hamiltonian constraint @xmath9 .",
    "correspondingly , the states @xmath0 in @xmath1 are not considered to be physical , but rather one is looking for states @xmath10 which are solutions to the constraint equations @xmath11 .    in order to obtain the physical hilbert space from the kinematical one , one usually employs a so - called `` rigging map '' , which serves as a bona fide projector .",
    "technically , this amounts to an anti - linear map @xmath12    which maps elements of a dense subspace @xmath13 of @xmath1 ( which is usually taken to be the finite linear span of the spin network functions ) into its algebraic dual .",
    "hence states are mapped into distributions , and one equips the range of @xmath14 with an inner product via @xmath15\\,|\\,\\eta[\\psi]\\,\\rangle_{\\rm phys}\\;:=\\;\\eta[\\phi](\\psi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    generically the map @xmath14 has a non - trivial kernel , and hence one has to divide the zero space out of the range of the inner product ( [ gl : physicalinnerproduct ] ) in order to make it positive definite . as a result ,",
    "several different kinematical states @xmath0 will be mapped to the same physical state @xmath16 $ ] by ( [ gl : riggingmap ] ) .",
    "this is definitely a desired feature , since , in the case of systems with constraints , states that are e.g. related by a change of gauge differ kinematically , but should be the same physically .",
    "+ in this article , we consider a specific proposal for the physical inner product ( [ gl : physicalinnerproduct ] ) in loop quantum gravity , which mimics a path integral formulation for gr in the sense that it includes a sum over histories of spin networks .",
    "this idea goes back to rovelli and reisenberger ( @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) , and lies at the foundation of spin foam models as understood in the context of loop quantum gravity .",

    "now consider a two - complex @xmath23 embedded in @xmath18 that has @xmath21 and @xmath22 as boundary .",
    "this two - complex ( which is interpreted as history of the spin network state evolving from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) is assigned the so - called `` spin foam amplitude '' @xmath24 $ ] , which is usually given in a local form @xmath25\\;=\\;\\underbrace{\\prod_{f}\\mathcal{a}_f\\prod_e\\mathcal{a}_e\\prod_v\\mathcal{a}_v}_{\\rm interior}\\;\\underbrace{\\prod_{e}\\mathcal{b}_e\\prod_v\\mathcal{b}_v}_{\\rm boundary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a particular spin foam model is chosen by a specification of the amplitudes @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 associated to the interior vertices , edges and faces of the two - complex , as well as the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 associated to the vertices and edges of the boundary spin networks @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    the physical inner product , as given by the spin foam model , is then defined as the weighted sum over all two - complexes @xmath23 that have @xmath21 and @xmath22 as boundary ( omitting the @xmath14 from now on for reasons of brevity ) , i.e. @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this definition resembles a path - integral in the sense that it is a weighted sum over histories of spin networks , as proposed by feynman .",
    "this particular form of the physical inner product as sum over embedded two - complexes has received increased interest recently ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "two of the spin foam models that are considered mostly today are the eprl @xcite and the fk model @xcite .",
    "they have evolved out of a state - sum model constructed by barrett and crane @xcite , and amount to specific choices of @xmath26 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , in the limit of large quantum numbers , the amplitudes @xmath24 $ ] , for @xmath23 being the complex dual to a four - simplex , are asymptotically equal to the cosine of the action of regge - discretised gravity for that simplex , i.e. one has @xmath32\\;\\sim\\,e^{i",

    "the reason for this is two - fold . on the one hand , by finding a large symmetry group , one can restrict the sum over @xmath23 to a sum over equivalence classes @xmath33 $ ] under the symmetry , which makes it more likely to get hold of a mathematical meaningful concept of summation in ( [ gl : physicalinnerproductwithfoams ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we will be able to make certain statements about the actual size of the physical hilbert space @xmath34 , i.e. to see which states in @xmath1 are actually mapped to the same physical states . to be more specific",
    ", we will show that for the eprl model , and any sensible definition of the sum ( [ gl : physicalinnerproductwithfoams ] ) , states @xmath0 on graphs with the same combinatorics but different knotting classes will be mapped to the same physical state under ( [ gl : riggingmap ] ) .",
    "in other words , states in the physical hilbert space will ( at most ) be labelled by combinatorial graphs , but will contain no knotting information .",
    "+ the plan for this article is as follows : we start by recalling the definition of the euclidean eprl spin foam model for arbitrary two - complexes in section [ sec : section2 ] .",
    "we moreover discuss a specific choice for the edge- , face- and boundary amplitudes . in section [ sec : deform ] we define the consistent deformation of a spin foam @xmath23 , and show that the amplitude @xmath24 $ ] is invariant under it . in section",
    "[ sec : physhil ] we describe a specific `` unknotting '' spin foam @xmath35 , compute its amplitude , and  using the symmetry of the spin foam amplitudes demonstrated in the previous chapter ",
    "show that the physical hilbert space contains no knotting information of graphs anymore .",
    "in the following we recap in detail the definitions of the eprl spin foam amplitudes , in order to make the reader familiar with our conventions , which keep close to those given in @xcite . the main difference to the more traditional ways of defining spin foams",
    "is that the two - complex in question is always regarded as embedded in a space - time manifold , and that at all times the orientation of the faces and edges of the two - complex are to be taken care of .    for the rest of the article , fix a @xmath17 manifold @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are viewed as initial and final @xmath19 hypersurface .",

    "it is given by @xmath93 ( assuming that all faces are oriented along with @xmath49 ) , leading to the edge amplitude @xmath94    another way of trivially subdividing the two - complex without changing its topology is by dissecting a face @xmath47 with representation @xmath44 into two faces @xmath95 , @xmath96 , each with the same orientation and representations @xmath97 . ) .",
    "] the intertwiner @xmath48 on the newly appeared edge @xmath98 is chosen to be the identity intertwiner @xmath99 ( see figure [ fig : subdivisionface ] ) .",
    "if one demands invariance of the spin foam amplitude @xmath24 $ ] under a trivial subdivision of a face , the edge- and face amplitudes obviously have , by ( [ gl : sfamplitude ] ) , to satisfy    @xmath100    where here @xmath49 is supplied with the identity intertwiner . with ( [ gl : edgeandvertexidentity ] ) and ( [ gl : faceandedgeidentity ] ) one arrives at an expression for the face amplitude    @xmath101    it should be noted that , unlike the invariance under trivial subdivision of faces , the invariance of @xmath24 $ ] under subdivision of an edge does not follow from the invariance of the spin networks under subdivision of an edge .",
    "we feel , however , that it is a natural invariance to demand , not only because this way one is able to fix both face- and edge - amplitudes in terms of the vertex amplitude , but also because the history of the spin network is not changed by this move , because the topology of the two - complex remains the same .",
    "it therefore seems natural that the spin foam amplitude , which contains information about the dynamics , remains the same as well .",
    "it should also be noted that the two moves described above generate all subdivisions of the two - complex which do not change the history of the spin network , i.e. which are trivial subdivisions from the point of view of the dynamics .",
    "note finally that the invariance of the spin foam amplitude under subdivision of an edge results in a formula for the amplitude which is homogenous in the scaling of the intertwiner of degree zero .",
    "the choice ( [ gl : edgeandvertexidentity ] ) is equivalent to a normalisation of the vertex amplitudes , and can therefore be absorbed into a redefinition of @xmath26 , see e.g. @xcite ( which we , however , refrain from doing here ) .",
    "the choice of the face amplitude also seems natural from the point of view of bf theory .",

    "for the rest of the article , we adopt the symmetric choice @xmath118 , i.e. @xmath119    which in particular leads to a more symmetric behaviour of the amplitudes under time - reversal .",
    "in this section we will demonstrate that the spin foam amplitudes @xmath24 $ ] defined by the eprl model possess a large symmetry , if one adapts the choices for the amplitudes from the last chapter .",
    "this symmetry will help us in proving the core statements about the properties of the physical inner product ( [ gl : physicalinnerproductwithfoams ] ) using the eprl amplitude .",
    "the first , trivially notable symmetry is that of @xmath120 , i.e. the orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath18 , since the actual value of the amplitude is only constructed using the combinatorial information of the embedding @xmath121 , e.g. which faces are connected to which edges .",
    "the change of the amplitude under an orientation - changing diffeomorphism is discussed in @xcite .    in this chapter",
    "we will , however , turn to a larger invariance of @xmath24 $ ] than just diffeomorphisms .",
    "provided we choose the amplitudes in ( [ gl : sfamplitude ] ) according to the last chapter , we will show that the spin foam amplitude is invariant under something which we term a _ consistent deformation _",

    "one therefore has to be careful what happens to e.g. the intertwiners in this case .",
    "+ we will have a look at two different `` moves '' that incorporate non - diffeomorphic deformations of the spin foam , and which leave the spin foam amplitude invariant .",

    "if this can be achieved , then one can place a three - dimensional hypersurface @xmath9 in a neighbourhood of @xmath125 which intersects @xmath23 exactly at @xmath73 ( and the embedded sphere @xmath75 at the equator , see figure [ fig : pullvertices ] ) .     in a spin foam which has a disconnected vertex graph @xmath83 can be pulled apart into two vertices @xmath126 and @xmath127    it is clear that @xmath9 divides a neighbourhood of @xmath73 of @xmath23 into two parts which only intersect at @xmath73 .",
    "the deformation we are defining consists of separating the two parts .",
    "of course , as soon as @xmath23 is separated that way , the combinatorics of the resulting @xmath128 is different : @xmath128 has two vertices @xmath126 , @xmath129 where @xmath23 had only one , namely @xmath73 .",
    "the number of edges and faces under this deformation stay the same , as well as the labels on them .",

    "this deformations , of course , needs to be done such that no other part of @xmath23 intersects with another part .",
    "the resulting vertex @xmath73 has a vertex graph @xmath83 which is of obviously disconnected so that its vertex amplitude is the product of the amplitudes of @xmath126 and @xmath129 .",
    "note that this move is possible independently of the labels on @xmath23 . whether this move can be performed on a vertex or not depends only on the embedding and topology of the two - complex @xmath23 .",

    "furthermore the boundary vertex amplitudes @xmath29 cancel two of the four edge amplitudes @xmath27 .",

    "all that remains to be done now is to compute the vertex amplitude for the one internal vertex @xmath73 in @xmath35 , which is the point where the two edges are crossing each other in order to `` entangle the knot '' . in order to do so",

    "we now show that the spin foam @xmath185 is a consistent deformation of the identity foam @xmath186 .",
    "this can be seen as follows :     and @xmath187 can be consistently deformed into each other by application of the pulling moves described above ( and their inverses ) , and removind / adding trivial vertices . ]    starting from the spin foam furthest to the left in figure [ fig : cd2 ] , let the associated intertwiner to the edge between the two internal vertices be @xmath188 , where @xmath143 is the identity map on @xmath189 , and @xmath144 the identity map on @xmath190 . as discussed in the previous section , there are two ways of pulling the internal edge connecting the two internal vertices apart , differing by a knotting class of the resulting vertex amplitudes .",
    "one results immediately in @xmath185 , as one can readily see .",
    "the other one results in two `` tubes '' ( the histories of the two loops ) which are connected at the two internal vertices . pulling the foam apart at these two vertices and then removing the two vertices ( which have become trivial ) ,",
    "one arrives at the identity foam @xmath191    as a result , for any kinematical state @xmath192 we can write down a bijection @xmath193 between the set of spin foams @xmath194 modulo consistent deformations and spin foams @xmath195 modulo consistent deformations by @xmath196\\;&\\longmapsto&\\;[\\kappa\\kappa_0]\\\\[5pt ] \\phi^{-1}\\;:\\;[\\kappa']\\;&\\longmapsto&\\;[\\kappa'\\kappa_0^{-1}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    that @xmath193 is not only well - defined but also a bijection follows from @xmath197 , i.e. the two spin foams are consistent deformations of each other . with the functorial property ( [ gl : multiplicativeamplitude ] ) and ( [ gl : knottingamplitude2 ] ) one finds that @xmath32\\;=\\;z[\\phi\\kappa]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , for each ( equivalence class of a ) spin foam @xmath198 there is exactly one ( equivalence class of a ) spin foam @xmath199 , and the spin foam amplitude is the same for each of the two .",

    "the calculations presented here were for the case of two loops interlinking each other .",
    "it should , however , have become clear that the calculations for a generic case of two graphs @xmath161 , @xmath162 with the same combinatorics but different knotting classes is performed exactly the same way .",
    "all one needs to do is trivially subdividing each pair of edges that shall `` pass through '' each other during the evolution described by the spin foam with a trivial vertex each . as a result ( [ gl : corecalculation ] ) also holds for states @xmath21 , @xmath22 situated on @xmath161 , @xmath162 .",
    "hence , the states in the physical hilbert space @xmath34 do not contain any knotting classes of graphs .",
    "in this article we have investigated properties of the physical hilbert space @xmath34 as defined by the sum - over - spin foams procedure using the euclidean eprl amplitude .",
    "the result was that @xmath34 does not contain any knotting information of the graphs in the following sense : the bona fide projector @xmath203 maps states that have the same combinatorics but different knotting classes to the same physical state .",
    "this result depends on several assumptions .",
    "the most visible assumption is that of the face- and edge amplitudes ( [ gl : edgeandvertexidentity ] ) and ( [ gl : faceandedgeidentity ] ) , as well as the boundary amplitudes ( [ gl : boundaryamplitudesymmetric ] ) .",
    "this choice was a natural consequence of demanding the invariance of the spin foam amplitude @xmath24 $ ] under trivial subdivisions ( figures [ fig : subdivisionedge ] and [ fig : subdivisionface ] ) , and the product property ( [ gl : multiplicativeamplitude ] ) .",
    "the invariance of @xmath24 $ ] under subdividing an edge with a vertex ( without conditions on the vertex , since the vertices do not carry any data ) does , strictly speaking , not follow from the canonical framework .",
    "however , it appears to be natural in the light of interpreting a spin foam as a history of a spin network . if one believes that the whole dynamical information is captured by the evolution of the graph and the representation data distributed on it , then that dynamical information is not changed under subdividing an edge with a vertex .",
    "hence the amplitude @xmath24 $ ] should not be sensitive to this change .",
    "the result we have obtained rested on a special property of the eprl amplitude , which leads to an invariance of the spin foam amplitude @xmath24 $ ] under a `` consistent deformation '' of @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that we do not propose such a consistent deformation to correspond to a physical symmetry , or be related to diffeomorphisms ( other than diffeomorphisms being a subset of the consistent deformations ) . in particular , the consistent deformations do not form a group in a straightforward way .",
    "nevertheless , the invariance is a fact , and it allows to severely reduce the summation over all spin foams to all spin foams modulo consistent deformations .",
    "hence , as a convenient tool it allows to prove statements about the physical hilbert space .",
    "the central reason for the independence of the physical hilbert space of knottings is that the `` unknotting '' spin foam @xmath35 has unit amplitude , i.e. @xmath175=1 $ ] , and the ultimate reason for this is the definition of the vertex amplitude itself .",
    "the value of @xmath26 depends only on the evaluation of a spin network embedded in @xmath75 , and this evaluation is independent of the knotting of the embedded graph .",
    "it is just sensitive to its combinatorics .",
    "it should be noted that this depends of the generalisation to the eprl amplitude given in @xcite , which was until then only defined for the case in which the corresponding graph in @xmath75 had a trivial knotting anyway .",
    "it appears to be possible to change the generalisation of the amplitude from @xcite to general spin foams by changing its sensitivity to the knotting of the vertex graph , e.g. by multiplying the vertex amplitude by a nontrivial function of knotting invariants , or by equipping the vertices of the spin foam itself with `` knotting charges '' , which , for the sake of consistency , should be trivial in the case of the four - simplex amplitude .",
    "although the physical hilbert space does not contain any knotting information of the graphs , it should be emphasized that this does _ not _ mean that the theory is insensitive to knotting within the space - time four - manifold @xmath20 $ ] ! the latter is a question concerning the expectation values of some ( four - dimensional ) observables which are computed in the theory .",
    "the shape of the boundary hilbert space is not necessarily making any statements of what possible expectation values arise in the theory , and whether they differ for different observables ( e.g. corresponding to differently knotted surfaces in @xmath18 ) or not . a prominent example which illustrates this is three - dimensional gravity as described by the ponzano regge model . the boundary hilbert space , in the loop formulation ,",
    "is given by planar spin networks embedded in the two - dimensional boundary manifold @xcite , and therefore contains no knotting information , not even on the kinematical level .",
    "the expectation value of observables corresponding to curves embedded in the three manifold ( e.g. wilson lines ) however _ do _ depend on the knotting of the embedding @xcite , being related to well - known knot invariants .",
    "it is very well possible that this also happens in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "before one has made a more precise sense of the sum - over - spin foams and has a good idea of what observables in the theory should be , it will nevertheless be hard to make any certain statements about this issue .",
