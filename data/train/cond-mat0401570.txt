    "the thermodynamic behavior of hard - disk systems has been a subject of considerable interest in recent years @xcite . in particular",

    ", the dynamical stability of such systems has been studied in detail and lyapunov spectra have been computed@xcite .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent was found to exhibit a maximum in the density regime characteristic for the fluid - to - solid transition@xcite . in a restricted geometry , such as a narrow channel ,",
    "one expects other interesting features to emerge when the width of the channel becomes comparable to the disk s size . studying narrow channels",
    "also enables one to examine long - wavelength perturbed states associated with the small positive lyapunpov exponents found in the tangent - space dynamics of hard - disk and hard - sphere systems @xcite .",
    "this provided the motivation for us to re - investigate the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of a hard - disk gas in a narrow channel .",
    "it is found that for narrow channels the pressure exhibits a singularity at a channel width equal to twice the diameter of the disks .",
    "narrower channels do not allow particles to pass each other . at the same width a singularity is also observed for the collision frequency . in addition , the maximum lyapunov exponent and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy display a non - trivial dependence on the channel width in this regime .",
    "the model we study consists of @xmath0 hard disks in a two - dimensional box with side lengths @xmath1 and aspect ratio @xmath2 .",
    "we vary the width of the box , keeping the volume @xmath3 and the particle density @xmath4 constant .",
    "very small aspect ratios @xmath5 are considered , for which the box resembles a narrow channel . for most of our work we use",
    "_ periodic _ boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "exact thermodynamic properties are known for extremely narrow channels in this case @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recently , the transport properties of two particles in a square periodic box , @xmath7 , have been studied by computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the case of two particles with _ reflecting _ boundary conditions in both directions has also received attention , both by molecular dynamics @xcite and analytical approaches @xcite .",
    "it was found that for certain aspect ratios the compressibility becomes negative .",
    "we find analogous results also for partly - reflecting boundaries , which are reflecting for the walls parallel to the long direction of the box , @xmath8 , and periodic for the walls parallel to @xmath9 .    throughout",
    ", reduced units are used for which the disk diameter @xmath10 , the particle mass @xmath11 and the kinetic energy per particle , @xmath12 , are unity .",
    "there is no potential energy in this case , and the total energy @xmath13 is identical to the kinetic energy @xmath14 . as a consequence ,",
    "the temperature @xmath15 is just an irrelevant parameter and is fixed to unity .",
    "also boltzmann s constant @xmath16 is taken unity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we consider the low - density limit . in section [ eos ]",
    "we present an analytical derivation of the pressure and show that the singularity taking place at @xmath17 already exists in this limit .",
    "in addition , we obtain an analytical expression for the collision frequency which shows a behavior very similar to that of the pressure",
    ". results of numerical simulations of these quantities and of the lyapunov spectra are presented in section [ ns ] .",
    "a numerical study of the high - density case is presented in section [ hd ] .",
    "full lyapunov spectra for periodic systems with periodic boundaries are discussed in section [ spectra ] .",
    "we close with a brief discussion of the results in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the pressure in the low - density limit is obtained by the leading terms in the virial expansion as applied to the narrow - channel geometry .",
    "let @xmath18 be the excluded volume of a single disk in the channel .",
    "the phase - space volume associated with placing @xmath0 disks in the channel is given by @xmath19 which , to leading order in the density , is reduced to @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the specific volume . for low density the specific entropy of the gas",
    "is given by @xmath22 where @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "for @xmath23 the excluded area is simply given by the area of a disk of radius @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 .",
    "to leading order in the density , the pressure @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 and is thus independent of the channel width @xmath28 .",
    "this is the expected leading - order expression of the virial expansion of a gas of hard disks .    for @xmath29 , however , the excluded area is reduced due to the interference with the disk image resulting from the periodic boundary condition in the @xmath9 direction ( see fig . [ geometry ] ) .",
    "simple geometrical considerations yield    @xmath30    where @xmath31 the excluded volume @xmath18 depends on @xmath28 .",
    "taking the derivative of the entropy with respect to the volume and keeping the aspect ratio @xmath32 constant , one finds to leading order in the density @xmath33 note that the pressure curve exhibits a square root singularity as one approaches @xmath17 from below .",
    "the singularity at @xmath17 does not signify a phase transition in the usual sense as it is not a collective phenomenon .",
    "in fact , the singularity exists even for finite @xmath0 and it explicitly shows up in the second term of the virial expansion .",
    "this is different from the usual liquid - solid transition in the bulk , which is obtained only after summing over all orders of that expansion .",
    "the singularity in the narrow channel is a consequence of the fact that the available volume for the disks is a singular function of the control parameter @xmath28 at @xmath17 .",
    "higher order terms in the virial expansion are expected to exhibit a singularity at other integer channel widths , @xmath34 .",
    "thus singularities in the pressure are expected to show up at these widths at higher densities .",
    "we now turn to the evaluation of the collision frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the virial expression for the pressure , appropriately modified for two - dimensional hard disks , is given by @xcite @xmath36 where the sum is over all collisions taking place during the time interval @xmath37 . here",
    ", the relative position vector of two colliding particles @xmath38 and @xmath39 at the time of the collision , @xmath40 , satisfies @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the corresponding relative pre - collision velocity .",
    "this may be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the average momentum transfer in a collision . for a large aspect ratio @xmath45 the collision frequency",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the pair distribution function . at contact , @xmath48 , and in the low - density limit",
    "one has @xmath49 . combining this result with the eqs .",
    "( [ compressionfactor ] ) and ( [ delp ] ) , one finds for the average momentum transfer @xmath50 this expression may also be derived directly from the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution .",
    "it is expected to hold also for narrow channels .",
    "the reason is that in the narrow channel the velocity distribution is still isotropic and is given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( see section [ ns ] ) .",
    "therefore , one can use eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) , together with eq .",
    "( [ delp ] ) , to obtain the collision frequency for narrow channels : @xmath51 this expression is valid both below and above @xmath17 .",
    "it is expected that in such a highly anisotropic system the pressure tensor is not isotropic . in the low - density limit",
    "one can evaluate the diagonal components of the pressure tensor , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , using again the expression for the entropy in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) .",
    "one finds @xmath54 furthermore , one has @xmath55 and , hence , @xmath56 .",
    "it is evident that in the low - density limit the pressure tensor is isotropic for @xmath23 .",
    "it becomes anisotropic for @xmath57 . at higher densities",
    "the two pressure - tensor components differ even above @xmath17 ( see section [ hd ] ) .",
    "the square - root singularity of the total pressure @xmath26 at @xmath17 originates from @xmath53 .",
    "the other component , @xmath52 , exhibits a weaker singularity .",
    "here we carry out numerical simulations for the computaton of the pressure , the collision frequency and the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the pressure is evaluated from the impulsive version of the virial theorem eq .",
    "( [ virial ] ) @xcite .",
    "the collision frequency of a single particle , @xmath35 , is obtained from the total number of collisions per unit time , divided by @xmath58 . for the lyapunov spectrum we use the algorithm outlined in refs . @xcite and @xcite . for the _ periodic_-boundary case",
    "the linear momentum is conserved both in @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions , and , as expected , altogether 6 lyapunov exponents vanish due to the conservation of energy , momentum , center of mass ( only in tangent space ) , and the regularity of the dynamics in the phase - flow direction . for the _",
    "partly - reflecting _ boundary case only four of the exponents vanish due to a lack of momentum and center - of - mass conservation in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , @xmath59 , which measures the rate of information gain on the initial conditions due to the time - reversible dynamics , is given by the sum of the positive exponents@xcite .",
    "since its dependence on the channel width is qualitatively similar to that of the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath60 we concentrate on the latter in the following .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we compare the theoretical curves for the pressure and collision frequency , eqs .",
    "( [ compressionfactor ] ) , ( [ pvkt ] ) and ( [ cf ] ) , with the numerical results . in this low - density regime",
    "an excellent agreement is obtained .",
    "also shown in this figures is the channel - width dependence of the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "it shows a shoulder at the critical width @xmath61 .",
    "the tangent - space perturbation associated with @xmath60 has been shown to be localized in space @xcite .",
    "this exponent is closely connected to the collision frequency and , as a consequence , has a similar qualitative behavior .",
    "this is particularly pronounced in the high density regime as dealt with in the next section .    in fig .",
    "[ pxx_20_0.01 ] we compare the theoretical curves for the pressure - tensor components @xmath52 and @xmath53 with computer simulations for a density @xmath62 and find excellent agreement .",
    "as noted above , it is evident that the square - root singularity of @xmath26 originates from @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the narrow - channel regime , @xmath63 , the velocity distribution is still isotropic and is given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution as is shown in fig .",
    "this supports the use of eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) for the average momentum transfer at a collision even for @xmath63 .",
    "the singular behavior of the pressure is due to a sharp increase of the collision frequency as one approaches @xmath17 from below . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the maximum lyapunov exponent is reminiscent of this singularity as it is closely related to the collision frequency . at this low density",
    "this singularity is not clearly pronounced .",
    "however as will be shown below , at high densities the existence of a cusp at @xmath17 is evident .",
    "the increase of the collision frequency is due to arresting configurations in which a pair of disks become trapped due to the boundaries .",
    "for hard - disk systems at high density one has to rely only on numerical simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig_0.4 ] we present the pressure , the collision frquency and the maximum lyapunov exponent as a function of @xmath28 at a density @xmath64 .",
    "it is observed that the singularity taking place at @xmath17 persists at high density in all three curves . according to eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) the curves for the collision freuqency and for @xmath65 are proportional with a propertionailty constant independent of the density .",
    "this is evidently confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig_0.4 ] . for the special case of only @xmath66 particles in a square periodic box",
    ", the singularity at @xmath17 appears at the critical density @xmath67 and has recently been observed @xcite .",
    "when the density is increased beyond 0.5 , a broad peak emerges at some @xmath68 in the curves for the pressure and the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "this feature is attributed to the    pronounced short - range crystalline - like order which is induced by the narrow - channel boundary conditions .",
    "note that this order is not the natural triangular lattice of the system in the bulk .",
    "a typical microscopic configuration corresponding to this structure for a density 0.9 and @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "[ structure_0.9 ] .",
    "the particles are arrested and can not travel across the system , which has been referred to as the localized regime @xcite .",
    "we have computed also the two pressure - tensor components @xmath52 and @xmath53 for a system with a density @xmath70 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pxx_20_0.8 ] , the two components are significantly different both above and below @xmath71 .",
    "the singularity of the pressure at @xmath17 is evidently caused by @xmath53 , as is also the case for low densities .",
    "all the examples so far are for the case of periodic boundaries in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "a qualitatively similar result is obtained , if the long sides of the channel are elastically reflective , whereas the short sides remain periodic .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath72 particles at a density of @xmath73 , where @xmath26 , @xmath60 and @xmath74 are shown as a function of the box width @xmath28 .",
    "the maxima are not as sharp as in fig .",
    "[ fig_0.4 ] for the periodic case , but are as pronounced .    in order to get some insight into the dynamics of such systems it is usually useful to study the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is well known that this coefficient does not exist in two - dimensional systems in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to compute the mean - squared displacement for a _",
    "finite _ system and to extract effective diffusion constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 in @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions , respectively .",
    "they are obtained from fits to the    linear growth of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for times @xmath79 .",
    "the results for a density @xmath70 are shown in figure [ diffusion ] . as expected @xmath75 vanishes for @xmath63 , while @xmath76 is non - zero .",
    "in fact , @xmath76 increases with @xmath28 approaching unity as a result of the periodic - boundary restrictions disfavoring momentum exchange in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "another intersting feature of fig . [ diffusion ] is the vanishing of @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath80 .",
    "this is due solid - like triangular configurations characteristic of the bulk at this high density .",
    "in fig . [ spectrum ] we plot the lyapunov spectra for a 100-disk system in a narrow periodic box .",
    "all spectra are for a density @xmath64 , which corresponds to a fluid .",
    "since the volume , @xmath81 , is fixed , an increase of the channel width @xmath28 , varied in the figure in steps of 0.4 , decreases @xmath82 accordingly .",
    "@xmath28 is indicated by the labels .",
    "each spectrum consists of @xmath83 lyapunov exponents , of which only the positive branch , @xmath84 , is shown .",
    "the spectra are only defined for integer values of the index , @xmath85 , which labels the exponents according to size .",
    "the lines are only drawn for clarity . according to the equilibrium formulation of the conjugate - pairing rule ,",
    "the negative branch of the spectra , @xmath86 , is the mirror image of the positive branch @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] provides a magnified view of the small exponents .",
    "they turn out to be degenerate , which gives rise to a step - like appearance of the spectra @xcite .",
    "the tangent - space perturbations associated with these exponents are collective , wave - like fields defined over the simulation box , and are referred to as lyapunov modes @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity is determined by the intrinsic symmetries of the hamiltonian and the boundary conditions , which give rise to the conserved quantities , energy and momentum .",
    "a complete classification in terms of transverse ( t ) , longitudinal ( l ) , and momentum ( p ) modes is given in ref .",
    "theoretical attempts have been made to interpret the modes in terms of fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "we observe that a particular exponent , say the smallest positive , increases with @xmath28 and , hence , with the wave number , @xmath87 , belonging to this mode .",
    "this is referred to as a `` dispersion relation '' @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath88 increases monotonously with @xmath28 .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] shows , this proportionality does not hold for the large exponents .",
    "there is a crossover of the spectra reversing the sequence of @xmath89 near @xmath17 .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of the collision frequency .",
    "the perturbations for the large exponents are found to be localized in space with only a small fraction of the particles contributing to the large exponents at any instant of time .",
    "the active zone moves around in space , restoring homogeneity on average .",
    "the smooth lines in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_0.9 ] show lyapunov spectra for analogous 100-disk systems for a density @xmath90 , where the channel width is indicated by the labels .",
    "the case @xmath69 corresponds to the arrested structure of fig .",
    "[ structure_0.9 ] and is of particular interest . in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_0.9 ] we compare it with the dash - dotted spectrum of @xmath91 disks in a periodic channel with an aspect ratio @xmath92 . for @xmath93 and @xmath94 ,",
    "the density is @xmath95 , and the particles form a triangular lattice characteristic of a solid in the bulk . although the nearest neighbor separations and , hence , the collision frequencies , are nearly the same for both systems , the lyapunov spectra are distinctly different .",
    "the maximum exponent , @xmath60 , for the arrested structure is significantly larger than for the triangular system , whereas the behavior of the smaller exponents is just the reverse .",
    "this example demonstrates that the lyapunov spectra are sensitive to structural details and are potentially a useful tool .",
    "but it is fair to say that no theory exists at present to interpret such spectra in full detail .",
    "in this work the thermodynamic and dynamical behaviour of hard disks in a narrow channel is analysed using analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "the main results are for periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "related studies of reflecting boundaries parallel to the channel axis reveal that similar features exist there as well .",
    "it is found that the pressure , collision frequency , maximum lyapunov exponent , and kolmogorov - sinai entropy curves exhibit a singularity for a channel width equal to twice the disk diameter . for low densities this singularity for @xmath26 and @xmath35",
    "is well understood by a virial expansion as it already shows up in the second virial coefficient .",
    "the singularity is not the result of a collective behavior and , in fact , is present for systems with a finite number of particles .",
    "thus , it is not a genuine phase transition .",
    "it is rather a result of a rapid change in the available phase space taking place close to @xmath17 .",
    "similar but less pronounced singularities are expected to show up at @xmath96 and larger integers at higher virial coefficients .",
    "the singularity for the maximum exponent and for the ks - entropy is most pronounced for higher densities .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that these quantities are closely related to the collision frequency @xcite .",
    "it has been established that in bulk systems these quantities exhibit a maximum at a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the maximum lyapunov exponent is a measure of the fastest dynamical events taking place in a system which are localized processes in space @xcite .",
    "thus , its behavior near the transition point is not related to a diverging length scale at the transition .",
    "whereas in an ordinary phase transition in the bulk the enhanced collision frequency - and , thus , of @xmath60 - is due to the emergence of a new structure , here it is a consequence of the constraints imposed by the boundaries .",
    "we expect the singularity found for @xmath17 to be present also for soft disks . in this case , however , the singularity is likely to be weaker than the square - root singularity found in the pressure curve of hard disks .",
    "similar features found in the present study should be present in three - dimensional channels as well",
