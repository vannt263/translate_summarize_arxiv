    "over the past decade , much attention has been given to the mr dampers for its attractive characteristics in applications of civil engineering structures including earth - quake hazard mitigation , or high strength , insensitivity to contamination , and small power requirement .",
    "also mr fluids have attracted considerable interest due to their wide range of use in vibration dampers for vehicle suspension systems or machinery mounts , their stiffness and damping , characteristics can be adjusted very quickly by applying a suitable electric or magnetic field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the magnetorheological response of mr fluids results from the polarization induced in the suspended particles by application of an external field .",
    "the interaction between the resulting induced dipoles causes the particles to form columnar structures , parallel to the applied field .",
    "these chain - like structures restrict the motion of the fluid , thereby increasing the viscous characteristics of the suspension .",
    "the mechanical energy needed to yield these chain - like structures increases as the applied field increases resulting in a field dependent yield stress @xcite .",
    "dynamic constitutive relation of mr fluids is very complicated and provided damping force is intrinsically nonlinear , so there is not a consistent recognized mechanical model for mr dampers . the mechanical model for an mr damper is often established through optimization method according to experimental data @xcite-@xcite . at present , there is a variety of dynamic models for mr dampers .",
    "some models which are simple can not effectively simulate nonlinear dynamic characteristics of mr dampers .",
    "although there are some models which can simulate nonlinear dynamic characteristics , they are established by strong nonlinear equations having a lot of parameters which result in complicated numerical calculation . in civil engineering bingham model",
    "are often used for emulating the dynamic behavior of mr dampers .",
    "this model is one of the most popular models have been widely used with reasonable accuracy and computational cost .",
    "the so - called bingham model includes a variable rigid perfectly plastic element connected in parallel to a newtonian viscosity element .",
    "this model assumes that the fluid exhibits shear stress proportional to shear rate in the post - yield region and can be expressed as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the shear stress in the fluid , @xmath5 is the yielding shear stress controlled by the applied field @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the post - yield viscosity independent of the applied magnetic field , @xmath8 is the shear strain rate and @xmath9 is the signum function .",
    "that is , the fluid is in a state of rest and behaves viscoelastically until the shear stress is greater than the critical value @xmath5 , whereas it moves like a newtonian fluid when such a critical value is exceed .",
    "based on this model of the rheological behavior of electrorheological fluids , stanway et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an idealized mechanical system which consists of a coulomb friction element placed in parallel with a viscous damper . in this model , for nonzero piston velocities @xmath10 , the force generated by the device is given by the fluid as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coefficient of the frictional force , which is related to the fluid yield stress , @xmath13 is the damping coefficient , @xmath14 denoting an offset in the force is included to account for the nonzero mean observed in the measured force due to the presence of the accumulator .",
    "we remark that if at any point the velocity of the piston is zero , the force generated in the frictional element is equal to the applied force .",
    "the bingham model accounts for electro- and magneto- rheological fluid behavior beyond the yield point , i.e. for fully developed fluid flow or sufficiently higher shear rates .",
