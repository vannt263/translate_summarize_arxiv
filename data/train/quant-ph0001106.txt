    "we present a quantum algorithm for the satisfiability problem ( and other combinatorial search problems ) that works on the principle of quantum adiabatic evolution .",
    "an @xmath0-bit instance of satisfiability is a formula @xmath1 where each clause @xmath2 is true or false depending on the values of some subset of the bits . for a single clause , involving only a few bits , it is easy to imagine constructing a quantum device that evolves to a state that encodes the satisfying assignments of the clause .",
    "the real difficulty , of course , lies in constructing a device that produces an assignment that satisfies all @xmath3  clauses .",
    "our algorithm is specified by an initial state in an @xmath0-qubit hilbert space and a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath4 that governs the state s evolution according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath5 where each @xmath6 depends only on clause @xmath2 and acts only on the bits in @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath4 is defined for @xmath7 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 and is slowly varying .",
    "the initial state , which is always the same and easy to construct , is the ground state of @xmath10 . for each  @xmath11 , the ground state of @xmath12 encodes the satisfying assignments of clause  @xmath2 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath13 encodes the satisfying assignments of the intersection of all the clauses . according to the adiabatic theorem , if the evolution time  @xmath9 is big enough , the state of the system at time  @xmath9 will be very close to the ground state of @xmath13 , thus producing the desired solution . for this algorithm to be considered successful",
    "we require that @xmath9 grow only polynomially in  @xmath0 , the number of bits . in this paper",
    "we analyze three examples where @xmath9 grows only polynomially in  @xmath0 .",
    "we are unable to estimate the required running time  @xmath9 in general .    the quantum adiabatic evolution that we are using",
    "should not be confused with cooling .",
    "for example , simulated annealing is a classical algorithm that attempts to find the lowest energy configuration of what we have called @xmath13 by generating the stochastic distribution proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the inverse temperature , and gradually lowering the temperature to zero .",
    "in contrast , quantum adiabatic evolution forces the state of the system to remain in the ground state of the slowly varying  @xmath4 .    in section  [ sec:1 ]",
    "we present the building blocks of our algorithm in detail .",
    "this includes some discussion of the adiabatic theorem and level crossings . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we illustrate the method on a small example that has three clauses , each acting on 2  bits .",
    "each 2-bit clause has more than one satisfying assignment but adiabatic evolution using @xmath4 of the form ( [ eq:0.2 ] ) produces the unique common satisfying assignment . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we look at examples that grow with the number of bits in order to study the dependence of the required running time on the number of bits .",
    "we give three examples of 2-sat problems , each of which has a regular structure , which allows us to analyze the quantum evolution . in these three cases the required evolution time  @xmath9 is only polynomially big in the number of bits .",
    "we also look at a version of the grover problem that can be viewed as a relativized satisfiability problem . in this case",
    "our algorithm requires exponential time to produce a solution .",
    "this had to be so , as explained in section  [ sec : grover ] .    in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we show that our algorithm can be recast within the conventional paradigm of quantum computing , involving sequences of few - bit unitary operators .",
    "in this section we present a quantum algorithm for solving satisfiability problems .",
    "a quantum system evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xmath16 and the adiabatic theorem0 tells us how to follow this evolution in the case that @xmath4 is slowly varying .",
    "consider a smooth one - parameter family of hamiltonians @xmath17 , and take @xmath18 so that @xmath9 controls the rate at which @xmath4 varies .",
    "define the instantaneous eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath19 by @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "suppose @xmath23 is the ground state of @xmath24 , that is , @xmath25 according to the adiabatic theorem , if the gap between the two lowest levels , @xmath26 , is strictly greater than zero for all @xmath27 , then @xmath28    this means that the existence of a nonzero gap guarantees that @xmath29 obeying ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) remains very close to the instantaneous ground state of @xmath4 of the form ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) for all @xmath7 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 if @xmath9 is big enough .",
    "let us define the minimum gap by @xmath30 a closer look at the adiabatic theorem tells us that taking @xmath31 where @xmath32 can make @xmath33 arbitrarily close to  1 .",
    "for all of the problems that we study @xmath34 is of order a typical eigenvalue of @xmath35 and is not too big , so the size of @xmath9 is governed by @xmath36 .",
    "many computationally interesting problems can be recast into an equivalent problem of finding a variable assignment that minimizes an  energy \" function . as a specific example , consider 3-sat .",
    "an @xmath0-bit instance of 3-sat is a boolean formula , ( [ eq:0.1 ] ) , that is specified by a collection of boolean clauses , each of which involves ( at most ) 3 of the @xmath0 bits .",
    "each bit @xmath37 can take the value @xmath8 or @xmath38 and the @xmath39 label runs from @xmath38 to @xmath0 .",
    "clause @xmath40 is associated with the 3 bits labeled @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . for each clause",
    "@xmath40 we define an energy function @xmath43 we then define the total energy @xmath44 as the sum of the individual @xmath45 s , @xmath46 clearly @xmath47 and @xmath48 if and only if   @xmath49 satisfies all of the clauses . thus finding",
    "the minimum energy configuration of @xmath44 tells us if the formula has a satisfying assignment .",
    "we will not distinguish between conventional clauses , which compute the or function of each constituent variable or negated variable , and generalized clauses , which are permitted to compute an arbitrary boolean function of the constituent variables .",
    "in some of our examples it will be more convenient to consider generalized clauses .",
    "if we go from classical to quantum computation we replace the bit @xmath37 by a spin-@xmath51 qubit labeled by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the states @xmath54 are eigenstates of the @xmath55 component of the @xmath39-th spin , @xmath56 so @xmath57 the hilbert space is spanned by the @xmath58 basis vectors @xmath59 .",
    "clause @xmath40 is now associated with the operator @xmath60 , @xmath61 the hamiltonian associated with all of the clauses , which we call @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the sum of hamiltonians each of which acts on a fixed number of bits . by construction ,",
    "@xmath62 is nonnegative , that is , @xmath64 for all @xmath65 and @xmath66 if and only if   @xmath65 is a superposition of states of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 satisfy all of the clauses . in this context , solving a 3-sat problem is equivalent to finding the ground state of a hamiltonian .",
    "clearly many other computationally interesting problems can be recast in this form .      for a given problem ,",
    "specifying @xmath62 is straightforward but finding its ground state may be difficult .",
    "we now consider an @xmath0-bit hamiltonian @xmath69 that is also straightforward to construct but whose ground state is simple to find .",
    "let @xmath70 be the 1-bit hamiltonian acting on the @xmath39-th bit @xmath71 so @xmath72 continuing to take 3-sat as our working example , clause  @xmath40 is associated with the bits @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath42 .",
    "now define @xmath75 and @xmath76 the ground state of @xmath69 is @xmath77 .",
    "this state , written in the @xmath55  basis , is a superposition of all @xmath78 basis vectors @xmath67 , @xmath79 note that we can also write @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of clauses in which bit  @xmath39 appears in the instance of 3-sat being considered .",
    "the key feature of @xmath69 is that its ground state is easy to construct .",
    "the choice we made here will lead to an @xmath4 that is of the form ( [ eq:0.2 ] ) , that is , a sum of hamiltonians associated with each clause",
    ".      we will now use adiabatic evolution to go from the known ground state of @xmath69 to the unknown ground state of @xmath62 .",
    "assume for now that the ground state of @xmath62 is unique .",
    "consider @xmath82 so from ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) , @xmath83 prepare the system so that it begins at @xmath84 in the ground state of @xmath85 . according to the adiabatic theorem , if @xmath86 is not zero and the system evolves according to ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , then for @xmath9 big enough @xmath87 will be very close to the ground state of @xmath62 , that is , the solution to the computational problem .    using the explicit form of",
    "( [ eq:1.14 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.20 ] ) we see that @xmath4 and @xmath88 are sums of individual terms associated with each clause . for each clause @xmath40",
    "let @xmath89 and accordingly @xmath90 then we have @xmath91 and @xmath92 this gives the explicit form of @xmath4 described in the introduction as a sum of hamiltonians associated with individual clauses .",
    "typically @xmath86 is not zero . to see this , note from ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) that vanishing @xmath86 is equivalent to there being some value of  @xmath93 for which @xmath94 . consider a general @xmath95 hamiltonian whose coefficients are functions of  @xmath93 @xmath96 where @xmath11 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are all real .",
    "the two eigenvalues of this matrix are equal for some  @xmath93 if and only if   @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . the curve @xmath103 in @xmath104 will typically not intersect the line @xmath105 unless the hamiltonian has special symmetry properties .",
    "for example , suppose the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1.20 ] ) commutes with some operator , say for concreteness @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that @xmath100 and @xmath102 .",
    "now for the two eigenvalues to be equal at some @xmath93 we only require @xmath98 to vanish at some @xmath93 .",
    "as @xmath93 varies from 0 to 1 it would not be surprising to find @xmath107 cross zero so we see that the existence of a symmetry , that is , an operator which commutes with the hamiltonian makes level crossing more commonplace .",
    "these arguments can be generalized to @xmath108 hamiltonians and we conclude that in the absence of symmetry , levels typically do not cross",
    ". we will expand on this point after we do some examples .    in order for our method to be conceivably useful ,",
    "it is not enough for @xmath86 to be nonzero .",
    "we must be sure that @xmath86 is not so small that the evolution time  @xmath9 is impractically large ; see ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) . for an @xmath0-bit problem",
    "we would say that adiabatic evolution can be used to solve the problem if @xmath9 is less than @xmath109 for some fixed  @xmath110 whereas the method does not work if @xmath9 is of order @xmath111 for some @xmath112 .",
    "returning to ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) we see that the required running time @xmath9 also depends on @xmath34 given in ( [ eq:1.9new ] ) . using ( [ eq:1.19 ] )",
    "we have @xmath113 .",
    "therefore @xmath34 can be no larger than the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath114 . from ( [ eq:1.14 ] )",
    "we see that the spectrum of @xmath62 is contained in @xmath115 where @xmath3 is the number of terms in ( [ eq:1.14 ] ) , that is , the number of clauses in the problem . from ( [ eq:2.21 ] )",
    "we see that the spectrum of @xmath69 is contained in @xmath116 where @xmath117 . for 3-sat ,",
    "@xmath99 is no bigger than @xmath118 .",
    "we are interested in problems for which the number of clauses grows only as a polynomial in @xmath0 , the number of bits .",
    "thus @xmath34 grows at most like a polynomial in @xmath0 and the distinction between polynomial and exponential running time depends entirely on @xmath86 .",
    "we make no claims about the size of @xmath86 for any problems other than the examples given in section  [ sec:3 ] . we will give three examples where @xmath86 is of order @xmath119 so the evolution time  @xmath9 is polynomial in  @xmath0 .",
    "each of these problems has a regular structure that made calculating @xmath86 possible .",
    "however , the regularity of these problems also makes them classically computationally simple . the question of whether there are computationally difficult problems that could be solved by quantum adiabatic evolution we must leave to future investigation .",
    "we have presented a general quantum algorithm for solving sat problems .",
    "it consists of :    1 .",
    "an easily constructible initial state ( [ eq:1.18new ] ) , which is the ground state of @xmath69 in  ( [ eq:2.20 ] ) .",
    "2 .   a time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath4 , given by ( [ eq:1.18 ] ) that is easily constructible from the given instance of the problem ; see ( [ eq:1.14 ] ) and  ( [ eq:2.20 ] ) .",
    "an evolution time @xmath9 that also appears in ( [ eq:1.18 ] ) .",
    "schrdinger evolution according to ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) for time  @xmath9 .",
    "5 .   the final state @xmath87 that for @xmath9 big enough will be ( very nearly ) the ground state of @xmath62 . 6 .   a measurement of @xmath120 in the state @xmath87 .",
    "the result of this measurement will be a satisfying assignment of formula ( [ eq:0.1 ] ) , if it has one ( or more ) .",
    "if the formula ( [ eq:0.1 ] ) has no satisfying assignment , the result will still minimize the number of violated clauses .",
    "again , the crucial question about this quantum algorithm is how big must  @xmath9 be in order to solve an interesting problem .",
    "it is not clear what the relationship is , if any , between the required size of  @xmath9 and the classical complexity of the underlying problem .",
    "the best we have been able to do is explore examples , which is the main subject of the rest of this paper .",
    "here we give some one- , two- , and three - qubit examples that illustrate some of the ideas of the introduction .",
    "the two - qubit examples have clauses with more than one satisfying assignment and serve as building blocks for the three - qubit example and for the more complicated examples of the next section .",
    "consider a one - bit problem where the single clause is satisfied if and only if@xmath121 .",
    "we then take @xmath122 which has @xmath123 as its ground state . for the beginning hamiltonian we take ( [ eq:2.21 ] ) with @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 the smooth interpolating hamiltonian @xmath88 given by ( [ eq:1.19 ] ) has eigenvalues @xmath127 , which are plotted in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "@xmath128    @xmath129    we see that @xmath86 is not small and we could adiabatically evolve from @xmath130 to @xmath123 with a modest value of  @xmath9 .    at this point",
    "we can illustrate why we picked the beginning hamiltonian , @xmath69 , to be diagonal in a basis that is _ not _ the basis that diagonalizes the final problem hamiltonian  @xmath62 .",
    "suppose we replace @xmath69 by @xmath131 @xmath132 keeping @xmath62 as in ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) .",
    "now @xmath88 is diagonal in the @xmath55-basis for all values of  @xmath93 .",
    "the two eigenvalues are  @xmath93 and  @xmath133 , which are plotted in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "the levels cross so @xmath86 is zero .",
    "in fact there is a symmetry , @xmath88 commutes with @xmath134 for all  @xmath93 , so the appearance of the level cross is not surprising .",
    "adiabatically evolving , starting at @xmath135 , we would end up at @xmath135 , which is _ not _ the ground state of  @xmath62 .",
    "however , if we add to @xmath69 any small term that is not diagonal in the @xmath55 basis , we break the symmetry , and @xmath136 will have a nonzero gap for all  @xmath93 .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian @xmath137   { { \\epsilon}}(1-s ) & 1-s\\end{bmatrix}\\ ] ] has @xmath138 for @xmath139 small and the eigenvalues are plotted in fig.[fig:3 ] for a small value of  @xmath139 .",
    "this `` level repulsion '' is typically seen in more complicated systems whereas level crossing is not .",
    "@xmath140      a simple two - qubit example has a single two - bit clause that allows the bit values @xmath141 and @xmath142 but not @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we call this clause `` 2-bit disagree . ''",
    "we take @xmath69 of the form ( [ eq:2.21 ] ) with @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and we take @xmath62 of the form ( [ eq:1.14 ] ) with the single 2-bit disagree clause .",
    "the instantaneous eigenvalues of @xmath88 of the form ( [ eq:1.19 ] ) are shown in fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "there are two ground states of @xmath62 ,    @xmath147    @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the starting state @xmath23 , which is the ground state of @xmath69 , is ( [ eq:1.18new ] ) with @xmath145 .",
    "there is a bit - exchange operation @xmath150 that commutes with @xmath88 .",
    "since the starting state @xmath23 is invariant under the bit - exchange operation , the state corresponding to the @xmath151 end of the lowest level in fig.[fig:4 ] is the symmetric state @xmath152 .",
    "the next level , @xmath153 , begins at the antisymmetric state @xmath154 and ends at the antisymmetric state @xmath155 .",
    "because @xmath136 commutes with the bit - exchange operation there can be no transitions from the symmetric to the antisymmetric states .",
    "therefore the @xmath153 curve in fig.[fig:4 ] is irrelevant to the adiabatic evolution of the ground state and the relevant gap is @xmath156 .",
    "closely related to 2-bit disagree is the `` 2-bit agree clause , '' which has @xmath143 and @xmath144 as satisfying assignments .",
    "we can obtain @xmath62 for this problem by taking @xmath62 for 2-bit disagree and acting with the operator that takes @xmath157 .",
    "note that @xmath158 is invariant under this transformation as is the starting state @xmath23 given in ( [ eq:1.18new ] ) .",
    "this implies that the levels of @xmath88 corresponding to 2-bit agree are the same as those for 2-bit disagree and that beginning with the ground state of @xmath69 , adiabatic evolution brings you to @xmath159 .",
    "another two - bit example that we will use later is the clause `` imply '' . here",
    "the satisfying assignments are @xmath143 , @xmath141 , and @xmath144 .",
    "the relevant level diagram is shown in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "@xmath160      next we present a three - bit example that is built up from two - bit clauses so we have an instance of 2-sat with three bits .",
    "we take the 2-bit imply clause acting on bits 1 and  2 , the 2-bit disagree clause acting on bits 1 and  3 , and the 2-bit agree clause acting on bits 2 and  3 .",
    "although each two - bit clause has more than one satisfying assignment , the full problem has the unique satisfying assignment  @xmath161 .",
    "the corresponding quantum hamiltonian , @xmath162 , we write as the sum of hamiltonians each of which acts on two bits , @xmath163   h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}&= ( h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}^{(1 ) } + h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}^{(2 ) } ) +   ( h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}^{(1 ) } + h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}^{(3 ) } ) +   ( h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}^{(2 ) } + h_{{\\mathrm{b}}}^{(3 ) } ) \\ .\\label{eq:3.5add}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of @xmath88 are shown in  fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "@xmath164    we see that @xmath86 is not zero . starting in the ground state of @xmath69 , and evolving according to ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) with @xmath165",
    "the system will end up in the ground state of @xmath62 for @xmath166 .",
    "this example illustrates how our algorithm evolves to the unique satisfying assignment of several overlapping clauses even when each separate clause has more than one satisfying assignment .",
    "the alert reader may have noticed that two of the levels in 6 cross .",
    "this can be understood in terms of a symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath62 of ( [ eq:3.5add ] ) is invariant under the unitary transformation @xmath167 , as is @xmath69 .",
    "now the three states with energy equal to 4 at @xmath168 are @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 .",
    "the transformation @xmath172 in the @xmath173 basis is @xmath174 , so the states @xmath175 are invariant under @xmath176 , whereas @xmath177 goes to minus itself .",
    "we call these two different transformation properties `` invariant '' and `` odd '' .",
    "thus at @xmath168 there are two invariant states and one odd state with energy  4 .",
    "we see from 6 that one combination of these states ends up at energy 2 when @xmath151 .",
    "the energy-2 state at @xmath151 is @xmath178 , which is invariant so the level moving across from energy 4 to energy 2 is invariant .",
    "this means that one of the two levels that start at energy 4 and end at energy 1 is invariant and the other is odd .",
    "since the hilbert space can be decomposed into a direct sum of the invariant and odd subspaces and accordingly @xmath4 is block diagonal , the invariant and odd states are decoupled , and their crossing is not an unlikely occurrence .    since ,",
    "in this simple 3-bit example , we do see levels cross you may wonder if we should expect to sometimes see the two lowest levels cross in more complicated examples .",
    "we now argue that we do not expect this to happen and even if it does occur it will not effect the evolution of the ground state .",
    "first note that the transformation which is a symmetry of ( [ eq:3.5add ] ) is not a symmetry of the individual terms in the sum .",
    "thus it is unlikely that such symmetries will typically be present in more complicated @xmath0-bit examples .",
    "however , it is inevitable that certain instances of problems will give rise to hamiltonians that are invariant under some transformation .",
    "imagine that the transformation consists of bit interchange and negation ( in the @xmath55 basis ) as in the example just discussed .",
    "then the starting state @xmath179 given by ( [ eq:1.18new ] ) is invariant .",
    "assume that @xmath62 has a unique ground state @xmath180 .",
    "since @xmath62 is invariant this state must transform into itself , up to a phase .",
    "however , from the explicit form of the ground state we see that it transforms without a phase , that is , it is invariant .",
    "thus , following the evolution of the ground state we can restrict our attention to invariant states .",
    "the gap that matters is the smallest energy difference between the two lowest invariant states .",
    "here we discuss four examples of @xmath0-bit instances of satisfiability . in three of the examples",
    "the problems are classically computationally simple to solve .",
    "these problems also have structure that we exploit to calculate @xmath86 in the corresponding quantum version . in each case",
    "@xmath86 goes like @xmath119 , so these problems can be solved in polynomial time by adiabatic quantum evolution .",
    "the other example is the `` grover problem''1 , which has a single ( generalized ) @xmath0-bit clause with a unique satisfying assignment .",
    "if we assume that we treat the clause as an oracle , which may be queried but not analyzed , it takes @xmath78 classical queries to find the satisfying assignment .",
    "our quantum version has @xmath86 of order @xmath181 , so the time required for quantum adiabatic evolution scales like @xmath78 , which means that there is no quantum speedup .",
    "nonetheless , it is instructive to see how it is possible to evaluate  @xmath86 for the grover problem .      [",
    "sec : ring ] consider an @xmath0-bit problem with @xmath0 clauses , each of which acts only on adjacent bits , that is , clause @xmath182 acts on bits @xmath183 and @xmath184 where @xmath183 runs from 1 to  @xmath0 and bit @xmath185 is identified with bit  @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore we restrict each clause to be either `` agree '' , which means that @xmath143 and @xmath144 are satisfying assignments or `` disagree '' , which means that @xmath141 and @xmath142 are satisfying assignments .",
    "suppose there are an even number of disagree clauses so that a satisfying assignment on the ring exists .",
    "clearly given the list of clauses it is trivial to construct the satisfying assignment . also , if @xmath186 is a satisfying assignment , so is @xmath187 , so there are always exactly two satisfying assignments .",
    "the quantum version of the problem has @xmath188 where each @xmath182 is either agree or disagree .",
    "the ground states of @xmath62 are @xmath189 and @xmath190 all in the @xmath55 basis .",

    "@xmath69 is invariant under the transformation just given .",
    "this implies that the spectrum of @xmath195 , with @xmath62 given by ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) , is identical to the spectrum of @xmath136 with @xmath62 given by ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) .",
