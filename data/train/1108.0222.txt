    "the search for the higgs boson continues to be of paramount importance to complete our understanding of the standard model . in the last few years",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron have ruled out a mass window for the sm higgs boson in the range @xmath0  gev @xcite .",
    "the lhc has now joined the search for the higgs boson , and relying on the @xmath1 mode , the atlas and cms collaborations expect to either discover or exclude a standard model with three generations ( sm3 ) higgs boson in a wide mass range . up to now , for sm3 , a higgs boson with a mass in the ranges @xmath2 and @xmath3  gev has been ruled out at 95% c.l . by atlas @xcite , and in the ranges @xmath4 gev and @xmath5 gev by cms @xcite . with a fourth generation ( sm4 )",
    ", cms has ruled out the higgs boson mass in the range of @xcite @xmath6 gev at the 95% c.l .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for the sm3 higgs boson at the lhc is gluon fusion @xcite through a top - quark loop .",
    "this mechanism is very sensitive to new physics : for example , with a fourth generation ( sm4 ) , the amplitude is roughly 3 times larger as it simply counts the number of heavy flavors in the loop .",
    "this results in a significantly larger cross - section for higgs boson production , about 9 times larger than in sm3 @xcite .",
    "this observation , combined with the higgs search results from the lhc this year and expected from future , places a considerable strain on the possibility of a fourth generation .",
    "if the higgs boson is indeed discovered with a production cross - section roughly in agreement with the sm , one would have to explain why the factor of 9 enhancement present in sm4 is not there . on the other hand , if the higgs boson is not observed , its exclusion is even more significant in sm4 , and its allowed mass is pushed towards the unitarity bound",
    ". a possible way out of this predicament that has been discussed for sm4 is that it may be more natural to have a heavy higgs if indeed there are four generations @xcite .    in this note",
    "we consider the possibility of extended scalar sectors that could remove the tension between higgs physics at the lhc and a heavy fourth generation .",
    "we discuss two possibilities : a scalar sector extended with a color octet , electroweak doublet @xcite ; and a variation of the two - higgs doublet model `` for the top '' @xcite . in the first case",
    "we argue that it is possible to suppress the higgs production rate in gluon fusion with suitable additional particles . in the second case",
    "we argue that it is possible to make the neutral scalar with sm - higgs - like couplings heavy , or to suppress its production cross - section relative to sm4 .",
    "similar arguments have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to constrain a possible fourth generation in two - higgs doublet models of type ii .",
    "another possibility recently discussed occurs in models where the higgs boson has a larger invisible decay width than that in the sm  @xcite .",
    "we now consider the case of a scalar sector that has been extended with a color octet , electroweak doublet and hypercharge @xmath7 scalar @xmath8 .",
    "this particular choice is motivated by the requirement of minimal flavor violation and has been recently elaborated in ref .",
    "it was noted in that paper that in minimal flavor violation only scalars with the same gauge quantum numbers as the sm higgs doublet @xmath9 or color octet scalars with the same weak quantum numbers as the higgs doublet @xmath10 can couple to quarks , a scenario with many interesting collider and flavor physics consequences .",
    "this color octet can be written in a conventionally normalized component form with color index @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "since the new scalars carry color , they may have a significant effect on the two gluon coupling to the sm higgs boson @xmath13 , and thus affect its production at lhc .",
    "the contribution of @xmath14 to the @xmath15 coupling can not happen at the tree level , but occurs at the one loop level by having the color octet @xmath14 in the loop and allowing @xmath13 to couple to @xmath14 from the interactions in the scalar potential .",
    "the most general scalar potential with @xmath16 and @xmath14 is ref.@xcite , @xmath17\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\lambda_6 { \\rm tr } s^{\\dagger i } s_i s^{\\dagger j}s_j + \\lambda_7 { \\rm tr } s^{\\dagger i } s_j s^{\\dagger j}s_i + \\lambda_8 { \\rm tr } s^{\\dagger i } s_i{\\rm tr } s^{\\dagger j}s_j \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\lambda_9 { \\rm tr } s^{\\dagger i } s_j { \\rm tr } s^{\\dagger j}s_i + \\lambda_{10 } { \\rm tr } s_i s_j s^{\\dagger i}s^{\\dagger j } + \\lambda_{11 } { \\rm tr } s_i s_j s^{\\dagger j}s^{\\dagger i}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the additional contribution to the higgs boson production due to the octet - scalar loops has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the limit of very heavy quarks and color scalars in the loop",
    ", the @xmath15 coupling can be obtained form the effective lagrangian@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the usual sm higgs doublet @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the would - be goldstone bosons `` eaten '' by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath13 is the physics higgs field .",
    "@xmath25 is the number of heavy quark flavors , one in the case of sm3 and three in the case of sm4 .",
    "it is clear from the above expression for the @xmath26 coupling that the addition of the color octet scalar doublet has the potential to significantly alter the higgs production cross - section at lhc .",
    "indeed , it was already pointed out in ref",
    ".  @xcite that this cross section could double for @xmath27 , which are consistent with electroweak constraints .",
    "it is equally possible to cancel an enhancement from sm4 in the higgs production cross - section , @xmath28 , with appropriate parameters in the color octet scalar potential . for this cancellation to be possible , we need to check that the required values of @xmath29 are not in conflict with anything else .",
    "there is no constraint from the electroweak parameter @xmath30 ( equivalently from custodial @xmath31 ) on the combination @xmath32 , as long as a third parameter in the potential , @xmath33 , takes the value @xmath34 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath35 to the electroweak parameter @xmath14 is given by @xcite @xmath36    the current best fit value for s parameter and its allowed range , for @xmath37  gev is , @xmath38 @xcite . assuming that @xmath14 is saturated by @xmath35 , the implied range for the combination appearing in eq .",
    "[ effhgg ] is @xmath39 this is enough for a large suppression of sm3 at one sigma level . to sufficiently suppress sm4 , an additional negative contribution from @xmath40 , which is not constrained by @xmath14 ,",
    "is required .",
    "for example , with @xmath41 , a @xmath42 would halve the sm4 coupling .",
    "of course , the color octet scalar can also enhance the higgs production cross section , exacerbating any potential conflict .",
    "another simple extension of the scalar sector of the sm consists of adding a second higgs doublet @xcite . many variations on this theme exist in the literature , but one stands out motivated by the fact that the fourth generation quarks are necessarily much heavier than the lightest five quarks",
    "this suggests that a second higgs doublet is responsible for the masses of the fourth generation quarks ( and possibly the top - quark as well ) , in a variation of the `` for the top - quark '' two higgs doublet model of ref .",
    "the phenomenology of these models and their significance for a heavy fourth generation has been recently emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to implement this model as a solution to the sm4 tension with higgs physics at the lhc , we do not focus on reducing the @xmath26 effective coupling .",
    "we consider instead the observability of @xmath13 including its production and its couplings to @xmath43 pairs as well as its mass .",
    "in essence , we require the higgs with relatively large couplings to @xmath43-pairs either to be outside the accessible mass range , or to have a smaller enhancement over sm3 than what is found in sm4 .    in a generic two higgs doublet model with scalar fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 each has a vev @xmath46 , @xmath47 . assuming that @xmath44 couples to the first three generations and @xmath45 couples to the fourth generation , the yukawa couplings are given by ( we call this model i ) @xmath48 the model can be modified so that the top - quark also couples to @xmath45 , we call this model ii .    after spontaneous symmetry breaking there remain two physical neutral scalars @xmath13 and @xmath16 , a pseudo - scalar @xmath11 , and a charged higgs @xmath21 .",
    "the physical neutral scalars are the ones relevant to our discussion here . in general , the higgs potential parameters mix the neutral real components of the doublets @xmath49 to form the physical neutral scalars @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "we parameterize this mixing by @xmath50 at this point it is worth noting that the parameter space in the higgs potential can accommodate either @xmath13 or @xmath16 as the heavier of the two .",
    "the couplings of @xmath13 and @xmath16 to @xmath43 and @xmath24 bosons are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is presumably large as @xmath47 gives mass to the heavy fourth generation .",

    "the cross - sections for the overall processes , as compared to the sm3 higgs , become ( in the infinite heavy quark mass limit ) are the same in the 2hdm type ii , although the origin of the separate terms is different : the term with the factor of 2 arising from two up - type quarks @xmath61 and the second term arising from the @xmath62 quark . ]",

    "the main difference between this scenario and a heavy higgs in sm4 is that the second , lighter , higgs increases the mass bound allowed by unitarity for the heavy one @xcite .",

    "the @xmath13 couplings to the fermions are also the same as those for the sm4 and @xmath70 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath13 is also the lightest neutral scalar eigenstate , this model is identical to and has the same tension as sm4",
    ". however , in this 2hdm , the mass of @xmath13 can be higher than the mass of the higgs boson of the sm4 .",
    "in particular , generic unitarity bounds for two - higgs doublet models suggest it can be as heavy as @xmath71  gev @xcite and outside the range of current searches . in this scenario , @xmath16 is the lighter higgs boson and can be produced at the lhc , but the search for this object requires a different strategy as it does not couple to @xmath43-pairs , @xmath72 . in figure  [ fig : ratios ] we illustrate this case for model i , eq .  [ ratios ] , on the left plot .",
    "the figure shows that there is a value of @xmath55 where @xmath73 is the same for both higgs bosons , and only 2.25 times larger than it is in sm3 .",
    "as we increase @xmath55 from that point , the ratio @xmath74 increases until it reaches the value of 9 as in sm4 . at the same time the ratio @xmath75 is decreasing being less than half the sm3 value for most of the range .",
    "this illustrates a second way to alleviate the tension , in which the sm - like higgs boson is still enhanced relative to sm3 but by a smaller factor than it is in sm4 .    in the right plot of figure",
    "[ fig : ratios ] we show what happens in model ii ( where the top - quark also couples to @xmath45 ) for @xmath67 . notice that it is not possible to find values of @xmath76 and @xmath52 that simultaneously suppress @xmath75 and @xmath74 in eq .",
    "[ ratios2 ] below one .",
    "however , the enhancement over sm3 can be made as small as 2.25 simultaneously for both neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the figure also shows that one can suppress the lighter neutral higgs below the sm3 value while enhancing the heavier one by factors around 5 , which is still below sm4 .    in summary , in a generic two - higgs doublet model ,",
    "the process @xmath77 will not be able to conclusively rule out a heavy fourth generation unless the search is extended to masses reaching the unitarity bound and the sensitivity to the cross - section reaches values that are close to twice the sm3 cross - section .",
    "the search for the higgs boson at the lhc during the upcoming year will be at odds with the predictions of a heavy fourth generation if the higgs boson is found with a cross - section consistent with sm3 or if the higgs boson is not found at all . in this note",
    "we have examined the possibility of ameliorating this conflict with extended scalar sectors .",
    "there are two possible paths that we illustrate with two examples . in the first example",
    ", an additional color - octet electroweak - doublet can suppress the higgs production cross - section in both sm3 and sm4 .",
    "the details , of course , depend on the parameters in the scalar potential but we have seen that the numbers needed are allowed by other constraints . in the second example we have shown that in a two - higgs doublet model there is sufficient freedom to suppress the higgs cross - section for the lighter neutral higgs , while at the same time the unitarity bounds allow the mass of the heavier higgs boson to be larger than in sm4 , possibly outside the current lhc search range .    this work was supported in part by doe under contract number de - fg02 - 01er41155 .",
