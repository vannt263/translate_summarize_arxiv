    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the properties of a quantum mechanical wave function of very many variables known as the laughlin function @xcite .",
    "it arises as an explanation of a curious and unexpected phenomenon known as the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite .",
    "it is not our intention to discuss the physics of fqhe but rather to discuss the mathematical problems that arise when the laughlin function is appropriately modified for a two - dimensional cylindrical geometry @xcite .",
    "the interesting point here is that although the setup is seemingly translation invariant ( in the direction of the cylinder axis ) the resulting one - particle density @xmath2 is not invariant but has a non - trivial periodicity of length @xmath1 ( in natural units ) , where @xmath1 is an integer related to the so - called `` filling fraction '' .",
    "the main content of this paper is the rigorous verification of this periodicity when the cylinder radius is small compared to the natural length .",
    "the periodicity has a natural interpretation in the context of classical coulomb systems and is manifest in the periodicity of a closely related `` quantum polymer ''  @xcite .",
    "the conjecture of periodicity for all radii remains open .",
    "+ let us just say a few words about the function and why it was proposed .",
    "imagine a hollow circular cylinder in @xmath3 of radius @xmath4 on whose surface @xmath5 electrons reside .",
    "each electron has a coordinate @xmath6 , with @xmath7 denoting the distance parallel to the cylinder axis and @xmath8 denoting the angular coordinate .",
    "we will often use @xmath9 to denote the coordinate instead of @xmath6 .",
    "there is a magnetic field of magnitude @xmath10 perpendicular to the surface . since magnetic fields",
    "must be divergence free we can think of this situation as one in which there is a ( unobserved ) flux through the hollow cylinder that leaks out through the surface with a constant flux through the cylindrical surface on which the electrons reside ( see also  @xcite , sect .",
    "if we pay attention only to the surface the physical situation is translation invariant but if we pay attention to the flux in the hollow core we can measure our @xmath11 coordinate by measuring the total flux in the circular cross section at @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic vector potential , @xmath12 , evaluated on the surface , is given by stokes theorem ( assuming that @xmath12 has no component in the axial direction ) as @xmath13 , which is obviously periodic in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "our vector potential @xmath15 is determined only up to a gauge parametrized by @xmath16 .    with this choice",

    "our operator @xmath22 should be seen as the part of a three - dimensional hamiltonian which acts on the axial and the angular parts of the wave function .",
    "the radial , angular and axial coordinates , the part of the laplacian that we are interested in is @xmath23 .",
    "fixing @xmath24 and choosing @xmath25 , this becomes @xmath26 : the differential symbol is @xmath4-independent . ]",

    "the `` magnetic length '' @xmath27 equals @xmath19 .",
    "an important role will be played by the dimensionless parameter @xmath28    here we come to the crucial point that the usual gauge invariance ( meaning that we can replace @xmath15 by @xmath29 and a wave function @xmath30 by @xmath31 $ ] ) is not generally allowed .",
    "gauge changes @xmath32 have to respect the @xmath33-periodicity in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "consequently , the number @xmath16 in @xmath22 can not be changed by a gauge transformation unless the change is a multiple of @xmath34 .",
    "this lack of complete gauge symmetry is intimately related to the breaking of translational symmetry .",
    "if we translate in the axial direction by @xmath35 then @xmath36 , the hamiltonian  ( [ laugh ] ) with this replacement is generally _ not _ gauge equivalent to the original one . that is , changing @xmath12 by @xmath37 with @xmath38 is not allowed  except for the special cases @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "hence the system possesses a discrete translational symmetry .",
    "the discrete translational invariance and the effect of changing @xmath16 can be nicely read off the eigenfunctions of @xmath22 .",
    "the eigenfunctions belonging to the lowest eigenvalue are all of the form @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is an entire function",
    ". to respect @xmath33 periodicity , the eigenfunction must be a superposition of functions @xmath43",

    "these functions are essentially gaussians of @xmath11 ; their centers form a lattice with spacing @xmath45 , and changing @xmath16 amounts to a uniform shift of the centers . from now on , we set the parameter @xmath16 to @xmath46 .",

    "thus , for a finite cylinder , the dimension of this lowest energy space - known as the lowest landau band - equals the `` number of fluxes '' @xmath49 , i.e. , the total flux @xmath50 divided by the flux quantum @xmath34 ( remember @xmath21 ) .    if there are some number @xmath5 of electrons that repel each other via a coulomb interaction we have to construct a wave function of @xmath5 variables @xmath51 that minimizes the total energy .",
    "the kinetic part is minimal if we choose sums of products of one - particle functions from the lowest landau band . in other words",
    "our wave function must have the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a polynomial in @xmath5 variables of degree at most @xmath49 in each variable separately .",
    "furthermore , the pauli exclusion principle for fermions demands that this polynomial be antisymmetric , i.e. , that it change sign if any two variables are interchanged .",
    "if the particles are bosons , instead , then @xmath53 must be symmetric .",
    "we are interested in the cases that @xmath54 with @xmath55 , in which case we say that the lowest landau band is filled to a fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath56 satisfies all the stated conditions for fermions ( when @xmath1 is odd ) and for bosons ( when @xmath1 is even ) .",
    "later , it will be useful to fix the multiplicative factor @xmath57 as in eq .",
    "( [ multconst : eq ] ) below .",
    "the factor @xmath57 does not affect the one - particle density .",
    "our choice of @xmath57 makes @xmath58 the power of a slater determinant of functions that resemble the lowest landau level basis functions ( see eq .  ( [ powdet : eq ] ) ) , and considerably simplifies subsequent statements on normalization constants .",
    "this function was invented by laughlin @xcite for the disk geometry and later adapted to the cylinder geometry @xcite , and is considered to be a good approximation to the true ground state .",
    "its distinctive feature is that it is small when two particles @xmath59 and @xmath60 are close together , thereby making the interaction energy small .",
    "+ in this article , we analyze the periodicity in the axial direction of the state @xmath61 in the limit @xmath62 for fixed radius @xmath4 and filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "particular emphasis will be put on the one particle density @xmath63^{n-1 } }               \\bigl|\\psi_n ( z , z_2, .. ,z_n)\\bigr|^2 { \\mathrm{d}}y_2 .. { \\mathrm{d}}y_n { \\mathrm{d}}x_2 .. { \\mathrm{d}}x_n,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the @xmath65-norm squared with respect to integration over @xmath66)^n$ ] . notice that we integrate over infinite cylinders but keep referring to @xmath58 as a finite cylinder state .",
    "the reason is that the wave function vanishes exponentially fast outside the finite cylinder . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the wave function is a simple slater determinant of basis functions  ( [ lowl ] ) , the density is a sum of equally weighted gaussians @xmath68 $ ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ density : eq ] ) ) , and changing the domain of integration to a finite cylinder does not affect the density in the middle of the cylinder .",
    "the origin of the analysis of the density s periodicity is an observation for the filled lowest landau level : for @xmath67 , the density is periodic with minimal period @xmath45 .",
    "this contrasts with the constant density of the filled landau level in the symmetric gauge and reflects the discrete translational symmetry of the hamiltonian  ( [ laugh ] ) .",
    "when @xmath69 , laughlin s state does not possess the full discrete symmetry of the hamiltonian  ( [ laugh ] ) any longer , hence the symmetry is broken . however , the state is still periodic , with minimal period @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath1 times the period of the filled landau level .",
    "this is rigorously shown here for cylinders with sufficiently small radius ( large @xmath45 ) ; numerical results @xcite for @xmath71 and @xmath72 suggest that the result actually holds for all values of the cylinder radius .",
    "related , finite  @xmath5 results have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "related considerations for laughlin type functions on tori , introduced in @xcite , can be found in @xcite . in @xcite , the amplitude of oscillations of the density for torus laughlin - type functions",
    "is investigated numerically , as a function of the cylinder radius .",
    "it follows from our results that the density and hence , the amplitude of @xmath73-oscillations , are analytic function of @xmath45 when @xmath45 is sufficiently large .",
    "this implies that the only possibility for the oscillation amplitude to vanish on some small @xmath45 interval is that a phase transition occurs as @xmath45 is decreased , see @xcite for a similar argument .",
    "( with `` phase transition ''",
    "we mean that either there is no longer a well - defined unique thermodynamic limit or there is a unique thermodynamic limit but the density ceases to be analytic at some point . )",
    "@xcite argue that no such phase transition occurs , but a rigorous proof is still lacking .    due to the picture mentioned before , translation along the cylinder axis can be reinterpreted as a change of flux @xmath16 .",
    "one flux unit ( @xmath34 ) corresponds to a translation by one natural length unit ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "hence the many electron system is invariant under a change of @xmath1 flux units . in the picture of laughlin s original article on the integer hall effect @xcite",
    "this corresponds to a transport of one electric charge from one edge to the other of the cylinder for every adiabatic change by @xmath1 flux units .",
    "this is related to a heuristic argument given in @xcite , suggesting that the periodicity is needed in order to reconcile laughlin s iqhe article with fractional quantum hall conductances .",
    "another interpretation of the periodicity is that the @xmath5 particles in a cylinder of length @xmath74 are not arranged randomly but , more like a one - dimensional crystal , they are separated by a distance of @xmath1 units .",
    "this interpretation is of interest from the point of view of laughlin s plasma analogy @xcite : @xmath75 is proportional to the boltzmann weight of a classical jellium system placed on a cylinder ( see also  @xcite , sect .",
    "the factor @xmath76 in the wave function arises from the potential created by a neutralizing background while the polynomial in @xmath77 accounts for the repulsive interaction between charged particles .",
    "one - dimensional jellium systems always display periodicity , i.e. , `` wigner crystallization '' , as was shown in @xcite . for jellium tubes ,",
    "the symmetry breaking is well - known at coupling constant @xmath78 , corresponding to the filled landau level , see @xcite .",
    "the periodicity has been conjectured to hold for other values of the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "our results give a partial proof of this conjecture .",
    "+ our result on the periodicity comes in several parts : a preliminary observation ( lemma  [ foutrans : lem ] ) , holding for all values of @xmath45 , is that the one particle density can never be constant , and if it is periodic , the period must be a multiple of @xmath45 .",
    "theorem  [ thermolim : theo ] , valid for large @xmath45 , states that the laughlin state has a unique thermodynamic limit as @xmath79 , and the limiting state has @xmath70 as one of its periods .",
    "theorem  [ symbreak : theo ] says that @xmath70 is actually the smallest period .",
    "we also prove , for large @xmath45 , that the state is mixing with respect to ( magnetic ) translations along the direction of the cylinder axis ( theorem  [ cluster : theo ] ) .",
    "the crucial idea for the proof of our results is the representation of laughlin s wave function as a `` quantum polymer ''  @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath58 is written as a sum of functions , each associated with a partition of @xmath80 .",
    "one of these functions is the tao - thouless function @xcite , which is the antisymmetrized tensor product of lowest landau band functions centered at multiples of @xmath70 .",
