    "when monovalent chloride salts are dissolved in liquid alcl@xmath4 , ionic liquids with low melting points are formed . when the added cation is inorganic , the system becomes a molten salt , like naalcl@xmath5 with @xmath6  =  152  @xmath7c .@xcite",
    "when it is organic , the system is likely to be liquid below 100  @xmath7c , thus potentially becoming a room temperature ionic liquid ( rtil ) ; for example @xmath6(emialcl@xmath5 )  =  7  @xmath7c @xcite ( where emi@xmath0 stands for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation ) .",
    "a number of investigations using molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for ionic liquids directed at either structure or dynamical properties .",
    "@xcite given the molecular nature of cations or anions forming ionic liquids , earlier molecular dynamics simulations were performed with pairwise additive potentials based on non - polarizable force fields such as opls or amber .",
    "@xcite these simulations have been able to reproduce the structural properties of ionic liquids , for instance showing that a somewhat unusual hydrogen bond can take place in imidazolium based ionic between the imidazolium ring proton and the anion species .",
    "@xcite this observation is in agreement with ir and nmr spectroscopy studies .",
    "@xcite at intermediate spatial range ( 0.5 to 0.8  @xmath8 ) , a chain - length dependent pre - peak appears either in the static structure factor calculated from molecular dynamics trajectories  @xcite or obtained by small wide angle x - ray scattering ( swaxs ) and/or small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) .",
    "@xcite this feature has been assigned to structural segregation or inhomogeneity , i.e. the imidazolium rings and the alkyl chain regions of cations respectively cluster to form polar and apolar domains in ionic liquids where the cations have long alkyl chains .",
    "@xcite despite their capability to reproduce the structure , the non - polarizable force fields often begin to fail when predicting dynamical properties , such as diffusion coefficient , electrical conductivity , and viscosity .",
    "@xcite in general the dynamical properties calculated with non - polarizable models are slower than is observed in experiments : the diffusion coefficient and electrical conductivities are lower while the viscosity is greater than the measured values .",
    "@xcite note that pairwise additive potentials are often parameterised to _ implicitly _ include some aspects of the polarization effects .",
    "for example , the simulated fluid may become less viscous if the magnitudes of the partial charges are reduced ,  @xcite but sometimes at the price of a poorer representation of other properties .",
    "these trends are particularly well - documented in the case of the inorganic systems .",
    "@xcite    disregarding the polarization method used , molecular dynamics simulations of molten salts in which polarization effects are included have shown that the liquids become more mobile .",
    "@xcite moreover , molecular dynamics simulations of ionic liquids including polarization have shown better agreement of dynamical properties with experiment , that is , the simulated liquids are either as mobile as the experimental sample or more mobile than the liquids simulated with non - polarizable model .",
    "@xcite among the studies using a polarizable model for ionic liquids , we would cite the recent and comprehensive work by yan et al ,  @xcite where the authors carefully investigated the role - played by polarization in the ionic liquid emi@xmath9 no@xmath4@xmath10 .",
    "the authors found that when polarization effects are included , the short - range interactions are enhanced due to the additional charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interactions , while long - range electrostatic interactions become more screened . accordingly , the imidazolium ring proton - no@xmath11 hydrogen bond strength is increased upon switching the polarization on .",
    "another consequence of the stronger polar short - range interactions achieved with the polarizable model for the structure is the enhancement of the tendency towards structural inhomogeneity , which acts by pulling the apolar chains away from the polar center and reinforces the assembly of ethyl chain into the apolar domains .",
    "the attenuation of long - range electrostatic interaction is responsible for the increase of diffusion , conductivity and structural relaxation and the reduction of viscosity .    in this work",
    ", we study a series of chloroaluminate liquids .",
    "a particular emphasis is given to the room temperature ionic liquid consisting of an equimolar mixture of emicl with alcl@xmath4 .",
    "we employ two flavors of molecular dynamics simulations , which differ by the method involved for the calculation of the interactions : in the first , they are obtained from a full density functional theory ( dft ) calculation , and in the second an analytical force field ( including polarization effects ) is used .",
    "both methods have already been used successfully for the study of pure alcl@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in a first step we detail how the parameters of the interaction potential for emicl - alcl@xmath4 have been obtained .",
    "the structure and dynamics of this melt are then analyzed and compared to a series of molten salts consisting of equimolar mixtures of alcl@xmath4 with licl , nacl and kcl .",
    "in recent work on the simulation of inorganic ionic systems , interaction potentials that were used commonly included many - body effects such as polarization .",
    "@xcite the most generally retained analytical expression  @xcite is @xmath12 where the three first terms are pairwise additive .",
    "the first term corresponds to the electrostatic interactions , and formal integer charges are used .",
    "the two following terms are expressed by a born - huggins - mayer type potential ; they consist of an exponentially decaying term accounting for the overlap repulsion of the electronic clouds at short distances , and a term which represents the dispersion effects .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole dispersion coefficients ; @xmath15 are tang - toennies dispersion damping functions  @xcite describing the short - range penetration correction to the asymptotic multipole expansion of dispersion .",
    "these functions take the form    @xmath16    where the @xmath17 parameter sets the range of the damping effect .",
    "the polarization term reflects the distortion of the electronic density in response to the electric fields due to all the other ions .",
    "it is written    @xmath18   + \\sum_i ( \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^i } \\mid { \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}^i\\mid^2 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interaction tensors and @xmath21 is the polarizability of ion @xmath22 .",
    "again , tang - toennies functions are included to account for the short - range damping effects :    @xmath23    these functions differ from the previously defined @xmath24 due to the presence of an additional parameter @xmath25 , which measures the strength of the ion response to the short - range effects .",
    "the set of induced dipoles @xmath26}$ ] is treated as @xmath27 additional degrees of freedom of the systems .",
    "the dipoles are determined at each time step by minimization of the total polarization energy and they depend on the positions of all the atoms at the corresponding time ; therefore the polarization part of the potential is a many - body term .    in the case of room - temperature ionic liquids ,",
    "molecular species are involved , and additional intramolecular interactions accounting for covalent bonding therefore have to be included .",
    "moreover , the electrostatic interactions now involve _ partial _",
    "charges for each atom and the lennard - jones type is more commonly used than the born - huggins - mayer one for the remaining pairwise additive interactions .",
    "@xcite the repulsion and damping terms are then cast together in the following way :    @xmath28 \\label{eq : lj}\\ ] ]      as soon as a functional form has been chosen for the interaction potential , all the atomic and atom pair parameters have to be carefully determined . in all cases ,",
    "the overall charges on the cl@xmath29 , al@xmath30 , and emi@xmath0 are fixed as -1 , + 3 , and + 1 respectively .",
    "our approach consists in parameterizing the remaining terms on the basis of first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "@xcite this is achieved by a `` force - matching '' method , which is generalized by using the first - principles calculated induced dipoles in addition to the forces in the fitting procedure . amongst molten chlorides ,",
    "this method has already been applied successfully to the case of licl , nacl and kcl .",
    "@xcite here we extend this set of parameters in order to include the al@xmath30 and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cations .",
    ".interaction potential parameters ( partial charges , lennard - jones parameters ) used for the emi@xmath0 cation .",
    "@xcite note that the @xmath31 and @xmath32 parameters were used for the cation - cation van der waals interactions only .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     at the temperature of 573  k , which is above the melting point of the inorganic chloroaluminates , it is also possible to compare the diffusion coefficients of the various ions in all the systems .",
    "they are reported in table [ tbl : dynamiccoeff ] .",
    "for all the species , we observe an increase of the diffusion coefficient with the @xmath33 cation size .",
    "note that the number density also changes when switching from one system to another , which is likely to be the main cause for this evolution .",
    "still it is possible to come to the conclusions that in all systems the chloroaluminate anion diffuses more slowly than the corresponding @xmath33 cation .",
    "we can also conclude that the organic cation - based ionic liquid , emicl - alcl@xmath4 , fits into the same pattern of behaviour as the inorganic cations - based compounds in regard to the variation of transport properties with cation size .",
    "we have shown in this study that the polarizable ion model developed for simple molten salts  @xcite can successfully be transfered to chloroaluminate ionic liquids .",
    "the interaction potential was parameterized purely from first - principles through a force and dipole - matching procedure , and a common set of parameters could be obtained for the mixtures of alcl@xmath4 with several inorganic salts ( licl , nacl and kcl ) as well as with the organic 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride .",
    "an advantage of our model is that it allows us to quantify the chloroaluminate speciation due to the choice of treating al@xmath30 and cl@xmath29 as independent ionic species .",
    "a particular emphasis was given to the study of the equimolar mixture emicl - alcl@xmath4 , for which the structure yielded by the classical simulations performed within the framework of the polarizable ion model is compared to the results obtained from entirely electronic structure - based simulations : an excellent agreement between the two flavors of molecular dynamics is obtained , which enables us to conclude that the structure of emicl - alcl@xmath4 can almost be viewed as the one of a classical @xmath34 molten salt , where @xmath33  =  emi@xmath0 and @xmath35  =  alcl@xmath1 .",
    "the structure is characterized by a competition between close packing and charge ordering effects occuring between the two species .",
    "small deviations from the @xmath34 system are observed due to the existence of weak spatial correlations arising from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the ring protons and the chloride anions .",
    "when decreasing the cation ionic radius ( emi@xmath0  @xmath36  k@xmath0  @xmath36  na@xmath0  @xmath36  li@xmath0 ) small proportions of al@xmath2cl@xmath3 due to the reaction @xmath37 start to be observed ( al@xmath4cl@xmath38 is also observed in equimolar licl - alcl@xmath4 ) .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would be to study the same series of systems under non - stoechiometric conditions .",
    "the influence of the @xmath33 cation chemical nature in the lewis acidity of the melt can also be quantified using a recently developed method .",
    "@xcite in future work we will try to perform such calculations in order to relate it to the chloroaluminate speciation determined in the present study .",
    "the only many - body effect included in the interaction potential for emicl - alcl@xmath4 is the anion polarization , which enabled us to perform long enough runs to get the dynamic properties of the system , which are out of reach of first - principles simulations .",
    "the calculated transport properties were compared to the experimental data , showing again a good agreement for both the individual ( diffusion coefficients ) and collective ( electrical conductivities and viscosities ) dynamics of the system .",
