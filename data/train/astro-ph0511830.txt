    "the goal of this paper is to perform such tests numerically .",
    "let us estimate the magnitude of the warping effect .",
    "@xcite calculated the rate at which a massless accretion disc is warped by a massive ring inclined with respect to the ( initially flat ) disc at an angle @xmath6 . for radii @xmath7 much smaller or much larger than the ring radius , @xmath8 , the precession angular frequency @xmath9 can be approximated as @xmath10^{5/2}}\\;. \\label{omegapa}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the ring mass , assumed to be much smaller than the blackhole mass , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the kepler circular frequency for the disc at radius @xmath7 .",
    "the period of circular motion @xmath14 ( @xmath15pc at the distance of ) away from , where most of the bright young stars are found , is around 2 thousand years .",
    "therefore , the stars at this location make about a thousand revolutions in a few million years .",
    "let @xmath16 be the angle on which an annulus of the disc will precess during this time : @xmath17 .",
    "very approximately , the disc warping will be noticeable when @xmath18 .",
    "thus mass ratios @xmath19 in excess of @xmath20 or so may lead to warping of the stellar discs in .",
    "equation [ omegapa ] depends on the angle @xmath6 , and would also depend on the eccentricity of a stellar orbit if it were not assumed to be zero in the derivation .",
    "stars are expected to be born on nearly circular keplerian orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. with eccentricity @xmath21 , for star formation in a self - gravitating disc . on the other hand , @xcite have recently demonstrated that , due to a repetitive interaction with the imbh , stars peeled off the imbh - star cluster gain a substantial eccentricity to their orbits . even for the case of the circular imbh inspiral",
    ", stars acquire a mean eccentricity of @xmath22 .",
    "we may thus expect different mass limits for the two models of the origin of the young stars near .",
    "reader not interested in the technical details of the simulations and data comparison may simply look up the relevant limits and proceed to the discussion of the results in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to follow stellar orbits , we use the n - body package ` nemo ' @xcite with the orbit integrator ` gyrfalcon ' @xcite .",
    "the code calculates gravitational interaction of all the particles and updates their velocities and positions .",
    "we model the blackhole as a plummer sphere with a core radius of @xmath23 .",
    "this radius is much smaller than peri - centres of stellar orbits we consider .",
    "the stars are represented as particles with softening radius of @xmath24 or less for some tests .",
    "depending on the total mass of the stars , we use between few hundred to few thousand particles for each of the two stellar systems .    to set up the problem ,",
    "we shall rely on the gross results of @xcite , and the more recent analysis of the data by @xcite . for convenience only , we shall refer to the clock - wise rotating system in the gc as a disc , and the counter clock - wise system as a ring . to model the disc ,",
    "we start with stars in a flat disc with the radial extent from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . the observed counter clock - wise system contains fewer stars and it is harder to assign the radial extent for this system @xcite .",
    "we used two plausible guesses for the ring , therefore : one is a ring between @xmath27 and @xmath26 , and the other is a ring between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the initial inclination between the two systems is set at @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "other parameters of initial conditions specific to a model will be discussed below .",
    "the simulations were ran until time @xmath31 million years . to ensure numerical precision , the individual timesteps of the particles",
    "were kept small enough , e.g. in the range of @xmath32 to @xmath33 years .",
    "the angular momentum and total energy of the system were conserved to a relative error of @xmath20 or better .",
    "we did not include the isotropic cluster of late type stars around  in these simulations because in the radial range of interest its mass is small compared to that of , and it would not present any torques for the discs because of the cluster s spherical symmetry .    at the end of a simulation , we fit the two stellar systems by a plane in velocity space , @xmath34 .",
    "a plane is characterised by vector @xmath35 orthogonal to the plane and normalised to unity , @xmath36 .",
    "the best fitting planes are found via the reduced @xmath37 method for both of the two stellar systems .",
    "the reduced @xmath37 for a fit is defined as in @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of stars in the given stellar system , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the projections of @xmath35 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the errors in stellar velocities in the three directions . for simplicity",
    "we assume that these errors are isotropic , i.e. each component is equal to @xmath45 km / sec , where @xmath46 km / sec , the typical value for the absolute value of velocity error vector in @xcite .",
    "finally , to emulate the effects that the observational errors have on the @xmath37 fits through statistical scatter of the data around the mean , we added random gaussian velocity kicks to each star s velocity vectors according to the errors @xmath42 , etc , at the end of the simulations .",
    "as explained in  [ sec : method ] , we start with the two stellar systems oriented as the observed best fitting planes @xcite . the discs are populated by star particles with surface density @xmath47 for @xmath48 . the initial velocity dispersion of stars with respect to the local circular kepler velocity is isotropic and small , @xmath49 , consistent with the small initial gaseous disc thickness .",
    "a convenient way to illustrate the results is via the ` aitoff map projection ' of the stellar orbits .",
    "each stellar orbital plane can be characterised by the inclination angle @xmath50 with respect to the observer and the position angle @xmath51 which reflects the position of the lines of the nodes of the orbit on the plane of the sky ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the normal vectors to the plane , introduced above , are related to these angles as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the aitoff s projection then shows the latitude , defined as @xmath55 , and longitude @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig:3la ] shows the state of the two stellar systems 3 million years into one of the simulations , e.g. the final state .",
    "the total stellar masses in the disc and the ring systems ( cw and cc systems , respectively ) used in this simulation are noted in the left upper corner of the figure .",
    "the stars in the clock - wise system ( marked as cw on the figure ) are shown with green asterisks , whereas the counter - clockwise system is shown with red crosses , marked as cc .",
    "the lower left corner shows the resulting values of the minimum reduced @xmath37 values as a ( ring , disc ) pair .",
    "these are comfortably smaller than the observed values @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the clock - wise and the counter clock - wise stellar systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "apparently such a weak disc warping would not contradict observations .",
    "figure ( [ fig:6la ] ) , shows the same numerical experiment but with the disc and ring masses both around @xmath59 .",
    "as is clear from the figure , both systems suffer considerably from the gravitational torques imposed on each other , and the resulting plane - parallel fits to these are poorer than before .",
    "the reduced @xmath37 values are larger than the observed values for both the clock - wise and the counter clock - wise systems .",
    "figure [ fig:7la1 ] presents the aitoff map for the most massive case that we have explored , with the disc and ring masses both around @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting @xmath37 values are quite large and are clearly inconsistent with the data .",
    "note that the degree of mixing occurring in this simulation is extreme , and some of the particles that originally belonged to the clockwise disc are now classified as members of the counter - clockwise system .",
    "a stellar system with such poor values of @xmath37 may not even remotely be considered as consisting of two or one stellar discs , obviously .    in this latest example",
    "we have seen that stars from one system may evolve on orbits more consistent with the other system , and it would then be improper to continue to assign them to the disc of their birth place .",
    "certainly observationally such practice is impossible as it is not a priory known in which system the stars originated .",
    "instead , one divides the stars on the clock - wise and the counter clock - wise ones @xcite . to make a maximally fair comparison of the simulations with the data , at the end of the simulation",
    ", we assign particles to either the clock - wise or the counter clock - wise systems based on the sign of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the coordinates of the star .",
    "the resulting change is illustrated in figure [ fig:7la ] .",
    "the figure demonstrates that when the stellar systems are warped to the degree that their orbits diffuse into one another s phase space , even a more careful division of orbits still fails to produce systems as well defined as those observed to exist near .",
    "table [ tab : cl ] lists results of several runs with the larger stellar ring ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) .",
    "the first two column show the total stellar mass of the clock - wise ( the disc ) and the counter clock - wise ( the ring ) systems in solar masses .",
    "the next column shows an identifier of the run ( cl stands for `` circular large '' ) .",
    "next two columns list the best fitting @xmath37 values .",
    "the last column contains a `` + '' if the @xmath37 values are smaller than the observed ones , and a `` - '' in the opposite case .",
    "clearly this is not to be taken literally as in some cases the obtained @xmath37 are just slightly larger than the observed ones .",
    ".simulations results for circular initial orbits with the larger `` ring '' , with @xmath63 .",
    "`` fit quality '' below , @xmath64 or @xmath65 sign , indicates whether the reduced @xmath37 values are smaller or larger than the observed values .",
    "clearly this is just a rough measure of the model s feasibility . [",

    ". the resulting @xmath37 values are significantly larger than those for the initially circular orbits at same masses .",
    "we estimate that the disc masses must be less than @xmath66 we interpret these tighter upper limits as a result of a wider spectrum of orbits in the eccentric discs .",
    "the greater diversity in the orbits leads to a greater difference in the rates at which the orbital planes precess .      using the same ideas described above",
    ", we can ask a slightly different question .",
    "we can start with orbits spread around in the velocity space sufficiently wide to yield @xmath37 values consistent with the observed discs , follow these orbits for a shorter time , say a million year , and then measure the @xmath37 again .",
    "if @xmath37 significantly increases during this `` short '' time , such a disc should be rejected .",
    "the argument here is that during a time considerably shorter than the age of the discs , the observed system should not evolve ( get warped and mixed ) too much .",
    "we have ran a grid of models corresponding to disc and ring radii from the `` larger '' ring tests .",
    "the approximate upper limits on the masses of the system obtained in this way are @xmath67",
    "in this paper we modelled n - body evolution of two stellar discs guessing their initial geometrical arrangement based on their present day observed configuration , and then following stellar orbits for 3 million years . given the uncertainty in the initial guess , these tests can not be precise , but since the discs are about twice older than 3 million years @xcite , we feel our upper mass limits are conservative . in summary",
    ", we found that the total mass of each of the stellar systems orbiting  can not be greater than @xmath68 , with the lower values for eccentric initial stellar orbits , and the higher limits for the circular orbits .",
    "it is somewhat disappointing to us that these limits are consistent with both of the models for star formation near .",
    "the minimum gaseous mass of the disc at which it becomes gravitationally unstable and forms stars is around @xmath69 for  case @xcite .",
    "note that this was derived from the basic @xcite model , without including self - gravity into the hydrostatic balance equation for the disc .",
    "we expect the minimum @xmath70 to be another factor of @xmath71 lower , therefore .",
    "the mass of the stars formed through the disc collapse should be close to the original gas mass , as argued by @xcite , because the viscous time scale for gas accretion is much longer than the time scale on which the stars can devour the disc .",
    "thus the minimum stellar mass in that model is of order @xmath72 , in line with the upper limits obtained here .",
    "now , for the cluster infall model , the initial mass of the cluster should be as large as @xmath73 to allow it to spiral in rapidly enough , as well as to form an intermediate mass black hole that is heavy enough to prevent cluster dissolution away from the central parsec @xcite .",
    "however the final stellar masses that make it into the central parsec are always a very small fraction of the original cluster mass , and they appear to be consistent with the limits obtained here .",
    "we may also approach these mass limits from another angle . estimating the total mass of the _ observed _ young massive stars , and assuming a standard @xcite imf",
    ", one would predict the total stellar mass to be around @xmath74  ( few to 10 )  @xmath75 , depending on the low mass cutoff in the power - law .",
    "this would be a factor of several larger than the mass limits for the circular initial orbits .",
    "thus , _ if _ the stars were formed inside a massive self - gravitating disc , their imf should be at least somewhat deficient in the low mass stars .",
    "in fact , in a separate paper , @xcite show that a similar but even stronger argument can be made on purely observational grounds .",
