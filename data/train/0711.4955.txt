    "recent experiments @xcite strongly indicate the possibility to realize non - vanishing supercurrent across sufficiently thick half - metal ( h ) layers embedded in - between two @xmath0-wave bcs superconductors ( s ) .",
    "this physical situation appears rather non - trivial .",
    "indeed , in conventional sns junctions ( n stands for spin - isotropic normal metal ) the supercurrent is carried by ( spin - singlet ) cooper pairs penetrating into the n - metal layer from both superconductors due to the proximity effect .",
    "however , half - metals are fully spin polarized materials acting as insulators for electrons with one of the two spin directions . hence , penetration of spin - singlet electron pairs into half metals should be prohibited and no supercurrent would be possible .",
    "recently it was realized @xcite that this situation changes qualitatively if one allows for spin - flip scattering at hs interfaces .",
    "such scattering enables conversion of spin - singlet pairing in s - electrodes into spin - triplet pairing in a half - metal . in this way",
    "superconducting correlations can survive even in a half - metal ferromagnet , thus  unblocking  the supercurrent across shs junctions .",
    "subsequent numerical and analytical studies @xcite confirmed this physical picture also extending it to structures with disorder . in particular , it was argued @xcite that depending on the degree of disorder in the h - metal the origin of triplet pairing there can change from the @xmath1-wave type to the odd - frequency one @xcite .",
    "it was also realized that the presence of triplet pairing in strong ferromagnets and in half - metals can cause the so - called @xmath2-junction behavior of the system @xcite .    despite all these important developments the issue is yet",
    "far from settled .",
    "the goal of this paper is to work out a complete theory of dc josephson effect in clean shs heterostructures at arbitrary transmissions of hs interfaces .",
    "electron scattering at these interfaces will be described by the most general scattering matrices which fully account for spin - flip processes .",
    "depending on the system parameters we will find a rich variety of the results both for the temperature dependence of the supercurrent and for the current - phase relation in shs junctions demonstrating crucial importance of spin - flip scattering at hs interfaces .",
    "in addition we will also address andreev level quantization and show that this phenomenon in shs junctions acquires qualitatively new features which are not present in conventional sns structures .",

    "[ secquas ] we will employ the quasiclassical formalism which enables us to exactly evaluate the josephson current in shs structures with many conducting channels at any transmissions of sh interfaces . in sec .

    "@xmath268 with few conducting channels resonant effects play an important role causing substantial enhancement of the josephson current , see eqs.([res1 ] ) and ( [ res2 ] ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the behavior of both the josephson current and andreev bound states in shs structures crucially depends on the spin - flip parameters @xmath218 .",
    "similarly to refs .",
    "we observe that for incomplete spin - flip scattering the temperature dependence of the critical josephson current is non - monotonous with a maximum at non - zero @xmath122 , see fig .",
    "however , this feature disappears completely for @xmath269 and the josephson current monotonously increases with decreasing @xmath122 in this limit .",
    "another striking feature of our results is that shs junctions are characterized by the the sinusoidal current - phase relation at any temperature and interface transmissions provided the spin - flip parameters @xmath218 are not very close to unity . substantial deviations of the current - phase relation occur only provided ( i ) interface transmissions remain high , ( ii ) temperature remains low and ( iii ) the spin - flip parameters @xmath218 are very close to one , see fig .",
    "it also follows from our analysis that for symmetric shs junctions ( meaning that electron scattering at both interfaces is described by identical @xmath62-matrices ) the @xmath2-junction state is usually realized .",
    "however , in a general case the josephson current in shs junctions does not necessarily show the @xmath2-junction behavior , the current - phase relation is characterized by an arbitrary phase shift , see eq .",
