    "the topological properties have been investigated extensively in condensed matter systems such as topological insulators(tis)@xcite , topological superconductors(tscs)@xcite , etc , which are described by topological order @xcite instead of the traditional landau symmetry breaking theory . in ultracold atomic system , the effective spin - orbit coupling(soc )",
    "has been realized recently by utilizing the spatial varying laser fields@xcite . with the technique of feshbach resonance@xcite ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupled ultracold atomic systems provide a clean platform to investigate the topological properties of the condensed matter system .",
    "the soc significantly changes the fermi surface and largely enhances the low energy density of state@xcite .",
    "therefor , many interesting phases and intriguing phenomena become possible .",
    "the triplet pairing and the transition temperature are largely enhanced@xcite while the pair coherence lengths are suppressed by the soc@xcite . in three dimensions , the ground state of the fermi system",
    "is enriched by the soc@xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the superfluid phase of the spin - orbit coupled fermi gas can be topologically nontrivial@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is topologically nontrivial phase separation(tps ) which is the coexistence of superfluid phases with different topological order in the trapped soc fermi systems with population imbalance@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the uniform polarized two - dimensional(2d ) fermi gas with soc near a wide feshbach resonance at zero temperature .",
    "the phase separation is possible for a polarized fermi gas without the soc due to the competition between the polarization and the pairing interaction . to map out a exact phase diagram",

    "the topological phase transition(tpt ) takes place when the excitation gap is closing .",
    "therefor , the topologically nontrivial superfluid phase(tsf ) shows up in the phase diagram against the topologically trivial superfluid phase(nsf ) .",
    "for the phase separation phase , the topological phase transition much more tend to take place in the smaller pairing gap component state , thus the phase separation becomes topologically nontrivial .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] , introducing the hamiltonian of 2d uniform polarized fermi gas , we obtain the zero temperature thermodynamic potential by mean field theory , and then give the gap equation and the number equations for superfluid phase . in sec.[sec3 ] , we investigate the ground state by minimizing the thermodynamic potential of the phase separation phase and map out the phase diagram in detail .",
