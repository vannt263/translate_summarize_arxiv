    "environment of galaxies play a key role in their evolution at all epochs .",
    "recent work utilising data from the wide - field surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , have evidently shown that the galaxy number density and velocity fields play equally important roles in defining the immediate and the global environment of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "several authors have also speculated the role played by the large - scale supercluster environment in modulating galaxy properties , thereby extending the impact of environment to lower density regions such as galaxy groups @xcite , outskirts of clusters @xcite , and even the inter - cluster filaments feeding them @xcite .",
    "since galaxies span a continuous range in all observables such as broadband colours and star formation rate ( sfr ) , most of these studies suggest that galaxies are likely being  pre - processed \" before they are accreted into clusters .    galaxies presently transiting from an active , star - forming phase to passive evolution are called post - starbursta and post - starburst correspond to different spectral features depending upon the time since the last major starburst in a galaxy , they have been used interchangeably in the literature . in the context of this letter , a post - starburst galaxy as defined in  [ data ] is called a galaxy unless stated otherwise . ] ( or k+a ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "spectra of such post - starburst galaxies are often characterised by negligible emission , but strong absorption in balmer lines such as h@xmath1 and h@xmath3 .",
    "while the former indicates absence of ongoing star formation , the latter feature is an indicator of the presence of late a and early b - type stars , implying that star formation in the galaxy was quenched 500700myr ago .",
    "although post - starburst galaxies are found at all redshifts and in all environments , their frequency varies with environment , galaxy mass and redshift @xcite .",
    "if star formation in a galaxy is quenched because of mechanisms related to the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , the incidence of post - starburst galaxies should correlate with the properties of the icm .",
    "the fraction of post - starburst galaxies has been reported to be as high as a quarter of the total population of cluster galaxies @xcite at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the trend continues to @xmath11 , in the sense that in the nearby universe most of the stars are forming in dwarf galaxies , and , star formation in a large fraction of such cluster dwarfs is found to be quenched in dense environments @xcite .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that not only are different studies of post - starburst galaxies limited by different data attributes , but also employ different selection criteria for selecting post - starburst galaxies .",
    "hence , a comparison of relative fraction of post - starburst galaxies amongst different environments in the same study is more insightful than a comparison between absolute fractions .    at @xmath11 ,",
    "post - starburst galaxies seem to prefer less - dense environments , similar to blue star - forming galaxies @xcite , suggesting that environmental mechanisms related to dense clusters are not the only phenomena responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies .",
    "some post - starburst galaxies , however , may be a result of pre - processing of galaxies before they are accreted into clusters @xcite . as i will show below , while the immediate neighbourhood has an immediate impact on the properties of galaxies , the global environment can play an indirect role in the incidence of galaxies .    in the next section",
    "i describe the datasets used in this work , followed by the analysis and results in  [ s : frac ] and  [ s : env ] respectively .",
    "the major findings are summarised in  [ summary ] .",
    "this analysis makes use of a @xmath12cdm concordance cosmological model with @xmath13 km s@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for calculating distances and magnitudes .",
    "i selected abell clusters @xcite at @xmath17 having x - ray temperature measurement from bax ( http://bax.ast.obs-mip.fr/ ) .",
    "the spectroscopic data , complete to the absolute magnitude limit for each cluster corresponding to the sdss spectroscopic catalogue s apparent magnitude limit of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) was obtained from the sdss ( dr7 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion ( @xmath8 ) of these clusters was estimated using the @xmath20 velocity dispersion clipping technique .",
    "the final sample comprises 28 clusters , each having at least @xmath21 galaxies in the cluster core ( @xmath22 ) to evaluate @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 was then used to estimate the radius of the cluster using the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath25 @xcite .",
    ".cluster sample [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in order to evaluate the cluster parameters mentioned above , i started with all galaxies within @xmath26 km s@xmath14 of the cluster s mean line - of - sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "velocity , and within two degree radius .",
    "the final dataset comprises 5,735 galaxies within @xmath9 of the cluster centre , and having l.o.s .",
    "velocity such that the absolute velocity , @xmath27 , where @xmath7 is the difference between the l.o.s . velocity of the galaxy , and the cluster s",
    "mean l.o.s .",
    "the factor of five is chosen to include all cluster galaxies , as well as those falling into clusters .",
    "the position , @xmath8 and tx for all clusters are listed in table  1 .    in this letter a galaxy is defined as post - starburst ( or k@xmath28a ) , if its equivalent width ( ew ) in h@xmath29  in emission , and ew(h@xmath3)@xmath4  in absorption @xcite .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath30 galaxies within @xmath9 and @xmath31 in @xmath32 x - ray bright clusters ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "distribution of these galaxies in some typical clusters from the sample studied here are shown in figure  [ sky ] .",
    "nearby clusters offer a unique opportunity to study galaxies in a ` continuous ' range of environments . hence , whether galaxies are being transformed due to the environmental effects of the icm , or prior to encountering it , they can be caught in the act . in order to test the hypothesis that the incidence of galaxies is related to the cluster environment , i chose the most extreme environments in the nearby universe by using the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas in the cluster as a proxy .",
    "this allowed me to sample cluster galaxies down to at least @xmath33 @xcite using the sdss ( dr7 ) spectroscopic galaxy catalogue .",
    "these data were used to evaluate the fraction of galaxies using galaxies ( @xmath34 ) within @xmath9 and @xmath31 .",
    "the magnitude limit is chosen so as to evaluate the fraction with the same lower luminosity bound for clusters at all redshifts .",
    "figure  [ frac ] shows the fraction of galaxies as a function of the x - ray temperature of the icm .",
    "figure  [ frac ] shows a mild trend for an increase in the fraction with tx , with product moment correlation coefficient , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the two hottest systems in the sample ( abell85 and coma ) , are also known to have substantial substructure in galaxy distribution @xcite , and , x - ray data @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite showed that the post - starburst galaxies may be related to the presence of substructure in galaxy clusters .",
    "but with only a couple of data points at tx@xmath37kev , no substantial conclusions can be drawn to defend ( or reject ) any correlation between the fraction of galaxies and tx .",
    "figure  [ d3 ] shows the distribution of the mean distance to the three closest neighbours of a galaxy ( @xmath38 ; chosen to be within a redshift slice , @xmath39 km s@xmath14 around the galaxy ) , for the samples mentioned above .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test in favour of the hypothesis that both samples are drawn from the same parent population yields a probability of @xmath40 with median @xmath41 and @xmath42kpc , and maxima for the distributions being @xmath43 and @xmath44kpc , for all and cluster galaxies , respectively . in order to test if the discrepancy in the relative local densities of the two galaxy samples is dependent on @xmath45 chosen for evaluating @xmath38 , i re - calculated median @xmath38 including neighbours only within @xmath46 km s@xmath14 to be @xmath47 and @xmath48kpc for all and galaxies respectively .",
    "this suggests that the galaxies are found in locally over - dense regions within clusters .",
    "ideally , such an analysis should be performed in small radial bins in order to disentangle the impact of local over - density from that of the large - scale environment on galaxies , but the rarity of galaxies in low - redshift clusters only permits a stacked analysis .",
    "figure  [ vel ] shows the distribution of absolute velocity of all cluster galaxies within @xmath9 and @xmath49 , along with the galaxies in the same radial and absolute velocity range .",
    "the exclusion of galaxies with @xmath50 allows me to focus on the population of mostly non - virialized galaxies .",
    "the ks statistic probability in favour of the hypothesis that these two distributions are drawn from the same parent population is @xmath51 , suggesting that a non - negligible fraction of galaxies may have accreted into the clusters recently .",
    "@xcite found galaxies to be more frequent in low velocity dispersion galaxy groups ( 200400 km s@xmath14 ) and massive clusters ( @xmath52 ; also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , relative to the field and rich groups . in the coma supercluster ( @xmath53 )",
    ", @xcite found that galaxies mainly occurred on cluster outskirts and galaxy groups .",
    "i applied the ",
    "@xmath54-test \" devised by @xcite to test for localized variations in the velocity distribution of galaxies in each cluster .",
    "this test compares the velocity distribution of a group of @xmath55 nearest neighbours of each galaxy to the cluster s mean .",
    "the significance of @xmath56 is estimated by monte carlo simulations in which velocities of cluster galaxies are shuffled randomly .",
    "the test shows that 24/28 clusters in this sample are at least 95% likely to have substructures with 4 - 10 member galaxies .",
    "furthermore , 91.4% of all galaxies are found to be a part of one of these substructures ( p(@xmath57)=0.03% ) .",
    "together , these results suggest that the galaxies _ locally _ reside in marginally denser environment such as poor galaxy groups , and their presence may be correlated with accretion of such groups into clusters .",
    "quenching of star formation in galaxies may be a result of the  pre - processing \" happening in these small groups assembling into larger clusters .",
    "@xcite suggested that for a poor group falling into a rich cluster with comparable halo core density , the galaxy density for group galaxies can increase by an order of magnitude and their collision rate by a factor of about 100 ( density squared ) , thereby increasing the probability of a burst of star formation in the process .",
    "such bursting galaxies will eventually be observed as the post - starburst population such as that studied here .",
    "simulation of a galaxy group merging with a cluster four times more massive than itself , shows that starburst can be triggered in gas - rich galaxies due to the external pressure of the icm @xcite .",
    "these starburst galaxies will eventually be transformed into a population of post - starburst galaxies .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "argued that after the structure has finally relaxed ( @xmath58gyr ) , such galaxies will not show any preferred spatial distribution . for the sample studied here",
    ", i find that although the absolute velocity distribution of the galaxies is statistically different from other cluster galaxies in the same absolute velocity regime , they do not show any preferred spatial distribution relative to the cluster centre ( the ks test probability in favour of the hypothesis is @xmath59 for galaxies within @xmath9 ) .",
    "if we assume several small groups merging into present day galaxy clusters , such a random distribution of group galaxies being pre - processed is expected .",
    "however , several authors @xcite have argued against any correlation between the incidence of post - starburst galaxies and their global environment , suggesting that the post - starburst phase is not a dominant channel for converting the blue , star - forming galaxies to passively evolving red cluster galaxies .",
    "this letter presents a new angle to this dichotomy , by evidently showing that the incidence of galaxies in nearby rich clusters is correlated with _",
    "locally _ over - dense regions within clusters .",
    "since most of the galaxies in these clusters belong to group scale substructures , it is likely that the galaxies are being pre - processed in such galaxy groups during their accretion into the cluster .",
    "evidence for such pre - processing has also been reported by @xcite in galaxy groups falling into a cluster at @xmath60 . using optical and ultraviolet data for galaxies in optically - selected groups ( @xmath61 )",
    ", @xcite showed that not only sfr , but also sfr/@xmath62 is quenched in group galaxies .",
    "moreover , these authors found the effect to be strongest for low - mass ( @xmath63 ) galaxies .",
    "figure  [ mass ] shows the distribution of all cluster galaxies , and , galaxies in the @xmath64 space .",
    "the stellar masses are estimated using the relation given by @xcite .",
    "this figure shows that galaxies around clusters are mostly less than @xmath65 in stellar mass , but span almost the entire colour range populated by all cluster galaxies taken together .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous studies which showed that at @xmath11 post - starburst galaxies are more frequent among low - mass galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see rasmussen et al .",
    "this may happen because ( i ) most of the star formation at the present epoch is happening in low - mass galaxies , which are quenched during accretion into clusters , or , ( ii ) only low - mass galaxies go through a post - starburst phase when quenched .",
    "advanced simulations including better semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , environmental processes and feedback recipes are required to throw more light on this subject . incidentally , some work has already begun in this direction @xcite .",
    "i have used the x - ray and optical spectroscopic data for nearby ( @xmath66 ) galaxy clusters to show a mild trend of an increase in the incidence of galaxies with tx . however ,",
    "a cluster sample uniformly spanning the whole range in tx is required to confirm this . such a correlation , if found , will confirm that the icm plays a critical role in quenching star formation in infalling galaxies .    for the x - ray bright clusters studied here , although galaxies show only a marginal ( statistically insignificant ) preference for higher clustercentric distances , their absolute velocity distribution is different from other cluster galaxies ( @xmath67 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "these galaxies are also found in locally over - dense regions relative to other cluster galaxies .",
    "86% of clusters in this sample show statistically significant substructure on group scales in velocity distribution , with 91.4% of all galaxies belonging to one of these groups with 4 - 10 members .",
    "together , these results suggest that galaxies are likely to be members of poor galaxy groups , whose star formation may have been quenched as a result of pre - processing during accretion into clusters .",
    "these results favour the argument that the sfr in galaxies falling into clusters may be enhanced on the cluster outskirts by a burst of star formation triggered due to galaxy - galaxy interactions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , it remains debatable whether the global environment plays any significant role in accelerating these interactions when the group encounters the cluster potential @xcite , or , the group environment self - sufficiently aids the evolution of galaxies @xcite , irrespective of the large - scale environment .",
