    "both regimes were accessed by studying aluminum grains of different sizes .",
    "a pairing gap was observed in the excitation spectra of the larger grains with an even number of electrons .",
    "however , in the smallest grains , such a pairing gap could not be resolved .",
    "these experiments generated much interest in superconductivity in finite - size systems and , in particular , in the fluctuation - dominated regime .",
    "it was proposed that pairing correlations in the fluctuation - dominated regime can be observed through the number - parity dependence of thermodynamic observables such as the heat capacity and spin susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "for example , the spin susceptibility of an odd grain exhibits a re - entrant behavior ( i.e. , a local minimum ) as the temperature decreases  @xcite .",
    "the linear size of the ultra - small grains studied in spectroscopy experiments is typically smaller than the mean free path of the electrons inside the grain , and the single - particle dynamics are dominated by scattering from the boundaries of the grain . in grains with irregular boundaries ,",
    "the single - particle dynamics are chaotic .",
    "a characteristic energy scale in such grains is the thouless energy @xmath4 , which is determined by the time required for an electron at the fermi energy to cross the grain .",

    "when the dimensionless thouless conductance @xmath5 is large , a metallic grain with chaotic single - particle dynamics is described by the so - called universal hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the single - particle part of this hamiltonian follows rmt , while the interaction is composed of three universal terms : a classical charging energy term that depends on the capacitance of the grain , a bcs - like pairing term ( which is suppressed in the presence of an external orbital magnetic field ) , and a spin exchange term ( in the absence of spin - orbit scattering ) .    the single - particle part of the universal hamiltonian and the pairing term favor minimization of the total spin , while the ferromagnetic exchange term tends to polarize the grain . in the bulk limit @xmath2 ,",

    "in the absence of spin - orbit scattering and orbital magnetic field , the universal hamiltonian for a fixed number of electrons has the form  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the pair creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath10 is the total spin of the electrons in the grain . the single - particle energies @xmath11 follow the statistics of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of rmt  @xcite .",
    "when the particle number @xmath12 is not fixed ( e.g. , in the presence of a varying gate voltage ) , an additional charging energy term @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the capacitance of the grain ) must be included in ( [ universal_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the randomness of the single - particle eigenstates @xmath15 induce fluctuations in the electron - electron interaction matrix elements @xmath16 , and the latter form an induced two - body ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the universal terms in ( [ universal_hamiltonian ] ) follow from the average part of this induced random interaction .",
    "this can be derived from the requirement that the average interaction @xmath17 be invariant under a change of the single - particle basis ( the goe , which describes the one - body part of the hamiltonian , is invariant under an orthogonal transformation of the single - particle basis ) . there are three orthogonal invariants : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we then have @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath7 are constants .",
    "when expressed in its second - quantized form , this average interaction leads to the interaction terms of the universal hamiltonian ( [ universal_hamiltonian ] ) ( where we have omitted the charging energy term related to @xmath23 ) .",
    "the fluctuating part of the interaction is suppressed by @xmath24  @xcite and can be ignored in the limit @xmath25 .    in practical calculations ,",

    "the single - particle part of the hamiltonian and the pairing term favor minimization of the total spin and lead to superconductivity in the bulk , while the spin exchange term tends to polarize the grain and leads to ferromagnetism when the exchange coupling constant exceeds the stoner instability threshold .",
    "we have identified signatures of the competition between pairing and exchange correlations in the following observables : ( i ) the ground - state spin of the grain ; ( ii ) the mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance of a grain that is weakly coupled to leads , and ( iii ) thermodynamic observables such as the heat capacity and spin susceptibility .",

    "( i)_ground - state spin_. the ground - state phase diagram of the grain exhibits a coexistence regime in which the electrons in the grain are partly paired and partly polarized .",
    "the ground - state spin at fixed @xmath56 is a monotonic stepwise function of @xmath6 .",
    "the values of @xmath6 at which such steps occur increase with @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath56 is sufficiently large , the change @xmath207 of the ground - state spin in the first step can be larger than 1 ( this is known as a spin jump ) .",
    "the mesoscopic fluctuations of the ground - state spin acquire a finite variance in the presence of exchange correlations , and they are suppressed by the competing pairing correlations .",
    "when both the exchange and pairing interactions are sufficiently strong ( @xmath114 and @xmath208 ) , the ground - state spin distribution has a local minimum , which is a signature of spin jumps .",
    "( ii)_linear conductance_. in the absence of pairing and exchange correlations , the distribution of the coulomb - blockade conductance peak spacings is expected to be bimodal ( because the single - particle energy levels are spin degenerate ) . in semiconductor quantum dots ( in which the pairing interaction is repulsive and its effects can be ignored ) , this bimodality is suppressed by the exchange interaction . however , the competing attractive pairing correlations in metallic grains can restore the bimodality of the conductance peak spacing distribution .",
    "the number of many - particle energy levels that participate in the low - temperature conductance increases in the presence of exchange correlations since levels with higher spin values shift down in energy .",
    "this leads to the suppression of the peak height fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , pairing correlations reduce the number of low - lying levels ( because of the pairing gap ) and thus tend to enhance the peak height fluctuations .",
    "there is a regime in the parameter space @xmath209 in which the peak spacing distribution exhibits the signature of pairing correlations ( i.e. , it is bimodal ) , while the peak height fluctuations show the signature of exchange correlations ( i.e. , they are suppressed ) .",
    "this is a mesoscopic coexistence regime of pairing and exchange correlations .",
    "thermodynamics_. pairing correlations lead to a number - parity effect in the heat capacity and in the spin susceptibility of the grain .",
    "this effect is shifted to lower temperatures in the presence of exchange correlations . in the fluctuation - dominated regime @xmath3 ,",
    "the odd - even effect is suppressed by exchange correlations . however , for @xmath210 , certain signatures of pairing correlations , such as a peak in the heat capacity for an even grain and a local minimum in the spin susceptibility of an odd grain , are enhanced by exchange correlations .",
    "this is explained by the stronger dependence of thermodynamic observables on the exchange coupling strength at higher temperatures and the much weaker dependence at low temperatures .",
    "mesoscopic fluctuations of thermodynamic observables can wash out the odd - even effects for sufficiently small @xmath56 or large @xmath6 .",
    "the fluctuations of the spin susceptibility are more sensitive to exchange correlations in the fluctuations - dominated regime and become particularly large as @xmath6 approaches the stoner instability .",

    "<S> is the fluctuation - dominated regime where the bulk pairing gap is comparable to or smaller than the single - particle mean level spacing and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of superconductivity breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity and ferromagnetism can coexist in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> we identify signatures of the competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in a number of quantities : ground - state spin , conductance fluctuations when the grain is weakly coupled to external leads and the thermodynamic properties of the grain , such as heat capacity and spin susceptibility . </S>"
