    "confining a binary mixture , one can profoundly alter its miscibility behavior@xcite .",
    "the phase behavior of @xmath2 mixtures in pores , slits and films has attracted abiding interest from both theorists and experimentalists@xcite alike .",
    "we study the interplay between ( pre)wetting and phase behavior by self - consistent field ( scf ) theory@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "particularly , we focus on situations where surfaces attract different components of the mixture",
    ".    the qualitative features of the miscibility in confined geometry are rather universal and shared by polymer mixtures as well as small molecules .",
    "symmetric binary polymer blends are , however , particularly well suited to study the interplay between wetting and miscibility : ( i ) the wetting transition temperature typically is much lower than the critical temperature , where demixing occurs in the bulk@xcite , ( ii ) fluctuations can be controlled by the degree of interdigitation@xcite : the more extended the molecule is , the larger is the number of neighbors it interacts with , and the smaller the effect of fluctuations . therefore scf calculations provide an accurate description for many properties except for the ultimate vicinity of critical points . the spatial extension of the molecules also sets the length scale of enrichment layers and facilitates experimental investigations .",
    "indeed , wetting transitions have been studied in recent experiments@xcite .",
    "( iii ) the vapor pressure of polymer films is vanishingly small , hence effects of evaporation can be neglected .",
    "( iv ) polymers tend not to crystallize easily .",
    "therefore , wetting phenomena might not be preempted by crystal phases .",
    "likewise there is no roughening transition of the interface as it occurs in ising - like models .    using a coarse - grained polymer@xcite model for a @xmath2 binary melt",
    "we locate the first order wetting transition , the phase diagram in a symmetric slit pore ( symmetric film)@xcite , the phase diagram in a thin film where the substrate favor the @xmath3-component of the mixture with the same strength as the top surface attracts the @xmath4-component ( antisymmetric film)@xcite .",
    "then we discuss the phase behavior in a quadratic pore where two neighboring surfaces favor the @xmath3-component and the other two neighboring surfaces favor the @xmath4-component ( antisymmetric double wedge)@xcite .",
    "we conclude with an outlook .",
    "we consider a binary polymer blend .",
    "both species  @xmath3 and @xmath4  contain the same number @xmath5 of monomers and have the same spatial extension @xmath6 .",
    "they are confined into a thin film ; the bottom substrate ( w ) might be a silicon wafer , while the other surface might be the interface to the vapor ( vacuum , v ) . depending on the ratio between the interface tension @xmath7 between the segregated bulk phases and the surface tension @xmath8 , @xmath9 of the components and the vapor",
    ", the upper surface might be rough .",
    "the qualitative behavior is illustrated in fig.[fig : ill ] .",
    "if the @xmath2 interface tension is comparable to the liquid / vapor tension , it `` drags '' the film surface towards the substrate so as to reduce the length of the @xmath2 interface . if the liquid / vapor tension exceeds the @xmath2 interface tension by about two orders of magnitude , however , the surface is almost flat and the situation is equivalent to a binary mixture between two hard walls a distance @xmath0 apart@xcite . in the following",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to this limit @xmath10 or @xmath9 .    in the monte carlo simulations we use a computationally efficient , coarse - grained lattice model .",
    "the bond fluctuation model@xcite retains the universal features of polymers  connectivity , excluded volume of segments and a thermal interaction which leads to phase separation  but ignores details of chemical structure .",
    "effective monomers prevent the corners of a unit cell of a 3d cubic lattice from double occupancy .",
    "we use chain length @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "monomers along a chain are connected via bond vectors of length @xmath13 or @xmath14 in units of the lattice spacing @xmath15 .",
    "different monomers repel each other by a square well potential of depth @xmath16 which comprises the nearest 54 neighbors , like monomers attract each other .",
    "the strength of the repulsion is proportional to the flory ",
    "huggins parameter @xmath17@xcite .",
    "surfaces are structureless and impenetrable .",
    "they act on monomers in the two nearest layers ( @xmath18 ) with strength @xmath19 .    in the scf calculations we model the polymers as gaussian chains@xcite .",
    "the repulsion between different species is quantified by the flory - huggins parameter @xmath20 .",
    "short - ranged interactions of strength @xmath21 and @xmath22 attract ( repel ) the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) component in the vicinity of the surfaces .",
    "the total density profile of the film is imposed .",
    "it smoothly decays to zero at the surfaces in a boundary region of width @xmath23 .",
    "the blend is assumed to be incompressible .",
    "this standard gaussian chain model is solved within mean field approximation .",
    "to accurately locate the wetting transition and calculate the contact angle of macroscopic @xmath3-drops we use young s equation@xcite @xmath24 .",
    "computationally , this techniques@xcite has distinct advantages for locating first order wetting transitions : ( i ) the interface free energy @xmath7 and the difference @xmath25 can be measured accurately in separate simulations thereby avoiding the need for huge simulation cells to simulate a thick @xmath3-layer at the surface in equilibrium with a @xmath4-rich bulk .",
    "( ii ) unlike observing the dependence of the thickness of the @xmath3-layer on temperature or monomer - surface attraction , one directly measures free energies .",
    "therefore , we do accurately locate the transition , while the instability of the @xmath3-rich layer is located between the transition and the mean - field wetting spinodal .",
    "( iii ) by virtue of the @xmath26 symmetry , the difference @xmath27 can also be rewritten as the difference @xmath28 of surface tensions of a wall that attract the @xmath3-component and a wall that attracts the @xmath4-component .",
    "this free energy difference can be measured by thermodynamic integration or expanded ensemble methods@xcite .",
    "the results for our model are presented in fig.[fig : siwet ] . from the crossing of @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "we locate the wetting transition .",
    "the fact that curves intersect under a finite angle indicates that the wetting transitions are of first order . as we reduce the monomer - surface attraction the wetting transition shifts to higher temperatures @xmath31 and become weaker .",
    "for all transitions studied , however , the wetting transition is of first order .",
    "this is also corroborated by scf calculations@xcite , where we find first order wetting transitions for @xmath32 .",
    "if the wetting transition is of first order , then there will be only a small @xmath3-rich layer in the non - wet state . by virtue of the structural symmetry of the molecules",
    ", they loose the same amount of entropy as they pack against the surface .",
    "the surface free energy difference @xmath33 is mainly enthalpic .",
    "if we assume that the wetting transition is strongly first order , we can neglect the microscopic enrichment layer at the surface @xmath34 , where @xmath18 denotes the range of the monomer - surface interaction and @xmath35 the monomer number density . using the expression for the interface tension @xmath36 ( @xmath37 : statistical segment length ) in the strong segregation limit@xcite , we obtain : @xmath38    this is in marked contrast to the value of the flory ",
    "huggins parameter at the unmixing transition in the bulk , @xmath39 . as both the interface tension @xmath7 and the difference in surface tension @xmath33 are chain length independent , so is the wetting transition temperature .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath40 of phase separation , however , increases linearly with chain length @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , critical phenomena associated with the bulk unmixing and wetting phenomena are well separated .",
    "if the mixture is confined into a film the surface interactions modify the phase behavior . as wetting",
    "is associated with the growth of an infinitely large enrichment layer , it is rounded - off in a thin film@xcite .",
    "if the wetting transition is of first order , there will be a pre - wetting transition@xcite : a coexistence between a thin and a thick ( but microscopic ) enrichment layer at a chemical potential which differs from the value at coexistence in the bulk .",
    "as pre - wetting transitions involve only enrichment layers of finite thickness , they might give rise to transitions in thin films .",
    "first we regard a film with symmetric surfaces@xcite , i.e.  both surfaces attract the @xmath3 component . the phase diagram as obtained from the simulations",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdmc ] . compared to the phase behavior in the bulk , the critical point",
    "is shifted to lower temperatures and larger composition of the species attracted by the surfaces .",
    "moreover , the binodal in the vicinity of the critical points exhibit 2d ising critical behavior in contrast to the 3d ising behavior of the bulk unmixing transition .    note the pronounced distortion of the @xmath4-rich binodal in the vicinity of the wetting transition . in the @xmath4-rich phase",
    "there are @xmath3-rich layers at the surfaces and the @xmath4 component prevails in the middle of the film . in the vicinity of the wetting transition",
    "the thickness of the @xmath3-enrichment layers grows as we increase the temperature .",
    "if we increased the film thickness this distortion would evolve into an additional two phase region@xcite , corresponding to a @xmath4-rich phase with thin and thick @xmath3-layers at the surface .",
    "this two phase region would correspond to the pre - wetting coexistence and it would join the @xmath4-rich binodal in a triple point .",
    "the phase diagram of an antisymmetric film is also presented in fig.[fig : pdmc ] . in this case",
    "one surface attracts the @xmath3-component with exactly the same strength than the other surface the @xmath4-component .",
    "the phase diagram contains two critical points and a triple line@xcite . around the critical temperature of the bulk",
    ", enrichment layers gradually form at the surfaces and stabilize an @xmath2 interface that runs parallel to the surfaces . at the interface localization / delocalization transition@xcite",
    "this @xmath2 interface becomes bound to one of the surfaces . in the case of a first order interface localization / delocalization transition",
    "this corresponds to a triple point of the phase diagram : an @xmath3-rich phase , a @xmath4-rich phase and a phase with symmetric composition coexist .",
    "the behavior can be analyzed qualitatively by looking at the interface potential @xmath41 which describes the interaction between an @xmath2 interface and a single surface .",
    "if the film is thick enough , the interface potential can be constructed as a superposition of the interface potentials emerging from each surface .",
    "the qualitative behavior in the vicinity of a first order wetting transition is depicted in fig.[fig : ginz](*a * ) .",
    "using a double - tangent construction we can construct the phase behavior in a thin film . at low temperatures there coexist an @xmath3-rich phase and a @xmath4-rich phase , in which the @xmath2 interface is localized at the surface . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "one encounters the triple point .",
    "this triple point is the thin film analogon of the first order wetting transition .",
    "as the film thickness increases the triple temperature converges towards the wetting transition temperature of the semi - infinite system . above the triple temperature",
    "there are two phase coexistence regions , which correspond to thin and thick enrichment layers at the surfaces .",
    "this is the analogon of the pre - wetting transition in a thin film .",
    "if we reduce the film thickness , the interactions emerging from each surface interfere .",
    "the phenomenological considerations@xcite explain that this leads to a second order interface localization / delocalization transition at small film thicknesses .",
    "both regimes are separated by a tricritical transition .",
    "the scaled distribution functions prove convenient to locate the tricritical thickness accurately . to this end",
    "we have adjusted the temperature such that the central peak of the probability distribution of the order parameter @xmath42 is a factor 1.2 higher than the outer peaks .",
    "this corresponds to the behavior of the universal distribution of the 2d tricritical universality class@xcite .",
    "the results for various film thicknesses @xmath0 ( in units of the lattice spacing ) are presented in fig.[fig : fsstri ] .",
    "for @xmath43 the valleys between the three peaks are too shallow ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : fsstri ] ) , while they are too deep for @xmath44 . in the latter case",
    "the transition is of first order and our estimate tends towards the triple temperature . at @xmath45",
    "the distribution of our simulations is similar to the universal 2dt distribution , and this has been confirmed for larger lateral system sizes@xcite .      realizing strictly ( anti)symmetric surface interactions is often difficult in experiments .",
    "varying the surface interaction @xmath46 of the top surface from attracting the @xmath3-component to attracting the @xmath4-component ( while the bottom surface always attracts the @xmath3-component with fixed strength @xmath47 ) in the scf calculations , we study the crossover from capillary condensation for symmetric surfaces to interface localization / delocalization .",
    "the dependence of the phase diagram on the surface interactions within the scf calculations is presented in fig.[fig : cross ] . for symmetric surfaces ( capillary condensation ) the critical point",
    "is shifted towards lower temperatures@xcite similar to the simulation result .",
    "of course , the binodals are parabolic in mean field theory independent from dimensionality .",
    "the coexisting phases have almost uniform composition across the film and differ in their composition . as we reduce the preference of the top surface for species @xmath4 , the critical point and the critical composition tend towards their bulk values ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , i.e.  the critical temperature increases and the critical composition becomes more symmetric@xcite .",
    "the coexistence curve in the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane approaches the symmetry axis . upon making the top surface attracting the other component @xmath4",
    ", we gradually change the character of the phase transition towards an interface localization / delocalization transition@xcite .",
    "the critical temperature passes through a maximum and the critical composition through a minimum , respectively .",
    "for @xmath52 ( surface attracting the @xmath4-component ) there are enrichment layers of the @xmath3-component at the bottom and the @xmath4-component at the top , and the two coexisting phases differ in the location of the @xmath2 interface which runs parallel to the surfaces . as the preferential interaction of the top surface increases , the critical temperature decreases and the critical composition becomes richer in @xmath3 . when the coexistence curve intersects the pre - wetting line of the bottom surface at @xmath53 , a triple point forms at which an @xmath3-rich phase and two @xmath4-rich phases with a thin and a thick @xmath3-enrichment layer coexist",
    "when the bottom surface attracts @xmath3 with exactly the same strength as the top surface @xmath4 ( antisymmetric surfaces ) , the phase diagram becomes symmetric .    for symmetric surface fields",
    "the critical point occurs close to the bulk critical point ( and converges towards it in the limit of infinite film thickness ) while the critical points in antisymmetric films are associated with the wetting transition and converge towards the pre - wetting critical temperature of the semi - infinite system ( if the wetting transition is of first order ) for @xmath54 . in both cases , however , critical points belong to the 2d ising universality class .",
    "in the following we consider wetting ( or rather filling ) in a wedge geometry .",
    "macroscopic considerations show that the wedge will be filled with liquid when the contact angle @xmath55 on a planar substrate equals the opening angle @xmath56 .",
    "intriguingly , parry and co - workers@xcite predict that the filling of a wedge is related to the strong fluctuation regime of critical wetting and that critical filling may even occur if the concomitant wetting transition of the planar surface is of first order .",
    "specifically , they predicted the distance @xmath57 of the @xmath2 interface from the bottom of a wedge to diverge as @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "correlations along the wedge and in the other two directions are characterized by diverging correlation lengths @xmath60 and @xmath61 with exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .    in the following",
    "we study a wedge with opening angle @xmath64 of the wedge ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig : wedge ] ) .",
    "similar to the study of wetting an antisymmetric geometry is advantageous .",
    "therefore we stack two wedges which attract different components on top of each other .",
    "this antisymmetric double wedge is a pore with quadratic cross - section of size @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the length of the wedge ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig : wedge ] ) .",
    "( i ) if we used identical surface fields on all four free surfaces the analog of capillary condensation would occur in a wedge , i.e. , phase coexistence would be shifted away from the bulk coexistence curve and the wetting layers would be only metastable ( with respect to `` wedge condensation '' ) .",
    "( ii ) as the wetting layer grew on all four surfaces in the case of symmetric boundaries , we would need larger system sizes to reduce interactions between the wetting layers across the wedge .",
    "the phase behavior in such an antisymmetric double wedge geometry has been studied recently in the framework of an ising model@xcite .",
    "when the wetting transition of the planar substrate was of first order , the wedge filling was also found to be of first order .",
    "when the wetting transition was of second order an unconventional scaling behavior was observed which is characterized by critical exponents @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . those critical exponents can be related ( see below ) to the exponents of critical wedge filling , and the simulations of the ising model confirm the predictions of parry and co - workers@xcite .    in the following we corroborate these findings in the framework of the ising model by our polymer simulations .",
    "moreover , we present evidence for the unconventional second order transition in an antisymmetric double wedge even though the wetting transition on a planar substrate is of first order .",
    "we present preliminary simulation data for two temperatures : @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) . at both temperatures the wetting transitions , that occur at appropriate attractive strength @xmath74 of planar surfaces , are of first order ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig : siwet ] ) . in the former case",
    "it is weak first order wetting transition , in the latter case it is a strong first order transition .      at the lower temperature @xmath72 ,",
    "the behavior is similar to a first order interface localization / delocalization transition .",
    "we consider here only the case @xmath75 where phase coexistence in the bulk occurs .",
    "this excludes the rather interesting interplay between pre - wetting and pre - filling behavior studied in ref.@xcite . at large surface interaction @xmath76",
    "there runs an @xmath2 interface along the diagonal which divides the two double wedges .",
    "this corresponds to the delocalized state . upon decreasing @xmath74 ( or decreasing the temperature )",
    "the @xmath2 interface becomes localizes in one of the wedges . in this case",
    "the composition of the double wedge is either @xmath3-rich or @xmath4-rich and we define as order parameter @xmath77 .",
    "the two situations are separated by a triple point @xmath78 at which the interface can be localized in either of the wedges or delocalized on the diagonal .",
    "the trimodal probability distribution in the vicinity of the tricritical point is presented in fig.[fig : pfirst ] . in analogy to the case of antisymmetric films we expect this triple point in a double wedge to correspond to a first order filling transition . in the inset",
    "we show the cumulant @xmath79 .",
    "if the transition was of second order , these cumulants would depend monotonically on @xmath74 and would exhibit a common intersection point .",
    "this is not at all what we observe , and we conclude that the interface localization / delocalization transition in the double wedge is of first order at the lower temperature @xmath72 .      even though the wetting transition on a planar surface at @xmath70 is of first order , the behavior at the interface localization / delocalization transition in an antisymmetric double wedge at high temperature differs from the transition at low temperature . in the inset of fig.[fig : wcrit ] ( * a * ) we present the dependence of the cumulant on the surface interaction strength for various system sizes .",
    "the cumulants depend monotonically on @xmath74 and exhibits a common intersection point around @xmath80 . in panel ( * b * ) we show the probability distribution of the composition @xmath81 at this intersection point : the distribution is bimodal and the two largest system sizes collapse onto a master curve without any size dependent prefactor .",
    "therefore we conclude that the interface localization / delocalization transition is of second order . , @xmath82 )",
    "is only @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we believe that our conclusion is not affected by finite size effects . ]",
    "intriguingly there are also marked differences between this second order transition in an antisymmetric double wedge and the second order transition in a thin film which belongs to the 2d ising universality class . in the latter case ,",
    "only the distribution of the _ scaled _ order parameter @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the critical exponents of the order parameter and the correlation length in the 2d ising universality class , exhibits data collapse for different system size .",
    "moreover , we present in fig.[fig : wcrit](*a * ) the dependence of the absolute value of the magnetization in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "curves for different system sizes exhibit a common intersection point which agrees well with the intersection point of the cumulants . the analogous curves at a ising - like transition do not exhibit a common intersection point but monotonously converge towards @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 upon increasing the system size .    to relate the critical behavior of the antisymmetric double wedge to the predictions of parry _ et al._@xcite",
    ", we regard the distance @xmath57 of the @xmath2 interface from the corner of one wedge .",
    "similar to an antisymmetric film ( c.f .",
    "sec .  4.1 ) , we assume that we can approximate the distribution in a double wedge by the superposition of the distributions of single wedges @xmath91 via @xmath92 if the two distributions @xmath91 and @xmath93 do not overlap , the @xmath2 interface will be located in either of the two wedges and the order parameter will not vanish .",
    "if the two distributions overlap , the interface fluctuates around the diagonal and the order parameter will be zero .",
    "right at the transition the two distributions begin to overlap : @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the mean height in a single wedge and @xmath96 its fluctuations .",
    "importantly , parry s prediction of @xmath97 in wedges ( and also corners@xcite ) means that the height and its fluctuations are of the same order .",
    "they diverge as we approach the critical filling transition .",
    "the height of the interface @xmath57 is related to the order parameter @xmath98 of the localization / delocalization transition .",
    "therefore we expect the distribution of the order parameter also to be bimodal .",
    "as @xmath99 at the transition and the order parameter is a function of @xmath100 the distribution of the order parameter will exhibit two peaks whose positions and widths will not depend on the system size .",
    "this is exactly what we observe in fig.[fig : wcrit](*b * ) .",
    "using this observation and the standard finite size scaling assumption at a second order phase transitions @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are scaling functions , @xmath104 denotes the relative distance to the filling transition , and @xmath105 denotes the generalized aspect ratio , we conclude @xmath106 . due to the anisotropy of the fluctuations of the interface along the wedge with correlation length @xmath107 and perpendicular to the wedge with correlation length @xmath96 the generalized aspect ratio appears as a scaling variable . in our simulations",
    "we have chosen the system geometry such that @xmath108 remains approximately constant to ensure that finite size finite - size rounding in the direction along the wedge and the rounding in the two other directions set in simultaneously .",
    "constant @xmath109 and the system would exhibit a behavior characteristic of a corner . in the limit @xmath110 fixed but",
    "@xmath66 the wedge becomes quasi - onedimensional and there is no transition.@xcite ] hence , the scaling of the probability distribution not only confirms @xmath68 but also @xmath111 .",
    "knowing the probability distribution of the order parameter we can calculate all its moments : @xmath112 where @xmath113 are scaling functions . as a special case , we calculate the susceptibility : @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "gratifyingly these values for the exponents comply with the anisotropic hyperscaling relation@xcite @xmath116 . using thermodynamic scaling @xmath117",
    "we infer the critical exponent @xmath118 for the specific heat .",
    "another consequence of the absence of any @xmath110-dependent prefactor in eq.([eqn : moments ] ) is the common intersection of moments of the order parameter at the transition .",
    "again this is an agreement with our observation in fig,[fig : pfirst](*a * ) . as this intersection involves only the lowest moment of the order parameter it yields an accurate estimate of the location of the critical interface localization / delocalization transition in an antisymmetric double wedge .",

    "<S> confining a binary mixture , one can profoundly alter its miscibility behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative features of miscibility in confined geometry are rather universal and shared by polymer mixtures as well as small molecules , but the unmixing transition in the bulk and the wetting transition are typically well separated in polymer blends . </S>",
    "<S> we study the interplay between wetting and miscibility of a symmetric polymer mixture via large scale monte carlo simulations in the framework of the bond fluctuation model and via numerical self  consistent field calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the film surfaces interact with the monomers via short ranged potentials and the wetting transition of the semi  infinite system is of first order . </S>",
    "<S> it can be accurately located in the simulations by measuring the surface and interface tensions and using young s equation .    </S>",
    "<S> if both surfaces in a film attract the same component , capillary condensation occurs and the critical point is close to the critical point of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> if surfaces attract different components , an interface localization / delocalization occurs which gives rise to phase diagrams with two critical points in the vicinity of the pre - wetting critical point of the semi  infinite system . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover between these two types of phase diagrams as a function of the surface field asymmetry is studied .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the dependence of the phase diagram on the film thickness @xmath0 for antisymmetric surface fields . upon decreasing the film thickness </S>",
    "<S> the two critical points approach the symmetry axis of the phase diagram , and below a certain thickness @xmath1 , there remains only a single critical point at symmetric composition . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a second order interface localisation / delocalisation transition even though the wetting transition is of first order . at a specific film thickness , @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> tricritical behavior is found .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of antisymmetric films is compared with the phase behavior in an antisymmetric double wedge . </S>",
    "<S> while the former is the analogon of the wetting transition of a planar surface , the latter is the analogon of the filling behavior of a single wedge . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence for a second order interface localization / delocalization transition in an antisymmetric double wedge and relate its unconventional critical behavior to the predictions of parry _ et al .  _ </S>",
    "<S> ( phys.rev.lett * 83 * ( 1999 ) 5535 ) for wedge filling . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior differs from the ising universality class and is characterized by strong anisotropic fluctuations . </S>"
