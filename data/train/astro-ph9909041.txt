    "algol - type systems are short - period eclipsing binaries composed of an early - type primary and a ( near ) main - sequence late - type secondary .",
    "the short orbital period ensures that both stars are tidally - locked fast rotators .",
    "the secondaries in these systems show strong magnetic activity with copious x - ray emission .",
    "while tidally - induced activity is a common characteristic in rs  cvn - type systems , the early - type primary in algol - type systems , lacking a surface convective envelope , is not expected to be able to sustain a dynamo .",
    "therefore the coronal structures should be concentrated on the secondary only , making for a simpler geometry and avoiding the complication of cross - system loop structures which may exist in the case of rs  cvn - type binaries . because of its proximity ( 28.46  pc on the basis of the hipparcos parallax , @xcite )",
    "the eponymous system algol is one of the apparently strongest coronal x - ray sources in the sky .",
    "its brightness ( @xmath0 ) soon made the periodic fading obvious ( it was first reported , in the western world , by geminiano montanari in 1667 ) , and their interpretation in terms of mutual eclipses in a binary system was already proposed by john goodricke in 1782 .",
    "the system consists of a b8v primary and a k2iv secondary ( plus a more distant tertiary component , with a period of @xmath1 yr and a spectral type a or f ) .",
    "@xcite report values for the masses and radii of the two components @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4  cm , @xmath5 , while @xcite reports @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  cm , @xmath9 ; the orbital inclination is reported to be @xmath10  deg .",
    "we will adopt the @xcite parameters in the following .",
    "the orbital period is @xmath11  d. the ephemeris we have adopted in the present work is hjd 2445739.0030 + 2.8673285@xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the separation is 14.14@xmath13 , or @xmath14 times the radius of the k star .",
    "algol was identified as an x - ray source already in the 70s with observations from the sas  3 satellite ( @xcite ) and its soft x - ray emission was confirmed with sounding rocket flights ( @xcite ) .",
    "its intense activity level has made it a target of choice for most uv , euv and x - ray observatories .",
    "the high level of x - ray emission was initially interpreted in the framework of the mass - transfer paradigm , given the evidence from optical data of mass transfer taking place between the two components ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , spectroscopic observations soon showed a hot , thermal x - ray spectrum , requiring the presence of magnetically confined plasma , i.e.  of a corona , expected to be located on or around the k - type secondary .",
    "the soft x - ray emission of algol is characterized by the frequent occurrence of major flares .",
    "almost all sufficiently long observations to date have yielded a significant flaring event , with exosat ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ginga ( @xcite ) and rosat ( @xcite ) all observing long - lasting flares ( with effective decay times ranging between 5 and 20  ks ) , which have been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "the above flares have all been analyzed in a similar way , allowing for a reasonably homogeneous comparison of their characteristics to be made .",
    "in particular , the observed decay has in all cases been used to derive ( following the formulation of @xcite ) the length , and consequently , the average density of the flaring plasma , under the assumption that the flaring loop evolves throuh a series of `` quasi - static '' loop states . in all cases",
    "the analysis has made use of the observed constancy of the normalized ratio between the radiative and conductive cooling time @xmath15 ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : qs ] ) to ascertain that the flaring loop(s ) are cooling through a sequence of quasi - static states , and of the small value of the heating function present as a parameter in the quasi - static formalism to establish the lack of additional heating during the flare decay phase .",
    "the loop lengths thus derived range between @xmath16 and @xmath17  cm ( i.e.  between 0.4 and 2.4 @xmath18  see table  [ tab : comp ] ) .",
    "these large loops ( comparable or larger in size than the stellar radius , unlike the solar case , in which flaring structures are small compared to the solar radius ) are however shorter than the coronal pressure scale height because of their high temperatures and the low surface gravity of the k - type subgiant algol secondary .",
    "the corresponding plasma densities , derived within the same framework , range between @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "the general picture for the flaring regions observed on algol is therefore one of large and rather tenuous loops , a natural consequence of the very energetic and long - lasting flares if no heating is indeed present during the decay phase . in the solar case , in addition to the `` compact '' flares , in which the plasma appears to be confined to a single loop whose geometry does not significantly evolve during the event , a second class of flares is usually recognized , i.e.  the `` two - ribbon '' flares , in which a disruptive event appears to open up an entire arcade of loops , which subsequently closes back , leading to the formation of a growing system of loops whose footpoints are anchored in h@xmath22-bright `` ribbons '' .",
    "two - ribbon flares are generally characterized by a slower rise and decay , and a larger energy release .",
    "compact flares have often been considered to be due to `` impulsive '' heating events , while the longer decay times of two - ribbon events have been considered as a sign of sustained heating .",
    "however , also in the case of compact flares sustained heating has been shown to be frequently present ( @xcite ) , so that the distinction may indeed be less clear than often thought .",
    "long - lasting stellar flares have at times considered as analogs to solar two - ribbon flares ( due to their longer time scales , e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "however , the only available theoretical framework so far available to model this type of event ( @xcite ) relies on a large number of free parameters and assumptions ( such as the conversion efficiency of the magnetic field into x - rays and the assumption of instantaneous dissipation of the reconnection energy ) . as a consequence the physical parameters of the flaring regions derived with this approach are , for spatially unresolved events such as the stellar ones , rather strongly dependent on some specific assumptions , so in practice most stellar flares have been modeled as compact events .",
    "we will follow the same approach here , however keeping in mind the possibility that the event may not be necessarily described as a compact one .",
    "we have performed a long ( @xmath23  ks elapsed time , covering a full orbit of the system ) observation of algol with the bepposax x - ray observatory , aiming at studying both the spectral and the temporal characteristics of its x - ray emission . during the observation a very large and long - lasting flare was observed .",
    "we present in this paper a detailed analysis of the characteristics of this flare , deriving the temporal evolution of the spectral parameters of the plasma ( temperature @xmath24 , emission measure @xmath25 , coronal abundance @xmath26 , absorbing column density @xmath27 ) , and subsequently applying different methods to the analysis of the flare decay in order to derive the physical characteristics of the flaring region . for this purpose",
    "we have applied both the quasi - static decay method of @xcite and the method of @xcite , which allows for the possibility of ( exponentially decaying ) sustained heating during the flare decay , and simultaneously deriving both the time scale of heating and the size of the flaring loop . in line with the previous analyses of large flares on algol , the analysis of the flare s decay using the quasi - static approach results in a long and tenuous flaring loop ,",
    "although in this case the derived loop size and density are more extreme given the exceptionally long duration and peak temperature of the event .",
    "one unique characteristic of the flare studied here is that its emission underwent a total eclipse coincident with the secondary optical eclipse .",
    "this allows ( as discussed in detail in a companion paper , @xcite ) to put a firm upper limit to the size of the flaring region , and thus to compare , for the first time in a context other than the solar one , the length derived through the analysis of the flare decay with the geometrical size of the emitting region .",
    "this comparison shows that the loop sizes derived from the analysis of the flare decay through the quasi - static method are significantly larger than the geometrical size of the flaring region .",
    "therefore the actual flaring region must have had a much larger plasma density , and sustained heating must have been present during all the decay phase to explain the long observed decay time .",
    "the method of @xcite produces a large range of allowed loop lengths , which at the lower end overlap with the size derived for the flaring region from the eclipse analysis . also ,",
    "this type of analysis points to the presence of significant sustained heating during the decay phase .",
    "the metal abundance of the flaring plasma is seen to vary significantly during the course of the flare s evolution .",
    "abundance variations during the evolution of the flare were already hinted at in the analysis of the ginga ( @xcite ) and rosat ( @xcite ) flares , and evidence for this type of effect has been reported for flares on other stars .",
    "the combination of high statistics , good spectral resolution and wide spectral coverage of the present algol observation make it however possible for the first time to quantitatively derive the evolution of the plasma abundance . finally , large variations of absorbing column density are also observed during the early evolution of the flare , hinting at the possibility of a coronal mass ejection taking place in association with the onset of the flare .",
    "although flares of different types from several classes of coronal sources have been discussed in detail in the literature in the past , the large flaring event on algol discussed in the present paper is exceptional for several reasons :    * its long duration ( almost two days ) associated with its high luminosity allows for high signal - to - noise spectra to be collected with a time resolution small compared with the time scale of flare evolution , and thus to analyze in detail the temporal evolution of the plasma parameters with small statistical errors , and on different time scales . * the complete , uninterrupted time coverage , from several thousand seconds before the onset of the flare until the end of its decay allows for its complete temporal evolution to be studied . *",
    "the occurrence of a _ total _ eclipse of the flaring plasma by the primary star allows , for the first time , for a geometrical determination of the size of the flaring structure ( see @xcite ) , which can then be compared with the loop lengths derived through an analysis of the decay of the spectroscopic parameters .",
    "this allows for a critical test of the assumptions underlying these techniques , which are the only ones available when confronted with stellar flares with no spatial resolution . * the high x - ray flux and spectral temperature associated with this event , together with the unprecedented energy coverage offered by the instrumental complement of the bepposax observatory allow for the spectrum of the flaring plasma to be studied between 0.1 and 100  kev , thus removing the uncertainties on the temperature of the flaring plasma during the hottest phases of large flares ( where even the asca instruments can only provide lower limits to the temperature ) which have characterized previous analyses of large flares . at the same time",
    ", the spectral shape can be critically determined , in particular looking for the presence of non - thermal spectral components .",
    "the bepposax observatory ( @xcite ) features different instruments , four of which were used in the analysis of our algol observation , i.e.  the lecs ( @xcite , which covers the energy range 0.110  kev ) , the two mecs detectors ( @xcite , mecs-2 and mecs-3 , covering the range 1.610  kev ) and the pds detector ( @xcite , covering between 15 and @xmath28  kev  only data in the 15100  kev band were used in the present paper ) .",
    "the bepposax observation of algol covered a complete binary orbit ( i.e.  @xmath23ks elapsed time ) .",
    "it started on aug .  30 , 1997 at 03:04 ut ( shortly before the primary optical eclipse ) and lasted until sep .  1 , 1997 at 20:32 ut .",
    "approximately 20ks after the beginning of the observation , a very strong flare began , whose evolution dominates the rest of the observation .",
    "a detailed analysis of the total eclipse of the flare as seen in the mecs detectors is presented by @xcite , who derive the corresponding geometrical constraints on the size and shape of the flaring region .",
    "the present paper will concentrate on the spectral analysis of the x - ray emission and on the analysis of the characteristics of the flaring region from the flare decay , using the complete spectral range covered by the bepposax detectors .",
    "telemetry files , containing both information on individual detected x - ray photons and house - keeping data were obtained from the observation tapes for each instrument , and data for each instrument were individually processed with the saxdas software ( available from the bepposax scientific data center ",
    "hereafter sdc , reachable at http://www.sdc.asi.it ) , with the default settings , producing fits - format linearized photon event files for each instrument .",
    "for the three imaging instruments ( lecs , mecs-2 , mecs-3 ) standard extraction regions were used , i.e.  8.2 and 4.0  arcmin diameter circles centered on the source , for the lecs and mecs data , respectively .",
    "the background was extracted from regions of the same size and location as the source extraction region from the standard background files supplied by the sdc .",
    "spectra and light - curves both for the source and the background were extracted using the xselect software .",
    "pds spectra and light - curves were extracted using the saxdas - supplied packages , which directly produce background - subtracted spectra and light - curves .",
    "the background - subtracted light - curve in the 15100  kev band , extracted from the pds data , is shown in fig .  [ fig : lcpds ] , binned in 6000  s intervals , while the background - subtracted light - curve in the 1.610.0  kev band , extracted from the mecs-3 detector is shown , binned in 600  s intervals , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the light - curve for a softer band ( 0.10.5  kev ) derived from the lecs data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcle ] , binned in 900  s intervals .",
    "the lecs is operated during earth night only , resulting in a lower observing efficiency and in the larger data gaps seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcle ] with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .    inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] shows that the flare ( as seen in the 1.610  kev band ) has a rather slow rise ( with @xmath29  ks between the flare start and the peak .",
    "the decay is for the first @xmath30  ks relatively rapid , on time scales comparable with the rise , but then slows down becoming very nearly exponential .",
    "the eclipse due to secondary is well visible , between @xmath31 and @xmath32  ks from the beginning of the observation .",
    "the exponential decay is interrupted , at @xmath33  ks , by the onset of yet another flare .",
    "the hard ( 15100  kev ) x - ray light curve shows a slow rise , similar to the one seen in the 1.610  kev band , but a faster decay .",
    "the hard x - ray count rate returns to its pre - flare value at @xmath34  ks from the beginning of the observation , so that the eclipse of the flaring plasma is not visible in this band . also , there is no evidence for hard pre - flare emission , which could in principle have been due to non - thermal emission associated with fast particles .",
    "the soft - band ( 0.10.5  kev ) light curve differs significantly from the 1.610  kev band light curve , as the rise is slower , and the decay `` bounces back '' , after @xmath35  ks , for @xmath36  ks .",
    "these differences are discussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : abs ] .    [ cols= \"",
    "> , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : compsax ]    for comparison we also list , in table  [ tab : compsax ] , the parameter values derived , for the bepposax flare , with the different approaches discussed above .",
    "the large algol flare discussed here has several unique characteristics , already listed in the introduction , which make it a unique event given the level of detailed constraints which can be derived on the flaring process .",
    "the most important conclusions are :    * the variations of metallicity of the flaring plasma ( which had already been hinted at in the study of previous x - ray flares ) can be unambigously determined .",
    "the long duration of the flare and the good count statistics make it possible to determine the temporal evolution of the metal abundance , showing that it rises by a factor of three during the flare rise and decays again to the pre - flare value on time scales faster than any of the observed time scales ( for the light curve , emission measure of temperature decay ) .",
    "alternative explanations ( as opposed to real abundance variation effects ) for the observed changes in the spectrum , such as non - equilibrium effects , are difficult to reconcile with the plasma density for the flaring loop ( a fortiori for the higher densities implied by the eclipse ) , which imply that the plasma would relax to equilibrium ionization conditions in a few tens of seconds at most .",
    "fluorescence from the x - ray bombarded photosphere is in contrast with the lack of observed shift of the centroid of the fe  k line toward 6.4  kev and from the fact that the flare occurs in the permanently - occulted pole of the k - type star , so that the potentially fluorescing photosphere would in any case be largely self - eclipsed .",
    "* during the initial ( rising ) phase of the flare the best - fit absorbing column density is large ( @xmath37  @xmath38 ) , and decays on time scales of some tens of ks .",
    "we interpret this as possibly associated with moving , cool absorbing material in the line of sight , i.e.  a major coronal mass ejection associated with the flare s onset . *",
    "the length derived for the flaring loop from the analysis of the flare decay , with the quasi - static formalism of @xcite is consistently too large when compared with the upper limit on the size of the flaring region imposed by the observed total eclipse ( see @xcite ) .",
    "different assumptions result in a small range of derived loop half - lengths ( from @xmath39 to @xmath40  cm ) , they are all well above the eclipse - derived upper limit of @xmath41  cm . given the nature of the geometric constraints imposed by the eclipse observations , the conclusions is thus that the decay - derived loop lengths are too large , by a factor of at least a few times , and the derived densities are correspondingly lower .",
    "this may be relevant also for the interpretation of the very large loop sizes which have been determined with this method in the past for other large x - ray flares on other stars .",
    "* the range of loop lengths derived with the analysis method of @xcite imply the presence of significant sustained heating , in agreement with the conclusions drawn on the basis of the eclipse - derived size .",
    "the derived lengths are still marginally too large with respect to the eclipse - derived size ; this is likely due to the application of the method in the presence of a significant reheating episode , which ( when compared with hydrodynamical simulations with monotonically decreasing heating ) will introduce additional uncertainties in the results .",
    "nevertheless , even in such case , this method appears to yield more reliable information on the physical conditions of the flaring region than the quasi - static method .",
    "* as a consequence of the smaller loop length implied by the eclipse , sustained heating must be present throughout the flare , and it must actually be driving the decay .",
    "given the small intrinsic thermodynamic decay time of the loop implied by the small size and corresponding high density , the loop has a small `` thermal inertia '' , and thus the heating time profile must essentially be the same as the observed x - ray luminosity profile ( given in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] ) .",
