    "long s equation [ 1,2,3,4 ] models the flow of stratified incompressible fluid in two dimensions over terrain .",
    "when the base state of the flow ( that is the unperturbed flow field far upstream ) is without shear the numerical solutions ( in the form of steady lee waves ) of this equation over simple topography ( i.e. one hill ) were studied by many authors [ 5 - 13 ] .",
    "the most common approximation in these studies was to set brunt - visl frequency to a constant or a step function over the computational domain .",
    "moreover the values of two physical parameters which appear in this equation were set to zero .",
    "( these parameters control the stratification and dispersive effects of the atmosphere - see @xmath0 . ) in this ( singular ) limit the nonlinear terms and one of the leading second order derivatives in the equation drop out and the equation reduces to that of a linear harmonic oscillator over two dimensional domain .",
    "careful studies [ 8 ] showed that these approximations set strong limitations on the validity of the derived solutions [ 9 ] .",
    "long s equation also provides the theoretical framework for the analysis of experimental data [ 14,15,29 ] under the assumption of shearless base flow .",
    "( an assumption which , in general , is not supported by the data ) . an extensive list of references appears in [ 16,17,18 ] .",
    "an analytic approach to the study of the solutions of this nonlinear equation was initiated recently by the current author [ 19,20,21 ] .",
    "we showed that for a base flow without shear and under rather mild restrictions the nonlinear terms in the equation can be simplified .",
    "we also identified the `` slow variable '' that controls the nonlinear oscillations in this equation . using phase averaging approximation we derived for self similar solutions of this equation a formula for the attenuation of the stream function perturbation with height .",
    "this result is generically related to the presence of the nonlinear terms in long s equation .",
    "the impact that shear has on the generation and amplitude of gravity waves was investigated by us in [ 20 ] .",
    "a new representation of this equation in terms of the atmospheric density was derived in [ 21 ] .",
    "one of the weak aspects of long s equation is related to the fact that the terrain is represented by the shape of the domain and the boundary conditions . as a result",
    "the impact of different terrains on the solution of this equation can only be studied numerically .",
    "furthermore discretization errors which occur in the representation of the terrain render it impractical to consider complex terrain . in part",
    "these errors are due to the scale of the terrain relative to the computational domain . accordingly",
    "only simple topographies which were represented by one hill were considered in the literature . furthermore even for these simple topographies only approximate boundary conditions were applied at the terrain .",
    "( see discussion in @xmath1 ) .    with this motivation",
    "it is our objective in this paper to derive a terrain following formulation of long s equation in which the terrain is incorporated as part of the coefficients of the differential equation , and the computational domain is always a rectangle .",
    "this new representation makes it possible to derive new analytic insights about the solution of this equation in some limiting cases .",
    "it will make it easier also to study how the solution varies as a function of the terrain and other parameters that appear in the equation .",

    "<S> we derive a new terrain following formulation of this equation which incorporates the terrain as part of the differential equation rather than the geometry of the domain . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to new analytic insights about the solutions of this equation and enable us to compute steady state gravity wave patterns over complex topography .    </S>",
