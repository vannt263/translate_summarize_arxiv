    "according to the generally accepted recycling scenario suggested by @xcite , millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are descendants of neutron stars ( nss ) , which were spun up by accretion from roche - lobe filling companion stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "this scenario has been extensively studied in the literature with the main emphasis at the neutron star spin frequency , evolution of the companion star , and parameters of the binary system ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "ns temperature has not been typically considered as an important parameter for neutron star recycling , and is not even mentioned in most of the papers in the field . however , ns temperature is crucial for the instability of r - modes ( similar to rossby waves controlled by the coriolis force ) driven by chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs , @xcite ) mechanism due to emission of gravitational waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "namely , if a rapidly rotating ns is hot enough , it becomes unstable with respect to excitation of r - modes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; the corresponding region of ns temperatures and spin frequencies is often referred to as ` the instability window ' ) .",
    "this instability is known to modify the ns evolution in lmxbs dramatically ( see section [ sec_minmod ] and , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it can limit rotation frequencies of nss ( @xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", we ( @xcite ) argued that the r - mode instability can lead to additional channel of ns recycling : formation of a new class of nss  hot widows / hofnars ( from hot and fast non - accreting rotators )  in addition to msps .",
    "thus , accurate account for the r - mode instability should be important for the recycling scenario ; conversely , verification of the recycling scenario can put stringent constraints on the r - mode instability and , therefore , on the properties of superdense matter .",
    "in this paper we analyse constraints on the r - mode instability within the recycling scenario .",
    "we base our analysis on the following observations :    * x - ray observations of transiently accreting neutron stars in lmxbs ( section [ sec_xray ] ) ; * timing of msps ( section [ sec_timing ] ) ; * x - ray and uv observations of msps ( section [ sec_xray_msp ] ) .",
    "we do not take into consideration observational data on binary system parameters ( orbital period , eccentricity etc . ) , because they seem to be determined by the evolution of binary system ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and not affected directly by the r - mode instability .",
    "the set of observations ( a ) allows one to estimate the surface temperatures ( in the quiescent state , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and spin frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) for a number of accreting nss .",
    "it has been shown to be a crucial test of the r - mode instability theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , those references has demonstrated that the ` minimal ' model of r - mode instability window , suggested by @xcite ( ns has a nucleonic core , r - mode damping is associated with shear and bulk viscosities , see section [ sec_minmod ] ) , should be supplemented by additional damping mechanism at redshifted internal temperatures @xmath5  k , rather than by the local temperature @xmath6 , because it is @xmath7 , which is constant throughout the star . ] ( alternatively , saturation amplitude for r - modes should be extremely small , the so called ` tiny r - mode amplitude scenario ' , see section [ sec_tiny ] and , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of papers is devoted to identification of the required damping mechanism ( see the recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite argues that finite temperature effects in superfluid ns cores can lead to resonance mode coupling and suppression of the r - mode instability at certain stellar temperatures . as a result ,",
    "the instability window is splitted up by ` stability peaks ' in the vicinity of these temperatures . @xcite",
    "discuss evolution of nss in lmxbs within this model and suggest a ` resonance uplift scenario ' , which allows them to explain the observational set ( a ) .",
    "other ideas about the required additional damping include enhanced mutual friction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , crust - core coupling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and exotic core composition ( e.g. , @xcite ) . concerning the observational set ( a ) we point out that any successful theory should not only stabilize the observed nss in lmxbs , but also explain their temperatures .",
    "msp timing [ set of observations ( b ) ; see section [ sec_timing ] ] has also been used to constrain the r - mode instability . @xcite",
    "discuss formation of msps assuming bulk viscosity driven suppression of r - mode instability .",
    "they predict that spin down of the fastest msps can be affected by r - modes .",
    "furthermore , these nss should have internal temperatures @xmath8  k , being the sources of thermal x - rays .",
    "@xcite analyse formation of recycled nss within the resonance uplift scenario and concluded that it does not contradict the idea that msps are descendants of nss in lmxbs .",
    "they also predict that the most rapidly rotating msps should be rather hot ( with internal temperatures @xmath9  k ) due to r - mode heating .",
    "@xcite argue that the minimal instability model requires extremely small r - mode saturation amplitudes to match the observed pulsars spin - down .",
    "@xcite discuss msp formation and conclude that compact stars with the cores composed of ` ungapped interacting quark matter ' are consistent with observations of lmxbs and msps ( see a critique of this statement in section [ sec_bulk ] ) .",
    "they also confirm that additional damping is required to describe msps by the models with nucleonic core composition . in this paper ( section [ sec_timing ] ) we present an independent argument in favour of enhanced r - mode damping at low temperatures , based on the msp internal heating mechanisms : superfluid vortex creep ( @xcite ) , rotochemical heating ( @xcite ) , and rotation - induced deep crustal heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray and uv observations [ set ( c ) , section [ sec_xray_msp ] ] attract less attention in the r - mode literature , because the data for most of the observed msps do not require thermal emission from the whole surface ( but only from hot spots , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the surface temperature is measured only for psr j0437 - 4715 by @xcite . for other msps",
    "the surface temperature is thought of as generally unknown ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or not too high ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we argue that x - ray and uv observations allow one to put an upper limit on the redshifted surface temperature of msps , @xmath10 , and argue that @xmath11  k can be chosen as a fiducial value , applicable to all msps ( otherwise thermal emission from the whole surface should be observed , see section [ sec_xray_msp ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to an upper limit on the internal temperatures of msps : @xmath12  k ( here and below , to estimate internal temperatures of nss , we consider a canonical ns with the mass @xmath13 and @xmath14  km , and use the accreted envelope model from @xcite ) .",
    "this constraint is crucial for r - mode instability models , because any successful model should not only stabilize nss at these temperatures ( in the opposite case r - mode instability heats msps up to higher temperatures ) , but also explain how they came into this temperature region .    in sections [ sec_tiny]-[sec_gen ]",
    "we apply observations ( a - c ) to constrain the r - mode instability parameters .",
    "namely , in section [ sec_tiny ] we improve constraints on the tiny r - mode amplitude scenario . in section [ sec_bulk ]",
    "we analyse models based on an enhanced bulk viscosity , in particular , the ungapped interacting quark matter model , suggested by @xcite , and conclude that it can hardly explain temperatures of the hottest nss in lmxbs .",
    "in section [ sec_reson ] we analyse the resonance uplift scenario .",
    "we demonstrate that low - temperature stability peaks at @xmath15  k are required by observations , and those resonances are likely to be broad .",
    "these results are extended to a quite general class of r - mode instability models in section [ sec_gen ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec_consl ] .    during the final stage of the preparation of this manuscript we became aware of the work by @xcite , who also use x - ray observations to constrain msp temperatures and derive upper bounds on the r - mode amplitudes for these sources .",
    "the results of our section [ sec_tiny ] qualitatively agree with those of @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results of this work were presented by one of us ( aic ) at the two conferences : ( i ) ` the modern physics of compact stars and relativistic gravity 2015 ' ( september 30  october 3 , yerevan , armenia , 2015 ) ; and ( ii ) ` the international workshop on quark phase transition in compact objects and multimessenger astronomy : neutrino signals , supernovae and gamma - ray bursts ' ( october 7  october 14 , nizhnij arkhyz & terskol , russia , 2015 ) .",
    "in this section we describe the minimal r - mode instability model and confront it with each of the three sets of observations ( a)(c ) from section i.    ) on the msp temperature .",
    "temperatures and frequencies of nss observed in lmxbs are shown by filled circles , error bars show uncertainties due to ns envelope composition ( section [ sec_xray ] ) . the pulsar b1937 + 21",
    "is shown by star ; its low - temperature error bar is set by the rotation - induced deep crustal heating ( see section [ sec_timing ] ) , the upper error bar is set by the fiducial limit ( [ teffmax ] ) on the msp temperature .",

    "@xmath23 is the ns spin rate .",
    "the minimal r - mode instability model suggested by @xcite includes shear and bulk viscosities as damping agents and assumes nucleonic equation of state .",
    "the shear viscosity damping time can be estimated as . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the bulk viscosity damping time was calculated by @xcite : @xmath26 the total damping time is @xmath27 , however , the effect of bulk viscosity is negligible for temperatures of msps and nss in lmxbs .",
    "the r - mode is stable if @xmath28 ( grey region in fig .",
    "[ fig_minmod ] ) and unstable in the opposite case @xmath29 ( white region in fig .",
    "[ fig_minmod ] ) . in the unstable region",
    "the r - mode amplitude is growing until it reaches saturation , where the nonlinear effects become important .",
    "gravitational waves emitted by r - modes reduce stellar angular momentum @xmath30 at a rate @xmath31 the dissipation of r - mode leads to additional heating power ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 for saturated and @xmath34 for unsaturated r - mode , respectively , and @xmath35 .",
    "general equations that describe evolution of a ns affected by r - mode instability were formulated by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the typical evolution track is shown by thick black line in fig.[fig_minmod ] . during the initial phase ns is spinned up by accretion and its temperature @xmath36 is determined by the balance between the cooling [ the corresponding emissivity is @xmath37 and deep crustal heating @xmath38 ( @xcite ) : @xmath39 here the coefficient @xmath40 determines efficiency of deep crustal heating . as shown by @xcite , when a ns enters the instability region due to continuous accretion , the r - mode amplitude starts to grow and its subsequent evolution is very fast ( provided that the saturation amplitude is not too small ) . eventually , the star rapidly heats up and slows down , leaving the instability region . in the stable region",
    "it gradually cools down to the temperature @xmath41 , and a new spin up cycle starts again . in principle , during its life a ns in lmxb can complete several such cycles but it is important that the probability to catch it in the instability region is negligible ( see also appendix b in @xcite for a set of analytical estimates ) . after roche - lobe decoupling ( see filled circle in the evolution curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_minmod ] ) a star cools down and an msp is formed ( msp evolution track is shown by dashed line ) .",
    "msp spin frequency is limited by the r - mode instability curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations of some of the transiently accreting nss allow one to measure their surface temperature in the quiescent state ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the internal temperature can be inferred from the surface temperature , assuming thermally relaxed envelope , with the help of analytical fitting formulas presented in @xcite . furthermore , the spin frequency can be measured for accretion- and nuclear - powered msps ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "both spin frequency and internal temperature are available for a rather large number of objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , observations of transiently accreting nss in the active state allow one to estimate average accretion rate and the corresponding heating power associated with nuclear reactions in the accreted crust ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we employ the data for 20 nss from the table i of @xcite , where a number of misprints found in the previous works has been corrected ( see dots with error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig_minmod ] , temperature for hete j1900.1 - 2455 was updated according to @xcite , @xmath42k ) .",
    "at least 8 nss among them are predicted to be r - mode unstable within the minimal r - mode instability model .",
    "however , a probability to observe even one ns unstable is almost vanishing within the minimal r - mode instability model ( see section [ sec_minmod ] ) .",
    "thus , observations of large number of nss , which appears to be unstable , can be treated as evidence of additional ( apart from the shear viscosity ) damping at the temperatures of these objects , @xmath43  k , or r - mode saturation at very small saturation amplitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that this problem can hardly be resolved by enhancing the shear viscosity ( e.g. , to stabilize 4u 1608522 one should enhance it by a factor of 1000 , which seems to be very unlikely ) or by fitting the mass - radius relation ( for example , 4u 1608522 should have a radius @xmath44  km to be stable within the minimal r - mode instability model ) .",
    "timing of msps allows one to measure the spin frequency ( see ticks on the left side of @xmath16 axis in fig.[fig_minmod ] ; only pulsars with @xmath45  hz are shown in the figure ) and the spin - down rate .",
    "these data were taken from atnf pulsar catalogue ( @xcite ) .    within the minimal r - mode instability model msp spin frequencies",
    "should be limited by the r - mode instability .",
    "thus , origin of the high frequency msps ( especially those with @xmath46  hz ) is unclear in this model , because they should have very low equilibrium temperatures to be stable during the spin up phase in the lmxb stage .",
    "thus explanation of msps requires additional damping or use of a tiny saturation amplitude model ( see section [ sec_tiny ] and , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a direct constraint on the r - mode instability comes from internal heating mechanisms  superfluid vortex creep ( @xcite ) , rotochemical heating ( @xcite ) , and rotation - induced deep crustal heating ( @xcite )  which can be efficient enough to push psr b1937 + 21 ( j1939 + 2134 in j2000 system ) into the r - mode instability window ( see fig.[fig_minmod ] ) . to estimate the internal heating power @xmath47 for msps we rely on the rotation - induced deep crustal heating mechanism , because it is not affected by the uncertainties in the parameters of baryon superfluidity .",
    "physics of rotation - induced deep crustal heating is rather simple .",
    "msp spin down ( e.g. , by magneto - dipole losses ) results in a gradual compression of stellar matter . within the recycling scenario paradigm ,",
    "the crust of msps should consist of accreted matter , thus the compression should lead to the same nuclear transformations in the crust as in the case of accreting nss ( i.e. , to deep crustal heating ) .",
    "for example , for psr b1937 + 21 which has high frequency ( @xmath48  hz ) and relatively fast spin - down rate ( @xmath49  s@xmath50 ) , the rotation - induced deep crustal heating gives @xmath51  ergs@xmath52 , depending on the equation of state and pulsar mass .",
    "to balance this heating power at the lowest possible temperature ( in order to get it stable ) , a powerful cooling process should be active in the core of this source . to get an impression of the possible realistic cooling luminosity , we adopt here a simple phenomenological model , which assumes that the unsuppressed hyperon direct urca process [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] is active in the central region of the core with the radius @xmath53 , where hyperons are present ( see @xcite for a detailed motivation ) .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is3658 ( @xmath54  hz ) can indicate that even more violent cooling is possible .",
    "the observations put an upper limit on the internal temperature @xmath55  k ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the deep crustal heating produces @xmath56  ergs@xmath52 for the average accretion rate @xmath57/yr , reported by @xcite . ] @xmath58 for @xmath59  km the equilibrium temperature of psr b1937 + 21 , at which @xmath60 , can be estimated as @xmath61  k. in the absence of direct urca , the equilibrium temperature becomes larger , so that the source is well inside the instability window ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_minmod ] , where it is shown by the star symbol ) .",
    "note that some other internal heating mechanisms ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) can be competitive with the rotation - induced deep crustal heating , further increasing the temperature of psr b1937@xmath6221 and making it even more unstable .",
    "however , as explained in section [ sec_minmod ] , r - modes rapidly heat up an unstable star ( on a timescale of a century ) and spin it down .",
    "thus , observations of psr b1937@xmath6221 contradict the minimal r - mode instability model : to explain this source one should stabilize it by introducing an additional damping mechanism efficient at @xmath63  k.      the ns temperature is a crucial parameter for the r - mode instability and hence any observational constraint on the stellar temperature can be very important",
    ". a large number of msps has been observed in x - rays , however , the thermal emission from them has been either not detected or detected only from pulsars hot spots ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "thermal emission from the surface is typically not required to fit the x - ray spectrum .",
    "a notable exception is psr j0437@xmath644715 ( @xmath65  hz ) , for which combined analysis of uv and x - ray spectra by @xcite allows to estimate the surface temperature , @xmath66  k. the corresponding internal temperature is @xmath67  k and thus this pulsar is r - mode stable .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested a strong upper limit , @xmath68  k , on the surface temperature of psr j1231 - 1411 ( @xmath69hz ) within the blackbody model .",
    "as the authors emphasize , they do not account for gravitational redshift and ignore the effects related to stellar atmosphere , which can , in our opinion , significantly affect the actual value of the upper limit ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have also proposed upper limits on the surface temperature of several other msps based either on estimates of their total x - ray thermal luminosity ( available in the literature ) or on the results of @xcite , who estimated maximum possible @xmath70 for a number of sources .    here",
    "we suggest a general upper limit on the surface temperatures of msps . for several pulsars ( e.g. , for psr 1937 + 21 )",
    "our upper limit is stronger than that suggested by @xcite .",
    "the msp surface temperatures are strongly constrained by existing observations : if msps were as hot as transiently accreting nss , whose thermal emission is observed in x - rays even in the quiescent state ( see section [ sec_xray ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_minmod ] ) , the thermal emission from the whole msp surface would be detected in x - rays as well .",
    "but it is not the case .",
    "thus , leaving a detailed analysis of x - ray observations for each msp beyond the scope of this paper , we assume that msps should ( generally ) be colder than the transiently accreting nss with the measured surface temperature .",
    "to get an idea of the possible upper limit on the msp surface temperature we rely on observations of mxb 1659@xmath64298 ( assumed distance to the source @xmath71  kpc and x - ray absorption column density @xmath72  cm@xmath50 ) , igr 00291 + 5934 ( @xmath74  kpc and @xmath75  cm@xmath50 ) , and hete j1900.12455 ( @xmath76  kpc and @xmath77  cm@xmath50 ) , reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for all of them the effective surface temperature was estimated as @xmath78  k. note that , for these objects both absorption column density and distances are relatively large in comparison to typical fast msps ( with @xmath79  hz ) .",
    ": @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the dispersion measure .",
    "thus , msps with @xmath82 should have @xmath83  cm@xmath50 , a requirement , which is satisfied for more than @xmath84 of currently known fast msps ( @xmath79  hz ) , according to atnf pulsar catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "this catalogue also gives an information on the pulsar distances , and it turns out that 70% of known fast msps ( @xmath79  hz ) are located closer than hete j1900.12455 , but this statistic is not independent because the pulsar distances are estimated using the @xcite dm - based distance model as default . ]",
    "thus , it is unlikely that lack of successful observations of thermal emission from the whole surface of fast msps can be explained by strong absorption or large distances to these sources : rather , it is more probable that they are ` cold ' ( colder than mxb 1659@xmath64298 , igr 00291 + 5934 , and hete j1900.12455 )",
    ". therefore , we choose @xmath85 as a fiducial upper limit for the effective surface temperature of msps .",
    "this temperature corresponds to the bolometric thermal luminosity @xmath86  ergs@xmath52 [ see equation ( [ l_ph ] ) below ] .",
    "the typical x - ray luminosity of msps is @xmath87  ergs@xmath52 ( @xcite ) and should correspond to even lower surface temperatures .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of msps with high spin - down power is higher .",
    "however , they have power - law x - ray spectrum and high fraction of pulsed emission ( see , e.g. , section 4.2 by @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the internal temperatures , which reveal itself in thermal emission from the whole surface , contributing to the unpulsed component of x - ray emission .",
    "thus , analyzis of the phase - averaged spectra can lead to overestimation of @xmath88 .",
    "for example , for psr b1937 + 21 , which plays an especially important role in this paper , @xmath89  ergs@xmath52 , but it is almost 100% pulsed ( @xcite ) . thus the unpulsed luminosity is much weaker ( numerical upper bound is not reported by @xcite ) , and temperature of this pulsar can hardly exceed the constraint ( [ teffmax ] ) . note that @xcite have likely used total x - ray luminosity ( @xmath90  ergs@xmath52 , quoted in their table 1 ) to obtain an upper limit on the surface temperature of psr b1937 + 21 .",
    "it can be a reason why their result ( @xmath91k , according to their figure 1 ) exceeds ( [ teffmax ] ) .",
    "high upper bounds for the surface temperature of some msps reported by @xcite ( also quoted in table 2 in @xcite ) correspond to pulsars undetected in x - rays ; thus they can not be considered as evidence of violation of ( [ teffmax ] ) .    to further justify our constraint ( [ teffmax ] ) ,",
    "let us consider the globular cluster 47 tuc as an example .",
    "this globular cluster is good for x - ray studies , because it is close ( @xmath92  kpc ) and weakly absorbed ( cluster @xmath93  cm@xmath50 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported on the observations of three qlmxbs in this cluster , including the source w17 with @xmath94  k , and confirmed that nss with such surface temperature are observable .",
    "@xcite found x - ray counterparts for all 19 msps with precisely known positions in this globular cluster ( msp pairs 47 tuc f and s , and g and i were treated as single sources ) .",
    "many msps [ including 47 tuc j ( @xmath95  hz ) , y ( @xmath96  hz ) , and w ( @xmath97  hz ) , which were the fastest msps in this globular cluster known at that moment ]  hz .",
    "however , its position has not been determined yet , thus we are unable to identify it among the x - ray point sources catalogued by @xcite . ]",
    "were well described by a purely thermal spectrum or composite thermal and power - law emission .",
    "the size of thermally emitting area was small ( @xmath98  km for the hydrogen atmosphere model ) .",
    "x - ray spectra for four relatively slow rotating msps [ namely , 47 tuc d ( @xmath99  hz ) , e ( @xmath100  hz ) , l ( @xmath101  hz ) , and r ( @xmath102  hz ) ] require a two - temperature model .",
    "@xcite pointed out , that limited statistics do not allow to put reliable constraints on the emission areas , but x - ray spectra can be fitted with the same two temperatures as used in @xcite for psr j04374715 , with the low ( nonredshifted ) surface temperature @xmath103  k corresponding to the emission radius @xmath104  km .",
    "note that this temperature agrees with our upper limit ( [ teffmax ] ) and the emission area is much smaller than the size of a ns .",
    "thus , the whole surface for these msps should have even lower temperatures ( otherwise the corresponding emission would be required by the fit ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the thermal emission from all msps in 47 tuc can , in fact , consist of two components ; if correct , this means that the effective temperatures and emission radii obtained within a single thermal component model represent a weighted averages of two emitting regions .",
    "this may indicate that the thermal emission from the whole msp surface should not exceed the total thermal emission , which was estimated by @xcite as @xmath105  ergs@xmath52 .",
    "it suggests that even stronger upper bound can be put on the surface temperature of msps in 47 tuc .",
    "however , in this paper we shall adopt the conservative general upper limit ( [ teffmax ] ) and demonstrate that even it constrains the r - mode instability window .",
    "it is quite likely that accurate and detailed analysis of x - ray and uv observational data can put even tighter upper bounds on the temperatures of the observed msps , allowing one to apply the analysis of sections [ sec_tiny][sec_gen ] to extract more information about the properties of these sources .    for stars with accreted envelope composition ( a reasonable option ,",
    "since they were recycled by accretion ) , , even if actual layer of light elements is very thin ( see , e.g. , fig .  8 in @xcite ) . ]",
    "equation ( [ teffmax ] ) translates into the following condition on the redshifted internal stellar temperature , @xmath106 ( see hatched region in fig .  [ fig_minmod ] ) .",
    "this condition indicates that the fastest msps ( with @xmath107  hz ) can be unstable within the minimal r - mode instability model .",
    "thus , to describe them , an additional damping is likely required in this temperature region .",
    "within the tiny r - mode amplitude scenario , nss can be unstable , but saturation amplitudes are chosen small enough to agree with observations . @xcite confronted this model with the observations of nss in lmxbs and concluded that the r - mode amplitudes should range from @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "@xcite apply msp timing to constrain r - mode amplitudes in msps . for some msps with the slowest spin - down rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "[ shklovskii ] ] assuming power - law dependence of relevant parameters on @xmath16 , @xmath7 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , they suggest ` universal r - mode spin - down limit '  on gravitational wave signal from msps",
    ". however , at least for neutrino luminosity this assumption seems to be oversimplified : simulations of stellar cooling and quiescent temperatures of accreting nss require different cooling mechanisms to be active in nss with different masses leading to very strong ( non - power - law ) dependence of luminosity on the mass and temperature [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] . thus , universal r - mode spin - down limit suggested by @xcite should be treated with a bit of caution .",
    "furthermore , as we demonstrate below , upper boundary ( [ teffmax ] ) for the surface temperature of msps can constrain the r - mode amplitudes much stronger .",
    "this is in line with @xcite who have recently come to the similar conclusion .    for saturated r - mode",
    ", the heating power can be estimated from equation ( [ heatrate ] ) . in thermal equilibrium the total heating ( sum of all heating mechanisms : r - mode , rotation induced deep crustal heating , rotochemical heating , etc . ) should be compensated by cooling . if an msp is not massive enough to open direct urca process in its core , the neutrino emission is likely to become negligible [ due to temperature constraint ( [ tmax ] ) ] , so that the total cooling luminosity can be estimated as the thermal emission from the msp surface @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . here and below the red - shift factor , @xmath112 ,",

    "the upper limit ( [ a_gen ] ) on the r - mode amplitude in msps is too strong to be explained by previously suggested mechanisms of nonlinear saturation of r - modes ( the only exception is the work by @xcite , but it assumes a hybrid star with sharp hadron - quark interface and thus it is inapplicable to hadronic equations of state ) .",
    "note also that the saturation amplitude generally increases with temperature decrease ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , an upper limit for the low - temperature msps is , in fact , a stronger constraint than numerically the same upper limit for hot nss in lmxbs .",
    "hence , explanation of msps in the tiny r - mode scenario seems to be unrealistic .    in the end of the section it is worth noting that the estimates obtained above constrain the r - mode amplitude even if it is limited not by saturation , but by the shape of the instability window ( e.g. , within the resonance uplift scenario , see sections [ sec_reson ] and [ sec_gen ] )",
    "as discussed in section [ sec_observ ] , shear viscosity is not sufficient to stabilize r - modes in the observed nss .",

    "the enhanced neutrino emission , leading to problems with explanation of hot nss in lmxbs , should be common for models , which stabilize nss by the bulk viscosity .",
    "the reason is simple : both neutrino luminosity and bulk viscosity are associated with the reactions between the particles in the ns core ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . if all these reactions are accompanied by neutrino production ( as it is the case for nucleonic matter )",
    ", there should be a direct correspondence between the bulk viscosity ( for small - amplitude oscillations ) and neutrino emissivity ( see , for example , equations 1 and 2 in @xcite , written for the modified urca reactions ) .",
    "this means that enhancement of bulk viscosity unavoidably results in an enhancement of neutrino luminosity .    for more complicated core compositions ( e.g. , for nucleon - hyperon or quark matter ) non - leptonic reactions",
    "are possible ( e.g. , @xcite ) that do not involve neutrinos and , being more powerful than neutrino reactions , produce dominant contribution to the bulk viscosity ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the ratio of the bulk viscosity energy dissipation rate to luminosity can be enhanced in comparison to the nucleonic matter .",
    "however , to stabilize the fastest nss in lmxbs , like 4u 1608 - 522 , bulk viscosity should be enhanced at least by 13 orders of magnitude ( cf .",
    "equations [ tau_gw ] and [ tau_b ] ) , which seems to be hardly possible without substantial increase of the neutrino luminosity . at the same time , if all nss in lmxbs are r - mode stable , the quiescent temperatures of the hottest of them can be explained _ only _ if neutrino luminosity is not too strong , i.e. , it should be on the level of the modified urca luminosity for nucleonic cores ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the above arguments are , of course , not rigorous enough , but we want to stress that each particular model with r - mode stabilization by enhanced bulk viscosity should be checked for consistency with the observed quiescent temperatures of the hottest nss in lmxbs ( in particular , 4u 1608 - 522 ) .",
    "resonance uplift scenario was suggested by @xcite to explain observations of nss in lmxbs .",
    "it is based on the proper account of finite temperature effects on the dynamics of superfluid liquid in the core and predicts an enhanced ns stability associated with the resonance interaction of oscillation modes in the vicinity of certain ( resonance ) temperatures ( see fig.[fig_uplift ] , where the instability window is splitted by stability peaks ) . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", this picture agrees with detailed calculations of frequencies and damping times for : ( i ) r - modes and inertial modes of superfluid nss at zero temperature ( @xcite ) ; and ( ii ) f- and p - modes in nonrotating superfluid nss at finite temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite confirm the main features of the resonance uplift scenario by calculating the r - mode spectrum and damping times for a finite - temperature superfluid ns within a simplified model with vanishing entrainment .",
    "however , the form of the stability peaks depends on many parameters ( e.g. , on the critical temperature profiles , equation of state etc . ) and remains rather uncertain . here",
    "we shall try to constrain it by making use of the observations discussed in section [ sec_observ ] .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the fastest msps should be attached to the left slopes of some of the existing stability peaks .",

    "broad _ low - temperature stability peaks [ see panel ( b ) and section [ sec_broad ] ] .    formally , both models can explain the current state of the observed rapidly rotating nss : each ns in an lmxb is either attached to the left slope of some stability peak ( e.g. , 4u 1608 - 522 ) or is stable with respect to r - modes ( e.g. , xte j1814 - 338 ) , as it should be in the resonance uplift scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high - frequency msps [ with @xmath141  hz for model ( a ) and @xmath127  hz for model ( b ) ] can be explained as moving along the left slope of the low - temperature stability peak , other msps should be stable . in both cases ,",
    "msp temperatures agree with observations ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "spin frequency evolution is almost unaffected by r - modes even for high - frequency msps ( see a discussion after equation [ a_gen ] ) .",
    "however , the recycling scenario requires that msps should be formed in lmxbs . in the following subsection we analyse constraints on the models ( a ) and ( b ) set by this requirement .",
    "note that , generally , the resonance temperatures can depend not only on the microphysics input ( i.e. , on the equation of state , critical temperature profile , etc . ) , but also on the stellar mass ( e.g. , the appearance of hyperons in sufficiently massive nss can change the form of the instability window dramatically ) .",
    "thus , we can not exclude that both possibilities ( a ) and ( b ) are realized for different ns masses .",
    "typical evolution path , which should lead to formation of low - temperature msps within the model ( a ) , is shown by solid line in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_uplift ] . according to the resonant uplift scenario",
    "( see @xcite for details ) , at the initial stage of recycling , an ns is stable and spun up by accretion ; its temperature is determined by the balance between the deep crustal heating and cooling processes [ @xmath36 , where @xmath41 is the solution to equation ( [ teq ] ) ] . if spin up is strong enough , ns can cross the boundary of the stability region .",
    "this leads to excitation of r - mode and accompanying heating of a star . as a result , its temperature increases",
    "however , growth of the temperature is limited by the boundary of the stability peak , because inside the peak the star is stable and does not have a heat source to further increase @xmath143 . as a consequence ,",

    "the exact numerical value of the equilibrium spin rate should be determined from the accretion theory , but it is still a subject of debates ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the standard model assumes that the spin equilibrium takes place when keplerian disc corotates with ns at the magnetosphere boundary",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) @xmath153 here @xmath154 is the dipolar magnetic moment of the star ; @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the numerical coefficients , which describe radius of the magnetosphere and spin - up efficiency .",
    "@xmath157 for @xmath158 gives an upper limit on the equilibrium frequency , because , as noted by @xcite , for higher spin frequency the centrifugal force prevents accretion ( the so called `` propeller regime '' ) so that further spin up of a ns is unlikely .",

    "they follow from the recycling scenario and observations of ( a ) nss in lmxbs ( section [ sec_xray ] ) , ( b ) msp timing ( section [ sec_timing ] ) and ( c ) uv and x - ray observations of msps ( section [ sec_xray_msp ] ) . analysing the observational sets ( a ) and ( b ) , which have already been used to put an upper bound on the r - mode instability by several authors , we emphasize the importance of two points : ( i ) any successful model should not only suppress the instability for nss observed in lmxbs , but",
    "also explain their temperatures ( this is especially important for models based on an enhanced bulk viscosity , see section [ sec_bulk ] ) ; ( ii ) observations of psr b1937 + 21 provide a new evidence of additional dissipation of r - modes at low temperatures , because the internal heating mechanisms [ superfluid vortex creep ( @xcite ) , rotochemical heating ( @xcite ) , and rotation - induced deep crustal heating ( @xcite ) ] are likely to be strong enough for psr b1937 + 21 to make it unstable within the minimal r - mode instability model .",
    "additional constraint comes from the observational set ( c ) , which allows us to put an upper limit on the internal msp temperature , @xmath243  k , limiting thus the maximum possible r - mode amplitude in msps ( section [ sec_tiny ] ) .",
    "these results qualitatively agree with similar conclusions of @xcite .",
    "combined with the recycling scenario of msp formation , the temperature upper limit ( [ tmax ] ) allow us to conclude that the r - mode instability should be suppressed in the whole msp frequency range ( @xmath233  hz ) at temperatures @xmath244  k ( see cross - hatched region in fig .  [ fig_uplift](b ) and section [ sec_gen ] for details ) .",
    "this necessary condition can be used to quickly check for consistency various instability windows available in the literature . in particular",
    ", it can be fulfilled in the resonance uplift scenario suggested by @xcite ( see section [ sec_reson ] for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "it is worth noting , that constraining the surface temperature of the fastest msps by detailed analysis of x - ray and uv observational data can be a very interesting task .",
    "it is very likely that such analysis can put much more stringent upper limits on the surface temperatures of individual sources , than our general upper limit @xmath245  k ( see section [ sec_xray_msp ] , and @xcite ) .",
    "this can make the r - mode instability even more tightly constrained . in the opposite case , if one observes an msp with higher temperature , it will be even more important , because it will present an almost direct evidence of r - mode instability in such pulsar : the thermal emission from the surface @xmath246  ergs@xmath52 should have an energy source and the r - mode instability seems to be the most natural ` energy supplier ' in the absence of accretion .",

    "<S> to put new constraints on the r - mode instability window , we analyse formation of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) within the recycling scenario , making use of three sets of observations : ( a ) x - ray observations of neutron stars ( nss ) in low - mass x - ray binaries ; ( b ) timing of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) ; and ( c ) x - ray and uv observations of msps . as shown in previous works , r - mode dissipation by shear viscosity is not sufficient to explain observational set ( a ) , and enhanced r - mode dissipation at internal temperatures @xmath0  k is required to stabilize the observed nss . here </S>",
    "<S> we argue , that models with enhanced bulk viscosity can hardly lead to a self - consistent explanation of observational set ( a ) due to strong neutrino emission , which is typical for these models ( unrealistically powerful energy source is required to keep nss at the observed temperatures ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the observational set ( b ) requires enhanced r - mode dissipation at low temperatures , @xmath1  k. observational set ( c ) allows us to set an upper limit on the red - shifted internal temperatures of msps , @xmath2  k ( assuming a canonical ns with the accreted crust ) . </S>",
    "<S> recycling scenario can produce msps at these temperatures only if r - mode instability is suppressed in the whole msp spin frequency range ( @xmath3  hz ) at temperatures @xmath4  k , providing thus a new constraint on the r - mode instability window . </S>",
