    "nevertheless , the first signatures of the occurrence of such exotic excitations was reported in quasi - one - dimensional semiconductor nanowires @xcite .",

    "the experimental evidence of such quasiparticles @xcite was realized by means of tunnel spectroscopy .",

    "the appearance of a zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) in the nonlinear conductance is ascribed to the majorana physics .",
    "nevertheless , recently it has been pointed out that other sources of zba in normal - superconductor nanowires can occur .",
    "for instance , kondo physics or shiba states @xcite or even nearly zero energy andreev states @xcite and weak antilocalization @xcite can not be discarded as explanations of the observed zbas .",
    "therefore , the detection of the mfs is now a dire challenge .",
    "most of schemes for the detection up to now are exploiting the electronic transport involving the mfs . and",
    "only very recently the thermoelectric properties of majorana fermion are examined and suggested for another way to distinguish majorana physics from other explanations @xcite .",
    "since the mf has the particle - hole symmetry itself , thermoelectric devices involving only the mf can not generate any temperature - driven charge current nor electric - field - driven heat current .",
    "hence , an additional quantum object which breaks the particle - hole symmetry should be incorporated .",
    "the recent studies @xcite have coupled the mf to the simplest quantum object , that is , a spinless quantum dot ( qd ) and controlled the particle - hole symmetry by tuning the dot level .",
    "it turns out that the mf can give rise to a non - trivial thermoelectric response upon a thermal bias across the qd @xcite .",

    "the electric response to a temperature gradient , in nanostructures , can achieve much bigger values in efficiency compared with macroscopic samples @xcite .",
    "the main reason for such high heat - to - electricity conversion factors resides in the intrinsic quantum property of energy level discretization for confined systems @xcite .",

    "note that this central peak has the opposite asymmetry with respect to that in the weak - coupling regime .",

    "the only difference between the weak- and strong - coupling regimes is whether the dip is so narrow as to be confined inside the kondo resonance peak or wide enough to suppress it .",

    "[ fig : sf : neg](a ) ] so that the sign of the sf - induced peak is reversed [ see fig .  [",

    "therefore , as reflected in figs .",
    "[ fig : sf ] and [ fig : sf : neg ] , the sf case with finite @xmath44 can not reproduce the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in the mf case with finite @xmath44 . hence , the observed features of @xmath0 in the mf case are genuine effects only the mf can generate .",
    "the reason why the mf and sf cases become distinguishable from each other for @xmath185 is that the mf state is particle - hole symmetric while the sf state is not . in the mf case the only source of the asymmetry",
    "is the kondo effect while in the sf case the sf level can also make the system asymmetric . for @xmath152 this difference did not show up since the levels are at the fermi level and particle - hole symmetric",
    "in the previous sections it is shown that the mf adds additional peaks to the temperature dependence of @xmath0 . since the mf is particle - hole symmetric , the finite @xmath0 is attributed to the asymmetry of the kondo resonance peak , or in other words , nonzero @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , by tuning the value of @xmath186 or the gate voltage on the qd , the magnitude and the sign of @xmath0 can be controlled . in this section",
    "we investigate the gate dependence of @xmath0 in the kondo regime .    before addressing the weak- and strong - coupling regimes separately ,",

    "in fact , the peak due to the restored kondo effect is shifted as @xmath186 is varied [ see fig .  [",
