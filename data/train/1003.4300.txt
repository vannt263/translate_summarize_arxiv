    "we will use the following three models to model the electromagnetic dis structure functions @xmath20 :    * * model i * : the model used in @xcite utilized the resonance parameters obtained in @xcite and the non - resonant regge contribution from @xcite that was fitted to the real photon data at high energies .",
    "@xcite also provides the @xmath21-dependence of the high - energy part , so no additional modelling was necessary here . for the estimates of @xcite , a simple dipole model with the dipole mass @xmath22 gev for all the transition resonance form factors",
    "was employed .",
    "* * model ii * : another form of resonance and background contributions and transition form factors was used in @xcite to fit virtual photon data . * * model iii * : as fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmatot ] clearly demonstrates , the background of @xcite can not be used too far beyond the resonance region .",
    "therefore , we opt for model iii that uses the background from model i , and adopt the resonance contribution from model ii .    in figs . [",
    "fig : sigmatot ] and [ fig : resdata1 ] , we display the comparison of the three models with the data for the differential cross section for inclusive electroproduction in the resonance region . the model i @xcite is shown by solid red lines , model ii by the solid blue line , and model iii",
    "is represented by a long - dash red line . from fig .",
    "[ fig : resdata1 ] it becomes clear that model i largely underestimates the jlab data in the whole resonance region , apart from the real photon point fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmatot ] .",
    "model iii also provides a very good description of the dis data for @xmath23 at low and moderate values of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "once the parameters are fixed , we can employ simple isospin considerations for each contribution . note that because breaking down the experimental data into the sum of resonances and background is a model - dependent procedure , also the isospin rotation is only defined within a given model . for the @xmath24 transition",
    ", the isospin decomposition resembles that for the elastic form factors , @xmath25 it is then straightforward to relate the contribution of a resonance @xmath26 with isospin @xmath27 to the interference @xmath0 `` cross section '' , to its contribution to the electromagnetic cross section by introducing the isospin scaling factors _ z/^r&=&(1 - 4s^2_w ) - above , @xmath28 are the transition helicity amplitudes for exciting the resonance @xmath26 on the proton ( neutron ) , respectively , whereas @xmath29 denotes the contribution of the resonance @xmath26 to the transverse virtual photon cross section .",
    "the scaling factors @xmath30 depend both on the relative size and relative phase of the transition amplitude on the proton and on the neutron . to obtain both , we use the results of the constituent quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the transition helicity amplitudes . for isovector transitions",
    "@xmath31 , the scaling factor in the sm is @xmath32 .",
    "vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) capitalizes on the fact that the photon ( @xmath33-boson ) has the same quantum numbers as vector mesons and can be represented as a superposition of a few vector mesons , @xmath34 . in the naive vdm",
    ", these three channels can not mix among each other , and one obtains a prediction for the ratios of the cross sections of @xmath35 production , @xmath36 , where we defined @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the above predictions were confronted to the experimental data at high energies and for @xmath21 that ranged from zero to several gev@xmath40 @xcite and showed a very good agreement for the @xmath41 ratio , while for the @xmath42 ratio the agreement was not as good .",
    "accomodating these considerations here , we obtain the following ratio of the high energy non - resonant ( nr ) contributions to @xmath43 and @xmath44 cross sections : _",
    "z/^nr & & = 2(1 - 4 ^ 2_w)[eq : xinr ] where we make use of the sm definition @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we summarize these results intable [ tab ] .",
    "we next discuss the size and origin of the uncertainty in calculating re@xmath49 .",
    "it comes about from i ) modeling the electromagnetic data , and ii ) from the respective isospin structure . to estimate the former , we average over the three models discussed above and displayed in fig . [",
    "fig : deltagz ] , leading to re@xmath50% , with most of the error bar due to the model i. because the latter underestimates the experimental data throughout the resonance region for non - zero @xmath21 , it is clear that this estimate represents an upper bound for the model dependence .",
    "in an upcoming work , we plan to directly fit the parameters of model iii to the data that will allow to significantly reduce the model - dependent error , given the quality of the experimental data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigmatot ] , [ fig : resdata1 ] .",
    "the isospin structure represents a more significant source of uncertainty .",
    "we will next indicate , to what precision the isospin scaling factors of table [ tab ] should be constrained to keep the uncertainty of re@xmath49 under control . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , it is seen that contributions of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 resonances have very little impact on the size of the dispersion correction .",
    "we can therefore afford to assign a conservative uncertainty of 50% to each .",
    "@xmath55 has been studied in many phenomenological models , and we believe that it is realistic to constrain the scaling factor @xmath56 to better than 20% that would translate into 0.25% for the dispersion correction . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the isospin structure might be more complex , since it couples strongly to @xmath58 states along with @xmath59 , but the absolute size of the correction quoted in table [ tab2 ] allows for a larger relative uncertainty here . constraining @xmath60 to relative 30% would lead to 0.13% for @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we turn to the uncertainties associated with the higher energy contributions .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the contribution associated in @xcite with a resonance around @xmath61mev can not be ultimately identified with the @xmath62 state listed in pdg @xcite .",
    "this contribution may represent a missing strength of the background at @xmath63mev that can be seen in the two lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : resdata1 ] , rather than a real resonance .",
    "constraining this contribution to relative 50% means 0.25% for @xmath10 . for the background ,",
    "we assign the 100% uncertainty to the strange quarks contribution to the scaling factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xinr ] ) , @xmath64 . putting the above discussion together",
    ", we write _ z(=1.165gev)&=&(5.850.45_mod1.23_iso)% .",
    "we conclude that the main uncertainty to the dispersion correction comes from the isospin decomposition of the electromagnetic data , most notably from high energy background .",
    "we showed how the total uncertainty can be represented as an uncertainty in the four isospin scaling parameters , @xmath65 , @xmath56 , @xmath60 and @xmath66 .",
    "the estimates of uncertainties in these factors that we presented are only approximate , and will be studied in greater detail in an upcoming work in order to ensure the interpretability of the qweak experiment .",
