    "the importance of resonant scattering by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was described by gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) , who used the lack of a strong absorption trough in the spectra of high - redshift quasars to set limits on the amount of dispersed .",
    "lynds ( 1971 ) noted that in the spectra of distant quasars there are many absorption features blueward of the ly@xmath0 emission line ; he interpreted the absorption features as ly@xmath0 lines produced by intervening material . the mean absorption in the ly@xmath0 forest depends mainly on the gas density and the amplitude of the ionising background ( rauch et al .",
    "1997 ; rauch 1998 ) .",
    "the absorption increases rapidly with increasing redshift @xmath5 ( e.g. , schneider , schmidt & gunn 1991 ; songaila & cowie 2002 ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath6 for a gas consisting primarily of ionized hydrogen and singly ionized helium , which is at density @xmath7 relative to the background density @xmath8 and is in photo - ionization equilibrium at redshift @xmath5 , is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the baryon density , @xmath11",
    "km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 is hubble s constant , @xmath13 is the matter density , and @xmath14 is the helium abundance by mass ( e.g. peebles 1993 , ",
    "the temperature of the gas is @xmath15 , and @xmath16 s@xmath12 is the photo - ionization rate .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) suggests that @xmath6 should evolve rapidly .",
    "various authors ( e.g. , jenkins & ostriker 1991 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) have noted that measurements of the mean transmission @xmath17 and its evolution constrain the parameters in equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) , such as the ratio @xmath18 ( rauch 1998 ) , and the evolution of @xmath19 ( mcdonald & miralda - escud 2001 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) shows that , after the reionization of , the optical depth is expected to decrease smoothly with time , unless , for example , there is a sudden injection of energy into the igm .",
    "for instance , if the temperature of the gas increases by a factor of two at some epoch , then equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) suggests that the optical depth @xmath6 in the ly@xmath0 forest would decrease by a factor of @xmath20 .",
    "there is some evidence of a factor of two change in the temperature of the igm at @xmath21 ( e.g. schaye et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "reimers et al .",
    "( 1997 ; also see heap et al .",
    "2000 ; kriss et al .",
    "2001 ) found evidence for a sharp increase in the  opacity around @xmath22 , which they associated with  reionization .",
    "songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) and songaila ( 1998 ) have argued that the observed evolution of /metal line ratios requires a sudden hardening of the ionizing background around @xmath22 , which is consistent with  reionization .",
    "schaye et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and theuns et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) showed that   reionization at @xmath23 results in a jump of about a factor of two in the temperature of the igm at the mean density , and found evidence for such a jump by studying the distribution of line - widths in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "in addition , schaye et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and ricotti , gnedin & shull ( 2000 ) found that the gas is close to isothermal at redshift @xmath22 , indicating that a second reheating of the intergalactic medium took place at @xmath22 .",
    "this too might be interpreted as evidence of the reionization of .",
    "( numerical simulations of the observational signatures of  ionization are also presented in e.g. , meiksin 1994 and croft et al .",
    "however , boxenberg ( 1998 ) and kim , cristiani , & dodorico ( 2002 ) found no change in / , and analyses by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and zaldarriaga , hui , & tegmark ( 2001 ) did not find a significant temperature change at these redshifts .",
    "thus , both from metal line ratios , and from measurements of line widths , there is some evidence for  reionization at @xmath21 , and that this event is associated with an increase in the temperature of the igm , although the strength of the evidence is still being questioned .",
    "if  were ionized at @xmath21 , and this caused the temperature of the igm to increase by a factor of two , then our simple estimate of an associated sixty percent decrease in @xmath6 is not quite right .",
    "for instance , it ignores the fact that the extra electron liberated by the ionization can increase the optical depth .",
    "however , for @xmath24 , the increase in the electron density from the electron released by   ionization can increase @xmath6 only by seven or eight percent .",
    "although this goes in the opposite direction to the effect of the temperature increase , it is a substantially smaller effect . other important factors , which the simple sixty - percent estimate ignores , include the facts that the temperature change may be accompanied by a change in the temperature  density relation of the gas ; that saturated lines which contribute to the optical depth will not be as strongly affected by a temperature change ; and that a temperature increase may expand the gas , thus affecting peculiar velocities and complicating the relationship between temperature , line profile and optical depth .",
    "nevertheless , the discussion above indicates that a sudden change in the temperature of the igm may well be accompanied by a sudden change in the optical depth , although a precise estimate of the magnitude of the effect requires hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "a sudden change in @xmath6 means that the ratio of the mean absorption in the ly@xmath0 forest to that in the spectrum of the quasar ( hereafter qso ) should also change abruptly at the same time .",
    "that is , the quantity defined by oke & korycansky ( 1982 ) , @xmath25 should show a feature at @xmath21 if  was ionized at that time .",
    "an advantage of studying the mean absorption , @xmath26 , or transmission , @xmath27 , is that it can be measured even in low resolution spectra for which individual line measurements are not possible .",
    "it is conventional to use the mean transmission to define an effective optical depth : @xmath28 .",
    "schneider , schmidt & gunn ( 1991 ) show that the mean transmission evolves significantly over the range @xmath29 ( also see press , rybicki & schneider 1993 ) . the main goal of this paper is to see if this evolution is smooth , or has a feature in it .",
    "for example , we would like to see if there is any evidence of a sudden drop in the effective optical depth in the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath21 .",
    "section  [ selection ] describes how we selected our sample of @xmath30 qsos from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database .",
    "the sdss qso selection algorithm itself is studied in some detail in appendix  [ seffects ] .",
    "we will be searching for a feature in the evolution of the mean transmission ; this requires an accurate determination of the underlying intrinsic qso spectrum .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ contfit ] .",
    "we use two methods to do this .",
    "one method , which is a direct descendent of the one first used by oke & korycansky ( 1982 ) , is described in appendix  [ method2 ] .",
    "the other is new ; it exploits the fact that the continuum is a function of restframe wavelength , whereas the ly@xmath0 effective optical depth is a function of observed wavelength .",
    "both methods yield consistent results ",
    "the inferred continuum between the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath31 emission lines is not featureless , and , at @xmath32 , there appears to be a feature in the otherwise smooth evolution of the mean transmission , and hence of @xmath33 .",
    "possible systematic effects which might affect our measurement are discussed in section  [ tauz ] and in appendix  [ seffects ] .",
    "a final section summarizes our findings .",
    "appendix  [ app : skew ] is somewhat tangential to the main subject of this paper : it is a short demonstration of some effects which arise from the fact that the distribution of flux decrements in the ly@xmath0 forest is highly non - gaussian .",
    "a comparison of this measurement with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations shows that our measurements can be interpreted as evidence for  reionization at @xmath3 ( theuns et al .",
    "the implications for the evolution of the temperature of the igm and the photo - ionization rate @xmath34 will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the sample of qsos used in this paper was extracted from the sdss database ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) which included all the spectra observed by the sdss collaboration through the end of 2001 .",
    "this sample is about three times larger than that in the sdss early data release ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the sdss camera is described in gunn et al .",
    "1998 , and the filter response curves are described in fukugita et al . (",
    "the sdss photometric reduction procedure is described in lupton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the spectroscopic data reduction procedure will be described in frieman et al .",
    "the sdss procedure for targeting qsos is described in detail in richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "when we selected our sample , the sdss had imaged @xmath35 square degrees , and @xmath36 qsos had both photometric and spectroscopic information .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic pipeline identifies any extragalactic object whose spectrum is dominated by a non - stellar continuum and has at least one broad emission line ( rest - frame fwhm larger than @xmath37  kms@xmath12 ) as a candidate qso ( frieman et al .",
    "thus , the sample of @xmath36 objects includes seyfert galaxies and some `` type 2 '' agns as well as qsos .",
    "all of these spectra were examined visually to make certain that the redshift was correctly assigned .",
    "spectra with broad absorption line features ( bal qsos ) for which it was not possible to measure a redshift are not included in the above .",
    "we are interested in compiling a sample of objects in which the ly@xmath0 forest can be easily detected .",
    "the requirement that the entire forest ( restframe wavelength @xmath38   ) be detected in the sdss spectrum of an object sets a lower limit of @xmath39 on the redshift of the qsos we will analyze . in turn , this sets a limit of about @xmath40 on the redshift range in which we can study the ly-@xmath0 forest . in practice , there is a problem with the flux calibration of the sdss spectra at the blue end of the spectrograph ( wavelengths shorter than 4400 , see appendix  [ app : civ ] .",
    "therefore , we only show results at slightly higher redshifts , which are not affected by this . of the @xmath36 qso  candidate objects above , about @xmath41 are at @xmath42 .",
    "about 250 of these had spectra with unusually broad absorption lines ( bals ) , or strong damped ly@xmath0 systems , and/or had low quality spectra , so we removed them from our sample .",
    "the instrumental resolution of the sdss spectrograph is about @xmath43  kms@xmath12 .",
    "studies of higher resolution qso spectra show that most lines in the ly@xmath0 forest are substantially narrower than this .",
    "therefore , a typical line in the ly@xmath0 forest is unresolved in our data .",
    "in addition , the sdss qso spectra have a median @xmath44 per pixel of @xmath45 , and this ratio drops to @xmath46 in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "therefore , for the sdss sample , measuring the parameters of individual ly@xmath0 lines as a function of redshift is not the best way to estimate the temperature evolution of the igm .",
    "a better approach is to measure the mean transmission of the flux in the ly@xmath0 forest , @xmath27 , as a function of redshift .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : da ] ) shows that the crucial step is to determine the qso continuum precisely . to do so",
    ", we must have a reasonably long restframe wavelength range which is common to all the objects in our sample  we require that the restframe range @xmath47    be detected in all the spectra we will include in our sample .",
    "this sets an upper limit @xmath48 on the redshifts of the objects we will include in our analysis .",
    "this requirement removed an additional @xmath49 objects , leaving 1061 qso spectra in our sample ; two examples are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "in what follows , it will be useful to think of the observed flux in the spectrum of the @xmath50th qso ( shifted to the restframe of the qso and normalized in some standard fashion which we will discuss shortly ) as @xmath51\\ ,            \\bigl[t(z_\\alpha ) + \\ t_i(z_\\alpha)\\bigr ]              + n_i(\\lambda_{obs}),\\qquad { \\rm where}\\qquad             1+z_\\alpha \\equiv { \\lambda_{obs}\\over \\lambda_\\alpha }                       = { \\lambda_{rest}(1+z_i)\\over 1215.67},\\ ] ] @xmath52 is the redshift of the qso and @xmath53   . here",
    "@xmath54 represents the mean continuum at fixed rest wavelength , which we think of as being representative of the qso population at @xmath52 as a whole ( if qsos evolve , then the mean continuum of the population may depend on redshift ) , and @xmath55 represents the fact that the continuum of the @xmath50th qso might be different from the mean at that redshift .",
    "( @xmath55 could also differ from one qso to another if relativistic outflows from qsos are common .",
    "see richards et al .",
    "1999 and references therein for evidence of such relativistic velocities . )",
    "similarly , @xmath56 $ ] is the mean transmission through the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath57 , averaged over all the @xmath57 pixels in the forest ( note that @xmath33 is a function of @xmath57 , and hence of the observed rather than restframe wavelength ) , and @xmath58 represents the fact that the transmission through the forest along the @xmath50th line of sight might be different from the mean value .",
    "the final term @xmath59 represents the noise in the observation . by definition @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where the average over @xmath55 is over fixed @xmath62 , and the average of @xmath58 is over fixed @xmath57 , and hence over fixed @xmath63 .",
    "we will assume that , at fixed @xmath63 , @xmath64 also .",
    "we have written the observed flux in this way to emphasize the fact that the mean continuum @xmath54 is a function of @xmath62 , whereas the mean transmission @xmath65 is a function of @xmath63 .",
    "it is this fact which makes it possible , at least in principle , to disentangle the two unknown functions @xmath54 and @xmath66 from the single observed quantity , @xmath67 .",
    "all work to date first estimates @xmath68 , and then averages all the @xmath69 which have the same @xmath57 to estimate the mean transmission .",
    "that is , the shape of the continuum is determined separately for each qso .",
    "this is easier to do at low redshifts @xmath70 where absorption by the forest is smaller , but it is considerably more difficult at higher redshifts .",
    "furthermore , if the resolution of the spectrograph is low and/or the signal - to - noise ratio is poor , then systematic errors in the estimated continuum can arise ( steidel & sargent 1987 )",
    ". biases can also arise if some fraction of the absorption is not due to  but to other elements .",
    "this extra absorption becomes increasingly important at lower redshifts , as the ly@xmath0  opacity decreases more rapidly than the opacity of the metals .",
    "for example , at @xmath71 , approximately 20% of the total absorption in the ly@xmath0  forest is not due to   ( kulkarni et al . 1996 ; rauch 1998 ) .",
    "our sample is confined to high enough redshifts that this should not be a significant concern , although , as we discuss later , absorption by elements other than  may be important when comparing our measurements to results from higher resolution spectra .",
    "our spectra have low resolution and signal - to - noise , so an object - by - object estimate of the continuum is difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "our sample is very large , so we can take a statistical approach .",
    "consider qsos in a small redshift range .",
    "the qsos have a range of luminosities , and so the set of spectra in any one redshift bin can differ considerably from each other .",
    "when suitably normalized , however , the differences between spectra are reduced significantly .",
    "therefore , following press , rybicki & schneider ( 1993 ) and zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we normalize each spectrum by the flux in the rest wavelength range @xmath72   .",
    "( this wavelength range lies in front of the emission line , and is free of obvious emission and absorption lines . )",
    "having normalized each observed spectrum we compute the average value of the normalized flux @xmath73 to obtain a composite spectrum .",
    "this composite is @xmath74 where we have assumed that the averages @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , evaluated at fixed @xmath62 and qso redshift are all zero . for a sufficiently large sample ,",
    "these averages probably are vanishingly small , so we can interpret the measured composite spectrum as the product of the mean continuum times the desired mean transmission . because @xmath79 , this estimate of the mean transmission differs from the usual one by the second term : @xmath80 . if the transmission @xmath69 in the @xmath50th spectrum is not correlated with how different the continuum of the @xmath50th qso is compared to the average continuum , @xmath81 , then this second term can be written as two separate averages . in this case , @xmath82 because @xmath83 .",
    "if qsos at the same redshift have a wide variety of spectra , then the composite spectrum could be very different from the spectrum of any individual object , thus making our estimates of the mean transmission blueward of @xmath84 very noisy .",
    "therefore , we carried out a principle component analysis ( pca ; e.g. , francis et al .",
    "1992 ) of the spectra in the wavelength range @xmath85   .",
    "figure  [ fig : pca ] shows the first four components ( or eigen - spectra ) determined by the pca for the qsos in the redshift range @xmath86 ( the other redshift bins show similar eigen - spectra ) .",
    "the first component ( upper left panel ) represents the intervals @xmath87    and @xmath88    well .",
    "the next @xmath89 components are mainly necessary for reproducing the exact shape of the ly@xmath0 and emission lines .",
    "in particular , because the flux density of these higher order components is close to zero in the @xmath87    and @xmath88    wavelength regions , the pca analysis suggests that , in these regions qso spectra are very similar to each other .",
    "therefore , our decision to combine all the qsos at a given redshift when estimating the shape of the continuum ( i.e. , to treat all qsos at a given redshift as differing in the normalization , but not the shape , of the continuum ) is likely to be reasonable .",
    "figure  [ compz ] shows composite spectra as a function of restframe wavelength for a number of bins in redshift : the curve which is highest on the left is for @xmath90 , the next highest is for @xmath91 , and so on , until the lowest curve which is for @xmath92 .",
    "the bins in @xmath93 over which this averaging was done were chosen to be as small as possible  they were set by the sdss pixel sizes .",
    "there are typically about 100 qsos per bin ( figure  [ fig : nzqso ] shows the exact distribution of qso redshifts in our sample ) .",
    "the vertical lines on the left show three different wavelength regions adopted in defining the ly@xmath0 forest : 10601180    ( dashed ) , 1080 - 1160    ( dot - dot - dot - dashed ) , and 11001150    ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "redward of the ly@xmath0 emission line at @xmath94   , the different curves in figure  [ compz ] are all very similar to each other ( although the emission line and redward may be evolving slightly , and the uppermost curve , corresponding to the qsos in the lowest redshift bin , appears to be slightly different from all the others ; the apparent evolution of the red wing of the line is discussed in more detail by richards et al .",
    "evidently , redward of @xmath84 , the qso population as a whole evolves little between @xmath95 and @xmath22 .",
    "blueward of @xmath84 , however , there is an obvious trend : there is less observed flux in the spectra of higher redshift qsos .",
    "our problem is to turn this trend into a quantitative estimate of how the effective optical depth evolves .",
    "this can be done because the effective optical depth is the same at fixed observed , rather than restframe wavelength , whereas the continuum is a function of restframe wavelength .    to illustrate , consider the bumps at 1070    and 1120   .",
    "because they are present at the same restframe wavelengths in all the redshift bins , they can not have been caused by features in the evolution of the optical depth .",
    "( if we define the ly@xmath0 forest as spanning the range @xmath96   , then for the lowest redshift bin , @xmath90 , the forest spans the range @xmath97 , whereas for the highest redshift bin , @xmath92 , the forest spans @xmath98 .",
    "features at fixed @xmath57 would appear at quite different wavelengths for the different qso redshift bins . )",
    "therefore , the bumps must be intrinsic to the qso spectrum  they could be and in emission .",
    "their presence can affect our estimates of the effective optical depth in the forest .",
    "in low resolution observations such as ours , the continuum level is usually calibrated redwards of the ly@xmath0  emission line and then extrapolated bluewards assuming a smooth power - law shape ( e.g. , press , rybicki & schneider 1993 ) .",
    "however , departures from a smooth power - law , such as the two emission lines at @xmath99    and @xmath100   , are clearly present in our data .",
    "( figure  5 of press , rybicki & schneider 1993 also shows bumps at these wavelengths , although they do not call attention to them . ) in addition , at wavelengths close to the ly@xmath0 or ly@xmath31/ emission features , emission from the qso can contaminate the flux in the forest ",
    "smooth power - law fits to the mean continuum shape can not account for this .",
    "the following section describes how we solve simultaneously for the evolution of the effective optical depth and for the shape of the mean continuum , while allowing for the possibility that neither are well - fit by featureless power - laws .",
    "the observed composite spectrum is the product of the mean continuum times the mean transmission .",
    "this fact suggests defining @xmath101 where the sum is over all pixels in all spectra in the sample which fall in the wavelength range associated with the forest .",
    "the composite spectra suggest that the continuum is the superposition of a power - law , two emission lines and the blueward side of the ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "therefore , we parametrize @xmath102 and we set @xmath103 so as to allow the possibility of a feature centred at @xmath104 superimposed on an otherwise smooth power - law evolution of @xmath33 . to reduce the number of free parameters we have fixed the position of the peak of the ly@xmath0 emission line ( @xmath105   ) and of the other two emission lines seen in the composite spectrum ( @xmath106  and @xmath107   ) .",
    "then the remaining eight parameters of @xmath54 and the five parameters of @xmath6 are varied until @xmath108 has been minimized ( note that @xmath94 is not a parameter ) . in principle , we could have attempted to fit the emission lines redward of @xmath84 ( as was done by press , rybicki & schneider 1993 ) .",
    "since we are more interested in the shape of the continuum blueward of @xmath84 , we did not do this .",
    "the exact parameter values which minimize @xmath108 depend somewhat on the range used to define the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "we have tried three ranges which are shown in figure  [ compz ] : the largest range 10601180    ( shown by the dashed lines ) requires that we understand the continuum even in the regime which is close to the ly@xmath0 emission line , the shorter less demanding range 10801160    ( dashed - dot - dot - dotted lines ) is our standard , and the shortest , most conservative range is 11001150    ( dashed - dotted lines ) .",

    ": we have described two methods which allow one to solve simultaneously for the shape of the qso continuum in the restframe wavelength range between the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath31 emission lines and the evolution of the mean transmission in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the two methods lead to the same conclusion  the inferred continuum is not a featureless power - law but has bumps in it ; these are almost certainly emission lines from the qso .",
    "it is important to account for these features in the continuum when estimating the mean transmission in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "although the effective optical depth increases with increasing redshift , it does not evolve smoothly : there appears to be little or no evolution around @xmath165 .",
    "the next section studies the evidence for this feature in more detail .",
    "this section discusses a number of possible systematic effects which might have given rise to a feature in the mean transmission , but argues that none of these are the cause .",
    "the @xmath108 method solves simultaneously for the mean transmission and the mean continuum .",
    "the technique works best when the sample covers a large range in redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the number of pixels in our sample at each redshift @xmath57 , when the forest is defined by our standard wavelength interval 10801160    ( the middle of the three intervals shown in figure  [ compz ] ) .",
    "each spectrum contains about 120 pixels which fall in the ly@xmath0 forest , and we have on the order of @xmath166 spectra .",
    "therefore , we have a large number of pixels from which to determine the shape of the continuum and the transmission , and the figure shows that they do indeed span a large redshift range .    however , two features in figure  [ fig : hist ] deserve further comment .",
    "first , there are obvious drops at @xmath167 and at @xmath168 .",
    "the sdss pipeline reductions do not completely subtract the sky - line  ( @xmath169   ) .",
    "this wavelength range corresponds to a ly@xmath0 redshift of @xmath167 ; hence the gap in the figure .",
    "therefore , we removed from our analysis the observed wavelength range @xmath170   .",
    "the gap at @xmath168 is due to interstellar ; the pixels affected by this line ( at 5894.6   ) were also removed from our analysis .",
    "second , there is a more gradual and extended dip in counts around @xmath171 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission line passes from the @xmath172 to the @xmath173 band at @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the observed colors of qsos change relatively rapidly in this regime , and so one might worry that the color  based algorithm which sdss uses for targetting qso candidates for observation is less accurate at these redshifts . in particular , one might worry that the dip in counts evident in figure  [ fig : hist ] signals the fact that the selection algorithm chooses a biased subset of the complete population at these redshifts .",
    "this is of particular concern because the feature in @xmath174 occurs in this redshift range .",
    "a detailed discussion of the effect of the color  based selection is presented in appendix  [ seffects ] , which argues that the selection does not result in a biased measurement of the mean transmission .",
    "it also argues that , if there are inaccuracies in how the sdss spectrograph is calibrated , they do not give rise to a feature in the evolution of the mean transmission .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in our sample is low .",
    "we would like to be sure that the evolution of @xmath33 does not depend on @xmath44 .",
    "the panel on the left of figure  [ s / n ] shows the distribution of the typical @xmath44 when the ratio is computed on the red side of @xmath84 in each spectrum .",
    "the panel on the right shows the distribution of typical @xmath44 ratios in the ly@xmath0 forest region of each spectrum for qsos with large ( solid ) and small ( dashed ) @xmath44 ratios redward of @xmath84 .",
    "figure  [ lyasnz ] shows the distribution of @xmath44 ratios in the forest as a function of redshift .",
    "the two panels are for spectra with @xmath139 and @xmath175 redward of the ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "the upper panel shows that the higher redshift spectra tend to have lower @xmath44 ratios .",
    "comparison with the typical noise curves in different panels of figure  [ fig : composite ] suggests that the noise in the ly@xmath0 forest is approximately the same at all redshifts .",
    "if the noise does not change with redshift , then the fact that the mean transmission is smaller at high redshift means that the typical @xmath44 ratios will also be smaller at high redshift .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the trend in figure  [ lyasnz ] .",
    "therefore , figure  [ lyasnz ] suggests that if we keep only spectra with larger values of @xmath44 ( i.e. , we use only those spectra which contribute to the top panel ) , then we will not introduce any severe redshift dependent cuts into the sample .",
    "an estimate of @xmath174 in the higher signal - to - noise sample should therefore be fair .",
    "note that it is important to make this cut using the @xmath44 ratio redward of ly@xmath0 ; if the noise is approximately the same for all spectra , then eliminating spectra with small @xmath44 ratios in the ly@xmath0 forest region biases the sample towards larger transmission .",
    "figure  [ hilosn ] shows the evolution of the effective optical depth estimated using spectra which have low ( stars ) and high ( circles ) signal - to - noise ratios redward of the ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "dashed line ( same as in figure  [ meantau ] ) shows the evolution inferred for the entire sample .",
    "there are many fewer low @xmath44 spectra , so the stars scatter wildly .",
    "in contrast , the feature in @xmath33 is more obvious in the spectra which have s / n@xmath176 ( 796 of the 1061 spectra in our full sample form this higher s / n subsample ) .",
    "the plots which follow show results from the higher @xmath44 subsample only .",
    "the @xmath108 estimate of @xmath33 comes from a sum over the fluxes in each pixel , so it can be thought of as an estimate which smoothes the data as little as possible .",
    "it is interesting to see if the inferred evolution depends on how the measurement is smoothed .",
    "for example , we could have chosen to compute the mean transmission averaged over the spectrum of each qso : i.e. , we could average the transmission over all the ly@xmath0 forest pixels in the spectrum of each object , and plot it as a function of the mean redshift of the forest ( recall that this redshift depends on the redshift of the qso ) . or we could split the ly@xmath0 forest of each spectrum into two pieces , or four pieces , or eight , etc .",
    ", down to the minimum possible scale which is set by the sdss pixel size , and plot the mean transmission as a function of the mean redshift in the half - spectrum , the quarter - spectrum , etc .",
    "there is no compelling reason for prefering one choice to another since , whatever sets the physical scale in the forest ( e.g. , the jeans smoothing scale is expected to be about 30 km s@xmath12 ) , the sdss spectrograph does not resolve it .    figure  [ fig : binsize ] shows the evolution of the effective optical depth in the ly@xmath0 forest as a function of smoothing scale .",
    "the solid curve shows the evolution derived from applying the @xmath108 technique to the sample with higher @xmath44 ( parameters are in table  1 ) ; dashed curves show the same , but have been offset from the solid curve for clarity .",
    "symbols , which have also been offset for clarity , show the mean @xmath33 derived after cutting the spectra in half ( top ) , in quarters ( second from top ) , in eight ( third from top ) , and so on , and plotting versus the median redshift @xmath57 in the half - spectrum , the quarter - spectrum , etc .",
    "the figure shows that evidence for a feature in @xmath33 becomes apparent only when the size over which the measurement is averaged is smaller than the size of the feature .",
    "once the smoothing scale is smaller than @xmath177 , i.e. , about 3,000 km  s@xmath12 , the feature in @xmath33 is robust .",
    "although the evolution of @xmath33 inferred from mean value statistics does not depend on the bin size , the estimated evolution from median value statistics does .",
    "this is a signature that the underlying distribution of flux decrements is non - gaussian .",
    "[ a non - gaussian distribution is not unexpected ; it is seen in hydro - dynamical simulations of the ly@xmath0 forest , and there are theoretical models relating it to the non - gaussian distribution of mildly nonlinear density fluctuations ( e.g. , gaztaaga & croft 1999 ) . ] appendix  [ app : skew ] summarizes the effects of using median rather than mean value statistics to make all our estimates .",
    "it shows that , for the median as for the mean , a feature in @xmath174 appears at @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mbtau4 ] shows that the feature in @xmath33 is not caused by qsos in one particular redshift range , nor does it depend on the precise wavelength range used to define the forest .",
    "the different sets of curves show results for three different choices of the wavelength range spanned by the ly@xmath0 forest : the middle curve and associated symbols show results for the wavelength range @xmath147   ; the upper and lower curves , which have been shifted by @xmath178 for clarity , show results for the wavelength ranges @xmath179    and @xmath96   , respectively .",
    "results for the larger range are more likely to be affected by inaccuracies in our continuum fit which arise from the fact that the ly@xmath0 emission line at @xmath94    has a tail which extends to shorter wavelengths ( cf . figures  [ compz ] and  [ prox ] ) .",
    "the shortest wavelength range is more conservative about the accuracy of the continuum fit in the vicinity of the emission line .    in each set of curves , triangles , squares and diamonds",
    "show @xmath180 estimated from the mean transmission in the pixels of spectra of qsos in the redshift ranges @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 .",
    "the figure shows that the measurements from the three redshift ranges fit smoothly onto each other and overlap ( the amount of overlap depends , of course , on the wavelength range the ly@xmath0 forest spans ) , even though the sdss sample in the middle redshift range is incomplete ( appendix  [ seffects ] ) . also , note that the feature in @xmath33 does not depend on the wavelength range used to define the ly@xmath0 forest ",
    "although the dip is perhaps more obvious in our most conservative definition of the forest ( top curve ) than when the forest overlaps the tails of ly@xmath0 emission line ( bottom ) .",
    "one of the novel features of the continuum we use is the incorporation of non - power - law features ( such as the bumps at @xmath99    and @xmath100   ) .",
    "other studies of @xmath33 using similarly low resolution spectra ( e.g. schneider , schmidt & gunn et al .",
    "1991 ) do not incorporate these features . to compare our results with theirs",
    ", we repeated the analysis assuming that the continuum was a featureless power - law with slope @xmath164 ( see , e.g. , the smooth solid lines in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "filled circles in figure  [ taunorm ] show @xmath174 for our standard definition of the continuum , and crosses show the result of using the featureless power - law .",
    "since the power - law continuum has less flux than our standard , the inferred mean transmission is always higher , so the associated @xmath33 always slightly lower .",
    "retaining features in the continuum , but normalizing by the flux in the range @xmath181     ( the region just blueward of the emission line ) instead of @xmath72    ( diamonds in figure  [ taunorm ] ) , or normalizing by the flux in both regions ( stars in figure  [ taunorm ] ) , makes little difference at high redshifts , but begins to matter at lower redshifts .",
    "a glance at the composite spectra in figure  [ fig : composite ] shows why : a power - law which is normalized to fit the range @xmath72    only provides a good fit to the region in front of at higher redshifts , but systematically underestimates the flux there by a small amount at lower redshifts .",
    "changing the normalization increases the flux in the continuum , which reduces the inferred transmission and increases the effective optical depth .",
    "although the evolution of @xmath33 , particularly at lower redshifts does depend on how we normalize the spectra , the feature in @xmath33 is present , at the same redshift , in all cases .",
    "we have also examined ( and excluded ) the possibility that the feature is produced by intrinsic absorption in a subset of qso in our sample by 1 ) determining that the optical depth is not a function of velocity of the absorber from the emission redshift , and 2 ) determining that the effect is not influenced by the well - known velocity shift of emission ( e.g. richards et al .",
    "when applied to a sample of 1061 qso spectra drawn from the sdss database , two methods  which solve simultaneously for the shape of the qso continuum and for the evolution of the mean transmission  give consistent results .",
    "both methods show that the continuum in the wavelength range between the ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath31 emission lines is not smooth , but has features in it .",
    "the two methods also show that although the effective ly@xmath0 optical depth decreases smoothly with time , @xmath2 , it drops by about 10 percent from @xmath182 to @xmath183 , and it recovers to the original smooth scaling by @xmath4 .",

    "figure  [ taulit ] shows that our measurements are in general agreement with previous work based on low resolution , low signal - to - noise spectra ( compare small filled circles with stars and diamonds ) .",
    "however , because our sample is so much larger than any previously available , it is possible to measure the evolution of @xmath33 in smaller redshift bins than was possible previously .",
    "the figure also shows that our measurement of @xmath33 results in about ten percent less transmitted flux than suggested by recent measurements from higher resolution spectra ( triangles and large circles ) . at higher redshifts ,",

    "this , together with small number statistics may account for some of the discrepancy at @xmath184 . at lower redshifts ,",
    "some of the discrepancy may arise because damped ly@xmath0 systems and/or metal lines , which become increasingly abundant at low redshifts , have been removed from the higher resolution spectra , but are still present and contributing to the effective optical depth in our sample . although the mean transmission measured in noisy and low resolution spectra may yield a biased measure of the slope and amplitude of the evolution of the true effective optical depth ( e.g. , steidel & sargent 1987 ) ,",
    "it is difficult to see why this bias should lead to a _ feature _ in @xmath174 .",

    "if the locations of the ly@xmath0 forest absorption features in the restframe spectrum of one qso are uncorrelated with those in most of the others , then if we average many spectra together , the net effect of the forest absorption is to remove flux from the averaged spectrum .",

    "a simple first estimate is to shift the dashed line upwards until it matches the extrapolated continuum .",
    "this provides an estimated continuum which has the same amplitude as the power - law fit but has bumps in it .",

    "all three curves are significantly different from the featureless power - law .",

    "this appendix studies two systematic effects which might give rise to the feature we see in the evolution of the effective depth , and argues that they do not .",
    "figure  [ fig : nzqso ] shows the observed distribution of qso redshifts in our sample .",
    "there is an obvious drop in numbers around @xmath23 , which , as we describe below , is a consequence of how the colors of quasars change as a function of the sdss bandpasses .",
    "since the feature we see in @xmath174 occurs at slightly lower redshifts ( see figure  [ meantau ] ) , at least some of the signal comes from the ly@xmath0 forests in the spectra of these @xmath23 qsos .",
    "this appendix studies if the feature we see in the optical depth is caused entirely by the qso selection algorithm .",
    "our approach is to simulate a sample of qso spectra in which there is no feature in @xmath174 , select the subset of objects which sdss would have identified as qsos , and measure @xmath174 in the subset .",
    "we then check if the sdss  selected subset shows any feature in @xmath174 .",
    "the algorithm used by the sdss collaboration to target qso candidate objects is described by richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "in essence , it uses a stellar locus outlier rejection algorithm , further supplemented with a combination of cuts in the @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 color - spaces . to test the effects of this selection procedure",
    ", we must generate a set of mock qsos for which redshifts , spectra and colors are known .",
    "to generate such a sample using the observed one ( which is almost certainly incomplete in the range @xmath209 ) we must make some assumptions which we describe below .    to generate redshifts of what we will call the complete sample ,",
    "we draw a straight line in figure  [ fig : nzqso ] from the observed number at @xmath210 , @xmath211 , to the observed number , @xmath212 , at @xmath213 .",
    "we then assume that the @xmath214 distribution of a complete sample would follow @xmath215 over the ranges @xmath161 and @xmath163 , and would follow the smooth straight line we drew for the redshifts in between . note that this means we are assuming that the observed sample is complete at redshifts @xmath163 , and also at @xmath161 .",
    "we then generate a distribution of redshifts which follows this model for the complete @xmath214 distribution .",
    "the sdss qso selection is based on color , so our next step is to assign colors to our mock qsos which are consistent with their redshifts .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "let @xmath216 denote the redshift of a mock qso .",
    "we randomly choose one of the observed qsos with @xmath217 ; we will use it to generate a mock qso spectrum .",
    "the requirement that @xmath217 insures that none of the qsos we use to generate our complete sample is from the regime in which we are most worried that the observed sample is incomplete .",
    "we then blue- or redshift the observed spectrum to the desired redshift @xmath216 .    to be specific ,",
    "suppose that @xmath218 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath219 , the ratio of the flux blueward of ly@xmath0 to that of the continuum at the same wavelength . we know that this ratio evolves with redshift ( see figure  [ meantau ] ) .",
    "we would like to generate a sample of spectra in which @xmath33 evolves smoothly with @xmath5 , and so we require that @xmath33 evolve like a smooth line , e.g. @xmath220 .",
    "let @xmath221 denote the value of this ratio which gives rise to this smooth evolution in @xmath33 . since @xmath33 decreases with @xmath5 , the higher - redshift qso which we have blueshifted to @xmath216 has too little flux in its forest ( too much absorption ) compared to what we want .",
    "we remedy this as follows .",
    "let @xmath222 denote the observed wavelength of a pixel .",
    "it has a ly@xmath0 redshift @xmath223 .",
    "the associated value of the flux decrement is @xmath224 , and this may be different from @xmath225 . upon blueshifting ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 redshift we should associate with the pixel is @xmath226 therefore , after fitting the continuum to the blueshifted spectrum , we add @xmath227\\,f_{\\rm cont}$ ] to the flux in each pixel which lies blueward of the ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "this ensures that the mean value of @xmath228 is consistent with the smooth featureless evolution , but keeps approximately the same statistical fluctuations around the mean that were present at @xmath229 .",
    "thus , we have a spectrum in which @xmath230 , in the mean , follows @xmath221 .",
    "( in practice , we also add gaussian noise with rms  @xmath231 chosen to be slightly smaller than that observed . )    by convolving this spectrum with the sdss filter curves , we could , in principle , generate mock luminosities and hence , mock colors . in practice , there are two reasons why we can not do this quite yet .",
    "first , the sdss spectra cover only a finite range in wavelength . by shifting a higher redshift spectrum blueward to simulate one at lower redshift",
    ", it may be that we have no spectrum left from which to estimate the flux in the reddest band @xmath232 .",
    "to remedy this , we randomly choose a low - redshift qso from among those observed with @xmath233 , shift its spectrum to @xmath216 , correct its flux blueward of ly@xmath0 to the required mean @xmath221 , and add gaussian noise with rms @xmath231 if desired .",
    "although this spectrum can be used to estimate the @xmath232 band flux , it may not cover the full wavelength range spanned by the bluest filter , @xmath234 . by averaging",
    "the two shifted spectra ( normalized as described in section  3 of the main text ) in the range in which they overlap , and by simply using one spectrum in the regime where the other does not extend , we have a final simulated spectrum which spans the full required range in wavelengths .",
    "( in practice , it sometimes happens that we still do not have enough wavelength coverage for the @xmath234 band .",
    "this does not happen often , but when it does , we transform the spectrum of a @xmath235 qso as described above , and we only add that piece of the spectrum which is needed to compute the @xmath234 band flux . )    we can now perform the required convolutions with the five sdss filter response curves , and so generate mock magnitudes for the five different bands . since these magnitudes are estimated from the spectra , we will refer to them as ` spec  magnitudes ' . before computing mock ` spec ",
    "colors ' using these mock spec  magnitudes , we must ` flux  calibrate ' : we must check if the spec  magnitudes of the observed sample do indeed match the measured apparent magnitudes output by the sdss photometric pipeline .",
    "the finite length of the sdss spectra means that we can only compute spec - magnitudes for the @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath236 bands , so this comparison can only be done for these three bands .    the sdss photometric pipeline outputs a variety of different measures of magnitude , two of which are useful for our purposes .",
    "the first is the psf ",
    "magnitude , which is appropriate for point sources ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for details ) , and is the one used by the collaboration to define the colors which are used to determine whether or not an object is a qso candidate . the second , the fiber ",
    "magnitude , is an estimate of the light in a 3 arcsec aperture . since",
    "the spectra are taken with fibers of this size , spec  magnitudes are perhaps best compared with fiber  magnitudes .",
    "a comparison of the spec and fiber  magnitudes of the objects in our sample shows a linear relation with rms scatter around the mean of 0.14  mags .",
    "however , although a comparison of the psf and fiber  magnitudes of the objects shows the expected linear relation , there is a mean offset of 0.2  mags ( the rms scatter around the mean is 0.07  mags ) .",
    "this offset is approximately the same in all three bands .",
    "the spec versus psf ",
    "magnitude comparison also shows a mean offset : @xmath237  mags .",
    "figure  [ smags ] shows the difference between the spec  magnitudes measured from the spectra and the psf  magnitudes output by the sdss photometric pipeline in the three bands , after this offset has been removed .",
    "the plots show that the difference between the two does not correlate with psf  magnitude , and that the scatter between the two is @xmath238  mags .",
    "this shows that by subtracting 0.2  mags from the spec ",
    "magnitude one gets a reasonable estimate of the psf  magnitude .",
    "thus , we can use the spec  magnitudes to compute spec ",
    "colors which are analogous to the psf  colors . since we can compute spec ",
    "colors from our simulated spectra , this allows us to compute mock @xmath239 and @xmath240 colors with which to model the effects of the sdss selection algorithm .",
    "the sdss qso selection algorithm also makes use of the @xmath234 and @xmath232 band light .",
    "we can not compute spec - magnitudes in these bands from the observed spectra , but we can compare the psf and fiber  magnitudes in these bands .",
    "they show the same offset as in the other three bands .",
    "so , although we can not test if the spec and fiber  magnitudes are the same in these bands , it is likely that the spec and psf  magnitudes differ similarly to how the did in the other band . in principle , then , we could use the same procedure as for the other bands to convert from spec  magnitudes to mock @xmath234 and @xmath232 band psf ",
    "magnitudes , and hence to mock psf  colors .    in practice",
    ", we have taken a different approach .",
    "namely , a plot of the observed @xmath241 psf  color versus the simulated @xmath242 spec  color shows a linear relation ( with small scatter ) , but with an offset which we attribute to offset@xmath243 ( recall that we had previously calibrated and applied an offset to @xmath244 ) .",
    "an estimate of offset@xmath245 is obtained analogously .",
    "thus , we now have a mock qso catalog with redshifts , luminosities in five bands , and hence colors .",
    "the different panels in figure  [ scolors ] show the distribution of observed ( left ) and simulated ( right ) colors in different redshift bins .",
    "the dashed lines show some of the sdss selection cuts ( the total set of selection criteria is described in richards et al .",
    "2002a ) . in the panels which show the simulated colors ,",
    "fainter symbols show objects which would have been targetted for observation by the sdss collaboration , and darker symbols show objects which the collaboration would not have observed .    on the whole ,",
    "the simulated and observed samples are rather similar , although there are significant differences around @xmath246 , and smaller differences at @xmath247 . to quantify this , figure  [ fig : nzsim ]",
    "compares the @xmath214 distribution of the simulated complete sample ( solid line ) with the distribution of the subsample selected following the sdss selected procedure ( dashed line ) .",
    "notice how the simulated sdss ",
    "subsample is missing objects in the range @xmath246 .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig : nzqso ] shows that the resulting mock @xmath214 distribution is rather similar to that seen in the data , suggesting that our mock catalogs are a reasonable model of the selection effect .",
    "our concern is that this selection effect may be responsible for the feature we see in @xmath174 ( figure  [ meantau ] ) . to address this ,",
    "figure  [ tausim ] compares @xmath174 in the simulated complete sample with @xmath174 in the sdss  selected subsample .",
    "the figure shows that the evolution of @xmath33 in both cases is very similar , even in the regime in which the sdss  selected subsample contains many fewer objects than the complete sample .",
    "this suggests that the qso selection does not give rise to the feature we see in figure  [ meantau ] .",
    "the feature in the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath3 occurs in the observed wavelength range @xmath248   .",
    "our measurement makes strong demands on how well the sdss spectrograph is calibrated . the rest wavelength range @xmath249    immediately blueward of the emission line of most qso spectra is relatively flat  indeed , as described in the main text , it is from within this region that we normalize the flux in each spectrum .",
    "we used this region to test whether inaccuracies in the spectrograph could have caused the feature we detected as follows .    since the wavelength region blueward of the  emission line lies @xmath250    redward of the ly@xmath0 forest , to cover the same observed wavelength range it was necessary to use a sample of qsos at lower redshift than the sample used in this paper .",
    "therefore , we extracted from the sdss database 600 qsos in the redshift interval @xmath251 ( excluding bals and/or low quality spectra ) .",
    "we normalized each spectrum by the flux in the rest wavelength range @xmath181  (the region blueward of ) .",
    "we then fit a continuum as described in the main text , and measured the mean transmission relative to this continuum in the wavelength range @xmath252   , what we will call the  forest .",
    "figure  [ fig : tauciv ] compares the mean transmission versus observed wavelength in the ly@xmath0 forest ( stars ) and the  forest ( triangles ) .",
    "notice that there is no feature in the  forest .",
    "this indicates that calibration problems are not responsible for the feature we see in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "we stated in the main text that flux calibration problems near the blue end of the spectrograph limit the redshift range over which we can study the ly@xmath0 forest . to illustrate the problem , we first selected 1000 qsos at @xmath253 .",
    "we then calibrated each spectrum as follows .",
    "since is at the blue end of the spectrum for the lower redshift qsos , the region blueward of ( the restframe wavelength @xmath181   ) is not measured , and so it can not be used to calibrate . the vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2001 ) composite spectrum shows that the closest region redward of which is not contaminated by emission lines is far away  at about 5000    in the restrame ! on the other hand , although the region just redward of is contaminated by emission , it is relatively featureless , and it does not appear to change very much in the redshift range @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , we used this region to calibrate the low redshift spectra , and we then measured the mean transmission in the forest .",
    "figure  [ civcalib ] shows that the mean transmission is relatively constant redward of @xmath254   ; it is less than unity because the region just redward of contains more flux than the region just blueward of ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : composite ] ) .",
    "however , the transmitted flux decreases by slightly more than ten percent between 4400    and 4000   .",
    "a drop of slightly more than ten percent is also seen in the ly@xmath0 forest at these same wavelengths .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the ly@xmath0 optical depth at @xmath255 should be correlated with the optical depth at @xmath256 , so the occurence of the feature almost certainly reflects a problem with the spectroscopic calibrations .",
    "in the main text we showed that our estimate of the mean transmission did not depend strongly on the length of the segments over which the measurement was averaged , provided this length was small .",
    "although the bin size is not important for mean statistics , the bin size does matter for median statistics .",
    "the solid curves in figure  [ fig : mbtaumedian ] show the evolution of @xmath33 computed using @xmath257 , the mean value of @xmath27 , as the bin size is increased from 150  kms@xmath12 ( bottom ) , to 300  kms@xmath12 , 450  kms@xmath12 , 600  kms@xmath12 , and 750  kms@xmath12 ( top ) .",
    "the curves are indistinguishable from each other , illustrating that our results do not depend on the size of the bin .",
    "the dotted lines show the same , but for the evolution of @xmath33 computed using the median value of @xmath27 rather than the mean .",
    "the figure shows that , in this case , the bin size does matter  the estimate from the median becomes increasingly similar to that from the mean as the bin size increases .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath33 does show a feature at @xmath3 , whatever the smoothing scale .    that the median optical depth is smaller than the mean is a consequence of the well known fact that the distribution of flux decrements is skewed .",
    "smoothing makes the fluxes in different pixels similar , so the median and mean values become increasingly alike as the smoothing scale is increased .",
