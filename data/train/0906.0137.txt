    "we introduce in this paper a new method to understand the complexity of word problems in certain groups .",
    "this problem , and the closely associated problem of finding a dehn function for a group , have been a focus of study in combinatorial group theory .",
    "we then apply our method to obtain new information about the complexity of certain words in the braid group .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is a word in a finitely presented group @xmath7 which represents the identity element and is a product of @xmath8 generators .",
    "then there is a sequence of @xmath9 relators that can be applied to @xmath6 to produce the empty word .",
    "a dehn function gives an upper bound for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath8 , and there has been extensive study of these functions @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "while the dehn function indicates the worst case for words of length @xmath8 , it does nt give information about particular words .",
    "we present in this paper a technique which , in certain cases , allows the counting of the number of relations that need to be applied to transform a particular word @xmath6 to the empty word .",
    "an invariant is assigned to a word and the effect of a relator on the invariant is determined .",
    "the invariant can then give lower bounds on the number of relators needed to connect two words .",
    "we apply this to study certain words in the braid group .",
    "the braid group on four or more strands has a noncyclic free abelian subgroup , so its dehn function is at least quadratic .",
    "the abelian subgroups arise from crossings between pairs of non - adjacent strands , which lead to commutativity relations .",
    "we show that the braid groups have non - linear dehn function for deeper reasons .",
    "the number of relations required to trivialize certain words is quadratic even without counting the commutativity relations .    to get these results we consider certain invariants assigned to words in the braid group .",
    "these invariants are obtained from invariants of knot diagrams that were introduced in @xcite .",
    "we compute how these invariants change when a relator in the braid group is applied to a word , showing that they are unchanged by the commutativity relations and by the canceling of a generator with its inverse , and change by @xmath10 under the other relations .",
    "we then produce a sequence of words @xmath11 which represent the identity element and for which the invariant is quadratic with respect to the length of @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that at least a quadratic number of relations are needed to trivialize @xmath5 , even with commutativity relations not counted .",
    "we note that thurston showed that braid groups are automatic , and that the the word problem in @xmath3 is solvable in @xmath12 steps @xcite .",
    "therefore there exists also a quadratic upper bound for these words .",
    "it is known that the braid group @xmath3 on @xmath0 strands has the following presentation : @xmath13 where we take @xmath14 to be a positive crossing between the @xmath15th and @xmath16th strand , as appears in figure f1 .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two words in the generators @xmath2 representing the same element in @xmath3 , then there is a finite sequence of modifications that brings us from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , where each modification is of one of the following three types :    1 .",
    "a subword of the form @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath20 or vice versa .",
    "a subword of the form @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "a subword of the form @xmath24 or @xmath25 is replaced by the empty word , or vice versa .",
    "we will be interested in counting the number of modifications of type ( 1 ) required to pass from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "so , we define :    [ d ] given words @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the generators @xmath2 of @xmath3 , representing the same element in @xmath3 , we define the distance @xmath26 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , to be the minimal number of modifications of type ( 1 ) that may appear in a sequence of modifications passing from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "we note that we could have included as basic modifications also those interchanging between @xmath27 and @xmath28 and between @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath23 . but",
    "this would not have changed the definition of @xmath26 , since each such modification can be achieved by a sequence of modifications which includes precisely one modification of the same type with positive exponents , and all other modifications of type ( 3 ) .    for @xmath31",
    "there is a natural embedding @xmath32 given by adding @xmath33 straight strands to the given braid . in terms of the generators",
    "this is given simply by @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we now show that the distance @xmath26 is preserved under this embedding .",
    "[ emb ] let @xmath36 be two words in @xmath2 representing the same element in @xmath3 .",
    "then the distance @xmath26 is the same whether @xmath36 are interpreted in @xmath3 , or in @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "denote by @xmath39 the distances in @xmath40 respectively .",
    "any sequence of modifications in @xmath3 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 defines the same sequence in @xmath37 , so @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "given a sequence in @xmath37 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , look at the braid diagram of each word in @xmath37 along the way , and delete from it its @xmath33 last strands .",
    "this produces a sequence in @xmath3 from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "some of the modifications in @xmath37 induce the corresponding modifications in @xmath3 , whereas others induce no modification at all .",
    "we get @xmath42 , so together @xmath43 .    in this work",
    "we prove the following :    [ main ] for any @xmath0 there exists a sequence of words @xmath1 in the generators @xmath2 of @xmath3 , representing the identity element of @xmath3 , such that the length of the word @xmath5 is @xmath44 , and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the empty word .",
    "( that is , the minimal number of modifications of the form @xmath4 required to pass from @xmath5 to @xmath46 is @xmath47 . )",
    "by lemma emb it is enough to prove theorem main for @xmath48",
    ". we will prove it as follows . for any word @xmath6 in @xmath48 representing the identity element",
    ", we define the knot diagram @xmath49 to be the closure of the braid diagram @xmath50 .",
    "( the purpose of adding @xmath51 is that a knot will be obtained , rather than a three component link . )",
    "our braid modifications on @xmath6 induce reidemeister moves on the knot diagram @xmath49 . we distinguish four types of reidemeister moves , ri , matched rii , unmatched rii , and riii , as appears in figure f2 .",
    "we will use the invariant of knot diagrams introduced in hn to analyze our braid modifications via the reidemeister moves that they induce .",
    "we first recall the definition of the invariant of hn .",
    "we denote the set of all knot diagrams by @xmath52 and the set of all two component links in @xmath53 by @xmath54 .",
    "given a knot diagram @xmath55 and a crossing @xmath17 in @xmath56 , define @xmath57 to be the two component link obtained by smoothing the crossing @xmath17 .",
    "given a knot diagram @xmath56 , let @xmath58 denote the set of all positive crossings in @xmath56 and @xmath59 the set of all negative crossings .",
    "given an invariant of two component links @xmath60 where @xmath61 is any set , let @xmath62 be the free abelian group with basis @xmath63 .",
    "we then define the invariant @xmath64 to be @xmath65    in the present work we take @xmath66 to be the linking number , @xmath67 , giving the invariant @xmath68 . in hn",
    "it is shown that the change in the value of @xmath69 resulting from the various types of reidemeister moves is as follows :      our modification of braid words of type ( 1 ) produces a reidemeister move of type riii , our modification of type ( 2 ) produces no change in the knot diagram , and our modification of type ( 3 ) produces a matched rii move .",
    "let @xmath76 be the homomorphism given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "we now define an invariant @xmath7 of braid words representing the identity element in @xmath48 , as follows : @xmath82 .",
    "it follows from the observations of the previous paragraph that @xmath83 changes by @xmath10 whenever a modification of type 1 takes place , and remains unchanged whenever a modification of type 2 or 3 takes place .",
    "it follows that for any two words @xmath36 representing the identity element in @xmath48 , @xmath84 .",
    "we now construct our sequence of words @xmath5 , together with a second sequence of words @xmath85 .",
    "we will show that @xmath86 , and it will be evident that @xmath87 . since @xmath88 is a pseudometric it follows that @xmath89 .",
    "we construct our two words @xmath90 in the generators @xmath91 of @xmath48 as follows .",
    "our building blocks will be the two words @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and we define @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "note that the length of @xmath5 and @xmath85 in terms of the generators @xmath91 is @xmath44 .",
    "the knot diagrams @xmath96 and @xmath97 are depicted in figure f3 .",
    "( recall that by definition they are the closures of the braid diagrams @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively . ) from the figure , it is clear that the portion @xmath100 in @xmath5 can slide through the portion @xmath101 to obtain @xmath85 .",
    "so indeed @xmath5 and @xmath85 both represent the identity element in @xmath48 .",
    "this sliding process requires precisely @xmath47 applications of the relation @xmath102 and so @xmath103 .    as explained above , a lower bound for @xmath104",
    "may be obtained by computing @xmath105 . for this purpose",
    "we first compute @xmath106 and then apply @xmath107 to this element of @xmath108 .",
    "we note that whenever we smooth a given crossing in the initial portion @xmath109 of @xmath96 , or in its concluding portion @xmath110 , then the link obtained is isotopic to that obtained from @xmath97 by the corresponding smoothing , this isotopy being given by sliding the @xmath100 portion through the @xmath101 portion .",
    "furthermore , any smoothing in the @xmath100 portion also gives isotopic links for @xmath96 and @xmath97 since after such a smoothing this portion may still be slid through the @xmath101 portion .",
    "each such crossing whose smoothing produces isotopic links for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , contributes the same term to @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which cancels in the difference @xmath106 .",
    "so to compute @xmath106 we must only consider crossings in the @xmath101 portion .",
    "two such representative smoothings for @xmath96 are depicted in figure f4 , and the corresponding two smoothings for @xmath97 are depicted in figure f5 .",
    "each @xmath113 in the @xmath101 portion has four crossings .",
    "the top of figure f4 demonstrates the smoothing of the first crossing in , say , the @xmath15th @xmath113 .",
    "one may see from the figure that the linking number of the link obtained is @xmath114 .",
    "since the crossing itself is positive , this contributes @xmath115 to @xmath111 .",
    "the bottom of figure f4 demonstrates the smoothing of the second crossing of the same @xmath113 .",
    "one may see that the linking number here is @xmath116 , and so this crossing , being itself positive , contributes @xmath117 .",
    "the third crossing produces a knot diagram identical to that of the second crossing , so also contributes @xmath117 .",
    "the fourth crossing produces a knot diagram resembling that of the first crossing , but with two additional positive crossing between the two components of the link , and so its linking number is @xmath118 .",
    "( in fact , for @xmath119 , the smoothing of the fourth crossing of the @xmath15th @xmath113 produces an identical knot diagram to that of the first crossing of the @xmath16th @xmath113 . )",
    "so , the fourth crossing contributes @xmath120 .",
    "similar smoothings for @xmath97 appear in figure f5 .",
    "one may verify that the contribution of the four crossings of the @xmath15th @xmath113 are in this case @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "summing over @xmath15 gives : @xmath124 applying @xmath107 we obtain @xmath125 , which proves our lower bound , and so @xmath86 .",
    "as explained above , since clearly @xmath87 , it follows that also @xmath126 .",
