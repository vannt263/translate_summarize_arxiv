    "@xcite evaluated the optimal performance ( minimum error probability ) of a binary quantum system , both with pure and mixed states .",
    "till now , this result represents the only explicit solution of quantum optimization .",
    "in fact , for multilevel quantum systems the optimal solution is known in very few particular cases .",
    "the formulation of helstrom s theory is the following . let be @xmath0 and @xmath1 the density operators of the given binary quantum system and let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the corresponding prior probabilities . then , form the _ decision operator _ as @xmath4 and consider its eigendecompositon ( eid ) , which has the general form @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the eigenvalues and @xmath7 the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "finally , the correct detection probability is given by @xmath8 and the optimal measurement operators by @xmath9 however , the explicit evaluation poses severe difficulties when the dimensions of the underlying hilbert space is larger than two @xcite .    here , we reconsider helstrom s theory presenting a method based on a `` modified '' version of the gram matrix , which we call _ skew gram matrix_. the net difference is that , while the operator @xmath10 is expressed in terms of _ outer products _ ( see ( [ eq : dd6 ] ) ) and has the dimension of the hilbert space , the gram matrix is defined in terms of _ inner products_. the advantage of the replacement of outer products by inner product is a considerable dimensionality reduction . at the limit , in quantum optical communications",
    "the density operators have infinite dimensions , as stated by glauber s theory on the representation of quantum laser radiation field @xcite , whereas the inner products are simply scalar quantities .",
    "this new approach allows to find explicit results for the optimal detection , not only for the case of pure states ( rank 1 density operators ) , as found in @xcite , but also with mixed states .",
    "the explicit results are particularly simple when the quantum states have the _ geometrical uniform symmetry _ ( gus ) .",
    "let @xmath11 and assume that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dimension of the underlying hilbert space .",
