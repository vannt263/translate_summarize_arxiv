    "high - energy nuclear collisions offer the unique opportunity to probe highly excited nuclear matter in the laboratory . at sufficiently high temperature and/or energy density hadrons dissolve and quarks and gluons carrying color charge become the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "this state of matter is commonly called a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "an essential difference between collisions of leptons or hadrons on the one hand and heavy nuclei on the other hand is the development of collectivity in the latter .",
    "collective flow of hadrons , especially the strange hadrons @xmath3 and @xmath4 , has been experimentally observed at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite suggesting that collectivity significantly develops in the early partonic stage , i.e. among quarks and gluons .",
    "presently , the degree of thermalization among partons remains a key issue .",
    "heavy - quark hadrons and their observables are of particular interest when addressing thermalization  @xcite . in a qgp , chiral symmetry might be partially restored and in that case quark masses should approach the current quark masses .",
    "while these are small compared to the temperature @xmath5 for up and down quark and comparable to @xmath5 for the strange quark , they are large compared to @xmath5 for the heavy quarks ( charm and beauty )  @xcite",
    ". therefore heavy quarks are mostly created in the early stage of the collision .",
    "further , annihilation of heavy quarks in the qcd - medium is negligible  @xcite .",
    "thus , heavy quarks probe the entire history of a high - energy nuclear collision .",
    "heavy quarks participate in collective motion provided interactions at the partonic level occur frequently . in general",
    ", frequent interactions drive a system towards local thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , collective motion of heavy - quark hadrons is a powerful tool when addressing early thermalization of quarks and gluons in high  energy nuclear collisions .    in strong interactions",
    "heavy quarks are always created together with their anti ",
    "quark and are thus correlated . in collisions of leptons",
    "it has been shown that a hadron containing a charm or beauty quark carries a significant fraction of the initial quark momentum  @xcite .",
    "hence , the initial heavy - quark correlations survive the fragmentation process into hadrons to a large extent and are observable e.g. in the angular distributions of pairs of @xmath6 and @xmath7mesons  @xcite",
    ".    in high  energy collisions of heavy nuclei , frequent interactions among partons ( quarks and gluons ) of the medium and heavy quarks may lead to a significant modification of these initially existing correlations . on the other hand , hadronic interactions at the late stage are insufficient to alter azimuthal correlations of @xmath8pairs  @xcite .",
    "frequent interactions distribute and randomize the available ( kinetic ) energy and finally drive the system , i.e. light quarks and gluons , to local thermal equilibrium . to what extent",
    "this also happens for heavy quarks is currently a subject of discussion  @xcite .",
    "an experimental tool to address this question is studied in the current publication . a decrease in the strength of heavy quark correlations in high  energy collisions of heavy nuclei",
    "as compared to collisions would indicate early thermalization also of heavy quarks .",
    "we have employed the monte carlo event generator pythia @xcite which implements a fragmentation scheme model that reproduces experimentally observed correlations of @xmath6mesons at fixed target energies  @xcite . to extend calculations in pythia beyond leading order , processes contributing at higher orders",
    "were calculated using a massless matrix element  @xcite applying a lower cut - off in the transverse momentum - transfer scale of the underlying hard scattering to avoid divergences in the calculated cross section  @xcite .",
    "the pythia parameters were subsequently tuned to reproduce these next - to - leading order predictions  @xcite . for the hadronization of charm and bottom",
    "quarks the lund fragmentation scheme was used  @xcite .",
    "our calculations at leading order ( lo ) contain flavor creation processes ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) and lead to an enhancement at relative azimuth around @xmath11 , i.e. the @xmath6meson pair is preferentially emitted back - to - back . here ,",
    "lower - case letters denote light quarks ( @xmath12 ) and gluons ( @xmath13 ) while upper - case letters denote heavy quarks and anti - quarks ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions such as flavor excitation ( @xmath15 ) and gluon splitting ( @xmath16 ) have a strong dependence on the center - of - mass energy and become dominant at lhc .",
    "it was noted in  @xcite that these higher - order processes do not show pronounced features in azimuth and weaken or destroy the azimuthal correlation between charmed hadrons . by choosing momentum cuts ,",
    "a somewhat enhanced correlation was extracted  @xcite .    with these processes",
    "expected to dominate at lhc energies , sensitivity to heavy quark thermalization might be lost .",
    "we investigate whether the @xmath17 correlator as a more sensitive measure of correlations would again provide sensitivity to thermalization .",
    "we introduce the two - particle transverse momentum correlator as a sensitive measure of heavy - quark correlations .",
    "this method has the following advantages : ( i ) the correlator is sensitive to non - statistical fluctuations , thus carving out any physical correlation.(ii ) in case of physically uncorrelated candidate  pairs ( e.g. background ) , the extracted value for the correlator vanishes , thus providing a reliable baseline.(iii ) a localization of the observed correlations in transverse momentum space may help to obtain further insight into the origin of the observed correlations in relative azimuth .",
    "we studied two - particle correlations of @xmath8pairs in the @xmath18-plane , with the cumulative variable @xmath19 defined as @xcite : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the inclusive @xmath17 distribution , normalized to unity , which is obtained from all @xmath8pairs used in the analysis . for the study of two - particle @xmath17 correlations ,",
