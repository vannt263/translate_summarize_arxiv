    "many works deal with the problem of integrability of ordinary differential equations . although the concept of `` integrability '' is delicate , at least four `` routes '' contribute to explore it .",
    "the first one consists of expressing the general solution of an ordinary differential equation in terms of `` known '' functions ; the second deals with the painlev analysis of the equation s singularities ; the third uses the lie symmetry method and the last one is characterized by the existence of invariants , called first integrals when the independent variable does not explicitly appear .",
    "usually a @xmath0 order _ autonomous _ ordinary differential equation is said to be `` integrable '' if it possesses @xmath1 functionally independent first integrals . in this paper",
    "we consider the class of ordinary differential equations invariant under time translation  ( @xmath2 ) and rescaling ( @xmath3 ) , which frequently occur in the modelling of natural phenomena .",
    "we write the generators as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the independent variable and @xmath6 the dependent variable .",
    "the symmetries @xmath2 and  @xmath3 constitute a representation of lie s type iii two - dimensional algebra  @xcite .",
    "the general form of the second order ordinary differential equation invariant under the action of the two symmetries @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent respectively @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we also treat the class of third order equations possessing the three symmetries associated with the generators @xmath12 the second and third of these , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are called homogeneity symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the general form of a third order ordinary differential equation possessing the symmetries  ( [ geronimi : e3 ] )  is @xmath15 in ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) @xmath16 is an arbitrary function of its argument and @xmath17 is the second order differential invariant common to @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . equation ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) is representative of the class of third order ordinary differential equations invariant under the three - dimensional algebra with the single nonzero lie bracket , @xmath18 = g_1 $ ] , denoted by @xmath19 in the mubarakzyanov classification scheme @xcite .",
    "we note that the two - dimensional algebra @xmath20 is of lie s type iv since now @xmath21 .",
    "we also note that ( [ geronimi : e2 ] ) is naturally connected to ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) by the riccati transformation @xmath22 .",
    "this paper has two practical goals , _ viz _ firstly to obtain explicit expressions for the first integrals needed to declare ( [ geronimi : e2 ] ) and ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) integrable and secondly to use these first integrals to push the analytic computations as far as possible in order to obtain parametric solutions taking the form of quadratures which can be performed in closed form when the functions @xmath23 ( in ( [ geronimi : e2 ] ) ) and @xmath24 ( in ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) ) are polynomials .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in the second section",
    "we treat the case of the second order ordinary differential equation ( [ geronimi : e2 ] ) . in the third section",
    "we show how to obtain many first integrals ( with of course only two independent ) for the third order ordinary differential equation ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) and how from these first integrals we deduce the parametric form of the global solution . for functions",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath16 polynomials of at most third degree we present an explicit solution of the time parametrisation quadrature . in the fourth section we present our conclusions .",
    "the important result is the following reduced form of ( [ geronimi : e2 ] ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 8) ) @xmath26 which provides the first integral of ( [ geronimi : e2 ] ) .",
    "we write @xmath27 and consequently @xmath28 \\label{geronimi : s2}\\ ] ] in ( [ geronimi : s2 ] ) the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 refer to the values of @xmath6 and @xmath31 at time @xmath32 which can always be taken as initial time because of the symmetry @xmath2 .",
    "the parametric solution of @xmath9 which is needed to compute the time scale with @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "taking ( [ geronimi : s2 ] ) into account @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{geronimi : s3}\\ ] ] for polynomial @xmath23 the integrations in ( [ geronimi : s2 ] ) and ( [ geronimi : s3 ] ) can be performed in closed form and for polynomials of degree two the integral giving @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "it was shown ( * ? ? ? * equation ( 6 ) ) that a third order ordinary differential equation invariant under time translation and rescaling symmetries can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary function of its arguments .",
    "the connection between the two forms as given by ( [ geronimi : e12 ] ) and ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) ( i.e. the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath16 ) is easy to establish .",
    "firstly the argument @xmath17 is equal to @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "the identification of the two terms in front of @xmath25 and @xmath16 gives @xmath40 moreover it was shown ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 89 ) ) that by applying the two symmetries @xmath2 and @xmath3 to ( [ geronimi : e12 ] ) we obtain @xmath41 we introduce ( [ geronimi : e13 ] ) in ( [ geronimi : e14 ] ) , change the variable @xmath31 to @xmath42 and reformulate ( [ geronimi : e14 ] ) with @xmath43 and @xmath17 to obtain separation of variables and the following first integral @xmath44 consequently we can replace ( [ geronimi : e4 ] ) by ( [ geronimi : e15 ] ) where now @xmath39 can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "now @xmath39 being chosen arbitrarily we obtain as many first integrals as we want , but , of course , only two will be independent .",
    "for polynomial @xmath24 , @xmath39 can be chosen to exhibit the simplest possible form for these first integrals . in order to illustrate our procedure we consider two polynomial functions @xmath24 .",
    "taking first a quadratic polynomial we write @xmath45 ( the case @xmath46 is similar ) .",
    "now we take in ( [ geronimi : e15 ] ) @xmath47 .",
    "introducing ( [ geronimi : e16 ] ) in ( [ geronimi : e15 ] ) we obtain after a simple integration the first integral @xmath48 to find a second simple first integral , we take @xmath49 and obtain @xmath50 so far we have obtained two rather simple first integrals and the ordinary differential equation is now integrable .",
    "moreover the time parametrisation of the trajectory is obtained by the elimination of @xmath17 between @xmath51 ( [ geronimi : e17 ] ) and @xmath52 ( [ geronimi : e18 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath53 and implies the time parametrisation quadrature @xmath54 not surprisingly the performance of the quadrature in ( [ geronimi : q1 ] ) is generally not possible in closed form .",
    "we turn now to an @xmath24 which is a third degree polynomial in @xmath17 .",
    "we write @xmath55 ( if at least two roots @xmath56 are equal , the problem is quite similar ) .",
    "taking respectively @xmath57 , @xmath58 , in ( [ geronimi : e15 ] ) and after a direct integration we find the first integrals @xmath59 the relation @xmath60 proves that the three first integrals are not independent .",
    "thus any pair of ( [ geronimi : ep2 ] ) provides the two independent first integrals needed to declare the ordinary differential equation integrable .",
    "we return now to the general problem . from ( [ geronimi : e15 ] ) writing @xmath61 , @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63,\\qquad i=1,2,\\label{geronimi:333}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 .",
    "firstly we eliminate @xmath9 between the two equations ( [ geronimi:333 ] ) to give @xmath65\\ ] ] and consequently @xmath66 .",
    "\\label{geronimi : b1}\\ ] ] then we eliminate @xmath6 to obtain @xmath9 @xmath67 \\label{geronimi : b2}\\ ] ] relations ( [ geronimi : b1 ] ) and ( [ geronimi : b2 ] ) give the parametric solution ( with @xmath68 ) .",
    "although ( [ geronimi : b1 ] ) and ( [ geronimi : b2 ] ) can be obtained directly ( computing @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) the rather simple expression for the two first integrals is obtained by selecting @xmath71 , @xmath62 , in ( [ geronimi : e15 ] ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 being two roots of @xmath74 .",
    "finally we observe that the computation of the leading order term in the painlev analysis with a singularity in @xmath75 gives the equation @xmath76 if we write @xmath77 , this last equation becomes @xmath78 this confirms the asymptotic character of some of these singular solutions since we recover the divergence of @xmath6 in ( [ geronimi : b1 ] ) for exactly the same value @xmath79 when @xmath80 .",
    "this work deals with the possibility of exhibiting explicit first integrals and parametric solutions for second and third order ordinary differential equations possessing the necessary number of symmetries to be formally integrable .",
    "quite naturally the parameters allowing these simple parametric solutions are the two differential invariants of the equation , namely  @xmath31 for the second order equation and @xmath17 for the third order equation . for functions",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 polynomial the integrals giving @xmath6 and @xmath9 can be performed in closed form and for quadratic @xmath23 the integral giving @xmath5 is obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions . finally for pathological functions @xmath25 and @xmath16 our method minimises numerical calculations .",
    "moreover for the third order equation the main point is indeed the identity with the two homogeneity symmetries and rescaling with an arbitrary parameter @xmath39 which makes our method systematic . for the obtention of first integrals ,",
    "another aspect of these results is that they are at the same time connected and complementary to the painlev analysis .",
