    "heavy - fermion compounds belong to a class of materials which exhibit many intriguing and anomalous phenomena as , for example , the kondo effect . in these materials",
    "the @xmath3 shell electrons present an unstable character that oscillates between localized and itinerant . because of this ambiguous behaviour",
    "they can be found in a broad variety of states including metallic , superconducting , insulating and magnetic states  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been showed that most of the properties of these systems can be attributed to their proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite , and due to this important characteristic , the study of these system at low temperatures has been of great interest recently ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a standard hamiltonian which has been largely used to describe the physical properties of these compounds is the kondo lattice model @xcite .",
    "it assumes the presence of one localized impurity spin on each site of the lattice , coupled to the conduction electrons of the metal .",
    "the interaction between the magnetic moments of the @xmath3 electrons of the impurities and those of the conduction electrons , @xmath4 , is responsible for the kondo effect .",
    "this kondo interaction tends to compensate the local moments , forming singlets , giving rise to a non magnetic ground state . at the same time , because of the large concentration of impurities , it appears an interaction between their magnetic moments .",
    "this is an inter - site coupling of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type and it is mediated by the conduction electrons .",
    "the rkky interaction tends to establish a long range magnetic order in the system , in general , an antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this competition induces a magnetic quantum phase transition in this model which is the actual case in most heavy fermions materials .",
    "a simplified version of the kondo lattice hamiltonian was introduced by doniach in ref .",
    "this model , called kondo necklace ( kn ) , replaces , into the kondo interaction , the spins of the conduction electrons by a set of pseudo - spins on a linear lattice , the charge degrees of freedom being frozen out . in spite of this approximation , the interplay between the kondo mechanism and magnetic ordering remains as an essential feature .",
    "although the kn model has been extensively studied over the last decades many questions about the phase diagram and magnetic properties of intricate versions of this model still remain open and we believe it will still be necessary some effort to be completely understood .    among the recently studied systems is the one - dimensional kn model in the presence of an ising - like anisotropy .",
    "the general hamiltonian that describes the system is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are spin-1/2 pauli matrices denoting the spin of the conduction electrons and those of the local moments , respectively .",
    "@xmath4 is the intra - site exchange interaction between them .",
    "the indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote nearest neighbors on a chain of n sites and @xmath11 is an antiferromagnetic coupling which represents the hopping of the conduction electrons between neighborings sites ( see in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] a schematic representation of the chain with @xmath12 sites , i.e , @xmath13 spins ) .",
    "the ising like anisotropy parameter ( @xmath14 ) varies from zero to one .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram of this model in the ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) plane , with @xmath16 , has been studied by different methods as renormalization group  @xcite , lanczos  @xcite , and dmrg  @xcite .",
    "the main results found in the literature can be summarized as follows .",
    "the line @xmath17 corresponds to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) , purely anisotropic xy model which is ordered at @xmath18  @xcite . for @xmath19 and @xmath20 case , the original kn model is recovered and it is already well established that any finite value of the interaction @xmath4 give rise to a non - magnetic kondo state  @xcite . in the full anisotropic case ( @xmath21 ) , there is an unstable fixed point separating an antiferromagnetic phase for small values of @xmath15 from a spin compensated , kondo - like phase , reached in the strong @xmath4 interaction regime .",
    "the exact value of @xmath22 is not known but there is a consensus that this transition is in the same class of universality of the 1d quantum ising model  @xcite .",
    "the great controversy arises when we consider the anisotropy parameter in the region @xmath23 . in this case",
    "the two phases described above are still present but it is on debate if a critical value of anisotropy is required for the appearance of long - range magnetic order , as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , or if it is present for any value of anisotropy , as reported in refs .  @xcite",
    ". other important point of discussion is the class of universality of the ordered - disordered transition .",
    "rg calculation indicates it is a second order phase transition but the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed it is of kosterlitz - thouless type .    to investigate the critical behaviour of the 1d anisotropic kn model at zero temperature we use an estimator of quantum criticality based on the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in gapless and gapfull systems .",
    "this method has proved to be a powerful numerical tool to precisely locate quantum critical points and calculate the central charge with low computational cost ( small lattice sizes ) in a large variety of 1d quantum systems  @xcite . by considering systems with sizes of up to 24 spins",
    ", we found that the t=0 phase diagram of this model is described by a critical line separating an antiferromagnetic long range order , which is present for any finite value of anisotropy , from a non - magnetic kondo singlet phase .",
    "this general result is in accordance to lanczos and dmrg calculations .",
    "however , we have calculated the conformal anomaly on the critical line and obtained that @xmath1 tends to @xmath2 as the system size increases .",
    "hence we conclude that the transitions for any @xmath24 belong to ising universality class and , therefore , they are of the second order kind instead of infinite order as claimed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we outline the formalism adopted and , in the last section , we present and discuss our results .",
    "in this work we present a systematic study of the quantum behaviour of the model described by eq .",
    "[ eqh ] at @xmath0 . to identify the critical coupling ( @xmath16 ) and anisotropy ( @xmath14 ) separating the various quantal phases of the system we employ an estimator of quantum criticality based on the von neumann entanglement entropy .",
    "it works in the following way .",
    "let us consider a quantum system of @xmath25 spins in a pure state @xmath26 and a bipartition of the system into two blocks : a block of @xmath27 contiguous spins and other containing the spins of the rest of the chain ( @xmath28 spins ) .",
    "the entanglement entropy between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote the reduced density matrix for block @xmath27 , with @xmath31 . as it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the quantity defined in eq .",
    "[ vn ] presents a very interesting scaling behaviour in 1d systems .",
    "suppose this system is dependent of a given parameter , let us say @xmath32 , and at @xmath33 it presents a qcp .",
    "in the critical point , conformal invariance implies a diverging logarithmic scaling which can be written as @xmath34 + \\beta \\label{vns}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a nonuniversal constant and @xmath36 is a constant related to the central charge , namely @xmath37 when periodic boundary conditions are adopted in the chain . if @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the entanglement entropy @xmath40 is not only independent of @xmath27 but also independent of @xmath25 .",
    "there is entanglement only between sites separated by a distance of the order of the correlation length ( @xmath41 ) , and this quantity of entanglement is unchanged by a variation of either @xmath25 or @xmath27 when both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are very large .    the estimator used throughout the paper was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and it is given by the difference of the entanglement entropy obtained for two subsystems of different sizes , for example , @xmath27 and @xmath42 , of a system of total size @xmath25 . we write this as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the entanglement entropies between @xmath27 and @xmath46 and between @xmath42 and @xmath47 , respectively . from the expressions",
    "above , we see that as @xmath48 , @xmath49 at the critical point while it is zero for any value of @xmath38 . therefore @xmath50 is a good indicator of quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit . for a finite size system",
    "the scaling of @xmath44 described above is not exact anymore but the result obtained for @xmath51 can be easily generalized . in this case",
    ", it is expected that @xmath49 for all values of @xmath32 but at @xmath33 it attains its maximum value . in this way",
    ", @xmath51 works as an estimator of criticality : to locate a qcp for a fixed finite system size we should look for the value of @xmath32 for which @xmath51 is a maximum . as l increases the peak around @xmath52 should become narrower , so that in the thermodynamic limit it is the only value different from zero .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the choice of @xmath27 and @xmath42 for this method is arbitrary but the finite - size effects on @xmath44 are smaller if they are chosen around the middle of the chain .",
    "an interesting characteristic of this method is that it allows to obtain a unique value of the critical parameter and central charge for each @xmath25 , enabling us to estimate their values in the thermodynamic limit by extrapolation .",
    "this approach has been tested in different models and the results have shown that this is an excellent numerical method to study quantum criticality in 1d systems  @xcite .",
    "in order to apply the estimator to the kn model we consider subsystems containing @xmath27 and @xmath42 spins of a periodic chain with @xmath25 spins .",
    "note that , in eq .",
    "[ eqh ] , n represents the number of sites of the system in an open chain , since there are two spins at each site it implies that @xmath53 ( as an example , we show in fig.(1 ) , a schematic representation of the chain with @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the adoption of periodic boundary condition in the kn model means that we should take the first sum in eq .",
    "[ eqh ] up to @xmath56 , considering @xmath57 , keeping the second one as it is .    initially , to test the method",
    ", we will discuss the critical point and the central charge of the kn model for the specific case of @xmath58 .",
    "it is a good starting - point since there is not a great controversy about these results in the literature . to calculate @xmath51 we can choose the blocks , @xmath27 and @xmath42 , of arbitrary size . in this primary example",
    ", we will use two different bipartitions of the system : ( a ) @xmath59 and @xmath60 and ( b ) @xmath59 and @xmath61 . in the first case",
    "we take @xmath27 and @xmath42 fixed ratios of @xmath25 such that the difference between them , @xmath62 , increases with @xmath25 , for the second bipartition , this difference remains constant , @xmath63 .",
    "we will compare the accuracy of the numerical results and the optimal bipartition will be used to investigate the critical line in the interval @xmath23 .",
    "the basic steps of the approximation , valid for the two bipartitions , are : firstly , we use power method ( an iterative eigenvalue algorithm  @xcite ) to obtain the ground state of the chain for a given fixed value of @xmath25 up to @xmath64 spins .",
    "then , we calculate @xmath44 and @xmath45 as defined in eq .",
    "[ vn ] and subtract them to obtain @xmath51 . to locate the qcps we fix the value of @xmath14=1 and look for the value of @xmath15 that gives the maximum value of @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , due to the geometry of the lattice , we just can choose some specific values of @xmath25 to study the correlations along the chain .",
    "in fact , the values allowed for @xmath25 depend on the bipartition of the system : for the case ( a ) , the chain should contain @xmath65 , and @xmath64 spins , while for ( b ) , @xmath25 can be equal to @xmath66 , and @xmath64 spins .",
    "the critical coupling in the thermodynamic limit is estimated , in both cases , by extrapolating the values of @xmath15 found for each spin system size , for larger @xmath25 .",
    "let us present the results for the two bipartitions separately .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath59 and @xmath60    as discussed in the last section , as @xmath67 increases , @xmath68 , except in the critical point where it tends to : @xmath69 this result can also be written as : @xmath70 from this expression we see that , just like @xmath51 , @xmath1 is a maximum at the critical point .",
    "thus , once we have localized @xmath71 we use the corresponding maximum value of @xmath51 to calculate @xmath1 in eq .",
    "[ nc ] for each l. the value of @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit is estimated by extrapolation .    in fig .",
    "[ nf2 ] we show the evolution of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath21 . as we can see",
    ", the maximum of @xmath51 occurs in @xmath72 and , as @xmath25 increases , the peak becomes narrower around this value . with the value of @xmath71 in hands ,",
    "the calculation of the central charge is a simple application of eq .",
    "[ nc ] . in table",
    "[ ntab2 ] we show the values of @xmath71 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "see that theses parameters converge fastly to the values @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as @xmath25 increases .",
    "therefore we believe that they are good numerical approximation to the true values of the quantum critical point , which are reached only in the thermodynamic limit . based on this approximation",
    ", we conclude that @xmath73 corresponds to the qcp of the system for @xmath21 and that , this transition , characterized by @xmath74 , belongs to the ising universality class .",
    ".system size dependence of the critical coupling , @xmath22 , and the central charge , @xmath1 , at the qcp of the anisotropic kn model for @xmath58 , by considering the bipartition ( a ) .",
    "the values of these parameters in the thermodynamic limit are estimated by extrapolation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     following the procedure described above , we have calculated the central charge at the critical point for several values of @xmath14 .",
    "our results show that the estimated value for @xmath1 is @xmath2 for the entire line . as an example of our calculations , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the values of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath25 obtained for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we see clearly that @xmath1 tends to @xmath2 , as l increases , for both values of anisotropy .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the transitions along the line belong to the quantum 1d ising model universality class and they are of the second order type .",
    "in summary , we have examined the qpts of the 1d kondo necklace model in the presence of an ising - like anisotropy .",
    "the model is suitable to describe heavy fermion systems and emphasizes magnetic degrees of freedom neglecting charge fluctuations . by using an estimator of quantum criticality based on the behaviour of the entanglement entropy  @xcite",
    ", we found that the t=0 phase diagram of this model is described by a critical line separating an antiferromagnetic long range order , which is present for any finite value of anisotropy , from a non - magnetic kondo singlet phase .",
    "this general result is in accordance to lanczos and dmrg calculation .",
    "however we have calculated the central charge on the critical line and obtained that @xmath77 , as @xmath25 increases , for any @xmath24 .",
    "hence we conclude that these transitions along the line belong to the ising universality class and , therefore , they are of the second order type instead of infinite order as claimed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to note the similarity between the phases diagrams of the anisotropic kn model , as obtained here , and that of the @xmath78 model in a transverse field ( @xmath32 ) obtained by barouch and mccoy in ref .",
    "the isotropic ( @xmath20 ) version of both systems presents an infinite order critical point ( @xmath79 for the kn model and @xmath80 for the @xmath78 hamiltonian ) , however , any perturbation in the anisotropic parameter ( any @xmath81 ) turns the critical behaviour of the spin chains from the universality class of the @xmath82 model into that of the ising model . in the kn model ,",
    "the @xmath83 ( @xmath4 ) interaction plays the role of the transverse field in the @xmath78 model : it destroys the correlations along the chain leading the system to a paramagnetic phase .",
