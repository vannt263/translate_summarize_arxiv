    "extensive studies of galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) have shown that the spectral transitions can be related to the mass accretion rate ( e.g. done , gierliski & kubota 2007 , gilvanof 2010 ) .",
    "when the thermal component ( disc blackbody ) dominates the spectrum and the luminosity is moderate the disc is optically thick and geometrically thin . in such a case , the accreting gas rotates with keplerian velocity and eventually reaches the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) from where it rapidly falls towards the black hole . in this case",
    ", isco may be identified with the radiation inner edge @xcite , since the radiation emitted from inside the isco is negligible @xcite .",
    "note , however , that @xcite found that by using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of accretion on to black holes , significant emissivity can be expected inside isco radius . in terms of the eddington luminosity , @xmath12 , such spectral state",
    "is commonly found within luminosity range of @xmath13 0.1  0.3 @xmath12 . in this thermal state",
    "( sometimes referred to as the high / soft state ) , the accretion flow can be described by the so - called standard disc model @xcite .",
    "the relativistic version of this model was derived by @xcite .    using the standard disc model it is possible to derive the black hole spin , disc luminosity and inclination from x - ray continuum fitting .",
    "the black hole spin is generally estimated assuming that the disc inner edge is at isco ( see shafee et al . 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "such an approach led to measurements of a wide range of black hole spins , @xmath14@xmath15 @xcite , which urges the need for theoretical models in which the black hole spin is fully taken into account .",
    "however , caution should be taken when one considers black hole systems at the luminosity close to the eddington since the accretion disc is no longer properly described by the standard disc theory .",
    "as the mass accretion rate increases , the radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure and the cooling is provided by both vertical radiative flux and horizontal advection @xcite . as a result , disc can not maintain its thin geometry ( becomes thicker or slim ) and the inner edge of the disc goes closer to the black hole .",
    "the disc becomes less radiatively efficient since the produced heat is not totally emitted locally but some fraction of it is advected inward and emitted at smaller radii or swallowed by the black hole .",
    "therefore , radiation from inside the isco may be not negligible and isco is no longer the radiation inner edge ( e.g. watarai & mineshige 2003 ) . to study such a flow , @xcite proposed slim disc model which contains solutions corresponding to near - eddington and moderately super - eddington accretion rates , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the eddington mass accretion rate defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "that is , @xmath20 for a non - rotating black hole , @xmath17 approximately corresponds to the eddington luminosity .",

    ", slim disc model has been studied by many authors . @xcite",

    "flatter spectrum in the soft - x band as a result of flatter effective temperature profile , @xmath22 , becomes the main feature that distinguishes slim disc from that of the standard disc .",
    "watarai , mizuno & mineshige ( 2001a ) study the application of slim disc model for ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "this is an interesting study since the application of slim disc model for ulxs challenges the idea of intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) for ulxs .",
    "@xcite investigates the application of slim disc model for narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) pg 1448 + 273 ( see also szuszkiewicz , malkan & abramowicz 1996 ; wang & zhou 1999 ; mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ; haba et al .",
    "these studies , however , do not adopt a full - relativistic formalism , but instead adopt the pseudo - newtonian potential , @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "in addition , they only consider a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black hole case .",
    "the relativistic effects are included in the spectrum calculation at best .",

    "@xcite show that the slim disc state was observed in xte j1550564 data during the high / soft state when the luminosity exceeds the critical luminosity .",
    "in present days , slim disc model has been widely used to fit the spectra of many luminous x - ray sources . the small inner radius ( @xmath25 isco ) and the flat temperature profile obtained from the fitting are commonly claimed as the slim disc evidences ( e.g. tsunoda et al .",
    "2006 ; okajima , ebisawa & kawaguchi 2006 ) .",
    "however , unlike the standard model , in which the radiation edge coincides with the isco , the black hole spin estimate from the spectral fitting is not straightforward .",
    "@xcite revisited the study of slim disc around kerr black holes .",
    "they focused on the parameters which are applicable to stellar mass bhbs .",
    "more importantly , fully relativistic slim disc model provides a tool to study the signatures of black hole spin in the spectra . in @xcite , however , the effect of wind - mass loss is not taken into account . at high mass accretion rate ,",
    "wind - mass loss becomes important , due to significant radiation pressure ( takeuchi , mineshige & ohsuga 2009 ) .",
    "however , as takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have shown , the temperature and scale height radial profiles of the slim disc are hardly affected by non - constant profile of mass accretion rate . in the present study , we try to bridge the gap between theory and observations by fitting the relativistic slim disc spectra with the extended disc blackbody ( extended dbb ) model ( also known as @xmath26-free model ; mineshige et al .",
    "1994 ) .    unlike mass",
    ", black hole spin is much more difficult to measure since it only affects the region very close to the event horizon and thus much less observable from a large distance .",
    "nevertheless , there have been several attempts to measure the black hole spin by using the x - ray spectral fitting ( see mcclintock et al .",
    "2010 , and references there in ) .",
    "the disc spectra in these studies , however , are assumed to be in the standard thermal state which can not be suitable for high mass accretion rate systems .",
    "for this reason , @xcite , carefully selected data with luminosity below 30% of the eddington luminosity . to overcome",
    "this limitation , fitting with relativistic slim disc model will be important .",
    "to understand the observed properties of black hole accretion flows shining at around the eddington luminosity , we fit the synthetic spectra of high mass accretion rate discs based on the fully relativistic slim disc model with the extended dbb fitting model . assuming that the relativistic slim disc model is a better representation of the realistic situations , we aim ( 1 ) to give a new methodology to evaluate black hole spins from the x - ray spectral fitting of the luminous objects whose luminosity exceed @xmath27 , and ( 2 ) to give reasonable interpretation to the peculiar behavior of grs 1915 + 105 in the @xmath8  @xmath28 diagram ( vierdayanti , mineshige & ueda 2010 ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : we will review the relativistic slim disc model @xcite and the spectrum calculations in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we investigate the effects of the mass accretion rate , black hole spin and viewing angle on the extended dbb model parameters .",
    "we present the comparison of our study with the observations of grs 1915 + 105 in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss some remaining issues from our study , such as the interpretation of @xmath4 , the disc geometry and the black hole spin .",
    "we conclude the paper in section 6 .",
    "slim disc model was introduced in the late 1980s by the warsaw and the kyoto groups ( abramowicz et al .",

    "slim discs are astrophysically important since they can be applied to accretion flows with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this range of accretion rate has been observed in some galactic and extra - galactic x - ray sources .    in this work we use the slim disc solutions around kerr black hole obtained by @xcite , hereafter s11 .",
    "we will only review the main results of this work while the details can be found in the paper .      when the luminosity approaches or moderately exceeds the eddington luminosity ( equation ( 1 ) )",
    ", the generated energy can no longer be totally emitted locally due to photon trapping .",
    "some fraction of the generated photons are trapped by the gas and advected inward due to high ( scattering ) optical depth .",
    "the slim disc solutions deviate from that of the standard disc when advection becomes important .",
    "4.11 of s11 shows the increase of heat advected with the increase of mass accretion rate .",
    "some part of the advected heat will go too close to the black hole and can not escape .",
    "some other part will be emitted in the smaller radii so that it will amplify the local emission by the viscous process .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4.2 of s11 , the peak in the radial profiles of the flux for the higher mass accretion rates is shifted to the smaller radii . in the case of highly spinning black hole",
    ", the shift is particularly less visible due to the common shift caused by the decreasing radius of the isco with the increasing spin parameter .",
    "the @xmath30 ratio , where @xmath31 is the disc scale height and @xmath32 is the disc radii , and the central temperature profiles are consistent with previous studies ( see fig .",
    "4.5 of s11 ) . as the mass accretion rate increases ,",
    "the radiation pressure dominated region is formed in the inner region of the disc which results in an increase of the @xmath30 ratio .",
    "the increase of the @xmath30 ratio produces significant effects on the spectra which will be described in the next subsection .",
    "the temperature of the gas pressure dominated region increases more rapidly with decreasing radius than that in the radiation pressure dominated region .",
    "that is , the radial profiles of the temperature at the inner region become flatter as mass accretion rate increases .    for moderately high accretion rates , i.e. the case of optically thick and geometrically thin disc , the energy conversion efficiency @xmath33 is constant ( does not depend on the accretion rate ) , since the luminosity increases proportionally with @xmath1 . when the accretion rate increases , the inner edge of the disc leaves the isco and moves inward . in addition , photon trapping effect becomes important that suppresses the photons from being emitted from the surface of the disc . therefore , the luminosity is not proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "instead , it grows slower than @xmath1 ( s11 and references therein ) .      in the previous studies ( e.g. watarai et al .",
    "2000 , 2001a , 2001b , hereafter w0001 ) , where the pseudo - newtonian potential was adopted and the schwarzschild ( non - rotating ) black hole was assumed , the slim disc model was found to exhibit several important signatures : the spectra are multicolor blackbody characterized by a high maximum temperature ( @xmath34 a few kev ) , a small emitting region ( @xmath35 ) , and flatter spectra in the soft x - ray band due to a flatter effective temperature profile .",
    "the slim disc model used in our study is constructed in the kerr space - time metric and the spectra include all special and general relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "the ray - tracing method is used to calculate the emission from the proper effective photosphere to an observer at infinity .",
    "the deviation of the observed spectra from a pure multi - color blackbody , due to the change in the disc opacity , is taken care by a spectral hardening factor , @xmath36 , which is the ratio between the color temperature and effective temperature .",

    "however , at a certain point ( @xmath45 ) , the spectrum becomes softer as @xmath3 increases further , in opposite to the face - on case .",
    "the total flux , on the other hand , decreases significantly .",
    "we fit the synthetic spectra of the relativistic slim disc model with the extended disc blackbody ( extended dbb ) fitting model , the so - called @xmath26free model @xcite , at 3  20 kev range .",
    "the parameters of the spectrum model used in our study are the black hole mass ( @xmath46 ) , mass accretion rate ( @xmath47 ) , dimensionless spin parameter ( @xmath48 ) , and viewing angle ( @xmath41  @xmath42 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will write @xmath49 instead of @xmath37 , for the case of non - rotating black hole , throughout the text ( except in figures and tables ) for the readers convenience .    the extended disc blackbody has three fitting parameters : @xmath4 , @xmath50 , and @xmath26 which are the maximum temperature of the disc , the radius where @xmath51 , and the temperature gradient , respectively . in our present study",
    "we put most interest in the radius which defines the size of the emitting region , denoted as @xmath52 , which is most useful for comparison with observations .",
    "we calculate @xmath52 using disc luminosity and disc effective temperature , @xmath53 .",
    "the disc luminosity is calculated from the theoretical spectrum within 3  20 kev energy range .",
    "the effective temperature is calculated from the maximum disc temperature , @xmath54 , with @xmath36 being a fixed spectral hardening factor .",
    "we use @xmath55 , as used in the model calculation .",
    "in addition to @xmath36 , relativistic correction factor @xmath56 is included when calculating @xmath52 , implying that the maximum temperature occurs at somewhat larger radius @xcite .",

    "the saturation is caused by energy advection ( photon trapping ) .",
    "due to energy advection , emergent flux profile in the inner parts is no longer dependent on @xmath1 ( see the upper right part of the spectra at high @xmath1 in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . in addition",
    ", the saturation can also be interpreted as an evidence that the disc has reached the smallest disc radius , @xmath50 , from which a maximum possible value of flux can be emitted .",
    "this smallest radius is not necessary the inner edge of the disc whose estimation is not trivial .",
    "also , it may differ from @xmath52 , the size of the emitting region .",

    "the high maximum disc temperature commonly found in grs 1915 + 105 is also an important signature of slim disc at high viewing angle .",

    "when @xmath81 , the maximum disc temperature can reach 2 kev or even slightly higher .",
    "we suggest that the disc - dominated data of grs 1915 + 105 used in vmu2010 are the first evidence of relativistic slim disc theory and its obscuration at high spin parameter and viewing angle .",
    "the relativistic effects should play a significant role as the inner edge of the disc gets closer to the black hole .",
    "the estimate of the inner edge radius would require a full knowledge of the gravitational redshift and the light bending .",
    "it is very likely that this inner edge is a region that is visually hidden to the observer , from which the emission can not escape along his line of sight .",
    "it implies that the observed innermost disc temperature , @xmath4 , may not be the real maximum temperature of the disc when relativistic effects become important .",

    "we know that the inner edge of the disc can reach @xmath90 for @xmath49 and @xmath91 for @xmath38 at @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the saturation of @xmath50 shows that the emission from the innermost part at @xmath92 is not captured by the extended dbb model even when @xmath93 .",
    "since the innermost part of the disc is invisible , we automatically lose the information of the real maximum temperature of the disc . in the case of high-@xmath3 ,",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated especially at high @xmath1 due to the obscuration effect . unless we know @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 of the observed systems , it is difficult to estimate the real maximum temperature of the disc from observation .",
    "ironically , we usually estimate @xmath1 and @xmath2 from observable parameters such as @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "so far the comparison between the theory and observations based on spectral fitting has been made mainly to check the surface temperature profile of the disc .",
    "the present study provides another way of comparison , since it can test not only the surface temperature profile but also the disc geometry ( i.e. , the disc height distribution , @xmath94 ) .",
    "the observed behavior of the disc on the @xmath8 ",
    "@xmath4 diagram can provide an independent support to the relativistic slim disc model .    in the standard picture of accretion disc ,",
    "the disc is assumed to be geometrically thin .",
    "that is , the disc obscuration becomes less important except when the viewing angle is @xmath95 . in the slim disc model ,",
    "however , the disc geometry becomes thicker from that of the standard case when the radiation pressure becomes important . on the other hand , the photon trapping due to advective motion will reduce the disc geometrical thickness .",
    "therefore , as the photon trapping becomes effective , we expect the decrease of the disc geometrical thickness , as can be seen in fig .",
    "5 .    in fig . 5",
    ", we can also see that the photon trapping starts to become effective at larger radii as @xmath1 increases .",

    "it explains why at moderately high viewing angle , we could never see the inner part of the disc when mass accretion rate is extremely high , @xmath96 .",
    "estimating the spin parameter is not an easy task especially if we only have a short range of luminosity data . in the case of low viewing angle ,",

    "it is interesting to note in this respect that @xcite , due to their selection criteria , mainly used high luminosity data of grs 1915 + 105 and derived lower spin parameter value , @xmath99 .",
    "we can now understand the reason for this ; if we fit the upper branch data ( at high luminosities ) by the standard disc theory , we will get lower spin parameters ( see fig . 8) .    we also need to address the absorption ( both continuum and line ) model issue .",
    "accurate estimation of the column densities of major elements in the interstellar matter between the source and the observer becomes very crucial , especially for grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "it will significantly affect the energy range of the x - ray emission from bhbs .",
    "vmu2010 followed @xcite in modeling the absorption by the interstellar and circumstellar gas .",
    "@xcite in their study used the data from simultaneous _",
    "hetgs and _ rxte _ observations which give better statistics than some previous studies ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "the fitting results , however , seem to have a strong dependence on the absorption model .",
    "the results may change when different treatment for the absorption , i.e. different absorption model , is applied which remains an open question .",
    "we have studied the observational signatures of the relativistic slim disc ( s11 ) by fitting the synthetic spectra with the extended dbb model . the dependence of these signatures on the accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) , black hole spin ( @xmath2 ) , and inclination angle ( @xmath3 ) have been investigated .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to estimate those physical parameters from observations .",
    "we found a new parameter , @xmath7 , which depends on the spin parameter for high viewing angles .",
    "we also found that the two branches found by vmu2010 on @xmath8  @xmath4 plane can be explained by the relativistic slim disc model .",
    "we suggest that the disc - dominated data of grs 1915 + 105 used in vmu2010 is the first evidence of the relativistic slim disc and its obscuration at high spin parameter and viewing angle .",
