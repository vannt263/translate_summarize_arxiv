    "this paper continues the investigations carried out in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite concerning the schwartz kernel of the boundary values of the resolvent @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ( positive ) laplacian @xmath17 on an asymptotically conic manifold @xmath18 , or more generally a schrdinger operator @xmath19 where @xmath5 is a suitable potential function .",
    "this was done for a fixed real @xmath20 in @xcite and @xcite ( and valid uniformly for @xmath20 in a compact interval of @xmath21 ) , for @xmath22 in @xcite and for @xmath23 , with @xmath24 real and tending to zero , that is , inside the resolvent set but approaching the bottom of the spectrum , @xmath25 , in @xcite ( and also in @xcite , where zero eigenvalues and zero - resonances were treated ) . here",
    "we treat the case @xmath20 real and tending to zero .",
    "one of the main reasons for doing this is to obtain results about the spectral measure , which can be expressed in terms of the difference between the outgoing and incoming resolvents @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "very complete results about the singularity structure of the spectral measure are known from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for @xmath28 for any @xmath29 . to complete the picture",
    "we derive the asymptotics as @xmath9 here .",
    "we can then , at least in principle , analyze the schwartz kernel of any function of @xmath16 by integrating over the spectral measure . in the present paper we use our result on the low - energy asymptotics of the spectral measure to deduce long - time asymptotics of the wave and schrdinger propagators determined by @xmath16 . in future articles , we will treat two aspects of functional calculus for laplace - type operators on an asymptotically conic manifold : ( i ) restriction estimates , that is @xmath30 estimates on the spectral measure , and @xmath31 estimates for fairly general functions of the laplacian , and ( ii ) long - time dispersion and strichartz estimates for solutions of the schrdinger equation on nontrapping asymptotically conic manifolds .",
    "the geometric setting for our analysis is the same as in @xcite , which we now recall .",
    "let @xmath32 be a complete noncompact riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath33 with one end , diffeomorphic to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a smooth compact connected manifold without boundary .",
    "( the assumption that @xmath35 is connected is for simplicity of exposition ; see remark  [ manyends ] . )",
    "we assume that @xmath0 admits a compactification @xmath2 to a smooth compact manifold with boundary , with @xmath36 , such that the metric @xmath1 becomes a _ scattering metric _ or _ asymptotically conic metric _ on @xmath2 .",
    "that means that there is a boundary defining function @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( i.e.  @xmath39 and @xmath40 does not vanish on @xmath38 ) such that in a collar neighbourhood @xmath41 near @xmath38 , @xmath1 takes the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a smooth family of metrics on @xmath35 .",
    "we then call @xmath0 an asymptotically conic manifold , or a scattering manifold . notice that if @xmath44 is independent of @xmath37 for small @xmath45 , then setting @xmath46 the metric reads @xmath47 which is a conic metric ; in this sense , the metric @xmath1 is asymptotically conic . for a general scattering metric taking the form",
    ", we view @xmath46 as a generalized ` radial coordinate ' , as the distance to any fixed point of @xmath2 is given by @xmath48 as @xmath49 .",
    "a metric cone itself is not an example of an asymptotically conic manifold , since cone points are not allowed , except in the case of euclidean space , where the cone point is a removable singularity . in spite of this",
    ", the methods of this paper apply to metric cones , and in fact we analyze the resolvent kernel on a metric cone as an ingredient of our analysis on asymptotically conic manifolds .",
    "we let @xmath5 be a real potential function on @xmath2 such that @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the ( positive ) laplacian with respect to the metric @xmath52 , we let @xmath53 be the set of increasing eigenvalues of @xmath54 and the condition in is that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath55 is _ strictly _ positive . notice that @xmath56 is not allowed if @xmath57 , but is allowed for @xmath58 , and indeed then @xmath59 could be somewhat negative : for example , any negative constant greater than @xmath60 .",
    "we shall further assume that @xmath61 ( recall that a zero - resonance of @xmath16 is a solution @xmath62 to @xmath63 where @xmath64 , but @xmath65 at infinity .",
    "zero - resonances do not exist when @xmath66 . )",
    "let @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath16 , with domain @xmath67 , is self - adjoint on @xmath68 and a consequence of and is that its spectrum is the union of absolutely continuous spectrum on @xmath69 together with possibly a finite number of negative eigenvalues .",
    "it is known that , for @xmath70 , the limits @xmath71 exist as bounded operators from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , for any @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the schwartz kernels of these operators determines that of the spectral measure of @xmath7 , where @xmath75 denotes the positive part of @xmath16 , according to stone s formula @xmath76      we just mentioned above that , for any positive @xmath20 , the boundary values @xmath26 of the resolvent exist as bounded operators from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , for any @xmath74 .",
    "however , this is not true uniformly down to @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the limit @xmath9 of the resolvent kernel is a singular limit , which can be seen e.g. from explicit formulae for the resolvent kernel on flat euclidean space .",
    "the outgoing resolvent kernel on @xmath78 has ( modulo constant factors ) asymptotics @xmath79 for fixed @xmath70 and @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for @xmath9 and @xmath82 fixed ( provided @xmath58 ) .",
    "these asymptotics do not match , and there is a transitional asymptotic regime in which we send @xmath9 while holding @xmath83 fixed . in the special case of @xmath78 the resolvent kernel is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the hankel function of the first kind and order @xmath86 .",
    "thus in this case we can see explicitly the transitional asymptotic regime , interpolating between the oscillatory behaviour of the kernel for positive @xmath20 and the polyhomogeneous behaviour at @xmath77 .    in this paper ,",
    "following @xcite and more generally melrose s program @xcite , we analyze the different asymptotic regimes of the resolvent kernel by working on a compactified and blown - up version , denoted stands for the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "we write @xmath24 rather than @xmath20 in this notation to agree with the notation of @xcite , where the same space was used to construct @xmath87 , @xmath88 . ]",
    "@xmath89 , of the space @xmath90 \\label{naturaldomain}\\ ] ] which is the natural domain of definition of the kernel @xmath26 for @xmath91 .",
    "the idea is to realize asymptotic regimes geometrically so that each regime corresponds to a boundary hypersurface , and we consider the space to be  sufficiently blown up \" when the resolvent kernel lifts to be conormal at the lifted diagonal and either legendrian , or polyhomogeneous conormal , at each boundary hypersurface .",
    "that means , in particular , that there is nothing  hidden \" at any of the corners , or in other words that if we have two intersecting hypersurfaces @xmath92 and @xmath93 , that the expansion at @xmath94 can be obtained by taking the expansion at @xmath92 and restricting the coefficients , which are functions on @xmath92 , to @xmath94 , or conversely by taking the expansion at @xmath93 and restricting the coefficients to @xmath95 .",
    "in the example above , the expansions for @xmath9 for fixed @xmath96 and at @xmath80 for fixed @xmath20 do not match , and this requires ( in our approach ) that the corner in between be blown up , to create a hypersurface on which the transitional asymptotics take place .",
    "expansions of the resolvent as @xmath9 were first considered by jensen - kato @xcite for schrdinger operators on @xmath97 and generalized by murata @xcite to general dimension and general constant coefficient operators .",
    "more recently , there have been several studies by wang @xcite , bouclet @xcite , bony - hfner @xcite and vasy - wunsch @xcite on resolvent estimates ( based on commutator estimates and mourre theory ) at low energy , for asymptotically euclidean or asymptotically conic metrics .",
    "wang s paper @xcite is particularly close in spirit to the current paper , and we discuss it further in remark  [ wang ] .    to describe previous results from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we refer to figures [ mmkb ] and [ fig : mmksc ] which are illustrations of the manifolds @xmath89 and @xmath98 , two blown - up versions of @xmath99 $ ] . here , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are respectively the boundary hypersurfaces of @xmath103 $ ] corresponding to @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath77 ( we use unprimed variables to refer to the left copy of @xmath2 and primed variables to refer to the right copy of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the other hypersurfaces are created by blowup .",
    "notice that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are `` at @xmath77 '' , while the others are `` at positive @xmath20 '' .    in @xcite , @xcite the boundary value of the resolvent , @xmath26 , for fixed @xmath70 , was shown to be the sum of a pseudodifferential operator ( in the scattering calculus of melrose @xcite ) and a legendre distribution of a certain specific type , with respect to several legendre submanifolds associated to the diagonal and to the geodesic flow on @xmath2 , or more precisely to a limiting flow at ` infinity ' . in terms of the picture in figure",
    "[ fig : mmksc ] this means that , on a fixed @xmath70 slice , the kernel is oscillatory at the boundaries @xmath108 and can be written as an oscillatory function or oscillatory integral with respect to phase functions determined by geodesic flow on @xmath2 .    on the other hand , in @xcite the resolvent @xmath109 was analyzed for real @xmath110 on the space @xmath89 . because @xmath24 is in the resolvent set whenever @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the largest negative eigenvalue of @xmath16 , the kernel of the resolvent has exponential decay away from the diagonal , and hence vanishes exponentially at the faces @xmath113 and @xmath101 .",
    "however , the rate of exponential decay vanishes as @xmath110 and , consequently , the kernel has nontrivial expansions at @xmath114 as well of course at @xmath102 and @xmath107 ( which meet the diagonal ) , and the focus of @xcite was the precise analysis of these ( polyhomogeneous ) expansions .",
    "the point of the current paper is to unify the two constructions . a precise statement of the result",
    "is given in theorem  [ mainres ] , after definitions of legendre distributions on the space @xmath115 have been given .",
    "for now , let us say that a kernel is conormal - legendrian on the space @xmath115 if it lies in the calculus of legendre distributions given in section  [ leg ] ; roughly this means that it is oscillatory at the faces @xmath108 and polyhomogeneous conormal at the other faces , on which @xmath77 .",
    "the boundary value of the resolvent kernel , @xmath26 , is the sum of a pseudodifferential operator , i.e.  a kernel on @xmath89 , supported close to and conormal to the diagonal @xmath116 , and a conormal - legendrian on @xmath115 .",
    "we determine the structure of the spectral measure by subtracting the incoming from the outgoing resolvent .",
    "there are two different cancellations that occur when we do this .",
    "first the singularity along the diagonal disappears ( not surprisingly , since the spectral measure solves an elliptic equation ) and secondly there is cancellation in the asymptotic expansion for fixed @xmath117 as @xmath20 goes to zero .",
    "the second cancellation is quite important in applications , such as in understanding the decay of the heat kernel or propagator for long time .",
    "[ mainth ] the kernel of the spectral projection is conormal - legendrian on @xmath115 , and vanishes to order @xmath118 as @xmath9 with @xmath119 fixed , where @xmath55 is the lowest eigenvalue of the operator . in particular , if @xmath120 ( or even if just @xmath121 ) , the spectral projection vanishes to order @xmath122 as @xmath9 with @xmath119 fixed .",
    "more precisely , there is a nontrivial solution @xmath123 to @xmath124 , with @xmath125 as @xmath126 , such that the expansion at @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the second eigenvalue of the operator .",
    "moreover , if @xmath5 is identically zero , then @xmath123 is constant .",
    "see theorem  [ mainsm ] for a more precise statement of this result .",
    "we now give two corollaries of theorem  [ mainth ] concerning the long - time behaviour of the wave and schrdinger kernels associated to @xmath16 .",
    "we write @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",

    "this result is closely related to price s law , which is the statement that waves on a schwarzschild spacetime , starting with localized initial data , decay to order @xmath149 ( outside the event horizon ) as @xmath14 .",
    "this @xmath149 decay was predicted in @xcite and has been proved recently by donninger - schlag - soffer @xcite for exact schwarzschild using separation of variables and by tataru @xcite for more general settings .",
    "although our result does not apply directly to the schwarzschild case , it does apply to asymptotically flat manifolds which are isometric to schwarzschild near infinity , or more generally to asymptotically conic manifolds with a ` gravitational ' type metric at infinity , that is , of the form near @xmath150 @xmath151 the case @xmath152 requires a minor extension to the analysis of section  [ lerc ] given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the same is true with @xmath13 replaced by either of the wave solution operators .",
    "we also remark that , instead of localizing the variables @xmath161 in compact sets , we could work instead in appropriately weighted sobolev spaces .",
    "[ wang ] x. p. wang s paper @xcite is quite close in spirit to the present paper .",
    "he also studies manifolds with ( exactly ) conical ends , and derives low energy asymptotics for the resolvent , as well as large time expansions for the propagator similar to the corollaries above .",
    "in fact , his results are more general than ours in some respects , as he treats higher order asymptotic terms , and also allows zero modes and zero resonances . on the other hand , our results are more complete in that we consider expansions at all boundary hypersurfaces of @xmath89 , while wang only considers ( in our terminology ) expansions at the @xmath102 boundary hypersurface .",
    "our expansions are also more explicit : for example , it does not seem easy to see from @xcite that the leading asymptotic for the propagator is a rank one operator ( under our assumptions ) , as in .",

    "consequently , the diagonal singularity cancels in the expression , and the spectral measure is smooth across the diagonal . another way to see this is that the spectral measure satisfies an elliptic equation @xmath1094 , so it can not have any local singularities .",
    "moreover , the difference between the outgoing  @xmath1095 \" piece and the incoming  @xmath1095 \" piece ( in the terminology of theorem  [ mainres ] ) , which are intersecting legendre distributions associated to @xmath1096 and @xmath1097 respectively , is a legendrian associated to the propagating legendrian @xmath405 alone .",
    "this is because the left hamilton vector field is nonzero at @xmath1098 , and tangent to @xmath405 .",
    "since legendrian regularity propagates on @xmath405 along the hamilton vector field , the spectral measure is legendre across @xmath410 , i.e.  it is a legendre distribution on @xmath115 associated to the intersecting pair of legendre submanifolds with conic points @xmath1099 .",
    "we start by giving the leading asymptotics of the spectral measure at the boundary hypersurfaces @xmath1100 . at @xmath107 ( and also at @xmath1101 ) we have already determined the leading asymptotic of the outgoing resolvent  see .",
    "since the imaginary part of @xmath1102 is @xmath1103 , we see from that the leading asymptotic of the spectral measure @xmath1088 at @xmath107 is at order @xmath999 , and is given by @xmath1104 , that is @xmath1105 similarly , at @xmath718 , @xmath1106 times the imaginary part of the resolvent kernel yields , as the leading asymptotic of the spectral measure at @xmath718 , @xmath1107 where @xmath1086 is as in .",
    "the @xmath698 leading asymptotic has the same form by symmetry of the resolvent kernel .",
    "@xmath1108      we will show that the expansion of the resolvent kernel at @xmath102 is real up to the term at order @xmath1109 .",
    "an immediate consequence is a determination of the rate of vanishing of the spectral measure at @xmath102 :    [ cancellation ] the spectral measure @xmath1088 for the operator @xmath7 vanishes to order @xmath118 at @xmath102 . more particularly , it has expansion at @xmath102 of the form @xmath1110 where @xmath123 is a solution of @xmath1111 , and @xmath1112 as @xmath1113 for some smooth function @xmath255 on @xmath38 .    we first show that we may choose the parametrix @xmath724 so that its expansion at @xmath102 up to order @xmath1109 is real .",
    "this is certainly true for the pseudodifferential part of @xmath724 ; indeed , the real part of any pseudodifferential parametrix is also a pseudodifferential parametrix , since @xmath16 has real coefficients .",
    "now consider the expansion of @xmath1104 at the face @xmath102 .",
    "we see from the expansion of modified bessel functions @xmath1114 at @xmath1115 and that the imaginary part of @xmath1116 has index set @xmath1117 at @xmath102 of the form @xmath1118 where @xmath1119 and has no log terms ; in particular if @xmath139 and @xmath140 , one has @xmath1120 .",
    "similarly , we see from and that @xmath1121 and @xmath1122 have a real expansion at @xmath102 up to order @xmath1084 and their imaginary part has index set at @xmath102 of the form @xmath1123 where @xmath1124 is an index set with no log terms and @xmath1125 if @xmath139 and @xmath140 . also , @xmath1126 is real , and the higher order terms @xmath1127 , for @xmath1128 , can be chosen arbitrarily provided that they are compatible with terms specified at @xmath318 .",
    "it follows that we may choose @xmath724 so that the expansion at @xmath102 is real up to order @xmath1129 ( in the sense that @xmath1129 is the first non - real term occurring ) , actually with imaginary part having index set at @xmath102 of the form @xmath1130 where @xmath1131 has no log terms and @xmath1132 if @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we will choose @xmath724 so that its imaginary part has expansion at @xmath102 @xmath1133 for some smooth kernel @xmath878 on @xmath102 satisfying @xmath1134 , which can be done as long as the expansion matches with the imaginary parts of @xmath1135 at @xmath1136 . to determine the kernel @xmath1137 on @xmath102",
    ", we note that the eigenvalue @xmath55 for @xmath1138 is simple , and the eigenfunction does not change sign , so there is a unique positive normalized eigenfunction @xmath1139 for this eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , using melrose s b - calculus as outlined in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we then set @xmath1146 and from the expansion of , , at @xmath102 , we see that the expansion of @xmath1147 matches with the asymptotic of , , at @xmath102 . moreover , if @xmath1148 , the expansion of , , at @xmath102 involve no power of @xmath178 between @xmath1109 and @xmath1149 , therefore @xmath724 can be chosen so that @xmath1150 satisfies .",
    "since @xmath16 has real coefficients , the error term @xmath1151 has the same property as @xmath724 , i.e.it has a real expansion at @xmath102 in powers of @xmath178 up to @xmath1109 , and since @xmath1134 , the expansion at @xmath102 of @xmath1152 is actually of order @xmath1153 .",
    "we next claim that the same is true for the powers @xmath1154 . to see this , we use to show inductively that the expansion at @xmath102 is real to order @xmath1153 , since the terms at @xmath718 and @xmath698 do not affect the expansion at @xmath102 until order @xmath1155 .",
    "since @xmath35 in is given by a finite sum of the form @xmath1156 up to a term that vanishes to high order @xmath1157 at @xmath102 , the same property holds true for @xmath35 . by the same arguments",
    ", @xmath1158 has a real kernel up to order @xmath1159 .",
    "finally we show , using exactly the same method as for the powers @xmath1154 , that the composition @xmath1026 has a real expansion at @xmath102 in powers of @xmath178 up to @xmath1109 , and since @xmath1160 ( as an expansion at @xmath102 ) , we see that the resolvent @xmath1161 itself has the property that it has a real expansion at @xmath102 up to order @xmath1162 with the leading term of @xmath1163 given by ( transforming back to the original scattering metric @xmath1 ) @xmath1164 where @xmath1165 satisfies @xmath1166 , and @xmath1167 , @xmath1168 for example , if the potential function @xmath5 vanishes , then @xmath255 is constant , @xmath1169 , and @xmath1170 is just a constant function . moreover",
    "the next asymptotic term in the expansion of @xmath1163 is at order @xmath1159 .",
    "theorem  [ mainsm ] follows directly from theorem  [ mainres ] and the cancellations proved in section  [ behavdiag ] and proposition  [ cancellation ] .    using the spectral measure , we write @xmath1171 with @xmath1172 , @xmath1173 or @xmath1174",
    ". then the leading asymptotic of the kernel @xmath1175 as @xmath1176 for @xmath1177 is straightforward by using theorem [ mainth ] : the leading term @xmath1178 of @xmath1163 at @xmath127 produces the leading term in or as @xmath1176 , while the error @xmath1179 contributes at most an error term in or as @xmath1176 , by using the fact that @xmath1180 is smooth in @xmath96 and polyhomogeneous conormal at @xmath127 .",
