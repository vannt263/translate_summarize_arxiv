    "polar ice core records provide some of the most detailed views of past environmental changes up to 800000yr before present , in large part via proxy data such as the water isotopic composition and embedded chemical impurities .",
    "one of the most important features of ice cores as climate archives , is their continuity and the potential for high temporal resolution .",
    "greenland ice cores are particularly well suited for high resolution paleoclimatic studies , because relatively high snow accumulation rates allow seasonal changes in proxy data to be identified more than 50000yr in the past @xcite .",

    "one step further , the combined signal of @xmath7 and @xmath8 commonly referred to as the deuterium excess ( hereafter @xmath9 ) , constitutes a  useful paleothermometer tool . via its high correlation with the temperature of the evaporation source @xcite",

    "a  relatively recent advance in the use of water isotope ratios as a  direct proxy of firn temperatures , has been introduced by @xcite .",
    "assessment of the diffusivity of the water isotopologues in the porous medium of the firn column can yield a  temperature history , provided a  dating model is available .",
    "the measurement of water stable isotopic composition is typically performed off - line via discrete sampling with traditional isotope ratio mass spectrometry ( hereafter irms ) . while high precision and accuracy can routinely be achieved with irms systems , water isotope analysis remains an elaborate process , which is demanding in terms of sample preparation , power consumption , sample size , consumables , isotope standards and carrier gases .",
    "the analysis of a  deep ice core at its full length in high resolution ( typically 2.5 to 5 cm per sample ) requires the processing of a  vast amount of water samples and can take years to complete .",
    "additionally , these procedures often come at the expense of not fully exploiting the temporal resolution available in the ice core .",
    "laser spectroscopy in the near and mid infrared region has been demonstrated as a  potential alternative for water isotope analysis , presenting numerous advantages over irms @xcite .",
    "a  major advantage of the technique is the ability to directly inject the sampled water vapour in the optical cavity of the spectrometer where both isotopic ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 are measured simultaneuously .",
    "in contrast , in the most common irms techniques water is not measured as such , but has to be converted to a  different gas prior to measurement . for @xmath8 analysis ,",
    "the @xmath12 equilibration method @xcite has been widely used , whereas @xmath7 analysis commonly involves the reduction of water to hydrogen gas over hot uranium @xcite , or chromium @xcite . however , the combined use of these two methods rules out simultaneous analysis of both water isotopologues on a  given sample .",
    "more recently , in combination with the use of continuous flow mass spectrometers , conversion of water to @xmath13 and @xmath14 is performed in a  pyrolysis furnice @xcite and allows simultaneous @xmath7 and @xmath8 measurement , but still on a  single discrete sample .",

    "these units typically receive a  continuous stream of water vapor and offer ease of use and portability .",
    "the analysis of another set of ice core proxies , that of chemical impurities , has similarly been an elaborate process , traditionally performed with liquid techniques . with the advent of continuous flow analysis ( heareafter cfa ) from continuously melted ice core segments , the measurement of chemical impurities has reached the point of largely exploiting the high resolution available in the core while it is often performed in the field @xcite .",
    "the continuous , on - line nature of the technique has resulted in a  considerable reduction in sample preparation and processing times .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated the measurement of @xmath19 mixing ratios in an on - line semi continuous mode with the use of a  gas chromatograph combined with a  pulsed discharge and a  thermal conductivity detector .    here",
    ", we demonstrate the ability to perform continuous measurements of water isotope ratios from a  stream of water vapor derived from a  continuously melting ice rod by coupling a  commercial ir spectrometer to a  cfa system via a  passive , low volume flash evaporation module . in the following ,",
    "we assess the system s precision , accuracy , and efficient calibration .",
    "we then comment on issues related to sample dispersion in the sample transfer lines , the evaporation module and the optical cavity of the spectrometer itself in order to determine the expected smoothing imposed on the acquired data sets .",
    "finally , isotopic analysis of ice core samples from the neem deep ice core are presented and compared to measurements performed in discrete mode .",
    "in the system described here , ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) an ice rod measuring 3.2@xmath203.2@xmath20110 cm ( hereafter cfa run ) is continuously melted on a  copper , gold - nickel coated melter at a  regulated temperature of 20@xmath3c .",
    "the concentric arrangement of the melter s surface facilitates the separation of the sample that originates from the outer and inner part of the core .",
    "approximately 90% of the sample from the inner part is transfered to the analytical system by means of a  peristaltic pump with a  flow rate of 16mlmin@xmath21 .",
    "this configuration provides an overflow of @xmath2210% from the inner to the outer part of the melter and ensures that the water sample that is introduced into the analytical system is not contaminated .",
    "a  stainless steel weight sitting on top of the ice rod enhances the stability and continuity of the melting process .",
    "an optical encoder connected to the stainless steel weight , records the displacement of the rod .",
    "this information is used to accurately define the depth scale of the produced water isotope data .",
    "breaks in the ice rod are logged prior to the melting process and accounted for , during the data analysis procedure .",
    "gases included in the water stream originating from the air bubbles in the ice core are extracted in a  sealed debubbler , with a  volume of @xmath22300@xmath23l .",
    "the melt rate of the present system is approximately 3.2cmmin@xmath21 , thus resulting in an analysis time of @xmath2235min per cfa run . during the intervals between cfa runs , mq and a total organic content less than 10ppb .",

    "the setpoint of the evaporation temperature is set to 170@xmath3c and is regulated with a  pid controller .",
    "the amount of the injected water to the oven can be adjusted by the pressure gradient maintained between the inlet and waste ports of the t1 tee - split ( fig .",

    "for a  detailed description of the sample preparation and evaporation module the reader may reffer to @xcite . a  smooth and undisturbed sample delivery to the spectrometer at the level of @xmath2220000ppm results in optimum performance of the system .",
    "fluctuations of the sample flow caused by air bubbles or impurities are likely to result in a  deteriorated performance of the measurement and are occasionally observed as extreme outliers on both @xmath8 and @xmath7 measurements . the processes that control the occurence of these events are still not well understood .",
    "in this study we present data collected in the framework of the neem ice core drilling project .",

    "the diffusivity coefficients of these two processes differ by 4  orders of magnitude @xcite .    assuming an isotopic signal @xmath44 for the precipitation , the total effect of the diffusive processes , in - situ and experimental , can be seen as the convolution of @xmath45 with a  smoothing filter @xmath46 .",

    "since instrumental and in - situ firn - ice diffusion are statistically independent , the variance of the total smoothing filter is the sum of the variances of the in - situ and experimental smoothing filters ( hereafter @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "@xmath54it can be seen that any attempt to study firn and ice diffusion by means of ice core data obtained with an on - line method similar to the one we present here , requires a  good assesment of the diffusive properties of the experimental system .",

    "one way to approach this problem is to measure the response of the system to a  step function .",

    "[ summary and conclusions ]    we have succesfully demonstrated the possibility for on - line water isotopic analysis on a  continuously melted ice core sample . we used an infrared laser spectrometer in a  cavity ring down configuration in combination with a  continuous flow melter system .",
    "a  custom made continuous stream flash evaporator served as the sample preparation unit , interfacing the laser spectrometer to the melter system .",
    "local water standards have been used in order to calibrate the measurements to the vsmow scale .",
    "additionally , dependencies related to the sample size in the optical cavity have been accounted for .",
    "the melting procedure is recorded by an optical encoder that provides the necessary information for assigning a  depth scale to the isotope measurements .",
    "we verified the validity of the applied calibrations and the calculated depth scale by comparing the cfa measurements with measurements performed on discrete samples in 5 cm resolution .    by means of spectral methods",
    "we provide an estimate of the noise level of the measurements .",
    "the uncertainty of the measurement is estimated at @xmath220.06 , 0.2 , and 0.5 for @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "this performance is comparable to , or better than the performance typically achieved with conventional irms systems in a  discrete mode .",
    "based on the isotopic step at the beginning of each cfa run , the impulse response , as well as the transfer function of the system can be estimated .",
    "we show how this method does not take into account the whole cfa system , thus underestimating the sample diffusion that takes place from the melter until the optical cavity of the spectrometer .",
    "we proposed a  different method that considers the power spectrum of the cfa data in combination with the spectrum of a  data set over the same depth interval measured in a  discrete off - line fashion .",
    "the use of the optimal filtering deconvolution technique , provides a  way to deconvolute the measured isotopic profiles for apparent sample dispersion effects .",
    "the combination of infrared spectroscopy on gaseuous samples with continuous flow melter systems provides new possibilities for ice core science.the non destructive , continuous , and on - line technique offers the possibility for analysis of multiple species on the same sample in high resolution and precision and can potentially be performed in the eld .",
