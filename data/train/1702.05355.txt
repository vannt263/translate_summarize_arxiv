    "until now , mean - field - type game theory was not focused on cognitively - plausible models of choices in humans , animals , machines , robots , software - defined and mobile devices strategic interactions .",
    "this paper studies behavioral and psychological games of mean - field type .",
    "psychological games seems to explain behaviors that are better captured in experiments or in practice than classical game - theoretic equilibrium analysis .",
    "it takes in consideration psychological patterns of the decision - makers in addition to the traditional  material \" payoff modelling .",
    "the payoff value depends upon choice consequences , mean - field states , mean - field actions and on beliefs about what will happen .",
    "the psychological game theory framework can link cognition , emotion , and express emotions , guilt , empathy , altruism , spitefulness ( maliciousness ) of the decision - makers .",
    "it also include belief - dependent and other - regarding preferences in the motivations .",
    "one motivating example of psychological game theory is trying to understand how her users and consumers will perceive a product or are thinking about a product in web online shop and will engage in empathy in the interaction .",
    "there are several definitions of empathy in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "cognitive empathy of a player , sometimes also called perspective taking , is the ability to identify the felling and emotions of other players . perspective",
    "taking empathy is considered as the experience of understanding another player s state and actions from their perspective or mutual perspective via several channels .",
    "a decision - maker can place herself in the shoes of the others and feel what they are feeling .",
    "this is a particularly useful concept in the context of psychological game theory .",
    "indeed , it helps to anticipate , compute and to react to the behavior of the others thanks to empathy .",
    "note that , empathy is different than sympathy which is the ability to select appropriate emotional responses for the apparent emotional states of others .",
    "in other words , sympathy is not about feeling the same thing that somebody else is feeling , but an appropriate emotion to complement theirs .",
    "another notion is compassion which heuristically is to treat others as you would like to be treated .",
    "it consists in selecting the appropriate action in response to the apparent emotional states of another .",
    "this active version of empathy may result in partial altruism in the preferences formation of the players . in game theory , the strategy and",
    "the resulting actions play key roles in the outcomes .",
    "a player may use empathy in different ways .",
    "examples include empathy - selfishness , empathy - altruism and empathy - spitefulness . in this work ,",
    "we examine basic empathy subscales : perspective taking ( pt ) , empathy concern ( ec ) , fantasy scale ( fs ) and personal distress ( pd ) that will be evaluated through the interpersonal reactivity index ( iri , @xcite ) .",
    "we overview some prior works on empathy in game theory .",
    "the motivation of decision makers who care for various emotions , intentions - based reciprocity , or the opinions of others may depend directly on beliefs ( about choices , states , behaviors , or information ) .",
    "the study in @xcite tries to explain how we can understand what someone else feels when he or she experiences simple emotions .",
    "some psychological factors are considered in a game theoretic context @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite investigates the neural basis of complex decision making using a game theory .",
    "the authors of @xcite study neuroeconomics approach to decision - making by combining game theory with psychological and neuroscientific methods .",
    "the work in @xcite underlined how empathy leads to fairness and @xcite studied the correlation between empathy , anticipated guilt and prosocial behaviour ; in his study he found out that empathy affects prosocial behaviour in a more complex way than the one represented by the classical model of social choices .",
    "the authors in @xcite propose and synthesize a large body of experimental and theoretical analysis on multi - agent interactions , in psychology as well as economics .",
    "the work in @xcite presents a game theoretic approach to empathy , reporting on current knowledge of the evolutionary , social , developmental , cognitive , and neurobiological aspects of empathy and linking this capacity to human communication , including in clinical practice and medical education . under mild conditions",
    ", @xcite shows that such empathetic preferences requiring us to see things from another s point of view can be summarized by empathic payoff function .",
    "the idea of empathic preferences was followed in @xcite where the importance of empathic payoff function is illustrated .",
    "the work in @xcite presents an overview on empathy and mind reading in some detail and have pointed out other - regarding preferences in game theory . in the classical approach , they are taken to be , in the worst case , a purely selfish or , in the best case , self- regarding individuals . in the psychological payoffs",
    ", players may care about the betterment of others as well as themselves but their position , state or consumption is simply another argument of their own preferences .",
    "other - regarding preferences are sometimes presented not simply as being concerned with the payoff of specific others , but may incorporate more general concerns , such as equity , risk and fairness .",
    "the problem of comparing the payoff of different players is vital for the question of fairness and equity @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite proposes an evolutionary game - theoretic approach to study the evolutionary effect of empathy on cooperative games .",
    "the origin , the source and learnability of empathy remains open .",
    "the evolution of empathy and its connection to reciprocal altruism are discussed in @xcite .",
    "building on dynamic interactive epistemology , @xcite proposes a more general framework that includes higher - order beliefs , beliefs of others , and plans of action may influence motivation , dynamic psychological patterns ( such as sequential reciprocity , psychological forward induction , and regret ) .",
    "these preliminary studies enrich classical game theory by empirical knowledge and makes it significantly closer to what is needed for real - world applications .",
    "thousands of theoretical papers have been published about the prisoner s dilemma game and more than 30 experiments about have been conducted in the literature , only few of them are dedicated to the emergence of cooperative behaviors in one - shot games @xcite .",
    "the works in @xcite consider decision - making problems .",
    "however , the effect of users psychology on its decision is not examined in these previous works .",
    "none of these previous works considered a mean - field - type game setup .",
    "finally , the range of applications covered by these papers is limited compared to the current work .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine the effect of empathy on players behavior and outcomes in mean - field - type game theory .",
    "the psychology of the players is analyzed in several engineering applications .",
    "our contribution can be summarized as follows .",
    "this paper illustrates how some insights from the psychology literature on empathy can be incorporated into a mean - field - type payoff function , and demonstrate the potential interaction of beliefs , strategies , mean - field through the channel of empathy .",
    "it establishes mean - field equilibrium systems with psychological payoffs .",
    "* empathy as perspective taking may induce a partial altruism . to a partially altruistic player we would be considering a payoff in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 + it is shown that empathy - altruism promotes fairness in terms of mean - field equilibrium payoffs in wide range of mean - field - type games .",
    "we illustrate empathy concepts in several important engineering problems . *",
    "* we provide an experimental evidence that the degree of empathy can shift the decisional balance in a one - shot forwarding dilemma game . to this end",
    ", we have conducted an experimental test with 47 people carrying mobile devices .",
    "we have developed a android app called empathizer to measure dimensional empathy of the participant ( fig.[fig : empathizer ] ) .",
    "it turns out that empathy induces some cooperative behaviors which consist to forward the data of the other wireless nodes in a network .",
    "applied to d2d communications and wifi direct technology , this experiment helps us to estimate the proportion of users who are potentially interesting in enabling their platform to the others .",
    "the same method can be useful in other contexts such as mobile crowd sensing which pertains to the monitoring of large - scale phenomena that can not be easily measured by a single individual user . for example",
    ", intelligent transportation systems may require traffic congestion monitoring and air pollution level monitoring .",
    "these phenomena can be measured accurately only when many individuals provide speed and air quality information from their daily commutes , which are then aggregated spatio - temporally to determine congestion and pollution levels in smart cities .",
    "it is thus important to estimate the number of potential participants who decide their level of participation to the crowdsensing when these users are carrying power - hungry devices to serve the cloud data .",
    "+     * * empathy - altruism provides a better explanation of resource sharing outcomes . * * the empathy - altruism of the users may help in reducing packets collision in wireless medium access channel and hence reducing congestion . *",
    "* empathy - altruism reduces energy consumption during peak hours . *",
    "* empathy - altruism of prosumers improves their equilibrium revenues . *",
    "can empathy at times be harmful ?",
    "+ we do not restrict ourselves to the positive part of empathy .",
    "empathy may have a dark or at least costly side specially when the environment is strategic and interactive as it is the case in games .",
    "+ can empathy be bad for the self ?",
    "empathy can be used , for example , by a other player attacker to identify the weak nodes in the network .",
    "+ can empathy be bad for others ?",
    "empathetic users may use their ability to destroy the opponents . in strategic interaction between people",
    ", empathy may be used to derive antipathetic response ( distress at seeing others pleasure , or pleasure at seeing others distress ) .",
    "+ we illustrate this in a context of auction in prosumer ( consumer - producer ) markets .",
    "a prosumer who is bidder might be losing the auction due highly competitive prices .",
    "yet she participates in the auction because she wants to minimize the negative payoff on losing by making her competitor , who would win the auction , gets low reward by selling its energy at almost zero price or negative price and hence the other get a high price for the win .",
    "this negative dependence of payoff on others surplus is referred to as spiteful behavior .",
    "we associate a certain spitefulness coefficient @xmath2 to the bidder @xmath3 a spiteful player @xmath4 maximizes the weighted difference of her own profit @xmath5 and his competitors profits @xmath6 for all @xmath7 the payoff of a spiteful ( antipathetic ) player is @xmath8 obviously , setting @xmath9 and @xmath10 yields a selfishness ( whose payoff equals his exact profit ) whereas @xmath11 defines a malicious player ( jammer ) whose only goal is to minimize the global profit of other players . for @xmath12 we can scale the payoff by @xmath13 to get @xmath14,$ ] which is equivalent to focusing on @xmath15 where @xmath16 this class of games captures a very extreme scenario in which everyone dislikes all the others .",
    "it is shown that the empathy - spitefulness of prosumers decreases the optimal bidding price of the winners .",
    "this means that the spitefulness of the prosumers may benefit to the consumers .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : motivation ]",
    "we provide motivating examples illustrating how empathy - altruism improves fairness .",
