    "the experimental program at jefferson lab focuses on the studies of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons and nuclei , in particular in a region where a transition is expected from a nucleon - meson description into a quark - gluon description of matter . in experimental hall",
    "c the emphasis has been on inclusive ( e , e@xmath3 ) electron scattering and proton knockout ( e , e@xmath3p ) experiments at the highest four - momentum transfer ( @xmath4 ) accessible , deuteron photodisintegration experiments , and both exclusive and semi - inclusive pion electroproduction reactions . in particular , the hall c experimental program has studied the onset of the quark - parton model description of such reactions .",
    "to accomplish such a diverse program , a highly flexible set of instruments capable of accurate measurements of final momenta and angles is required , including both efficient background rejection and good particle identification properties .",
    "this remains very much in place after the 12-gev upgrade of jefferson lab ( jlab ) has been completed , with hall c emphasizing precision measurements at high luminosities , with detection of high - energy reaction products approaching the beam energy at very forward angles .",
    "the initial base equipment of hall c was well suited to the jlab scientific program that required high luminosity , intermediate detector acceptances and resolution @xcite . with the high luminosities needed to access neutrino - like",
    "scattering probabilities comes a high - background suppression requirement .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer pair that constituted the base equipment pointed to a common pivot with scattering chamber .",
    "the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) , with a qdd configuration , accessed a momentum range of 0.3 - 1.7 gev / c , and an angular range of @xmath5 - @xmath6 .",
    "it was explicitly designed to measure pions and kaons with short life times . the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) , with a qqqd magnetic configuration , covered a momentum range 0.5 - 7.3 gev / c , but was to date not used above 5.7 gev / c .",
    "the hms accessed an angular range between @xmath7 - @xmath8 .",
    "after the jlab 12-gev upgrade @xcite , the hall c scientific program is again focused on high luminosity measurements with detection of high energy reaction products at small forward angles .",
    "such a physics program can be accessed only by a spectrometer system providing high acceptance for , given the larger boosts associated with the energy upgrade , very forward - going particles , and analyzing power for particle momenta approaching that of the incoming beam . to accomplish this , and maintain a spectrometer pair rotating around a common pivot for precision coincidence measurements",
    ", the sos will be superseded by the newly built super high momentum spectrometer ( shms ) .",
    "the shms will achieve a minimum ( maximum ) scattering angle of 5.5@xmath9 ( 40@xmath9 ) with acceptable solid angle and do so at high luminosity .",
    "the maximum momentum will be 11 gev / c , well matched to the maximum energy available in hall c. the basic parameters of the hms , sos and shms are listed in table  [ hms - shms - param ] .",

    "the calibration algorithm used in these studies is the same as for the hms calorimeter ( see subsection  [ calo_calibr ] ) : the variation of total energy deposition in preshower and shower relative to the energy of the primary electron is minimized with respect to the calibration constants for each signal channel .",

    "= 3.40 in = 2.40 in    examination of the functional forms of energy dependencies of the two resolutions shows that the difference comes mainly from the stochastic term : compare 5.04@xmath10 for the shms with 3.75@xmath10 for the hms .",
    "the stochastic term is sensitive to dead material before detector and to photoelectron statistics  @xcite , which is in turn sensitive to the quality of radiator and light detectors .",
    "both of these conditions are less favorable for the shms counter : there is more material between the focal plane and the calorimeter in the shms than in the hms @xmath110.38 versus @xmath120.16 radiation lengths respectively ; and the lead - glass in shms calorimeter is less transparent than in the hms calorimeter .",
    "the latter , combined with larger sizes , noticeably reduces photoelectron statistics in the shms calorimeter .",

    "the separation boundaries are tuned to the same electron detection efficiencies as in the first case , and are optimized for minimum error rate by means of svm@xmath16 neural network  @xcite .",
    "details can be found in a similar case with hms calorimeter  @xcite , where the forward layer of the counter was used as preshower . there , for the pid with combined energy depositions , from comparison with experimental data it was found that the simulation overestimates pion suppression , by @xmath1270% at low electron detection efficiencies @xmath1790% , and @xmath1240% at high efficiencies @xmath1299.7% .    as it is seen in fig .",
