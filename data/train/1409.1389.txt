    "the top quark as a heaviest elementary particle , is the electroweak isospin partner of the bottom quark . since its discovery by the cdf and @xmath3 experiments at fermilab tevatron@xcite",
    ", the determination of its properties has been one of the main goals of the tevatron collider , recently joined by the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the experiments at the lhc will allow one to perform improved measurements of the top properties , such as its mass @xmath4 and branching fractions to high accuracy .",
    "the measurement of the top mass , as a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) , has received particular attention .",
    "indeed , the mass of top , the @xmath5-boson mass , and the higgs boson mass are related through radiative corrections that provide an internal consistency check of the sm . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "the mass of the top quark is measured as @xmath6 gev , by using the full sample of @xmath7 collision data collected by the @xmath3 experiment in run ii of the fermilab tevatron collider at @xmath8 tev .",
    "the theoretical aspects of top quark physics at the lhc are listed in @xcite .",
    "+ the sm result of the top quark life time is @xmath9 s @xcite which is much shorter than the typical time for the formation of qcd bound states @xmath10 s , i.e. the top quark decays so rapidly that it does not have enough time to hadronize . due to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix element @xmath11 @xcite ,",
    "the decay width of the top quark is dominated by the two - body channel @xmath1 in the minimal sm of particle physics . at the top mass scale the strong coupling",
    "constant is small , @xmath12 , so that the qcd effects involving the top quark are well behaved in the perturbative sense .",
    "this allows one to apply the top quark decay as an appropriate tool for studying perturbative qcd and thus top decays provide a very clean source of information about the structure of the sm .",
    "+ on the other hand , bottom quarks produced in the top decays hadronize before they decay and the bottom hadronization ( @xmath13 ) is indeed one of the sources of uncertainty in the measurement of the top mass at the lhc @xcite and the tevatron @xcite , as it contributes to the monte carlo systematics . at the lhc",
    ", recent studies @xcite have suggested that final states with leptons , coming from the @xmath14 decay ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 , coming from the decay of a bottom - flavored meson ( b ) , would be a promising channel to reconstruct the top mass . at the lhc , of particular interest",
    "is the distribution in the scaled - energy of b - meson ( @xmath17 ) in the top quark rest frame as reliably as possible , so that this @xmath17 distribution provides direct access to the b - hadron fragmentation functions ( ffs ) . in @xcite , in addition to the @xmath17 distribution , we also studied the doubly differential partial width @xmath18 of the decay chain @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the decay angle of the lepton in the w - boson rest frame .",
    "the @xmath21 distribution allows one to analyze the @xmath14-boson polarization and so to further constrain the b - meson ffs . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the qcd nlo corrections to the energy distribution of b - mesons from the decay of an unpolarized top quark into a stable charged - higgs boson , @xmath22 , in the theories beyond - the - sm with an extended higgs sector .",
    "although , in @xcite it is mentioned that there is a clear separation between the decays @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the lhc , in both the @xmath25 pair production and the @xmath26 single top production .",
    "the interplay between the top mass and its spin is of crucial importance in studying the sm . due to the top large mass",
    ", the top quark decays rapidly so that its life time scale is much shorter than the typical time required for the qcd interactions to randomize its spin , therefore its full spin information is preserved in the decay and passes on to its decay products .",
    "hence , the top quark polarization can be studied through the angular correlations between the direction of the top quark spin and the momenta of the decay products .",
    "therefore , the particular purpose of this paper is to evaluate the qcd nlo corrections to the energy distribution of b - hadrons from the decay of a polarized top quark into a bottom quark , via @xmath27 .",
    "we mention that highly polarized top quarks will become available at hadron colliders through single top production processes , which occur at the @xmath28 level of the @xmath29 pair production rate @xcite , and in top quark pairs produced in future linear @xmath30-colliders @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the angular distribution of the scaled - energy of the b / d - hadrons at nlo by calculating the polar angular correlation in the rest frame decay of a polarized top quark into a stable @xmath14-boson and b / d - hadrons , via @xmath31 .",
    "we analyzed this angular correlation in a special helicity coordinate system with the event plane defined in the @xmath32 plane and the z - axes along the b - quark momentum . in this frame ( system  1 ) ,",
    "the top quark polarization vector was evaluated with respect to the direction of the b - quark momentum . generally , to define the planes one needs to measure the momentum directions of the momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the polarization direction of the top quark , where the measurement of the momentum direction of @xmath33 requires the use of a jet finding algorithm , whereas the polarization direction of the top quark must be obtained from the theoretical input . in electron - positron interactions",
    "the polarization degree of the top quark can be tuned with the help of polarized beams @xcite , so that a polarized linear electron - positron collider may be viewed as a copious source of close to zero and close to @xmath35 polarized top quarks .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the angular distribution of the b - hadron energy in a different helicity coordinate system where , as before , the event plane is the @xmath32 plane but with the z - axes along the @xmath14-boson .",
    "the polarization direction of the top quark is evaluated w.r.t this axes .",
    "this coordinate system ( system  2 ) makes the calculations more complicated because of the presence of the @xmath14-momentum @xmath36 in the @xmath0 real amplitude of the process @xmath1 . to obtain the scaled distribution of b - hadron energy , at first we present an analytical expression for the nlo corrections to the differential width of the decay process @xmath37 in two different helicity coordinate systems and then using the realistic and nonperturbative @xmath38 ff we shall present and compare our results in both systems .",
    "the measurement of the energy distribution of the b - hadron will be important to deepen our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of b - hadrons formation and to test the universality and scaling violations of the b - hadron ffs while the angular analysis of the polarized top decay constrain these ffs even further .",

    "<S> we calculate the @xmath0 radiative corrections to the spin dependent differential decay rates of the process @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these are needed to study the angular distribution of the energy of hadrons produced in polarized top quark decays at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . in our previous work , we studied the angular distribution of the scaled - energy of bottom - flavored hadrons ( b ) from polarized top quark decays , using a specific helicity coordinate system where the top quark spin was measured relative to the bottom momentum ( system  1 ) . here , we study the angular distribution of the energy spectrum of b - hadron in a different helicity system , where the top spin is specified relative to the w - momentum ( system  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these energy distributions are governed by the polarized and unpolarized rate functions which are related to the density matrix elements of the decay @xmath2 . through this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present our predictions of the b - hadron spectrum in the polarized and unpolarized top decay and shall compare the polarized results in two different helicity systems . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions can be used to determine the polarization states of top quarks and also provide direct access to the b - hadron fragmentation functions ( ffs ) and allow us to deepen our knowledge of the hadroniazation process . </S>"
