    "to describe the complex behavior of disordered systems without using gaussian approximation , the stochastic processes , called lvy flights , are commonly utilized @xcite .",
    "the stochastic trajectories of lvy flights alternate between some continuous motions and jumps ( sometimes extremely long ) and hence do not obey gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "the length of these jumps obeys to so - called lvy stable distributions with a power - law tails , which decay much slower then gaussian ones .",
    "this yields the divergence of already second moment of such distributions .",
    "contrary to ordinary diffusion , described by gaussian distributions , the above jump - type discontinuous motions are commonly attributed as anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "it turns out that lvy stable distributions and lvy flights are relevant to many physical @xcite , chemical , biological @xcite and socio - economic @xcite systems .",
    "prominent physical examples are subrecoil laser cooling of trapped atoms @xcite , energy exchange in landau - teller model of molecular collisions @xcite and so - called multifractality of the wave functions in the disordered quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it is well - known , that the concentration @xmath2 of particles performing lvy flights satisfies in its simplest form a diffusion equation where the laplacian operator is replaced by a fractional derivative @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( lvy index @xmath5 ) is a fractional laplacian of order @xmath6 , restricted to 1d case @xcite so that at @xmath7 we recover the ordinary laplace operator @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of this operator reads @xmath8 which shows that this operator is spatially nonlocal , becoming an issue if confronted with a priori imposed boundary conditions .",
    "this is irrespective of whether we are interested in lvy processes with absorption ( killing ) at the boundaries , or in so - called fractional quantum mechanics .",
    "namely , at the unbounded domains , the fractional laplacian is most easily defined by its fourier transform @xmath9 while on bounded domains @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a real axis ) the fourier transform is no longer operational @xcite , see specifically @xcite .",
    "transformation permits to solve many problems related to fractional diffusion and fractional quantum mechanics in @xmath12 space on unbounded domains @xcite , while on the bounded ones this method fails , making problem nontrivial .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the lvy flights of arbitrary index @xmath0 confinement by the infinite potential well , which arises naturally in the context of so - called first - passage problems @xcite .",
    "we show that this problem is equivalent to that of fractional quantum mechanics of a particle in a potential well of infinite depth @xcite .",
    "we solve this problem by further reducing the corresponding fractional schrdinger equation to the fredholm integral equation with hypersingular kernel .",
    "the latter equation has been solved with arbitrary accuracy ( for eigenstates and eigenfunctions ) by the expansion over the ( infinite ) complete set of orthogonal functions , which in the case of above potential well are trigonometric functions .",
    "this expansion is suitable for any lvy index @xmath0 , although many results are obtained for so - called ultrarelativistic or cauchy case @xmath13 .",
    "this case corresponds to zero mass ( @xmath14 ) case of the relativistic hamiltonian @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the velocity of light , @xmath17 is ordinary laplacian ) and thus is physically sound @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "note also purely mathematical literature @xcite in the context of the case @xmath13 .",
    "we show , that our algorithm , consisting in the expansion of the solution over the suitable set of orthogonal functions , permits to attack successfully virtually any problem of so - called fractional quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider the fractional schrdinger equation @xmath18\\psi(x)=e \\psi ( x)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 \\\\ \\infty , \\quad { \\rm { otherwise } } , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath20 for @xmath21 and defines the infinitely high `` walls '' of the potential well in the points @xmath22 . now",
    ", the whole real axis @xmath11 can be divided into the regions inside @xmath23 and outside well to get : @xmath24\\frac{\\psi(u)-\\psi(x)}{|u - x|^{1+\\mu}}du.\\label{fr1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the symbolic integration signs in the square brackets in mean the sum of corresponding integrals .",
    "now we make note of the fact that for regions outside the well @xmath25 so that we have @xmath26\\frac{du}{|u - x|^{1+\\mu}}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be shown that with respect to definition of modulus ( @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 if @xmath30 ) and above division of real axis @xmath11 into three subintervals , the integral @xmath31 is defined by the values of antiderivative at infinities .",
    "these values are zero except the case @xmath32 , where they are logarithmically divergent .",
    "this yields @xmath33 for @xmath0 so that the desired integral equation acquires the form @xmath34 the equation is the fredholm integral equation , which we are going to solve below .",
    "we will show that at @xmath7 our solution recovers the case of the infinite potential well with ordinary laplacian @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath13 the integral in refers to the so - called hadamard finite part of singular integrals , extensively employed in the works of crack propagation in solids @xcite .",
    "note also that the spectral problem is the homogeneous fredholm equation with a hypersingular symmetric kernel @xmath35 . if the kernel of eq .",
    "is nonsingular ( i.e. such that @xmath36 ) , then this equation obeys so - called fredholm alternative @xcite : either @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) is its eigenvalue and @xmath39 is eigenfunction or the equation has a trivial solution @xmath40 . also , for nonsingular kernel",
    ", the number of eigenstates is discreet and finite @xcite and exactly for the equation with nonsingular kernel its eigenfunctions are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , i.e. they correspond to the case of infinite well in ordinary quantum mechanics @xcite . on the other hand , for the case of singular kernels , the solution of the spectral problem ( if in existence ) has an infinite ( although discreet ) number of eigenstates @xcite .",
    "one more remark is in place here .",
    "as we will see below , the best way to solve the integral equation is to expand its solution over the complete set of orthogonal functions . in our view",
    ", the best choice of such set is the eigenfunctions of the corresponding ordinary ( i.e. that with ordinary laplacian ) quantum mechanics . in other words",
    ", we can claim , that the fractional derivative in corresponding quantum mechanical problem `` mixes '' all the eigenstates of that with ordinary laplacian .",
    "this means , for instance , that even ground state wave function for @xmath43 is indeed an infinite superposition of the functions , corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "below we are going to realize this algorithm .",
    "now we are going to solve the integral equation , i.e. to deduce the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the nonlocal operator @xmath44 . as we have mentioned above @xcite , there are no systematic methods ( even numerical ) of solution of integral equations with singular ( or hypersingular ) kernels . along the lines of above scenario , below we suggest an effective algorithm of such solution , based on the `` mixture '' of the quantum states of the infinite potential well with ordinary laplacian , i.e. that for @xmath7 .",
    "more presicely , we are looking for the solution as an expansion over the appropriate complete set of orthogonal functions , which in our case turn out to be trigonometric fourier series .",
    "our algorithm permits to obtain the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the problem with arbitrary accuracy by reducing it to the eigenproblem of the infinite matrix .",
    "our method permits also to obtain approximate analytical expressions for eigenvalues and several first eigenfunctions .",
    "our algorithm is based on the following assumptions :    \\1 . based on standard quantum mechanical infinite well experience @xcite and previous attempts to solve the lvy - stable infinite well problem @xcite and @xcite we can safely classify eigenfunctions to be odd or even .",
    "the oscillation theorem @xcite appears to be valid here so that the ground state wave function has no nodes ( intersections with @xmath45 axis ) , first excited state has one node , second one has two nodes etc .",
    "so , our even states can be labeled by quantum numbers @xmath46 0,2,4,6 , ... while odd states by @xmath461,3,5 , ....    \\2 .",
    "similar to ordinary quantum mechanics @xcite , the hilbert space of the system can be interpreted as a direct sum of odd and even subspaces , equipped with corresponding orthonormal sets of functions in the interval [ -1,1 ] .    \\3 . as the complete set of eigenfunctions of the ordinary ( @xmath7 ) infinite well @xcite consists of standard trigonometric functions",
    ", we will look for the eigenfunctions of the problem in the form of trigonometric series .",
    "the even basis system in @xmath47 is composed of cosines @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the kronecker delta .",
    "for the odd basis system we take the sines @xmath50    \\5 .",
    "we look for eigenfunctions of @xmath51 separately in odd and even hilbert subspaces of @xmath47 .    presuming that the fourier ( trigonometric ) series converge , for even functions we have @xmath52 while for odd functions @xmath53 to avoid confusion , we point out that the standard numbering of overall infinite well eigenfunctions begins with @xmath54 rather then from @xmath55 ( even case ) or @xmath56 ( odd case ) as we have assumed above . we need to have a clear discrimination between sine ( odd ) and cosine ( even ) fourier series expansions .",
    "the final outcomes will be re - labeled in terms of consecutive integers @xmath57 .      in this case",
    "we substitute the function @xmath58 into to obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 it can be shown that the integrals are convergent for any @xmath61 .",
    "they can be exactly reduced to the form , which does not contain removable divergences @xmath62\\biggr\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\lambda_k=\\frac{\\pi}{2}(2k+1),\\ \\lambda_{k\\pm}=   \\lambda_k(1\\pm x).\\label{so4b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the integrals in square brackets of are convergent at @xmath63 for all @xmath64 ( we have integrable feature like @xmath65 ) , while the divergence at @xmath7 is compensated by zero of @xmath66 .",
    "the expression permits to represent functions @xmath67 at @xmath13 through sine si@xmath68 and cosine ci@xmath68 integral functions @xcite @xmath69 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\cos \\lambda_kx\\bigl[{\\rm{si}}\\ \\lambda_{k-}+ { \\rm{si}}\\ \\lambda_{k+}\\bigr ] \\biggr\\},\\label{so6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that some integrals in expression as well as the functions ci@xmath70 are singular at @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this singularity turns out to be removable by subsequent integration with @xmath72 so that the resulting matrix elements are finite , see below .",
    "now we multiply both sides of the equation by @xmath73 and integrate from @xmath74 to @xmath75 with respect to the orthonormality of @xmath73 .",
    "the equation is now replaced by an ( infinite ) matrix eigenvalue problem @xmath76 whose approximate solution can be done considering successive eigenvalue problems for finite @xmath77 matrices .",
    "note that the expressions for diagonal matrix elements @xmath78 give already good approximation for corresponding eigenvalues , especially for large @xmath79 .",
    "the set is a linear homogeneous system , which , according to kronecker - capelli theorem , has a nontrivial solution only if its determinant equals zero .",
    "this permits to determine the eigenvalues @xmath80 and the coefficients @xmath81 of the expansion as the eigenvectors , corresponding to each @xmath80 .",
    "we calculate the integrals @xmath82 numerically , but it turns out that some of them ( for instance the diagonal elements @xmath83 at @xmath13 ) can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath84 and @xmath73 show that the matrix is symmetric , i.e. @xmath85 @xmath86 , which means that eigenvalues are real .",
    "we have for diagonal elements at @xmath13 @xmath87,\\ ] ] while for couple of first non - diagonal elements",
    "@xmath88 : @xmath89 where for clarity we suppress first index @xmath13 .    the explicit form of the matrix reads ( for each @xmath90",
    "; we once more suppress this index ) @xmath91 to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors we use iterative procedure , considering partial matrices @xmath92",
    ", @xmath93 etc .",
    "the eigenvalues of the simplest partial matrix @xmath92 give the lowest order approximation of ground state and _ second _ excited state @xmath94 .",
    "the equation for associated eigenvalues reads : @xmath95 the analytical expressions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be obtained by means of analytical formulas for @xmath98 , .",
    "although computations are cumbersome , one arrives at a reasonable ( albeit still far form being sharp ) approximation to eigenvalues associated with the ground state and second ( or first even ) excited state . using numerical values of @xmath99",
    ", we calculate for @xmath13 @xmath100 where @xmath101 are eigenvectors , corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in other words , the approximate ( crude , low order )",
    "shapes of the eigenfunctions read @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 correspond to ground and second excited state .",
    "we note here that the reproduced eigenvectors are @xmath47 normalized , while an overall sign may be negative .",
    "latter is not important as the physically meaningful quantity is @xmath105 .",
    "the same procedure yields for @xmath106 : @xmath107 and for @xmath108 @xmath109 it is seen that with increase of @xmath90 the ground state energy decreases , while the difference between ground and excited states increases . also , for decreased @xmath90 the situation is opposite .",
    "below we investigate this question in more details .    by increasing the matrix order from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , we improve the accuracy with which lowest states are reproduced and increase their number by one . for @xmath13",
    "we have for eigenenergies @xmath112 it is seen that while one more state appears , numerical outcomes for lowest states are corrected by approximately 1% .",
    "this statement is valid for all @xmath5 .    for the @xmath113 matrix and @xmath13 we have @xmath114    at the same time for @xmath108 @xmath115",
    "it is interesting to confront the above obtained ( still crude ) approximate eigenvalues with analytical expression , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath116^\\mu,\\ n=1,2,3, ... \\ ] ] table [ yt ] shows such comparison for three representative values of @xmath90 . it",
    "it seen a very good ( with the accuracy less then 1% ) coincidence between numerical values ( obtained from not small - sized @xmath113 matrix ) and those from expression .",
    "this already demonstrates the accuracy of our method for arbitrary @xmath90 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if compared with the previous methods of solution @xcite and @xcite , our spectral approach seems to be particularly powerful if one is interested in the spectrum of @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , we are able to generate an arbitrary number of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions with any desired accuracy . in table [ kuka ] we compare several ( first 20 and a couple of larger ) lowest eigenvalues of @xmath51 ( i.e. for typical case @xmath13 ) and answer how much actually the approximate formula deviates from computed @xmath117 s .",
    "it is seen from the table [ kuka ] that although the asymptotic formula delivers pretty good approximation to the desirable eigenvalues , the relative error never ( except for @xmath118 ) falls below @xmath119 % as the label number @xmath120 grows .",
    "we have actually traced this statement up to @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , the relative error , as it is seen from the table [ kuka ] , oscillates around @xmath119 % , which means that beginning with @xmath122 the expression for @xmath13 contributes 5 significant digits of the `` true '' asymptotic answer .",
    "note that for @xmath123 this number @xmath120 diminishes so that at @xmath124 the same result is obtained already for @xmath94 . on the other hand , at @xmath125 for @xmath126 we have only 3 significant digits .",
    "although the numerical calculations for the case @xmath13 are ( sometimes much ) less computer intensive then those for @xmath127 , the former case does not permit to trace the additional properties of the spectrum of the equation , which depend on @xmath90 .",
    "these properties are summarized in fig . [ qu ] . in left panel",
    "we plot the @xmath90 dependence of ground and first excited state energies .",
    "all other energies are also avalilable but their values at @xmath7 grow rapidly with @xmath120 so that for higher excited states not all @xmath90 s will fit the scale of the plot .",
    "this is because at @xmath7 the spectrum of the equation gives exactly that for ordinary quantum well @xcite , which in our units has the form @xmath128 i.e. it is proportional to @xmath129 . note that at @xmath7 the approximate dependence yields exactly thus also giving exact known result .    substituting @xmath54 and 2 into eq .",
    "we have , respectively @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which are seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ qu ] at @xmath7 . for instance , at @xmath132 @xmath133 , which is two times larger then @xmath134 .",
    "the most interesting feature of our method is that it permits to transit smoothly to the case @xmath32 , which does not included in the domain of the operator .",
    "moreover , the integrals and can be exactly evaluated in this case .",
    "this gives explicitly @xmath135 which , in turn , yields @xmath136 the expression immediately shows that at @xmath32 all eigenvalues of eq .",
    "equal to 1 .",
    "in other words , the entire spectrum of the operator at @xmath32 shrinks into one single value @xmath137 .",
    "this value is seen on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ qu ] .",
    "the character of spectrum shrinking at @xmath138 is shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ qu ] . here",
    "we report several first energy levels for different @xmath90 s .",
    "the expansion of the spectrum as @xmath139 and its shrinking as @xmath138 is clearly seen",
    ".    an important feature of the eigenfunctions of the operator is that , contrary to trigonometric functions for @xmath7 , they decay nonlinearly at @xmath22 .",
    "the hypothesis is that they vanish as @xmath140 . to check this hypothesis , in the inset to lower panel of fig . [ qu ]",
    "we plot ( shifting for convenience the left edge @xmath141 to zero ) the ground state wave functions ( points ) for different @xmath90 s along with functions @xmath142 in double logarithmic scale ( full lines ) .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath143 the coincidence is almost perfect .",
    "however , small deviations are seen already at @xmath144 .",
    "this is related to the approximate character of wave functions .",
    "to continue the points to smaller @xmath45 , the consideration of larger matrices is necessary , which ( even for eigenvectors of large matrices , corresponding to @xmath13 ) is extremely computer intensive task .",
    "most probably , the hypothesis about asymptotics @xmath140 is true .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the spectrum of the problem of a particle in the infinite potential well , obeying fractional quantum mechanics with arbitarary lvy index @xmath5 .",
    "this problem is relevant to many disordered and dissipative physical ( and biological , chemical and even social ) systems , involving lvy flights in bounded domains and is nontrivial as the familiar representation of fractional derivatives in fourier domain does not work in such confined case . to solve this problem ,",
    "we reduce the initial fractional scrdinger equation to the fredholm integral equation with hypersingular kernel . for the solution of latter equation",
    ", we have elaborated a novel and powerful method , based on the expansion over the complete set of the orthogonal functions taken from corresponding `` ordinary '' quantum mechanical problem for lvy index @xmath7 . in our case of the interval @xmath145 we use the trigonometric functions , which are eigenfunctions of the ordinary laplacian .",
    "let us finally mention the realistic physical systems , where we are going to apply our formalism .",
    "one of the important example is electronic tunneling characteristics in spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "spintronics or spin electronics is nowadays a branch of physics whose central theme is the active manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed , that spintronic devices can lead to applications ( like quantum computers ) that are so far infeasible with modern electronics . despite intense experimental and theoretical studies , the statistics of tunneling electrons through barriers in such structures",
    "remains unclear due to disorder which is inevitably present in such structures @xcite .",
    "the above barriers are technologically realized in inversion semiconductor layers , heterostructures ( like perovskite interface laalo@xmath146 - srtio@xmath146 @xcite ) , quantum wells or in graphene @xcite .",
    "the common formalism for description of electronic states in the above structures is different variations of particle in a potential well problem ( see , e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested that to describe the tunneling statistics adequately , the fractional derivatives should be brought into the above formalism .",
    "we are going to apply the developed formalism to the `` disordered '' quantum wells as well as to oxide interfaces @xcite , which also has interesting and non - trivial physical properties .",
    "one more problem is the electronic properties of so - called multiferroics , i.e. substances , combining several types of long - range orders ( like ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism ) . the non - gaussian statistics due to disorder plays an important role in these substances also @xcite and we are applying now our formalism ( also in context of the problem of quantum oscillator with fractional laplacian ) to obtain the adequate description of their physical properties .",

    "<S> we study lvy flights with arbitrary index @xmath0 inside a potential well of infinite depth . </S>",
    "<S> such problem appears in many physical systems ranging from stochastic interfaces to fracture dynamics and multifractality in disordered quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the major technical tool is a transformation of the eigenvalue problem for initial fractional schrdinger equation into that for fredholm integral equation with hypersingular kernel . </S>",
    "<S> the latter equation is then solved by means of expansion over the complete set of orthogonal functions in the domain @xmath1 , reducing the problem to the spectrum of a matrix of infinite dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are then obtained numerically with some analytical results regarding the structure of the spectrum . </S>"
