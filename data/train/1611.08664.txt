    "gliomas are a type of primary brain tumor that affect the glial cells in the brain . based on severity",
    ", gliomas are further divided to hgg and lgg .",
    "automatic segmentation of gliomas from mri , a preliminary step for treatment planning and determining disease progression , is a challenging task due to heterogeneity of tissue within the lesion , non uniform dynamic range of mr images and diffused borders of tumors .",
    "furthermore multiple mri sequences , namely t1 , t2 , flair and t1 post contrast ( t1c ) are required for accurate segmentation .",
    "these sequences provide complementary information about the lesion . for e.g. ,",
    "t2 weighted sequence and flair helps in segmenting the gross tumor while t1 post contrast sequence helps to delineate the enhancing tumor and necrotic region from gross lesion .",
    "a fully automated image segmentation pipeline is thus necessary for evaluating large number of patients across multiple centers .",
    "+      in the recent past , various fully automated techniques have been proposed to segment gliomas and they can be broadly classified as either generative or discriminative techniques @xcite .",
    "generative techniques model the joint distribution of the voxel classes and voxel specific features . a typical approach is to register the images onto an probabilistic atlas @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an atlas represents a normal healthy brain and comprises of white matter , gray matter , ventricles , brain stem etc .",
    "following registration various techniques have been developed to classify the tumor as an outlier / additional class .",
    "for e.g. @xcite used covariance determinant estimator to detect outliers followed by further segmentation using k - means algorithm .",
    "since the presence of large tumors or resectional cavities alter the structure of brain , the performance of generative models can be impacted by the registration technique used to align images and spatial priors @xcite .",
    "overall , as stated in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , generative techniques perform well on unseen data .",
    "a recent work @xcite on a hybrid generative / discriminative model for glioma segmentation shows a boost in performance by combining a generative and discriminative approach .",
    "discriminative techniques model / determine the class conditional distribution given the image features for eg .",
    "voxel intensities .",
    "discriminative techniques such as random forest @xcite-@xcite and support vector machines @xcite",
    ", @xcite have been applied to brain tumor segmentation .",
    "these techniques are suited for multiclass problems and uses hand coded features such as mean , median , skewness , symmetric of the brain to name a few , to classify voxels .",
    "discriminative techniques tend to misclassify certain voxels as lesion at anatomically and physiologically unlikely locations since each voxel is modeled to be independent from its neighbouring voxels @xcite .",
    "however , conditional random fields and markov random fields can be used to regularize the segmentation and could lead to improved results .",
    "the overall performance of discriminative techniques in general would depend on the quality of the computed features .    in the past decade , deep learning techniques such as deep belief networks , convolutional neural networks , stacked denosing autoencoders have been used in a variety of image classification and segmentation task @xcite-@xcite .",
    "deep learning techniques are capable of learning features such as edges , textures , patterns and various higher order features from raw images . recently convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have been used for segmentation of gliomas from mr images @xcite- @xcite and have outperformed other fully automatic techniques .",
    "cnns can be considered as discriminative models since they predict the posterior probability given the image features . typically , a large number of labeled data is required to train discriminative models especially deep learning based ones like cnns .    among deep learning models , restricted boltzman machines(rbm ) and deep boltzman machines @xcite can be considered as generative models .",
    "convolutional rbms @xcite have been used to extract features to aid semi - automated glioma segmentation and was judged the best entry in the brats 2015 challenge .",
    "the focus of this paper is on sdaes that learn a compact encoding of the data which can then be used as features for classification .",
    "autoencoders and its variants which include sdae s and sparse stacked autoencoders have been in various medical image processing applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "both rbms and autoencoders can be pre - trained using unlabeled data .",
    "rbms being energy based models are trained using markov chain techniques like gibbs sampling , while autoencoders , dae & sdae have the the advantage of being trained using gradient based backpropagation techniques .",
    "one of the major issues that arise in training deep networks is class imbalance .",
    "class imbalance is particularly acute in medical imaging problems since lesions constitute a miniscule percentage of image voxels .",
    "for instance in gliomas , lesion voxels form less than 2% of the total number of image voxels , in such scenarios a novelty / anomaly detection approach would be very effective .",
    "the principles of anomaly detection are well studied and typically involves detecting outliers or rare events by measuring a distance metric obtained from a parametric model of the data ( excluding the anomalies ) .",
    "autoencoders and other machine learning techniques @xcite , @xcite have also found applications in novelty detection but have not been explored in the context of brain lesion detection from multi - sequence mr images . in the next section",
    "the paper s original contribution is outlined based on the unsupervised training and novelty detection approach for glioma segmentation and ischemic lesion segmentation .",
    "this paper describes the application of denoising autoencoders for the detection and segmentation of brain lesions from multi - sequence mr images .",
    "specifically the contributions are :    * false positive reduction for gliomas and candidate detection for brain lesions ( ischemic lesion ) using a novelty detector . * variant of the novelty detector , called cascaded novelty detector ( cnd ) which generates unique error distributions for various constituents of glioma . * demonstrating semi supervised and weakly supervised learning by training sdae using patches drawn from limited patient volumes ( n=20 ) .",
    "* transfer learning approach for lgg , which had limited number of labeled training data .",
    "the lgg network was obtained by fine tuning the pre trained hgg network .",
    "the manuscript is laid out as follows .",
    "section ii describes the data set used , section iii describes the preprocessing of image data , training of sdae s and post processing using nd .",
    "section iv describes the results and discusses the performance of sdae s on test data for the brain tumor segmentation task .",
    "the paper concludes with the summary and discussion of future direction in section v.",
    "the publicly available brats-2015 data set @xcite , @xcite was used for training the networks . the data set comprises of 220 hgg and 54 lgg patient data .",
    "the hgg data set is composed of patients imaged only once ( single time point ) and patients who are scanned multiple times ( longitudinal data ) .",
    "the hgg data set comprises of 123 single time point patients ( st ) and 97 longitudinal patients ( lt ) , while no longitudinal studies were found in the lgg data set .",
    "each patient data comprises of a flair , t2 weighted , t1 weighted and t1 post contrast sequence .",
    "each voxel in the image volumes is classified as one of the five classes namely normal , edema , non enhancing tumor , necrotic region and enhancing tumor as summarized in table [ tabs : class ] .",
    "there exists huge data imbalance among classes in both hgg and lgg data set ( table [ data imbalance ] ) .",
    "furthermore , certain classes occur more frequently in one grade of glioma than the other , for e.g. enhancing tumor and necrotic region is more prominent in hgg while non enhancing tumor is more prominent in lgg .",
    ".labels associated to various types of lesion in the images [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ challenge ]",
    "in this paper we propose a completely automated brain tumor segmentation technique with a novel false positive / candidate detection method based on denoising autoencoders .    * despite differences in acquisition resolution , nd trained using non - lesion patches ( brats data ) was able to learn the normal brain structure and detect ischemic lesions ( isles data ) .",
    "a variant of nd ( cnd ) , wherein a cumulative error map was calculated for every voxel , was able to significantly improve lesion detection performance on isles data .",
    "in addition , cnd error maps assigned different error distributions to various constituents of glioma , making it an ideal tool to construct tumor atlases .",
    "this can also serve as a good initialization for various segmentation techniques . *",
    "the paper clearly demonstrates the ability of sdae s to produce good segmentation using minimal number of patient data .",
    "the redundancy of patches obtained from mr brain images was exploited to train networks . *",
    "the results presented are the prediction of a single network with minimal data pre - processing and post - processing .",
    "the n4 bias correction technique which is an oft used pre - processing step was eliminated .",
    "histogram matching to a reference data was still done and future work would be to eliminate the same by appropriate data normalization .",
    "skull stripping ( brats data and isles challenge data were skull stripped ) could potentially be eliminated as a separate step by using nd .",
    "the idea is to enable prediction on mr images without expensive pre - processing .    in summary the work presented applies sdae s for the brain lesion detection and segmentation task using a limited number of training data .",
    "the novelty detector concept allows for efficient elimination of false positives and candidate detection , making it a valuable cad tool .",
