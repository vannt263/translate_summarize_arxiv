    "magnetars are a class of highly magnetised , slowly rotating neutron star . in contrast to typical rotation - powered pulsars , a magnetar s magnetic field is believed to provide the energy reservoir needed to explain its quiescent activity and flaring episodes @xcite .",
    "most spectacularly , three of these stars have been seen to suffer giant flares , with energy output up to around @xmath2 erg . in the aftermath of the more recent two observations ,",
    "the data have been good enough to reveal the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray tail following the initial outburst . these qpos span a rather wide range of frequencies , from tens of hz up to khz , and many",
    "are only detected in short parts of the tail , which itself lasts for hundreds of seconds @xcite .",
    "these observations appear to represent the first direct detection of neutron star oscillations and hence should contain information about the star s equation of state ( eos ) , internal magnetic field configuration and so on .",
    "the problem is disentangling the contributions of these different aspects of the star s physics given the limited available data ; a flurry of papers since the original detections have aimed to do just that , through theoretical modelling of magnetar oscillations .",
    "initially several studies focused on either the purely crustal oscillation problem  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the magnetic mode interpretation by using different models and techniques  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a relevant result found by  @xcite and confirmed by other studies was that the spectrum of torsional alfvn oscillations in a star with a purely poloidal field is not discrete but consists of bands of continua .",
    "magnetised models with a crust show a strong interaction between the magnetic and elastic waves  @xcite , which form a single family of hybrid magneto - elastic oscillations ( for a more detailed description of the literature see sec .",
    "[ sec : qpo ] ) .    with general agreement about the oscillations of a single - fluid magnetar",
    ", attention has returned to the effect of neutron superfluidity on alfvn oscillations .",
    "earlier qualitative studies predicted that superfluidity would serve to increase the frequencies of magnetar qpos with respect to those of a single - fluid model @xcite .",
    "we confirmed this through numerical simulations , focusing on non - axisymmetric modes in a magnetar core @xcite .",
    "our results suggested that the higher - frequency observed qpos could be interpreted as alfvn core modes , and we conjectured that matching our core model to an elastic crust could allow for a set of low - frequency magneto - elastic modes too , thus accounting for the wide range of frequencies observed .",
    "this was very recently confirmed by @xcite , in the simplest case where the neutron fluid is totally decoupled from the charged ( proton plus electron ) fluid in the core .",
    "this study found constant - phase oscillations , indicating that the qpo spectrum of a superfluid star can become effectively discrete at typical magnetar field strengths @xmath3 g , where @xmath4 is the magnetic field at the pole .",
    "the neutron superfluid in a neutron star is likely to be coupled to the proton fluid to some degree , through entrainment @xcite . for strong entrainment , in fact",
    ", the dynamics of the system would return to that of a single - fluid model .",
    "another important aspect of multifluid physics in a neutron star is the non - constant ratio of protons to neutrons ; protons make up a smaller fraction of the outermost part of the core than they do deeper in the star .",
    "it is therefore important to check what influence these effects have on the star s oscillation spectrum .",
    "our aim in this paper is to include these two pieces of physics and hence make a fuller study of superfluid effects on magnetar qpos .",
    "this work focuses on axisymmetric oscillations and is intended to be complementary to our earlier work on non - axisymmetric magnetar qpos @xcite .",
    "we begin by discussing our unperturbed background models , followed by the perturbation equations for a magnetised multifluid star with an elastic crust and the time - evolution code we use to solve them .",
    "next , we confirm that our code reproduces earlier results for magnetar qpos in the single - fluid limit , before moving on to studying two representative models for superfluid magnetars .",
    "finally , we compare our results to the observations and discuss key outstanding issues in magnetar qpo modelling .",
    "three particle species are essential ingredients in a model neutron star : neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "these appear in different guises in different regions of the star , depending on the local density and temperature . in the crust ,",
    "protons and a fraction of neutrons are bound in a lattice of nuclei which become progressively heavier towards the bottom of the crust . when the density exceeds approximately @xmath5 , neutrons may drip out of the nuclei and , if the temperature is below about @xmath6k , form a gas of superfluid neutrons . also below this temperature , the neutrons and protons of the core are expected to become , respectively , superfluid and superconducting .",
    "the dynamics of a superfluid neutron star are therefore more complex than a single - fluid model .",
    "however , the number of degrees of freedom can be reduced , if we note that the electromagnetic force locks together the various charged particles on very short timescales compared with the typical mode oscillation periods .",
    "this means that the charged particles can then be considered as a single neutral conglomerate of comoving particles .",
    "a basic superfluid neutron star can therefore be studied from a dynamical point of view as a two - fluid system . in the core ,",
    "the two constituents are the superfluid neutrons and a neutral mixture of charged particles that for simplicity we call ` protons ' .",
    "these two - fluid constituents are , respectively , denoted with n and p. although the core protons are likely to be superconducting , we regard them as a normal fluid in this work , where our focus is rather the effect of neutron superfluidity on magnetar qpos . in the inner crust , we may discern a fraction of free superfluid neutrons which permeates the lattice of nuclei , in which protons and the remaining part of neutrons are confined .",
    "these two crust constituents are denoted with f and c for , respectively , free superfluid neutrons and confined baryons .",
    "assuming we have small perturbations away from equilibrium , we may make the usual separation of the full system of equations for two - fluid magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) into a set governing the stationary background star and a set of time - evolution equations for the perturbations .",
    "we will see that , within our approximations , the background models are purely fluid with the two species fully decoupled ; entrainment and elastic terms enter only at the order of the perturbations .",
    "we discuss solving the background and perturbation equations in turn in the next sections .",
    "the background models are constructed as described in @xcite .",
    "these are self - consistent multipolar solutions , accounting for the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the stellar fluid .",
    "the basic effect of neutron superfluidity , decoupling the protons and increasing the alfvn mode frequencies , may be accounted for with a basic single - fluid unstratified background .",
    "however , we wish to explore the effect of more realistic configurations : stratification ( i.e. a non - constant proton fraction ) , entrainment and a two - fluid core matched to a single - fluid crust .",
    "we consider stellar models based on a two - fluid polytropic eos , with an energy functional @xmath7 given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 are constants and @xmath10 are the polytropic indices for each species .",
    "this simple eos allows us to construct models with composition stratification by choosing different polytropic indices for protons and neutrons , @xmath11 .",
    "our models consist of a fluid core and an elastic crust , with the crust - core boundary at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the star s radius . since we assume that the crust is relaxed for the background configurations the equations reduce to those of a purely fluid model ; elastic terms enter only into the perturbation equations .    in this paper",
    "we aim to study oscillations of two ` representative ' model magnetars , encapsulating the real physics of the system as best our framework allows .",
    "in addition , we will also need to investigate intermediate cases , in order to track modes from the well - studied single - fluid regime into new superfluid territory .    for basic tests , we use an unstratified model in which @xmath14 , and the proton and confined baryon fraction is @xmath15 .",
    "this model has been already used in literature  ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we term it ` model a1 ' .",
    "we generalise this model a1 by adding an `` artificial '' composition gradient both in the core and the crust .",
    "the relations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 try to mimic the profile expected in more realistic models , where the proton fraction decreases from the centre to the crust / core transition and the confined baryon fraction increases into the inner crust up to unity at the neutron drip transition .",
    "this is not fully consistent , but for a pure - poloidal magnetic field geometry the axial modes are decoupled from the polar sector and the only background quantity that appears in the dynamical equations is the mass density .",
    "therefore , this is a ` controlled ' inconsistency that is quite appropriate for the aims of our current work .",
    "more specifically , we consider @xmath18 in the core and @xmath19 in the crust , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two constants that depend on the value of @xmath22 and its derivative at @xmath23 .",
    "we call this particular configuration `` model a2 '' and its composition stratification is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "another property that characterises superfluid neutron stars is the entrainment , which is a non - dissipative process that couples the dynamics of protons and superfluid neutrons .",
    "this effect is due to the strong interaction which limits the free motion of each individual particle species .",
    "the entrainment can be described , from the dynamical point of view , in terms of an effective nucleon mass which replaces its own ` bare ' mass in the dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "although our background models are non - rotating , this quantity affects the dynamics of linear perturbations ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : perts ] . at the bottom of the inner crust",
    ", the effective mass of superfluid neutrons may be quite large @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the neutron bare mass .",
    "this strong entrainment originates from the neutron bragg scattering from the nuclei lattice  @xcite . in a core with superfluid / superconducting constituents ,",
    "the neutron effective mass typically is @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "although we consider normal core protons in our stellar models , we investigate also configurations with non - zero core entrainment to estimate the effect on the spectrum ; note that in this case one should include proton superconductivity , so our core magnetar model is not strictly consistent .",
    "we introduce the effects of entrainment in our model by using the approximation to the effective mass profile determined by chamel  @xcite .",
    "we form one of our two key test models , denoted `` model a3 '' , by using this entrainment profile with the same composition gradient described above for model a2 .",
    "the entrainment profile is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we also study a model with two fluids in the core and only a single fluid in the crust .",
    "this model , which we call ` model s ' , is obtained by choosing @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in this case",
    "we set the central proton fraction @xmath29 .",
    "the resultant @xmath16 profile partially mimics the imposed profile from the previous model , but within a fully self - consistent framework ; this is shown , together with the magnetic field configuration , in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this model s can be thought of as a young magnetar which has a superfluid core and a normal crust , i.e. a star in which the crust s temperature is still above the neutron critical temperature @xcite .",
    "this model can be also considered an approximation to a star with a strong entrainment in the inner crust , in which the motion of the free superfluid neutrons is almost comoving with the confined baryons of the crustal lattice .    we provide our results in dimensionless units which are constructed from the gravitational constant , @xmath30 , the total central mass density , @xmath31 , and the star s radius , @xmath13 .",
    "the dimensionless masses for models a and s are , respectively , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the crust / core transition is at @xmath12 where the dimensionless mass density is @xmath34 and @xmath35 for models a and s , respectively .",
    "the differences in the values of @xmath36 reflect the fact that our toy double - polytrope models can not reproduce all features of a tabulated eos .",
    "let us now derive the evolution equations of axisymmetric ( @xmath37 ) perturbations , where @xmath38 is the azimuthal number .",
    "for a purely poloidal or toroidal magnetic field , axisymmetric oscillations can be decoupled in polar and axial perturbations .",
    "the polar sector describes compressible oscillations which are driven by the radial and theta velocity components and the density perturbation .",
    "the axial perturbations instead describe an incompressible motion along the azimuthal coordinate , which can be completely characterised for each species by the single velocity component @xmath39 , where the index ` x ' denotes the fluid constituents : p and n in the core , c and f in the crust .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the axial sector , which is considered the most relevant for magnetar qpos : the oscillation frequencies appear better matched to the observations ( at least in the single - fluid case ) and , being incompressible , the axial modes can be excited with a smaller energy @xcite .",
    "however , polar perturbations should not be completely neglected in a more general magnetar model .",
    "in fact , in stars with a general mixed poloidal - toroidal magnetic field , the axial and polar sectors couple and the mode spectrum can be considerably affected @xcite .",
    "in addition , polar perturbations might be relevant for understanding the qpos observed at higher frequencies .",
    "we intend to study these modes in a future paper .    in a superfluid and magnetised neutron star ,",
    "the dynamics of axial oscillations can be described by momentum conservation equations for each fluid constituent and by the induction equation  @xcite .",
    "the mass conservation and poisson equations are automatically satisfied due to the incompressibility of the axial perturbations , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote , respectively , the lagrangian and eulerian perturbations .",
    "since the axial oscillations of a non - rotating superfluid star with a purely poloidal magnetic field are characterised by the @xmath43 component of the velocity and magnetic field perturbations , we omit the coordinate index from all perturbation variables .",
    "therefore @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the superfluid neutrons of the core in a non - rotating star obey the following equation : @xmath48 where the parameter @xmath49 accounts for the entrainment between the nucleons .",
    "as already pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : back_pert ] the entrainment describes the relative dragging that a fluid constituent induces on the other component .",
    "this entrainment parameter is related to the effective mass by @xmath50 .",
    "to study the dynamics of an elastic crust it is more suitable to introduce the lagrangian displacement for each fluid constituent @xcite , which is defined in a non - rotating star by the following expression : @xmath51 equation  ( [ eq : eulern ] ) therefore can be re - written as follows @xmath52 the free neutron gas of the inner crust obeys the same equation  ( [ eq : eulernb ] ) provided we replace the symbols n with f and p with c.    in the ideal mhd approximation and for non - superconducting protons , the oscillations of the p - fluid in the core are restored by the lorentz force , and the momentum equation reads @xmath53    the confined baryons of the crust interact with the magnetic field via the lorentz force but can also sustain shear waves due to the elasticity of the ion lattice .",
    "consequently , the dynamical equation for the confined constituent is given by @xmath54 where the elastic stress tensor is defined by @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the elastic shear modulus . for the crust s shear modulus",
    ", we use the approximate relation @xmath57 which is based on the observation that the specific shear modulus is almost constant through the crust with @xmath58  .",
    "next , by using ampre s law to replace the electric current , the lorentz force assumes the following form : @xmath59 while the evolution of the magnetic field is described by the induction equation : @xmath60 in the crust , the proton velocity must be replaced with @xmath61 , i.e the velocity perturbation of the confined fluid component .",
    "the dynamical problem of the axial axisymmetric oscillations of a superfluid magnetised star with crust can be studied with a single wave equation for the proton component in the core and the confined baryons in the crust , as in the single - fluid model .",
    "focusing for a moment on the crust , the first step to derive this wave equation is to use equation  ( [ eq : eulernb ] ) for the crust constituents and remove in equation  ( [ eq : eulerc ] ) the superfluid neutron variable @xmath62 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : eulerc ] ) can then be written as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a new parameter that accounts for entrainment defined by @xmath65 this new entrainment parameter can be written in terms of the effective mass  @xcite : @xmath66 the zero entrainment case in which protons and neutrons are entirely decoupled is given by @xmath67 . the entirely coupled ` one - fluid ' limit where protons and neutrons comove is given by the @xmath68 limit which leads to @xmath69 .",
    "the second step is to perturb the lorentz force  ( [ eq : fl ] ) and use the time integration of equation  ( [ eq : beq ] ) to replace the perturbation of the magnetic field @xmath45 with the lagrangian displacement @xmath70 . after some calculation",
    ", one may show that the c component obeys the following wave equation : @xmath71 where the @xmath72 coefficients depends on the background variables and are given in the appendix .",
    "the core s protons obey the same wave equation with the coefficients @xmath72 taken in the zero shear modulus limit , @xmath73 .",
    "the regularity condition for equation  ( [ eq : wv ] ) and the variable @xmath74 at the centre ( @xmath75 ) lead to a zero condition for the lagrangian displacement @xmath76 . for axial axisymmetric perturbations",
    "the variable @xmath74 and @xmath70 also vanish at the magnetic symmetry axis .    at the core / crust interface ,",
    "we need to impose the continuity of the @xmath43 component of the lagrangian displacement  @xcite @xmath77 and the continuity of the traction . for a purely poloidal magnetic field and non - rotating star , the @xmath43 component of the traction in the crust",
    "is given by @xmath78 while in the core it assumes the same form provided we replace the index c with p and set a zero shear modulus ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "from equation  ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) and the continuity of the magnetic field across the interface , the traction condition reads @xmath79    at the surface of the star our evolutions must satisfy a zero traction condition ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "with respect to the equatorial plane , the axial @xmath81 perturbations divide in a symmetric and anti - symmetric class .",
    "the symmetric oscillation modes satisfy @xmath82 at @xmath83 , while the anti - symmetric modes obey @xmath84 .",
    "the wave equation  ( [ eq : wv ] ) is evolved in time on a two - dimensional grid which covers the first quadrant of the @xmath85 plane , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this restriction to the first quadrant is feasible due to the equatorial reflection symmetries of the axial @xmath37 oscillations .",
    "the spatial derivatives are discretised by using a second order approximation , while the time integration of equation  ( [ eq : wv ] ) is carried out by using an explicit iterative crank - nicholson method .",
    "we use various grid resolutions to test our results and have also used meshes with finer resolution in the crust in order to describe properly the shear waves .",
    "however , the results shown in this paper have been determined with an evenly spaced grid with resolution @xmath88 , respectively , in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 coordinates . to stabilise the simulations from high - frequency noise",
    ", we add an artificial fourth - order oliger - kreiss dissipation term , @xmath91 , with a small dissipation coefficient @xmath92 .",
    "the junction conditions  ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cc2 ] ) at the crust / core interface are used to determine at any time step the value of @xmath93 at @xmath23 .",
    "this is obtained by discretising equation  ( [ eq : cc2 ] ) with a side - stencil derivative both in the core and the crust region and then using equation  ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) .",
    "the initial data of our time evolutions are a linear combination of various shear mode eigenfunctions of an unmagnetised star which are determined with an eigenfrequency code  @xcite .",
    "these eigenfunctions are prolonged into the core by matching them continuously with polynomial functions in the radial coordinate .",
    "the angular part of the initial data must obey the boundary conditions described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bc ] .",
    "in magnetars , the qpo spectrum is believed to originate from magneto - elastic waves which arise from the dynamical interaction between the global magnetic field oscillations and the shear waves of the crust .",
    "the strong magnetic field of magnetars in fact efficiently couples the dynamics of the core and the crust , and the families of the shear and alfvn modes are not independent anymore .",
    "it is more appropriate to consider them as a unique class of magneto - elastic oscillations .",
    "many of the observed qpo frequencies fall in the range @xmath94hz , suggesting that they may be generated by oscillations with axial parity and symmetry .",
    "this hypothesis is also supported by the minor energy required to excite the axial and axisymmetric modes , making them more suitable for the qpo seismic origin interpretation .",
    ".[tab:1 ] this table displays the frequencies of the first three axial shear modes determined with the current time domain evolution ( td ) and with the frequency domain ( fd ) approach .",
    "the mode frequencies for the @xmath95 multipoles are shown in dimensionless units @xmath96 for an unstratified model with constant component fraction @xmath97 and with no magnetic field .",
    "the results obtained with these two different approaches agree to within a few percent . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another possibility is that the high - frequency qpos are non - axisymmetric magnetic modes of the superfluid core . for surface fields of the order of @xmath98 g , we found that the 150 and 625 hz qpos of sgr1806 - 20 and the 155 hz qpo of sgr1900 + 14 could plausibly be ` fundamental ' @xmath99 alfvn oscillations  @xcite . even in this scenario , however , the 1837 hz frequency would have to be some kind of higher order mode  either an overtone or a mode with @xmath100 .",
    "the original discovery of magnetar qpos , in the right frequency range to be shear modes of the crust , brought hopes of probing the neutron star interior and constraining the eos of dense matter .",
    "these hopes have been somewhat diluted , as it has become clear that more physics is at play in magnetar qpos than simply the star s elastic crust . on the other hand , these complications mean that there is potentially additional information to be gleaned from these observations : the magnetic field structure within a neutron star and the nature of any superfluid / superconducting components .",
    "the entirety of observations to date consist of two sets of data : the decaying x - ray tails that followed the giant flares of two soft gamma repeaters .",
    "these tails are clearly modulated at the rotation rate of each star ; it has been suggested that what we see is a fireball above the star but anchored to its surface @xcite .",
    "if the observed qpos do indeed correspond to oscillations of the star , these must also be propagated from the surface through this fireball .",
    "the qpos themselves cover a frequency band from tens of hz up to khz , many of them only appearing in certain parts of the x - ray tail .    in this work ,",
    "we attack the problem of modelling magnetar qpos by looking at the behaviour of linearised perturbations of a magnetised star , accounting for the effect of superfluid neutrons and an elastic crust .",
    "this clearly only addresses part of the phenomenology described above  indeed , the best - studied part of it  attempting to link the frequencies of observed qpos to different classes of stellar oscillation .",
    "nonetheless , we can still learn something from this endeavour .    in a magnetar with a single - fluid crust and two - fluid core with composition stratification",
    ", we find that many magnetic oscillations are able to penetrate the crust and could explain the lowest frequency observed qpos , 17 - 18hz , as well as others in the range up to @xmath101 hz . in a magnetar model with superfluid neutrons both in the inner crust and the core , the strong crustal entrainment reduces the frequencies of the shear modes . as a result ,",
    "a new series of magneto - elastic waves with hybrid character appears . for a typical magnetar field strength ( @xmath102 g )",
    "they have frequency close to that of shear modes of a unmagnetised model , but their oscillation pattern is not localised into the crust .",
    "we call these global oscillations @xmath103 in order to recall their analogy with crustal axial modes ( torsional modes ) .    in superfluid models with strong entrainment in the crust and @xmath3 g , the frequency range @xmath104  hz contains a number of @xmath103 modes which are not damped by coupling with the core , in contrast with the shear waves of the single - fluid case . moreover , the overtones of @xmath103 oscillations appear at higher frequencies and could explain qpos in the range @xmath105 hz .",
    "this result is in agreement with the recent work of  @xcite numerical limitations however prevent us from reliably determining their duration . in our current models with superfluid neutrons in the crust ,",
    "qpos below @xmath106 hz become harder to explain if a ` standard ' shear modulus value and typical magnetar field strengths are used .",
    "recent results from  @xcite find discrete alfvn modes in a superfluid star , replacing the continuous spectrum of single - fluid models . in an attempt to confirm this result ,",
    "we have studied also the behaviour of the qpo phase in our stellar models to determine the discrete / continuum nature of the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , our results do not provide conclusive evidence that the spectrum is fundamentally different in the superfluid case .",
    "this is certainly a problem which deserves more accurate investigation in future work .",
    "our current newtonian polytropic models are able to describe the properties of many magnetar qpos , even with a relatively low dipolar magnetic field , depending on the particular model",
    ". it would be possible to ` tune ' our results to the observed data and find a fit for each observed frequency . nonetheless , with so many degrees of freedom at play",
    ", we do not think any reliable conclusions could be drawn from this approach . instead , a more detailed analysis of the parameter space will be carried out in a future work where also relativistic effects and tabulated eoss will be considered .",
    "important physics typically missing from studies of the dynamical - timescale problem of linearised oscillations include the effect of proton superconductivity and the fact that magnetars may not be old enough for neutrons to have condensed into a superfluid throughout the core , but only in regions . like the effect of entrainment",
    ", this would tend to reduce the superfluid enhancement of alfvn frequencies .",
    "for example , one might naively assume that magnetic oscillations of sgr1900 + 14 should be of lower frequency than the corresponding oscillations of sgr1806 - 20 , since the former magnetar has a lower inferred dipole field .",
    "it is also an order of magnitude older @xcite , however , so its core should contain a larger region with superfluid neutrons  and its oscillations would then be _ higher _ in frequency .",
    "perhaps a more pressing problem is explaining why some qpos appear and disappear in the middle of the tail but others survive for hundreds of seconds .",
    "this might involve studying possible mode couplings to see if some oscillations maintain their energy at the expense of others .",
    "more detailed modelling is clearly also required to explain the locally heated , post - flare magnetosphere of the magnetar and how stellar oscillations propagate through this to become visible to us .",

    "<S> the distribution of lower - frequency magneto - elastic oscillations for our models is qualitatively similar to the observed magnetar qpos with @xmath0hz . _ in particular , some of these qpos could represent mixed magneto - elastic oscillations with frequencies not greatly different from the crustal modes of an unmagnetised star . </S>",
    "<S> _ we find that many qpos could even be accounted for using a model with a relatively weak polar field of @xmath1 g , because of the superfluid enhancement of magnetic oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the possible identification of 625 and 1837  hz qpos either with non - axisymmetric modes or with high - frequency axisymmetric qpos excited by crustal mode overtones .    </S>",
