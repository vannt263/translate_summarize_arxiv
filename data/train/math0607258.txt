    "in the 1980s , a plethora of new knot invariants were discovered , following the discovery of the jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "these powerful invariants were by construction _ chiral _",
    ", i.e.  they were often able to distinguish knots from their mirrors , as opposed to many of their classical counterparts .",
    "soon after the appearance of these new quantum invariants of knots , many people studied their behavior under other kinds of involutions , and in particular under mutation .",
    "chmutov , duzhin , lando , lickorish , lipson , morton , traczyk and others pioneered the behavior of the quantum knot invariants under mutation ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the quantum invariants come in two flavors : rationally valued vassiliev invariants , and polynomially valued exact invariants ( such as the jones , homfly , kauffman , alexander polynomials ) , see @xcite . later on , abelian group",
    "valued invariants were constructed by khovanov @xcite .    here , we study the behavior of classical and quantum invariants of knots in @xmath1 under mutation , building on the above mentioned work .",
    "the notion of mutation was introduced by conway in  @xcite , and has been used extensively in various generalized forms .",
    "let us start by explaining what we mean by mutation .",
    "roughly , mutation is modifying a 3-manifold by cutting it open along a certain kind of embedded surface , and then regluing in a different way .",
    "more precisely , consider one of the surfaces @xmath2 from figure  [ fig : symmetricsurface ] , together with the specified involution @xmath3 ; we will call the pair @xmath4 a _ symmetric surface_. suppose @xmath2 is a symmetric surface properly embedded in a compact orientable 3-manifold .",
    "the _ mutant _ of @xmath5 along @xmath2 is the result of cutting @xmath5 open along @xmath2 , and then regluing the two copies of @xmath2 by the involution @xmath3 .",
    "the mutant manifold is denoted @xmath6 , and the operation is called _",
    "mutation_. when we want to distinguish the topological type of @xmath2 , we refer to @xmath7-mutation where @xmath8 is the genus and @xmath9 is the number of boundary components .",
    "the involutions used in mutation have very special properties , e.g.   if @xmath10 is a non  boundary - parallel simple closed curve , then @xmath11 is isotopic to @xmath10 ( neglecting orientations ) . as a result , while mutation is typically violent enough to change the global topology of @xmath5 , it is simultaneously subtle enough that many invariants do not change .",
    "studying this phenomenon has enriched our understanding of a number of invariants , be they classical , quantum , or geometric .",
    "when studying knots in @xmath1 , the most natural type of mutation is @xmath12-mutation , which has a simple interpretation in terms of a knot diagram , and is known to preserve a wide range of invariants . here",
    ", we study the effects of @xmath13-mutation on knots in @xmath1 . by this",
    ", we mean the following .",
    "if @xmath2 is a closed 2-surface in @xmath1 , then the mutant @xmath14 is always homeomorphic to @xmath1 ( see section  [ subsec.knotmut ] ) .",
    "thus if @xmath15 is a knot in @xmath1 which is disjoint from @xmath2 , it makes sense to talk about its mutant @xmath16 .",
    "pictures / symsurfaces.pstex_t    in this context , @xmath13-mutation is the most general type : any of the above mutations can be achieved by a sequence of at most two @xmath13-mutations ( see lemma  [ lem.20suffice ] below ) . given that any @xmath12-mutation can be implemented in this way , you might expect that an invariant unchanged by @xmath12-mutation would also be preserved by @xmath13-mutations .",
    "it turns out that this is not the case , as you can see from the following table ; with the possible exception of khovanov homology , all of the invariants listed there are preserved by @xmath12-mutation .",
    "c|c preserved by @xmath13-mutation & changed by @xmath13-mutation +   + hyperbolic volume / gromov norm + of the knot exterior & homfly - pt polynomial + alexander polynomial and + generalized signature & @xmath0-khovanov homology + colored jones polynomials & +    the results on the left - hand side are due either entirely or in large part to ruberman  @xcite , cooper - lickorish  @xcite and morton - traczyk  @xcite , see below for details ; the results on the right are new . one way of interpreting these results might be that the invariants on the left are more tied to the topology of @xmath17 , whereas those on the right are more `` diagrammatic '' and tied to combinatorics of knot projections .",
    "( of course , this must be taken with more than a grain of salt , since knots are determined by their complements  @xcite . )",
    "the presence of the colored jones polynomials among the more `` topological '' invariants is not so surprising given their connections to purely geometric / topological invariants in the context of the volume conjecture ( e.g.  the results of @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , one of our original motivations for this work was to better understand the volume conjecture , which proposes a relationship between the colored jones polynomials and the hyperbolic volume .",
    "the fact that both the colored jones polynomials and hyperbolic volume are preserved by @xmath13-mutation is positive evidence for this conjecture .    one interesting open problem about @xmath12-mutation is whether this operation can change the @xmath0-khovanov homology introduced in  @xcite . for @xmath13-mutation",
    ", we settle the analogous question :    [ thm.1 ] the @xmath0-khovanov homology is not invariant under @xmath13-mutation of knots .",
    "in particular , the pair of @xmath13-mutant knots in figure  [ 14npair ] have differing khovanov homologies .",
    "for the odd variant of @xmath0-khovanov homology , bloom recently showed that it is invariant under @xmath12-mutation @xcite ; as a consequence , the normal @xmath0-khovanov homology with mod 2 coefficients is also invariant .",
    "we do not whether either of these invariants is preserved by @xmath13-mutation .",
    "is the odd @xmath0-khovanov homology preserved by genus 2 mutation ?",
    "the @xmath18-homology introduced by khovanov and rozansky  @xcite can not be invariant under @xmath13-mutation , simply because the euler characteristic need not be , since the homfly - pt polynomial can change under @xmath13-mutation .",
    "( left ) and @xmath19 ( right ) , in knotscape notation.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( left ) and @xmath19 ( right ) , in knotscape notation.,title=\"fig : \" ]    one final result of this paper is    [ prop.1 ] there exist knots with same colored jones polynomials ( for all colors ) , homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials , volume and signature , but different khovanov ( and reduced khovanov ) homology .",
    "the knots from figure  [ 14npair ] are again examples here , and all the above claimed properties except for the khovanov homology are consequences of the fact that they are @xmath13-mutant ( see  figure  [ fig : cabled - mutants].a ) .",
    "these same knots were studied by stoimenow and tanaka  @xcite , who showed that these knots are not @xmath12-mutants , yet have the same colored jones polynomials .",
    "( stoimenow and tanaka use notation @xmath20 and @xmath21 for what we denote @xmath22 and @xmath19 , respectively . )",
    "there are other invariants whose behavior under genus 2 mutation it would be interesting to understand . in particular :    is the kauffman polynomial invariant under genus 2 mutation ? what about the property of having unknotting number one ?",
    "classical conway @xmath12-mutation preserves both these properties @xcite . as we discuss in section  [ sub.kauffman ] below",
    ", we expect that , in analogy with what happens with the homfly - pt polynomial , genus 2 mutation should be able to change the kauffman polynomial .",
    "* addendum : * morton and ryder have confirmed this , showing that the kauffman polynomial is _ not _ invariant under genus 2 mutation @xcite .",
    "we now detail where the results in table  [ table.main ] come from .",
    "the invariance of the hyperbolic volume , or more generally the gromov norm , was proven by ruberman for all types of mutation  @xcite .",
    "the statement  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.5 ) requires an additional hypothesis on @xmath2 , but arguments elsewhere in  @xcite negate the need for this ; see our discussion of theorem  [ thm.volume ] below .",
    "cooper and lickorish proved the invariance of the alexander polynomial and generalized signature under a more limited class of @xmath13-mutations than we consider here  @xcite .",
    "this class , which we call handlebody mutations , turns out to be the main case anyway , and thus it is not hard to conclude the more general result ; see theorem  [ thm.alex ] below .",
    "in the case of the colored jones polynomials ( for a definition see e.g.  @xcite ) , the result essentially follows from morton - traczyk  @xcite , which we modify as theorem  [ thm.cjones ] . in the case of the non - invariance of the homfly - pt polynomials",
    ", we give explicit examples based on the ideas of section  [ sub.homfly-pt ] .",
    "as usual , the presentation of our results does not follow the historical order by which they were discovered .",
    "the project started by running a computer program of a.sh .",
    "( see  @xcite ) to all knots with less than or equal to @xmath23 crossings , taken from knotscape  @xcite .",
    "the computer found a single pair of @xmath24 crossing knots with the same homfly - pt polynomial , kauffman polynomial , signature , volume and different khovanov homology , and four pairs of @xmath25 crossing knots with same behavior .",
    "the knots were isolated , redrawn , and a pattern was found .",
    "namely , the knots in the above pairs have diagrams that differ by a so - called cabled mutation ( see section  [ sub.cabledmutation ] for a definition ) . cabled mutation",
    "can always be achieved by @xmath13-mutation .",
    "this , together with a kauffman bracket skein theory argument ( which we later found in morton - traczyk s work  @xcite ) implies that these pairs have identical colored jones polynomials , for all colors . at that time , the numerical equality of the volumes of these pairs was rather mysterious .",
    "later on , we found that cabled mutation is a special case of @xmath13-mutation .",
    "ruberman s theorem explained why these pairs have equal volume .",
    "once it was observed that khovanov homology was not invariant under @xmath13-mutation , we asked whether this was true for other well - known knot invariants , such as the colored jones polynomials , the homfly - pt and the kauffman polynomials .",
    "once we realized that the homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials ought to detect @xmath13-mutation ( and even cabled mutation ) , we tried to find examples of such knots .",
    "the authors wish to thank i. agol , d. bar - natan and g. masbaum for useful conversations ; l. kauffman , j. przytycki and f. souza for organizing an ams meeting in snowbird , utah , and g. masbaum and p. vogel for their hospitality in paris vii , where the work was initiated .",
    "finally , we wish to thank the computer team at georgia tech and in particular lew lefton and justin filoseta for their support in large scale computations .",
    "this section gives the basic topological lemmas about mutation that we will need .",
    "in addition to checking that @xmath13-mutation of a knot in @xmath1 makes sense ( i.e.  mutating @xmath1 along such a surface always gives back @xmath1 ) , we will show that one can usually reduce to the case where the mutation surface has a number of special properties .",
    "finally , we introduce the notion of cabled mutation for knots in @xmath1 , which is a special type of genus 2 mutation which is easy to realize diagrammatically .",
    "we begin in the context of general 3-manifolds before specializing to the case of knots in @xmath1 . from a topological point of view , it is often best to work with mutation surfaces that are incompressible .",
    "the following proposition is implicit in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  5 ) , and explicit in a slightly weaker form in  (",
    "2.2 ) ; one application below will be to show that mutation makes sense for knots in @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath27 can be obtained by mutating along one or two incompressible , non - boundary parallel tori , or 3 .",
    "@xmath28 .",
    "the basic idea here is that if @xmath2 is compressible , then @xmath6 is homeomorphic to the result of mutating @xmath5 along any surface obtained by compressing @xmath2 .",

    "initially , let us suppose that @xmath30 is a non - separating curve in @xmath2 .",
    "the key property of the hyper - elliptic involution @xmath3 is that if @xmath10 is any non - separating simple closed curve in @xmath2 , then @xmath11 is isotopic to @xmath10 with the orientation reversed .",

    "( you can also see the homeomorphism of @xmath41 needed to build the map @xmath45 directly  thinking of @xmath41 as a pancake , just flip it over . )    thus in the case that @xmath30 is non - separating , we have shown that @xmath6 is homeomorphic to a mutant of @xmath5 along a torus @xmath34 . if @xmath30 is separating , then the picture is essentially the same . in this case , we can isotope @xmath30 so that @xmath3 fixes it pointwise .",

    "mutating along @xmath48 is the same as doing a certain mutation along the original surface @xmath2 , for reasons similar to the proof of proposition  [ prop.incompressiblemutation ] . in the case where @xmath2 is a 4-punctured sphere ,",
    "it may not be possible that the desired involution @xmath57 can be directly induced by mutation along a tubed surface @xmath48 ; however , in this case the needed mutation can be realized by mutating along the possible choices for @xmath48 in succession .",

    "direct computation with the ewing - millett computer program implemented in knotscape shows that @xmath82 and @xmath84 have different homfly - pt polynomials .",
    "coefficients of these polynomials are given in tables  [ tbl : homfly - pt1 ] and [ tbl : homfly - pt2 ] on pages   and ( with zero entries omitted ) .",
    "for example , the coefficient of the monomial @xmath85 is @xmath86 in both polynomials . on the other hand ,",
    "the coefficients of @xmath87 are @xmath88 for @xmath82 and @xmath89 for @xmath84 .",
    "here is a heuristic reason why the homfly - pt polynomial is not invariant under @xmath13-mutation , which explains how we came across our pair of @xmath90 crossing knots .",
    "first , it was already known that there are @xmath13-mutant _ links _ with different homfly - pt polynomials @xcite . in particular , start with the kinoshita - terasaka and conway knots which are a famous pair of 11 crossing knots which differ by @xmath12-mutation .",
    "morton and traczyk showed ( see @xcite ) that taking a certain disconnected @xmath91-cable of each of these knots gives a pair of links with differing homfly - pt polynomials ; this gives a pair of cabled - mutant links with distinct homfly - pt polynomials .",
    "( in contrast , lickorish - lipson showed  @xcite that the homfly - pt polynomial of 2-cables of mutant knots are always equal . )",
    "this suggests that we should have a good chance of getting a pair of connected cabled mutant knots with distinct homfly - pt polynomials by the following procedure : take as a pattern tangle the one that appears in the kinoshita - terasaka and conway pair , cable each of its components @xmath91 times , and close it up to a knot in some fairly arbitrary way .",
    "this is exactly how we found the pair of knots with @xmath90 crossings .",
    "the heuristic reasons for the non - invariance of the homfly - pt polynomial under @xmath13-mutation applies equally well in the case of the kauffman polynomial . for this reason",
    ", we expect that the kauffman polynomial is not invariant under @xmath13-mutation . to show this , it suffices to present a pair of cabled mutant knots with different kauffman polynomials .",
    "however , the available computer programs for computing the kauffman polynomial do not work well with knots with more than 50 crossings , and this has prevented us from examining any interesting examples . *",
    "addendum : * morton and ryder have now succeeded in showing that the kauffman polynomial is _ not _ invariant under genus 2 mutation @xcite .",
    "now we show there exist knots with the same colored jones , homfly - pt , and kauffman polynomials , the same volume and signature , but different khovanov homology .",
    "consider the tangles @xmath34 and @xmath68 from figure  [ fig : tangles - cabled ] .",
    "denote by @xmath92 and @xmath93 their @xmath94-cables , respectively ( for some fixed @xmath72 ) .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath62 be two knots that differ by replacement of @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 and @xmath62 are connected cabled mutants and , thus , @xmath13-mutant",
    ". theorems [ thm.volume ] and [ thm.cjones ] thus imply that @xmath15 and @xmath62 have equal colored jones polynomials and volume . a priori , @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath62 could have different homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials .",
    "however , an elementary computation in the respective skein theories imply that @xmath15 and @xmath62 also have equal homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials .",
    "when @xmath95 , let us choose the closure of @xmath96 in one of the ways from figure  [ fig : cabled - mutants ] to obtain five pairs of knots .",
    "in knotscape notation  @xcite , these five pairs are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , where the bar above the number of crossings means the mirror image of the corresponding knot .",
    "computer calculations with khoho  @xcite show that knots from these pairs have different khovanov homology ( see section  [ sub.data ] ) .",
    "we say that two knots are _ almost mutant _ if they have the same homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials , signature , and hyperbolic volume .",
    "this is an equivalence relation .",
    "note that mutant knots are almost mutant .",
    "we can partition the set of knots with a bounded number of crossings according to the equivalence relation of being almost mutant .",
    "we worked out these equivalence classes for all knots with at most @xmath23 crossings . as it turns out",
    ", almost mutant knots with at most 16 crossings always have the same number or crossings . as a consequence ,",
    "two such knots are either both alternating or both non - alternating .",
    "this follows from the fact that the span of the jones polynomial of a knot equals the number of crossings for this knot if and only if the knot is alternating . for non - alternating knots ,",
    "table  [ table : am_classes ] lists the number of such equivalence classes of a given size .",
    "we restrict the table to non - alternating knots only because we are interested primarily in the possibilities for the khovanov homology of almost mutant pairs ; for alternating knots , the khovanov homology ( at least the free part thereof ) is completely determined by their jones polynomials and signature  @xcite .",
    "the number of knots in table  [ table : am_classes ] is taken from knotscape , which does not distinguish between mirror images .",
    "therefore , we considered each knot twice : the knot itself and its mirror image . the number of amphicheiral knots can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the notation @xmath102 means that there are @xmath103 equivalence classes of size @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "we used knotscape  @xcite to list all almost mutant knots with at most 16 crossings .",
    "khovanov homology was computed using khoho  @xcite for all knots with at most 15 crossings and javakh  @xcite for non - alternating knots with 16 crossings .",
    "it is worth noticing that knotscape only computes hyperbolic volume with the precision of 12 significant digits .",
    "we used program snap  @xcite to compute the volume with the precision of 180 significant digits to verify our data . as it turns out ,",
    "there are no knots with at most 16 crossings that have non - zero difference in hyperbolic volumes that is less than @xmath106 .",
    "only 132 pairs of knots have difference in volumes less than @xmath107 and , hence , are considered as having the same volume by knotscape .",
    "none of these pairs are almost mutants .    to end this section we list values of some quantum and hyperbolic invariants for the almost mutant knots with at most 15 crossings that have different khovanov homology .",
    "they were computed using knotscape  @xcite and khoho  @xcite .",
    "homfly - pt and kauffman polynomials are given by the tables of their coefficients .",
    "our notation for khovanov homology is borrowed from  @xcite .",
    "an expression @xmath108 in the `` ranks '' string means that the multiplicity of @xmath109 in the khovanov homology group with homological grading @xmath110 and @xmath111-grading @xmath112 is @xmath76 .",
    "negative grading is shown with underlined numbers .",
    "a similar convention is used for @xmath26-torsion as well ( this is the only torsion that appears for these knots ) . in this case , @xmath76 is the multiplicity of @xmath113 .",
    "for example , the homology group of @xmath22 with homological grading @xmath114 and @xmath111-grading @xmath115 is @xmath116 ."
