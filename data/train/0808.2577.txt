    ", it had been clear that the theory of stochastic processes has important applications in electronics and communications , for the basic understanding of devices such as vacuum tubes and , later , solid state diodes and transistors as well as for the behavior of cable and wireless communication systems . in particular , it turned out that noise can be described in terms by equations like the following one @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the current produced by an electron reaching the anode of a vacuum tube at time @xmath2 , the @xmath3-th electron arrives at a random time @xmath4 and the series ( [ shotnoise ] ) is supposed to converge .",
    "s.o . rice gave an account of the early developments in a bell labs monograph published in 1944 @xcite .",
    "rice considers the example of the so - called random telegraph noise ( rtn ) or random telegraph signal ( rts ) , a stationary dichotomous noise where a current or a voltage randomly flips between two levels @xmath5 as shown in fig . 1 and flip events follow a poisson process .",
    "an early treatment of random telegraph signals can be found in kenrick s paper of 1929 @xcite . according to rice , kenrick was one of the first authors to use correlogram methods to compute the power spectrum of a signal @xmath6 .",
    "this was done by first obtaining the autocorrelation function @xmath7 ) ( x(t+\\delta t ) - \\mathbb{e } [ x(t+\\delta t)])],\\ ] ] where @xmath8 $ ] denotes the expected value of the random variable @xmath9 . based on results by wiener , khintchin and cramr , it is possible to show that",
    ", for a stationary signal when @xmath10 only depends on the lag @xmath11 , the power spectrum is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xcite : @xmath12 for rts with @xmath13 and unitary average waiting time ( a.k.a .",

    "a complete survey of the literature on rts and its applications is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , it is interesting to remark that rts has been used to explain 1/@xmath16 noise in electronic devices .",
    "indeed , a. mc whorter showed that an appropriate superposition of lorentzian spectra for rtss of different average duration gives 1/@xmath16 noise @xcite .",
    "more recently , p. allegrini _ et al . _ studied non - poisson dichotomous noise @xcite .",
    "their paper is particularly relevant here , as a particular case of non - poisson dichotomous noise is studied below in some detail , namely a generalized rts where waiting times between consecutive level changes follow a mittag - leffler distribution .",
    "this particular process never reaches a stationary state in finite time and , for this reason , standard spectral methods fail to properly represent its properties .    our paper is organized as follows . in section ii ,",
    "devoted to theory , the stationary case is briefly reviewed . then some tools are introduced taken from renewal theory .",
    "these methods lead to a general formula for the autocovariance function of a generalized rts .",

    "the generalized rts is not a time - homogeneous ( stationary ) random process and the autocovariance function does depend on the initial time of evaluation . in particular , one gets @xmath71= a^2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } ( -1)^n p(n,\\delta t ; t).\\ ] ] equation ( [ autocorrns ] ) is a consequence of the fact that , in the time interval between @xmath2 and @xmath47 , with probability @xmath40 , there can be an arbitrary , but finite , integer number @xmath26 of renewal events where the process of amplitude @xmath72 changes sign . as @xmath40 is available from equations ( [ distribution2 ] ) , ( [ renewalequation ] ) and ( [ lifetimedistribution ] ) , in principle , one can compute the _ time dependent _ autocovariance from the knowledge of the distribution of waiting times .",
    "however , the use of convolutions is painful and some analytical progress is possible by means of the method of laplace transforms . given a sufficiently well - behaved ( generalized ) function @xmath73 with non - negative support , the laplace transform is given by @xmath74 ( a generalized function is a distribution in the sense of sobolev and schwartz @xcite ) .    here , the method of the double laplace transform described by cox turns out to be very useful @xcite .",

    "this is not the case for the renewal process of mittag - leffler type where @xmath84 ( and @xmath85 ) . in other words ,",
    "all the rtss following a renewal process with @xmath86<\\infty$ ] reach a _ stationary state _ after an initial non - stationary transient ; in this stationary state , the autocovariance does no longer depend on @xmath2 .",

    "let us consider the case @xmath43 .",
    "equation ( [ autocorrns ] ) simplifies to @xmath87 using the laplace transform of the mittag - leffler survival function ( [ ml ] ) @xmath88 and of the corresponding density function @xmath89 @xcite , one gets : @xmath90 this laplace transform can be inverted to yield @xmath91 for @xmath92 this formula reduces to @xmath93 indeed , equation ( [ autocorrrts ] ) can be directly derived for a rts with intensity @xmath94 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath95 , therefore from equation ( [ autocorrml0 ] ) one gets @xmath96 thus , equation ( [ autocorrml0an ] ) coincides with the autocovariance function for the usual rts when @xmath64 .",
    "the essential ingredient for monte carlo simulation of a rts of mittag - leffler type is the generation of mittag - leffler deviates .",
    "an efficient transformation method has been thoroughly discussed in @xcite based on the theory of geometric stable distributions @xcite .",
    "mittag - leffler distributed random numbers can be obtained using the following formula @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath76 and @xmath98 are real random numbers uniformly distributed in @xmath99 . for @xmath92",

    "once a method for generating mittag - leffler deviates is available , the monte carlo simulation of an uncoupled ctrws is straightforward .",
    "it is sufficient to generate a sequence of @xmath101 independent and identically distributed waiting times @xmath102 until their sum is greater than @xmath2 . then the last waiting time can be discarded and @xmath103 alternate signs are generated .",

    "for each of 10000 values of @xmath11 , @xmath112 values of the product @xmath113 have been produced .",

    "the derivation of such equations is based on renewal theory . the analytical result in equation ( [ autocorrns ] )",
    "is then successfully compared to monte carlo simulations .",
    "an important feature of a rts of mittag - leffler type is that the renewal density @xmath50 of the mittag - leffler renewal process vanishes for @xmath82 for @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the hypoteses of the renewal theorem are not satisfied and the stationary regime is never reached . therefore ,",
    "contrary to other renewal processes , such as the weibull process , that , after a transient , become stationary , the renewal process of mittag - leffler type is non - stationary also if it is observed far from its beginning . in particular , standard spectral methods fail to describe the features of the rts of mittag - leffler type .",
    "these considerations may be useful when studying the origin of 1/@xmath16 noise , a problem not addressed here but which will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "indeed , the renewal process of mittag - leffler type can be described as an infinite mixture of exponential distributions , for instance , one has for the survival function @xmath117 where @xmath118 therefore , based on the ideas developed in @xcite , one already expects to have a power spectrum following a power law .",
