    "statistical thermodynamics is usually intended as the study of n - body systems at equilibrium .",
    "however only a few textbooks @xcite state clearly that the validity of equilibrium ensembles as models of thermodynamics is not automatically granted , but depends crucially on the nature of the hamiltonian of the n - body system . in particular the very same basic postulate of equilibrium statistical mechanics , the famous _ boltzmann principle _ @xmath0 of _ microcanonical ensemble _ , assumes that dynamics can be automatically ( and kind of easily ) taken into account .",
    "however this is not always justified @xcite . on the other hand , the boltzmann - gibbs _ canonical ensemble _ , is valid only for sufficiently short - range interactions and does not necessarily apply for example to gravitational or unscreened coulombian fields for which the usually assumed entropy additivity postulate is not valid @xcite . in general , a series of thermodynamic anomalies @xcite , which seem to escape a common general framework of understanding , has been observed .",
    "a few years ago , a generalized thermodynamics formalism based on a nonextensive entropy formula was proposed @xcite .",
    "the latter has been encountering a large number of successful applications in far - from - equilibrium situations , as for example , to cite only a few cases among the most recent ones , in plasma physics @xcite , heavy - ion collisions @xcite , turbulence @xcite , discrete maps @xcite and even in interdisciplinary fields such as bio - physics @xcite and linguistics @xcite .",
    "such a formalism is the best candidate to be the general framework for a thermodynamics when long - range correlations or fractal structures in phase space are important and time evolution is not trivial , in other words when _ the dynamics plays a non trivial role _ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of relaxation to equilibrium in a hamiltonian system of classical spins with infinite range interactions @xcite .",
    "we show that , for some values of the initial energy and a class of off - equilibrium initial conditions , the systems does not relax to the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium , but exhibits different equilibrium properties characterized by non - gaussian velocity distributions which can be fitted by the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of nonextensive thermodyamics@xcite . the present study , together with the results presented in a paper now in press @xcite , provide the first indication that the generalized nonextensive thermodynamics can be a good candidate to explain some of the anomalies found in hamiltonian systems with long - range interactions .",
    "the model , usually called hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) , consists of n planar classical spins interacting through an infinite - range potential @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath1~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the @xmath3 angle and @xmath4 the conjugate variable representing the rotational velocity .",
    "note that the summation in v is extended to all couples of spins and not restricted to first neighbors .",
    "following tradition , the coupling constant in the potential is divided by n. this makes h only formally extensive , i.e. @xmath5 when @xmath6@xcite , since the energy remains non - additive , that is _ the system can not be trivially divided in two independent sub - systems_. the model has an order parameter which is the magnetization m , i.e. the modulus of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 $ ] . the canonical analytical solution of the model predicts a second - order phase transition from a low - energy ferromagnetic phase with magnetization @xmath9 , to a high - energy one , where the spins are homogeneously oriented on the unit circle and @xmath10 .",
    "the dependence of the energy density @xmath11 on the temperature @xmath12 , usually called the _ caloric curve _ , is given by @xcite @xmath13    the critical point is at energy density @xmath14 corresponding to a critical temperature @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of hmf can be investigated by starting the system with out - of - equilibrium initial conditions and integrating numerically the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "in particular in refs .",
    "@xcite we have adopted water bag ( wb ) initial conditions , i.e. @xmath16 for all @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and velocities uniformly distributed . in a special region of energy values ( @xmath19 )",
    "the results of the simulations show , for a transient regime which depends on the system size , a disagreement with the canonical ensemble . in this region the dynamics",
    "is characterized by lvy walks and anomalous diffusion , while in correspondence the system shows a negative specific heat @xcite .",
    "ensemble inequivalence and negative specific heat have also been found in self - gravitating systems @xcite , nuclei and atomic clusters @xcite , though in the present model such anomalies emerge as dynamical features @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on a particular energy value belonging to the anomalous region , namely @xmath20 , and we study the time evolution of temperature , magnetization , velocity distributions .    in fig.1 we report the time evolution of @xmath21 , a quantity that coincides with the temperature ( @xmath22 denotes time averages ) .",
    "the system , started with wb initial conditions , rapidly reaches a metastable quasi - stationary state ( qss ) which does not coincide with the canonical prediction .",
    "in fact , after a short transient time , @xmath21 assumes a fixed value ( the plateau in figure ) corresponding to a n - dependent temperature @xmath23 lower than the canonical prediction , also reported . in correspondence of this plateau one",
    "gets for the magnetization a value @xmath24 .",
    "if we want to observe relaxation to the canonical equilibrium state with temperature @xmath25 and magnetization @xmath26 , we have to wait for a time longer than that shown in fig.1 , as shown for example in fig.2 for the case @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the following scaling relations have been found :    _ ( i ) _ the duration of the plateau , the lifetime of the qss @xmath28 , increases as @xmath29 ;    _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath30 , a value obtained analytically as the metastable prolongation , at energies below @xmath31 , of the high - energy solution ( @xmath32 ) as @xmath33 \\propto n^{-1/3}$ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 ( see fig.1(c ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these numerical results clearly indicate that    * _ the two limits , the infinite - time limit ( itl ) @xmath35 and the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) @xmath36 do not commute _ ; * _ if the tl is performed before the itl , the system does not relax to the bg equilibrium _ and lives forever in the qss .    the robustness of the above results was checked in two different ways : 1 ) by adopting different initial conditions , as for example double water bag ( dwb ) initial conditions , and checking that we get the same qss ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) ; 2 ) by changing the level of accuracy of the numerical integration , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "we expect these results to be ubiquitous in nonextensive systems as conjectured in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fig.3 we study the velocity pdfs .",
    "the initial velocity pdfs ( wb or dwb initial conditions ) quickly acquire and maintain during the entire duration of the metastable state a _ non - gaussian shape_. in figs.3(b ) and ( c ) we see that the pdfs of the qss do not change up to a time @xmath37 for a system with @xmath38 . the velocity pdf of the qss is wider than a gaussian for small velocities , but shows a faster decrease for @xmath39 . the enhancement for velocities around @xmath40 is consistent with the anomalous diffusion and the lvy walks observed in the qss regime @xcite .",
    "the following rapid decrease for @xmath39 is due to conservation of total energy . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", the stability of the qss velocity pdf can be explained by the fact that , for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and thus the force on the spins @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "when n is finite , we have always a small random force , whose strength depends on n , which makes the system eventually evolve into the usual maxwell - boltzmann distribution after some time .",
    "we show this for n=1000 at time t=500000 in fig.3(d ) . when this happens , lvy walks disappear and anomalous diffusion leaves place to brownian diffusion @xcite .",
    "we fit the non - gaussian pdf in fig.3(b ) by using the one - particle prescription of the generalized thermodynamics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) : @xmath44^ { 1/(1-q ) }   .\\ ] ] this formula recovers the maxwell - boltzmann distribution for @xmath45 and has been recently used to describe successfully turbulence @xcite and non - gaussian pdfs related to anomalous diffusion of _ hydra _ cells in cellular aggregates @xcite . in our case , the best fit is obtained by a curve with @xmath46 , @xmath47 as shown in fig .",
    "the agreement between numerical results and theoretical curve improves with the size of the system . a finite - size scaling confirming the validity of the fit",
    "is reported in the inset , where @xmath48 , the difference between the theoretical points and the numerical ones , is shown to go to zero as a power of n ( for four values of @xmath49 ) . since @xmath50",
    ", the theoretical curve does not have a finite integral and therefore it needs to be truncated with a sharp cut - off ( herein assumed to be discontinuous for simplicity ) to make the total probability equal to one .",
    "it is however clear that , the fitting value @xmath46 is only an effective nonextensive entropic index .",
    "although similar non - gaussian pdfs have been found previously , it was for dissipative systems @xcite , while this is the first evidence in a hamiltonian system .    in order to investigate deeper the dynamics of the plateaux observed in figs.1 and 2",
    ", we have studied the lyapunov exponent in the qss regime . in fig .",
    "5 we show that , as expected , the largest lyapunov exponent ( lle ) tends to zero when n increases .",
    "the scaling behaviour of the @xmath51 can be understood following the same argument already applied in ref.@xcite in the overcritical region .",
    "it is known in fact that , when the lyapunov can be estimated by the product of random matrices , the lle scales with the power 2/3 of the perturbation @xcite . in our case the perturbation is given by the magnetization , for which we have the scaling law @xmath52 in the qss regime @xcite , thus we get the scaling @xmath53 .",
    "the latter is in perfect agreement with the numerical results as shown in the figure . since lle tends to zero as the system is increasingly large",
    ", one can safely say that mixing is increasingly slower and the observed anomalies in the relaxation process are naturally expected in the sense predicted by krilov @xcite .",
    "we note finally that , emergence of dynamical correlations and filamentary sticky structures in the @xmath54-space have also been observed in the qss regime @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied a simple hamiltonian system with long - range interaction .",
    "the dynamics of relaxation process is extremely rich and the system shows the existence of qss different from the canonical equilibrium .",
    "these states satisfy the usual attributes of thermal equilibrium though they systematically differ from what bg statistical mechanics has made familiar to us .",
    "our results provide a first verification of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite in long - range hamiltonian systems , and illustrate the correctness of the criticism that einstein developed in his celebrated 1910 paper @xcite about the possible nonuniversality of boltzmann thermostatistics , and the need of providing a mechanical basis to it ( including naturally _ time _ in the discussion ) .",

    "complete _ ( molecular - mechanical ) theory of the system under consideration .",
    "therefore it is dubious whether the boltzmann principle has any meaning without a complete molecular - mechanical theory or some other theory which describes the elementary processes .",
