    "particle accelerators are an indispensable tool to explore the fundamental laws of nature and are widely used for medical and industrial applications . at the frontier of accelerator technology is the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a gigantic circular machine of 27 km total circumference @xcite .",
    "the need to control the size and cost of building such machines have kept alive the quest for alternative means to accelerate particles . over the past decade ,",
    "laser plasma - based acceleration has emerged as a promising candidate @xcite . in particular ,",
    "laser wakefield acceleration of electrons @xcite has undergone rapid development .",
    "stable and reproducible beams have been realized @xcite and particle kinetic energies at the gev level have been reached @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the creation of a plasma wave from interaction with a highly energetic electron beam as a driver allows for doubling the kinetic energy of the accelerated particles within a meter - scale plasma wakefield accelerator @xcite .",
    "the advent of quasi - static magnetic fields @xcite of durations up to seconds , with strengths as high as 100 tesla , suggests vacuum autoresonance laser acceleration ( ala ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) as a further potential alternative to conventional acceleration .",
    "the ala mechanism employs a static magnetic field oriented along the propagation direction of the laser .",
    "thus , the underlying concept of ala stems from the realization that an electron continues to absorb energy from a circularly polarized laser field if it is launched in cyclotron autoresonance with it . for the case of laser fields described by plane - waves",
    "@xcite resonance is essentially between the doppler - shifted laser frequency seen by the electron and the cyclotron frequency of the electron around the lines of the applied static magnetic field .",
    "feasibility of post - acceleration of electrons to kinetic energies of about three times their initial energies has also been theoretically investigated , employing continuous - wave co@xmath4 laser fields described within the paraxial approximation @xcite .     and",
    "the velocity vector @xmath5 , to 50  mev and a magnetic field @xmath6 bends its trajectory slightly for injection axial to the combination of incident laser pulse and axial uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath7.,width=302 ]    in this paper , the ala configuration ( see fig . [ schematic ] ) is investigated over a wide range of laser and magnetic field parameters .",
    "our results , stemming from single- and many - particle calculations which employ pulsed and focused laser fields , indicate electron energy gains of several hundred ( even thousand ) times the initial injection energy . for magnetic field strengths below 60  tesla , energy gains in excess of 10  gev",
    "are shown to be possible .",
    "it is shown that the gains are attained over distances less than 10  m , and from a near - infrared laser system of peak intensity @xmath8  w/@xmath2 ( peak power @xmath3  pw ) .",
    "many - particle simulations also demonstrate that an electron bunch of high quality ( relative energy spread on the @xmath0 level ) may be obtained , taking coulomb particle - particle repulsions into account in simulations at densities of @xmath9  @xmath10 .",
    "gains in excess of 100  gev are also shown to be possible anticipating a 200-pw laser system , like it might be realized by the extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by currently feasible magnetic fields of strength of the order of 100 tesla @xcite and anticipates continued progress in high magnetic field research .",
    "classical electron motion in the presence of electromagnetic fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 is governed by the lorentz - newton equations of motion , namely ,    @xmath13    which describe time evolution of the particle s relativistic momentum @xmath14 and energy @xmath15 , respectively . in the above",
    ", @xmath16 is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and @xmath17 is its rest mass , @xmath18 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath19 is the particle s velocity scaled by @xmath18 , @xmath20 and si units are used throughout .",
    "results to be presented below are based on solving these equations numerically for single- and many - particle systems . in the solutions ,",
    "the electron is assumed to be overcome by the front of the pulse at @xmath21 at the origin of a coordinate system whose @xmath22axis is oriented along the direction of pulse propagation .    in earlier calculations of autoresonance acceleration the laser fields",
    "were modeled as plane - waves of infinite extension in space and time @xcite , or as those of a continuous beam within the paraxial approximation @xcite .",
    "the plane - wave - based calculations have led to the realization of the resonance condition , to be recalled below , and have shown that an electron stands to gain more energy from circularly polarized light than from light of the linear polarization variety .",
    "recall that the polarization vector of a circularly polarized plane wave rotates about the direction of propagation at the angular frequency of the wave , while its field strength remains constant .",
    "thus , if the initial conditions are such that the electron cyclotron frequency matches the doppler - shifted frequency ( sensed by the electron ) of the circularly polarized fields , the electron will subsequently _ surf _ on the wave and continue to absorb energy from it .",
    "hence , calculations in this paper will employ circularly polarized laser fields , obtained by the superposition of two linearly polarized fields , with perpendicular polarization vectors and a @xmath23-phase difference @xcite .",
    "a pulse shape is introduced by multiplying the fields by the gaussian envelope @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the phase variable , @xmath26 is the wavenumber , @xmath27 is the envelope s full - width - at - half - maximum , and @xmath28 is the pulse duration ( temporal full - width - at - half - maximum ) . for the field amplitudes , a generalized lax series representation ( in powers of the diffraction angle @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the beam s waist radius at focus ) will be adopted @xcite .",
    "thus , the fields of the ala scheme may be written as ( see @xcite for definitions of the symbols and more details )    @xmath31+\\left[e_y\\hat{\\bm{e}}_y+e'_y\\hat{\\bm{e}}_x\\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\            & &    \\left.+\\left[e_z+e'_z\\right]\\hat{\\bm{e}}_z\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath32\\right.\\nonumber\\\\           & & \\left.+\\left[b_z - b'_z\\right]\\hat{\\bm{e}}_z\\right\\}+b_s\\hat{\\bm{e}}_z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the primed components follow from the unprimed ones by letting @xmath33 and adding a phase - shift of @xmath34 .",
    "to decide the order of the correction terms , beyond the paraxial approximation , which ought to be retained in the various field expressions , simulations have been performed for a single electron injected axially with 50 mev initial kinetic energy .",
    "the electron s exit energy gain as a function of the pulse waist radius at focus has been analyzed , when terms up to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , are employed in modeling the laser fields ( see fig .",
    "[ order ] ) .",

    "introduction of a pulse - shape and a tight focus is expected to modify the resonance condition ( [ condition ] ) and render it approximate at best , thus leading to a slight deterioration in the electron - beam quality . to investigate this issue ,",

    "the plot shows clearly a region in parameter space for which the exit energy gain is optimal .",
    "the exit energy gain is not sensitive to small fluctuations in the ala configuration parameters .",
    "for example , an energy gain of about 11  gev may be realized for waist radii @xmath30 in the range extending roughly from 950@xmath53 to 1750@xmath53 and a magnetic field strength @xmath7 in the approximate range 1.04 @xmath52 to 1.13@xmath52 .",
    "the maximum energy gain of 12.5  gev is reached for @xmath54 t. recent progress in quasi - static magnetic field research has achieved 45 t @xcite over a distance of 0.225  m. thus , the 58 t goal may not be too far - fetched , and the need to have such a magnetic field strength over 25 m may , in principle , be met by employing an assembly of such magnets .",

    "one second would require an average power consumption of 2.25 gw @xcite .",
    "however , a petawatt laser provides its energy in a pulsed way , such that we do not need to continuously maintain the magnetic field which will significantly lower the average energy consumption as we will show subsequently .",
    "for one relativistic electron bunch at approx . the speed of light it takes about 33.3 ns to travel 10 m and , hence , for ten bunches about 0.3 @xmath55s .",
    "this implies that at a laser repetition rate of 10 shots per second the energy consumption of the ala scheme corresponds to only 0.7 kj based on pulsed magnets . since this value does not include the power consumption of the laser system and the linac , it exceeds in total the power consumption of laser wakefield accelerators @xcite .",
    "moreover , we want to emphasize that this estimate is based on the assumptions that the magnets are able to operate at such short pulses and their power consumption scales linearly with the magnets pulse duration , which might be influenced by the presence of pedestals .     and @xmath56 .",

    "after an initial ( approximately linear ) increase , the energy gain starts to saturate with increasing excursion .",

    "the transverse beam emittance amounts to @xmath73 @xmath74 mm mrad which compares well with what is obtained from conventional accelerators @xcite .",

    "a conventional particle - in - cell scheme describes the interaction of a laser with an initially neutral plasma , and is not applicable over macroscopic distances of several meters .",
    "therefore , further simulations have been performed employing a 1000-particle ensemble confined to a spatial volume similar to what has been used above , but scaled to render the particle density the same as would be obtained from a @xmath79-particle bunch ( typical in conventional particle accelerators @xcite ) with the coulomb interactions turned on @xcite and off .",
