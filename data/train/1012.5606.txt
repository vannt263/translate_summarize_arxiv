    "it is well known that principle of linear superposition can not be applied to generate new exact solutions to _ nonlinear _ partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "thus , the classical methods ( the fourier method , the method of the laplace transformations , and so forth ) are not applicable for solving nonlinear pdes .",
    "while there is no existing general theory for integrating nonlinear pdes , construction of particular exact solutions for these equations is a non - trivial and important problem . now",
    "the most popular methods for construction of exact solutions to non - integrable nonlinear pdes are the lie , lie - bcklund and conditional symmetry methods @xcite .",
    "although these methods are very powerful provided the relevant symmetry is known , several other approaches for solving non - integrable nonlinear pdes were independently suggested during the last decades . among them",
    "the method of compatible differential constraints @xcite , the method of linear invariant subspaces @xcite , @xmath3-method and its various modifications @xcite , the method of additional generating conditions @xcite , and the transformed rational function method @xcite should be marked out ( see , e.g. , supplements in @xcite about other methods ) .",
    "the lie symmetries are widely applied to study nonlinear differential equations ( including multi - component systems of pdes ) since 60-s of the last century , notably , for constructing their exact solutions .",
    "nevertheless there are a huge number of papers and many excellent books ( see , e.g. , @xcite and papers cited therein ) devoted to such applications , one may note that a very small number of them involve lie symmetries to solve boundary value problems for the given pdes . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first papers in this directions were published in the beginning of 1970-s @xcite and @xcite ( the extended versions of these papers are presented in books @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the books , which highlight essential role of lie symmetries in solving boundary value problems ( bvps ) and present several examples , were published only in 1989 @xcite .",
    "the main object of this paper is a nonlinear bvp of stefan type , which belongs to the class of bvps with free ( moving ) boundaries .",
    "boundary value problems of stefan type are widely used in mathematical modeling a huge number of processes , which arise in physics , biology and industry @xcite .",
    "nevertheless these processes can be very different from formal point of view , they have the common peculiarity , unknown moving boundaries .",
    "movement of unknown boundaries are described by famous stefan boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that exact solutions of bvps of stefan type can be derived only in exceptional cases and the relevant list is rather short at the present time ( see @xcite and papers cited therein )",
    ".    nevertheless bvps with free boundaries are more complicated objects than the standard bvps with the fixed boundaries , it can be noted that the lie symmetry method should be more applicable just for solving problems with moving boundaries .",
    "in fact , the structure of such boundaries may depend on invariant variable(s ) and this gives a possibility to reduce the given bvp to that of lover dimensionality .",
    "this is the reason why different authors applied the lie symmetry method to bvps with free boundaries ignoring bvps with fixed boundaries @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss the existing definitions of lie invariance for bvps and propose their generalization on much wider class of bvps . as an example the direct application of the definition for the well - known bvp with the fixed boundaries is presented . in section 3",
    ", we apply the definition derived to the class of ( 1 + 1)dimensional bvps of stefan type used to describe melting and evaporation of materials in the case when their surface is exposed to a powerful flux of energy @xcite .",
    "the result obtained is an essential generalization of paper @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "we reduce the problem to bvps for ordinary differential equations , using lie symmetry operators obtained in the previous section .",
    "an example how to construct exact solution of the problem with correctly - specified coefficients is also presented .",
    "finally , we present conclusions in the last section .",
    "we start from a definition of invariance of a bvp under the given infinitesimal operator presented in @xcite and restrict ourselves on the case when the basic equation of bvp is an ( 1 + 1)dimensional evolution pde of @xmath4th  order ( @xmath5 ) . in this case",
    "the relevant bvp may be formulated as follows : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are smooth functions in the corresponding domains , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are a domain with smooth boundaries and smooth curves , respectively .",
    "hereafter the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote differentiation with respect to these variables , @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that bvp ( [ ad-1 ] ) and ( [ ad-2 ] ) has a classical solution ( in a usual sense ) .",
    "consider the infinitesimal generator @xmath15 ( hereafter @xmath16 and @xmath17 are known smooth functions ) , which defines a lie symmetry acting on both @xmath18space as well as on its projection to @xmath19space .",
    "let @xmath20 be the @xmath4th  prolongation of the generator @xmath21 calculated by the well - known prolongation formulae ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite the lie symmetry @xmath21 of the form ( [ ad-3 ] ) is admitted by the boundary value problem ( [ ad-1 ] ) and ( [ ad-2 ] ) if and only if :    * @xmath22 when @xmath23 satisfies ( [ ad-1 ] ) ; * @xmath24 when @xmath25 ; * @xmath26 when @xmath27 ,  @xmath28 .",
    "the definition can straightforwardly be extended on bvps for a system of pdes .",
    "however , one easily notes that this definition can not be applied to bvps with free boundaries , because such problems contain moving surfaces , say @xmath29 where @xmath30 are unknown functions .",
    "obviously , these functions should be interpreted as additional variables . in @xcite",
    "( see appendix 2 ) , a criteria of invariance for bvp with a free boundary was formulated .",
    "another deficiency of definition 1 appears if one consider bvps in the unbounded domain @xmath10 when the boundary conditions for @xmath31 arise .",
    "in fact , item ( b ) has no sense in this case and can not be replaced by the natural passage to the limit , i.e. , @xmath32 probably this deficiency for the first time was noted in @xcite ( see section 4.3 ) where the transformation @xmath33 was suggested to avoid the non - regular manifold generated by @xmath31 .",
    "now we present a definition which takes into account all possible boundary conditions and is applicable to a wide range of bvps .",
    "consider a bvp for a system of @xmath34 evolution equations ( @xmath35 ) with @xmath36 independent @xmath37 and @xmath34 dependent @xmath38 variables .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath4th  order ( @xmath39 ) basic equations of evolution type @xmath40 are defined on a domain @xmath41 with smooth boundaries .",
    "consider three types of boundary and initial conditions , which can arise in applications : @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the given numbers , @xmath11 and @xmath47 are the known functions , while the functions @xmath30 defining free boundary surfaces must be found .",
    "we assume that all functions arising in ( [ 1])([4 ] ) are sufficiently smooth so that a classical solution exists for this bvp .",
    "consider an @xmath48parameter ( local ) lie group @xmath49 of point transformations of variables @xmath18 in the euclidean space @xmath50 ( open subset of @xmath50 ) , which is given by equations @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the group parameters .",
    "according to the general lie group theory , one may construct the corresponding @xmath48dimensional lie algebra @xmath53 with the basic generators @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "consider the lie algebra @xmath53 in the extended space @xmath56 of the variables @xmath57 , where @xmath58 are new dependent variables with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in the extended space @xmath56 , the lie group @xmath59 corresponding to this algebra is given by transformations @xmath60 now we propose a new definition , which is based on the standard definition of differential equation invariance as an invariant manifold @xmath61 in the relevant space of variables and on the prolongation theory @xcite .",
    "a boundary value problem ( [ 1])([4 ] ) is called to be invariant with respect to the lie group @xmath59 ( [ 7 ] ) if :    * the manifold determined by eqs . ( [ 1 ] ) in the space of variables @xmath62 is invariant with respect to the @xmath4th  order prolongation of the group @xmath49 ; * each manifold determined by conditions ( [ 2 ] ) with any fixed number @xmath63 is invariant with respect to the @xmath64th  order prolongation of the group @xmath49 in the space of variables @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ; * each manifold determined by conditions ( [ 3 ] ) with any fixed number @xmath67 is invariant with respect to the @xmath68th  order prolongation of the group @xmath59 in the space of variables @xmath69 , where @xmath70 ; * each manifold determined by conditions ( [ 4 ] ) with any fixed number @xmath71 is invariant with respect to the @xmath72th  order prolongation of the group @xmath49 in the space of variables @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .    the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 form an invariant solution of bvp ( [ 1])([4 ] ) corresponding to the lie group ( [ 7 ] ) if :    * the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfy equations ( [ 1])([4 ] ) ; * the manifold @xmath79 is an invariant manifold of the lie group ( [ 7 ] ) .    definition 2 can be generalized on more general systems ( including hyperbolic and elliptic those ) and boundary conditions containing high - order derivatives for @xmath30 .",
    "if free boundaries are given in the form @xmath80 , where @xmath81 then we simply take @xmath82 . on the other hand , one can formulate a definition of lie invariance for bvps with such form of the free boundaries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the form used in definition 2 is more convenient for generalization on multidimensional bvps .",
    "now we present a non - trivial result to illustrate definition 2 .",
    "let us consider the nonlinear bvp modeling the heat transfer in semi - infinite solid rod assuming that thermal diffusivity depends on temperature and the rod is exposed to a periodical flux of energy at the left endpoint .",
    "it should be noted that we neglect the initial distribution of the temperature in the rod , i.e. , consider the process on the stage when the heat transfer already started .",
    "thus the nonlinear bvp reads as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an unknown temperature field , @xmath85 is a thermal diffusivity coefficient , @xmath86 is an energy flux .",
    "we assume that all functions arising in ( [ 8])([11 ] ) are sufficiently smooth , so that a classical solution exists for this bvp .    here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the thermal diffusivity coefficient depends on the temperature as a power low , i.e. @xmath87 , where @xmath88 ( in the case @xmath89 , the problem is liner and can be solved by classical methods , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notably , equation ( [ 8 ] ) with @xmath87 presents the most interesting cases of lie symmetry invariance @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath87 ( @xmath90 @xmath91 ) , it admits a four - dimensional lie group . the corresponding algebra @xmath92 possesses the basic operators @xmath93 .",
    "these operators generate the one - parameter lie groups @xmath94 respectively ( hereafter @xmath95 are arbitrary group parameters ) . if @xmath96 , then the additional conformal generator @xmath97 occurs , which extends @xmath92 to the five - dimensional lie algebra @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the case @xmath96 should be examined separately .",
    ".lie invariance of bvp ( [ 8])([11 ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) with any smooth functions @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 is invariant under the one - parameter lie group presented in case 1 of table 3 .",
    "all possible extensions of this lie group invariance ( up to equivalent representations generated by equivalence transformations of the form ( [ 40 ] ) ) depend only on the form of the functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and are presented in cases 2 and 3 of table 3 .",
    "any other bvp of the form ( [ 34])([38 ] ) is invariant under two - parameter lie group is reduced by transformations ( [ 40 ] ) to one of those with the functions @xmath102 and @xmath104 from table 3 .",
    "* proof*. according to definition 2 and theorem 2 we need to examine the nine different cases listed in table 2 .",
    "it turns out that the examination of the first case , when the functions @xmath99 and @xmath105 are arbitrary , leads to the main result of the theorem presented in table 3 .",
    "let us consider the one - parameter lie groups corresponding to the basic operators of algebra @xmath106 .",
    "obviously , bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) with arbitrary given functions is invariant under the group of space translations generated by the operator @xmath107 and this is listed in the first case of table 3 . since any linear combination @xmath108 of other two operators is equivalent ( up to transformations ( [ 40 ] ) ) either to @xmath109 ( if @xmath110 ) or to @xmath111 ( if @xmath112 ) , we should separately examine these two operators .",
    "now we apply definition 2 to @xmath113 .",
    "taking into account that bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) has two free boundaries , we construct the extended lie group @xmath114 corresponding to the operator @xmath113 : @xmath115 according to item ( c ) , the boundary conditions ( [ 36 ] ) are invariant with respect to the group @xmath114 , if the manifold @xmath116 satisfies the conditions @xmath117 taking into account ( [ 42 ] ) , one finds @xmath118 so that the second and third equations of ( [ 43 ] ) produce the equations @xmath119 to find the functions @xmath102 and @xmath104 . solving ( [ 45 ] )",

    "the invariance criterium of the boundary conditions ( [ 37 ] ) for @xmath114 is fulfilled for arbitrary parameters arising in ( [ 37 ] ) , while the invariance of condition ( [ 38 ] ) under @xmath123 is obvious .",
    "thus , bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) is invariant with respect to the lie group @xmath114 if and only if restrictions ( [ 46 ] ) take place .",
    "this is exactly listed in case 3 of table 3 .    in a quite similar way one can show ,",
    "that the bvp under study is invariant with respect to the extended lie group corresponding to the operator @xmath109 if and only if the restrictions on @xmath124 take place , and this is what exactly listed in case 2 of table 3 .",
    "much more cumbersome calculations are needed to show that there are no any new lie group invariance for bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) nevertheless there are eight special cases listed in table 2 , which lead to the extensions of mai of the basic equations ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "let us consider case 2 of table 2 .",
    "firstly , we check the invariance of bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) with respect to the one - parameter extended lie groups corresponding to the operators @xmath125 and @xmath126 : @xmath127 and @xmath128 according to item ( c ) of definition 2 , the boundary conditions ( [ 37 ] ) are invariant with respect to the group @xmath129 , if the conditions @xmath130 are satisfied , where the manifold @xmath131 taking into account ( [ d1 ] ) and the second equation of ( [ d3 ] ) , we arrive at the requirement @xmath132 similarly , one easily checks that the boundary conditions ( [ 37 ] ) is nt invariant with respect to the lie group @xmath133 , too . indeed , to satisfy the third equation of ( [ d3 ] ) , one obtains the requirement @xmath134    let us now examine the invariance of bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) with respect to an extended lie group @xmath135 corresponding to a liner combination of operators @xmath136 , @xmath113 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , i.e. @xmath139 where @xmath140 are arbitrary parameters and @xmath141 ( otherwise the operator @xmath142 is obtained ) . having transformations ( [ 40 ] ) , we can put @xmath143 and @xmath144 in ( [ d6 ] ) so that the operator takes the form @xmath145 the corresponding lie group @xmath135 is @xmath146 now we again show that boundary conditions ( [ 37 ] ) are not invariant under @xmath135 .",
    "in fact , the third equation of ( [ d3 ] ) gives the restriction @xmath147 so that the lie group @xmath135 can be written in the form @xmath148 taking into account ( [ d11 ] ) and the second equation of ( [ d3 ] ) , we arrive at the requirement @xmath149 what leads to @xmath150 ( see ( [ d10 ] ) ) .",
    "however , this contradicts to the assumption @xmath141 .",
    "hence , case 2 of table 2 is completely examined . cases 3 and 9 of table 2",
    "can be studied in a quite similar manner because each of them needs to examine groups ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "consider case 4 from table 2 . here",
    "the operator @xmath151 arises , which generates the extended lie group @xmath152 : @xmath153 applying definition 2 to the boundary conditions ( [ 37 ] ) in the case of @xmath152 , equations ( [ d3 ] ) are again obtained .",
    "the third and fourth equations of ( [ d3 ] ) lead to the requirement @xmath154 hence , @xmath155 .",
    "thus , bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) can not be invariant with respect to the lie group @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , the same result is obtained if one examines any linear combination of operators @xmath156 , @xmath113 , and @xmath157 , i.e. @xmath158 with @xmath159 .",
    "thus , we conclude , that the exponential diffusivities arising in case 4 of table 2 do nt lead to any new lie groups of invariance of bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) .",
    "cases 5 and 6 of table 2 can be studied in a quite similar way .",
    "let us consider case 7 of table 2 , which needs separate examination .",
    "the extended lie group @xmath160 corresponding to the operator @xmath161 is @xmath162    in order to the boundary conditions ( [ 37 ] ) be invariant under @xmath160 equations ( [ d3 ] ) are again obtained .",
    "it turns out , equations ( [ d3 ] ) are fulfilled if @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "hence , we must apply item ( d ) of definition 2 to the boundary conditions ( [ 38 ] ) : @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "the group @xmath160 transforms the second equation of ( [ 51 ] ) as follows @xmath167 hence , we arrive at the restriction @xmath168 ( otherwise @xmath169 ) .",
    "thus , the contradiction is obtained because , in the very beginning , we assumed @xmath170 .",
    "one may check that the same result is obtained for any liner combination of the operators @xmath136 , @xmath113 , and @xmath171 .",
    "thus , case 7 of table 2 is completely examined .",
    "case 8 of table 2 can be treated in a quite similar way as we did in theorem 1 ( see formulae ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 22a ] ) ) .    the proof is now completed .",
    "@xmath172    finally , we note that theorem 2 from the recent paper @xcite follows as a particular case from theorem 3 ( but not wise versa ! ) , nevertheless definition 2 was not used in @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider symmetry reduction of bvps of the form ( [ 34])([38 ] ) to bvps for systems of two ordinary differential equations and construct exact solutions for the reduced bvps .",
    "operator @xmath173 , corresponding to the invariance transformations in case 1 of table 3 , leads to an ansatz , which does nt depend on the space variable @xmath13 .",
    "this contradicts to the free boundary surfaces and leads to non - physical solutions .",
    "according to case 2 of theorem 3 , each bvps belonging to the class under study for @xmath174 and @xmath175 admits the two - dimensional lie algebra with basic operators @xmath176 and @xmath107 .",
    "hence , it also admits the operator @xmath177 , which leads to the plane - wave ansatz @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath180 is an unknown velocity .",
    "note , that ansatz ( [ 4.1 ] ) with @xmath181 leads to stationary solutions of the bvp in question .",
    "however , these solutions do nt have essential physical sense so that will not studied hereafter .    in case 3 of table 3 , each bvp of the form ( [ 34])([38 ] ) admits two - dimensional lie algebra with basic operators @xmath173 and @xmath182 . obviously , that any linear combination of these operators is equivalent , up to transformations ( [ 40 ] ) , to operator @xmath113 , which generates the ansatz @xmath183    using anstze ( [ 4.1])([4.2 ] ) and taking into account the restrictions on the functions @xmath102 and @xmath104 ( see theorem 3 ) one can easy obtain the following theorems .",
    "ansatz ( [ 4.1 ] ) reduces any nonlinear bvp of the form ( [ 34])([38 ] ) with the coefficient restrictions @xmath174 and @xmath175 to the bvp for the second - order odes @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath180 are to be determined parameters .",

    "it means that the exact solution of bvp ( [ 4.3])([4.7 ] ) is obtained in implicit form .",
    "it should be stressed that this result is essential generalization of @xcite , where a particular case of bvp ( [ 34])([38 ] ) was investigated .",
    "* example .",
    "* we use a model , which was formulated and investigated by numerical methods in @xcite .",
    "the model describes the processes of heating , melting and evaporation of metals under the action at their surface of powerful laser pulses",
    ". under the relevant assumptions it can be written as follows @xcite @xmath214 where @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 are the known temperatures of evaporation ( under normal atmospheric pressure ) , melting and solid phase of metal , respectively ; @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 are the specific heat coefficients ( functions ) , which are typical for the given metal ( note , that we consider the model with constant and equal densities of solid and liquid phases of metal , i.e. , @xmath223 ) ; @xmath224 are the phase division boundary coordinates to be found ; @xmath225 are the phase division boundary velocities ; @xmath226 are the unknown temperature fields ; index @xmath227 corresponds to the liquid and solid phases , respectively .",
    "we will consider the processes of melting and evaporation under a long time powerful pulse , i.e. @xmath228 sec and more . in this case , the function @xmath229 determining the amount of the absorbed energy is defined by the formula @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the power of laser pulse , assumed to be a constant @xmath232 , and @xmath233 is the absorbtion coefficient of the energy .",
    "velocity @xmath234 , which is approximately equal velocity of sound in the metal , can be given by the formula @xcite @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the normal atmospheric pressure , @xmath106 is the atomic weight , @xmath237 is the universal gas constant .    since our aim is to demonstrate that the formulae obtained above produce realistic data , we need to specify all coefficients arising in bvp ( [ 4.32])([4.36 ] )",
    "thus , all coefficients were taken from the paper @xcite , where the processes of melting and evaporation of aluminium were studied . in the particular case , the temperature dependence of the quantities @xmath238 and @xmath239 are essential and have the form @xmath240 @xmath241 where @xmath242 = \\mbox{j } \\mbox{kg}^{-1 } \\mbox{k}^{-1}$ ] .",
