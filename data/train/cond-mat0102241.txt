    "apolar molecules are poorly soluble in water @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time that this is due , in many cases , not to an enthalpy , but to entropy effects : the dissolution in water of such molecules results in a decrease both in enthalpy ( which would lead to large solubility ) and in entropy , inspite of the disruption of the net of hydrogen bonds characteristic of water .",
    "this effect has been qualitatively explained quite some time ago @xcite in terms of an effect known as hydrophobic hydration : a tendency of the water molecules to `` strengthen '' their structure around the apolar molecules .",
    "hydrophobic interaction , leading to a tendency of aggregation of nonpolar solute , would also result .",
    "nmr and other experimental evidence @xcite is in favour of the hydration hypothesis .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of model water solutions with atomic detail have probed these ideas , but evidence is often contradictory @xcite and still not quite conclusive on which microscopic properties would be responsible for the lower entropy @xcite .",
    "the simulation of molecular models with atomic detail is restricted , by todays computer facilities , to short time simulations .",
    "simplified models are therefore an alternative tool . in a recently proposed very simple lattice model barkema and widom@xcite",
    "impose ordering on dissolution and analyse the effective solute interaction . in this paper",
    "we follow the more usual approach : we adopt a lattice model for the solvent and look for signs of induced structure around apolar solutes .",
    "the hydrogen bond network@xcite is thought to be responsible for other special properties of pure water such as a maximum in the density curve as a function of temperature . beyond condensation",
    "the tetrahedrally coordinated open ice structure is distorted retaining most of the hb network but accomodating some broken bonds and increasing slightly the number of nearest neighbours and thus the density @xcite . at higher temperatures ,",
    "usual expansion takes place , under increasing disrupture of the net @xcite .",
    "consideration of water with atomic detail has led to the development of a number of different models @xcite , all of which present some sort of discrepancy in relation to experimental thermodynamic or structural properties of liquid water . on the other hand , inumerous simplified statistical models",
    "@xcite have been proposed in the search for the main features which may explain the behaviour exhibited by this special liquid .",
    "square water is one of these models , whose properties were studied by nadler and krausche@xcite . probably due to its simple thermodynamic behaviour , in which no phase transition is present , it is scarcely mentioned in the literature as a model for water .",
    "square ice incorporates the hydrogen bond net but does not allow for distortions , neither for density fluctuations . thus the model is incapable of presenting anything like a liquid - ice transition .",
    "however , it could represent the net and its fluctuations under temperature characteristic of liquid water .",
    "rotations which lead to disrupture of a bond are considered in an extreme ( discrete ) form .",
    "we have undertaken to study the effect of such an associated model solvent @xcite on apolar solutes , both in comparison to non polar solvents , as well as in terms of the possible hydration effect .",
    "the pure and mixture models are defined in the following section .",
    "although presented previouly by nadler and krausche square water is explained for clearness and its connection with ferroeletric vertex models is discussed .",
    "simulations and results are presented in section iii and a summary presented in the final section .",
    "square water consists of a square lattice whose points are occupied by oxygens and whose lines are occupied by hydrogens .",
    "there are six different states per water particle , related to the possible distributions of two molecular hydrogens on four lattice lines ( fig .",
    "[ agua]a ) .",
    "the hydrogen bond is present when the hydrogen atom of one molecule ( donor ) points to the oxygen of a neighbour one ( acceptor ) , and is absent when both molecules intend to be donors or acceptors .",
    "typical situations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ agua]b . in the presence of a hydrogen bond ( hb ) an energy @xmath0",
    "is attributed to the lattice line , otherwise the energy is zero . because the bond between two neighbour molecules depends on the relative position of the hydrogen atoms , the model mimics the directional nature of hbs @xcite , despite the fact that it is a lattice model .",
    "hydrogen bonding is the only interaction considered , since van der waals interactions which should also be present are an order of magnitude smaller than hbs @xcite .",
    "the model for water is a generalization of square ice @xcite ( see fig [ agua]c ) , through the inclusion of thermal fluctuations which produce rotations of the molecules .",
    "it must not be confused with ice rule ferroelectric or vertex models @xcite for which energy of neighbour pairs is either zero or infinite ( no broken bonds ) and different energies are attributed to the particle states .",
    "the present model particles are allowed six states but the bond graph representation @xcite of the vertices is no longer adequate . as in generalized ferroeletric models",
    "the ice condition is broken , but in a completely different way : each oxygen atom is always surrounded by two hydrogens near it ( representing a neutral molecule ) but it is possible to have two , none or one hydrogen atom on each lattice line .",
    "an hb is present only in the last case .",
    "therefore , differently from vertex models , the energy depends on the neighbourhood .",
    "the hydrophobic properties of a square water solvent are tested on a model for aqueous solution of apolar molecules .",
    "single - site nonpolar particles are introduced on the lattice and , for simplicity , are considered inert ( interations with water or among themselves are disregarded ) . thus hbs are allowed to `` break '' due either to the presence of nonpolar particles or , as in the pure water model , as a result of thermal fluctuation .",
    "the properties of the two models were studied through monte carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "two types of movement are needed in order to go through the phase space of the system . for the pure system ,",
    "a new state is obtained using a local movement of the hb network : a water molecule is randomly chosen and a new state selected . in the mixture system , with the concentration of nonpolar particles fixed , an additional movement is introduced which consists of a random distance exchange @xcite between water and nonpolar particles ( a global movement ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the particles are randomly chosen and their spatial positions exchanged .",
    "the state of the water molecule in its new position is chosen randomly . in both cases the metropolis probability is used @xcite .",
    "random numbers are generated from ran2 @xcite .",
    "as shown previously by nadler and krausche @xcite from simulations , square water does not present a phase transition . in figure fig .",
    "[ calor_agua ] we present similar results for several lattice sizes , as well as exact calculations for small lattices : there are no significant differences in the specific heats of lattice sizes greater than l=10.@xcite per particle , and therefore the competition between a state with low energy and another one with high entropy is smoothed down . ) ]    the model solution was studied for concentration 20% .",
    "the system exhibits phase separation below a reduced transition temperature @xmath1 which is indicated by the peak in the specific heat shown in fig .",
    "[ calor_mix ] .",
    "lattice gas data at @xmath2 obtained from a random exchange algorithm @xcite are shown for comparison , as well as the exact result @xcite for the homogeneous phase .",
    "the square water and the  lattice gas mixtures may be compared respectively to associated@xcite and van der waals liquids acting as solvents .",
    "associated liquids present higher boiling temperature and lower solubility than corresponding van der waals liquids .",
    "the difference between these two model solvents is the directionality of the hb interaction .",
    "comparison of the specific heat peaks show that phase separation occurs for a larger reduced transition temperature in the case of the lattice gas . in order to understand this result",
    "we must look at the absolute transition temperature .",
    "van der waals bond energies @xmath3 are usually an order of magnitude lower than hb energies @xmath4 .",
    "thus    @xmath5    the absolute transition temperature of the aqueous solution model ( @xmath6 ) is  an order of magnitude greater than that of the van der waals solution ( @xmath7 ) , indicating lower solubility in the first case .    as to solubility properties of the model",
    ", it can be argued that it increases with temperature , following the tendency of the system to become homogeneous at higher temperatures@xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if this property persists at smaller overall concentrations .",
    "the study of water structure was performed in terms of frequency of bonds . at ambient temperatures",
    "the liquid water net presents around 88% of maximum number of bonds @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ tipos ] we present a histogram of particles classified according to the number of bonds ( there are between 0 and 4 hbs per particle ) for pure square water typical of this region ( 80 and 92% of hb , the latter corresponding to a temperature slightly below transition ) .    for the mixture we have classified separately first hydration shell ( first neighbours of apolar particles ) and bulk water particles .",
    "the water molecules around the nonpolar particles make less bonds and have a smaller frequency for maximum bond number .",
    "this result is in agreement with that obtained from simulations of atomic detail solvent @xcite . on the other hand , frequency of maximum bond number in the first hydration shell",
    "shows a smaller dependence on temperature as compared to bulk water , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tipos_mix ] .",
    "the hydration shell shows slower rate of decay of bonds with temperature above and specially below the phase separation transition .",
    "thus the ratio of frequencies of maximum bond number for shell vs bulk water increases with temperature .",
    "similar results have been seen in simulations of atomic detailed water@xcite , albeit in contradiction to the simplified off - lattice mb model@xcite .",
    "we have compared directional bonded ( square water ) and simple - bonded ( lattice gas ) solvents for apolar solutes in relation to phase - separation in terms of their specific heats . for 20%",
    "concentration square water presents lower reduced transition temperature but the associated hb net which it is intended to described presents a higher transition absolute temperature . at the concentration",
    "studied solubility increases with temperature contrary to what one would expect for apolar solutes in water .",
    "simulations at different concentrations must be undertaken in order to check whether this is an overall property of the model .",
    "hydrophobic properties of square water were also studied in terms of frequency of bonds of bulk and hydration shell water .",
    "hydration shell water `` looses '' structure with temperature at a slower rate than bulk water .",
    "this might contain some indication of the presence of `` hydrophobic '' hydration @xcite .",
    "the study of the effect of such properties on aggregation or structure of amphiphilic molecules may be of interest .",
