    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite allows the two legitimate parties , alice and bob , to share an information - theoretical secure key guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics . despite tremendous experimental efforts being made in the field  @xcite ,",
    "an important problem in current qkd implementations is the gap between its theory and practice  @xcite . to close this gap ,",
    "three main approaches have been developed .",
    "the first one is the security patch  @xcite , but it is difficult to include all potential and unnoticed security loopholes .",
    "the second one is the device - independent qkd ( di - qkd )  @xcite .",
    "this approach is still challenging with current technology , since it requires a loophole - free bell test .",
    "the third approach is the measurement - device - independent qkd ( mdi - qkd )  @xcite , which removes all detection - related security loopholes .",
    "such loophole is arguably the most important issue identified in conventional qkd implementations  @xcite . therefore , mdi - qkd is of great importance to promote the security of practical qkd systems .",
    "in addition , with current technology , mdi - qkd is suitable for both long distance communication and metropolitan networks  @xcite",
    ".    achievements of mdi - qkd have been made in both theory  @xcite and experiment @xcite .",
    "the experimental demonstration of mdi - qkd requires the indistinguishability of photons from alice and bob , mainly in three dimensions : spectrum , polarization , and timing . to solve this challenge ,",
    "the active stabilization systems were normally utilized in previous experiments .",
    "for example , the feedback temperature - control units for the distributed feedback lasers  @xcite or frequency - locked lasers @xcite were employed to match the spectral mode .",
    "the feedback temporal - control system was utilized to calibrate the arrival time of signals  @xcite . the phase ( or polarization ) stabilization system was always essential in the time - bin phase - encoding ( or polarization - encoding ) scheme .",
    "recently , many proposals and demonstrations have been made to mitigate the complexity in the implementations of mdi - qkd  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a promising scheme is the plug - and - play mdi - qkd  @xcite , which greatly reduces the experimental complexity of mode matching and reference - frame alignment .",
    "but , since the signal laser source and single photon detectors ( spds ) are in the charge of an untrusted server , plug - and - play mdi - qkd is vulnerable to source attacks  @xcite . fortunately , with the security analysis reported in  @xcite , plug - and - play mdi - qkd can be implemented even with a single untrusted source .",
    "however , so far , an experimental demonstration of plug - and - play mdi - qkd is still missing , except for a proof - of - concept test  @xcite with polarization encoding over free space channel within a few meters .",
    "this proof - of - concept test was operated in a wavelength outside the window of telecom - wavelength , and even so , it still needs some stabilization measures .    in this paper , we report a demonstration of plug - and - play mdi - qkd using time - bin phase - encoding over an asymmetric channel setting , in which the two channels from alice and bob to charlie are 14 km and 22 km standard optical fibers .",
    "the encoding optical pulses of alice and bob come from a single homemade laser held by charlie , which ensures that no mismatch exists in both pulse waveform and optical spectrum .",
    "thanks to the plug - and - play architecture  @xcite , the polarization state is automatically calibrated and stabilized .",
    "the encoding optical pulses of alice and bob share the same reference frame . in the asymmetric channel setting ,",
    "an experimental challenge is how to precisely match the timing of pulses , returned respectively from alice and bob over two mismatched channels .",
    "we developed a passive timing calibration method by using two synchronization lasers ( operating at 1310 nm ) and multiplexing them with the signal laser ( operating at 1550 nm ) via wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) .",
    "as we know , this is the first time that the passive timing calibration method is applied in the experiment of mdi - qkd .",
    "[ fig : setup ]",
    "the experimental setup of plug - and - play mdi - qkd is illustrated in figure  [ fig : setup](a ) .",
    "we implement the time - bin phase - encoding scheme  @xcite .",
    "the signal laser source ( 1550 nm ) and detectors are held by a common server ( charlie ) .",
    "the signal laser is internally modulated into a pulse train with a width of 2 ns ( fwhm ) at 1 mhz repetition rate .",
    "an asymmetric mach - zehnder interferometer ( amzi ) is utilized to separate the pulses into two time bins with 20 ns time delay .",
    "alice and bob only have the modulation devices including phase modulators ( pms ) and amplitude modulators ( ams ) for encoding . the key bit in @xmath0 basis is encoded into the relative phase , 0 or @xmath1 , by pm1 , while the key bit in @xmath2 basis is encoded into the time bin , 0 or 1 , by am1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup](b ) illustrates the structure of am1  @xcite .",
    "am1 contains a normal polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , a pbs with @xmath3 rotation from the optical axis , a phase modulator , and a faraday rotator , in which different optical intensities at the output port of pbs are realized by modulating the relative phase between the long path ( l ) and the short path ( s )  @xcite .",
    "pm2 is used for the active phase randomization , and am2 is used to implement the decoy states .",
    "the signal pulses travel through a single mode fiber spool of 14 km ( 22 km ) from charlie to alice ( bob ) . after being modulated by alice and bob",
    ", the pulses return to charlie interfere at the beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "a coincident detection at alternative time bins indicates a successful bell state measurement ( bsm ) . at the measurement site",
    ", the bsm is implemented with a polarization - maintaining bs and two commercial ingaas spds ( id201 ) with an efficiency of @xmath4 and a gate width of 2.5 ns .",
    "the dead time is @xmath5 @xmath6 with a dark count rate of @xmath7 per gate . a bell state ( singlet )",
    "is successfully post - selected when a coincidence of two spds happens at alternative time bins .",
    "after charlie announces the result of the partial bsm , alice and bob sift the raw key .",
    "the crucial aspect in the experiment is the indistinguishability of signal pulses from alice and bob , mainly in three dimensions : spectrum , polarization , and timing .",
    "errors would occur if any mismatch exists in these dimensions . in our system ,",
    "alice and bob share the same signal laser , which guarantees no mismatch in spectrum and in pulse waveform .",
    "the active phase randomization is implemented to eliminate the partial - phase - randomization attack . in our proof - of - principle demonstration ,",
    "a sawtooth wave with a repetition rate of 55 khz ( 15 khz ) is applied to the pm2 of alice ( bob )  @xcite , to globally randomize the phase of each optical pulse in the range of [ 0,2@xmath1 ] .",
    "alice s and bob s time bins come from the same amzi , so they share the same phase reference frame . for the polarization mode ,",
    "the plug - and - play architecture can automatically compensate for the birefringence effects  @xcite .",
    "in the asymmetric channel setting , the pulses of alice and bob travel different lengths of fibers .",
    "a challenge is to match the temporal mode .",
    "we use two additional synchronization lasers ( synl , 1310 nm ) to calibrate the arrival time .",
    "the whole system is synchronized in the following manner : the synl pulses are sent from charlie to alice ( bob ) , reflected back by a faraday mirror ( 1310 nm ) , and detected by a photoelectric detector ( pd ) .",
    "the output of pd is used to drive the signal laser ( 1550 nm ) to generate the signal pulses of bob ( alice ) . the temporal mode difference between alice and bob",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 represents the fiber length between charlie and bob .",
    "@xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the thermal expansion coefficient of fiber , and @xmath15 represents the change of temperature . the second term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is negligible since it only induces 0.14 ps with @xmath16 temperature change  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the arrival time difference of signals between alice and bob is a constant which can be compensated by adjusting the time delay between two synls with a delay chip .",
    "the temporal mode mismatch depends on the resolution of the delay chip ( 10ps ) which is much smaller than the width of the signal pulse ( 2ns ) .",
    "this ensures a high - visibility interference .",
    "in our demonstration , the optical pulses are modulated into three different intensities according to the decoy state method  @xcite , namely signal state intensity ( @xmath17 ) , decoy state intensity ( @xmath18 ) and vacuum state intensity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the optical intensities of a certain basis are put into 9 pairs .",
    "the experimental gains and quantum bit error rates ( qber ) for different intensity combinations are listed in table  [ tab : results1 ] and table  [ tab : results2 ] .",
    "the qbers of z - basis are due to the extinction ratio of am1 and the background counts ( rayleigh backscattering and detectors dark counts ) . in the ideal case",
    ", the qbers of z - basis should be 0 . while , in x - basis , the vacuum and multiphoton components of weak coherent states cause accidental coincidences which introduce an error rate of @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the error rate of x - basis has an expected value of @xmath21 .",
    "the secure key is extracted from the data when both alice and bob encode their bits using signal states ( @xmath22 ) in the z basis .",
    "the rest data is applied to estimate the parameters used in the secure key rate calculation . in the asymptotic case ,",
    "the secure key rate is given by  @xcite @xmath23-q_{\\mu\\mu}^{z}fh(e_{\\mu\\mu}^{z})\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the possibility , overall gain , and qber when alice and bob send the signal states in the z basis .",
    "@xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a lower bound of the yield of single photon states in the @xmath2 basis ; @xmath29 is an upper bound of the qber of the single photon states in the @xmath0 basis ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be estimated from the decoy state method ; @xmath30 is the error correction efficiency ; @xmath31 is the binary shannon entropy function .",
    "a total number of @xmath32 pulses are sent out in the experiment .",
    "we take the value @xmath33 and @xmath34 in our calculation . by using the analytical bounds derived in  @xcite",
    ", we obtain that @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see appendix  [ app ] ) .",
    "finally , a secure key rate of @xmath37 bits per pulse is demonstrated .                                                                                  in the experiment , we only have two traditional amplitude modulators without the bias control circuits .",
    "thus , we use the settings of fig .",
    "1(b ) to serve as amplitude modulators .",
    "this kind of amplitude modulator features an outstanding stability which has been demonstrated in  @xcite . to be honest , this method would bring in an additional optical pulse at the input port of pbs , which would cause the leakage of bit information .",
    "but it does nt matter since we can eliminate this problem simply by replacing it with a traditional am .    in our demonstration , for simplicity",
    ", we take advantage of the simplest active phase randomization method .",
    "the phase is not uniformly distributed in the range of [ 0,2@xmath1 ] .",
    "but , it does nt affect the feasibility of our demonstration , since the effective phase - randomization technique has been demonstrated in several experiments .",
    "drift in the fiber length is affected by the temperature change and the mechanical vibration . in the experiment",
    ", the mechanical vibration plays less important role than the temperature change .",
    "therefore , we only take the effect of temperature change into consideration ."
