    "in 1964 , faced with a large proliferation of strongly interacting subatomic particles , murray gell - mann  @xcite and , independently , george zweig  @xcite hypothesized the existence of three fractionally charged constituent fermions called `` quarks , '' the charge@xmath3 up - quark ( @xmath4 ) and the charge@xmath5 down- ( @xmath6 ) and strange- ( @xmath7 ) quarks and their antiparticles ( @xmath8 coulombs ) . in the gell - mann zweig scheme ,",
    "mesons are formed from quark and antiquark ( @xmath9 ) pairs ] and baryons from three - quark triplets ( @xmath10 ) . ]",
    "this picture was remarkably successful ; it accounted for all of the known hadrons at that time and predicted the existence of additional hadrons that were subsequently discovered .",
    "now , over forty years later , the gell - mann zweig idea , currently known as the `` constituent quark model '' ( cqm ) , remains an effective scheme for classifying all of the known hadrons , although the number of quarks has expanded to include the charge@xmath3 charmed- ( @xmath11 ) and top- ( @xmath12 ) quarks and the charge@xmath13 bottom- ( @xmath14 ) quark .",
    "our current understanding is that the forces that bind quarks into hadrons are described by the non - abelian field theory called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . at distance",
    "scales that correspond to the separations between quarks inside hadrons , qcd is a strongly coupled theory and perturbation theory is of limited applicability . it is expected that ultimately , numerical lattice qcd computations @xcite will generate predictions for qcd observables such as masses , transitions , decays , etc .",
    "however , progress , while steady , is slow , and it will be some time before the predictions are able to make precise reliable predictions for excited charmonium states . to date",
    ", models that incorporate general features of the qcd theory have proven to be most useful for describing the spectra and properties of hadrons .",
    "a prediction of these qcd - motivated models , supported by lattice qcd , is the existence of hadrons with more complex substructures than the simple @xmath9 mesons and the @xmath10 baryons .",
    "however , in spite of considerable experimental effort , no unambiguous evidence for hadrons with a non - cqm - like structure has been found , at least not until recently , when studies of the spectrum of charmonium mesons , _ i.e. _ mesons formed from a @xmath0 pair , have uncovered a number of meson candidates that do not seem to conform to cqm expectations .",
    "the status of these candidate non-@xmath9 particles , the so - called @xmath15 mesons , is the subject of this review , which is organized as follows : section 2 provides a brief summary of theoretical expectations for charmonium mesons and the more complex structures that are expected in the context of qcd ; section 3 provides some experimental background of the recent observations ; section 4 forms the bulk of the review , describing the evidence for and measured properties of the @xmath15 states , why they defy any cqm assignment , and theoretical speculation about their nature and how to test these hypotheses .",
    "summary points and future issues are given in section 5 .",
    "recent related reviews on charmonium spectroscopy and the @xmath15 states are given in refs .",
    "qcd - motivated potential models successfully described the @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath0 states soon after they were discovered more than thirty years ago .",
    "these models have stood up quite well over the ensuing years , during which time other low - lying @xmath0 states were discovered and found to have properties that agree reasonably well with the models predictions .",
    "early pioneering papers also predicted the existence of mesons that are more complicated than conventional @xmath9 states such as multiquark states  @xcite mesons and @xmath10 baryons ] and hybrid mesons , states with an excited gluonic degree of freedom @xcite . while corresponding _",
    "exotic _ states are predicted to exist in the light meson spectrum , there they are difficult to disentangle from the dense background of conventional states  @xcite .",
    "the charmonium spectrum provides a cleaner environment where one might hope that non - conventional states containing @xmath0 pairs would be easier to identify . in this section",
    "we give a brief overview of the properties of conventional charmonium states and the non - conventional multiquark and hybrid states .",
    "in addition , we mention threshold effects that could masquerade as resonances .      in qcd - motivated quark potential models , quarkonium states are described as a quark - antiquark pair bound by an inter - quark force with a short - distance behavior dominated by single - gluon - exchange and , thus , approximately coulombic , plus a linearly increasing confining potential that dominates at large separations .",
    "typically , the energy levels are found by solving a non - relativistic schrdinger equation , although there are more sophisticated calculations that take into account relativistic corrections and other effects .",
    "these give energy levels that are characterized by the radial quantum number @xmath18 and the relative orbital angular momentum between the quark and antiquark , @xmath19 .",
    "the current status of this approach is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccbar - spectrum ] , where the charmonium levels are shown . for those levels that have been assigned ,",
    "the commonly used name of its associated meson is indicated .",
    "3.0 truein    the orbital levels are labeled by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ,  corresponding to @xmath23 , 1 , 2  .",
    "the quark and antiquark spins couple to give the total spin @xmath24 ( spin - singlet ) or @xmath25 ( spin - triplet ) . @xmath20 and @xmath19 couple to give the total angular momentum of the state , @xmath26 .",
    "the parity of a quark - antiquark state with orbital angular momentum @xmath19 is @xmath27 and the charge conjugation eigenvalue is given by @xmath28 .",
    "quarkonium states are generally denoted by @xmath29 with quantum numbers @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the @xmath23 states are @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ; the @xmath35 states are @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ; the @xmath42 states are @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath34 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , etc .",
    "in addition to the spin - independent potential , there are spin - dependent interactions that produce corrections of order @xmath48 .",
    "these are found by assuming a specific lorentz structure for the quark - antiquark interactions .",
    "typically the short distance one - gluon - exchange is taken to be a lorentz vector interaction and the confinement piece is assumed to be a lorentz scalar .",
    "this gives rise to splittings within multiplets .",
    "for example , the @xmath49 splitting is attributed to a short distance @xmath50 contact interaction arising from the one - gluon - exchange , while the splittings of the @xmath21-wave @xmath51 and higher @xmath19 states are due to spin - orbit and tensor spin - spin interactions arising from one - gluon - exchange and a relativistic spin - orbit thomas precession term .",
    "the recent measurement of the @xmath52 mass by cleo  @xcite is an important validation of this picture .",
    "an important approach to understanding the charmonium spectrum is lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable recent progress in calculating the masses of excited @xmath0 states and radiative transitions @xcite , although the results are still not at the point that they can make precision predictions for excited states . however , lattice qcd calculations of the static energy between a heavy quark - antiquark pair are in good agreement with phenomenological potentials @xcite and lattice calculations of the spin - dependent potentials also support the phenomenological contact , tensor , and spin - orbit potentials @xcite",
    ".    all charmonium states below the @xmath53 `` open - charm '' mass threshold and @xmath54 mesons are the spin - singlet @xmath20-wave ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 quark state , respectively .",
    "] have been observed .",
    "the @xmath22-wave @xmath0 states lie just above this threshold and , thus far , only the @xmath58 state , which is identified as the @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) , has been observed .",
    "the remaining @xmath61 @xmath22-wave charmonium states , the spin triplet @xmath62 and @xmath63 states and the spin singlet @xmath64 state , are all expected to have masses near 3800  mev/@xmath65 and to be narrow @xcite so that it should be possible to observe them @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 @xmath21 states are the next highest multiplet , with masses predicted to lie in the range of @xmath67  mev/@xmath65 and with total widths of 42 , 165 , 30 , and 87  mev/@xmath65 for the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we also mention the @xmath72 since it is relatively narrow for a state so massive , with a predicted mass and width of 4021 and @xmath73  mev respectively .",
    "the @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) mass and width are predicted to be @xmath76  mev/@xmath65 and @xmath77  mev/@xmath65 .",
    "while the mass value is an important first element for the identification of a new state , more information is usually needed to distinguish between different possibilities .",
    "one therefore needs other measurements to form a detailed picture of its internal structure .",
    "decay properties are an important aspect of this .",
    "electromagnetic transitions can potentially give information on the quantum numbers of a parent state when it decays to a final state with established quantum numbers such as the @xmath16 or @xmath78 ; studies of the angular correlations among the final state decay particles provide additional information .",
    "quark model predictions also provide an important benchmark against which to test a conventional quarkonium interpretation versus an exotic one .",
    "the theory of electromagnetic transitions between quarkonium states is straightforward , and potential models provide detailed predictions that can be compared to experimental measurements to test the internal structure of a state .",
    "the leading - order amplitudes are those for electric ( @xmath79 ) and magnetic ( @xmath80 ) dipole transitions , with the @xmath79 amplitude being the most relevant to our discussion .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath81 transitions are in good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "we can therefore expect that other electromagnetic transitions will also yield useful information , with the possible exceptions for those cases where there are large dynamical cancellations in the matrix elements , for instance those that involve higher radial excitations that have nodes in their wavefunctions .",
    "the status of electromagnetic transitions has been reviewed recently @xcite and detailed predictions for charmonium states are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "charmonium states can also undergo hadronic transitions from one @xmath0 state to another via the emission of light hadrons .",
    "examples of observed transitions include @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the theoretical description of hadronic transitions uses a multipole expansion of the gluonic fields @xcite which resembles the usual multipole expansion applied to electromagnetic transitions .",
    "detailed predictions for hadronic transitions are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "charmonium states above the @xmath53 and/or @xmath86 mass threshold can decay to @xmath87 final states .",

    "these decays are well described by the @xmath89 model in which a light @xmath9 pair is created out of the vacuum with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the partial decay widths have been calculated for many mesons using this model and the overall qualitative agreement with experiment is very good .",
    "thus , the predictions can provide a useful means of identifying conventional charmonium states .",
    "recent calculations of decay properties of excited charmonium states are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a final decay mechanism of charmonium states is via the annihilation of the @xmath0 into final states consisting of gluons and light quark pairs , sometimes with a photon @xcite .",
    "however , so far at least , these have not proven to be very important for understanding the new states .",
    "an early quark model prediction was the existence of multiquark states , specifically bound meson - antimeson molecular states  @xcite . in the light quark sector the @xmath90 and @xmath91 are considered to be strong candidates for @xmath92 molecules .",
    "however , in general , it is challenging to definitively identify a light multiquark state in an environment of many broad and often overlapping conventional states .",
    "the charmonium spectrum is better defined so that new types of states can potentially be more easily delineated from conventional charmonium states .",
    "the observation of the @xmath93 , the first of the @xmath15 particles to be seen , brought forward the hope that one can definitively state that a multiquark state has been observed .",
    "two generic types of multiquark states have been described in the literature .",
    "the first , a molecular state , sometimes referred to as a deuson @xcite , is comprised of two charmed mesons bound together to form a molecule .",
    "these states are by nature loosely bound .",
    "molecular states bind through two mechanisms : quark / colour exchange interactions at short distances and pion exchange at large distance @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cartoon_fig ] ) although pion exchange is expected to dominate @xcite .",
    "molecular states are generally not isospin eigenstates , which gives rise to distinctive decay patterns . because the mesons inside the molecule are weakly bound , they tend to decay as if they are free .",
    "details are reviewed by swanson in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second type is a tightly bound four - quark state , dubbed a tetraquark , that is predicted to have properties that are distinct from those of a molecular state . in the model of maiani _ et al _ @xcite , the tetraquark is described as a diquark - diantiquark structure in which the quarks group into colour - triplet scalar and vector clusters and the interactions are dominated by a simple spin - spin interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon_fig ] ) . here",
    ", strong decays are expected to proceed via rearrangement processes followed by dissociation that give rise , for example , to decays such as @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "a prediction that distinguishes multiquark states containing a @xmath0 pair from conventional charmonia is the possible existence of multiplets that include members with non - zero charge ( e.g. @xmath96 $ ] ) , strangeness ( e.g. @xmath97 $ ] ) , or both ( e.g. @xmath98 $ ] )  @xcite .    3.0 truein      hybrid mesons are states with an excited gluonic degree of freedom ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cartoon_fig ] ) .",
    "these are described by many different models and calculational schemes  @xcite . a compelling description , supported by lattice qcd  @xcite , views the quarks as moving in adiabatic potentials produced by gluons in analogy to the atomic nuclei in molecules moving in the adiabatic potentials produced by electrons .",
    "the lowest adiabatic surface leads to the conventional quarkonium spectrum while the excited adiabatic surfaces are found by putting the quarks into more complicated colour configurations . in the flux - tube model  @xcite , the lowest excited adiabatic surface corresponds to transverse excitations of the flux tube and leads to a doubly degenerate octet of the lowest mass hybrids with quantum numbers @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath40 and @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath105 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 quantum numbers are not possible for a @xmath0 bound state in the quark model and are referred to as _ exotic",
    "_ quantum numbers . if observed , they would unambiguously signal the existence of an unconventional state .",
    "lattice qcd and most models predict the lowest charmonium hybrid state to be roughly 4200  mev / c@xmath106 in mass @xcite .",

    "the partial widths have been calculated using many different models .",
    "there are some general properties that seem to be supported by most models and by recent lattice qcd calculations .",
    "nevertheless , since there are no experimental results against which to test these calculations , one should take their predictions with a grain of salt .",
    "two important decay modes are :    1",
    ".   @xmath116 .",
    "most calculations predict that the @xmath117 should decay to a @xmath21-wave plus an @xmath20-wave meson . in this case",
    "@xmath118 final states should dominate over decays to @xmath53 and the partial width to @xmath119 should be very small .",
    "2 .   @xmath120 these modes offer clean experimental signatures .",
    "if the total width is small , they could have significant branching fractions .",
    "one recent lattice qcd calculation finds that these types of decays are potentially quite large , @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "in addition to various types of resonances , thresholds can also give rise to structures in cross sections and kinematic distributions .",
    "possible thresholds include the @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 at @xmath126 38721 , 4020 , 4287 , and 4430  mev respectively . at threshold ,",
    "the cross section is typically dominated by @xmath20-wave ( l=0 ) scattering although in some cases higher waves can be important . states in a relative @xmath20-wave with little relative momentum and who live long on the time scale of strong interactions will have enough time to exchange pions and interact @xcite .",
    "binding is then possible via an attractive @xmath127 exchange which could occur via couplings such as @xmath128 and can lead to the molecular states discussed above .",
    "however , other strong interaction effects might also lead to a repulsive interaction that could result in a virtual state above threshold .",
    "thus , passing through a kinematical threshold can lead to structure in the cross section that may or may not indicate a resonance .",
    "in addition , if there are nearby @xmath0 states , they will interact with the threshold resulting in mass shifts of both the @xmath0 resonance and the threshold - related enhancement .",
    "the effects of this channel coupling can be quite significant in the observed cross section , particularly close to thresholds @xcite .",
    "this was studied for @xmath2 annihilation some time ago @xcite .",
    "given the observation of new charmonium - like states in channels other than @xmath129 , it would be useful to revisit these studies .",
    "the observations described below were made possible by the extraordinary performance of the pepii @xmath1-factory at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) in the u.s . , and the kekb @xmath1-factory at the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) in japan .",
    "these @xmath1-factories , which were constructed to test the standard model mechanism for matter - antimatter asymmetries  so - called @xmath130 violation , are very high luminosity electron ( @xmath131 ) positron ( @xmath132 ) colliders operating at a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy near 10,580  mev .",
    "electron - positron annihilations at this cm energy produce large numbers of @xmath1-meson anti@xmath1-meson ( @xmath133 ) pairs in a coherent quantum state .",
