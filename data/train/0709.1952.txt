    "realization of inflation is typically associated with a slow rolling scalar field minimally coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "is it possible to have inflation with a non - minimally coupled scalar field , in particular with a conformally coupled field ?",
    "this question is especially interesting in the context of superstring theory , where many scalars are conformally coupled to gravity ; or in supergravity theory , where scalars typically have the mass of order of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "indeed , among a number of inflationary scenarios , simple scenarios which come in the package with high energy physics draw an especial attention .",
    "recently there is significant interest to package up inflation with the string theory .",
    "there are different models of string theory inflation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "often string inflation models require significant fine - tuning .",
    "the most typical problem however is the @xmath8-problem , manifested in heavy inflaton mass preventing slow roll of inflaton . for realization of slow - roll inflation",
    "the effective inflaton mass should be much smaller than the hubble parameter during inflation , @xmath9 .",
    "an example of this problem is warped brane inflation ( based on the configurations of interacting branes in warped geometry ) where the inflaton is conformally coupled to the four - dimensional gravity  @xcite  . by considering inflaton - dependence of the superpotential , it is possible to alter @xmath10 from @xmath11 as pointed out in the kklmmt and subsequent papers .",
    "however , we would like to stress here that curvature coupling before including this extra ingredient is conformal and we shall consider this value throughout this paper . ] . a scalar field",
    "@xmath12 conformally coupled to gravity acquires effective mass term @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "this gives the inflaton the effective mass @xmath15 which does not result in the slow - roll .",
    "this problem has been considered as a stumbling block on the way to build up successful warped brane - antibrane inflation .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that in fact conformal coupling is not a problem for realization of inflation .",
    "inflationary regime in this case can be realized .",
    "however , it has new features which make it very different from other models .",
    "first , inflation with a conformally coupled inflaton with a potential @xmath16 , which is almost flat over the range of @xmath12 , can be realized as the rapid - roll inflation , contrary to the customary slow roll inflation .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first model of inflation with a conformally coupled inflaton .",
    "our model can be regarded also as a new model of the fast rolling inflaton . a model of fast roll inflaton based on a minimally coupled scalar field",
    "was suggested in @xcite .    with conformal coupling , the only feature of the warped brane - antibrane inflation needed for conformal inflation is the form of its potential : very shallow for the most part of the inflaton rolling and changing sharply at the end point of inflation .",
    "therefore , application of the conformal rapid - roll inflation is broader than the warped brane - antibrane inflation .",
    "it includes , for instance , field - theoretic hybrid models ( with conformal inflaton ) where the potential is almost flat during inflation .",
    "second , the string - theory realization of rapid - roll conformal inflation is a low energy inflation ( close to the least possible energy of inflation at @xmath17 tev scale ) . as a result",
    "it requires significantly less efoldings @xmath18 than the figure @xmath19 typical for the gut scale chaotic inflation . in the context of the warped geometry , as we will show , @xmath18 and the scale of inflation are directly related to the warp factor of the throat geometry of the internal manifold .",
    "noticeably , lower bound for efolds of inflation @xmath18 coincides with the warping needed for the randall - sundrum solution of the hierarchy problem .    from the viewpoint of observational cosmology , the possibility to motivate inflation which lasts just to provide homogeneity / isotropy only within the observable horizon ( but not beyond it ) is interesting with respect to the low multi - poles anomalies found in the cobe and wmap cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "there are attempts to build up the models with the spectra of primordial fluctuations truncated at the horizon scales ( for instance see @xcite ) , but not much motivation for the choice of the scale of truncation was found .",
    "the model of conformal inflation naturally gives truncation of fluctuations at the horizon scales .",
    "the third feature of our model is different origin of its cosmological fluctuations .",
    "a conformally coupled inflaton can not be responsible for generation of primordial fluctuations .",
    "as we shall show , fluctuations also can not be generated from the angular degrees of freedom , associated with the angular positions of branes in the bulk klebanov - strassler throat geometry .",
    "we propose modulated ( inhomogeneous reheating ) fluctuations  @xcite or curvaton fluctuations  @xcite of the scalars of the sm sector or other moduli fields .    in the rest of the paper we will address these features of the model .",
    "conventional inflationary models are based on minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "indeed , slow roll inflation requires relatively small effective inflaton mass @xmath9 , while conformal coupling violates this condition .",
    "let us nonetheless consider a conformally coupled scalar field with a very simple flat potential .",
    "this is relevant for a couple of interesting inflationary models . in the warped brane inflation",
    "the inflaton candidate is an open string modulus , brane - antibrane distance .",
    "denote this scalar field in the four - dimensional effective theory as @xmath12 .",
    "brane - antibrane interaction results in the four - dimensional scalar field potential  @xcite @xmath20 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the reduced planck mass , @xmath23 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath24 is related to the warp factor @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the @xmath0-brane tension . except for small values of @xmath12",
    ", this potential is very flat .",
    "another example of almost flat potential is the usual field - theoretic hybrid inflation .    as the first step , consider dynamics of the frw universe dominated by a conformally - coupled scalar field with a potential which can be approximated by a constant . although the potential is flat , scalar field dynamics is significant due to the conformal coupling to the curvature , which can be interpreted as induced mass of the scalar field .",
    "non - trivial observation is that de sitter spacetime is self - consisted solution of this system .",

    "( [ sol ] ) we immediately obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the scale factor ( [ scale ] ) corresponds to the de sitter solution .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath14 . in sec .",

    "as we have shown above , a conformally coupled scalar field can lead to inflation . during inflation",
    ", however , the inflaton evolves as @xmath55 with the velocity @xmath56 this is rapid roll inflation .",
    "the number of efolds @xmath57 for this rapid roll inflation is reduced to @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the values of the inflaton at the beginning and end of inflation . as we will show in the next section , low energy inflation",
    "can be realized for the warped geometry brane inflation .    in the previous section",

    "we derive the conditions for a general potential @xmath16 to realize conformal inflation .    for a minimally coupled inflaton",
    ", conditions for the potential @xmath16 to provide inflation can be formulated in terms of smallness of the slow - roll parameters @xmath61    we will discuss their generalization for the rapid roll inflaton . for an arbitrary potential @xmath16 , the equation of motion and the friedman equation for the conformal inflaton can be re - written as @xmath62 where @xmath63    inflation corresponds to the slow variation of the hubble parameter @xmath64 .",

    "a we derive the conditions for the conformal inflation : @xmath69 under these conditions the equations motion are approximated as @xmath70 and the hubble expansion rate @xmath64 is slowly varying with time , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "in the kklmmt setup for the warped brane inflation  @xcite , an inflaton emerges as a conformal field .",
    "it has been believed that the conformal coupling should spoil the flatness of the inflaton potential and that additional severe fine - tuning should be necessary . in this section",
    "we shall show that , contrary to the folklore , inflation in this model can be realized without further fine - tuning .",
    "the inflaton in the warped setup is a conformally coupled scalar field with the potential ( [ potential ] ) . for this potential ,",
    "the condition ( [ eqn : tilde - eta_c ] ) with @xmath72 is reduced just to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the conditions for inflation ( [ eqn : epsilon ] ) , ( [ eqn : tilde - epsilon ] ) and ( [ eqn : tilde - eta_c ] ) can be written as @xmath74 .",

    "( [ eqn : eom - pi ] ) with the potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "we can study scalar field / gravity dynamics in great details using the powerful phase portrait method , which shows the character of _ all _ solutions for @xmath75 and @xmath76 as trajectories in the two - dimensional phase space .",
    "for the minimally coupled scalar field , convenient coordinates for the phase portrait are @xmath77 .",
    "phase portraits for monomic potentials contain separatrices which attract most of the trajectories  @xcite .",
    "these separatrices correspond to the inflationary regime of slow rolling .    in the case of a conformal scalar field , the qualitative behavior of the scalar field",
    "/ gravity system can be also studied by drawing the phase portrait . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 and the dimensionless time coordinate @xmath80 as @xmath81 we will deal with the two - dimensional phase portrait in terms of @xmath82 , or with its dimensionless copy in terms of @xmath83 .    the equations of motion ( [ eqn : eom - pi ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath83 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",

    "one can easily see that most of the solutions quickly approaches this inflationary separatrices .",
    "at first glance there is no common ground for the mass hierarchy and duration of inflation .",
    "we give a surprising example where both of those emerge from the same underlying physics .",
    "consider warped brane inflation .",
    "suppose inflation begins at the initial field value @xmath59 , and ends at the end point of inflation @xmath60 . according to eq .",
    "( [ efolds ] ) , number of efolds of the rapid roll inflation is @xmath90 . in the context of the warped geometry the modulus field @xmath12",
    "is related to the radial coordinate of the throat @xmath91 as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a radius of the ads which well approximates the ks throat geometry .",
    "thus the number of efolds is @xmath94 and is bounded from above as @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 are values of the radial coordinate at the top and the tip of the throat , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath25 is the warp factor at the tip of the throat geometry .",
    "the value of the warp factor @xmath25 depends on the energy scale associated with the throat .",
    "for example , the warp factor @xmath99 is related to the standard model , tev scale throat .",
    "( see ( [ hierarchy ] ) below with @xmath100 . ) thus , in single - throat scenarios where the brane - antibrane pair is also in the tev scale throat , the inequality ( [ eqn : nlsima ] ) says that the number of efolding @xmath18 is less than @xmath101 .",
    "we shall see below that even in multi - throat scenarios where the scale of inflation and the electroweak scale are not necessarily related  , the number of efoldings @xmath102 corresponding to the wavelength of the present observable horizon is bounded from above . actually , we shall obtain the bound @xmath103 applicable to both single- and multi - throat scenarios .",

    "let us recall the warping ( randall - sundrum ) solution of the hierarchy problem @xcite between the planck scale @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and low energy scale @xmath113 , based on the warped ads geometry @xmath116 suppose that the scale of inflation @xmath104 is determined in this way .",

    "at this point the model we are investigating is far from being complete .",
    "we have not elaborated the picture of cosmological fluctuations in the models of conformal inflation . in this section",
    "we just discuss some ideas about generation of cosmological fluctuations in the model .",
    "conformally coupling inflaton can not be responsible for generation of primordial fluctuations .",
    "indeed , conformal inflaton with the constant potential is described by the equation @xmath143 , which can be mapped by conformal transformation @xmath144 to the wave equation in the flat space - time .",
    "thus , conformal inflaton fluctuations can not be generated during inflation .",
    "cosmological fluctuations , however , can be generated as the modulated ( e.g. inhomogeneous reheating ) fluctuations  @xcite or curvaton fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "obvious candidate for these are fluctuations of the angular degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , setting of the warped brane - antibrane inflation includes @xmath0 brane and anti @xmath0 brane in six dimensional klebanov - strassler throat geometry  @xcite . while radial distance of @xmath0-@xmath1 pair acts as an inflaton , its five bulk angular coordinates are other moduli fields .",
    "it turns out that angular fluctuations are effectively conformal scalar fields and can not be responsible for the modulated fluctuations .",
    "this is demonstrated in the appendix b. if inflaton is not conformal , angular fluctuations are also non - conformal and generated during inflation . similarly , modulated fluctuations in principle can be provided by the scalars of sm sector ( the higgs fields ) or from the moduli field coupled with the sm sector . for this",
    "we need a light scalar field with the effective mass smaller than the hubble parameter .",
    "if we deal with the fields with the mass term @xmath145 which is not changing during the inflation and reheating , we encounter here new difficulties .",
    "indeed , the hubble parameter in this low - energy inflation is very small , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "potential candidates for very light scalars would be the khler moduli or axions associated with the four - cycles of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "khler moduli @xmath80 may have very flat potential at large values of @xmath80 , while axion is very light .",
    "another potential candidate of the light scalar is the scalar mode that is the super partner of the goldstone mode associated with @xmath148 symmetry breaking in ks geometry  @xcite .",
    "it is massless in the limit of infinite throat but shall acquire mass when the throat is compactified .",
    "other possibilities is to have the scalar field potential such that moduli or curvaton scalar is very light scalars during inflation but became massive at lower energies after inflation .",
    "the amplitude of modulated or curvaton fluctuations is proportional to @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the mean value amplitude of the moduli / curvaton during inflation .",

    "contrary to the folklore that conformal coupling should spoil inflationary behavior , we have shown that a conformally coupled scalar field can actually drive inflation .",
    "this surprising result potentially has significant impacts on development of the phenomenological inflationary models as well as inflationary models in string theory since an inflaton for warped brane inflation typically has conformal coupling .",
    "indeed , the inflaton potential ( without further fine - tuning ) for warped brane inflation ( [ potential ] ) satisfies all the conditions for conformal inflation ( [ eqn : epsilon ] ) , ( [ eqn : tilde - epsilon ] ) and ( [ eqn : tilde - eta_c ] ) in the regime ( [ eqn : inflationary - regime ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : portrait ] , we have confirmed the onset of inflationary behavior ( for a wide range of initial conditions ) by using the phase portrait method .    we have shown the following three features of the conformal inflation :    * the conformal inflation is a rapid roll inflation .",

    "it has similar bound in the context of the hybrid inflation ( unless @xmath12 is not bounded by @xmath158 from above ) . * cosmological fluctuations originated from modulated or curvaton fluctuations .",
    "since the conformal inflation arises rather naturally in the context of warped brane inflation in string theory , it is certainly worthwhile investigating more details of its properties .",
    "another interesting question is about how realization of inflation depends on the value of the curvature coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the best way to study this issue apparently would be to construct the phase portrait of the dynamical system ( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) , and to seek for the inflationary separatrices .",
