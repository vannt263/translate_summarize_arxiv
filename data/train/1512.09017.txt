    "power variability is one of the main obstacles facing renewable energy expansion .",
    "solar and wind are of main concern since their electrical production is proportional to the variability associated with wind and solar resources@xcite .",
    "this poses an issue for current electrical infrastructure which was designed around variability in demand , not generation .",
    "transient local demand changes over seconds or minutes are for the most part small and spatially uncorrelated resulting a relatively steady demand profile . over several hours",
    ", loads can change substantially , but these changes in load have a tendency to be more predictable .",
    "this is manifested through daily patterns of morning load pickup and evening load drop - off highly correlated with human activity@xcite .",
    "wind and solar generation , on the other hand , is variable .",
    "an individual wind turbine or solar plant can ramp from full to less than half of production in a minute .",
    "on the other hand the aggregate variability of multiple turbines at the same site or even all renewable generators in a balancing area is relatively much less @xcite .",
    "still such variability is not entirely predictable and therefore causes uncertainty in projecting power output minutes to days ahead .",
    "variability and uncertainty are more critical in standalone or island mode applications where a high penetration of renewable power sources ramping near synchronously may create power variability that is large enough to cause substantial power quality and/or grid economics issues .",
    "an approach to solve this problem is to increase scheduling and adjustments to controllable loads to `` load follow '' wind and solar generation on the grid @xcite .",
    "examples of controllable loads are devices such as air conditioners and refrigerators with a temperature dead band that effectively creates a thermal storage reservoir .",
    "the load power of these type of machines can be changed temporarily while respecting the demands of the end user @xcite .",
    "another example is scheduling of more intermittent loads such as water pumps , which can be adjusted to accommodate power variability , claim optimal power usage , and decrease power losses . the control and scheduling of such loads benefits from supply and load forecast @xcite .",
    "+ load scheduling has been applied in many fields , such as thermal loads , residential appliances , and ev charging @xcite . in @xcite , a case study",
    "was implemented to accomodate wind power variability through ev charging .",
    "another example for household appliances scheduling was demonstrated in @xcite . from the supply side",
    ", @xcite discussed new dispatch methodology to power and control a hybrid wind turbine and battery system . in @xcite ,",
    "more work was done toward game theory and customers effect on the grid .",
    "+ model predictive control ( mpc ) was used in most approaches@xcite to compute optimal control or scheduling signals for the load .",
    "typically , in mpc a constraint ( quadratic ) optimization problem is solved iteratively over a finite @xmath0 and moving time @xmath1 horizon from @xmath2 till @xmath3 to compute an optimal control signal in real time , denoted here by @xmath4 at time @xmath2 .",
    "countless examples of innovative mpc based approaches for load scheduling , grid tied storage systems or to maintain voltage stability can be found in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "although mpc approaches are extremely powerful in computing optimal control signals over a moving but finite time horizon , typically the control signal @xmath4 is allowed to attain any real value during the optimization , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a real - valued control signal @xmath4 would require distinctive loads on an electric grid to operate at fractional load demands .",
    "although this can be implemented by electric storage systems or partial or pulse width modulation of loads @xcite , ( non - linear ) dynamic power profiles of the electric loads in terms of dynamic power ramp up / down and minimum time on / off of each load is harder to implement in a standard mpc framework .",
    "+ in this paper we define load scheduling as the optimal on / off combinations and timing of a set of distinct electric loads via the computation of an optimal binary control signal @xmath5 . the work is partially motivated by previous work @xcite and @xcite in which the design and sizing problem of a standalone photovoltaic reverse osmosis ( ro ) system is considered , where the ro loads are to be scheduled on / off .",
    "the work in @xcite computes the optimal size and number of units for a selected location but lacks the procedure for optimally scheduling dynamic loads .",
    "here we aim to find optimal load scheduling by on / off switching of possibly non - linear dynamics electric loads .",
    "+ the mpc optimization problem becomes untractable for binary load switching because of the exponentiation growth of the binary combinations in the length of the prediction horizon @xmath0 and the number @xmath6 of loads .",
    "constraints on the allowable load switching help to alleviate the combinatorial problem , making mpc optimization with binary switching computationally feasible .",
    "the approach presented in this paper will be illustrated in a simulation study in which each load has its own dynamics for both turning on and shutting off .",
    "solar forecasting data on a partly cloudy morning and a clear afternoon at uc san diego is used to illustrate how loads are scheduled to turn on / off dynamically to track solar power predictions .",
    "the moving horizon nature of forecasts serve as an ideal input to the mpc algorithm . with the finite prediction horizon in mpc",
    "it is crucial to have reliable forecast of power delivery .",
    "however , in reality cloud advection forecasts become less accurate over longer horizons as the cloud dynamics render the basic assumptions of static clouds invalid .",
    "this inaccuracy leads to error in the mpc decision . either an overprediction can cause loads to activate during a period where there is not enough solar energy to meet the demand or an underprediction can prevent loads from being schedule even though energy would have been available .",
    "for this reason , we will investigate mis - scheduling due to forecast errors .",
    "+ section  [ sec : sdlm ] introduces the dynamic loads assumptions in terms of dynamic power ramping and on / off time constraints .",

    "the admissible on / off transition signal @xmath26 of a load at time @xmath21 can now be formalized by the switching signal @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the most recent ( last ) time stamp at which the load @xmath9 was switched `` off '' , and the opposite goes to @xmath29 @xcite .      for the computational results presented in this paper ,",
    "linear first order continuous - time dynamic models will be used to model the dynamics of the power demand of the loads .",

    "the binary switching signal @xmath10 transitions from 0 to 1 ( `` on '' ) or transitions from 1 to 0 ( `` off '' ) , different time constants are used in the first order models .",

    "to achieve the optimal switching times @xmath35 of the binary switching signals @xmath17 for each load discretizing the power demand @xmath7 and the optimal switching signal @xmath17 was performed at a time sampling @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sampling time and @xmath38 is an integer index . to simplify the integer math",

    "@xmath49 it is clear that computing optimal @xmath39 will involve a criterion function and possible constraints on @xmath50 and @xmath39 over a ( finite ) time horizon @xmath51 .",
    "choosing @xmath0 to be large , e.g. @xmath52 where @xmath20 is the complete optimization period , results in two major disadvantages.the first one is that the number of possible combinations of the discretized binary switching signal @xmath39 grows exponentially with the number of loads @xmath6 and the number of time steps @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , this can be significantly reduced by the requirement of minimum on / off duration times @xmath19 for the loads.as mentioned before , this avoids unrealistic on / off chattering of the switch signal @xmath17 during load scheduling and significantly reduces the number of binary load combinations .",
    "the second disadvantage of choosing @xmath0 to be large requires the discrete - time power profile @xmath53 to be available over many time samples to plan for optimal load scheduling , which leads to increasingly suboptimal schedules due to increasing solar forecast errors .      with the imposed time discretization given in [ eq : ni ] , and a finite prediction horizon @xmath0 ,",

    "persistence and advection forecast methods are associated with erroneous predictions .",
    "persistence errors are due to the deviation from the initial cloud state , which generally increases in time .",

    "two metrics are considered to evaluate the accuracy of the control algorithms .",
    "the first metric is the number of time steps with pe while the second one is called energy exceedence ( ee ) and is equal to integration of pe at the consecutive violated time steps .",

    "we see that the persistence forecast leads to higher exceedance and more violations for all _ k_. increasing _ k _ in general also leads to an increase in exceedance and violations .",
    "if we evaluated solar forecast or control algorithms solely based on pe , then a forecast that is biased small ( or even always zero ) would improve the results as less and/or smaller loads would be scheduled . therefore a different metric such as efficiency is important to observe .",

    "k _ ( and is much lower than the non - equal case ) , and the advective forecast always captures more energy than the persistence forecast . we can conclude that the nonlinear behavior seen in non - equal units across increasing _",
    "k _ is due to the dynamics associated with starting and shutting down the loads .",
    "+ energy storage systems such as batteries could help overcome ee episodes as well as increase the efficiency .",
    "the excess of energy that is not captured by the loads ( figures [ compare],[efficiency ] ) could be stored and used to power loads during ee events . for battery sizing one could consider match the energy capacity of the battery to the energy required for maximum exceedance of the largest unit over its minimum required on - time .",
    "however , figure [ overreach ] demonstrates that the maximum individual ee for all cases is a small percentage the power of even the smallest unit .",
