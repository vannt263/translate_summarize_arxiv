    "we use this optimized tag data when performing our temporal and spectral analyses of this event .",
    "figure 2 shows the light curve of xrf 020903 in four wxm energy bands .",
    "the time history of the burst in the 2 - 5 and 5 - 10 kev energy bands has two peaks .",

    "the duration of the burst is longer in the lower energy band ; this trend is similar to that seen in long bright grbs @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the light curve of xrf 020903 shows two peaks : the first occurring in the time interval 0 - 8 s , and the second occurring in the time interval 8 - 13 s. the s / n of the first peak is much higher than that of the second .",
    "in addition , inspection of the burst light curve in the 2 - 5 and 5 - 10 kev energy bands suggests that the second peak is much softer than the first . for these reasons ,",
    "we analyze the spectrum of the burst in three time intervals : 0 - 8  s , 8 - 13  s , and the total duration of the burst , 0 - 13  s. the background region we use is 40 seconds in duration and starts 45 seconds before the burst .",
    "the wxm detector response matrix has been well - calibrated using observations of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "in the spectral fits , we include only the photons that registered on the four wires in the x - detectors and the five wires in the y - detectors that were illuminated by the burst , as mentioned above .",
    "since the variation in the gain is not uniform at the ends of the wires in the wxm detectors @xcite , we use only the photon counts that registered in the central @xmath4250 mm region of the wires to construct the spectra of the burst .",
    "we include all of the photons that register in the central regions of these wires ( i.e , we use the full 2 - 25 kev energy range of the wxm ) .",
    "the relation between pulse height and energy in the wxm is non - linear and is different for each wire . in order to extract the strongest possible constraints on the parameters of the spectral models we consider , we treat each individual wxm wire separately but take the normalizations on all wires to be the same . for the same reason , we do not re - bin any of the pulse height channels in the wxm and in the fregate , and we carry out a set of fits for the total duration of the burst ( 0 - 13 s ) that include the spectral data from both the wxm and the fregate .",
    "we use the xspec v11.2.0 software package to do the spectral fits .",
    "table 2 presents the results of our time - resolved and time - integrated spectral analysis of the burst . in this analysis",
    ", we consider the following models : ( 1 ) blackbody , ( 2 ) power - law model , ( 3 ) power - law times exponential ( ple ) [ the comp model in @xcite ] , and ( 4 ) band function @xcite .",
    "the galactic value of @xmath43 in the direction of the burst is @xmath44 @xmath21 @xcite , which is negligible ( i.e. , it is undetectable in the wxm energy range ) .",
    "furthermore , the wxm and fregate data do not request @xmath43 as a free parameter ( i.e. , introducing @xmath43 as an additional free parameter produces only a small change in @xmath45 ) .",
    "there is therefore no need to include @xmath43 as a parameter in the spectral fits , and we do not do so . in the band model fits , we have fixed @xmath46 , which is a typical value for grbs , in order to better constrain the remaining parameters .",
    "all of the models provide acceptable fits to the data ; i.e. , the data do not request models more complicated than a blackbody or a power - law .",
    "however , essentially all grb spectra are well - described by the band function @xcite , and the analysis of @xcite shows that at least some xrf spectra are also well - described by the band function",
    ". fits to the wxm data for all three time intervals using the power - law model give spectral slopes @xmath47 with high significance .",
    "for example , comparing the minimum value @xmath48 corresponding to the best - fit value of the spectral slope @xmath49 and the value @xmath50 at @xmath51 for the power - law fit to the average spectrum of the burst ( i.e. , the time interval 0 - 13 s ) , we find that @xmath52 for one additional parameter .",
    "thus , using the maximum likelihood ratio test , @xmath47 at the 99.3% confidence level . from this evidence ,",
    "we conclude that the peak @xmath11 in @xmath53 lies near or below 2 kev , the lower limit of the energy range of the wxm detectors .",
    "there is evidence of spectral softening between the first and second time intervals . in particular",
    ", a power - law fit to the first time interval gives @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while a power - law fit to the second time interval gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , a power - law fit to the first and second time intervals , but with @xmath58 gives @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the first ( more complicated ) model includes the second model as a special case ( i.e. , the models are nested ) .",
    "comparing @xmath61 for the two models , we find that @xmath62 for one additional parameter .",
    "thus , using the maximum likelihood ratio test , there is evidence of spectral softening at the 98.6% confidence level .",
    "figure 3 shows a comparison of the observed count spectrum and the count spectrum predicted by the best - fit power - law model , for the time intervals 0 - 8 s and 8 - 13s .",
    "figure 4 shows the same comparison , except for the total duration of the burst ( 0 - 13 s ) .",
    "table 3 gives the peak photon number and energy fluxes ( in 1 s ) and the fluence of xrf 020903 , assuming the power - law model .",
    "using the power - law model that best fits the burst - averaged wxm plus fregate spectral data , we find fluences @xmath63 erg @xmath21 and @xmath64 erg @xmath21 where the quoted errors give the 90% confidence intervals .",
    "thus the ratio of fluences @xmath65 = 0.7 $ ] , with a 90% lower limit of 0.3 , making this burst not only an xrf but the most extreme example of an xrf observed so far by hete-2 .",
    "a comparison of the power - law and band function fits to the first peak , which has a much higher s / n than the second peak , provides modest evidence for an @xmath66 near 2 kev , the lower limit of the energy range of the wxm detectors .",
    "specifically , we find that@xmath67 for one additional parameter , which means that the data requests the ( more complicated ) band function model at the 89% confidence level .",
    "however , the evidence is clearly not of high statistical significance , and in this fit we fixed @xmath13 at @xmath231 , its typical value for grbs .",
    "we therefore choose to place an upper limit on @xmath68 .",
    "the appropriate model to use is the band function , since ( as we have already mentioned ) the spectra of almost all grbs and at least some xrfs are well - described by this function .",
    "however , this presents a problem : the band function has two distinct ways of representing a power - law spectrum in the detector energy range .",
    "first , it can do so by having @xmath69 , so that only the high - energy , pure power - law part of the band function is visible in the energy range of the detector .",
    "second , it can do so by having @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the `` cutoff energy '' of the cutoff power - law that constitutes the low - energy part of the band function . in this limit",
    ", the limiting power - law is actually the cutoff power - law , but the cutoff energy is so large that the curvature of the model is imperceptible in the detector energy range .",
    "we solve this problem by developing a new statistical method .",
    "this method uses a _ constrained _ band function which is parameterized by two quantities , @xmath66 and @xmath18 .",
    "the _ constrained _ band function is perfectly able to make both pure power - law spectra and power - law times exponential spectra of the required curvature in the detector energy range , but only the high - energy part of the band function is allowed to produce a pure power - law spectrum .",
    "we describe this new method in detail in appendix a. this method has general applicability to all instruments when the spectra of the bursts considered have @xmath66 near or below the low - energy threshold of the detector .",
    "it is necessary to demonstrate that the photon index @xmath73 before applying this method .",
    "in applying the constrained band function method to xrf 020903 , we jointly fit the wxm and the fregate data .",
    "figure 5 shows the posterior probability density distribution for @xmath66 that we find using this approach . from this posterior probability density distribution",
    ", we find a best - fit value @xmath74 kev , that @xmath75 with 68% probabilty , and that @xmath76 4.1 and 5.0 kev with 95% and 99.7% probabilities , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the properties of xrf 020903 are very similar to those of long grbs , with the exception that the observed peak energy @xmath77 kev is @xmath78 times smaller .",
    "the extremely low value of @xmath5 seen in xrf 020903 is similar to the smallest value found among the 9 xrfs whose spectra were determined by jointly fitting _",
    "beppo_sax wfc and batse data @xcite .",
    "we exclude the possibility that xrf 020903 is a type i x - ray burst ( xrb ) on the following grounds .",
    "first , its galactic latitude is @xmath79 ( using the center of the combined wxm plus sxc error box ) , and there is no known persistent x - ray source or globular cluster in this error box . since type i x - ray burst sources lie in the galactic plane or in globular clusters , and have persistent x - ray emission , xrf 020903 is unlikely to be an x - ray burst on locational grounds alone .",
    "second , the time history of xrf 020903 is not fred - like ( i.e. , it does not exhibit a fast rise and an exponential decay ) , while those of xrbs typically are .",
    "third , although the blackbody model gives an acceptable fit to the spectra of the first and second peaks in the time history of xrf 020903 , the derived blackbody temperatures are @xmath4 1.0 kev .",
    "these temperatures are lower than those of almost all type i x - ray bursts [ which typically have temperatures @xmath80  kev ; see , e.g. @xcite ] . for these reasons , we conclude that xrf 020903 is an xrf and not an xrb .",
    "the extremely low value of @xmath66 observed for xrf 020903 is remarkable .",
    "if the observed spectrum of xrf 020903 were the redshifted spectrum of a typical grb , the implied redshift would be @xmath81 , using the best - fit value of @xmath82 kev observed for xrf 020903 and the mean value of @xmath83 for the sample of 5500 spectra formed from the brightest 156 batse grbs @xcite",
    ". a redshift of this magnitude would be hard to understand , and is certainly not expected if long grbs are associated with the collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "it is also wildly inconsistent with the measured redshift @xmath8 of the host galaxy @xcite of the candidate optical @xcite and radio @xcite afterglows of xrf 020903 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to attribute the low observed value of @xmath66 for xrf 020903 to cosmological redshift .      in figure 6 ,",
    "we plot xrf 020903 in the ( @xmath84,@xmath85)-plane , where @xmath86 and @xmath84 are the energy fluences of the bursts in the 7 - 30 and 30 - 400 kev energy bands .",
    "for the value of @xmath86 and @xmath84 , we use the best - fit power - law model for the average spectrum of wxm and fregate .",
    "also plotted in this figure are the 35 grbs whose spectra have been determined using hete-2 fregate data @xcite .",

    "therefore that the redshift of the underlying host galaxy is the redshift of the xrf , we can calculate the isotropic - equivalent radiated energy @xmath10 and the upper limit on the burst - averaged peak energy @xmath11 of the @xmath12 spectrum in the source frame , in the same way as did @xcite .",

    "xrfs are the result of viewing the jet of an ordinary grb off - axis , so that relativistic beaming shifts the @xmath19-rays into the x - ray range . in the clean fireball model ,",

    "in the spectral analysis of grbs , one occasionally encounters events ( such as xrf 020903 ) that are so soft that they present themselves as pure power - laws with power - law index @xmath73 in the energy range of the detector .",
    "the natural interpretation of such spectra is that the break energy @xmath96 separating the two functional parts of the band function is near or below the lower boundary of the detector energy range .",

    "this situation is particularly a problem for the estimation of @xmath101 .",

    "we define the three - dimensional subspace in the following way : consider a band function parametrized by low- and high - energy indices @xmath13 and @xmath18 , and by a cutoff energy @xmath72 .",
    "the well - known relation between @xmath72 and @xmath96 is @xmath103 .",
    "we impose the constraint condition on our family of fitting functions @xmath104 where @xmath105 is some suitably chosen energy , in the general neighborhood where the grb has appreciable emission . @xmath96 and @xmath72 are then inversely related , and are equal to each other when both are equal to @xmath105 .      on the other hand , when @xmath108 , then @xmath109 , and as @xmath71 , @xmath110 . in other words ,",
    "when the low - energy part of the band function is trying to imitate a power law , the break energy becomes small enough to force the low - energy part of the function below the energy range of interest , where it can not be seen and therefore can do no harm .",
    "any pure power - law work must thus be done by the high - energy part of the band function .",
    "the resulting spectral function has three parameters ( including the scale ) , rather than four .",
    "the two input shape parameters can be chosen arbitrarily from the set \\{@xmath13 , @xmath18 , @xmath72 , @xmath96 , @xmath11}. the remaining parameters may then be determined by algebraic relationships .",
    "we have found it most convenient to adopt @xmath11 and @xmath18 as our parameters .",
    "the choice of @xmath11 is dictated by the necessity of estimating its value , or at least an upper bound on its value .",
    "the choice of @xmath18 is convenient because one may then impose the parameter bound @xmath73 , which guarantees that the formal expression for @xmath11 may be meaningfully interpreted as the energy of the peak of the @xmath12 distribution .",
    "this bound on @xmath18 is an important part of the specification of the fitting family of models .",
    "were it not imposed , it would be possible for the formal expression for @xmath11 to exceed @xmath96 , so that at large values of @xmath11 the fit could always produce a @xmath111 power - law in the detector energy range .",
    "the result would be an extended tail of constant @xmath45 for arbitrarily large values of @xmath11 .",
    "figure 9 shows the constrained band function , with @xmath112 and @xmath113  kev , for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath11 increases , @xmath96 also necessarily increases , so that @xmath72 is forced to smaller and smaller values by the constraint , which increases the curvature ( and the value of @xmath13 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the constrained band function , with @xmath114  kev and @xmath113  kev , for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "the progression from some curvature at low energy ( @xmath115 ) to almost none ( @xmath116 ) is evident , as is the fact that as the curvature disappears , the resulting power - law is produced by the high - energy part of the band function .",
    "figures 9 and 10 show that the constrained band function is perfectly able to make both pure power - laws , and cutoff power - laws with any desired curvature in the detector energy range .",
    "figure 10 demonstrates that , in the constrained band function , a power - law spectrum is always produced by the high - energy part of the band function .      1",
    ".   @xmath105 must be low enough to prevent the low - energy part of the band function from making a power - law in the energy range of interest .",
    "if @xmath105 were 1 gev ( say ) , then the band function would have no difficulty making @xmath72 large and @xmath117 , which is what we are trying to prevent by introducing the constraint .",
    "so @xmath105 should be `` as low as possible .",
    "@xmath105 must not be so low that we can not adequately fit any curvature that may exist in the spectrum .",
    "if @xmath105 were 1  ev ( say ) , then whenever @xmath96 was in or above the energy range where the spectrum is appreciable , @xmath72 would be so tiny that the curvature of the model would be huge , much too large to fit the data well .",
    "one way of choosing @xmath105 is to calculate its value using the best - fit parameters from a fit of a _",
    "free _ band function , using @xmath118 .",
    "this choice , which effectively chooses the unique constrained subspace of the full parameter space that contains the best - fit free band function , allows the constrained family of functions to optimally fit whatever curvature the data may seem to hint is required .",
    "we must require that the inferences that we draw from the spectral fit should be robust , in the sense that they should not depend strongly on the specific choice of @xmath105 .",
    "so the proper use of this constrained band model involves not only choosing a representative value of @xmath105 , but also varying @xmath105 in some reasonable range , to make sure that the conclusions about parameter estimates and bounds are unaffected by the choice of @xmath105",
    ".    figure 11 shows the constrained band function , with @xmath114  kev and @xmath119 , for different values of @xmath105 .",
    "once again , as the low - energy curvature disappears , the resulting power - law is produced by the high - energy part of the band function .",
    "figure 11 also shows that the shape of the spectrum in the detector energy range is insensitive to the specific choice of @xmath105 , within a reasonable range .",
    "thus the conclusions about parameter estimates and bounds are unaffected by the choice of @xmath105 .",
    "figure 12 shows the constrained band functions with parameters that best fit the 13  s spectrum of xrf 020903 , for different fixed values of @xmath105 .",
    "this figure illustrates the fact that the shape of the best - fit model is essentially unchanged in the energy range of the wxm for choices of @xmath105 within a reasonable range .",
    "    finally , we give the algebraic relationships necessary to recover the remaining band function parameters assuming that @xmath11 and @xmath18 are given .",
    "let @xmath120 .",
    "then , @xmath121 in equation ( [ alpha ] ) , we have resolved the ambiguity in the choice of root of a quadratic equation by requiring that when @xmath122 , then @xmath123 , so that @xmath11 is in fact the peak energy of the @xmath12 distribution .",
