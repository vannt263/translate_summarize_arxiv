    "mira and semi - regular variable stars have been observed almost continuously for centuries since the discovery by fabricius in 1596 that the prototype was variable ; although there is some evidence that variability was detected by earlier civilizations ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sahade & wood , 1978 ) ) .",
    "these continuous observations have been important for the understanding of stellar pulsation and shedding insight into the theory of stellar evolution ( ( * ? ? ? * uttenthaler et al .",
    "furthermore , the continuous observations have detected irregular pulsation in many evolved red giant stars .",
    "mira variable stars are also important standard candles , that can be employed to measure distances to other galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whitelock et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "another probe to explore the structure and evolution of mira variable stars is using linear polarization observations to probe asymmetric stellar properties ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* serkowski & shawl 2001 ) ) .",
    "we present polarization and position angle observations of the prototype mira and the semi - regular variable star v  cvn .",
    "these quantities are derived from observed stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters , where the polarization @xmath2,and the position angle @xmath3 . using these parameters",
    "we explore asymmetric stellar structures , i.e. , deviations from circular symmetry of the radiation field .    , in degrees ;",

    "@xmath9 for v  cvn with a nearly constant value of @xmath5 spanning 40 years .",
    "we suggest that the polarization and position angle measurements for v  cvn is consistent with the structure of a circumstellar disk ( neilson et al .",
    "submitted ) , whereas the polarization for mira is due to convective hot spots ( ignace et al . in prep ) .",
    "we are also exploring polarization measurements of other mira and semi - regular variable stars , such as r leo .",
    "there are about 20 such stars in the hpol database .",
    "however , none of the other stars in the hpol database have detect polarization at similar levels as v  cvn . only the star l@xmath10 pup appears to have similar polarization ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* magalhes et al . 1986b ) ) , suggesting that circumstellar disks about these stars is rare but is consistent with observations of disks about white dwarf stars ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we continue to observe v  cvn , mira and a sample of variables in the northern hemisphere using the lulin one - meter telescope in taiwan .",
