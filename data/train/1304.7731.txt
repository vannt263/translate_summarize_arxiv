    "<S> we rely on neutron scattering experiments @xcite showing liquid h@xmath2 on graphene at @xmath7 14 - 34 k tends to have short - range order commensurate with the underlying lattice , meaning the strong influence of the corrugation persists at high density . </S>",

    "<S> the maximum @xmath21 at any width was @xmath41% , equivalent to one commensurate lattice on each side of the pore .    </S>",
    "<S> the pair correlation function for two particles in the sc condensate at this maximum density is shown in figure [ energies](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite similar to that of bulk liquid h@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the major exception is the behavior at @xmath42  ; this difference originates from the mean field approximation . ) as a result , the interaction of two h@xmath2 in this state is much smaller than for any other pair of states .    even though the single - particle sc state is always higher in energy than the single - particle ground state ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ energies](c ) ) , the tendency of the sc state to reduce the interaction energy means that a condensate in this state becomes the many - body ground state as density increases ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> but it is only within a narrower range , centered around @xmath43 8  , that the energy difference between the sc state and a thermal distribution is large enough ( fig . [ energies](d ) ) to form a condensate at temperatures above the melting point of h@xmath2 . in this range , </S>",
    "<S> the intermolecular interaction and the sc state are closely enough in phase to reduce the interaction energy significantly .    </S>",

    "<S> the number of these states which are thermally accessible and thus likely to be occupied at @xmath39 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .    </S>",
    "<S> the canonical partition function was computed for a condensate in the sc state , @xmath47 where we have interpolated between calculated values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as as function of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> bose - einstein statistics ( bes ) are incorporated by properly counting the number of microstates for each macrostate @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ par ] gives the number of ways to arrange @xmath44 indistinguishable bosons over @xmath49 states . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the number of ways to arrange @xmath29 indistinguishable bosons in the sc state is equal to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that while this method correctly uses bes to compute the balance between @xmath29 and @xmath44 , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ thermal ] & [ dos ] use maxwell - boltzmann statistics to compute the distribution of @xmath44 particles over the @xmath49 states . </S>",
    "<S> this is justified by the fact that for every set of parameters studied , @xmath51 . a similar condition , @xmath52 , justifies use of the classical canonical ensemble for a free three dimensional gas @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the condensate fraction ( @xmath53 ) , average system energy , and specific heat were computed from the partition function @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    figure [ cond ] shows the condensate fraction @xmath60 , average energy per particle , and specific heat as a function of @xmath39 for several pore widths at a density of @xmath41 % . unlike a typical bec </S>",
    "<S> , there is no simple definition for the critical temperature @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the condensate fraction has a strong dependence on @xmath21 ( not shown ) , with condensation only occurring at high density , @xmath62 % , where the interaction energy is significant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the specific heat ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cond](c ) ) has the same characteristic cusp as a typical bec , and falls toward the constant of a classical two - dimensional gas at @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the @xmath60 never reaches 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the energy is roughly constant above a critical value of @xmath60 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ energies](f ) . above this point , the mean field of the condensate pulls all other states into similar forms which also minimize interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have not included exchange in calculations , a factor which tends to favor condensation in a single state @xcite .    for the larger pores studied , @xmath69.3  </S>",
    "<S> , the ac state is lowest in energy at high density , but the energy difference is not enough to form a condensate . because the properties of larger pores approach those of independent graphene sheets , this result is consistent with studies of liquid h@xmath2 on graphene which have found no evidence of condensation or superfluidity @xcite except below the melting temperature with impurities @xcite .    at first glance </S>",
    "<S> , several objections could be made to our claim of high @xmath0 bose - einstein condensation in this quasi - two dimensional ( 2d ) system . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we claim to see a bec at temperatures up to 60 k. but at this temperature , the thermal de broglie wavelength @xcite or `` quantum size '' of a hydrogen molecule is @xmath64  , much smaller than the average separation between the particles in liquid h@xmath2 , 3.7  . </S>",
    "<S> thus the wavefunctions of adjacent particles should not overlap , and a bec should not form . however , the de broglie wavelength is not an intrinsic property of a particle that is independent of its environment , but is derived @xcite from the dos . </S>",
    "<S> because of the large gap in energy between the sc state and the other states in this system , there are fewer thermally accessible states , reducing the dos and increasing @xmath46 so that a bec may form at higher temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it is generally accepted that becs do not form in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> this was rigorously proven @xcite by considering the phonon spectrum in a 2d system with continuous translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> as the phonon wavelengths approach infinity , their energies approach zero , leading to an infrared divergence in the phonon spectrum in 2d which tends to break the condensate apart . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the long wavelength phonons tend to move macroscopically large sections of the condensate together </S>",
    "<S> . however , the system discussed here has _ </S>",
    "<S> discrete _ translational symmetry , and moving the condensate moves the h@xmath2 out of the minima in the graphene potential . </S>",
    "<S> thus the energy of long - wavelength phonons approaches a finite constant , and there is no infrared divergence .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that because the @xmath65 condense into a single quantum state ( sc state ) , the system has off - diagonal long range order , with the _ average _ value of the first - order coherence function @xmath66 approaching a finite value as @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> but because of the natural periodicity of the sc state , @xmath66 is not constant , but oscillates .    </S>",
    "<S> here we have described a new mechanism for creating a bose - einstein condensate whose critical temperature is an order of magnitude higher than other becs formed from real particles . </S>",
    "<S> development of high @xmath0 becs would reduce the sophistication and cost of the cooling techniques required , and also permit higher densities by eliminating the need of super - cooling . </S>",
    "<S> because the confining potential described here is solid state ( thus static ) and evaporative cooling is not required , there should also be no limitation on the lifetime of the condensate .    while we have presented calculations for a high @xmath0 bec of h@xmath2 in graphene pores , other species and/or potentials </S>",
    "<S> may be substituted , as long as the same basic concept is employed : the periodicity of the potential and the inter - particle interactions must be tuned together so that a small subset of quantum states minimize the interactions . in particular , if this new bec can be created from molecules in an optical lattice @xcite with tunable interactions @xcite , the resultant system would have the advantages of a high @xmath0 bec , in addition to the controllability and lack of defects of an optical lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> an optical version could also be studied with simple light scattering rather than neutron scattering @xcite , as required for the opaque h@xmath2-graphene system .    </S>",
    "<S> even with the limitaions of real materials , the h@xmath2-graphene system may provide immediate benefits for hydrogen storage @xcite and sorption cryo - coolers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a high @xmath0 optical version might someday be useful for large scale , cost - effective applications like quantum computing which can not feasibly operate at ultra - cold temperatures . </S>"
