    "in quantum optics , a common experimental situation involves a system in a cavity which is monitored by measuring the spectrum of output photons . in order to compare theory to experiment",
    "it is necessary to calculate this output spectrum .",
    "what is commonly found is that the intensity of the output spectrum is given by the fourier transform of two - time correlation functions of system variables @xcite . in the case of a system isolated from its environment ( apart from the measurement process itself ) , these correlation functions are simply the expectation values of products of heisenberg operators at different times , e.g. , @xmath0 .",
    "as it is difficult to completely isolate a system from the environment , this approach does not always succeed . in the case of a quantum open system interacting continually with an external reservoir , one",
    "instead describes the system by a master equation , which - within the markov approximation - can be written in lindblad form : @xmath1 + \\sum_m \\biggl ( l_m \\rho l_m\\d    - { 1\\over2 } \\",
    "{ l_m\\d l_m , \\rho \\ } \\biggr ) .",
    "\\label{master_eqn}\\ ] ] the @xmath2 are a set of environment operators which give the collective effects of the environment , and we have taken @xmath3 .",
    "the density operator @xmath4 gives the probability for the expected outcomes of measurements on the system . in this case",
    ", one can still calculate output spectra , and find fourier transforms of time correlation functions ; these are no longer the expectation values of products of heisenberg operators in the system hilbert space alone , but are more complicated objects whose form is given by the quantum regression theorem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for complicated systems equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) can be very difficult to solve either analytically or numerically . in that case",
    ", it is often advantageous to consider an unraveling of the master equation into individual quantum trajectories , each one represented by a single state at every moment in time .",
    "one of these unraveling techniques is quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) @xcite . in this",
    ", the normalized vector @xmath5 representing the pure state of the system evolves according to the qsd equation : @xmath6 @xmath7 this is an it stochastic differential equation , in which the @xmath8 represent independent complex wiener processes .",
    "these satisfy @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents an ensemble average of the noise .",
    "qsd reproduces the master equation in the mean : @xmath11 ( this is what is meant by an unraveling of the master equation . ) expectation values for operators obey a similar relationship : @xmath12    the use of qsd as a practical algorithm to solve master equations has been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "this includes calculations of output spectra in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "while it seems reasonable that there should be a relationship between output spectra and time correlation functions in qsd analogous to that in schrdinger or master equation dynamics , this has been difficult to show , as there is no generally accepted definition of a time correlation function for a single qsd trajectory . since qsd is framed in terms of a nonlinear stochastic differential equation for an evolving state , it is not obvious how to generalize this to products of operators at different times .",
    "gisin @xcite has attempted to provide a heisenberg picture for stochastically evolving operators .",
    "sondermann @xcite , using the same stochastic equations , has suggested another definition for time correlation functions . in both cases",
    "it is difficult to relate this to the usual qsd formalism . in this paper",
    "we attempt to find a definition which arises from the qsd equation itself .    in section 2",
    "we derive the output spectrum of a quantum mechanical system , and show its relationship to time correlation functions , as given by the quantum regression theorem .    in section 3",
    "we derive a quantum output spectrum using qsd , and show how it leads to a natural definition of a two - time correlation function for a single qsd trajectory .",
    "unlike the correlation functions which arise in the master equation derivation , these qsd functions depend explicitly on the measurement time and the noise . on average , however , these dependencies vanish , and the result agrees with the usual definition of a time correlation function .    in section 4 we look briefly at alternative unravelings , and discuss the use of these techniques for the practical computation of spectra .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize our results and draw conclusions .",
    "consider a rather idealized model of an experimental set - up for measuring the output spectrum of a quantum mechanical system .",
    "suppose we have a system with hamiltonian @xmath13 and hilbert space @xmath14 weakly coupled to an output mode with hamiltonian @xmath15 and hilbert space @xmath16 .",
    "we assume weak coupling to minimize the perturbation of the system evolution . for simplicity",
    "we assume a linear interaction : @xmath17 where the operator @xmath18 represents a physical quantity of the system , like position for example , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the annihilation and creation operators for the output mode , and @xmath21 is small .    the total hamiltonian of the system plus output mode is @xmath22 and operates on the combined hilbert space @xmath23 .",
    "let the system degrees of freedom also be coupled to an environment , described by a set of environment operators @xmath2 acting on @xmath14 .",
    "the system plus output mode obeys the master equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) with hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "if the output mode is initially in the ground state , so that the initial density matrix is of the form @xmath24 , we can approximate at later times @xmath25 where the @xmath26 are time - dependent operators on @xmath14 ; we have explicitly separated the system and output mode degrees of freedom and neglected all but the first excited state of the output mode .",
    "we then have @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and can rewrite equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) in the form @xmath29 @xmath30 is the time evolution superoperator restricted to the system degrees of freedom : @xmath31 + \\sum_m \\biggl ( l_m \\rho_{ij } l_m\\d    - \\half \\ { l_m\\d l_m , \\rho_{ij } \\ } \\biggr ) .",
    "\\label{lsystem}\\ ] ] to lowest order , @xmath32 evolves according to a normal master equation , with no reference to the output mode at all .",
    "the other components @xmath26 represent the weak signal transmitted via the interaction with the output mode .",
    "we can solve these equations : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the time evolution superoperator from time @xmath38 to time @xmath39 given by ( [ lsystem ] ) .",
    "the excitation of the output mode is what is measured , so we are interested in the expectation value @xmath40 .",
    "we find this by taking the trace of equation ( [ output_mode ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) preserves the trace , so in taking the trace of ( [ output_mode ] ) the factor @xmath41 has no effect , and may be dropped .",
    "thus , @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where the last equality defines the two - time correlation function @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is determined by the evolution operator @xmath46 of the reduced mixed state @xmath32 , in accordance with the quantum regression theorem @xcite .",
    "we see that the expected output has the form of a fourier transform of a two - time correlation function ; this is just like the result in classical physics @xcite . examining output modes at different frequencies",
    "@xmath47 gives the spectrum of the system .",
    "we can calculate the results of section 2 with qsd by using relation ( [ qsd_expectation ] ) .",
    "we solve the qsd equation ( [ qsd_eqn ] ) for a state in the combined hilbert space @xmath48 , starting with an initial condition @xmath49 . by averaging @xmath50 over many trajectories",
    "we reproduce ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "this was done in @xcite for the case of second harmonic generation .",
    "how can we interpret @xmath50 for a _ single _ trajectory ?",
    "let s examine a little more closely the evolution ( [ qsd_eqn ] ) .",
    "we can separate the components of @xmath51 @xmath52 where we again neglect all excited states of the output mode above the first .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath53 the qsd equation becomes a pair of coupled equations @xmath54 @xmath55 note that ( [ system_eqn ] ) is identical to the usual qsd equation for the system alone to first order in @xmath21 . just as in section 2",
    ", this approximation gains an extra order of @xmath21 in accuracy for free .",
    "thus , the system degrees of freedom have the usual quantum state diffusion behavior , essentially uninfluenced by the interaction with the output mode . exactly as in ( [ component_eqns ] ) , we have an almost unperturbed system , with a weak signal transmitted to the outside world .",
    "equation ( [ output_eqn ] ) is interesting , in that all of the expectation values in this equation are calculated with respect to @xmath56 , so this is a driven linear equation with time - dependent coefficients . given the solution @xmath57 , we can find @xmath58 , at least in principle .",
    "we formally integrate ( [ system_eqn ] ) to get @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the time - evolution operator from time @xmath38 to time @xmath39 .",
    "it explicitly depends on the noise @xmath61 and the initial state @xmath62 , since the qsd equation is nonlinear .",
    "given this time - evolution operator , the solution to ( [ output_eqn ] ) is @xmath63 the output spectrum is then @xmath64 where the @xmath61 and @xmath65 have been suppressed for conciseness .",
    "this expression resembles a fourier transform of some kind of correlation function , just as was the case in section 2 ; but this correlation function is defined for a single qsd trajectory .",
    "we can bring this rather closer to the treatment in section 2 by introducing the projector @xmath66 where these _ partial projectors _ @xmath67 are operators on @xmath14 .",
    "these are related to our earlier treatment by @xmath68 and to section 2 by @xmath69 these @xmath67 are not themselves projectors ; however , @xmath70 , and therefore can be considered a projector to good approximation .",
    "we define a time evolution superoperator for these partial projectors @xmath71 this is related to the superoperator for the master equation by @xmath72 we shall need the following solutions : @xmath73 @xmath74 in order to compute the output signal @xmath75 we make use of the equality : @xmath76 in this way , we obtain the following expression for the output signal : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 note that the two central operators @xmath80 can not be replaced with @xmath81 .    accordingly ,",
    "in analogy with ( [ spectrum ] ) we define a _ measurement - dependent _ two - time correlation function for qsd : @xmath82 note that this assumes @xmath83 ; for @xmath84 an analogous expression can be formed .",
    "this function @xmath85 in qsd has the nice feature that it is the trace of a product of two operators , each involving one of the times @xmath38 and @xmath39 , similar to correlation functions of classical stochastic processes ( which are products of the random variables at different times @xcite ) .",
    "however , it also has the strange feature that the `` final '' time @xmath86 appears in this definition .",
    "this is why we term @xmath85 a measurement - dependent correlation function , rather than a true correlation function .",
    "note that in perfect analogy with the quantum regression theorem , @xmath87 is determined by the evolution operator @xmath88 of the reduced system s pure state @xmath57 .",
    "it remains to establish the relation between the function @xmath87 and the qrt correlation function introduced in section 2 .",
    "for this purpose we note that @xmath89 provides an equivalent expression for the output signal : @xmath90 @xmath91 using this relation ( [ timecorr2 ] ) we can derive an equivalent form of the function @xmath85 : @xmath92 @xmath93 note that in section 2 it was possible to remove the time evolution superoperator @xmath94 , as it did not affect the trace .",
    "this is not true in the single trajectory case , as explained above ; so the function @xmath85 depends explicitly on time , as mentioned above .",
    "nevertheless , taking the mean over the noise of @xmath87 , one recovers the correlation function derived for mixed states from the quantum regression theorem : @xmath95 note that the dependence on the final time @xmath86 vanishes in the mean .    while the definition ( [ qsd_correlation ] ) arises naturally in this derivation , and has the correct average behavior , its dependence on @xmath86 remains a puzzling and rather annoying feature .",
    "it is possible to make a different definition , closely related to that of ( [ qsd_correlation ] ) , which avoids this problem . since the operator @xmath96 in the definition ( [ qsd_correlation2 ] ) vanishes in the mean , we can define a true two - time correlation function : @xmath97 in this way the `` final time '' @xmath86 disappears and the correlation function is formally identical to the qrt case ( but for vectors instead of matrices ) .",
    "moreover , the correlation function then appears as a scalar product of two vectors : @xmath98    one can consider this new definition to be an average over `` future '' noise , i.e. , noise after @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath99 certainly , this once again reproduces the qrt correlation function in the mean , and gives exactly the same @xmath75 for a single trajectory : @xmath100    while this definition removes the dependence on the final time @xmath86 , this two - time correlation function still has some interesting features , related to the fact that the qsd time - evolution superoperator ( [ qsd_superoperator ] ) does not preserve the trace .",
    "in particular , we note that if the second operator @xmath101 is the identity @xmath102 , then @xmath103 contrary to the case of the qrt . if @xmath104 no such difficulty arises .",
    "since unravelings of the master equation do not generically preserve the trace , this feature will arise in any similar derivation .",
    "this might be one argument for using an unraveling specifically chosen to preserve the trace , such as that used by gisin in his discussion of a heisenberg picture for qsd @xcite . in any case",
    ", the desired relation does hold in the mean : @xmath105 fortunately , correlation functions of the above form would not arise in any physically reasonable measurement scheme , since @xmath102 does not describe an interaction .",
    "the definition of the two - time correlation function ( [ qsd_correlation3 ] ) , and its relation to the quantum regression theorem ( [ theorem2 ] ) are the main results of this article .",
    "the central line of arguments can be summarized as follows : @xmath106",
    "while the definition ( [ qsd_correlation3 ] ) arises naturally from the qsd analysis of this problem , it is not the only possible definition of a time correlation function for a single trajectory ; indeed , there are an infinite number of such definitions , corresponding to different unravelings @xcite",
    ".    one such alternative unraveling has already been proposed by gisin as a possible definition of a time - correlation function for individual trajectories , as well as providing a sort of heisenberg picture corresponding to qsd @xcite . here",
    "we will suggest yet another such alternative unraveling .",
    "in particular , rather than solving the lindblad master equation itself and then solving for the output spectrum , one might instead begin with the expression ( [ spectrum ] ) and attempt to unravel the time - correlation function directly .",
    "what form would such an unraveling take ?",
    "in qsd , one unravels the density operator evolution into many trajectories , each consisting of a single state , and with a mean @xmath107 .",
    "this works because @xmath4 is hermitian : @xmath108 . for a time correlation function",
    ", this is no longer sufficient .",
    "the form given by the quantum regression theorem is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the time - evolution superoperator defined by the master equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) ; however , the `` initial state '' @xmath111 is _ not _ hermitian .",
    "therefore the evolution from @xmath38 to @xmath39 can not be unraveled in terms of pure states .",
    "one can , however , consider a pair of vectors @xmath5 and @xmath112 such that @xmath113 _ does _ reproduce the correct evolution .",
    "such a _ diad _ equation is quite analogous to the usual qsd equation .",
    "one pair of coupled equations that do the job are @xmath114 it is not hard to show that @xmath115 so this has the correct evolution in the mean . if @xmath116 then these coupled equations reduce to the ordinary qsd equation ( [ qsd_eqn ] ) .",
    "note that in general , however , the normalization of @xmath5 and @xmath112 is _ not _ preserved .",
    "the technique for calculating time correlation functions is as follows .",
    "if the initial density matrix is a pure state , @xmath117 , then one begins with both states equal @xmath118 , and evolves them to time @xmath38 according to ( [ diad ] ) , which is equivalent to the qsd equation ( [ qsd_eqn ] ) . at time",
    "@xmath38 , multiply @xmath119 and continue to evolve the diad according to ( [ diad ] ) . at time @xmath39 , multiply @xmath120 and take the trace .",
    "the mean over many such trajectories equals the time - correlation function ( [ qrt_correlation ] ) .",
    "this pair of equations ( [ diad ] ) shares many properties in common with the qsd equation ( [ qsd_eqn ] ) , but unlike qsd is not uniquely defined . since only the composite diad @xmath121 is important , the norm and phase can be shifted arbitrarily between these two states .",
    "disi has likened this to a gauge freedom @xcite .",
    "many such pairs of equations are therefore possible , as well as others with properties radically different from qsd ; just as qsd is one of many unravelings of the master equation , albeit with unique symmetry properties . to solve for output spectra , of course",
    ", one must still fourier transform the calculated time correlation functions .    in fact",
    ", one can see that there are two distinct approaches to computing output spectra using qsd .",
    "one is to use the definition ( [ qsd_correlation3 ] ) or alternative definitions such as ( [ diad ] ) to calculate the time - correlation function , averaging over many runs , and taking the fourier transform ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can solve the qsd equation for the entire system plus output mode ; the state is then in the larger hilbert space @xmath23 .",
    "this is essentially the approach taken by schack et al .",
    "@xcite , who have also shown that these techniques can be used to calculate other quantities of interest , such as the spectrum of squeezing .",
    "both approaches appear to have their advantages and disadvantages , and to be roughly equal in computational difficulty .",
    "it is likely that the best approach will vary from problem to problem .",
    "note also that if we had unraveled the master equation ( [ master_eqn ] ) using an unraveling other than qsd , an exactly analogous argument would have followed .",
    "we would be able to resolve the equation for the system plus output mode into a pair of coupled equations , one corresponding to the unperturbed evolution of the system alone , the other to an output signal completely driven by the system .",
    "thus , this type of argument could be used to define a notion of time correlation functions for single trajectories in any unraveling , such as the quantum monte carlo techniques or the orthojumps of disi @xcite .",
    "these quantum monte carlo ( or quantum jump ) techniques deserve further comment , as there have already been a number of papers published on their use in the calculation of time correlation functions @xcite .",
    "these are relevant to our current discussion , since it can be shown that the equations for quantum jumps become identical to those for qsd in the case of heterodyne measurements @xcite .",
    "the treatment of gardiner , parkins , and zoller @xcite is particularly interesting in this context .",
    "their definition of the time correlation function involves defining an auxiliary vector @xmath122 which is driven by the evolution of the quantum jump vector @xmath123 , but does not in turn affect it .",
    "as stated in that paper @xcite their equations are rather different .",
    "in particular , they are considering only real noise , and have not gone to the weak coupling limit we have assumed in this paper , where the output has a negligibly weak effect on the system over short times . wiseman and milburn @xcite",
    "have generalized this treatment to consider the case of heterodyne measurements , introducing complex noise and showing that this limit is exactly equivalent to the quantum state diffusion equation . in the limit of heterodyne measurement with weak coupling to the external mode , the equation for @xmath123 becomes the qsd equation ( [ qsd_eqn ] ) , and the two vectors @xmath123 and @xmath122 obey a pair of coupled equations identical to ( [ system_eqn ] ) and ( [ output_eqn ] ) .",
    "the output spectrum is given by the mean of @xmath124 , just as in ( [ qsd_spectrum ] ) . from this",
    ", one could follow an argument exactly analogous to that of section 3 in this paper to arrive at a definition of a two - time correlation function identical to ( [ qsd_correlation3 ] ) .",
    "in calculating quantum optical spectra , a common approach is to calculate the quantum time correlation function and derive the spectrum by taking its fourier transform .",
    "this time correlation function has a form given by the quantum regression theorem , and requires a solution of the master equation .",
    "quantum state diffusion provides in many cases an efficient method of solving the master equation .",
    "but hitherto , an appropriate definition of the time correlation function for a single qsd trajectory has been lacking , making qsd less useful for the calculation of spectra .    in this paper",
    "we have derived such a definition in a straightforward way , quite analogous to the derivation in the case of the full master equation .",
    "this correlation function in the mean has the form given by the quantum regression theorem , and the equations for it are very close to the original qsd equation , up to @xmath125 in the interaction strength .",
    "this definition can be used as a practical numerical tool in computing quantum optical spectra .",
    "other possible definitions and their potential for practical use have been briefly discussed .",
    "finally , let us discuss the meaning of our result in the simple case of a damped harmonic oscillator at zero temperature .",
    "the stationary solution is the ground state .",
    "hence , once the system has reached this state , nothing happens , and it is clear that the spectrum of the damped oscillator is not contained in the evolution of its state vector .",
    "nevertheless , the quantum regression theorem tells us that all spectra , in particular the one corresponding to the position fluctuation , are contained in the evolution operator for the corresponding master equation .",
    "similarly , the results presented here tell us that the spectra are also contained in the stochastic evolution operator @xmath60 of the qsd description of the damped oscillator .",
    "the physics behind this is that whenever a spectrum is measured , the system s environment is changed , hence its dynamics is perturbed .",
    "for example , to measure the spectrum of position fluctuations , something like weak position measurements have to be applied , and the ground state is no longer stationary @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to standard quantum measurements , this perturbation can be made arbitrarily small ( corresponding to small amplitudes of the measured spectrum ) over an arbitrarily long period of time .",
    "to first order , the system s evolution is unaffected , but its states acts like a source for the signal , as reflected by our equations ( [ system_eqn ] ) and ( [ output_eqn ] ) .",
    "hence the unaffected evolution operator ( liouville operator or qsd propagator or other stochastic propagator @xcite ) contains the information about spectra that can not actually be measured without affecting ( i.e. , weakly perturbing ) the system s evolution .",
    "we would like to acknowledge many useful conversations with lajos disi , ian percival , marco rigo , rdiger schack , walter strunz and tim spiller .",
    "we would also like to thank our referee , who provided a great deal of important feedback and helped us to clarify our results .",
