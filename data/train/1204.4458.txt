    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is considered as one of the most appealing theories to describe physics at the tev scale .",
    "while this theory makes many interesting predictions the signals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) depend on unknowns such as the supersymmetric spectrum and the presence or absence of baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) number violating interactions ( collectively known as r - parity violating interactions ) .",
    "the cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite experiments have studied many possible signals of the mssm at the lhc setting very strong bounds on the gluino and squarks masses in some specific scenarios with missing energy . in the majority of the experimental studies",
    "it is assumed the absence of the baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) number violating interactions ( r - parity conservation ) .",
    "however , it is well - known that in general the b and l symmetries can be broken changing many of the predictions for the collider experiments .",
    "for example , one could modify all collider bounds based on the searches for missing energy if the baryon number is broken .    in this article",
    "we discuss the possible impact of the baryon number violating interactions on the supersymmetric signals at the lhc .",
    "we focus our study in the context of a simple extension of the mssm where the baryon and lepton numbers are local gauge symmetries spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",
    "we refer to this theory as the  blmssm \"  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this theory is that a large desert between the electroweak scale and grand unified scale is no longer necessary since , while b and l are broken at the low scale the proton remains stable . in the blmssm the lepton number is broken in an even number while the baryon number violating operators can change b by one unit .",
    "even though new generations of fermions are required , they do not mix with the sm fermions and therefore do not lead to flavour violation at tree level .",
    "furthermore , they are not associated with landau poles at the low scale .",
    "the light higgs boson mass can be large without assuming a large stop mass and left - right mixing and one could modify the current lhc bounds on the supersymmetric spectrum due to the presence of the baryon number violating interactions .",
    "we study in great detail the correlation between the higgs mass and the decay of the higgs boson into two photons following the new results presented by the atlas and cms collaborations . in this theory",
    "the new light leptons appreciably decrease the predictions for the higgs decay into two gammas . therefore , confirmation of the two photon signal at the lhc as the higgs decay rules out this model . in this theory",
    "the stops can be very light in agreement with the higgs mass and colliders bounds .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the main features of the blmssm .",
    "the possible impact of the baryon number violating interactions on the lhc searches are discussed in section iii .",
    "the predictions for the light cp - even higgs mass and the constraints on the supersymmetric spectrum are investigated in section iv . in section v the radiative higgs decays are studied , while the evolution of the gauge and yukawa couplings are investigated in section vi . in the appendices",
    "we include all details needed for the numerical calculations .",
    "in this article we study a simple supersymmetric model where the baryon number ( b ) and lepton number ( l ) are local gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the gauge symmetry @xmath0 we refer to this model as the  blmssm \" . in this context",
    "we have found that  @xcite    * the local b and l are spontaneously broken at the tev scale .",
    "* there are no dangerous operators mediating proton decay . *",
    "the lepton number is broken in an even number while the baryon number violating operators can change b by one unit .",
    "* anomaly cancellation requires the presence of new families , however there is no flavour violation at tree level since they do not mix with the sm fermions .",
    "* there are no landau poles at the low scale due to the new families .",
    "* the light higgs boson mass can be large without assuming a large stop mass and left - right mixing .",
    "* one could modify the current lhc bounds on the supersymmetric spectrum due to the presence of the baryon number violating interactions .",
    "in this model we have the chiral superfields of the mssm , and in order to cancel the b and l anomalies we need a vector - like family : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "see table i for the superfields present in the blmssm .",
    "the full superpotential of the model is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mssm superpotential and @xmath15 the new quark superfields acquire tev scale masses once the @xmath16 and @xmath17 higgs fields acquire a vev .",
    "consequently , the yukawa couplings of the new quarks to the higgs fields do not contribute greatly to the new quark masses and can be neglected .",
    "furthermore the yukawa couplings between the new quarks and the mssm higgses can be large and modify the higgs mass at one - loop level .",
    "notice that these couplings can have a large impact on the production cross section , @xmath18 , making it difficult to satisfy the experimental bounds on higgs production . in this work",
    ", we will take the conservative approach and assume these new quark yukawa couplings are small .",
    "the higgs mass is therefore only substantially modified by the yukawa couplings of the new leptons which must be large to insure the new leptons masses are large enough to satisfy collider bounds .    in the leptonic sector",
    "one has the following interactions @xmath19 notice that we have an implementation of the seesaw mechanism for the light neutrino masses once the @xmath20 field acquires a vev , while the new neutrinos have dirac mass terms . in order to avoid stability for the new quarks",
    "we add the fields , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which have the following interactions @xmath23 where the baryon number for the new fields are : @xmath24 , and if we assume that they do not get a vev the lightest one can be a dark matter candidate even if r - parity is violated .",

    "then , one can write the following dimension five operator which gives rise to baryon number violation once baryon number is broken through the vev of @xmath16 : @xmath29 therefore , after breaking @xmath30 we find the so - called @xmath31 mssm interactions which can modify the current lhc bounds on the supersymmetric mass spectrum . regardless of this r - parity breaking term",
    ", the field @xmath32 or their superpartners can be a dark matter candidate .",
    "the study of the properties of the dark matter candidates is beyond the scope of this article .      in this section",
    "we discuss how the local b and l symmetries are broken . in this context the local gauge group , @xmath33 , is broken to @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the sm gauge group and @xmath36 is the lepton parity : @xmath37 in this model the local baryonic symmetry @xmath30 is broken by the vev of the scalar fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "it is important to emphasize that the symmetry @xmath30 is broken at the tev scale and therefore the mass of the new neutral gauge boson is related to the susy breaking mass scale . in order to show this we give the dependence of the new gauge boson masses on the parameters in the model : @xmath47 once b is broken we can find new interactions which violate baryon number . using eq.(6 )",
    "one finds @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "these interactions break baryon number in one unit and are the so - called @xmath51 terms of the mssm .    as in the case of the baryon number the local @xmath52",

    "the discussion above one can find a similar relation between the quark - phobic gauge boson mass and the soft terms of the scalar fields : @xmath55 in the above equations @xmath56 and @xmath57 are soft masses for the higgses @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    now , after symmetry breaking one can see that the lepton number is only broken in two units . using the term , @xmath62 , in eq .",
    "( 4 ) one finds the majorana mass term for the right - handed neutrinos @xmath63 which is needed to generate neutrino masses though the seesaw mechanism .    summarizing , in this model the local b and l symmetries",
    "can be broken at the tev scale while contributions to proton decay are not induced because the baryon number is broken by one unit and the lepton number is broken by two units as required by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "there are relevant constraints coming from the @xmath64 processes , such as @xmath65 oscillations and di - nucleon decays , and from cosmology which we will discuss in the next sections .",
    "the mass for the new leptons are given by    @xmath66    using the above equations and imposing the perturbative condition for the yukawa coupling , @xmath67 , one finds an upper bound on @xmath68 : @xmath69 when @xmath70 gev .",
    ": in this model the sfermion masses are modified due to existence of new d - terms .",
    "for example , the stop mass matrix reads as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are squark soft masses .",
    "@xmath74 define the new contribution due to the presence of the @xmath30 d - term , @xmath75 is the top mass and @xmath76 is the left - right mixing in the stop sector . in a similar way we can write the mass matrix for the sbottoms .",
    "see the appendix for details .",
    "the new slepton mass are modified by the @xmath52 d - term . in the case of the mass matrix for the new sleptons of the fifth generation",
    "reads as @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the new d - term contribution and @xmath79 the left - right mixing in this sector .",
    "in order to simplify the discussion in the text we list the mass matrices for the other sfermions in the appendix .",
    "when the baryon asymmetry is generated above the electroweak scale strong bounds on the @xmath80 couplings exist from the condition that the @xmath81 and @xmath82 processes do not washout the baryon asymmetry generated .",
    "these constraints have been studied in great details in refs .",
    "the bound on these couplings read as  @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the squark mass .",
    "now , in order to understand the impact of this bound on the susy signals we will consider different scenarios for the lsp :    * neutralino as the lsp : + in this case the neutralino will decay into three quarks and one can have the following signals @xmath85 therefore , one could modify the bounds on the supersymmetric spectra since there is no missing energy in these channels .",
    "the neutralino decay length can naively be estimated as @xmath86 assuming the cosmological bounds .",
    "therefore , the lightest neutralino would decay outside the detector and one has the standard signals with missing energy at the lhc .",
    "however , if the baryogenesis mechanism is at the weak scale one can avoid the bounds from cosmology and the neutralino can decay inside the detector .",
    "* gluino as the lsp : + in this case the gluino pair production can lead to channels with same - sign tops and multijets @xmath87 now , assuming the constraint coming from cosmology one can estimate naively the decay length of the gluino as @xmath88 therefore , the gluino is long - lived and form bounded states . the resulting states that consist of either of a gluino pair or triplets of quarks , or of a gluino bound to a gluon , are called r - hadrons  @xcite .",
    "if the gluinos are produced near threshold , the formation of gluino - pair bound states ( gluinonium ) is also possible and leads to characteristic signals  @xcite and place strong bounds on the gluino mass . *",
    "slepton as the lsp : + if the lsp is a charged selectron one has a long - lived charged track since the decay length is very large due to the bound coming from cosmology and the four - body phase space suppression .",
    "this scenario is very similar to the long - lived stau scenario in gauge mediation  @xcite and one can have signals with two leptons , a same - sign top pair and four jets @xmath89 in the case when the sneutrino is the lsp one has missing energy and multijets @xmath90 this scenario is possible and will have constraints from the missing energy searches . * chargino as the lsp : + the case of a long - lived chargino is very similar to the previous scenario where one has a long - lived charged slepton .",
    "one has a charged tracks due to existence of a long - lived charged particle and we can have the following signals @xmath91 with same - sign top pair and multijets . * squark as the lsp : + due to the cosmological constraint the squarks will be long - lived and form bounded states .",
    "if we compute the decay length of a squark one finds @xmath92 therefore , the squark will form bounded states but it will decay inside the detector . in this case we can have displaced vertices as well when the stop ( sbottom ) has mass around 100 gev and we can have signals with four jets @xmath93 therefore , one can avoid the lhc constraints coming from the searches for multijets and missing energy .",
    "notice that this scenario is quite relevant for us because we will study different cases where the stop is quite light .",
    "it is important to mention that in the model discussed in this article the above constraints are relevant even if baryon number is broken at the tev scale .",
    "in general one can have an asymmetry in the sm sector and in the dark matter sector , where we have the @xmath94 field .",
    "now , we have discussed above that the @xmath95 interactions are generated at the tev scale , and if they are in thermal equilibrium before the electroweak phase transition , around 100 gev , one can not preserve the baryon asymmetry in the visible sector . therefore , in order to make sure that the asymmetry in the visible sector is not washed out we impose the above constraints .",
    "it is well - known , that if the baryon asymmetry is generated below the electroweak scale the bounds on @xmath96 listed above are not present .",
    "however , there are other bounds on these couplings .",
    "the most important coming from dinucleon decay , @xmath97  @xcite , and one gets @xmath98",
    "@xcite . if we use this bound and the one above from cosmology we can imposse a lower bound on the cutoff of the theory . using @xmath99 , @xmath100 tev and @xmath101",
    "one gets @xmath102 this is the naive lower bound on the cutoff of the theory . of course",
    ", the coupling @xmath103 can be smaller and the cutoff of the theory can be much lower . in the last section we will use the running of the yukawa couplings to set the possible cutoff assuming perturbativity at the high scale .",
    "recently , the atlas collaboration has published a new combined analysis  @xcite which excludes a sm higgs with mass in the ranges 112.9 gev-115.5 gev , 131 gev-238 gev , and 251 gev-466 gev . while the cms collaboration excludes a sm higgs with mass in the range 127.5 gev-600 gev  @xcite . also , it is well - known that both collaborations have observed an excess around 125 gev .    in this article",
    "we will consider a conservative scenario where the light cp - even higgs is sm - like with mass in the range 115 - 128 gev , and using this range we will show the possible constraints on the supersymmetric spectra in the mssm and in the blmssm . in this way we can compare both models and predictions for the radiative higgs decays showing the possibility of ruling out the blmmsm if the excess around 125 gev is confirmed in the new analysis by the atlas and cms collaborations .    in order to set our notation",
