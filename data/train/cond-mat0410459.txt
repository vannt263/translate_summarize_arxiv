    "<S> we introduce a two - dimensional growth model where every new site is located , at a distance @xmath0 from the barycenter of the pre - existing graph , according to the probability law @xmath1 , and is attached to ( only ) one pre - existing site with a probability @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is the number of links of the @xmath4 site of the pre - existing graph , and @xmath5 its distance to the new site ) . </S>",
    "<S> then we numerically determine that the probability distribution for a site to have @xmath6 links is asymptotically given , for all values of @xmath7 , by @xmath8 , where @xmath9^{1/(1-q)}$ ] is the function naturally emerging within nonextensive statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic index is numerically given ( at least for @xmath10 not too large ) by @xmath11 , and the characteristic number of links by @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 particular case belongs to the same universality class to which the barabasi - albert model belongs . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , we have numerically studied the rate at which the average number of links @xmath14 increases with the scaled time @xmath15 ; asymptotically , @xmath16 , the exponent being close to @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and zero otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the present results reinforce the conjecture that the microscopic dynamics of nonextensive systems typically build ( for instance , in gibbs @xmath19-space for hamiltonian systems ) a scale - free network .        </S>",
    "<S> among the subjects that are being studied intensively nowadays in statistical physics , there are two , namely _ nonextensive statistical mechanics _ ( see @xcite for a review ) and _ networks _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in particular _ scale - free _ </S>",
    "<S> networks @xcite , which receive special attention in connection with _ complex systems _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> could these two topics be intimately related ? </S>",
    "<S> this would not be so surprising after all , given the fact that both research lines frequently address similar types of natural and artificial systems , in physics , economics , chemistry , biology , linguistics , social sciences and others . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , such a connection has already been conjectured in several occasions , e.g. , @xcite ( preface and chapter 1 ) and @xcite . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a growth model , on which we exhibit and quantitatively explore this connection .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a continuous plane . </S>",
    "<S> we shall construct a single connected network of _ sites _ ( or _ nodes _ or _ vertices _ ) and _ links _ ( or _ bonds _ or _ edges _ ) by gradually ( sequentially ) making it grow . </S>",
    "<S> we first fix one site ( @xmath20 ) at some arbitrary origin of the plane . the second site ( @xmath21 ) </S>",
    "<S> is randomly and isotropically chosen at a distance @xmath0 distributed according to the probability law @xmath22 ; @xmath23 stands for _ growth _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> this second site is then linked to the first one . to locate the third site ( @xmath24 ) we move the origin to the barycenter of the two first sites , and apply again the distribution @xmath25 from this new origin . </S>",
    "<S> this third site is now going to be linked to only one of the pre - existing two sites . to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we use an attachement probability @xmath26 ; @xmath27 stands for _ attachment _ ) , where @xmath5 is the distance of the newly arrived site to the @xmath4 site of the pre - existing cluster , and the _ connectivity _ @xmath3 is the number of links already arriving to the same @xmath4 site ( at the present stage , @xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the growth - attachment process is sequentially repeated as long as we want ; the sites have unit radius , and no new site is admitted which overlaps with a previous one . if we denote with @xmath29 the total number of sites of the cluster , it immediately follows that the linking of the newly arrived site ( @xmath30 ) is done with the probability @xmath31     network for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the starting site at @xmath33 is indicated with a larger circle . </S>",
    "<S> notice the spontaneous emergence of hubs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1],width=230,height=226 ]    it is clear that the dynamics of this model makes the arriving sites to have preferential attachment to the previous sites that already have many links ( _ hubs _ ) , _ as long as they are not too far_. this competition ( already explored in @xcite for the particular case of _ uniform _ distribution of sites within some limited region ) between connectivity and ( euclidean ) proximity is less pronounced when @xmath10 is close to zero , and completely disappears only at @xmath13 . for this particular case , </S>",
    "<S> one expects behaviors consistent with the barabasi - albert model @xcite , which has topology but no metrics . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on two main aspects : ( i ) the stationary - state connectivity distribution @xmath34 associated with the number of sites that have @xmath6 links in the @xmath35 limit ; ( ii ) the time dependence of the average number @xmath14 of links , more precisely how @xmath14 grows with the scaled time @xmath15 ( @xmath36 ) , particularly in the limit @xmath37 ( see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> typical networks obtained with this model are indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results for @xmath34 are indicated in figs . 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 the fact that @xmath34 does not depend from @xmath7 for any given value of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath7 controls the metrics of the emerging cluster , but has no influence on the connectivity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , this distribution is greatly influenced by the exponent @xmath10 , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . we can verify that all our examples are very well fitted with the form @xmath38 where the _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39-exponential _ function is defined as follows @xcite @xmath40^{1/(1-q ) } \\;\\;\\;(e_1^x = e^x ) \\ ; ; \\ ] ] @xmath41 is a characteristic number of links . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the @xmath10 dependences of @xmath39 and @xmath42 . in particular , @xmath43 does not exhibit a critical value of @xmath10 above which a different regime could emerge . </S>",
    "<S> however , unless a detailed analysis ( out of the aim of the present letter ) is done of the finite - size effects , such a possibility should not be excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> c +   +    c +    c +    we must now address a relevant point : why have we fitted our curves with @xmath39-exponentials ? </S>",
    "<S> the reason lies on the conjectured connection with nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) , a theory which we briefly illustrate now . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the following generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath44 : @xmath45^q}{q-1 } \\;\\;\\;\\;(q \\in { \\cal r};\\,s_1=s_{bg})\\ ] ] if we optimize this entropy with the constraints @xmath46 and @xmath47^q\\ } / \\ {    \\int dk \\,[p(k)]^q\\ } = k$ ] we obtain straightforwardly @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is simply related with a lagrange parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this expression precisely coincides with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) through the identification @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51    before proceeding with our numerical results , let us briefly mention what indications make us to believe that a close connection , and not just a mere functional coincidence , might exist between the present preferential - attachement growth model and the thermostatistical systems addressed by the entropy ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , a growth model involving , like the present one , preferential attachment has been proposed and both analytically and numerically discussed in @xcite . in this model the connectivity distribution is analytically shown to be precisely of the form ( 2 ) ( although written in a slightly different manner ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding entropic index is given @xcite ( chapter 1 ) by @xmath52/[m(3 - 2r)+1-p - r]$ ] , where @xmath53 are parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> second , lennard - jones small clusters ( with up to 14 atoms ) have been numerically studied recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of the number of local minima of the potential energy with @xmath6 neighboring saddle - points in the configurational phase space can , although not mentioned in the original paper @xcite , be quite well fitted with @xmath39-exponentials with @xmath54 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , the present model generates structures that are scale - free ( see , for instance , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consistently , there is plethoric evidence of the connections of the nonextensive entropy @xmath55 , and of its associated statistics , with hierarchical and ( multi)fractal structures ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that none of these three features constitutes a proof ; however , the set of them suggests the quite plausible scenario that the present growth model basically satisfies the dynamical requirements for the nonextensive concepts to be applicable .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now present our results concerning the rate at which the number of links of a given site increases with time . </S>",
    "<S> a basic quantity is the average ( over 2000 realizations ) number @xmath56 of links at a given time , more precisely as a function of the _ scaled time _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically find that , for all values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a growth model which has both preferential attachment and metrics . </S>",
    "<S> every new site of the cluster has to  decide \" to which one of the pre - existing sites will link itself . in this stochastic choice , there might be competition between the  popular \" sites ( those that already have many links ) and the nearby sites . </S>",
    "<S> this competition is more pronounced for increasing value of the exponent @xmath10 ; it disppears for @xmath13 . the connectivity distribution and the rate of increase of links with time are substantially influenced by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 model belongs to the same universality class to which the well known barabasi - albert model belongs . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these results , we have shown that the connectivity distribution is ( numerically ) given by the @xmath39-exponential function that emerges naturally in the frame of nonextensive statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this fact supports the conjecture @xcite that the typical occupation of the accessible phase space of many nonextensive dynamical systems might be , in relevant stationary states , scale - free . </S>",
    "<S> this is in notorious variance with the occupation of standard , extensive , isolated dynamical systems , which tends to be uniform , and whose equilibrium state is that prescribed within boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics . </S>"
