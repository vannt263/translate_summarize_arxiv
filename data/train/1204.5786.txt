    "since the earliest days of obtaining quasar spectra , it has been known that systems of intervening absorption lines appear in the spectra of quasars ( @xmath13 ) ( sandage 1965 , burbidge et al .",
    "1966 , schmidt 1966 , stockton & lynds 1966 , arp et al . 1967 ) .",
    "absorption line systems seen in quasar spectra ( qsoals ) with apparent velocities with respect to the quasar of @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 v / c ) are most often interpreted as arising in intervening galaxies ( bahcall et al .",
    "1966 , bahcall 1968 , bahcall & spitzer 1969 , sargent et al . 1989 , steidel et al . 1995 ) . in some cases",
    ", these absorbers may arise in ejected material associated with the background quasar , but appearing at velocities up to 30,000 km s@xmath6 ( hamman et al .",
    "1997 , richards et al . 1999 ,",
    "misawa et al . 2007 )",
    ". however , we are not presently concerned with systems associated with the quasar .    of chief concern here are those systems with @xmath14 .",
    "the issue is important for several reasons : 1 ) absorption line systems arising in quasar spectra provide a straightforward and precise method of probing abundances in galaxies in the range @xmath16 , and hence the general evolution of the elements ( pettini et al . 1997 , kulkarni et al . 2007 , prochaska et al .",
    "2006 ) , 2 ) the distribution and history of gas in galaxies , which may extend to distances up to @xmath17 mpc ( steidel et al . 1995 ) , can be probed ( heckman et al .",

    "3 ) the gas distribution in galaxies may be related to the origin of analogous 21 cm , high velocity cloud systems of the milky way ( wakker et al .",
    "2007 , wakker & van woerden 1997 ) which systems presumably exist in other galaxies ( appleton et al . 1981 , york 1982 , pisano et al .",
    "2007 , osterloo et al .",
    "4 ) studies of a large sample of low- and high - z absorbers associated with galaxies may provide information on the amount of gas and dust in galaxies of different ages and morphologies .",
    "5 ) comparison of the properties of those absorbers with known galaxies to absorbers for which no galaxies are seen may reveal a way to separate high velocity ejecta originating in the background quasar from absorption in foreground , but invisible , galaxies .",
    "until recently , the galaxies associated with high @xmath9 systems have been hard to detect via imaging , and the origin of many absorbers could not be confirmed ( e.g. cohen et al .",

    "2010 , proux et al .",
    "2011a , b , proux et al . 2012 ) , with a further @xmath19 unconfirmed but still possible candidates ( straka et al . 2010 , 2011 ; rao et al . 2011 ; meiring et al . 2011 ; proux et al . 2011a , b ) .",
    "recent progress at higher redshifts ( z@xmath202 ) reveals several confirmed detections ( moller et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; bouche et al . 2012 ; noterdaeme et al . 2012 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "this is a sample too small to establish a complete , unique set of properties of absorption systems from galaxies and their halos ( womble et al .",
    "we have here begun to expand the sample with a preliminary pool of 23 fields , 10 of which are unique . in our subsequent papers",
    ", we will be adding a further @xmath21 unique fields to the overall sample , allowing us to make a more complete analysis .    in order to recognize foreground galaxies associated with qsoals",
    ", we must first establish their properties .",
    "one way to establish these properties is to carry out absorption studies in a very large number of low - z galaxies ( @xmath22 ) , for which certain galaxy properties are easy to determine ( mass , stellar population age , and morphology , for example ) . given that we have an excellent statistical characterization of qsoals at high - z ( sargent et al .",

    "2003 , york et al .",

    "2007 , vanden berk et al . 2008 ) , we need a significant data set of absorption line systems in known low - z galaxies . the addition of a low - z sample will form a more complete evolutionary picture over a range of redshifts when combined with high - z samples . though the sample of low - z absorbers will in all likelihood not translate directly to the high - z sample due to this evolution of properties , we may be able to discern , using analogous properties , those qsoals at high - z that arise in foreground galaxies .",
    "we can extend the argument in order to understand in which subparts of galaxies those absorption features arise ( disks , systems of 21 cm high velocity clouds , tidal streams , etc . ) , and also to understand key physical properties such as the sources of ionization ( c iv , o vi ) within galaxies ( bowen et al .",
    ". it would likewise be important to learn to distinguish ejected systems , spectroscopically , from intervening systems ( hamman et al .",
    "1997 , hall et al .",
    "2002 , reichart et al .",
    "2004 , trump et al .",
    "2006 ) for further study of those entities , but that is beyond the scope of this paper .    one way to work around the fact that many searches for absorbers have found no counterpart galaxy is to observe visible or spectroscopically detected galaxies on top of qso images .",
    "a number of ways exist to find quasar - galaxy pairs ( qgp ) .",
    "pairs of quasars and galaxies have been most often found by matching catalogs of quasars and galaxies ( hewitt & burbidge 1989 , womble et al .",
    "1993 , bowen et al . 2006 ) or by first finding absorption lines in quasar spectra and following up with deep imaging to find nearby galaxies with matching redshifts ( bergeron & boisse 1991 , yanny & york 1992 , le brun et al .",
    "1996 , zych et al .",
    "further ways of detectioning qgp include locating background quasars which are gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies ( with multiple images of the background quasar separated by a few arcseconds or less ) , searching for binary quasars producing projected qgp ( false positives for binary quasars ) , with the background quasar probing the host galaxy of the foreground quasar ( e.g. hennawi et al .",
    "2006 ; hennawi & prochaska 2007 ; bowen et al . 2006 ; myers et al .",
    "2008 ) , or examining discrepant redshifts from the same objects using different reduction codes ( the discrepancies come from different ways of handling unidentified emission lines , for instance ) .",
    "this paper uses a new technique by searching for narrow emission lines in quasar spectra that do not match the redshift of the broad , prominent quasar emisson lines ( quashnock et al .",
    "2008 , noterdaeme et al .",
    "2010 , borthakur et al . 2010 , this study ) , then doing imaging and follow - up studies of the implied emission line galaxies .    after this work began , noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2010 ) performed a search for [ o iii ] @xmath235007 emission from foreground galaxies in spectra of qsos .",
    "they published 46 such objects .",
    "we are undertaking to derive the properties of the qsos and the galaxies in these types of pairs also , this paper being the first of four planned .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the use of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for finding emission objects in spectra of qsos is discussed . in section 3 , the results of our search of sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) are described .",
    "the particular properties of 23 galaxies that lie directly on sightlines to quasars are elaborated . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize our results and give our conclusions .",
    "in some cases , a quasar may lie directly behind a foreground galaxy .",
    "if some part of the galaxy is within @xmath24 of the quasar , some fraction of the light from the galaxy falls into the @xmath25-diameter fibers of the sdss spectrograph .",
    "poorer seeing conditions could also cause light from a galaxy located at more than @xmath24 from the qso to fall within the fiber .",
    "the first such case , sdssj104257.5 + 074850.5 ( @xmath26 , m@xmath27 ) , showing a strong radio source with a prominent foreground galaxy overlapping , was found while inspecting a large number of quasar spectra from the quasar absorption catalog of york et al .",

    "henceforth , quasars are referred to with the notation q followed by the truncated four digit ra and declination , e.g. , q1042 + 0748 ( epoch 2000 ) .",
    "the clear detection of narrow emission at @xmath28 is seen in [ o ii ] @xmath29 , h@xmath9 ( 4862.7 ) , [ o iii ] @xmath30 , h@xmath2 ( 6564.6 ) , and [ s  ii ] @xmath31 .",
    "the lines of [ n ii ] @xmath32 are notably weak or missing .",
    "we use vacuum wavelengths , with close pairs at appropriate wavelength listed by vanden berk et al .",
    "an exhaustive study of the foreground galaxy was undertaken by borthakur et al .",
    "figures 2 and 3 of borthakur et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show high resolution images of q1042 + 0748 .",
    "the redshift of q1042 + 0748 is too high to expect the signature of the qso host galaxy to show up in imaging .",
    "therefore , the detected extended emission must be from a lower redshift intervening galaxy , most likely the galaxy corresponding to the z=0.033 emission lines .",
    "an effort was made to find other such images in the dr4 quasar catalog using an sql search .",
    "the search asks for all objects that were targeted for spectroscopy as galaxies , based on the extended shape , but classified as quasars , based on the resulting spectrum .",
    "twelve objects were found , including the prototype object q1042 + 0748 .",
    "no other galaxy foreground to a quasar image was found .",
    "a more sophisticated algorithm may , in the future , produce additional candidates , but we decided to try a different method .",
    "any emission lines in the galaxy spectra show up in the quasar spectra as unidentified lines at a redshift different from the dominant quasar emission line redshift .",
    "the unidentified lines are saved in the sdss reduction files as significant emission lines with no identification .",
    "our use of these data is described below .",
    "( in principle , the absorption spectra of an overlapping , foreground galaxy could also be isolated from the qso spectrum ( vanden berk et al .",
    "we therefore used a spectroscopic method of locating qgp , searching among these unidentified lines in the original dr5 spectroscopic reduction files .",
    "this method has the benefit of returning even small galaxies at small impact parameters , which could possibly be lost within the psf of the qso .",
    "the spectroscopic pipeline used to reduce quasar spectra uses an automated method to identify and classify the quasars , galaxies , and stars that were targeted for spectroscopy ( richards et al .",
    "2002 , strauss et al .",
    "2002 , beers et al . 2006 ) . in the process of reducing spectra of targeted quasars ,",
    "emission lines were found in some spectra with widths @xmath33 km s@xmath6 . these formed consistent patterns in redshift that revealed the objects as quasars . unidentified narrower lines",
    "were separately saved and can be searched for with an sql search .",
    "the sql search requirements consisted of strong h@xmath2 emission between 6565  and 9100(corresponding to a redshift range of @xmath34 ) , fwhm of @xmath35 pixels ( @xmath36 km s@xmath6 ) , and a flux greater than @xmath4 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "the flux value was picked as a conservative value that would produce the clearest systems .",
    "the unidentified line strengths determined in the spectroscopic pipeline were used for the search .",
    "about 4000 indications were found ( mostly false positives ) .",
    "the true detections were picked out by hand by confirming other emission lines present at the same redshift as the candidate h@xmath2 line or by rejecting the supposed detection as a spectroscopic artifact .",

    "2010 ) reveals a significance of 0.003% corresponding to a maximum absolute discrepancy of 0.489 in r - band magnitude ( using dr7 magnitudes for our sample ) .",
    "we have also run the ks test regarding qso redshift between these two samples and found a significance of 39.84% corresponding to a max absolute discrepancy of 0.19 .",
    "this implies that our sample is significantly different than the overall qso population found in the sdss when looked at from the r - band . in subsequent papers our sample",
    "will be increased by a factor of three , making our sample of qso magnitudes more robust .",
    "noterdaeme et al . (",
    "2010 ) discuss the effect of qso luminosity on detecting overlapping galactic emission lines .",
    "as one would expect , detections towards fainter qsos are easier because lower signal - to - noise ( s /",
    "n ) ratio is necessary .",
    "however , s / n in sdss spectra increases rapidly with qso brightness , which allows for detections towards brighter qsos .",
    "very bright qsos ( m@xmath3717 ) are only a very small contribution to the statistics ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "our measured reddening values support these results .",
    "fainter qsos tend to show smaller amounts of reddening , while the brighter qsos found in our sample tend to show much more reddening , thus allowing them to be detected in our sample .",
    "we observe a slight difference in the redshift distribution that may be due to the effects of galactic emission lines being more difficult to detect on top of qso emission lines .",
    "however , this difference has low significance ( @xmath3860% ) .",
    "further effects biasing our sample include sky - line residuals and other strong emission line sources making it difficult to detect the galactic emission lines we seek .    of these 4000 , 23 were found to be positive detections .",
    "false positives in this sample were primarily due to sky - line residuals , where a sky - line was mistakenly taken as h@xmath2 .",

    "the galaxies found in each image are fitted with different models .",
    "the flux from a point source object , such as a star or a quasar , is best fit with point spread function model , however the flux from a galaxy is best fit with a matched galaxy model .",
    "the sdss uses two models to fit galaxy flux profiles : a pure exponential and a devaucoulers profile . for each object",

    ", the petrosian radius and the model magnitude can indicate if the profile of the quasar deviates from that of a point source .",

    "similarly , e(b - v)@xmath10 and color are only very weakly correlated with r@xmath65=0.25 .      for galaxies that have h@xmath2 and [ o ii ] lines we can estimate the sfr of the galaxy using the relation from kennicutt ( 1998 ) :    @xmath66    @xmath67)(ergs ~s^{-1})\\ ] ]    where l(h@xmath2 )",

    "note that all reported sfr are lower limits , as a large fraction of light from the galaxy falls outside the sdss spectral fiber .",
    "knowing the impact parameter and extent of the galaxy , we can correct for this fiber loss by estimating the fraction of the galaxy within 1.5of the qso and using it as a correction factor for the flux measured within the fiber .",
    "however , we do not expect the emission in any particular line to be uniform across the entire galaxy , so the best way to determine the total flux is follow up spectroscopy targeting the galaxies themselves .",
    "we find a range of corrections , going from no correction at all ( entire visible galaxy falls within 1.5 ; e.g. q0239 - 0705 and q0940 + 3415 ) to 0.81 ( 81% of galaxy falls outside 1.5 ; e.g. q1501 + 5710 ) .",
    "we find that the sfr for all systems are very low , ranging from 0.003 to 1.44 uncorrected for extinction in h@xmath2 .",

    "the ratio of h@xmath2 and h@xmath9 emission line fluxes is also a good measure of the presence of extinction for the part of the galaxy falling within the sdss spectral fiber .",
    "it should be noted that the paths illuminated by the internal emission lines and by the qso differ , so the actual extinction values need not be identical .",
    "given the value of about 2.88 for h ii region gas ( osterbrock 1989 ) , any value of h@xmath2/h@xmath9 other than this would be an indication of extinction with case - b recombination .",

    "we have little reason to expect the two quantities to be correlated , however , as they potentially sample different sight lines through the galaxy .",

    "it is possible the lower amount of dust along the line of sight to the qso is related to impact parameter .",

    "we can clearly see that all of our bins fall well within the range of late - type galaxies .",
    "the median value for the black histogram is ( u - r)=1.43 .",
    "the red histogram shows the ( u - r ) distribution from the sdss magnitudes for the same 14 galaxies prior to deblending the galaxy and the quasar .",
    "we can see that prior to the deblending , the galaxies are systematically much bluer , with a median value of ( u - r)=0.93 .",
    "most of these values fall blueward of even the late - type range in the strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) plot .",
    "this is due to the fact that the light from the qso skews the magnitude values towards the bluer filters , causing them to be much brighter than if the galaxy were measured alone .",
    "this result is nt so surprising , as we expect galaxies selected via emission lines will naturally tend towards late - types .",
    "the e(b - v)@xmath10 values found in our study indicate that many of the found objects are significantly reddened with an average e(b@xmath50v)@xmath10 value of 0.101 .",
    "thus , the average extinction in the observer frame and the absorber rest frame is significantly greater than the average extinction of non - absorber quasars as well as qsoalss as measured in york et al .",
    "figure  [ fig - extinction ] below shows an analogous graph to figure 5 from york et al . for our data . a kolmogorov - smirnov test between the sample in this study and the much larger sample found in york et al .",

    "the results indicate that our sample is significantly different than the sample in york et al .",
    ", with our absorbers being more reddened .",
    "again , figure  [ fig - color ] indicates that our absorber galaxies are primarily late - type , which are known to contain large amounts of dust compared to early - type galaxies , thus causing increased reddening in the background quasars .",
    "comparisons can also be made with systems with diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , ca ii systems , and galaxies known to contain dlas .",

    "they report one detection with e(b - v)@xmath79 , which is higher than typical values for ca ii selected systems and is generally higher than most of our sample but is comparable to our five most reddened systems .",
    "wild et al . ( 2006 ) provide a sample of 37 ca ii absorbers and compare the degree of reddening in background qsos .",
    "they find e(b - v ) values in the range -0.008 to 0.417 , with five out of six systems in their dr4 sample having e(b - v)@xmath80 .",
    "this is consistent with the values we have found . of our most reddened objects , four of five have ca ii absorption . regarding dlas , khare et al",
    "( 2012 ) report that only 10% or less of dlas in sdss dr7 cause significant reddening in background qsos .",
    "however , higher dust content in dlas is found in those not selected on the basis of color . as such , dusty qsos",
    "may be missed due to this color selection bias .",
    "three of the pairs in our sample are photometrically separated in sdss : qj0943 - 0043 ( object 2 ) , qj1605 + 5107 ( object 7 ) , and qj1401 + 4141 ( object 20 ) .",
    "that is , sdss recognizes the galaxy and the quasar as two separate objects , and performs photometric calculations for them separately .",
    "table  [ tbl - deblended ] shows the calculated values for our study and sdss side - by - side for comparison .",
    "we find the ( u - r ) values to match within ( u - r ) of 0.02 for all three objects .",

    "these objects have h@xmath2 sfr corresponding to 0.40 m@xmath69 yr@xmath6 and 0.35 m@xmath69 yr@xmath6 respectively .",
    "object 10 has a velocity spread of at least 300 km / s according to the equivalent width of mg ii .",
    "object 19 could be a good candidate for a bunch of disk clouds with ca ii depletion .",
    "the relationships of w(ca ii ) and w(na i ) absorption to impact parameter and extinction are given in figures  [ fig - cana_b ] and  [ fig - cana_ebv ] .",
    "we find no significant correlation between w(ca ii ) and b or w(na i ) and b for @xmath12 .",
    "however , w(ca ii ) and e(b - v)@xmath10 are moderately anticorrelated with r@xmath65=-0.77 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is perhaps due to the depleted nature of ca ii , whereby dustier systems have narrower w(ca ii ) because ca ii condenses out of the gas phase more readily .",
    "w(na i ) and e(b - v)@xmath10 are not significantly correlated with r@xmath65=0.14 . again , these samples are small , with only 8 and 9 data points for the figures respectively , decreasing our chances of finding a significant correlation .",
    "we have measured the properties of the quasars and foreground galaxies in 23 fields containing quasar - galaxy pairs from the sdss . these galaxies in front of quasars",
    "were detected via their narrow emission lines in the more dominant quasar spectra .",
    "the search detected h@xmath2 emission , and the results were in turn inspected by eye for further emission lines and any visible galaxy counterpart in the sdss imaging . by performing psf subtraction to remove the quasar from the image , we were able to make measurements on the galaxy without light contamination from the very nearby quasar . from this , we were able to determine apparent and absolute magnitudes and reddening and extinction estimates . utilizing the emission lines found in the spectra , we were also able to determine sfr and reddening estimates .",
    "we find no trends relating e(b - v)@xmath10 , _ b _ , and ( u - r ) for the galaxies .",
    "similarly , we find no trend relating ca ii or na i absorption strength to _ b _ or e(b - v)@xmath10 , nor between ca ii and na i , given the few data points currently in our sample .",
    "we note that high resolution ground based observations of ca ii , ch , ch+ , ca i , na i , and k i can be used to explore the properties of the gas in a larger array of galaxies than has been done heretofore . as radio telescopes improve in sensitivity , 21 cm absorption can be a measure of the generally weak radio sources that will be typical of this sample ( gupta et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the diffuse interstellar bands can be observed and correlated with other gas properties .",
    "ultraviolet observations can yield detailed extinction curves and abundances of the elements for comparison with high redshift qso absorbers .",
    "our sample size is still very small , but we have already begun the process of enlarging it by a factor of more than 4 .",
    "similar searches of sdss have returned a further @xmath38100 pairs , which will be published in subsequent papers in this series . in this work",
    "we have begun comparing our small sample to color and extinction studies done by strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and york et al .",

    "( 2001 ) , with our sample being more reddened than the sample of york et al .",
    "the sample discussed in this work is yet too small to make any assumptions about the reddening ranges , however , the beginning color trend and results of the kolmogorov - smirnov test indicate they could be dusty , characteristic of disk - dominated galaxies .",
