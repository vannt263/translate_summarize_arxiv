    "since the discovery of superconductivity in alkali - metal doped @xmath8 , extensive research on @xmath8 and other fullerenes has been carried out worldwide , aiming at understanding the mechanism for superconductivity and other related issues in fullerenes.@xcite most of the theoretical models assumed that electron - phonon interaction is important for superconductivity.@xcite based on the analysis of the linewidths in vibronic spectra excited either by light ( raman scattering ) or by neutrons , the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 for @xmath10 ( a = alkali metal ) has been estimated .",
    "recently , winter and kuzmany observed that the low frequency @xmath11 and @xmath12 modes lose all degeneracy and split into five components , each of which couples differently to the @xmath13 electrons for single crystal of @xmath6 at 80 k.@xcite these results revealed that in the superconducting state , the pairing is mediated by phonons with weak or intermediate coupling .",
    "@xcite the lowest two unoccupied molecular orbitals of @xmath8 are both triply degenerated , having @xmath13 and @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "filling of @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands with electrons is achieved by intercalation of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals to @xmath8 solids , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , understanding of the `` @xmath14 superconductors '' is extremely poor in comparison with the well known @xmath13 superconductors .",
    "comparison of physical property in between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 superconductors is of particular interest from the view point of mechanism of superconductivity . from the @xmath13 symmetry of the electrons in the conduction band",
    "a coupling is only possible to the total symmetric @xmath15 modes and to the five - fold degenerate @xmath1 modes .",
    "while the coupling to the @xmath15 mode is expected to be weak due to an efficient screening effect , the @xmath1 modes may have a significantly strong coupling constant since they allow a jahn - teller mechanism .",
    "a similar coupling should take place in the case of the electrons with @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "superconductivity of ba - doped @xmath8 was first discovered by kortan et al , @xcite who claimed that the superconducting phase is bcc @xmath3 .",
    "recently , baenitz et al.,@xcite on the other hand , reported that the superconducting phase is not @xmath3 but @xmath2 .",
    "very recently , we succeeded to synthesize single phase @xmath2 , and unambiguously confirmed that the @xmath2 is the superconducting phase . in this work ,",
    "we present results of a raman scattering study of single phase @xmath0 ( x=3 , 4 and 6 ) with @xmath14 states .",
    "the results indicate that the electron - phonon interaction is also important for the @xmath14 superconductor , particularly in superconducting @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , some amazing results were observed , particularly for the low frequency @xmath1 modes .",
    "( 1 ) raman shift of the tangential @xmath15 mode for @xmath3 is much larger than the simple extrapolation relationship between raman shift and charge transfer in alkali metal doped @xmath8 ; while the radial @xmath15 mode nearly remains unchanged with increasing charge transfer .",
    "( 2 ) the raman scattering behavior is quite different among the three phases of @xmath16 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , especially for the low frequency @xmath1 modes .",
    "the low frequency @xmath1 modes lose all degeneracy and split into five ( or four ) peaks at room temperature for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 samples , each of which couples differently to electrons with @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "the splitting of low frequency @xmath1 modes into five components even at room temperature is similar to that observed in single crystal of @xmath6 at low temperature of 80 k. @xcite this is significant to understand the splitting and to evaluate the electron - phonon coupling constants for all directly coupling mode , estimating tc in ba - doped @xmath8 .",
    "samples of @xmath0 ( x=3 , 4 and 6 ) were synthesized by reacting stoichiometric amount of powers of ba and @xmath8 .",
    "a quartz tube with mixed powder inside was sealed under high vacuum of about @xmath17 torr .",
    "the samples of @xmath16 and @xmath3 were calcined at 600 @xmath18 for 216 hours with intermediate grindings of two times . in order to obtain high quality @xmath2 sample ,",
    "thermal annealing was carried out at 600 @xmath18 for 1080 hours with five intermediate grindings .",
    "x - ray diffraction showed that all samples were single phase , which is also confirmed by the single peak feature of the pentagonal pinch @xmath7 mode in the raman spectra .",
    "raman scattering experiments were carried out using the 632.8 nm line of a he - ne laser in the brewster angle backscattering geometry .",
    "the scattering light was detected with a dilor xy multichannel spectrometer using a spectral resolution of 3 @xmath19 .",
    "decomposition of the spectra into individual lines was made with a peak - fitting routine after a careful subtraction of the background originating from the laser . in order to obtain good raman spectra ,",
    "the samples were ground and pressed into pellets with pressure of about 20 @xmath20 , which were sealed in pyrex tubes under a high vacuum of @xmath21 torr .",
    "figure 1 shows room temperature raman spectra for the polycrystalline samples of @xmath16 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . for the three samples , only one peak of the pentagonal pinch @xmath7 mode",
    "is observed , providing an evidence that each sample is in a single phase .",
    "these agree fairly well with the x - ray diffraction patterns .",
    "interestingly , the three spectra have different strongest lines ; they are @xmath12 , @xmath22 , and @xmath7 modes for @xmath16 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "another thing to be noted is that the half - width of all corresponding peaks of @xmath2 is largest among @xmath0 ( x=3 , 4 and 6 ) samples except for the @xmath22 mode .",
    "this result is indicative of an importance of electron - phonon coupling in raman spectrum of @xmath2 .",
    "detailed discussion is given in the following . also , it is to be pointed out that the raman spectrum of @xmath16 sample is amazingly similar to that of @xmath23,@xcite suggesting that the electronic states of @xmath16 is similar to that of @xmath23 .",
    "this is in a fair agreement with a simple expectation that @xmath8 in both compounds is hexavalent .",
    "the frequency of the pentagonal pinch mode @xmath24 decreases with increasing ba concentration , similarly to the case of alkali - metal doped @xmath8.@xcite the raman shift of the @xmath7 mode is discussed in the following . by contrast , the frequency of the radial @xmath22 mode remains almost unchanged with ba concentration , being different from the case of @xmath25 , where a slight up - shift of the radial @xmath22 mode was observed.@xcite the low frequency @xmath1 modes show dramatic changes depending on the ba concentration .",
    "in particular , clear splittings are observed for the lowest frequency @xmath1 modes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the positions ( @xmath26 ) and halfwidths ( @xmath27 ) of the raman modes observed are listed in table i. for comparison , the lines for pure @xmath8 are included in table i. in the following , we show detailed analysis of @xmath1 modes first , and then , discuss on the @xmath15 modes .    in fig.2",
    "we show the results of a line - shape analysis of the raman spectra of the @xmath11 modes for @xmath16 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 samples .",
    "all modes were fit to a lorentzian line shape . for @xmath16 and @xmath3 , a doublet with lorentzian components",
    "is observed , which has been observed in @xmath23.@xcite however , the @xmath11 mode has to be fit with four components for @xmath2 . this splitting may be attributed to the symmetry lowering due to the orthorhombic structure of this material .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed in single crystal @xmath6 at 80 k,@xcite in which the @xmath11 mode is split into five components .",
    "position of the @xmath11 components for @xmath2 sample is nearly the same as that observed in @xmath6 .",
    "figure 3 shows the higher resolution raman spectra in the vicinity of 400 @xmath19 for @xmath16 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . while the cubic @xmath16 shows a single peak at 432 @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath12 mode is apparently split into five components in @xmath3 .",
    "this splitting of @xmath12 mode in @xmath28 is unexpected since the group theoretical consideration predicts a splitting into two in the space group @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath12 mode might suggest a symmetry lowering which is not detected in the x - ray diffraction .",
    "this type of disagreement between microscopic spectroscopy and structural analysis was observed in @xmath31 , and still remains an open question .",
    "@xcite a characteristic feature of the @xmath12 mode of @xmath3 is that the widths @xmath27 of the components are almost the same except for the 428 @xmath19 component .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath12 mode of @xmath2 shows a strong peak at the high frequency edge associated with a long tailing structure towards lower frequencies .",
    "linewidth and lineshift for the components are clearly related .",
    "a theoretical calculation shows the electron - phonon coupling constants are very sensitive to the change in the normal coordinates , the different components of the mode correspond to the different coupling constants.@xcite it suggests that the fivefold degeneracy of the mode is lifted and each component couples with a different strength to the @xmath14 carriers in @xmath2",
    ".    results of a line - shape analysis of the raman spectra of the @xmath32 modes are shown in fig.4 .",
    "a doublet of @xmath32 is observed for @xmath16 , which is ascribed to symmetry - lowering relative to @xmath8 molecules .",
    "@xcite the @xmath32 mode also displays a splitting into four both in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath32 mode in @xmath3 also contradicts with the group theoretical consideration .",
    "it is to be pointed out that this anomalous splitting of @xmath3 @xmath1 modes is observed only in @xmath12 and @xmath32 modes .",
    "the other @xmath1 modes are singlet or doublet , being consistent with the group theoretical consideration .    in reference 9 ,",
    "winter and kuzmany gave several possible explanations for the splitting of the low frequency @xmath1 modes .",
    "( 1 ) the splitting of the modes is understood from the merohedral disorder for the alkali derived metallic fullerides.@xcite this disorder is of low enough symmetry to allow only one dimensional representations for all modes .",
    "( 2 ) the splitting originates from a jahn - teller type interaction .",
    "this interaction can give rise to a new vibrational system with rather large number of components , even more than five.@xcite also , a contribution to the splitting from an internal strain between the doped part of the crystal and the undoped part of the crystal .",
    "in our experiments , the low frequency @xmath1 modes almost lose all degeneracy for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and is different from that of @xmath16 which is similar to that of @xmath23 at room temperature . in the case of @xmath2 ,",
    "the splitting can be understood since the crystal structure is orthorhombic .",
    "however , the splitting of @xmath3 is not explained from the crystal structure .",
    "particularly , when one considers that @xmath3 is isostructural to @xmath23 , the splitting of @xmath12 and @xmath32 modes are considerably anomalous .",
    "this result might suggest that there exists a symmetry lowing which can not be detected by x - ray diffraction .",
    "similar symmetry lowing is observed in the nmr spectra of @xmath31.@xcite the next thing to be pointed out is that the splitting is observed even in polycrystalline samples and at room temperature , in contrast to the case of @xmath6 . in alkaline - earth - metal doped",
    "@xmath8 , the local - density approximation calculations show a strong hybridization between the alkaline - earth - atom states and the @xmath8 @xmath33 states.@xcite this hybridization , which is absent in the alkali - metal doped @xmath8 , may play an essential role for the splitting of low frequency @xmath1 modes at room temperature .    for the components of low frequency @xmath1 modes ,",
    "a clear relation between line shift and line broadening is observed in @xmath2 , which is similar to that of single crystal @xmath6 .",
    "winter and kuzmany have pointed out that the electron - phonon interaction plays an important role in the broadening and the shift of the lines , and they deduced electron - phonon coupling constants.@xcite the phonon linewidth broadening @xmath34 due to the electron - phonon interaction in a metal can be related to a dimensionless electron phonon coupling constant @xmath35 given by @xcite @xmath36 where n(0 ) the density of states at the fermi level per spin and molecule , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 the mode degeneracy and the frequency before any coupling to the electrons , respectively . the allen s formula given above",
    "will be used to derive the coupling constants for the eight @xmath1 modes .",
    "frequencies of pure @xmath8 were used as the bare phonon frequencies .    in the framework of allen s theory",
    "there should be a linear relation of the form@xcite @xmath39 between @xmath27 the linewidth and @xmath40 the difference between the bare phonon frequency and the observed frequency . according to the experimental values of the three lowest frequency @xmath1 modes in table i",
    ", the relations between linewidth and frequency shift is plotted in fig.5 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath40 relation for @xmath2 is linear and consistent with that expected from eq.(2 ) .",
    "n(0 ) can be deduced from the slope .",
    "the density of states obtained from the three @xmath1 modes are 7 ev@xmath41 , 4 ev@xmath41 and 3.2 ev@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy may arise from the fact that we could not use the real bare phonon frequencies for the evaluation .",
    "geometry effects may also contribute to the shift and may be different for the modes . for @xmath3 , there exists no relation between the linewidth and lineshift in fig.5b .",
    "n(0 ) is much less than 1 ev@xmath41 if it were deduced basing on the relation between linewidth and lineshift in fig.5b .",
    "it suggests @xmath3 could not follow electron - phonon coupling theory .",
    "it further supports that @xmath2 is superconducting phase , rather than @xmath42 . for the evaluation of the coupling constants as discussed below a value of 7 @xmath4",
    "is used for n(0 ) .",
    "to our knowledge , no n(0 ) for @xmath2 is available .",
    "the calculated n(0 ) is 4.3 states per ev@xcite and an experimental value of 5.6 @xmath4 was reported for @xmath3 . @xcite the averaged linewidths and the overall coupling constants for each mode and for all @xmath1 modes for @xmath2 are listed in table ii , together with the frequencies for the pure @xmath8 .",
    "the averaged linewidths are directly evaluated from the linewiths listed in table i. the values for @xmath35 are evaluated using eq.(1 ) .",
    "the individual contributions to the coupling constant from each @xmath1 mode are listed in table ii .",
    "the three lowest frequency @xmath1 modes dominate the contribution to @xmath5 , yielding over 70% of the total value .",
    "large coupling constants of the low @xmath1 modes were also observed in @xmath6.@xcite within the bcs framework , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath43 can been evaluated basing on the experimental values for @xmath5 by the mcmillan equation @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the logarithmic averaged phonon frequency , @xmath46 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath47 is coulomb repulsion between conduction electrons .",
    "according to the observed frequencies and the evaluated coupling constants , the @xmath45 was determined as 490 @xmath19 . with this value and @xmath5 ,",
    "the superconducting transition temperature of 7 k can be evaluated , assuming the @xmath47 value as 0.3 , however , which is anomalously large .",
    "the value for @xmath47 is much larger than 0.18 in @xmath6 in the same way for evaluation of @xmath43 .",
    "it might suggest a difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 superconductors . to evaluate @xmath43 , on the other hand , the logarithmic averaged phonon frequency of 150 @xmath19",
    "is obtained if the @xmath47 is set as a reasonable value 0.2 . in this case , the phonon frequency is significantly smaller than the intramolecular vibration range .",
    "interestingly , the small phonon energy associated with superconductivity is also suggested by analysis of another @xmath14 superconductor @xmath48.@xcite    let us switch to the arguments on the totally symmetric @xmath15 modes .",
    "figure 6 shows the raman shift of the @xmath7 pentagonal pinch mode as a function of nominal charge transfer simply derived from the chemical formula for @xmath0 . in this figure",
    ", we plotted the present results of @xmath0 , as well as that of @xmath25 reported by duclos et al .",
    "@xcite and the theoretical results of jishi and dresselhaus @xcite for comparison .",
    "since the plots of @xmath0 approximately fall on an extrapolation of @xmath25 or theoretical line , the charge transfer value from ba to @xmath8 is almost complete .",
    "the molecular valences of @xmath0 ( x=3 , 4 , 6 ) are regarded as -6 , -8 , and -12 , respectively . however , the situation is more complicated than the case of alkali doped materials .",
    "several band calculations and experiments @xcite suggest a strong effect of hybridization of ba and @xmath8 orbitals . if this is the case , the net charge transfer to @xmath8 is expected to be incomplete . in the present result ,",
    "however , the charge transfer is approximately complete .",
    "moreover , the slope of @xmath0 is steeper than that of @xmath25 or theory .",
    "these results indicate that the phonon mode should be reconsidered in the presence of metal - fullerene hybridization . especially , there is a difference of 10 @xmath19 between the experimental and theoretical values for @xmath3 .",
    "the theory of jishi and dresselhaus focuses on the mode softening of the tangential vibrational @xmath15 mode for the alkali - metal derived fullerides , the hydridization between intercalants and @xmath8 was not considered .",
    "it can be seen from table i that the frequency of the radial @xmath15 mode for @xmath49 is 506 @xmath19 .",
    "the upshift is as high as 13 @xmath19 relative to pure @xmath8 .",
    "but , upon further doping with barium , the frequency nearly remains unchanged , being different from alkali - metal doped @xmath8 , which shows a continuous hardening of @xmath22 mode as a function of alkali metal concentration.@xcite the mode - stiffening effect is due to electrostatic interactions which produces sufficient stiffening to encounter the softening of the mode expected on the basis of charge - transfer effects.@xcite in the case of ba derived fullerides , there exists a strong hybridization between the ba atoms and the @xmath9-type functions of the @xmath8 network .",
    "this may lead to a decrease in the electrostatic interactions , so that the frequency of the radial @xmath50 mode nearly remains unchanged with increasing ba concentration .",
    "raman scattering studies of single phase @xmath16 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 have been carried out .",
    "the lowest frequency @xmath1 modes split in to five components for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . a characteristic relation between lineshift and linewidth",

    "the radial @xmath15 mode shows a different behavior from alkali derived fullerides , the frequency remains unchanged with increasing ba concentration ; the effect of charge transfer on the softening of the tangential @xmath15 mode is larger in the alkaline - earth metal doped @xmath8 than in alkali derived @xmath8 .",
