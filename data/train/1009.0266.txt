    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite ( mssm ) was introduced to solve several problems that arise in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these include : the hierarchy problem that requires the fine - tuning of theoretical parameters in order to obtain cancellation of large quantum corrections to the higgs mass ; the lack of convergence of the strong , weak , and electromagnetic gauge couplings at the grand - unification energy scale ; and the lack of a dark matter candidate .",
    "the mssm assigns a new bosonic counterpart to each sm fermion and likewise a fermionic superpartner to each sm boson .",
    "this results in scalar partners @xmath4 and @xmath5 to the sm quark helicity states @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". there can be two supersymmetric mass eigenstates for each supersymmetric quark ( squark ) corresponding to the two fermionic degrees - of - freedom of the sm quark .",
    "the supersymmetric scalar top quark ( stop ) mass eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath9 are rotated relative to @xmath10 and @xmath11 by a mixing angle @xmath12 . in some models",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 .",
    "the large mass of the top quark and the corresponding large value of the top - to - higgs coupling constant may lead to a large splitting between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "consequently the lower mass stop quark eigenstate is expected to be the lightest of all the squarks , with a mass even below the top quark , making its detection at the tevatron a realistic possibility .",
    "the mssm possesses a new conserved quantity called @xmath1-parity ( @xmath16 ) , defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the baryon number , @xmath19 is the lepton number , and @xmath20 is the spin . as a consequence ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) must be stable , and is a dark matter candidate . because the initial state of @xmath21 collisions has @xmath22 and supersymmetric particles have @xmath23 , supersymmetric particles must be pair - produced . at the tevatron stop quarks are expected to be produced primarily through gluon - gluon ( @xmath24 ) fusion and quark - antiquark ( @xmath25 ) annihilation , with @xmath24 fusion dominant at low stop masses ( @xmath26  gev/@xmath3 ) and @xmath25 annihilation dominant at higher stop masses @xcite .",
    "the produced stop ( @xmath27 ) quarks can decay via several possible channels , depending on the masses of the particles involved .",
    "two - body decays include @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lightest neutralino and @xmath32 the lightest chargino .",
    "these decays may not be kinematically possible for a light stop or they may be suppressed by higher order diagrams .",
    "they are also constrained by existing limits @xcite .",
    "possible three - body decays include @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the supersymmetric lepton and @xmath37 the supersymmetric neutrino .",
    "limits on the supersymmetric lepton and neutralino masses from experiments at the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) @xcite restrict the range of stop masses available to the first two decay modes .",
    "the decay @xmath35 , which proceeds via a virtual chargino , is the subject of this analysis .",
    "we assume the branching ratio for this decay mode is 100% and that electrons , muons , and taus are equally likely decay products .",
    "while electrons and muons are detected directly , taus are only included opportunistically in this analysis through their decays into electrons and muons .",
    "we also assume that the supersymmetric neutrino decays neutrally into the lsp ( or is the lsp ) , thus escaping undetected and leading to missing transverse energy ( @xmath38@xmath39 ) @xcite in the detector .",
    "since stop quarks are produced in pairs , we search for events with two opposite - charge leptons ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , @xmath38@xmath39 , and at least one hadronic jet .    previous searches at lep and at the tevatron @xcite for the stop quark using the same topology as this analysis have produced negative results .",
    "these analyses have set @xmath43 confidence level exclusion limits in the stop - sneutrino mass plane .",
    "this paper extends the earlier cdf results based on 107 pb@xmath2 of data at @xmath44  tev to 1 fb@xmath2 at @xmath0  tev .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section ii details the detector and the data set ; sections iii describes the background estimation ; section iv the signal predictions and systematic uncertainties ; section v event pre - selection and control samples ; section vi explains the optimization of event selection cuts ; and section vii presents the results and conclusions .",
    "the data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath2 of @xmath21  collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96  tev collected with the cdf detector @xcite at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "of particular relevance to this analysis are the tracking system , the calorimetry , and the muon detectors .",
    "the tracking system consists of two silicon micro - strip detectors and a multi - wire open - cell drift chamber , the central outer tracker ( cot ) .",
    "the silicon vertex detector ( svx ) and the intermediate silicon layers cover the pseudorapidity @xcite region @xmath45 while the cot covers @xmath46 .",
    "the tracking system is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid with a magnetic field of 1.4 t. the relative track momentum resolution provided by the cot is @xmath47(gev/@xmath48)@xmath2 .    outside the magnet in the radial direction",
    "are electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters arranged in a projective tower geometry with a tower granularity of @xmath49 in the central region .",
    "the central electromagnetic calorimeter ( cem ) utilizes lead - scintillator sampling and covers @xmath50 , with energy resolution for electrons @xmath51 .",
    "the central electromagnetic shower maximum detector ( ces ) is located inside the cem at a depth of six radiation lengths , close to the position of maximum electromagnetic shower development , and is used for the determination of the shower shape and for matching the shower location to the track extrapolation .",
    "the central hadron calorimeter ( cha ) uses iron - scintillator sampling and covers @xmath52 .",
    "its energy resolution for hadrons is @xmath53 .",
    "additional calorimetry extends the coverage in the forward direction and is used in this analysis for calculating @xmath38@xmath39 and jet energies but not for lepton identification .",
    "the plug electromagnetic calorimeter covers @xmath54 and is constructed of lead and scintillator layers with an energy resolution for electrons of @xmath55 .",
    "the plug hadron calorimeter covers @xmath56 and is constructed of iron and scintillator layers with an energy resolution for hadrons of @xmath57 .",
    "the iron and scintillator wall hadron calorimeter covers the intermediate region @xmath58 between the central and plug hadron calorimeters .",
    "its energy resolution is @xmath59 .",
    "radially outside the calorimetry is the muon detection system .",
    "the parts of the muon detector relevant to this analysis are the central muon detector ( cmu ) , the central muon upgrade detector ( cmp ) and the central muon extension ( cmx ) .",
    "the cmu consists of four - layer drift chambers and covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath60 .",
    "the cmp is made of four layers of single - wire drift cells located behind an additional 3.3 interaction lengths of steel and covers @xmath60 .",
    "muons with reconstructed track stubs found in both the cmu and cmp are labeled cmup muons .",
    "the cmx extends the coverage to @xmath46 and is made up of eight layers of drift tubes .",
    "the data were collected using a three - level trigger system .",
    "the first two levels are mostly hardware - based while the third level is software - based and is a fast version of the offline event reconstruction package .",
    "the online selection requires at least two lepton candidates falling into the following categories : cem - cem , cem - cmup , cem - cmx , cmup - cmup , and cmup - cmx , where the leptons are labeled by the detector components used in their identification .",
    "the triggers used in this analysis had an @xmath39 threshold of 4 gev for electrons and a @xmath61 threshold of 4 gev/@xmath48 for muons .",
    "all lepton candidates require the presence of a well - reconstructed track in the cot detector .",
    "offline , electrons are required to pass a @xmath62 comparison of the ces lateral shower profile in the @xmath63 view and the profile extracted from electron test - beam data .",
    "the shower position in the ces must also match the extrapolated position of the track .",
    "in addition , the lateral shower profile in the cem towers must be consistent with that expected from test - beam data .",
    "the energy deposited in the calorimeters must be consistent with the track momentum measurement and the energy deposition in the cha must be small . to reduce the background arising from the decay of hadrons in jets , the electrons are required to be isolated .",
    "isolated electrons are selected by requiring that the remaining transverse energy after subtracting the transverse energy associated with the electron in a cone of 0.4 in @xmath64 space ( @xmath65 ) must be less than 2 gev if @xmath66 gev or @xmath67 be less than 0.1 if @xmath6820 gev .",
    "electrons arising from photons that convert into @xmath69 pairs are removed by cuts applied to pairs of opposite - charge tracks with small opening angles .",
    "the electron identification efficiency was measured with drell - yan ( dy ) electrons to range from 75 to @xmath70 @xcite increasing with the electron @xmath39 .",
    "muons are identified by matching tracks with reconstructed track stubs in the cmup or cmx .",
    "the energy deposited in the calorimeters must be consistent with a minimum - ionizing particle .",
    "the isolation requirement is similar to that for electrons : @xmath71 gev if @xmath72 gev/@xmath48 or @xmath73 if @xmath74 gev/@xmath48 .",
    "the muon identification efficiency was measured with @xmath75 and @xmath76 data to be in the range @xmath77 @xcite rising with the muon @xmath61 .    for both electrons and muons",
    "the impact parameter ( @xmath78 ) of the track with respect to the beam line position must be less than 0.2 cm if the track is based on cot information only or less than 0.02 cm if silicon - based tracking is also available .",
    "the longitudinal position of the event vertex is required to be within 60 cm of the center of the detector .",
    "jets are identified in @xmath64 space as a group of electromagnetic and hadronic towers using a clustering algorithm with cone size @xmath79 .",
    "the jet energy resolution is @xmath80 gev for jets with @xmath81 gev . in order to find genuine hadronic jets and to avoid counting electrons and photons as jets ,",
    "the fraction of the total energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeters is required to be between 0.1 and 0.9 .",
    "corrections to the jet energy are applied to take into account @xmath82-dependent losses , luminosity - dependent multiple interactions , and non - linearities in calorimeter response @xcite . in this analysis",
    "we require at least one jet with @xmath45 and @xmath83 gev after corrections .",
    "@xmath38@xmath39 is calculated as the magnitude of the negative vector sum of the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter towers with @xmath84 and energy larger than 0.1 gev .",
    "since muons are minimum - ionizing particles and deposit only @xmath85 gev energy in the calorimetry , the muon momentum from tracking ( minus the expected energy deposition ) is used to correct @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "the energy corrections applied to jets with @xmath86 and @xmath87 gev are also propagated to the calculation of @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "several background sources result in events with dileptons , jets , and @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "these backgrounds are @xmath88 production , other heavy - flavor quark ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) production , dy production of lepton pairs where mismeasurement of a jet or lepton results in substantial @xmath38@xmath39 , diboson production ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ) , and events with a lepton and a misidentified or secondary lepton ( @xmath95+fake ) .",
    "the jets in most backgrounds result from qcd initial - state or final - state radiation ( isr or fsr ) .",
    "the @xmath88 , dy , and diboson backgrounds are estimated by generating monte carlo  ( mc ) events using the pythia @xcite event generator followed by a geant - based @xcite detector simulation .",
    "backgrounds arising from fake leptons and heavy flavor ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) are estimated using data - driven methods .",
    "the mc @xmath88 samples are normalized to the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) cross section @xmath96 pb @xcite with a top mass of 175 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 samples are normalized to a leading - order cross section times branching ratio of 1272 pb for @xmath100 gev/@xmath3 times a @xmath101-factor of 1.4 @xcite to correct for nlo contributions .",
    "the nlo cross sections times branching ratios for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are 1.27 , 0.365 , and 1.513 pb respectively @xcite . for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , we use the leading order cross section of 21.5 pb times a @xmath101-factor of 1.34 to account for nlo contributions @xcite",
    ".    the lepton plus fake background consists of events with a genuine lepton plus a `` fake '' lepton which is either a light hadron misidentified as a lepton or an uninteresting lepton from pion or kaon decay - in - flight . for muons",
    "the fakes can be particles that penetrate the calorimeters and absorbing material and reach the muon detectors or decay in flight to muons . in the case of electrons ,",
    "fakes are usually jets that are misidentified as electrons , mainly due to neutral pions that decay to photons which shower in the electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "this background is estimated by examining samples of single - lepton events taken with the @xmath107  gev electron calibration trigger and the @xmath108  gev/@xmath48 muon calibration trigger .",
    "events with at least one @xmath109 gev central jet ( @xmath50 ) or one isolated track with @xmath110 gev/@xmath48 passing the muon track quality cuts , excluding the trigger lepton , form the @xmath95+fake - electron and @xmath95+fake - muon candidate samples , respectively . to determine the background , it is necessary to estimate a fake rate from samples of jet events that contain a negligible number of directly produced leptons .",
    "four samples containing jets with @xmath111 , 50 , 70 , and 100 gev , respectively , are used .",
    "the electron fake rate is defined as the probability of a jet being misidentified as an electron and the muon fake rate as the probability of an isolated track being misidentified as a muon .",
    "the fake rates are determined as a function of jet @xmath39 for electrons and of track @xmath112 for muons .",
    "the fake rate for 20 gev electrons is about 0.0002 fakes per jet and the fake rate for 20 gev/@xmath48 muons is about 0.004 fakes per track .",
    "these fake rates are then applied to each fake - electron and fake - muon candidate , one at a time , in the single lepton sample .",
    "events that pass the analysis cuts are assigned a weight , which is the appropriate fake rate , scaled to the integrated luminosity of the dilepton data sample relative to the integrated luminosity of the single lepton sample , taking into account the single lepton trigger prescale .",
    "the sum of the weights then forms the @xmath95+fake background .",
    "a 50% systematic uncertainty on the misidentifed lepton background is assigned based upon the differences between the four jet samples used to determine the fake rates .",
    "the background arising from heavy - flavor ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) is estimated utilizing dilepton events enriched in heavy - flavor events by inverting the normal impact parameter requirements , i.e. @xmath113  cm for cot - only tracks and @xmath114  cm if the track included information from the svx , and requiring that at least one lepton pass the inverse @xmath78 cuts .",

    "the remaining events are attributed to heavy - flavor ( hf ) and are used to calculate scaling factors , defined as the ratio of these inferred hf events passing the normal @xmath78 cuts to the total number of events passing the above `` inverse @xmath78 '' cuts .",
    "it is assumed that this scaling ratio is independent of dilepton mass in regions not dominated by @xmath76 boson decays . to estimate the heavy - flavor background , the resulting scaling factors , typically of order 2 ,",
