    "the skyrme model @xcite is a non - linear theory for pions in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions with topological soliton solutions called skyrmions .",
    "the model can be used to describe , with due care @xcite , systems of a few nucleons , and has also been applied to nuclear and quark matter .",
    "one of the most complicated aspects of the physics of hadrons is the behavior of the phase diagram of hadronic matter at finite density at low or even zero temperature . particularly , the properties of zero - temperature skyrmions on a lattice are of interest , since the behavior of nuclear matter at high densities is now a focus of considerable interest . within the standard zero - temperature skyrme model description ,",
    "a crystal of nucleons turns into a crystal of half nucleons at finite density @xcite .",
    "to study skyrmion crystals one imposes periodic boundary conditions on the skyrme field and works within a unit cell ( equivalently , 3-torus ) @xmath0 ( @xcite , p. 382 ) .",
    "the first attempted construction of a crystal was by klebanov @xcite , using a simple cubic lattice of skyrmions whose symmetries maximize the attraction between nearest neighbors .",
    "other symmetries were proposed which lead to slightly lower , but not minimal , energy crystals @xcite .",
    "it is now understood that it is best to arrange the skyrmions initially as a face - centered cubic lattice , with their orientations chosen symmetrically to give maximal attraction between all nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "the skyrme model has an analogue in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions known as the baby skyrme model , also admitting stable field configurations of a solitonic nature characterized by integral topological charges @xcite . due to its lower dimension",
    ", it serves as a simplification of the original model , but nonetheless it has a physical relevance in its own right , as a variant of the model arises in ferromagnetic quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "this effective theory is obtained when the excitations relative to ferromagnetic quantum hall states are described , in terms of a gradient expansion in the spin density , a field with properties analogous to the pion field in the @xmath1d case @xcite .",
    "the baby skyrme model has also been studied in connection with baby skyrmion lattices under various settings @xcite and in fact , it is known that the baby skyrmions also split into half - skyrmions when placed inside a rectangular lattice @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , to date it hasnt been known if the rectangular periodic boundary conditions yield the true minimal energy configurations over all possible lattice types .",
    "conversely , if there are other non - rectangular baby skyrmion lattice configurations which have lower energy .",
    "finding the answers to these questions is thus of particular importance both because of their relevance to quantum hall systems in two - dimensions , and also because they may be used to conjecture the crystalline structure of nucleons in three - dimensions .    in two dimensions",
    "there are five lattice types as given by the crystallographic restriction theorem @xcite , in all of which the fundamental unit cell is a certain type of a parallelogram . to find the crystalline structure of the baby skyrmions , we place them inside different parallelograms with periodic boundary conditions and find the minimal energy configurations over all parallelograms of fixed area ( thus keeping the skyrmion density fixed ) . as we show later",
    ", there is a certain type of parallelogram , namely the hexagonal , which yields the minimal energy configuration . in particular , its energy is lower than the known ` square - cell ' configurations in which the skyrmion splits into half - skyrmions . as will be pointed out later , the hexagonal structure revealed here is not unique to the present model , but also arises in other solitonic models , such as ginzburg - landau vortices @xcite , quantum hall systems @xcite , and even in the context of @xmath1d skyrmions @xcite .",
    "the reason for this will be discussed in the concluding section .    in the following section we review the setup of our numerical computations , introducing a systematic way for the detection of the minimal energy crystalline structure of baby skyrmions . in subsequent sections we outline the numerical procedure through which the full field minimal configurations are obtained . in section",
    "[ sec : res ] we present the main results of our study and in section [ sec : semiana ] , a somewhat more analytical analysis of the problem is presented . in the last section",
    "we make some remarks with regards to future research .",
    "the target manifold in the baby skyrme model is described by a three - dimensional vector @xmath2 with the constraint @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 ) and its lagrangian density is : [ eq : babylag ] & = & 12 _ ^ - - ^2 ( 1 -_3 ) consisting of a kinetic term , a @xmath5d skyrme term , and a potential term .",
    "the static solutions of the model are those field configurations which minimize the static energy functional : e = 12 _ x y & ( ( _ x ) ^2 + ( _ y ) ^2 & + ^2 ( _ x _ y ) ^2 + & + 2 ^2 ( 1 -_3 ) ) & within each topological sector , where , in our setup , the integration is over parallelograms denoted here by @xmath6 : = \\{_1 ( l,0 ) + _ 2 ( s l , s l ): 0 _ 1,_2<1 } . here",
    "@xmath7 is the length of one side of the parallelogram , @xmath8 with @xmath9 is the length of its other side and @xmath10 is the angle between the ` @xmath8 ' side and the vertical to the ` @xmath7 ' side ( as sketched in fig .",
    "[ par ] ) .",
    "each parallelogram is thus specified by a set @xmath11 and the skyrmion density inside a parallelogram is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the topological charge of the skyrmion .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are taken into account by identifying each of the two opposite sides of a parallelogram as equivalent : ( ) = ( + n_1 ( l,0 ) + n_2 ( s l , s l ) ) , with @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in static finite - energy solutions , which in the language of differential geometry are @xmath15 maps .",
    "these are partitioned into homotopy sectors parameterized by an invariant integral topological charge @xmath13 , the degree of the map , given by : [ eq : o3bnumber ] b=14 _ x y ( ( _ x _ y ) ) . the static energy @xmath16 can be shown to satisfy [ ineq ] e 4 b with equality possible only in the ` pure ' @xmath17 case ( _ i.e. _ , when both the skyrme and the potential terms are absent ) @xcite .",
    "we note that while in the baby skyrme model on @xmath18 with fixed boundary conditions the potential term is necessary to prevent the solitons from expanding indefinitely , in our setup it is not required , due to the periodic boundary conditions @xcite . in this work we study the model both with and without the potential term .",
    "the problem in question can be simplified by a linear mapping of the parallelograms @xmath6 into the unit - area two - torus @xmath19 ( see fig . [ par ] ) . in the new coordinates ,",
    "the energy functional becomes    [ eq : t2energy ] e= _ _ 2 x y ( s^2 ( _ x ) ^2 -2 s _ x _ y + ( _ y ) ^2 ) + _ _ 2 x y ( _ x _ y ) ^2 + _ _ 2 x y ( 1 -_3 ) .    note that the dependence of the energy on the skyrme parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the skyrmion density @xmath22 is only through @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the parameterization of the fundamental unit - cell parallelogram @xmath6 ( in black ) and the two - torus @xmath19 into which it is mapped ( in gray).@xmath25,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in order to find the minimal energy configuration of skyrmions over all parallelograms with fixed area ( equivalently , a specified @xmath22 ) , we scan the parallelogram parameter space @xmath26 and find the parallelogram for which the resultant energy is minimal over the parameter space .",
    "an alternative approach to this problem , which is of a more analytical nature , has also been implemented , and is discussed in detail in section [ sec : semiana ] . in the following section we describe the numerical minimization procedure .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations derived from the energy functional ( [ eq : t2energy ] ) are non - linear _ pde _ s , so in general one must resort to numerical techniques .",
    "the minimal energy configuration of a skyrmion with charge @xmath13 and a given parallelogram ( defined by a set @xmath27 ) with a specified skyrmion density @xmath22 is found by a full - field relaxation method on a @xmath28 rectangular grid on the two - torus @xmath19 , where at each point a field triplet @xmath29 is defined . for the calculation of the energy and charge densities",
    ", we use the procedure devised by @xcite , in which the evaluation of these quantities is performed at the centers of the grid squares .",
    "numerical derivatives are also evaluated at these points ; the @xmath30-derivatives are calculated by & & |_(x_m+,y_n+ ) = + 1x & ( & _ normed + & - & _ normed ) , with the @xmath31-derivatives analogously defined , and the `` normed '' subscript indicates that the averaged fields are normalized to one .",
    "we find this procedure to work very well in practice .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of the method , see @xcite .",
    "the relaxation process begins by initializing the field triplet @xmath2 to a rotationally - symmetric configuration [ eq : initconfig ] _ = ( f(r ) b , f(r ) b , f(r ) ) , where the profile function @xmath32 is set to @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being the usual polar coordinates .",
    "the energy of the baby skyrmion is then minimized by repeating the following steps : a point @xmath36 on the grid is chosen at random , along with one of the three components of the field @xmath29 .",
    "the chosen component is then shifted by a value @xmath37 chosen uniformly from the segment @xmath38 $ ] where @xmath39 initially .",
    "the field triplet is then normalized and the change in energy is calculated .",
    "if the energy decreases , the modification of the field is accepted and otherwise it is discarded .",
    "the procedure is repeated , while the value of @xmath40 is gradually decreased throughout the procedure .",
    "this is done until no further decrease in energy is observed .    to check the stability and reliability of our numerical prescription",
    ", we set up the minimization scheme using different initial configurations and an @xmath41 grid for several @xmath22 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 values .",
    "this was done in order to make sure that the final configurations are independent of the discretization and of the cooling scheme . as a further check ,",
    "some of the minimizations were repeated with numerical derivatives of a higher precision , using eight field points for their evaluation .",
    "no apparent changes in the results were detected .",
    "using the minimization procedure presented in the previous section , we have found the minimal energy static skyrmion configurations over all parallelograms , for various settings : the ` pure ' @xmath17 case , in which both @xmath20 , the skyrme parameter , and @xmath21 , the potential coupling , are set to zero , the skyrme case for which only @xmath44 , and the general case for which neither the skyrme term nor the potential term vanish .    in each of these settings , the parameter space of parallelograms",
    "was scanned , while the skyrmion density @xmath22 is held fixed , yielding for each set of @xmath27 a minimal energy configuration .",
    "the choice as to how many skyrmions are to be placed inside the unit cells was made after some preliminary testing in which skyrmions of other charges ( up to @xmath45 ) were also examined .",
    "the odd - charge minimal - energy configurations turned out to have substantially higher energies than even - charge ones , where among the latter , the charge - two skyrmion was found to be the most fundamental , as it was observed that it serves as a ` building - block ' for the higher - charge ones . in what follows ,",
    "a summary of the results is presented .",
    "the pure @xmath17 case corresponds to setting both @xmath20 and @xmath21 to zero . in this case ,",
    "analytic solutions in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions may be found @xcite and the minimal energy configurations , in all parallelogram settings , saturate the energy bound in ( [ ineq ] ) giving @xmath47 .",
    "thus , comparison of our numerical results with the analytic solutions serves as a useful check on the precision of our numerical procedure .",
    "the agreement is to @xmath48 significant digits .",
    "contour plots of the charge densities for different parallelogram settings for the charge - two skyrmions are shown in fig .",
    "[ ck0 ] , all of them of equal energy @xmath49 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the energy functional ( [ eq : t2energy ] ) depends both on the skyrme field @xmath2 and on the parallelogram parameters @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "formally , the minimal energy configuration over all parallelograms may be obtained by functional differentiation with respect to @xmath2 and regular differentiation with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath42 . however , since the resulting equations are very complicated , a direct numerical solution is quite hard .",
    "nonetheless , some analytical progress may be achieved in the following way . as a first step ,",
    "we differentiate the energy functional ( [ eq : t2energy ] ) only with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath42 : [ eq : sgder ] & = & ( ( ^yy + s^2 ^xx ) -2 s ^xy ) = 0 , + & = & ( ^yy - s^2 ^xx ) = 0 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . solving these equations for @xmath43 and @xmath42 yields [ eq : sgammamin ] s & = & , + & = & . substituting these expressions into the energy functional ( [ eq : t2energy ] )",
    ", we arrive at a ` reduced ' functional [ eq : rede ] e= + _ + _ , where @xmath52 is the skyrme energy and @xmath53 is the potential energy . now that both @xmath43 and @xmath42 are eliminated from the resultant expression , and the conditions for their optimization are built into the functional , the numerical minimization is carried out .",
    "we note here , however , that the procedure presented above should be treated with caution .",
    "this is since the ` minimization ' conditions for @xmath43 and @xmath42 in ( [ eq : sgammamin ] ) are in fact only extremum conditions , and may turn out to be maximum or saddle - point conditions .",
    "hence , it is important to confirm any results obtained using this method by comparing them with corresponding results obtained from the method described in the previous section .",
    "it is therefore reassuring that numerical minimization of the reduced functional ( [ eq : rede ] ) gives @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 ( both for the skyrme case and the general case ) , confirming the results presented in the previous section .    in the general ( @xmath57 ) case , the energy functional ( [ eq : rede ] )",
    "may be further differentiated with respect to the skyrmion density @xmath22 to obtain the optimal density for which the skyrmion energy is minimal . differentiating with respect to @xmath22 , and substituting",
    "the obtained expression into the energy functional , results in the functional [ eq : rede2 ] e= + .",
    "numerical minimization of the above expression for @xmath58 and various @xmath21 values ( @xmath59 ) yielded the hexagonal setting as in the skyrme case .",
    "in particular , for @xmath60 the optimal density turned out to be @xmath61 , in accord with results presented in sub - section [ subsec : general ] .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the crystalline structure of baby skyrmions in two dimensions by finding the minimal energy configurations of baby skyrmions placed inside parallelogramic fundamental unit cells and imposing periodic boundary conditions . in the pure @xmath17 case ( where both the skyrme and potential terms are absent ) , we verified that there are no favorable lattices in which the skyrmions order themselves , as all parallelogram settings yielded the same minimal energy , saturating the minimal energy bound given by inequality ( [ ineq ] ) .    in the skyrme case , without the potential term , the results are different . for any fixed skyrmion density ,",
    "the parallelogram for which the skyrmion energy is minimal turns out to be the hexagonal lattice ( for which @xmath56 and @xmath62 ) . in particular , the hexagonal lattice has lower energy than the four half - skyrmions configuration on the rectangular lattice .",
    "for example , at @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the hexagonal lattice vs. @xmath65 for the rectangular lattice .",
    "the hexagonal setting turns out to be the energetically most favorable also in the general case with both the skyrme term and the potential term . in this case , however , the model is not scale invariant and the skyrmion has a definite size",
    ". this results in the existence of a phase transition as a function of density and the appearance of an optimal density , for which the total energy of the skyrmion is minimal .",
    "this is analogous to the skyrmion behavior in the @xmath1d skyrme model , in which the skyrmions also possess a definite size @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the special role of the hexagonal lattice revealed here is not unique to the baby skyrme model , but in fact arises in other solitonic models . in the context of skyrme models ,",
    "the existence of a hexagonal two dimensional structure of @xmath1d skyrmions has been found by @xcite , where it has already been noted that energetically , the optimum infinite planar structure of @xmath1d skyrmions is the hexagonal lattice , which resembles the structure of a graphite sheet , the most stable form of carbon thermodynamically ( @xcite , p. 384 ) . other examples in which the hexagonal structure is revealed are ginzburg - landau vortices which are known to have lower energy in a hexagonal configuration than in a square lattice configuration @xcite .",
    "thus , it should not come as a surprise that the hexagonal structure is found to be the most favorable in the baby skyrme model .    as briefly noted in the introduction ,",
    "a certain type of baby skyrmions also arise in quantum hall systems as low - energy excitations of the ground state near ferromagnetic filling factors ( notably @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that this state contains a finite density of skyrmions @xcite , and in fact the hexagonal configuration has been suggested as a candidate for their lattice structure @xcite .",
    "our results may therefore serve as a supporting evidence in that direction , although a more detailed analysis is in order .",
    "our results also raise some interesting questions .",
    "the first is how the dynamical properties of baby skyrmions on the hexagonal lattice differ from their behavior in the usual rectangular lattice .",
    "another question has to do with their behavior in non - zero - temperature settings .",
    "one may also wonder whether and how these results can be generalized to the @xmath1d case , once a systematic study like the one reported here is conducted .",
    "is the face - centered cubic lattice indeed the minimal energy crystalline structure of @xmath1d skyrmions among all parallelepiped lattices ? if not , what would the minimal energy structure be ? and how would these results change when a mass term is present ?",
    "we hope to answer these questions in future research .",
