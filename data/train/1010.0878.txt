    "the most general spherically symmetric solution to einstein equations allows for the anisotropy of principal pressures ; the radial pressure may differ from the transverse pressure . while the isotropic fluid with specified equation of state ( eos ) is the most common source for modeling newtonian or relativistic stars , anisotropy of principal pressures",
    "can be found when the source is derived from field theories , e.g.  when scalar fields are considered as in boson stars @xcite , or in configurations involving electrically charged matter .",
    "one also finds that anisotropy of pressures is present in the so called `` exotic solutions '' to einstein equations such as wormholes @xcite or gravastars @xcite .",
    "interesting features of relativistic anisotropic spheres were pointed out as early as 1933.by lematre @xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite is widely considered as the beginning of the epoch of more active research , see @xcite for a review .",
    "recently , general algorithms for generating static anisotropic solutions to einstein equations have been formulated ( see @xcite and references therein . ) however , whether such solutions are considered more or less physically acceptable depends on a number of criteria which include fulfillment of various energy conditions of general relativity , the requirement that the speed of sound in the fluid is subluminal , and perhaps most importantly , stability of the configurations with respect to perturbations .",
    "the most notable technique for the analysis of stability of isotropic relativistic stars with respect to radial perturbations is that of chandrasekhar @xcite . in this procedure",
    "the time dependent einstein equations are linearized around the equilibrium solution to yield a linear wave equation for radial perturbations , which together with appropriate boundary conditions comprises an eigenvalue problem of the sturm  liouville type .",
    "positive eigenvalues are interpreted as ( squares of ) frequencies of normal modes of radial pulsations , while negative eigenvalues imply exponentially growing perturbations , i.e.  instability of the sphere ( for in - depth coverage see @xcite ) .",
    "another field - proven technique , known as the @xmath0 method , can be applied to locate the onset of instability in one - parameter families of equilibrium solutions to einstein equations satisfying the same eos of cold matter @xcite . using the central energy density as the parameter and increasing its value",
    ", the first maximum in the @xmath0 curve indicates the boundary between the stable and unstable configurations .",
    "while more limited both in its scope and insights into the dynamics of the system it can provide relative to the full analysis of the normal modes , the @xmath0 technique is very simple in circumstances where for the given eos the equilibrium configurations can be generated over a sufficiently wide parameter range .    in the context of anisotropic",
    "stars the normal modes technique was applied to study the stability of some specific configurations in @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 method could not be straightforwardly applied because most of the solution - generating techniques mentioned above could not generate sequences of equilibrium configurations corresponding to one fixed eos .",
    "the only framework outside of isotropic spheres where the @xmath0 method was successfully applied is that of elastic stars . in the second paper in the series beginning with @xcite the @xmath0 method was shown to predict instability exactly at the configuration that has vanishing frequency of the fundamental normal mode of radial pulsation , i.e.  the two methods were shown to give compatible results .",
    "in this paper we will first show how a sequence of anisotropic spheres of different masses and surface radii can be generated from one given eos .",
    "this will enable us to use the @xmath0 method to study stability , and we will compare the results to those of the analysis of normal modes .",
    "the paper begins ( section  [ sec : eos ] ) with the discussion of the concept of the quasi - local eos for the anisotropic fluid in spherical symmetry . in section  [ sec : waveq ] we derive the linear wave equation for radial perturbations for a specific quasi - local eos where the radial pressure is described by the arbitrary barotropic eos , @xmath1 , while the anisotropy is taken to be the arbitrary function of the energy density and the compactness , @xmath2 , which is a quasi - local variable . in section  [ sec : anisotropes ] we apply the above concepts to specific examples ; we study the structure and stability of solutions obtained from the quasi - local eos consisting of the polytropic eos governing the radial pressure and the anisotropy of pressures taken to be bilinear in the radial pressure and the compactness .",
    "we close with a brief discussion of the results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "energy  momentum tensor of the perfect fluid can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy density and @xmath5 is the isotropic pressure of the fluid , @xmath6 is its four - velocity normalized so that @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the metric tensor .",
    "the combination @xmath9 is the projection tensor onto the spatial hypersurface orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity .",
    "the notion of the _ anisotropic _ fluid allows the pressures to differ among spatial directions .",
    "in particular , in spherical symmetry , the radial pressure which we denote by @xmath5 may differ from the transverse pressure which we denote by @xmath10 . to write down the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the anisotropic fluid in spherical symmetry , in addition to the four - velocity @xmath6 , one introduces the ` radial ' spatial unit vector @xmath11 that is orthogonal to the four - velocity and has no angular components , i.e.  @xmath12 , @xmath13 . the energy  momentum tensor of the anisotropic fluid can now be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the projection tensor onto the 2-surface orthogonal to both @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the vector @xmath11 is not defined at the centre of symmetry the anisotropy of pressures must vanish at this point .    to illustrate the role of the anisotropy of pressures in the dynamics of the fluid it is worthwhile to consider the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the co - moving 3-volume of the fluid element , @xmath4 and @xmath18 are respectively the energy density and temperature of the fluid",
    ", @xmath19 is the entropy and @xmath20 is the work done by the fluid element . assuming no energy flow among the neighboring fluid elements we have @xmath21 . in the case of the isotropic pressure",
    "the work done by the fluid element due to the change in its volume is @xmath22 .",
    "dividing by the element of the proper time along the world line of the fluid element one can write @xmath23 where the relative change of the volume , @xmath24 , can be recognized as the spacetime expansion scalar . applying the chain rule on the lhs  of ( [ eq : firstlaw ] ) , dividing by @xmath25 and using ( [ eq : dwiso ] ) , for the isotropic fluid one obtains the well known relation @xmath26    turning now to the work done by the element of the anisotropic fluid we must , due to the difference among the principal pressures , accordingly distinguish between different directions of expansion . in spherical symmetry we distinguish between the radial and the transverse expansion : @xmath27 where the radial expansion can be written as @xmath28 .",
    "the work due to the expansion of the element of the anisotropic fluid is @xmath29 and the anisotropic analogue of ( [ eq : firstlawiso ] ) follows as @xmath30 the last term on the rhs  is proportional to the anisotropy of the pressures and vanishes in case of the isotropic fluid , thus reducing ( [ eq : firstlawaniso ] ) to ( [ eq : firstlawiso ] ) .",
    "however , ( [ eq : firstlawaniso ] ) can also be obtained from the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the anisotropic fluid ( [ eq : anisot ] ) by taking the component of the conservation law @xmath31 directed along the world line of the fluid element , @xmath32 , while the projection of @xmath31 onto the hypersurface orthogonal to the four - velocity gives the anisotropic version of the euler equation of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of the isotropic fluid is usually understood as a relation among the energy density and the pressure of the fluid , and possibly other _",
    "local _ fluid variables such as temperature , baryon density , entropy per baryon , etc .",
    "these variables are considered local because their values refer to the state of the fluid at the particular spacetime point , rendering the eos independent of any non - local information .",
    "the local eos describing the isotropic fluid can be cast in the form of a single equation : @xmath33 dots representing additional local variables .",
    "the simplest case is the barotropic eos @xmath34 , or as it is often written @xmath35 , that can be taken to , e.g. , describe the stellar matter at the end of nuclear burning and at zero temperature .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the barotropic eos suffices to close the static einstein equations in spherical symmetry , and as shown in @xcite , a given barotropic eos with pressure monotonically increasing in energy density guarantees the existence of a family of solutions with central energy density as the sole parameter .    in analogy to the case of the barotropic eos for the isotropic fluid , one could expect the simplest anisotropic eos to be of the form @xmath1 for the radial , and @xmath36 for the transverse pressure .",
    "however , a simple argument can be given to show that such eos is overly restrictive to allow for a family of solutions with different central energy densities .",
    "we begin by assuming the existence of a static spherically symmetric solution governed by the eos of the form @xmath1 and @xmath36 , with energy density @xmath37 at @xmath38 ( centre of symmetry ) and non - vanishing anisotropy of pressures at some @xmath39 .",
    "since at @xmath38 the anisotropy of pressures must vanish we have @xmath40 . at @xmath41",
    "we have @xmath42 by assumption , so it follows that @xmath43 .",
    "if we now consider the possibility of constructing the solution with central energy density equal to @xmath44 , we find that the condition of vanishing anisotropy of pressures at @xmath38 can not be satisfied .",
    "the eos for the anisotropic fluid must , therefore , have more complex structure than what was just assumed .",
    "the idea behind the _ quasi - local _ eos , which we borrow from @xcite , is to allow for the dependence on the quantities that can be derived from the geometry at a given point of the spacetime . in principle",
    "an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a spacetime point suffices to measure the ( orthonormal frame ) components of the riemann tensor .",
    "these components , in turn , allow one to construct quantities that can be considered as quasi - local variables",
    ". in spherical symmetry the general quasi - local eos will have the form of a system @xmath45 where @xmath46 denote the local variables , and @xmath47 denote the quasi - local variables .",
    "the quasi - local variables of special interest could be the curvature radius @xmath48 or the compactness @xmath49 ; for orthonormal frame components of the riemann tensor in spherical symmetry see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the local or quasi - local variables as defined above , _ non - local _ variables were defined as arbitrary functionals over the whole , or some finite segment of the @xmath50 slice of the spacetime @xcite . while in principle",
    "arbitrary functionals can appear in the static limit of the eos , this concept might turn out to be problematic when dynamics is considered .",
    "namely , it is not clear how a perturbation of the fluid in the neighborhood of some spacetime point would affect the value of an arbitrary functional , and consequently the state of the fluid , elsewhere in the spacetime .",
    "the ` immediate effect ' of the perturbation on the functional would violate the principle of causality , while physically acceptable ( causal ) propagation would require the input of additional physics , implying that a non - local eos alone does not fully describe the fluid .",
    "however , the ` average energy density up to @xmath48 ' , @xmath51 which is used as an example of a non - local variable in @xcite can , in fact , be understood as a quasi - local variable since @xmath52 , where @xmath2 and @xmath48 are acceptable quasi - local variables @xcite .",
    "here we derive the linear wave equation for the radial perturbations of the anisotropic fluid governed by the specific form of the quasi - local eos ( [ eq : anisoeos ] ) .",
    "we assume that in the rest frame of the fluid its energy density @xmath4 and the pressures @xmath5 and @xmath10 are related by @xmath53 where the quasi - local variable @xmath54 is the compactness , @xmath55 , @xmath56 being the usual mass function .",
    "the procedure that follows is a generalization of the one originally carried out for the isotropic case by chandrasekhar @xcite , while our notation is ( to the extent possible ) compatible with misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite , ch .",
    "the line element of the spherically symmetric spacetime in the standard coordinates @xmath57 , @xmath48 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the line element on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "the metric function @xmath64 is related to the compactness @xmath54 and to the mass function @xmath56 by @xmath65    denoting with @xmath66 the radial displacement of a fluid element from its equilibrium position @xmath48 at time @xmath57 , the nonzero components of the four - velocity normalized so that @xmath67 are @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",

    "one now assumes the existence of a static or equilibrium ( time independent ) solution to the einstein equations and proceeds to study the dynamics of small perturbations . at a fixed point in the coordinate grid",

    "we explicitly compute the solutions to the boundary value problem consisting of ( [ eq : uode ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath180 and @xmath181 this task is technically nontrivial because with the eos ( [ eq : eosfinal ] ) the point @xmath119 is a regular singular point of ( [ eq : uode ] ) , as can be shown by the following consideration .",

    "result the asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients of ( [ eq : c2])-([eq : c0 ] ) as @xmath124 follows as @xmath184 due to the vanishing of @xmath185 , the point @xmath119 is a regular singular point of ( [ eq : uode ] ) , which allows for unbounded solutions .",
    "however , regularity of the solutions can be enforced by integrating ( [ eq : uode ] ) as an initial value problem starting from @xmath119 with the initial condition @xmath181 and @xmath186 ( we note that due to simplicity of the eos ( [ eq : eosfinal ] ) the above boundary condition coincides with equation ( 7c ) of @xcite that was derived assuming an asymptotically polytropic eos describing the fluid with isotropic pressures . ) due to the robustness of the numerical method @xcite , finding the eigenvalue @xmath136 and the eigenfunction @xmath187 satisfying the above boundary condition and also @xmath180 with @xmath188 nodes in @xmath138 for any equilibrium configuration is now a simple task .",
    "we are most interested in @xmath189 since , as discussed in the preceding section , if @xmath140 the equilibrium configuration is considered stable , while if @xmath141 it is considered unstable .",
    "for all solutions shown in figure  [ fig : one ] we computed the eigenvalue @xmath139 and observed that as the central energy density increases ( @xmath151 , @xmath150 and @xmath148 fixed ) it changes the sign from positive to negative exactly where , within the remarkable numerical precision of the procedures , the @xmath0 curves exhibit their maxima .",
    "in other words , the two methods we have applied to assess the stability properties of the equilibrium configurations obtained from the quasi - local eos gave compatible results .    in figure  [ fig : two ] we show a highly compact configuration obtained with @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath190 , and central energy density for which @xmath177 ( more details can be found in the figure caption . )",

    "we have shown that with the quasi - local variables one can construct equations of state ( eos ) to describe the anisotropic fluid in spherical symmetry .",
    "the quasi - local eos may be used to generate static anisotropic spheres over a wide range of radii and masses , by varying the central energy density as the parameter .",
    "we have also studied the stability of the configurations with respect to radial perturbations .",
    "the analysis of normal modes of radial pulsations and the @xmath0 method gave identical results .",
    "the numerical analysis of several examples revealed that when the transverse pressure is greater than the radial pressure , the maximal surface compactness ( @xmath198 ) of the spheres that can be obtained before the onset of instability is higher than that of isotropic spheres .",
    "another interesting feature is the outwardly increasing energy density in the cores of some stable configurations , despite of the fact that the radial pressure and the energy density are related by the polytropic eos ( figure  [ fig : two ] ) .",
    "( some may recall weinberg s remark on isotropic spheres that `` it is difficult to imagine that a fluid sphere with a larger density near the surface then near the centre would be stable '' @xcite ; we saw here that a similar structure can be supported by anisotropic pressures , whatsmore , it can be stable . ) therefore , the concept of the quasi - local eos has been shown to be useful in constructing interesting models of astrophysically plausible objects such as highly compact stars , especially since the @xmath0 method can be used to assess their stability properties .",
