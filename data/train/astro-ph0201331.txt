    "the ` standard ' model of cosmology , cdm , which assumes hierarchical buildup of structure , is facing difficulties in explaining observed properties of galaxies , such as the number density of dwarfs and the inner density profile of halos . standing out",
    "is the angular - momentum problem , that is the apparent failure of the theory , via simulations , to reproduce the large sizes of disk galaxies and their structure .",
    "we make progress by first reproducing the problem via a simple model in which the important physical elements are spelled out , and then incorporating in this model the key process which may cure the problem  feedback .    the sizes of disks are commonly linked to the spins of their parent halos as measured in n - body simulations [ 10 ] .",
    "the assumptions that the baryons and dm share the same distribution of specific angular momentum @xmath2 and that the baryons conserve their @xmath2 while contracting to a disk lead to disk sizes comparable to those observed",
    ". however , simulations that incorporate gas find that most of the baryonic @xmath2 is transfered to the dm , resulting in disk sizes smaller by an order of magnitude [ e.g.  14,15 ] , and thus leading to a _ spin catastrophe_.    in addition , there is a _ mismatch of @xmath2 profiles_. the @xmath2 distribution ( or profile ) within simulated halos has been found to scatter about a universal shape , with an excess of low-@xmath2 ( and high-@xmath2 ) material compared to the exponential disks observed [ 1 , bd ] .",
    "this mismatch has been demonstrated in an observed sample of 14 dwarf galaxies [ 18 , bbs ] , which serves as the target for our modeling effort .",
    "bbs used for each halo the measured rotation curve and an assumed nfw profile to determine the halo virial quantities , with an average @xmath3 .",
    "they then determined the baryonic spin parameter , averaging to @xmath4 , significantly larger than the @xmath5 of simulated halos , and then demonstrated the @xmath2-profile mismatch case by case .",
    "bbs also estimated the ratio of disk to dm mass to be @xmath6 , about a factor of 3 smaller than the universal fraction , indicating significant gas loss .",
    "the spin catastrophe is commonly being associated with  over - cooling \" , that the gas rapidly cools and becomes tightly bound in small halos .",
    "when such a halo spirals into a bigger halo , the baryonic component survives intact all the way to the center and thus transfers all its orbital @xmath2 to the dm .",
    "it has therefore been speculated that energy feedback from supernova may remedy the problem by balancing the early cooling [ e.g.  9 ] .",
    "a key idea is that the spin segregation between baryons and dm can go either way .",
    "while gas cooling tends to lower the baryonic spin , heating due to feedback would reduce this effect , and gas removal from small halos would even lead to higher baryonic spin .",
    "however , a realistic implementation of feedback has proved challenging [ e.g.  17 ] . the feedback process has not yet been studied or implemented in satisfactory detail .",
    "we do not know yet whether they can indeed solve the cdm problems , and how .",
    "this motivates our attempt to first understand how the feedback scenario may work using a very simple semi - analytic model . knowing that in a hierarchical scenario the halo fromation can be largely interpreted as a sequence of mergers , our model is based on a simple algorithm for the buildup of halo spin by adding up the orbital angular momenta of merging satellites [ 13 , mds ; 19 ] .",
    "it matches well the spin distribution among halos in n - body simulations as well as the @xmath2 profile within halos .",
    "this makes it a useful tool for understanding the over - cooling origin of the spin problem and for the attempt to cure it via feedback effects .",
    "our work is described in more detail in [ 12 , md ] .",
    "we characterize the angular momentum @xmath0 of a galaxy by the modified spin parameter bull:01 @xmath7 .",
    "this quantity , which equals the standard @xmath8 for an isothermal sphere and for an nfw profile with concentration @xmath9 , is straightforward to compute separately for the baryons and for the dm , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12 in the simulations is normal , with an average corresponding to @xmath13 ( compared to @xmath14 ) and a standard deviation @xmath15 .",
    "the  orbital - merger \" model of mds reproduces this spin distribution . to materialize this model",
    "we generate many random realizations of merger histories based on the extended press schechter formalism [ 11 ] with slight adjustments , and for each merger tree we create random realizations of the orbital @xmath16 added in each merger .",
    "the encounter parameters are taken to mimic typical mergers , with the directions of the orbits drawn at random ( or fine - tuned for a slight correlation between successive mergers as seen in simulations [ 5,16 ] .",
    "the resultant distribution of halo spins matches the log - normal distribution obtained in the simulations .",
    "the cumulative mass distribution of @xmath2 within simulated halos is fit by the universal function @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( bd ) .",
    "this is a simple power law , @xmath20 , for at least half the mass , with a possible bend characterized by @xmath21 .",
    "the other parameter , @xmath22 or @xmath23 , can be replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath21 is gaussian in @xmath25 , with a mean @xmath26 .",
    "the model also recovers these simulated @xmath2 profiles .",
    "we create an @xmath27 profile for each of the eps model realizations by dividing the mass growth of the halo into bins and assigning to each the corresponding orbital @xmath0 .",
    "a sample of profiles produced by this procedure and the distribution of @xmath21 values are shown in figs .  1 and 2 of md , demonstrating the match with the simulation results of bd .",
    "the model also reproduces the insensitivity to halo mass and redshift .",
    "the successes of the simple model in recovering both the distribution of spins and the @xmath2 profiles makes it a useful tool for studying the @xmath2 buildup .",
    "a new feature revealed by the model , which provides an interesting clue , is that the final halo spin is predominantly determined by the last major merger , while the many smaller satellites come in at different directions and therefore tend to sum up to a low @xmath2 .",
    "if small satellites would lose gas before they merge into the halo , then much of the galactic gas would originate in big satellites , the final gas would lack the low-@xmath2 component , and the baryonic spin would end up higher than the dm .",
    "we can understand the @xmath2 loss of baryons via a simple model including gas cooling , dynamical friction and tidal stripping for how the orbital @xmath2 is converted into halo spin .",
    "first , the dynamical friction exerted by the halo on the satellite brings the satellite towards the halo center and thus transfers @xmath2 from the orbit to the halo .",
    "second , once satellite particles are tidally stripped they retain their @xmath2 at the stripping point and add it directly to the halo .    the mass loss at halo radius @xmath28 can be estimated by evaluating the tidal radius @xmath29 of the satellite at @xmath28 via the resonance condition , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass profiles of the satellite and halo .",
    "if these two are self - similar , then this implies @xmath33 , and the bound mass of the satellite is @xmath34 \\propto m(r)$ ] .",
    "a more accurate recipe for tidal stripping , tested with merger simulations , reveals that this is a good approximation in general [ 6 ] , so we adopt it in our model .",
    "when exploring the effect of cooling , one assumes that initially the baryons follow the dm .",
    "as the gas cools , it contracts to a more compact configuration of radius @xmath35 .",
    "this spatial segregation in the satellite implies that the @xmath2-rich mass stripped at the early stages of the merger in the outer halo is dominated by dm , while the more compact baryons penetrate into the inner halo and lose more of their @xmath2 via dynamical friction .",
    "the result is a net spin transfer from the baryons to the dm . using the stripping recipe @xmath36",
    ", we obtain for the final baryonic spin @xmath37 . in the case of maximum cooling ,",
    "the baryons dominate the halo center , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the universal baryon fraction .",
    "shows the resultant baryonic spin distribution according to this model ; there is a shift down to @xmath40 , reproducing the spin crisis .",
    "the role of feedback would be to delay the cooling , increase @xmath41 , and thus reduce the baryonic spin loss .",
    "our approach here is to avoid the details of star formation and feedback and rather appeal to a very simple prescription for the effect of feedback as a function of the satellite s virial velocity , @xmath42 . following the analysis of dekel & silk [ 8 ]",
    ", we assume that the feedback by supernova - driven winds pumps energy into the gas and heats it uniformly to a temperature corresponding to a characteristic velocity @xmath43 , on the order of @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore assume that the spatial extent of the baryons is determined by the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the limit @xmath46 , of massive , deep potential wells , corresponds to maximum cooling , @xmath47 . in smaller halos , still with @xmath48 , we expect the heating to balance the cooling and yield @xmath49 .",
    "our model is therefore an interpolation between these limits , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 an arbitrary exponent , which we set for now to be unity .",
    "if @xmath43 is larger than @xmath42 , the feedback can cause gas blowout .",
    "we assume that partial blowout starts occurring once @xmath43 exceeds the escape velocity of the satellite , @xmath52 , while total blowout is expected for @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore parameterize the amount of gas that remains in the halo by another interpolation , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 an arbitrary exponent tentatively set to unity .",
    "we report here the results for the simplest choice @xmath56 , and explore the robustness of the results to different choices of @xmath51 and @xmath55 in md .    in",
    "we demonstrate the effects of this feedback scheme , with @xmath57 , on the distribution of @xmath10 .",
    "we do it for two kinds of final halos , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , representing _ dwarf _ and _ bright _ galaxies .",
    "the baryons in the bright galaxies end up with spins comparable to their dm halos , with @xmath60 , while in dwarfs they have significantly higher spins , with @xmath61 .",
    "we learn that @xmath10 in dwarfs , which are build up by small satellites , is dominated by the blowout from these satellites , and it ends up with @xmath62 . for bigger galaxies , which are largely made of bigger satellites , the dominant effect is the heating , with some contribution from blowout , together leading to a @xmath10 distribution similar to @xmath11 , in general agreement with observations .    in md",
    "we explore a range of values for the exponents @xmath51 and @xmath55 . for each choice",
    "we determine @xmath43 such that for the dwarfs @xmath63 as in bbs .",
    "we find that our results for dwarfs remain practically unchanged , while the results for bright galaxies have a weak dependence on the value of @xmath51 in the range @xmath64 .",
    "2.5 truecm    the distribution of @xmath65 for the dwarfs observed by bbs is displayed in , showing values significantly lower than the universal value of @xmath39 and thus consistent with baryonic blowout .",
    "shown for comparison are the model predictions for dwarf and bright galaxies .",
    "we enforced a match of the means for the dwarfs at @xmath63 by choosing @xmath66 , but the scatters are also in agreement . for bright galaxies ,",
    "@xmath65 is typically lower than the universal value by less than @xmath67 , reflecting the limited fraction of small progenitors who lost their gas .",
    "next , we compare predicted and observed spin distributions for dwarfs .",
    "we convert each value of @xmath8 as quoted by bbs to @xmath24 , and show their distribution in .",
    "the observed spins are significantly higher than the @xmath24 values of halos in cosmological simulations , with an average of @xmath68 compared to @xmath69 .",
    "then shown is our model prediction with @xmath70 for the baryonic spin distribution in dwarfs .",
    "the effect of blowout brings the baryonic spins to a good agreement with the observed dwarfs .    shows the average @xmath2 profiles and the scatter about them for the observed bbs dwarfs and for the corresponding model realizations compared to the typical @xmath2 profile in halos by bd .",
    "we construct the baryonic @xmath2 profile in each of our model realizations following the same method used to produce dm @xmath2 profiles but now including feedback effects .",
    "the bbs dwarfs show low baryonic fractions ( indicated by the integral under the histogram ) and significant deficits of @xmath2 at the two ends of the distribution compared to the halos .",
    "the profile for model dwarf galaxies is similar to the observations except for the very lowest @xmath2 bin which is a @xmath71 overestimate , representing a spike in some of the model realizations .",
    "this spike may correspond to a low-@xmath2 baryonic component that bbs fail to observe ( faint halo stars ? ) , or the spiky objects do not become disk dwarf galaxies , or our model needs to be improved . the high-@xmath2 tail tends to be reduced in the baryons because it is often the result of a small satellite that comes in with its orbital @xmath0 aligned with the halo spin , and now has lost its gas .",
    "4.2 truecm    also shows the average model prediction for bright galaxies , @xmath72 .",
    "they retain most of their baryons , so their profiles are less affected by blowout .",
    "the average model profile is in better agreement with an exponential disk , towards solving the @xmath2-profile discrepancy pointed our by bd .",
    "a quantity used by bbs to characterize the shape of the @xmath2 profile , as an alternative to the bd parameter @xmath21 , is @xmath73 . in we also plot the distribution of this quantity in the bbs dataset in comparison with our model predictions for the baryons in dwarf and bright galaxies .",
    "the predicted @xmath74 distribution for dwarfs is shifted upwards compared to the halos and the bright galaxies , in qualitative agreement with the bbs data , but the width is overestimated .",
    "we devised a simple model to address the @xmath2 problems of galaxy formation within cdm . by adding up the orbital @xmath16 in random realizations of merger histories",
    ", the model successfully reproduces the simulated distribution of spins among halos ( mds ) and the distribution of @xmath2 within halos ( md ) . a simple analysis of how the merger orbital @xmath2 turns into a spin profile provides a clue for how feedback effects in the satellite can resolve the spin problems .",
    "the idea is that the effective size of the gas component within the incoming halo determines its tidal stripping position in the big halo and thus its final remaining baryonic spin after the merger .",
    "the finding that the low-@xmath2 material originates in many minor mergers , that tend to cancel each other s @xmath16 , provides the clue for a possible solution to the @xmath2-profile mismatch problem .",
    "the blowout of gas from small incoming halos , which is more pronounced in satellites of dwarfs , would eliminate the low-@xmath2 baryons in the merger product and increase the spin parameter , as observed .",
    "the feedback effects , including heating and blowout , are modeled as a function of halo virial velocity , with one free parameter  the characteristic velocity @xmath43 corresponding to the feedback energy from supernovae . to match the low baryonic fraction observed in dwarfs it has to be @xmath75 , consistent with the theoretical predictions [ 8 ] .",
    "this leads to an agreement between the model predictions and the observed disks , for the distribution of baryonic spin among galaxies and the baryonic @xmath2 distribution within galaxies , both dwarfs and bright galaxies .    we attempt to resolve the problems within the successful cosmological framework of cdm , by appealing to inevitable feedback effects .",
    "another approach is to appeal to the warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenario , despite the fact that it requires fine - tuning of the particle mass to @xmath76 .",
    "the main feature of wdm is the suppression of small halos and the corresponding mergers .",
    "while an n - body simulation of wdm [ 2 ] indicates the same @xmath2 properties of halos ( the same properties can also be obtained as a general result of tidal - torque theory , see mds ) , one expects the cooling to be less efficient in the absence of small halos , and thus the baryonic spin to be higher .",
    "however , the @xmath2 profile is still expected to be a problem , and the weaker feedback effects in the absence of small halos may not be enough for resolving it .",
    "these issues are yet to be studied in hydro simulations of wdm .",
    "feedback effects may also provide the cure to the missing dwarf problem in cdm , where the predicted number of dwarf halos is much larger than the observed number of dwarf galaxies [ 3 ] .",
    "while the number of dwarfs is automatically suppressed in wdm , it seems that the inclusion of the minimum inevitable feedback effects would reduce the predicted number of dwarfs to significantly below the observed number and thus be an overkill ( j. bullock , private comm . ) . finally , we find [ 7 ] that the key elements of our toy model  the tidal effects in mergers and the feedback in small halos  are also very relevant in understanding and resolving the third problem of cdm , where the halos in simulations typically show steep cusps in their inner profiles [ 14 ] , while observations indicate flat cores at least in some galaxies [ 4 ] .",
    "an analysis of tidal effects explains the inevitable formation of an asymptotic cusp as long as satellites continue penetrating into the halo center .",
    "feedback effects may puff up small satellites , make them disrupt in the outer halo and thus allow a stable core .",
    "the success of our toy model in matching several independent observations indicates that it indeed captures the relevant elements of the complex processes involved , and in particular that feedback effects may indeed provide the cure to all three problems of galaxy formation in cdm",
    ". the next natural step should be to incorporate a more sophisticated feedback recipe into the model using semi - analytic models and then full - scale cosmological simulations .",
