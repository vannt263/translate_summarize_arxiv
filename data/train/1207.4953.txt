    "ugca105 ( see table  [ t1 ] for representative qualities ) is a magellanic - type irregular galaxy with ongoing star formation [ recent star formation as traced by the h@xmath12  emission line has been studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; while the total h@xmath12  luminosities differ slightly between these works , each finds a significant h@xmath12-based ongoing star formation rate of @xmath50.06 - 0.07 m@xmath4yr@xmath10 ] .",

    "subsequent analyses by @xcite and by the authors of the extragalactic distance database ( tully etal .  2009 ; b. jacobs , private communication ) revise this slightly upward to 3.39@xmath00.25 mpc .",
    "we adopt this distance measurement throughout the present work . at 3.39 mpc",
    ", 1  corresponds to 16.4 pc .",
    "as figure  [ figcap1 ] shows , the stellar disk has an irregular morphology and harbors numerous high surface brightness hii  regions and widespread diffuse h@xmath12  emission . despite these characteristics ,",
    "ugca105 has by comparison remained poorly studied in the literature .",
    "the low galactic latitude of the system ( 13.7 ) and the significant foreground extinction values ( e(b@xmath15v)=0.351 mag , or 1.51 mag of extinction in the b - band ; see discussion in footnotes to table  [ t1 ] ) may have conspired to keep this system out of many mainstream local galaxy surveys . as we show in this work , the stellar and gaseous components of ugca105 contain rich morphological and kinematic structure .",
    "this work presents the first detailed study of the neutral gas dynamics of this nearby dwarf galaxy .",
    "hi  spectral line imaging of ugca105 was obtained with the national radio astronomy observatory s _ karl g. jansky very large array _ ( _ jvla _ ) on october 10 , 2011 .",
    "these data were acquired under the auspices of the `` observing for university classes '' program for an upper - level astronomical techniques class at macalester college .",

    "the selection of the band center frequency and the 2 mhz bandwidth was adequate to cleanly separate the milky way and ugca105 emission components .",
    "roughly 40 line - free channels were available at velocities higher than those occupied by the target galaxy , and these were used to fit the underlying continuum with a first - order polynomial and remove it from all channels of the cube .",

    "we conclude that foreground milky way emission does not affect the portions of our cubes that contain hi  spectral line emission from ugca105 .",
    "the final spectral line cube used in this analysis was produced using the aips imagr task with a robust weighting of 0.5 ; this cube was cleaned to the rms level ( 0.003 jybeam@xmath10 ) found in 2 - 3 line - free channels ( purposefully included in the cube and not including emission from ugca105 ) .",

    "this blanked cube is then used as a template to blank the original cube when convolved to the smallest possible circular beam size .",

    "the noise in the final cube is 0.0047 jybeam@xmath10 .",
    "the first two moment maps at 54  resolution ( representing integrated intensity and intensity weighted velocity ) were created from this data cube using the xmom task in aips .",

    "the ordered rotation of the system is prominent as a classical `` butterfly diagram '' moving from southwest to northeast with increasing heliocentric velocity .",
    "the hi  surface brightness is slightly lower in the southwest region of the disk compared to the northeast , although the bulk kinematics are very well defined throughout the disk .",
    "we create the global hi  profile shown in figure  [ figcap4 ] by summing the flux in each of the channel maps shown in figures  [ figcap2 ] and [ figcap3 ] .",
    "as expected from the `` butterfly diagram '' noted above , we see a classic double - horn hi  line profile .",
    "the higher velocity ( northeast ) region of the disk shows a slightly higher integrated flux per channel .",
    "we fit this profile to derive the systemic velocity of the system ( 95@xmath05 kms@xmath10 ) .",
    "we refine this estimate in our kinematic analysis ( see below ) to v@xmath21 = 90.8@xmath02 kms@xmath10 , and show v@xmath21 as a vertical line in figure  [ figcap4 ] .    figure  [ figcap5 ] shows two - dimensional images of the hi  morphology and kinematics .",
    "the moment 0 ( integrated hi  intensity ) images show rich morphological structure in the neutral gas disk .",
    "there is low surface brightness hi  gas in the outer disk , but throughout most of the inner disk the column densities rise above 10@xmath30 @xmath8 at 54  ( 890 pc ) resolution .",
    "there are regions of the inner disk with comparatively low hi  column densities that are roughly the size of the synthesized beam . while these features are suggestive of hi  holes and shells , we await higher spatial resolution imaging in order to study these features in detail .",
    "as expected from the well - behaved channel maps shown in figures  [ figcap2 ] and [ figcap3 ] , the intensity weighted velocity field shown in figure  [ figcap5 ] is very symmetric at this physical resolution . within the inner disk",
    "the isovelocity contours are mostly parallel and the major axis of rotation is well - defined ( position angle @xmath515  east of north ; see more detailed discussion below ) .",
    "the bulk gas kinematics are well - behaved and amenable to detailed rotation curve analysis ( see next subsection ) .    the neutral gas disk ( hi  radius @xmath5 7.2 kpc at the n@xmath6 = 10@xmath7 @xmath8 level ) is roughly twice as large as the stellar disk at the b - band r@xmath9 isophote ( see table  [ t1 ] ) . to allow a straightforward comparison of the stellar and gaseous disk components , we present in figure  [ figcap6](a ) an optical three - color image ( created from _ digitized sky survey _ images ) overlaid with contours of hi  column density .",
    "the high surface brightness stellar disk is cospatial with the dense inner regions of the gaseous disk ( n@xmath6 @xmath31 10@xmath30 @xmath8 ) .",
    "figure  [ figcap1 ] verifies that most of the ongoing star formation in ugca105 is also concentrated within this inner disk ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "figure  [ figcap6](b ) shows the same three color image overlaid with color - coded isovelocity contours .",
    "as expected , the high surface brightness stellar disk is located within the innermost and well - behaved section of the intensity weighted velocity field .",
    "the extent of the well - sampled velocity field compared to the stellar disk , and its coherent rotation at large galactocentric radii , immediately imply that there is a substantial mass component in the outer disk regions .",
    "we explore this in more detail in the next subsections .    at the spatial resolution of these data ( @xmath5890 pc )",
    "we can perform only bulk comparisons of the local hi  surface density with regions of ongoing star formation .",
    "such a first order comparison is shown in figure  [ figcap7 ] , where hi  column density contours at the ( 10 , 12.5 , 15)@xmath210@xmath7 @xmath8 levels are overlaid on zoomed versions of the same 3-color optical and continuum - subtracted h@xmath12  images as shown in figure  [ figcap1 ] .",
    "most , but not all , of the ongoing star formation in ugca105 is coincident with the highest surface density regions of the neutral gas disk",
    ". a detailed comparative study of the local neutral gas surface density and the ongoing star formation in ugca105 would be very fruitful , and we defer such discussion until higher spatial resolution hi  imaging is available .",
    "the proximity of ugca105 , and the well - ordered rotation throughout most of the hi  disk , are conducive to detailed rotation curve analysis . a first order understanding of the bulk kinematics is provided by a simple position velocity ( pv ) cut through the full hi  cube .",
    "by varying the position angle of the pv cut , one can easily identify the direction of maximum velocity gradient in the galaxy ; this offers a simple prior on the kinematic position angle .",
    "similarly , the position angle of zero velocity gradient will be very close to the kinematic minor axis . as shown in figure  [ figcap8 ]",
    ", the pv cut along the major axis ( which is not corrected for inclination ) already shows a flat rotation profile outside of the inner solid body disk .",
    "similarly , the velocity of the kinematic minor axis is in good agreement with the systemic velocity derived above and shows a flat profile in velocity as a function of position .    given these first constraints on the gas kinematics , we next fitted tilted ring models to the velocity field using tools in the _ gipsy _ software package .",
    "in an iterative sequence , we fit the systemic velocity ( v@xmath21 ) , dynamical center position , position angle ( p.a . ) , inclination ( _ i _ ) and rotational velocity for the galaxy as a whole , and for the receding and approaching sides individually . the priors on systemic velocity ( see figures  [ figcap4 ] and [ figcap8 ] ) and on kinematic position angle ( see figure  [ figcap8 ] ) allow one to narrow the starting points in parameter space ( although checks against the same procedures executed without the priors showed no difference in the final best - fit result ) .",
    "we experimented with all available sequences of parameter fitting ( i.e. , fitting each different variable in turn throughout the procedure ) ; the final result is robust against any choice of fitting sequence .",
    "we obtained optimal rotation curve fits to the observed low resolution velocity field by fixing parameters as follows : _",
    "= 55@xmath02 ; p.a .",
    "= 15@xmath02  ( which is in good agreement with the apparent major axis position angle of the stellar disk ; see , e.g. , figure  [ figcap1 ] ) ; v@xmath21 = ( 90.8@xmath02.0 ) kms@xmath10 ; and dynamical center position ( @xmath12,@xmath32 , j2000 ) = ( 5@xmath3314@xmath3413.76@xmath35 , 623453.0 ) .",
    "the resulting curves are shown at both 27  and 54  resolution in figure  [ figcap9 ] ; note that the solid black points use annuli with 27  widths ( i.e. , half of the beam size ) and are only technically independent at every other data point . in figure  [ figcap9 ]",
    "we also show the profiles of kinematic position angle and inclination ( derived using fixed values for v@xmath21 and dynamical center position ) ; there are only minor variations of these parameters with radius .",
    "the rotation curve clearly demonstrates solid - body rotation to @xmath5100  ( 1.5 kpc ) , a more shallow rise between 1.5 and 5.0 kpc , and a flattening at @xmath572 kms@xmath10  to the detection limit in the outer disk ( @xmath57.5 kpc ) . assuming circular orbits , the implied dynamical mass at this outermost radius is ( 9@xmath02)@xmath210@xmath11 m@xmath4 .",
    "this dynamical mass measurement can be directly compared to the total baryonic mass of ugca105 . as noted above ,",
    "our _ jvla _ images reveal a total hi  mass of ( 4.3@xmath00.5)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 . given the low mass of ugca105 , it is likely to be a metal - poor system ( see , e.g. , the mass - metallicity relationship presented by tremonti etal .  2004 ) whose molecular content is difficult to measure observationally . while @xcite do find a marginal detection of co in ugca105 ( i@xmath36 = ( 0.61@xmath00.16 ) kkms@xmath10 )",
    ", a direct measurement of the molecular mass in this galaxy is not currently available .",
    "thus , following @xcite , we include a 35% correction for helium and molecular material and adopt ( 5.9@xmath00.7)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4  as the total gas mass ( m@xmath37 ) of ugca105 .",
    "our tilted ring analysis also allows us to examine the radial behavior of hi  mass density per unit area throughout the gas disk .",
    "we again used the _ gipsy _ software package to integrate the hi  flux per unit area , in concentric rings separated by the beam widths , after correcting for inclination and the galaxy s major axis position angle ( see figure  [ figcap9 ] and discussion above ) .",
    "the resulting plot , shown in figure  [ figcap10 ] , demonstrates that the innermost few hundred pc of the hi  disk contains significantly less neutral gas per unit area than the regions further out in the disk ; this could be tantalizing though marginal evidence for a molecular region in the inner disk ( indeed , the marginal co detection by leroy etal .",
    "2005 is in close proximity to the dynamical center position ) .",
    "the highest mass surface densities are located between @xmath512 kpc from the dynamical center .",
    "the infrared luminosity of ugca105 is estimated using the 2mass broadband infrared photometry presented in the 2mass extended source catalog @xcite .",
    "the total j , h , and k@xmath38  magnitudes are 12.274@xmath00.030 , 11.510@xmath00.037 , and 11.364@xmath00.052 , respectively .",
    "we assume a negligible difference between k and k@xmath38  magnitudes and adopt l@xmath393.33 @xcite .",
    "the total k - band luminosity of ugca105 is found to be l@xmath40 @xmath57.8@xmath210@xmath41 l@xmath4 after correcting for milky way extinction .    to derive the mass of the stellar component",
    ", we apply the techniques discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we use the models presented in @xcite , which take as input the observed color and luminosity of a stellar population .",
    "the models allow one to estimate a stellar mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) assuming a range of metallicities , initial mass functions , and galaxy evolution properties . given the substantial milky way foreground screen , the near - infrared colors are optimal ; further , these colors are less affected by recent or ongoing star formation within ugca105 than are optical colors . applying the model m / l ratios and the observed k - band luminosity , we can then estimate the stellar mass of ugca105 . using this approach",
    "we find that the underlying stellar mass in ugca105 is m@xmath42 @xmath22 ( 1.8@xmath00.8)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "the sum of the luminous baryons ( gas and stars ) in ugca105 is estimated to be m@xmath43 @xmath44 8@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 . at the last measured point of the hi  rotation curve ( see figure  [ figcap9 ] ) , the implied interior dynamical mass is @xmath59@xmath210@xmath11 m@xmath4 .",
    "while we are sensitive to neither the molecular component of the ism nor to the cool dust component with the present observations , recent investigations have shown that these components are not substantial mass reservoirs in the interstellar media of low - mass galaxies ( see , e.g. , leroy etal .",
