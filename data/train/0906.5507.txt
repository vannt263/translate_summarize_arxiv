    "the extinction corrected spectra of the hot he - stars are in good agreement with pure rayleigh jeans continuum spectra .",
    "the intrinsic spectra of all other sources show residual dust continuum emission and/or grain mantel absorption features .",
    "since it is unlikely that foreground extinction patches are exclusively associated with the extended bright gc mir sources we interpreted both facts as evidence that a significant amount of the absorption takes place within the central parsec of the galactic center and is most likely associated with the circum - stellar material in which the individual sources are embedded .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to use the 4.55 - 4.80@xmath0 m m - band spectra for several bright sources in the central cluster in order to distinguish between line of sight and possible source intrinsic absorption .",
    "prominent line features in the m - band spectrum are the pf@xmath12 hydrogen recombination line and absorption lines from gaseous and solid co.    cold gaseous co produces the typical vibration - rotation band structure of a diatomic molecule , two broad envelopes of absorption separated by a small gap at 4.666@xmath0 m ( the @xmath13 band center ; allamandola 1984 ) .",

    "[ icegas ] ) .",
    "we see indications for strong residual co gaseous absorptions towards extended infrared excess sources and weak residual absorptions toward more compact and hot stellar sources in the galactic center .",
    "these two facts support the presence of source intrinsic co absorption associated with individual sources at the galactic center .    with large apertures in the range of 20  to 70 ",
    "as used by moneti , cernicharo & pardo ( 2001 ) the iso sws / lws measurements are dominated by the absorption in the cold ism along the line of sight against the strong thermal emission of the extended sgra  west source , like the mini - spiral and the inner extensions of the circum nuclear ring ( cnd ) .",
    "+ while the contribution of compact absorption sources at the galactic center is included in apertures of these sizes , their beam filling is small with respect to the almost totally beam filling extended source components .",
    "this situation changes , however , if we go to apertures as small as the isaac slit - width of only 0.6  . in fig.[bild ] we show the geometry that is relevant to understand the mir absorption line measurements towards sources in the galactic center . here",
    "the flux density contribution of the compact dust emitting sources located at the galactic center becomes increasingly dominant and the contribution of the much more extended flux density contributors is strongly diminished .",
    "in addition to the absorption due to the cold material along the line of sight towards the galactic center , the source intrinsic absorptions now become increasingly important . in the case of the present sources",
    "the absorption occurs within the circumstellar gas and dust shell against a number of background sources : 1 ) the stellar emission , 2 ) the thermal emission of the mini - spiral background , 3 ) and against a combination of the strong contribution of scattered light and thermal emission of the circumstellar shell itself .      in the present section we estimate the line of sight foreground extinction due to co ice and gas absorption ( the latter , based on @xmath5co gas line measurements ) .",
    "after comparison with the absorption towards an intrinsically dust and molecular gas free gc source the residual co absorption toward other gc sources in the field can then be attributed to the source intrinsic extinction under the assumption that the foreground extinction does not vary on scales of about 20 \" . in the following",
    ", the optical depth is calculated via @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the line and continuum intensity at a given wavelength .",
    "the continuum level is determined for all sources as the best fitting straight line through the intensities at wavelengths less than 4.56@xmath0 m ( except for irs16c where we took wavelengths between 4.56 and 4.58 micron because the spectrum is not reliable at shorter wavelengths ) , larger than 4.80@xmath0 m , and through a 0.01@xmath0 m wide interval centered at 4.73@xmath0 m , i.e. between the @xmath4co and @xmath5co gas absorption .      in order to calibrate the co ice we selected irs2l as a calibration source .",
    "indeed , irs2l has been identified as a b - type star ( clnet et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is thus free of co bandhead absorption and has a relatively flat spectrum in the m - band . its spectrum shows a high signal to noise and well pronounced ice absorption with only weak traces of co - gas absorption .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that the overall absorption towards irs  2l is dominated by line of sight ice - absorption since this source is located close but not inside the mini - spiral area and is clearly not behind the cnd material .",
    "for all these reasons , the line shape of the irs2l spectrum can be used as a template for the foreground ice absorption towards all other sources in the field and to correct for the contribution of this ice - feature ( see figs .",
    "[ coolstars ] and [ icegas]a ) . in the following , we assume that the foreground co ice absorption has the shape of the template spectrum but we allow for a small variation in the amount of this absorption from source to source . + on the other hand , the absorption trough towards short wavelengths in the irs2l spectrum is indicative of a possible contribution of xcn absorption ( see section [ xcn ] and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , this spectrum is also well suited to calibrate a possible xcn line of sight absorption .",
    "+ to derive the co ice absorption spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ icegas]a , we smoothed the irs  2l spectrum and got rid , in this way , of the features not belonging to the co ice feature , which are the pf@xmath27 and the prominent feature between the p- and r- branches ( at about 4.67 @xmath0 ) of the co gas feature ; we then normalised the continuum to one .",
    "+ the individual source spectra were divided by the resulting ice foreground absorption spectrum diluted by an additional adjustable continuum contribution ( which accounts for a possible variation in the amount of absorption ) , with the condition that the spectral region between the p- and r - branches of the remaining gaseous absorption should be at the same flux density level as the continuum around 4.73@xmath0 m and 4.80@xmath0 m wavelength .",
    "+ in this process , we assumed that the spectral region centered at a wavelength of 4.73@xmath0 m and 4.80@xmath0 m",
    "( i.e. between the @xmath4co and @xmath5co and longward of the @xmath5co absorption features ) is a continuum and therefore , must be at the same level as the continuum region longward of the @xmath5co absorption feature in the final corrected spectra as it is the case in the theoretical co spectrum ( see figs .",
    "[ cotheofig ] and [ icegas]b ) .",
    "this procedure is feasible since both the co ice absorption and the center of the co gas absorption are well separated from each other ( by about a fwhm of the co ice absorption feature ) .",
    "+ the resulting spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ extcorr ] .",
    "under these conditions we find a mean value of the diluting continuum of about 4  jy for all the sources in the field , including the calibrator source irs  2l ( the values of the diluting continuum toward individual sources are shown in tab.[dilution ] ) .",
    "this means that the mean foreground solid co extinction spectrum is obtained by shifting the template spectrum shown in fig.4a by 4  jy .",
    "then , the continuum is at 5  jy ( 4 + 1  jy ) and the minimum of the absorption is at about 4.25  jy ( 4 + 0.25  jy ) . defining the `` absorption strength '' as being the ratio between the continuum intensity and the minimum absorption intensity ( i.e ; i@xmath28/i@xmath29 ) ,",
    "the solid co absorption strength is about 1.2 ( i.e. 5/4.26@xmath171.2 ) , while the one of the template is of 3.8 ( 1/0.26@xmath173.8 ) .",
    "this means that about 1/3 of the ice template absorption strength is due to foreground material along the line of sight which corresponds to an optical depth of @xmath30@xmath170.1 - 0.2 ( @xmath30=-ln(i@xmath29/i@xmath28 ) ) . for residual ice - absorption",
    "see comments in section [ section : notes ] . allowing for larger amounts of foreground absorption leads to an over - correction of the spectral region between the co p- and r - branches .",
    "+ please notice that a dilution was also needed in the case of the irs  2l spectrum ( which was used to derive the template spectrum ) because gaseous co and pf@xmath27 features are also present in this spectrum even though they are not very prominent .",
    "thus , correcting this spectrum for the foreground solid co extinction should also take into account that the region between the p- and r- branches of the gaseous co feature and the regions between the @xmath4co and @xmath5co and longward of the @xmath5co absorption features are part of the continuum .",

    "from the fact that on average about one third of the ice - template depth ( fig.[icegas]a ) absorption is due to foreground material in order to reproduce the line shape of the co gaseous absorption shown in fig.[cotheofig ] , we derive an optical depth of the foreground solid co absorption of @xmath30@xmath170.1 - 0.2 . with @xmath32@xmath176 - 7  @xmath33@xmath170.016@xmath0 m ( see fig.[icegas ] ) we obtain n(co)@xmath177@xmath3410@xmath37cm@xmath7 ( see tab .

    "low temperatures ( burgh , france & mccandliss , 2007 ) and the relevance of hydrogenation processes on grain surfaces ( oneill , viti & williams , 2002 , viti , williams & oneill , 2000 ) indicate that in fact a very large portion of co may be frozen out in diffuse and translucent clouds .",
    "this indicates that a substantial fraction of the extinction is caused by the dust associated with the corresponding more volatile h@xmath39 gas that remains in the gas phase ( see e.g. duley 1974 , lee 1972 , 1975 ) .",

    "this indicates that the gaseous co absorption in dense molecular clouds can also account for the foreground extinction to the galactic center and that it can be comparable to the amount of extinction traced by the deep co ice absorption features in diffuse clouds . in chapter [ massestim ]",

    "therefore , the absorption line at 0 km / s could potentially be attributed to the gas and dust shell it is embedded in .    for irs  1 the strong absorption at about 20  km /",
    "s reported by geballe , baas & wade ( 1989 ) falls close to the radial velocity of the source and could be an intrinsic absorption feature .",
