    "the quantum hall effect represents a state of matter in which an insulating , two - dimensional sample permits perfect conductance along its edges @xcite .",
    "this is an intriguing physical situation with many potential applications , but it can only be realized at low temperatures and in a high magnetic field . since its discovery in 1980 ,",
    "researchers have searched for this perfect conductance in systems which do not have the constraints of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "twenty five years later , it was suggested that a similar situation could be realized using materials with strong spin - orbit splitting of the states without the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the corresponding state is called the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) and it was experimentally confirmed in 2007 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the quantum hall effect , the qshe supports counter - propagating states on each sample edge but the propagation direction is linked to the electron spin .",
    "back - scattering is thus not permitted and , again , perfect one - dimensional transport is observed .",
    "while the qshe corresponds to a two - dimensional system with one - dimensional edge states , its three - dimensional analogues are called topological insulators @xcite .",
    "these materials are bulk band insulators but they support metallic surface states .",
    "the existence of such states is required by the bulk band structure , in contrast to the more coincidental and fragile metallic surface states frequently encountered on semiconductor surfaces @xcite . the first bulk topological insulator found",
    "experimentally was obtained by doping the semimetal bi with sb to obtain bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , a material with a very small band gap , but stable surface states that , not surprisingly , strongly resemble those on the pure bi surface @xcite . as a material",
    ", bi@xmath2sb@xmath3 has several disadvantages for potential applications : its random nature ( implying poor crystal quality ) , the very small bulk band gap of less than 30  mev which restricts possible applications to low temperatures , and the rather complicated electronic structure of its ( 111 ) surface .",
    "later , other topological insulators were discovered such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these materials are ordered alloys , have a gap size of @xmath5  mev , and their surface electronic structure consists of a single , metallic state with a dirac cone - like dispersion .    the surface states on a three - dimensional topological insulator show strong similarity to the edge states of the qshe .",
    "they are completely non - degenerate with respect to spin , except at some symmetry - protected points , and the spin texture of the dirac cone shows a well - defined chirality of the in - plane spin polarisation @xcite .",
    "consequently , the states are also immune to back - scattering @xcite .",
    "strictly spoken , however , this restriction applies to backscattering only , with near back - scattering processes being unlikely but allowed .",
    "the situation on these surfaces is thus very similar to that for conventional surface states with strong rashba - type spin - orbit splitting @xcite and virtually the same as for the surface states on the pure semimetal bi @xcite .",
    "recently , the binary alloys bi@xmath0se@xmath1  and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite have been used as prototype topological insulators in experiments because of their simple electronic structure with a single dirac cone at the surface , and because of practical matters such as ease of crystal fabrication and surface preparation .",
    "the latter is related to the layered structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bzcrystal](a ) , that is formed of quintuple layers of covalently bonded bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ,  separated by van der waals gaps .",
    "this crystal structure allows samples to be easily cleaved in vacuum thus exposing a clean surface .",
    "the topological character of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  is derived from a parity inversion at the @xmath6 point of the bulk band structure @xcite . to see this ,",
    "consider the so - called time - reversal invariant momenta ( trims ) @xmath7 in the bulk brillouin zone ( bz ) , as defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a reciprocal lattice vector @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bzcrystal](b ) ) . for each trim , it is possible to define a parity invariant @xmath10 that accounts for the parity of the occupied bands by taking the product of the parity eigenvalues of all ( spin degenerate ) bands at the trim . in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , these parity invariants are all @xmath11 , except for the one corresponding to the bulk @xmath6 point which is @xmath12 @xcite . taking the product of the parity invariants at all 8 bulk trims",
    ", one thus obtains again @xmath12 and this guarantees the bulk material to be a strong topological insulator .",
    "these parity invariants are then projected onto the surface trims ( defined in an analogous way ) , and result in the so - called surface fermion parity . for the hexagonal surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) of bi@xmath0se@xmath1(111 ) , the @xmath13 surface trim thus obtains a surface fermion parity of @xmath12 while the @xmath14 trim has @xmath11 .",
    "the surface electronic structure is then closely related to these projected parity eigenvalues , with a change in surface fermion parity requiring an odd number of fermi level crossings between the trims and , even more stringently , a surface fermion parity eigenvalue of @xmath12 requiring the surface trim to be enclosed by an odd number of closed fermi contours @xcite .",
    "consistent with this , the @xmath13 point of bi@xmath0se@xmath1   is enclosed by a single , circular fermi contour .",
    "se@xmath1  and interlayer distances as determined by x - ray diffraction .",
    "three primitive lattice vectors are indicated in red while in green the quintuple layer is highlighted .",

    "width=576 ]    already in the first experimental studies of the topological surface states of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , a peculiar ageing effect was reported in that the observed electronic states gradually move to higher binding energies @xcite .",
    "this effect was earlier observed in the similar compound bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite and ascribed to band bending induced by a slow geometrical relaxation of the van der waals gap between the quintuple layers of the structure .",
    "it turns out that this ageing effect brings about a number of interesting and controversial spectroscopic observations that will be discussed in this paper .    the ageing - induced band bending shifts the observed states to higher binding energies such that the minimum of the bulk conduction band eventually becomes observable , even for initially p - doped samples @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectroscopic appearance of the states near the conduction band changes .",
    "first , a distinct rim around the bottom of the conduction band becomes observable @xcite , then this rim develops into a well - separated state , and eventually it shows a splitting that is strongly reminiscent of a rashba - type spin - orbit splitting @xcite of two dimensional states , and is spectroscopically quite similar to rashba - split surface states on surfaces involving heavy elements such as au or bi @xcite .",
    "similar spectroscopic features were observed for surfaces which were exposed to magnetic atoms @xcite , rest gas in the vacuum @xcite , carbon monoxide @xcite , water @xcite and alkali atoms @xcite .    the observed rim around the conduction band was explained in terms of the formation of a quantum well state ( or two - dimensional electron gas ) in the quantum well which is formed because of the strong downward bending of the conduction band at the surface @xcite .",
    "the rashba - type splitting is a consequence of this quantum well state being placed in a strong electric field near the surface @xcite .",
    "however , alternative explanations have also been given .",
    "the rashba - split states have been discussed in terms of being additional , but topologically trivial , surface states whose presence becomes necessary because of the strong downward band bending @xcite .",
    "based on first principles calculations , it has also been suggested that the additional states could be caused by the expansion of near - surface van der waals gaps due to the intercalation of adsorbates @xcite . while these calculations show that an increase in near - surface van der waals gaps causes the electronic structure to become more two - dimensional , these predictions fail to explain all of the observed changes to the electronic structure as will be discussed in more detail below .    in the present paper",
    "we report arpes results from clean bi@xmath0se@xmath1  surfaces , using crystals with different bulk doping .",
    "we also discuss carbon monoxide adsorption on ca - doped samples .",
    "special emphasis is given to the band - bending induced states in the region of the conduction band .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we start with a brief review of the arpes technique and discuss how states of different character ( bulk , surface , two - dimensional quantum well ) are identified in arpes spectra .",
    "we then describe the experimental and theoretical tools used in this paper .",
    "this is followed by a section presenting and discussing the results as well as a brief conclusion .",
    "even though the arpes technique is well known and established ( for reviews and books see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is useful to note a few details that will be exploited in the experimental investigation presented in the following part .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the character of the electronic states that we can expect to detect at or near a surface .",
    "a schematic summary is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : near_surface_states ] .",
    "bulk bloch states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : near_surface_states](a ) ) can always be matched to an exponentially decaying tail outside the surface by adjusting the phase between the incoming and reflected wave inside the solid and the amplitude of the evanescent wave outside .",
    "the bulk electronic structure is thus not significantly modified by the introduction of the surface and bulk states . within ( projected ) band gaps , such as near the bz boundary in the case of a nearly free electron model , new solutions to the bulk schrdinger equation can exist .",
    "these give real energy eigenvalues , but only if a complex @xmath15 wave vector is chosen .",
    "clearly , such solutions can not be normalized inside the bulk but at the surface it is in some cases also possible to match them to an exponentially decaying wave function in the vacuum .",
    "this gives rise to genuine surface states , a phenomenon that has been known for a long time @xcite and is textbook material @xcite . in the present context",
    ", it is worthwhile pointing out that the characteristic exponential decay length @xmath16 into the bulk depends on the energy difference @xmath17 between the surface state solution and the bulk states , with the order of magnitude given by @xmath18 . for a mid - gap state in a topological insulator",
    ", this would be quite small , in the order of 1  nm but it increases as the state approaches the projected bulk states .",
    "finally , bulk states can be localized close to the surface due to quantum - confinement , either by band bending near the surface ( or interface ) of a semiconductor , as routinely realized in semiconductor devices but also found at pristine surfaces @xcite , or in thin metal films on semiconductors or insulators @xcite . in the case of a semiconductor ,",
    "the situation is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : near_surface_states](c ) .",
    "the band bending leads to a quantisation of the conduction band states near the surface .",
    "the wave function for the lowest quantum well state ( qws ) is schematically shown .",
    "on the mesoscopic scale , it is the solution of the schrdinger equation obtained for a potential well of this shape . on a microscopic scale",
    "the wave function retains its original bloch character @xcite . for our purpose ,",
    "it is worth noticing that the quantum confinement turns the state from three - dimensional to two - dimensional in the sense that there is no dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the state is also confined to a region close to the surface but its decay away from the surface is not exponential and it typically penetrates much deeper into the material than a genuine surface state .",
    "indeed , the physics of these quantum - confined states is very different to that of a surface states as they are directly derived from bulk states by merely restricting the number of allowed @xmath19 values .    .",
    "the bloch wave inside the crystal can always be matched to an exponentially decaying tail outside the crystal .",
    "( b ) ( projected ) bulk band gaps can give rise to new bloch states with a complex wave number @xmath15 , i.e. an exponential growth in one direction .",
    "in some cases , these exponentially increasing solutions can also be matched to an exponential tail outside the surface , giving rise to a surface state .",
    "( c ) left : in a semiconductor , a strong downward bending of the conduction band can lead to the quantisation of the conduction band states near the surface .",
    "the envelope wave function of the lowest state ( solid line ) has no node and the microscopic state still has bloch - wave character ( dashed line ) .",
    "right : in a band structure picture , this quantisation reduces the permitted @xmath19-values in a band ( only considered for the lower band ) .",
    "the states thus loose their three dimensional dispersion and become two - dimensional .",
    "the near - surface bloch wave looks similar to that of the parent bulk state.,width=432 ]    when considering arpes from the above states , it is useful to first establish the purely kinematic conditions for the state s observation .",
    "the introduction of the surface breaks the translational periodicity of the crystal in the @xmath20 direction and the wave vector in that direction @xmath19 is thus no longer well - defined .",
    "the components of the wave vector parallel to the surface ( @xmath21 ) , on the other hand , are still well defined and must be conserved in the photoemission process .",
    "they are thus obtained from the photoemission angle with respect to the normal of the sample and the kinetic energy of the photoelectron . in order to map the photoemission intensity on the hemisphere over the sample s surface , it is possible to implement an azimuthal scan ( rotating the sample around the surface normal direction ) for every polar angle considered . in today",
    "s arpes setups , the electron analyzer often contains a two - dimensional detector that can simultaneously image the energy dispersion of the electrons and the angular dispersion in one direction ( see fig . [",
    "fig : kxky ] ) . in this case",
    ", it is useful to consider the dispersion along two polar angles ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , along orthogonal directions as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kxky](d ) . in this configuration , the relation between the angles and @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the kinetic energy of the photoemitted electron .",

    "even if we ignore this fundamental problem for the time being , it would not be possible to recover @xmath19 inside the sample from the value measured outside due to the potential change at the surface that leads to a refraction effect at the surface barrier @xcite . despite these difficulties ,",
    "it is often still possible to recover @xmath19 of the initial state from the photoemission spectra , provided that the dispersion of the final states is known .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : photoemission_res](a ) . as the photon energy",
    "is changed , different initial state energies and @xmath19 values can be probed and the bulk state in question will appear as a peak at different binding energies in the spectrum , depending on the photon energy used .",
    "the state s binding energy at high symmetry points ( @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the one - dimensional lattice constant perpendicular to the surface ) can easily be read from the spectra , but the detailed dispersion of the state can only be recovered if the final state dispersion is known .    even if this is not the case , it is often possible to obtain a good approximation of the entire dispersion by assuming final states of a simple form , for example free electron final states . in this case",
    "it is possible to calculate @xmath19 plus or minus a reciprocal lattice vector as a function of the emission angle @xmath22 and the inner potential @xmath31 using @xmath32 the inner potential @xmath31 can be determined iteratively by requiring the resulting @xmath19 to be consistent with the binding energy extrema at symmetry points .    the problem that @xmath19 is not well - defined anymore can not be neglected . in particular , the finite escape depth of the photoelectron leads to a @xmath19 broadening @xmath33 .",
    "as the state disperses in the @xmath19 direction , this also leads to an energy broadening @xmath34 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : photoemission_res](a ) .",
    "this problem is absent for photoemission from surface states and quantum - confined states , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photoemission_res](b ) and ( c ) , respectively ( again , the quantum confinement has only been introduced for the lowest band ) . strictly spoken ,",
    "neither the surface state nor the quantum confined state have a well - defined @xmath19 because they are localized in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "this is usually a much more severe restriction for the more strongly confined surface states than for the deeply penetrating qws . in neither case",
    "does the wave function loose its periodicity perpendicular to the surface completely and the bloch wave character in the @xmath20 direction is partly retained .",
    "thus , the markers in the figure symbolize the @xmath19 value the state is derived from and the horizontal lines symbolize that @xmath19 is not defined anymore . in any case",
    ", the absence of a dispersion with @xmath19 implies directly that a @xmath19 broadening does not result in an energy broadening in the photoemission spectra , unlike the case for the bulk states .",
    "this implies that it is often easier to determine a bulk band structure in the presence of quantum confinement than in its absence @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 is ill - defined also implies that surface states and qws can be observed not only for one photon energy but for a broad range of photon energies .     and @xmath35 are the fermi and vacuum level , respectively .",
    "( a ) bulk states measured with different photon energies appear at different binding energies in the spectrum , i.e. they show dispersion .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 is not well - defined leads to a broadening @xmath33 that is then reflected in an energy broadening @xmath34 of the observed peaks .",
    "( b ) quantum well states are derived from restricting the possible @xmath19 values in a structure ( green markers , only shown for the lowest band ) but the @xmath19 broadening ( green lines ) implies that they can be observed for a range of photon energies . as they do not show dispersion , this will not lead to an energy broadening .",
    "similar arguments hold for surface states ( c ) .",
    ", width=384 ]    with this we come to the dynamic properties of the photoemission from bulk states , surface states and qws , and we consider the photoemission intensity we can expect to measure .",
    "even if we assume perfect angular and energy resolution in the experiment , the complete expression is rather complicated @xcite .",
    "one obtains : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the three - dimensional wave vectors for the initial and final state in the solid , @xmath39 is the wave vector for the free electron outside the solid , @xmath40 is the photon energy , @xmath41 is the fermi distribution , @xmath42 is the work function , @xmath43 is the hole spectral function and @xmath44 is a lorentzian distribution to account for the real - space damping of the outgoing electron wave , with @xmath45 being the perpendicular wave vector for the un - damped final state wave . @xmath46",
    "is the matrix element for the photoemission process .",
    "the integration is over all possible perpendicular wave vector components @xmath47 . for qws or surface states",
    ", this integration becomes irrelevant .",
    "the quantity of most interest is often the spectral function @xmath48 . in simple terms , this is a measure of finding an electron with a certain energy and crystal momentum , i.e. an image of the band structure , including lifetime broadening effects . for two - dimensional systems such as surface states and qws ,",
    "the photoemission intensity is directly proportional to @xmath43 , as no final state broadening has to be considered . for a detailed further analysis",
    "it is only necessary to assume that the matrix element does not depend strongly on the binding energy or wave vector .    in the present context",
    ", the matrix element depends rather strongly on the photon energy and this dependence contains valuable information on the nature of the observed states .",
    "this is evident when considering figs .",
    "[ fig : near_surface_states ] and [ fig : photoemission_res ] . for bulk states ,",
    "no significant change in the photoemission intensity is expected as the photon energy is varied ( assuming a gap - free final state ) .",
    "a different photon energy will merely lead to emission from a bulk state around a different @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photoemission_res](a ) ) . for surface states and qws ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photoemission_res ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) this is not so : both lack a well - defined @xmath19 but the wave functions still have a remaining bloch character perpendicular to the surface . for the qws ,",
    "this bloch character is very similar to the parent bulk states and for the surface state it is similar to the bands near the bz boundary at @xmath49 ( in this particular case ) .",
    "thus , a resonant enhancement in the photoemission intensity of such states is expected for photon energies that would have lead to emission from the parent bulk states .",
    "this is indeed observed in many cases @xcite and it will be used in the following discussion .",
    "samples grown from stoichiometric mixutures are known to be highly @xmath50-doped due to presence of defects in the bulk and mainly charged se vacancies @xcite . for this reason two different bi@xmath0se@xmath1  crystals were used during the experiments . the first batch of crystals , named as intrinsic ,",

    "these are also visible fig .",

    "the reason for this is likely the different microscopic wave functions of the vb and cb states .",
    "it is well - known that the rashba splitting of extended states is largely an atomic effect and a detailed understanding of the size @xcite and even the sign @xcite of the splitting requires a knowledge of the atomic wave function near the nuclei .",
    "indeed , the different wave function character is already evident from the state s dispersion near @xmath13 where the vb states are much flatter and a small rashba splitting , being an offset in @xmath61 , would be hard to detect .",
    "the fermi surface map presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cofs ] demonstrates that the qws and the topological state undergo an similar hexagonal warping .",
    "both show weaker warping occurring at smaller momentum , as described by the model in @xcite .",
    "while the inner branch of the qws leads to a circular fermi contour , the outer one appears hexagonal .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the dosing of h@xmath0o leads to similar effects as observed for co @xcite .",
    "the band bending is similar but its origin has been ascribed to a chemical reaction occurring at the surface that extracts se atoms , leaving positively charged vacancies . in the case of co adsorption",
    ", such a reaction appears unlikely .",
    "co is a strongly bonded molecule ( triple - bond ) , and it can only be dissociated by adsorption on reactive transition metal surfaces .",
    "the adsorption of co as a molecular species is consistent with the behaviour of the surface electronic structure upon mild annealing of the sample ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cofs ] ( d ) ) .",
    "when we heat the sample to 250  k , the band bending and rashba - splitting is reduced , consistent with a partial desorption of co. note that the thermal desorption of co from bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has not yet been studied in any detail , and it is not clear if the adsorption can be completely reversed by thermal desorption .",
    "a recent theoretical study of molecular adsorption of other species on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 suggests that this might not be the case due to preferential and strong bonding to defect sites on the surface @xcite .",
    "we now return to possible alternative explanations of the phenomena discussed here .",
    "different interpretations have been proposed , in particular to explain the rashba - split states in the cb region but also for the m - shaped states in the vb region .",
    "_ show that states of similar appearance can be found in a slab calculation of the electronic structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  when the energies of the states near the surface are rigidly shifted @xcite .",
    "such a procedure can be viewed as a crude implementation of a band bending and is thus not dissimilar to the picture given here .",
    "in fact , it is otherwise very difficult to accurately account for the band bending in a supercell - type density functional theory calculation .",
    "the reason is that the the slab used in such a calculation usually contains a limited number of layers , typically between 12 quintuple layers ( 114  )  @xcite and 25 quintuple layers ( 240  )  @xcite .",
    "band bending effects that extend to @xmath82    into the sample @xcite , are thus difficult to describe accurately with the limited slab size .    an alternative scenario is discussed in refs .",
    "there it is argued that spectroscopic changes similar to those reported here could be caused by an increase in the van der waals gap(s ) between the near - surface quintuple layers .",
    "this increase of van der waals gap sizes could be caused by the intercalation of adsorbed atoms or molecules .",
    "strongly increased distances between quintuple layers ( between 10% and 40% ) are predicted to lead to two major changes in the electronic structure : the appearance of rashba - split states that are split - off the conduction band minimum and m - shaped states in the projected band gap below the valence band maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bzcrystal](c ) )",
    ". it is indeed plausible that at least alkali atoms can be intercalated into the van der waals gap in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , as this is a well - known phenomenon for bulk crystals @xcite , but for molecules such as co intercalation appears unlikely . on the other hand ,",
    "this proposed mechanism fails to explain a key experimental observation ; a calculation with an increased interlayer spacing predicts a single m - shaped state in the valence band region whereas several such states are observed experimentally .",
    "this shortcoming can probably be improved by allowing for several van der waals interlayer spacings to relax @xcite . a more important issue than the number the theoretically predicted m - shaped states is that their energy position of does not agree with the experimental result . in the calculation ,",
    "the m - shaped states are found in the projected band gap below the top of the valence band at @xmath13 .",
    "these states are thus genuine new surface states . in the experiment ,",
    "on the other hand , the m - shaped states are found within the region of the projected valence band , with the possible exception of the state at highest binding energy .",
    "this is directly evident from comparing the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : timedep ] and [ fig : coescan ] . these states ,",
    "therefore , can not be surface states , but must be qws derived from the bulk states .",
    "another interesting point is that the calculated surface electronic structure is only significantly modified for rather large changes in the van der waals interlayer spacing , on the order of 10  % or more .",
    "experimentally , the intercalation - induced changes are often found to be rather small .",
    "the intercalation of substantial amounts of copper into bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , for example , leads to a change of the van der waals gap of only 3% @xcite .",
    "currently , little is known about intercalation - induced changes of the near - surface structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , but such changes could be determined by surface x - ray diffraction , at least in principle .",
    "the band bending picture for the explanation of the m - shaped states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has been questioned by recent results for the similar compound bi@xmath83te@xmath1 @xcite . in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , similar m - shaped and distinct states in the valence band region are found upon exposing the sample to air or @xmath84 , but the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that band bending can not be the origin of these structures for two reasons : first , the structure is m - shaped and thus the effective mass changes from electron - like in the centre to hole - like on the wings .",
    "thus , it is impossible for the entire state to be confined .",
    "second , the band bending for confining the states would have to be larger than the total band width , which the authors determine to be around 300  mev .",
    "we believe these arguments are invalid .",
    "concerning the first argument , the shape of the state in @xmath85 is not relevant for the confinement that takes place in the @xmath20 direction perpendicular to the surface . along @xmath19 ,",
    "the most advanced gw - calculations show no large dispersion of the band , and it is not clear if it is hole - like or electron - like @xcite .",
    "concerning the second argument , the relevant bandwidth is also that in @xmath19 , not in @xmath85 . again , gw - theory predicts the width of the upper valence band to be very small @xcite , and even the band structure calculation shown in the supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite appears to give a large band width only because two bands are involved . finally , it is not strictly necessary to have a band bending that exceeds the total band width in order to confine the valence band states . in a situation with a projected band gap below the valence band",
    ", the states with the lowest energy can already be confined by a much smaller band bending .",
    "a band bending larger than the total width is only required if the entire band is to be quantised .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented arpes results for clean and adsorbate - covered bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "different bulk dopings were studied . for carbon monoxide or rest gas adsorption , a strong downward bending of the near - surface bands was observed .",
    "this was found to lead to new spectral features in the energy region of both the valence band and the conduction band .",
    "these changes were explained by a confinement of the states and the formation of quantum well states .",
    "this interpretation is supported by simple calculations of the band bending effects and by photon energy - dependent arpes measurements that show how the band dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the surface is lost and non - dispersing , sharp states appear within the energy regions of the projected bulk bands . for strong band bending , the conduction band quantum well states are strongly rashba split .",
