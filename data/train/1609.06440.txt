    "massive stars ( @xmath58 m@xmath6 ) play a crucial role in the evolution of their host galaxies , but their exact formation and evolution mechanisms are still under debate @xcite .",
    "it is not yet understood whether the formation of massive stars is only a scaled - up version of birth process of low mass stars , or is it a completely different process .",
    "one can find more details about the current theoretical scenarios of massive star formation in the recent reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , a collision between two molecular clouds followed by a strong shock compression of gas is considered as a probable formation mechanism of massive stars @xcite . @xcite",
    "numerically found that the head - on collision between two non - identical molecular clouds can trigger the formation of massive stars , and such process could also form a broken bubble - like structure . in a detailed study of rcw 120 star - forming region using the molecular line data , @xcite reported that the collision between two nearby molecular clouds has triggered the formation of an o star in rcw 120 in a short time scale .",
    "however , observational evidences for the formation of o stars via a collision between two molecular clouds are still very rare .",
    "massive stars can significantly influence the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) through their energetics such as ionizing radiation , stellar winds , and radiation pressure .",
    "they have an ability to help in accumulation of surrounding materials ( i.e. , positive feedback ) and/or to disperse matter into the ism .",
    "furthermore , they can also affect the star formation positively and negatively @xcite .",
    "the positive feedback of massive stars can trigger the birth of a new generation of stars including young massive star(s ) .",
    "more details about the various processes of triggered star formation can be found in the review article by @xcite .",
    "however , the feedback processes of massive stars are not yet well understood , and the direct observational proof of triggered star formation by massive stars is rare .",
    "but the influence of massive stars on their surroundings can be studied with several other observational signatures ( like h ii region , wind - blown or radiation driven galactic bubble , etc . ) .",
    "recently , _ spitzer _",
    "observations have revealed thousands of ring / shell / bubble - like structures in the 8 @xmath7 m images @xcite , and many of them often enclose the hii regions .",
    "hence , the bubbles associated with hii regions are potential targets to probe the physical processes governing the interaction and feedback effect of massive stars on their surroundings .",
    "additionally , these sites are often grouped with the infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) and young stellar clusters , which also allow to understand the formation and evolution of these stellar clusters .    in this paper , we present a multi - wavelength study of such a mid - infrared ( mir ) bubble , n37 ( @xmath8 25@xmath9.292 , @xmath10 0@xmath9.293 ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite analyzed the photometry and spectroscopy of stars in the direction of the hii region , rcw 173 , and found that most of the stars in the field are reddened b - type stars .",
    "they also identified a star a805 ( g025.2465 + 00.3011 ) having spectral type of o7ii and suggested this as the main ionizing source in the area .",
    "several kinematic distances ( 2.6 , 3.1 , 3.3 , 12.3 , and 12.6 kpc ) to the region are listed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , it has been pointed out by @xcite that the mir bubbles located at the galactic plane are likely to be veiled behind the foreground diffused emission if they are situated at a distance larger than @xmath128 kpc .",
    "hence , it is unlikely for the bubble n37 to be located at a distance of about 12 kpc .",
    "therefore , in this work , we have adopted a distance of 3.0 kpc , the average value of all available near - kinematic distance estimates .",
    "we infer from the previous studies that the bubble is associated with an hii region and an irdc together",
    ". however , the physical conditions inside and around the bubble n37 are not yet known , and the ionizing source(s ) of the bubble is yet to be identified .",

    "the detailed multi - wavelength study of the region will allow us to study the ongoing physical processes within and around the bubble n37 . to study the physical environment and star formation mechanisms around the bubble , we employ multi - wavelength data covering from the optical , near - infrared ( nir ) to radio wavelengths .",

    "this bridge - like feature is indicative of a cloud - cloud collision @xcite .",
    "these authors also suggested that the collision between two molecular clouds can be a potential mechanism to trigger the formation of massive stars .",
    "very recently , observational evidences of the cloud - cloud collision and the formation of massive stars through this process have been reported in the galactic star - forming regions rcw120 @xcite and rcw 38 @xcite .    according to @xcite and @xcite",
    ", a collision between two non - identical clouds can produce a dense layer at the interface of these clouds and can create a cavity in the large cloud ( see figure 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "the compressed dense layer has the ability to develop the dense cores , which can subsequently form massive stars .",
    "after the formation of massive stars , their strong uv radiation can ionize the surrounding gas and develop an h ii region .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cloud - cloud collision has formed an o - type star in the rcw 120 region , and made it to appear as a broken bubble .",
    "it is mentioned before that the n37 molecular cloud hosts a pillar - like structure , irdc , and the mir bubble n37 .",
    "the cloud also harbors ysos clusters that are associated with the irdc and pillar - like structure .",
    "it is possible that the cloud - cloud collision has influenced the star formation within the n37 molecular cloud ( including the irdc , ob stars , and the pillar - like structure ) .",
    "the massive ob stars might have formed due to a similar formation mechanism as it is reported for rcw 120 . with time",
    ", the massive ob stars developed an hii region and the mir bubble morphology appears to be originated due to the expansion of the photoionized gas ( see section  [ sec : ratt ] ) .",
    "it is also possible that the collision between two molecular clouds might have developed the broken cavity and that is why the n37 bubble has appeared with a broken structure .",
    "however , we do not have enough observational evidences to firmly conclude about the origin of the broken feature of the n37 bubble .",
    "we calculated the dynamical age of the hii region ( t@xmath131 ) towards the n37 bubble to be @xmath1320.7 myr for an ambient density of 10000 @xmath63 ( see section  [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "in general , the average ages of class  i and class  ii ysos are @xmath120.44 myr and @xmath1213 myr @xcite , respectively . considering these ages , it is unlikely that the star formation in the n37 cloud has been triggered by the expansion of the hii region . for further confirmation , we determined the average ages of ysos toward the bubble , the pillar and the clump c1 which is , however , part of c25.29 + 0.31 molecular cloud .",
    "the distribution of class i and class ii ysos overplotted on the 8 @xmath13 image are shown in figure  [ fig13]a .",
    "a total of 13 , 7 and 10 ysos are found to be situated toward the n37 bubble , the pillar and the c1 , respectively , for which the sed modeling was performed ( see figure  [ fig13]b )",
    ". corresponding mean ages of these ysos are estimated to be 1.0 , 0.7 and 0.7 myr , respectively , which are comparable to the dynamical age of the h ii region of 0.7 myr . for a triggered star formation to occur the mean ages of ysos",
    "should be less compared to the dynamical age of the h ii region .",
    "however , the mean ages are associated with large standard deviations ( @xmath120.5 myr ) and hence , it is not possible to make a definite conclusion from this analysis .",
    "we have also plotted the cumulative distribution of ages of ysos toward the bubble , c1 , and the pillar ( see figure  [ fig13]c ) .",
    "it can be seen in the cumulative distributions of the ages that the majority of the ysos ( at least @xmath1260% ) located towards the pillar are younger than the ysos towards the bubble and c1 .",
    "hence , the formation of stars towards the pillar and c1 might have started later than the bubble .",
    "though the ysos associated with the pillar and the c1 are younger than the ysos towards the bubble , the dynamical age of the h ii region is not consistent enough to conclude whether they have formed due to the influence of bubble / massive ob stars .",
    "note that in this paper we do not discuss results related to the c25.29 + 0.31 cloud , which hosts the clump c1 , the iras 18335@xmath170646 , and the star a805 ( an o7ii spectral type ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it should be mentioned here that the pillars are generally assumed to be potential sights of triggered star formation @xcite , and young stars are expected to appear at the tip of the pillars @xcite .",
    "a few class i and class ii ysos are found to be associated with the pillar ( see figure  [ fig13]a ) and these ysos might have formed by some other mechanisms than triggered by the ob stars or h ii region .    it can be noticed in figure  [ fig10]b , even though the mean polarization position angles are generally uniform at a galactic position angle of @xmath1260@xmath133 throughout the region , random changes in the polarization position angles are noticed near the interface of the n37 molecular cloud and the clump c1 which is part of the c25.29 + 0.31 molecular cloud .",
    "we suggest that this change in the polarization position angles can be explained by a distortion of gas due to the collision between these two molecular clouds .",
    "overall , this region correlates well with the observational signatures proposed for the cloud - cloud collision process .",
    "in addition to the formation of ob stars , the cloud - cloud collision might have also triggered the formation of several other yso clusters in the n37 molecular cloud .",
    "we performed a multi - wavelength analysis of the galactic mir bubble n37 and its surrounding environment .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate the physical environment and star formation mechanisms around the bubble .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are the following .",
    "\\1 . in the selected @xmath134 region around the mir bubble n37 ,",
    "two molecular clouds ( n37 molecular cloud and c25.29 + 0.31 ) are present along the line of sight .",
    "the molecular cloud associated with the bubble ( i.e. n37 molecular cloud ) is depicted in the velocity range from 37 to 43 km s@xmath3 , while the c25.29 + 0.31 cloud is traced in the velocity range from 43 to 48 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the n37 molecular cloud appears to be blue - shifted with respect to the c25.29 + 0.31 cloud .",
    "\\2 . using photometric criteria",
    ", we find a total of seven ob stars within the n37 bubble , and spectroscopically confirmed two of these sources as o9v and b0v stars .",
    "the physical association of these sources with the n37 bubble is also confirmed by estimating their spectro - photometric distances .",
    "the o9v star is found as the primary ionizing source of the region .",
    "this result is in agreement with the lyman continuum flux analysis using the 20 cm data .",
    "several molecular condensations surrounding the n37 bubble are identified in the _ herschel _ column density map .",
    "the physical association of these condensations with the n37 bubble is inferred using the molecular gas distribution as traced in the integrated @xmath4co ( j=10 ) map .",
    "surface density analysis of the identified ysos reveals that the ysos are clustered toward these molecular condensations .",
    "the mean ages of ysos located in different parts of the region indicate that it is unlikely that these ysos are triggered by energetics of the ob stars present within the bubble .",
    "this interpretation is supported with the knowledge of the dynamical age of the h ii region .",
    "the position - velocity analysis of @xmath4co data shows that two clouds ( n37 molecular cloud and c25.29 + 0.31 ) are interconnected with a lower intensity emission known as broad bridge structure .",
    "the presence of such feature suggests the possibility of interaction between the n37 molecular cloud and the c25.29 + 0.31 cloud .",
    "the position - velocity analysis of @xmath4co emission also reveals an inverted c - like structure , suggesting the signature of an expanding hii region .",
    "based on the pressure calculations ( p@xmath135 , @xmath136 , and p@xmath69 ) , the photoionized gas associated with the bubble is found as the primary contributor for the feedback mechanism in the n37 cloud .",
    "possibly the expanding hii region is responsible for the origin of the mir bubble n37 .",
    "the collision between two clouds ( i.e. n37 molecular cloud and c25.29 + 0.31 ) might have changed the uniformity of the molecular cloud which is depicted by a slight change in the polarization position angles of background starlight .",
    "the collision between the n37 molecular cloud and the c25.29 + 0.31 cloud might have triggered the formation of massive ob stars .",
    "this process might also have triggered the formation of ysos clusters in the n37 molecular cloud .",
