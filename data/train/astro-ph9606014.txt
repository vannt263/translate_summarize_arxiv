    "the type ia supernova remnant g327.6 + 14.6 , or sn 1006 , is the remnant of the explosion which took place in ad 1006 .",
    "the distance to this source is between 1.4 and 2.1 kpc ( green 1988 ) .",
    "its mean expansion rate has been measured as @xmath1 arcsec / yr , which implies a present expansion speed of @xmath2 km / s for an average distance of 1.8 kpc . the time dependence of the expansion ( @xmath3 ) is consistent with sedov expansion , or with a forward / reverse shock pair moving into constant - density material ( moffett , goss , & reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "the asca detection of power law x - ray emission from the bright northeastern ( ne ) and southwestern ( sw ) rims of sn 1006 led koyama et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to infer the existence of electrons accelerated by the first order fermi mechanism up to energies of @xmath4 tev .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath5-rays from this system will prove the existence of such ultrarelativistic electrons ( de jager et al .",
    "1995 , mastichiadis 1996 , pohl 1996 ) .    in section 2 we will compile the non - thermal radio to x - ray spectrum , which may be due to synchrotron emission from these electrons , and in section 3 we will compare the acceleration and loss timescale for electrons accelerated by the first order fermi process , and show that the resulting maximum electron energy predicts a synchrotron cutoff frequency which is consistent with observations .",
    "the best - fit spectrum also leads to the derivation of the magnetic field strength @xmath6 associated with the shell . in section 4",
    "we will calculate the inverse compton ( ic ) @xmath5-ray spectrum associated with this best - fit model spectrum from section 3 .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath5-rays from sn 1006 will enable the observer to determine the magnetic field strength , and an important parameter associated with fermi acceleration from the observed @xmath5-ray flux .",
    "the radio morphology shows two bright arcs towards the ne and sw ( see e.g. reynolds & gilmore 1993 ) , with a composite spectrum which is given by @xmath7 and shown in fig .",
    "1 . the individual radio flux measurements for the total emission from sn 1006 ( reproduced from fig . 1 of reynolds 1996 )",
    "are also shown for comparison .",
    "rosat imaging observations of sn 1006 shows that the soft x - ray remnant is dominated by thermal ( @xmath8 kev ) emission towards the se , whereas the x - ray counterparts of the ne and sw radio rims ( or  hard aegis \" ) are characterized by a power law spectrum which dominates the total emission from the remnant above @xmath9 kev ( willingale et al . 1996 ) .",
    "spatially resolved spectral results by asca have shown that these bright rims are responsible for @xmath10 of the total x - ray flux from sn 1006 above 1 kev , and the interior of the remnant also contains this non - thermal emission , which dominates the thermal component above 2 kev ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ) . the results from earlier non - imaging instruments are therefore useful to obtain the non - thermal spectrum above 1 kev from the entire remnant .",
    "for example : tenma ( koyama et al .",
    "1987 ) , exosat ( jones & pye 1989 ) , and ginga ( ozaki et al .",
    "1994 ) obtained well - constrained spectral energy indices ranging between @xmath112.0 and @xmath112.3 for energies between 1.5 kev and @xmath12 kev .",
    "this is confirmed by the energy index of @xmath13 of the ne rim found by asca ( koyama et al .",
    "the exosat me field of view was just large enough to cover the entire remnant , without significant background contamination , and the energy spectrum above 1.5 kev ( derived from the given energy flux ) is given by @xmath14 which is shown together with the radio spectrum in fig . 1 .",
    "the change from a @xmath110.56 radio energy index to a @xmath15 x - ray energy index above @xmath9 kev is indicative of a spectral turnover or break around @xmath16 kev , where the spectral energy index should be around @xmath111 ( depending on the sharpness of the cutoff ) .",
    "in fact , soft x - ray imaging observations of the hard aegis by the einstein sss ( becker et al .",
    "1980 ) and exosat le ( jones & pye 1989 ) resulted in a consistent spectral energy index of @xmath111.2 .",
    "willingale et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used rosat pspc observations to separate the thermal and non - thermal energy fluxes of the hard aegis and the rest of the remnant , with the same finding as koyama et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the non - thermal soft x - ray flux from the hard aegis contributes to @xmath10 of the total non - thermal soft x - ray flux of @xmath17 ergs/@xmath18/s ( for the 0.1 kev to @xmath19 kev range ) .",
    "assuming the average spectral index of @xmath111.2 found by einstein and exosat ( willingale et al .",
    "1996 obtained a spectral index for the sw limb only ) , but using the rosat normalization for the total non - thermal flux from sn 1006 , the resulting energy spectrum for this energy range is therefore @xmath20 and is indicated by its spectral index in fig .",
    "the non - thermal synchrotron emission of sn1006 from shock accelerated electrons has been discussed by reynolds & chevalier ( 1981 ) , ammosov et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and , more recently , by reynolds ( 1996 ) . here",
    "we apply the method given in mastichiadis ( 1996 - henceforth m96 ) .",
    "this allows us to treat the problem in a self - consistent manner by calculating the electron distribution function at each instant in time from the solution of a time - dependent kinetic equation for electrons .",
    "the physical picture is according to the ` onion - shell - model ' ( bogdan & vlk 1983 ) as applied to time - dependent acceleration ( ball & kirk 1992 ) .",
    "therefore we assume that electrons are accelerated in the ( parallel ) shock wave of the expanding supernova remnant and at each instance there is a flux of relativistic electrons which escape downstream and subsequently radiate . for these",
    "we assume to have a power law spectrum in energy , i.e. @xmath21 with @xmath22 and an exponential cut - off for @xmath23 ( webb et al .",
    "for the determination of the normalization factor we followed m96 ( after an original suggestion by drury 1992 ) and set @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radius of the supernova and @xmath26 is the velocity of the shock .",
    "furthermore , the maximum energy electrons can achieve at a time t depends on whether synchrotron losses become dominant or not and it is given by the minimum of ( lagage & cessarsky 1983 , webb et al .",
    "1984 , m96 and reynolds 1996 ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the shock velocity in units of km / sec , b is the magnetic field strength in gauss , @xmath30 is the supernova remnant age in years , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the compression ratio of the shock connected with the spectral index @xmath33 through the relation @xmath34 .",
    "also @xmath35 is the gyrofactor , i.e. the ratio of the particle s mean free path to its gyroradius .",
    "the case @xmath36 corresponds to a simple bohm diffusion .",
    "the relevant energy losses which were included in the kinetic equation were adiabatic due to the expansion of the remnant , synchrotron and inverse compton .",
    "the only free parameter here is the magnetic field as the photon fields on which the electrons lose energy by inverse compton scattering are rather well determined ( see section 4 below ) .    adopting standard supernova parameters , i.e. a total explosion energy of @xmath37 erg , an initial shock velocity of @xmath38 km / sec and an external matter density of @xmath39 h - atom/@xmath40 ( willingale et al .",
    "1996 ) we solved numerically the electron kinetic equation which includes a source term and loss terms as these were described above ( for more details see m96 ) .",
    "the obtained electron distribution function was folded with the synchrotron emissivity to obtain the radiated spectrum as this should be observed at a time @xmath41 years .",
    "this way we have made numerical fits to the radio / x - ray data by treating as free parameters the strength of the magnetic field downstream , the gyrofactor @xmath35 and the shock compression ratio @xmath32 .",
    "fig.1 shows the best fit to the radio and x - ray spectra ( shown here as full lines ) which was obtained for @xmath42 g and @xmath43 ( corresponding to @xmath44 ) .",
    "this fit holds for @xmath45 .",
    "as @xmath35 increases above this value the spectrum starts to break due to synchrotron losses and no satisfactory fit could be found .",
    "therefore x - ray data alone might not be able to constrain @xmath35 significantly .",
    "more constraints on @xmath35 can be placed from future tev observations as we will show in the next section .",
    "we proceed now by giving a simple qualitative picture which will help in the understanding of our results : according to the standard picture of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants ( see , for example , dorfi 1991 ) both @xmath46 and @xmath47 peak close to the transition of the supernova remnant from its free expansion to its sedov phase which occurs at @xmath48 . for example , @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 . similarly ,",
    "@xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "therefore the radiation observed now should be dominated by the particles accelerated at @xmath57 .",
    "using eqn .",
    "( 4 ) we get that the maximum particle energy at @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 @xmath60 is a factor ( of order unity ) that reflects the fact that at @xmath61 the velocity is not any more @xmath62 but somewhat smaller since deceleration of the shock should have started before that time .",
    "this in turn implies that the energy @xmath47 as given by eqn .",
    "( [ esedov ] ) is , strictly speaking , an upper limit of the maximum energy the electrons can attain during acceleration .",
    "equation ( [ esedov ] ) is the maximum energy electrons can attain as long as this is smaller than @xmath63 ( equation [ [ elos ] ] ) . a comparison of the two expressions for @xmath61 yields that this is indeed the case as long as @xmath64  g. if this relation is satisfied then synchrotron losses do not become important at _ any _ epoch , since for @xmath52 , @xmath51 while @xmath65 .",
    "> from the above discussion it becomes evident that if radiation losses do not become important then the synchrotron spectrum that the current model predicts can be fairly well represented by the synchrotron spectrum which is derived from a simple electron distribution function ( power law times exponential cutoff ) of the form @xmath66 } 4\\pi d^2,\\ ] ] with units in total number of electrons per erg while @xmath67 is in ergs . the best - fit value for the magnetic field is given by @xmath68 @xmath69 g while @xmath70 .",
    "the area factor @xmath71 allows us to calculate photon spectra in terms of the flux at earth if @xmath72 is used .",
    "using the best fit value for @xmath6 the total energy content in relativistic electrons is @xmath73 erg .",
    "this in turn gives us an efficiency of cosmic ray electron production of @xmath74 in rough agreement with the hypothesis that about a few percent of the supernova energy available for acceleration goes to electrons .",
    "several soft photon fields may contribute to the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of relativistic electrons into the @xmath5-ray region .",
    "de jager ( 1996 ) discussed the production of @xmath5-ray spectral features introduced by the scattering of several thermal photon spectra by the electron cutoff ( with maximum electron energy @xmath75 ) in snr w44 , which may explain the egret detection ( 2eg j1857 + 0118 , thompson et al .",
    "1996 ) of this remnant .",
    "the cutoff in the spectrum derived in section 3 will similarly produce @xmath5-ray bumps on a @xmath76 plot ( as in fig .",
    "1 ) at @xmath5-ray energies @xmath77 ( in the thomson limit ) or @xmath78 ( in the klein - nishina limit ) , with @xmath79k representing the cmbr , @xmath80k the galactic dust contribution , @xmath81k representing the population ii stars , and @xmath82k representing the contribution from population i stars , with densities given by skibo ( 1993 ) .",
    "arendt ( 1989 ) also did not detect any significant fir emission associated with swept up dust in sn 1006 , so that there would be no contribution to soft photons from sources inside or near sn 1006 , in contrast with w44 where the emission from swept - up dust dominates all soft photon fields .",
    "we include all soft photon fields , using the full cross section for isotropic ic as reviewed by blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) in the calculation of the @xmath5-ray spectrum .",
    "the ic spectra calculated from the best - fit electron spectrum ( eqn .  [ [ best ] ] ) for different @xmath35-values are also shown in fig . 1 , and it is clear that the @xmath5-ray energy flux peaks at a few tev ( nearly independent of the value of @xmath35 ) , the dominant source of this bump being the cmbr photons scattered in the thomson limit .",
    "the integral flux above 1 tev is given by @xmath83 with @xmath35 constrained to values below @xmath84 .",
    "the crab spectrum in the range 0.5 to 10 tev ( djannati - ata 1995 ) is also shown for comparison in fig . 1 , and it is clear that we may expect sn 1006 to be a stronger source than the crab at 1 tev if @xmath85 .",
    "it is also clear that the egret upper limit of sn 1006 shown in fig .",
    "1 does not constrain @xmath35 significantly , but tev observations will provide valuable limits .",
    "finally we would like to note that the tev flux as given above is about an order of magnitude higher than the expected flux from the nuclear component of cosmic rays assumed to be accelerated also at the supernova shock ( drury et al .",
    "the recent x - ray observations of sn 1006 ( koyama et al . 1995 ) make a strong case for particle acceleration in supernova remnants .",
    "a necessary consequence of this is that sn 1006 can be a source of tev radiation as the accelerated electrons will scatter off the ambient soft photons to very high energies . in the present paper we calculated the expected tev flux by following the basic principles of first order fermi shock acceleration to fit the radio / x - ray observations and consequently we used the derived electron distribution function to calculate the tev emissivity .",
    "in this case we found that the tev flux depends sensitively on the gyrofactor @xmath35 of the accelerated electrons and consequently one can use any future tev observations of sn 1006 to put limits on this .",
    "we find that the egret upper limit ( derived from thompson et al .",
    "1996 ) does not constrain @xmath35 significantly , but imaging tev observations have no difficulties observing sources nearly 10 times weaker than the crab .",
    "we may therefore be able to detect sn 1006 at tev energies if @xmath35 is not too large .",
    "the ne and sw limbs may be detectable by the atmospheric imaging cherenkov technique ( see e.g. weekes et al .",
    "1989 ) if a search for the ne and sw rims are made .",
    "however , the flux for each rim would be @xmath86 of the flux given in eqn .",
    "( [ ftev ] ) for the total tev emission from sn 1006 , but by superimposing the pixels from the tev image corresponding to the ne and sw rims , the total flux should be about 75% of the flux given in eqn .",
