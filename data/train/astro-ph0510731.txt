    "probably the most audacious endeavours in modern physical science are : ( 1 ) the attempt to understand the laws governing the whole of physical reality down to the smallest imaginable scales ; and ( 2 ) the attempt to find a quantitative description of the properties of the entire universe on the largest scales .",
    "since the universe is known to be expanding and cooling , then these two quests become linked at the earliest epochs , and hence fundamental physics and cosmology are necessarily connected .",
    "we do not yet have a complete theory to describe high energy physics , but at below tev energies our understanding is on extremely firm ground .",
    "the combination of quantum chromodynamics with electroweak theory is known as the standard model of particle physics ( hereafter smpp ) .",
    "the smpp was solidified in the early 1970s and has been incredibly well tested since then ( see @xcite and earlier editions of the ` particle data book ' ) .",
    "the smpp contains a finite number of parameters , which are unrelated , at least within the context of the theory itself .",
    "one imagines that a more complete theory of fundamental physics will explain the relationships among these parameters .",
    "the ultimate goal would be to determine the values of the parameters from pure mathematics , once the correct theory is discovered .",
    "it may also be that some of the parameters have a stochastic origin , where our universe is one choice from among an array of possible vacuum states .",
    "this used to be called anthropic reasoning ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and received such little respect from many scientists that it became known as ` the a word ' , and would elicit groans at conferences .",
    "but now string theorists have renamed it ` the landscape ' @xcite and given it some theoretical basis .",
    "although these ideas may now have a little more mainstream credibility ( and are discussed in a later section ) , still not everyone agrees that it is a worthy avenue of inquiry .",
    "the number of parameters within the standard model varies slightly among phenomenologists , depending on precisely how minimal the model under consideration is , and , in particular , how the neutrinos are treated .",
    "a popular counting exercise gives 19 parameters in the minimal smpp , plus 7 additional quantities to describe the neutrino sector .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab : smpp ] .",
    "there are 26 free parameters in this model ; if we were to develop the smpp from scratch , then presumably we would label the parameters as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ",
    ", @xmath3 .",
    "given this proliferation of numbers , one expects that , for the sake of elegance , there must be a more fundamental theory with far fewer parameters .",
    "[ tab : smpp ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there are 3 different levels of randomness that enter into this discussion ( see table  [ tab : stoch ] ) . at the weakest level , some smc parameters are stochastic in the sense that we happen to measure them at a particular epoch .",
    "there is no obvious property which would have prevented us from asking about the universe if we lived in a civilisation several billion years into the past or the future .",
    "if we define some parameters to be simply the quantities at the time we measure them , then their values will be partly accidental in the sense that the epoch we are living at contains some randomness .",
    "this may seem like a fairly ineffectual kind of stochasticity , but it has the virtue of being easy to understand , and undeniably real .    a stronger level of stochasticity comes from the ` cosmic variance ' idea .",
    "there is a certain volume in which we can make measurements , defined by the region within which light can have reached us in the age of the universe .",
    "we _ know _ that each hubble patch has an overall density fluctuation of order @xmath4 , since the power spectrum gives roughly that amplitude at ` horizon crossing ' . the density within our patch could easily be a several @xmath5 excursion from the average value , without it seeming terribly unlikely .",
    "this means that the global value of @xmath6 can never be determined to better than 4 decimal places .",
    "and the same applies to all the other @xmath7s .",
    "a more extreme example of this same principle comes from the cosmic dipole  one can measure its value , but since its relative variance is large between observers , then the value we measure is almost entirely a random number . in general ,",
    "_ all _ of the detailed 3-dimensional structure of the observable universe falls into this category .",
    "some initial fields chose particular realisations consistent with some expectation values , and this ultimately led to objects such as the great wall , the local supercluster , the milky way galaxy , and the detailed configuration of matter within them .",
    "the final level of randomness comes when one considers that there may be multiple vacuum states into which different volumes fell .",
    "each of these volumes would then have inflated in a different way and may have had different values of the parameters of the smpp . whether we consider these as separate ` universes ' or as different volumes within a single space - time",
    "may be simply semantics .",
    "a useful outcome of considering the origin of the parameters of the smc may be that one is naturally led to the idea that several of the parameter values contain a non - deterministic element , and that there are different levels of randomness .",
    "it may then be more reasonable to imagine that quantities such as the vacuum energy could be stochastic in nature .",
    "and so more generally , the idea of different volumes having different smpp parameters may seem like less of a conceptual leap .",
    "seen in this light the details of the smpp may just be extensions of the smp , as observed in our particular universe .",
    "whether the probability distributions of any quantities can be calculated ( or even defined ) is altogether a different question .",
    "a great deal has already been said , and debated , about the reality of the multiverse , and principles of selection , mediocrity , fine tuning , biophilia , anthropy , copernicanism and the like @xcite , and little can be added here .",
    "the main point to make is that our current picture of the universe contains elements of happenstance , and that learning more about the cosmological model may help us to understand this randomness , and hence the bigger picture .",
    "an extension of the idea that stochasticity plays some role in establishing parameter values is that we may be able to lump the parameters of the smc and the smpp together as part of the set of observables of our corner of the multiverse .",
    "there are many ongoing and planned surveys which will improve the determination of the parameters of the smc .",
    "these include new cmb experiments , particularly the next generation satellite mission _ planck _ , scheduled for launch in about 2 years .",
    "the capabilities of _ planck _ mean that it may be the experiment which takes us beyond the smc .",
    "there are several new experiments designed to measure cmb polarization from either the ground or balloons , and there are also ambitious plans for another satellite mission in the more distant future to try to detect the inflationary b - modes . additionally , there are aggressive plans for measuring weak lensing , supernova distances and galaxy cluster abundances , all of which should particularly help improve the uncertainties on @xmath8 .    if the smc is already in good shape , then why should we bother placing more stringent bounds on its parameters ?",
    "the main reason to determine these quantities more precisely is that these are _ the _ numbers that describe _ the whole universe _ , and so they should just be measured better simply because they re there .",
    "the secondary reason is that one can only uncover inadequacies in the framework by making more precise measurements .",
    "since the smc is not self - contained in any way , then there may well be major features which are currently missing .      the first 3 of these issues may have resolutions at energy scales which _ might _ be accessible at accelerators .",
    "but the inflationary parameters are probably probing energies @xmath9gev , far beyond the reach of any terrestrial experiment .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field generically have the right properties to be the initial conditions for the cmb anisotropies , and indeed to make all structures in the universe today through gravitational instability .",
    "inflation also solves some conceptual problems with the big bang framework , including answering the ` why is the universe expanding today ' problem  the old answer used to be ` because it was expanding yesterday ' , but now there is the slightly more satisfactory answer ` because inflation started it off ' . however , there is still the question of _ why _ the universe inflated . or more succinctly , ` where did everything come from ? '",
    "then there are the coincidence problems : why is the dark energy starting to dominate now ? and why is @xmath10 ?",
    "the first of these questions suggests some selection in time , if not among vacuum states . the second may be a clue about physics beyond the smpp , but whether it needs to have a stochastic element is unclear",
    "of course some coincidences may not need an underlying explanation , e.g.  why is the density in stars @xmath11 and why is @xmath12 so close to 1 ? but other apparent coincidences exist where it is not obvious if an explanation is required or not , e.g.  why is the redshift of matter - radiation equality so close to that of recombination of the hydrogen plasma ?    as well as tackling these ` why'-type issues , astrophysical cosmologists are busy trying to understand how galaxies form and evolve , when and how the very first stars formed , and what the relationship is between the formation of galaxies and their central black holes .",
    "this may seem like an entirely different endeavour from determining the parameters of the smc , but in fact it can not be done in isolation , since one needs to understand details of the non - linear tracers , foregrounds and astrophysical processing of all cosmological signals in order to measure the smc parameters .",
    "given that the smc raises more questions than it resolves , it seems clear that there must be a bigger picture which remains to be uncovered .",
    "it is truly surprising that the smc has remained essentially unchanged for a whole decade , but it seems inconceivable that our current model is the final word .",
    "it is , of course , possible that some of today s list of 12 parameters will be found to be fixed at their default values , at the same time that new degrees of freedom need to be added in order to fit future data - sets",
    ". there is no way to predict how the final cosmological model will be different from the current smc .    with the rich pickings of cosmological data out there , the smc will continue to be probed with increasing precision .",
    "one can see that the next decade looks every bit as exciting as the last .",
    "eventually one can imagine a day when we know precisely how many parameters are required and have a better idea of how they are determined ( including the level of randomness ) .    one can also take comfort in the fact that if we lived substantially earlier or later in the history of the universe it would be considerably more difficult to make precise cosmological measurements from which to quantify the universe in which we live .",
    "we do indeed live in interesting times .",
