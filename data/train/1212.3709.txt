    "[ [ section ] ]    in this paper we consider problems of stopping a brownian motion or a geometric brownian motion optimally on a finite time interval when it has a _ disorder _ , i.e. its drift coefficient changes at some unknown moment of time from a positive value to a negative one .",
    "we look for the stopping time that maximizes the expected value of the stopped process .",

    "the process @xmath8 is called a ( linear ) _ brownian motion with a disorder_.    adopting the bayesian approach , we let @xmath7 be a random variable defined on @xmath1 and independent of @xmath11 . in this paper , in view of applications ( see below ) , we assume that @xmath7 is _ uniformly distributed _ on a finite interval @xmath12 $ ] , possibly , with mass at @xmath13 , i.e. the distribution function @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability that the disorder presents from the beginning , and @xmath17 is the density of @xmath7 . the probability @xmath18 may be strictly positive .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the class of all stopping times @xmath20 of the process @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the following two optimal stopping problems for @xmath8 and the exponent of @xmath8 ( a _ geometric brownian motion with a disorder _ ) : @xmath21 the problems consist in finding the values @xmath22 , @xmath23 and finding the stopping times @xmath24 , @xmath25 at which the suprema are attained ( if such stopping times exist ) .",
    "the superscript @xmath26 stands for the problem for a _ linear _ brownian motion , while @xmath27 stands for a _ geometric _ brownian motion .",
    "observe that , roughly speaking , the processes @xmath28 and @xmath29 increase on average `` up to time @xmath7 '' and decrease on average `` after time @xmath7 '' .",
    "but since @xmath7 is not a stopping time , we can not simply take @xmath30 and need to stop by detecting the disorder based on sequential observation of @xmath8 .",
    "we provide solutions to problems using the results obtained in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the central idea is based on a reduction to a markovian optimal stopping problem using a change of measure .",
    "this approach has already been applied in the literature , but we were able to generalize it to the case of a finite time interval .    [ [ section-1 ] ]    for economic applications , the problems considered are related to the question when to quit a financial `` bubble '' . by a bubble",
    "we mean growth of an asset price based mainly on the expectation of higher future price ; eventually a bubble bursts and the price starts to decline .",
    "suppose that an asset price is modelled by a geometric brownian motion with a disorder @xmath31 : @xmath32 or , equivalently , @xmath33 s_t dt + \\sigma s_t d b_t ,",
    "\\qquad s_0 = 1.\\ ] ] thus the price initially has a positive trend , which changes to a negative one at an unknown time @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath34 correspond to the `` current '' moment of time , when one is in a long position on an asset with positive trend .",
    "usually , it is possible to predict that the trend will become negative by some ( maybe , distant ) time @xmath35 in the future .",
    "then one is interested in the question when it is optimal to sell the asset maximizing the gain .",
    "if nothing is known about the actual distribution of @xmath7 , it is natural to assume that @xmath7 is uniformly distributed on @xmath12 $ ] ( since the uniform distribution has the maximum entropy on a finite interval ) . interpreting the quantity @xmath36 as the average gain achieved by selling the asset at time @xmath37 , problem for a geometric brownian motion seeks for the optimal time to sell the asset .",
    "the problem for a linear brownian motion can be thought of as a problem of finding the optimal time to sell the asset provided that a trader has the logarithmic utility function , i.e. maximizes @xmath38 , which is equivalent to maximizing @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "an interesting result that follows from the solution of problems is the qualitative difference between _ risk - neutral _ traders who maximize @xmath36 and _ risk - averse _ traders who maximize @xmath38 : if @xmath42 ( i.e. the distribution of @xmath7 has no mass at @xmath43 ) , then a risk - neutral trader will sell the asset strictly before time @xmath35 with probability one ( @xmath44 ) , while a risk - averse trader will wait until the end of the time interval with positive probability ( @xmath45 ) ; see the theorem and remark  1 in section  [ results ] .",

    "it was shown that if @xmath46 satisfy some relation , the optimal stopping time is the first hitting time of the posterior probability process @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , to some level . in @xcite",
