    "the monitor project is a large - scale photometric survey of galactic open clusters and star forming regions . we intend to measure high - cadence time series photometry for @xmath0 cluster members over @xmath1 of sky , aiming to find the first transiting planets in open clusters , and tens - hundreds of low - mass eclipsing binary systems , possibly including brown dwarfs . for more details of the project s scientific goals and the results of simulations giving likely numbers of detected systems ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , hereafter paper i. a brief summary of the project is also given in @xcite .",
    "data processing in this project is challenging . in a typical night",
    "we obtain @xmath9 of imaging data using the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , and this can be as large as @xmath10 for some of the other instruments we are using ( for example megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope , hereafter cfht ) . since our survey covers @xmath11 clusters over @xmath12 nights per cluster , this is a multi - terabyte project .    @xcite",
    "give a detailed discussion of differential photometry problems and techniques , from the point of view of attempting to detect low - amplitude stellar oscillations , but many of their arguments apply equally to transit surveys .",
    "using ccd cameras , one can perform differential photometry on very large numbers of stars simultaneously , using non - variable stars in the field as comparison sources to remove transparency ( and other ) variations in the atmosphere .",
    "differential photometric precision at the sub-@xmath13 level can be readily achieved using this method , even in somewhat non - photometric conditions .",
    "our methodology is based on experience gained by members of our group from the university of new south wales extrasolar planet survey @xcite , and much of the pipeline code is now shared between the two projects .",
    "we describe the observations in  [ obs_section ] and the basic ccd data reduction in  [ dr_section ] .  [ dp_section ] gives an overview of the steps required to produce differential photometry , and hence lightcurves , from these data , and the practical details of their implementation are discussed in  [ implement_section ] and  [ lc_section ] .    in ",
    "[ noise_section ] we examine the noise properties of our data , with particular attention given to correlated ( ` red ' ) noise , which can be a serious problem in differential photometry @xcite .  [ seeing_section ] examines one particular source of correlated noise , namely seeing - correlated variations induced in the lightcurves by blending of flux from neighbouring sources into the photometric apertures , and in ",
    "[ sysrem_section ] we apply the sysrem algorithm @xcite to search for any further sources of correlated noise in the data .",
    "finally , we summarise our conclusions in  [ conc_section ] .",
    "we are using wide - field mosaic cameras on several telescopes to perform the survey , principally : the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the @xmath14 int ( @xmath15 2k@xmath164k ccds , @xmath17 field - of - view ) and megacam on the @xmath18 cfht ( @xmath19 2k@xmath164.5k ccds , @xmath20 fov ) in the northern hemisphere , and the eso / mpg @xmath21 wide field imager ( wfi ) ( @xmath22 2k@xmath164k ccds , @xmath23 fov ) and mosaic ii on the @xmath6 ctio blanco telescope ( @xmath22 2k@xmath164k ccds , @xmath24 fov ) in the southern hemisphere . due to the enormous quantity of data , a uniform strategy for observing ( where possible ) and data processing is essential .",
    "the peculiarities of scheduling for each of these telescopes limit our flexibility in observing strategy so this will be discussed only briefly .",
    "we observe in @xmath25 or @xmath26 , since this maximises signal - to - noise for our faint , red objects of interest , and minimises any colour - dependent atmospheric extinction , which can be difficult to correct in the lightcurves .",
    "the wide - field mosaic instruments we are using typically suffer from fringing in red bandpasses , so the sdss - like @xmath25 filter @xcite is preferred where available , since this minimises fringing due to its sharp red cut - off at @xmath27  , compared to the long red tail of the standard @xmath26 filters .",
    "exposure times are selected to give good signal to noise on the largest possible number of cluster members , while keeping the targets sufficiently bright that medium - resolution follow - up observations on @xmath6 class telescopes and high - precision radial velocities on @xmath28 class telescopes remain feasible .",
    "typically our exposures are in the range @xmath29 , so the survey efficiency is overhead dominated with the slow readout times for the mosaic instruments we are using ( most are @xmath30 ) . in several cases we cycle between multiple fields in a single cluster to increase our spatial coverage , or between multiple clusters , but we aim to obtain an observing cadence no worse than @xmath31 for clusters where we are primarily searching for eclipsing binaries , and @xmath32 for planet searches , or where short - term stellar variability is a problem , ie . the youngest clusters ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "accurate flat fielding is of critical importance in differential photometry , so we take extra care to ensure that this is done as well as possible .",
    "we find that twilight flat fields provide superior results compared to dome flat fields for all the instruments we are using , provided sufficient signal can be accumulated . for a typical detector with gain of a few @xmath33 , and a typical twilight flat illumination level of @xmath34 ,",
    "the poisson noise is @xmath35 , ie",
    ". a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath36 , which is equivalent to @xmath37 photon noise per pixel . averaged over a typical photometric aperture of @xmath38 radius",
    "this gives @xmath39  ie .",
    "a significant contribution . over a typical one week observing run , we can readily obtain at least @xmath40 flat field frames , which reduces the poisson noise to @xmath41 , a level which is perfectly acceptable for our purposes .",
    "a related issue is that of positioning the telescope . even using the flat fielding procedure described , small errors of the order of @xmath42 remain in the flat field frames , and fringing in the detectors , even after correction , can reach amplitudes of @xmath43 .",
    "the effects can be divided into low spatial frequencies , dominated by non - uniform illumination of the flat field frame , and high spatial frequencies , eg .",
    "fringing , or differential variations in the quantum efficiency of the pixels ( eg . as a function of wavelength , since the spectra of the flat field source and target star are different ) .",
    "the combination of these effects typically limits the achievable photometric precision to a few mmag depending on the instrument , in our experience . in order to minimise these effects",
    "we therefore aim to reposition each star on _ exactly _ the same pixel of the detector in each exposure .",
    "this is done by using the telescope guiding system to correct for pointing errors , where available .",
    "we note in passing that this procedure may introduce correlated noise ( see  [ noise_section ] ) , particularly in the event that any positioning errors are periodic or result in a slow drift across a few pixels of the detector .",
    "it has been suggested that an intentional random jitter in the telescope positions may prove beneficial to convert this source of correlated noise to a source of random noise .",
    "however , due to the need to move over a larger region of the detector , doing this is likely to introduce greater effects due to flat fielding errors , fringing , and other effects operating over short spatial scales .",
    "it therefore carries an inherent risk of raising the overall noise level , and thus would require more data , so we have been unable to explore it further as telescope time is always at a premium when using large international facilities .    equatorial standard star fields ( from the catalogue of @xcite )",
    "are observed regularly during our observing runs , to provide calibrated photometry on a standard zero - point system .",
    "the need for a uniform data processing strategy was highlighted in  [ obs_section ] .",
    "we employ a modified version of the int / wfc data reduction pipeline , developed for the int wide field survey ( wfs ) and originally described in @xcite .",
    "this has been successfully applied to data from all of the instruments mentioned in  [ obs_section ] at the time of writing .",
    "two of the instruments we are using ( int / wfc and ctio mosaic ) suffer from electrical cross - talk between the detector readouts , the effect of which is illustrated in figure [ m34_crosstalk ] .",
    "for the int / wfc the maximum level is @xmath44 , typically a sufficiently low level to be ignored , but for the ctio mosaic the level is @xmath45 . therefore , before starting the standard ccd reduction procedure this must be corrected , and is done in a simple manner by subtracting a fraction @xmath46 of the detected counts on detector @xmath47 from detector @xmath48 .    ) from ccd 4 to ccd 3 ( eg . at the position in the top panel corresponding to the pair of bright stars visible at the right of the bottom panel , marked with arrows ) , and negative cross - talk ( @xmath49 ) from ccd 3 to ccd 4 ( eg . at the position in the bottom panel corresponding to the brightest star on the left hand side of the top panel , marked with an arrow).,width=307 ]    we then follow the standard ccd reduction scheme of bias correction , trimming of overscan and non - illuminated regions , non - linearity correction , flatfielding and gain correction , followed by defringing , catalogue generation , astrometric and photometric calibration described in @xcite .",
    "we use the point source catalogue ( psc ) from the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) as an astrometric reference catalogue , which we find gives typical rms residuals of @xmath50 .",
    "in the discussion that follows , we use aperture photometry . the technique we use is similar to standard aperture photometry , except our apertures are ` soft - edged ' , and overlapping sources are fitted simultaneously using circular top - hat functions as the ` psf ' .",
    "we have found that for our open cluster fields , this technique is sufficient to obtain a photometric precision of @xmath51 for the brightest stars , without need to invoke more exotic techniques such as point spread function fitting ( psf - fitting ; eg .",
    "@xcite ) or difference image analysis ( dia ; @xcite , @xcite ) , although these are discussed briefly in  [ seeing_section ] .      robust , repeatable background estimation is of vital importance in aperture photometry .",
    "we use a variant of the technique discussed in @xcite for background estimation in our aperture photometry , which has been found empirically to work at least as well as the standard technique of using an annulus around the photometric aperture , for fields with slowly - varying sky backgrounds .",
    "a brief description of the method is given here , and the reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "briefly , the image is divided into a coarse grid of @xmath52 bins ( @xmath53 on sky ) .",
    "the background level in each bin is estimated using a robust @xmath54 clipped median of the counts in that bin , using the robust median of absolute deviations ( mad ; eg .",
    "@xcite ) estimator to calculate @xmath55 , and rejecting bad pixels using the confidence maps ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting map is filtered using 2-d bilinear and median filters to avoid problems due to single bins dominated by bright stars .",
    "the background in a given image pixel can then be estimated using bilinear interpolation over the coarse background map .",
    "differential photometry is very sensitive to small positioning errors when placing photometric apertures on the science images . for a gaussian psf",
    ", the error in the derived fluxes is given to first order by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the positioning error , @xmath58 is the radius of the aperture , and @xmath55 describes the psf size ( ie .",
    "seeing , @xmath59 ) .",
    "see appendix [ applac_deriv ] for a derivation .",
    "typically we set @xmath60 , ie .",
    "an aperture radius equal to the image fwhm , so : @xmath61 taking for example a typical value @xmath62 , this implies a flux error of @xmath63 .",
    "( [ applac_equation ] ) also confirms the intuitive result that using a larger aperture reduces the effect of centroid errors , at the cost of increased noise from the sky background .",
    "we therefore first consider the question of how best to determine the correct locations for the apertures .    the ` default ' technique used by existing source extraction software , as included in our pipeline ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or sextractor @xcite , is to find the centroid of each star on the ccd frame in question , to place an aperture at this position , and measure the flux .",
    "the accuracy to which this can be done for a star measured with signal to noise ratio @xmath64 improves in proportion to @xmath65 ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , giving the general ` rule of thumb ' that the error in the image centroid is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the sampling interval ( pixel scale ) , implying in general a decrease in the accuracy of aperture placement moving to fainter stars .",
    "a further problem is that as the seeing changes , the amount of blending in very close sources will also vary , to the point that they could become resolved in frames with good seeing , and unresolved in frames with poor seeing .",
    "this causes the centroid to shift in the unresolved ( or poorer seeing ) image toward the companion star , and hence results in a serious error in the aperture flux measurements .    the standard method for solving these problems , which we call `",
    "co - located aperture photometry ' , is therefore to use as many stars as possible to determine the aperture positions , in two stages .",
    "the first is to determine accurately the _ relative _ centroid positions of all the stars on the frame , which will be the same for all frames in the time - series ( provided the stars do not move ) .",
    "this can be done using a stacked image to increase @xmath64 ( we typically stack the @xmath68 frames with the best seeing , providing a @xmath69 four - fold improvement in @xmath64 over a single frame ) and thus obtain an improved master catalogue with more accurate relative positions .",
    "furthermore , since the placement of the apertures remains consistent , the effects of varying seeing are limited purely to varying flux loss from the apertures , which can be corrected to a good approximation by a global normalisation over the frame .    in the second stage , a transformation is computed between this _",
    "master frame _ and each frame in the time - series on a per - detector basis , using a standard 6-coefficient linear transformation , derived using a least - squares fit to a large number of bright stars . in this case",
    ", the error for the bright stars is dominated by the error in the transformation , and assuming sufficiently large numbers of stars were used , this is in turn dominated by errors in the model , eg . due to radial distortions or other similar effects .",
    "moreover , any errors in the mapping from the master frame to the individual frames will typically either affect all stars in the same way , or will be a smoothly - varying function of position .",
    "such effects are readily removed using a simple polynomial fit ( see  [ poly_section ] ) .",
    "figure [ cent_comp ] illustrates this for our m50 data . in this case we have used a simple constant multiplier to normalise each frame to the photometric system of the master frame , using an iterative @xmath70 clipped fit ( derived from the objects classified as stellar ) to remove any variable stars . in monitor data , although there is little to no improvement using the ` co - located apertures ' technique for the majority of sources , it is still necessary to eliminate the problem of centroid shifts in blended sources , as we have suggested .",
    "we suspect that this is the origin of the spurious variable sources seen in the upper panel of figure [ cent_comp ] .",
    "furthermore , another advantage is clear at the faint end , where it provides much more complete sampling , since we can still place an aperture and measure the flux even if the object does not pass the detection threshold on that particular frame , whereas in the upper panel , the object must be detected and the centroid computed before this can be done .",
    "-band observations of m50 , showing all objects of stellar morphological classification .",
    "the upper plot shows the results obtained by placing the photometric apertures at the centroid positions of the stars , as determined on each frame , and the lower plot shows the same using the ` co - located apertures ' technique .",
    "the plots have been truncated at @xmath71 since we require the sources to be detected in at least @xmath72 of the images for the upper diagram , and the detections start to become substantially incomplete for fainter magnitudes . in both cases ,",

    "significantly under - sampled data from the university of new south wales extrasolar planet search @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for the majority of images , an aperture with radius approximately equal to the fwhm of the stellar images achieves the optimal balance between flux loss ( and consequently , increased poisson noise in the counts ) and integrated noise in the sky background ( which increases with the area of the aperture ) .",
    "however , for bright sources , this wastes flux since the relative size of the sky noise contribution is much smaller , and a much larger aperture can be used .",
    "our aperture photometry procedure computes the flux in a sequence of apertures of radii @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , etc .",
    "( doubling the area each time ) where the ` core radius ' @xmath75 is set equal to the typical fwhm of stellar images ( and kept fixed for all the data ) .",
    "we use @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for the ctio-4m+mosaic data .",
    "we employ a simple procedure to make use of these measurements .",
    "the lightcurve is computed for each aperture separately , and the root mean square scatter ( computed using a robust median - based estimator ) compared for each source .",
    "we simply choose the aperture with the smallest rms for that star .",
    "this procedure ensures that larger apertures are used where they give an improvement for bright sources , but also accounts for blending , where using a larger aperture results in increased contamination of the flux measurement by neighbouring stars , and introduces modulations into the lightcurve as the seeing ( and hence the amount of contaminating flux in the aperture ) changes .    in order to place all the stars onto the same zero point system , this procedure necessitates using aperture corrections , to account for the differing amounts of flux lost from the different sized apertures .",
    "these are computed as simple ratios of the flux measured in the different apertures , for non - variable stars .",
    "the dominant effect of this procedure is to produce a small improvement in the achieved rms scatter for the bright stars in the sample .",
    "figure [ aper_comp ] shows a comparison between the results of using this procedure , and using only the @xmath75 ( smallest ) aperture .",

    "this can result from the combination of several effects , and is dominated by variations in transparency and overall extinction ( including the airmass - induced change in the extinction seen on the frame ) .",
    "nightly zero point correction using photometric standard star fields , as is commonly done for measuring absolute photometry , is sufficient to reach the level of a few percent down to @xmath82 .",
    "considerable progress can be made for the purposes of differential photometry , especially over small fields of view , by using non - variable stars in the field of interest to compute zero point shifts for each frame in the time - series .    for wide - field instruments such as the ones we are using , higher - order effects start to become significant . in particular , over a @xmath83 diameter field ( eg . int+wfc or ctio+mosaic from corner - to - corner ) , differential variations in airmass across the frame are no longer negligible . assuming the approximation for the airmass @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the zenith distance , and differentiating , @xmath86 substituting a typical value of @xmath87 , @xmath88 . for a typical @xmath89-band atmospheric extinction of @xmath90 ,",

    "we have opted for a generalised approach of fitting 2-d polynomials to the magnitude residuals for each non - variable reference star on each frame , rather than enforcing the particular airmass dependence for atmospheric extinction ( and in our experience this technique does indeed give better results ) .",

    "non - variable stars can be identified automatically by using the rms of the lightcurves to reject any variable sources .",

    "conventional results for the scintillation level have typically assumed that one star is observed at a time , and we might expect that some of the scintillation would be cancelled out in ccd photometry due to the availability of simultaneous observations of comparison stars .",
    "however , @xcite show that the typical coherence length is @xmath105 , so over the fields of view we are considering , the single star result should apply to a good approximation .",

    "the locus of stellar objects ( which all have approximately the same psf and hence the same flux ratios between apertures ) is defined in planes of flux ratio as a function of magnitude formed from several combinations of the measures .",
    "this is used to define a mean and standard deviation of the flux ratio for the stars , as a function of magnitude , and a normalised statistic is generated from this measuring how ` stellar - like ' each image is .",

    ". nevertheless , it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of using small random offsets to attempt to randomise the noise .",

    "the dominant effect was found to be seeing - correlated variations induced by image blending .",
    "variations in the seeing cause an increase in the amount of blended flux in the photometric apertures as the fwhm of the stellar images increases , so therefore we expect to find a correlation between the measured fwhm and the magnitude , for lightcurves of blended objects . this can be used both for flagging blended objects , and as we shall see , for removing some of the variations induced by blending .",
    "our source detection software flags any objects where the deblending algorithm ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) was invoked , and this flag is propagated into the lightcurves to assist with identifying blended objects . we have found empirically that the flag is often set for objects which do not exhibit any obvious blending effects in the lightcurves , since a greater degree of overlap is required before the object lightcurve becomes sufficiently contaminated .",
    "we therefore developed an empirical technique to characterise the level of blending - induced effects in each lightcurve , by looking for seeing - correlated shifts of the object from its median magnitude .",
    "this is done by fitting a simple quadratic polynomial to the shift as a function of the measured fwhm of the stellar images on the corresponding frame .",
    "some examples are shown in figures [ blend_comp_1 ] and [ blend_comp_2 ] .",
    "we use the following statistic to quantify the level of blending : @xmath168 where @xmath137 is defined as @xmath169 for lightcurve points @xmath170 with uncertainties @xmath136 , and @xmath171 is the median magnitude in the lightcurve .",
    "@xmath172 is the same statistic measured with respect to the quadratic model .",

    "figure [ blend_hist ] shows a histogram of the blend index , indicating the presence of a peak at @xmath176 , corresponding to objects showing clear seeing - correlated features due to blending , and another peak at @xmath177 corresponding to lightcurves without seeing correlations .",
    "the deblending flag from the source detection software appears to work well for selecting lightcurves with no blending , and hence no seeing correlation , but also flags relatively large number of objects showing little or no seeing - correlated behaviour , due to varying degrees of overlap .     for all lightcurves of stellar morphological classification in the ctio m50 data .",

    "the dotted line shows the @xmath189 prediction for white noise.,width=288 ]    it is important to note that this approach to removing the effects of blending , in reality , addresses the _ symptom _ , rather than the _ cause _ of the problem .",
    "since aperture photometry ( using multiple apertures ) is a simple approximation to full point spread function fitting ( hereafter , psf - fitting ) , it is not surprising that heavily overlapping images are not well - fit .",
    "a conventional method for reducing the effects of image blending is to move to psf - fitting photometry ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , using analytical or empirical psfs , or a mixture of the two .",
    "the use of psf - fitting brings with it a significant problem : that of accurately estimating the psf , which is particularly problematic over the wide fields of view we are using due to the presence of significant psf variations .",
    "difference image analysis ( dia ; @xcite , @xcite ) is a popular alternative , and is combined with aperture photometry , or even psf - fitting .",
    "briefly , in this method , the _ master image _ is subtracted from each of the images in the time series .",
    "the resulting difference image should contain mostly noise , and only sources which have varied in flux compared to the _ master image _ will remain . in reality",
    ", the psf varies from frame to frame on any real system , which would leave residuals on the difference images , so it is necessary to use an adaptive kernel @xcite , which is convolved with the master image to degrade the psf to match each target image , before subtraction .",
    "dia considerably simplifies the task of measuring photometry , since the flux from blended stars is cancelled out if they do not vary ( this is nearly always the case ) and therefore does not contribute to the sums over the photometric apertures .",
    "however , the method also suffers from the problem of psf estimation when computing the adaptive kernel . in most cases ,",
    "psf variations require a spatially - varying kernel @xcite to produce good results and avoid leaving residuals on the subtracted images for the non - variable stars .",
    "thus far , our attempts to use dia have not produced superior results to aperture photometry , although the work is still ongoing , particularly in the onc where extensive nebulosity limits the photometric precision available from aperture photometry . particularly in the case of our int data , where the images have variable ellipticities",
    ", we have found that the subtracted images contain significant residuals due to poor psf matching , and these introduce extra ( correlated ) noise into the lightcurves . in these data",
    ", the method does give some measurable improvement for blended stars , but overall higher levels of correlated noise and occasional serious lightcurve ` glitches ' in some objects .",
    "we have therefore chosen to continue using aperture photometry , until we can resolve these issues .",
    "this very popular method for finding ( unknown ) systematic effects in time - series photometry was presented by @xcite .",
    "the sysrem algorithm resembles a generalised form of principal component analysis ( pca ) , where the principal components are a set of generalised ` extinction ' and ` airmass ' terms .",
    "mathematically , the technique searches for the best two sets of coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath190 , to minimise the expression ( in the notation of @xcite ) : @xmath191 where the @xmath126 is the number of measurements in each lightcurve , @xmath192 is the number of lightcurves , @xmath193 is the residual ( mean - subtracted ) flux of object @xmath47 on frame @xmath48 , and @xmath194 is the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the products @xmath195 can then be subtracted from the lightcurves to remove this principal component , and the technique repeated for subsequent components , deriving progressively smaller corrections to the lightcurves .",
    "since the coefficients are not constrained to be the actual extinction and airmass , the technique also works for other forms of systematic effect .    by examining the coefficients , it is possible to determine the origin of the particular effect found by sysrem . in particular the terms @xmath190 ,",
    "representing the correction applied on each frame @xmath48 in the time series , are often correlated with the parameters of the images ( eg . the seeing ) , pointing to the true cause of that particular systematic effect .",
    "we have therefore undertaken such an analysis to find any residual effects in our data .",
    "figure [ sysrem_a ] shows a plot of @xmath190 for the first three sysrem components , and for comparison , plots of several important image parameters .",
    "figure [ sysrem_c ] shows the coefficients @xmath98 for each star , plotted as a function of @xmath196 colour .",
    "the first component seems to show its largest values on a few non - photometric nights , during periods of cloud .",
    "there is no clear correlation with @xmath196 colour .",
    "for the first three sysrem components plotted as a function of @xmath196 colour.,width=288 ]    the second component is clearly correlated with the image fwhm .",
    "this indicates that sysrem has found some residual effects of image blending , not corrected by the method described in  [ seeing_section ] .",
    "this component is also mildly correlated with @xmath196 colour ( see figure [ sysrem_c ] ) , which indicates that a wavelength - dependent effect ( eg . extinction ) has been detected .",
    "the third component shows very little structure , and gives a correction of very small amplitude ( @xmath197 ) , with only one or two frames having significantly non - zero values of @xmath198 , and no correlation with @xmath196 colour is apparent .",

    "the dotted line shows the @xmath189 prediction for white noise.,width=288 ]    the dotted line in figure [ sysrem_rednoise ] indicates that this method has not detected all of the red noise sources present in the data .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the work of other authors ( pont , private communication ) , and suggests that we still can not fully describe the sources of correlated noise in time - series data using the sysrem method .",
    "this is most likely to arise for effects which are not correlated between large samples of stars ( including the case where the effects are present in multiple stars , but at different times ) .",
    "we also note that some of the apparent ` red noise ' could be due to very low - amplitude stellar variability .",
    "@xcite find a very high occurrence of variability at the few mmag level , which is included in our ` red noise ' estimates if it occurs on a transit timescale .",
    "it should be noted that we do _ not _ at present apply the lightcurve corrections derived by sysrem ( or the method of  [ seeing_section ] ) to our standard lightcurve output .",
    "instead , the application of these filters is left to the user .",
    "specifically , they have not been used for our rotation work ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) or for visual transit searches , since at this level the systematics corrected tend only to introduce ( small numbers of ) false positives , which can be easily eliminated at the visual inspection stage , whereas the subtraction of the sysrem corrections carries with it the risk of introducing spurious variability from the residuals .",
    "we have developed a software pipeline for processing the high - cadence time - series photometric data generated by the monitor project , using aperture photometry , to achieve rms accuracy down to below @xmath199 at the bright end , typically with rms @xmath3 over @xmath200 ( eg .",
    "@xmath201 for the int / wfc using @xmath202 exposures , @xmath203 for the ctio-4m / mosaic using @xmath204 exposures ) .",
    "our lightcurves are stored in a convenient fits binary table format , designed for efficient storage of multiple lightcurves , and able to handle very large data - sets .",
    "noise properties of the data were investigated in  [ noise_section ] , finding correlated ( ` red ' ) noise at the level of @xmath7 over a @xmath140 transit - length timescale .",
    "these effects are important for transit searches since they reduce the effective signal to noise ratio of the transit detection statistic ( here @xmath131 as defined by @xcite ) , thus leading to reduced sensitivity to low - amplitude transits and those with few measured in - transit data points .",
    "@xcite examined the effect of the level of correlated noise on the yield of hot jupiter detections , finding that a level of @xmath104 gave a yield of @xmath69 half the value for no correlated noise , as compared to @xmath205 for example , where the yield was @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the effects of correlated noise on the yield of our survey are acceptable at the present level , but nevertheless we will continue to pursue avenues for improvement such as psf - fitting photometry .",
    "we have investigated seeing - correlated systematic effects in our lightcurves induced by image blending .",
    "a simple blend index was developed to quantify the level of these effects seen in a given lightcurve , based on the @xmath137 of a polynomial fit to the lightcurve magnitudes as a function of the measured image fwhm ( used as an estimate of the seeing ) .",
    "subtracting the fit was found to be an effective method for the removal of these seeing correlations , in lieu of the use of techniques to properly eliminate the effects of blending , such as psf - fitting photometry and difference image analysis .",
    "finally , the sysrem algorithm of @xcite was applied to the data , and the effect of each component examined , to look for further systematic effects .",
    "the removal of two components was found to be sufficient , with the first component removing some systematic effects mostly associated with what appear to be particularly poor - quality frames , and the second removing a seeing - correlated effect , most likely due to residual image blending .",
