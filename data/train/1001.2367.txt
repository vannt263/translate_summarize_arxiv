    "these results suggest that the jet phonemena in b335 are less active than those in the other sources .    in table 4 , we compare the protostellar properties of b335 to those of the other driving sources of the jets .",
    "it is clear that the bolometric luminosity of b335 is lower than that of hh 212 , 211 , and l1448-mm , although their bolometric temperatures are similar .",
    "the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the central stellar mass , which should be proportional to the mass accretion rate in the central accretion disk , is more than 2 - 3 times lower in b335 than in the other sources .",
    "hence , the lower mass - loss rate and the weaker jet activity in b335 compared to the other sources are likely to be linked with the lower mass accretion rate in b335 .",
    "we suggest that the jet activity is closely related to the properties of the central accretion process .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , the c@xmath2o emission at @xmath32@xmath33 = -0.6 and -0.3 km s@xmath7 shows elongation toward the east and s - e directions , respectively , which is similar to that of the outflow observed in @xmath0co ( 21 ) and @xmath1co ( 21 ) emissions . on the other hand , at around the systemic velocity ( @xmath32@xmath33 = 0.0 and 0.2 km s@xmath7 ) , the c@xmath2o emission is elongated perpendicularly to the outflow axis .",
    "in addition , there is a velocity gradient in the c@xmath2o emission along the outflow axis at around the systemic velocity , while no clear velocity gradient is seen across the outflow axis . in order to study the origin and kinematics of the c@xmath2o emission , in figure 9 , we compare the c@xmath2o emission , integrated in four different velocity ranges , with the @xmath1co emission integrated in the same velocity ranges and with the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission . at around the systemic velocity ( @xmath32@xmath33 = 0.0 and 0.2 km s@xmath7 ) ,",
    "both the blueshifted and redshifted c@xmath2o emission shows clear elongation perpendicular to the outflow axis and resembles the dust continuum emission in morphology .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1co emission at the same velocity is elongated along the outflow axis , and is likely to trace the outflow . the highly blueshifted c@xmath2o emission ( @xmath32@xmath33 = -0.9  -0.3 km",
    "s@xmath7 ) shows elongation toward the se with a slight extension toward the ne , and this morphology is similar to that of the @xmath1co emission at the same velocity . the highly redshifted c@xmath2o emission ( @xmath32@xmath33 = 0.5  0.8 km s@xmath7 ) shows a central condensation elongated perpendicularly to the outflow axis with a weak extension toward the sw .",
    "although the c@xmath2o emission shows an extension similar to the @xmath1co outflow shells , the overall structure of the c@xmath2o central condensation is not similar to that of the @xmath1co outflow at the same velocity range . therefore , the c@xmath2o emission ( at least at around the systemic velocity and probably at the highly redshifted velocity ) traces structures different from the outflow traced by the @xmath1co emission , and most likely traces the flattened molecular envelope perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "such a flattened molecular envelope has often been observed around low - mass protostars ( e.g. , ohashi et al .",
    "because the molecular outflow associated with b335 is aligned the plane of sky closely , it is naturally expected for the flattened envelope to have an almost edge - on configuration and to show an elongated structure seen in channel maps .    since the blueshifted and redshifted outflow",
    "emissions arise mostly from the east and west sides of the protostar , respectively , the eastern lobe of the outflow is tilted toward us from the plane of the sky .",
    "hence , the eastern part of the envelope is tilted away from us , while the western part of the envelope is tilted toward us from the plane of the sky . in this configuration ,",
    "the eastern part of the envelope is the far side , while the western side is the near side .",
    "the flattened envelope shows a velocity gradient along its minor axis with the blueshifted emission at the far side and the redshifted emission at the near side .",
    "this suggests that the flattened envelope has infalling motions toward the central protostar . in figure 10",
    ", we show a schematic picture of the configuration of the outflow and the infalling flattened envelope described above . from the peak offset between the channels at @xmath32@xmath33 = 0.0 and 0.2 km",
    "s@xmath7 , where the c@xmath2o emission most likely traces the flattened envelope , the velocity gradient along the minor axis was measured to be 3.7 @xmath8 10@xmath55 km s@xmath7 au@xmath7 . from this velocity gradient , the infall velocity was estimated to be 0.28 km s@xmath7 at a radius of 440 au on the assumption of an inclination angle of 10 .",
    "this infall velocity yields a central stellar mass of 0.02 @xmath10 in the case of the free - fall motion .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no detectable velocity gradient between these two channels ( @xmath32@xmath33 = 0.0 and 0.2 km s@xmath7 ) across the outflow axis , suggesting no detectable rotation in the flattened envelope on a hundred - au scale .",

    "two class 0 sources , ngc 1333 iras 2a @xcite and iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite , show similar cases ; their innermost envelopes showing disk - like structures also have no detectable rotation on a hundred - au scale .    in order to study the kinematics of the envelope in more detail",
    ", we constructed a simple model of a geometrically - thin infalling and rotating envelope with a gaussian intensity distribution and compared it with the observations . note that even though the actual envelope has a thickness , we use a model without thickness to make the model simpler .",
    "although the gaussian intensity distribution is an arbitrary choice , the choice of the intensity distribution does not affect main velocity structures .",
    "the radius of the model envelope was set to be 370 au based on the semi - major axis of the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission ( see @xmath623.1 ) .",
    "the inclination angle of the outflow @xcite was adopted as that of the envelope .",
    "the radial motion of the model envelope due to the dynamical infall is described as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the mass of the central star , while its angular motion due to rotation is described as @xmath85 because of the angular momentum conservation .",
    "based on the measurement of the infall velocity using the channel maps described above , the stellar mass was initially set to be 0.02 @xmath10 .",
    "the rotational velocity was set to be 0.04 km s@xmath7 at @xmath77 = 370 au , which corresponds to the detection limit , because there is no detectable rotation .",
    "then we generated synthesized images of the model envelope with the same uv - sampling as our sma observations .",
    "for the comparison between the model and the observations , we produced p - v diagrams from both the model and observations as shown in figure 11 .",
    "green contours in figure 11 @xmath86 and @xmath87 show the p - v diagrams derived from the model .",
    "this simple model can reproduce the main feature of the c@xmath2o p - v diagram both along the major and minor axis .",
    "we note that there is a velocity difference in the redshifted peak between the model and the observations . in order to match the model redshifted peak with the observed peak , we need to adopt a higher stellar mass in the model . in the case of a model with a stellar mass of 0.04 @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "11 @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the model redshifted peak better matches the observed peak . if we adopt an even higher stellar mass ( 0.08 @xmath10 ; fig .",
    "11 @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , the model blueshifted peak would be offset from the observed peak due to the larger line width .",
    "on the other hand , if we set a higher rotational velocity such as @xmath92 = 0.16 km s@xmath7 at @xmath77 = 370 au in the models ( fig . 11 @xmath93@xmath94 ) , there is a clear velocity gradient in the model p - v diagrams across the outflow axis , different from the observations which show no detectable velocity gradient across the outflow axis .",
    "therefore , the model with a stellar mass of 0.04 @xmath10 and a rotational velocity of 0.04 km s@xmath7 at a radius of 370 au provides a p - v diagram that matches the observations best .",
    "we note that there is a slight positional shift in the blueshifted peak between the model and observations in the p - v diagram across the outflow axis .",
    "although a higher inclination angle could provide a better match of the model blueshifted peak with the observed peak , the difference may be due to contamination of outflowing motions in the observations since part of the blueshifted emission may arise from the outflow .      from our simple model of the infalling envelope ( see @xmath624.2 ) , the infalling velocity in the envelope around b335 was estimated to be 0.310.44 km s@xmath7 at a radius of 370 au , which corresponds to a central stellar mass ( @xmath36 @xmath84 ) of 0.020.04 @xmath10 . with an envelope mass ( @xmath36 @xmath95 ) of 0.027 @xmath10 derived from the 1.3 mm continuum emission , the mass infalling rate ( @xmath96 ) and the accretion luminosity ( @xmath97 = @xmath98 ) were estimated to be 4.86.9 @xmath8 10@xmath14 @xmath10 yr@xmath7 and 0.72.1 @xmath5 , respectively , where 4 r@xmath49 is the radius of the protostar @xcite .",
    "hence , in b335 , the mass outflow rate of the @xmath0co jets ( @xmath99 = 3.1 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10 yr@xmath7 ) is 47 @xmath35 of the mass infalling rate , which is slightly smaller than the results in hh 212 @xcite and hh 211 @xcite , and the accretion luminosity is comparable to or smaller than the bolometric luminosity ( 1.5 @xmath5 ) .    in b335",
    ", the knotty distribution of the associated hh objects along the outflow axis likely suggests episodic jet ejection , and the high - velocity @xmath0co jet components found in our sma observations are likely to represent the latest ejection event .",
    "episodic jet ejections have been found in a number of protostellar sources , and are often linked to a sudden increase in the mass accretion @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite have revealed that many protostellar sources show one order of magnitude lower bolometric luminosity than the accretion luminosity predicted from the steady mass accretion model , and have proposed that the accretion is episodic and sources with lower bolometric luminosity than model predictions are probably in the quiescent stage .",
    "direct observational comparisons between the accretion luminosity derived from the observed infalling motion in the envelopes and the bolometric luminosity also suggest non - steady mass accretion . in hl tau @xcite ,",
    "l1551 irs 5 @xcite , and in iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite , the estimated accretion luminosities are an order of magnitude higher than the bolometric luminosity , and in hh 212 @xcite the accretion luminosity ( @xmath3 7 @xmath5 ) is lower than the bolometric luminosity ( 14 @xmath5 ) .",
    "this mismatch could be reconciled by a picture similar to the fu - ori phenomenon @xcite and episodic mass accretion .",
    "the protostar is surrounded by a disk , and outside of the disk there exists an infalling envelope .",
    "the material in the envelope keeps infalling onto the disk but not directly onto the surface of the protostar . in the `` non - active '' phase , most material in the disk",
    "does not accrete onto the surface of the protostar , and the jet ejection is also quiescent .",
    "hence , the accretion luminosity derived from the mass infalling rate in the infalling envelope could be higher than the bolometric luminosity , as in the case of hl tau , l1551 irs5 , and iras 16293 - 2422 . when the disk becomes massive and unstable ,",
    "the material accumulated in the disk starts falling onto the surface of the protostar , and then the powerful mass ejection also occurs @xcite .",
    "this is the `` active '' phase , when the accretion luminosity estimated from the outer infalling envelope could be lower than the `` real '' accretion luminosity , as in the case of hh 212 associated with the clear high - velocity jets .",
    "our detection of high - velocity molecular jets with a short dynamic time ( @xmath3 45 yr ) , and a possibly lower accretion luminosity than the bolometric luminosity in b335 , imply a recent burst of mass ejection and accretion .",
    "in addition , the [ oi ] line emission has been detected around the protostar in b335 , which could suggest the presence of shocks due to a recent ejection of the jets @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with the idea that b335 is in an `` active '' accretion phase .",
    "the infalling envelope traced by c@xmath2o ( 21 ) emission in b335 does not show any clear velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis , suggesting an absence of rotational motion in the envelope at the 300-au scale .",
    "the upper limit of the specific angular momentum was estimated to be 7 @xmath8 10@xmath11 km",
    "s@xmath7 pc ( see @xmath624.2 ) , which corresponds to a rotational velocity of 0.04 km s@xmath7 at a radius of 370 au .",
    "since the material within this radius is considered to be dynamically infalling ( see @xmath624.3 ) , the specific angular momentum of the material within this radius is supposed to be conserved .",
    "if this is the case , the centrifugal force of the rotation becomes balanced with the gravitational force due to the central protostar with a mass of 0.04 m@xmath100 at a radius of @xmath3 6 au , which can be considered an upper limit for the radius of the keplerian rotating disk .",
    "the upper limit of the specific angular momentum at the small scale ( @xmath3 7 @xmath8 10@xmath11 km s@xmath7 pc ) is , however , much lower than the measured specific angular momenta at radii of 1000 au ( @xmath3 5.4 @xmath8 10@xmath58 km s@xmath7 pc ) and 20000 au ( @xmath3 4.6 @xmath8 10@xmath55 km s@xmath7 pc ) @xcite . if the angular momentum is conserved from large to small scales , the material falling from a radius of 20000 au should rotate at a velocity of 2.8 km s@xmath7 at a radius of 370 au , which is 70 times larger than the upper limit of the rotational velocity estimated using the present observations .",
    "these results show that the rotational motion in the envelope around b335 is spinning - down toward the inner radii .",
    "this decrease in the specific angular momentum from large to small scales has also been found in other protostellar sources and nh@xmath101 cores by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the specific angular momentum in b335 at a radius @xmath18 20000 au is similar to that of the nh@xmath101 cores , however , the specific angular momentum on the hundred - au scale in b335 is one order of magnitude smaller than that in other protostellar sources ( see table 5 ) .",
    "this lower specific angular momentum on the small scale could be explained by evolutional effects as follows .",
    "a study of velocity gradients in nh@xmath101 cores by @xcite has shown that the specific angular momentum is larger at a larger radius ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) .",

    "hence , the specific angular momentum on the hundred - au scale in b335 could be still small .    to test this scenario",
    ", we estimate the size of the dynamical - infalling region and the maximum amount of the specific angular momentum carried in by the dynamical infall . based on single - dish observations of the envelope around b335 in c@xmath2o ( 10 ) emission by @xcite and the core rotation profile found by @xcite",
    ", we assume that the initial condition of the core in b335 is a sphere with a rotation profile @xmath103 @xmath104 , a density profile @xmath103 @xmath24 , a total mass of 2.4 @xmath10 , and a core radius of 20000 au .",
    "our sma observation shows that the total mass of the region within a radius of 370 au is @xmath3 0.1 @xmath10 ( envelope + protostar ) .",
    "this amount of material was originally enclosed within a radius of 940 au in the initial core . at this 940 au radius",
    ", the initial core has a specific angular momentum of @xmath3 3.5 @xmath8 10@xmath11 km s@xmath7 pc .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum which has been carried in during the inside - out collapse is consistent with our upper limit for the angular momentum in the inner region .",
    "moreover , the time scale of the propagation of the expansion wave to this 940 au radius is @xmath3 2.2 @xmath8 10@xmath74 years , on the assumption of the sound speed of 0.2 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this time scale is smaller than typical class 0 lifetime ( 1.7 @xmath105 0.3 @xmath8 10@xmath106 yr ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the small angular momentum in the inner region in b335 can be explained by the early phase of the inside - out collapse , and the material with larger angular momenta at the outer part has not yet fallen in and accumulated in the inner region .    for this scenario",
    ", we expect that as the expansion wave propagates outward , a larger amount of the angular momentum will be carried in and accumulated into inner region , resulting in a larger radius of the keplerian disk . in table 5",
    ", we compare the radius of the ( inferred ) centrifugally - supported , keplerian disk around class 0 , i , and ii sources .",
    "the sources associated with the observable large - scale keplerian disks ( @xmath77 @xmath18 400 au ) , gg tau , dm tau , and lkca15 , are in the most evolved stage ( class ii ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the sources in younger evolutional stages ( class i and 0 ) , such as l1551 irs5 , l1527 , hh 212 , and hh211 , have a smaller inferred radius for the keplerian disk compared to those around the class ii sources .",

    "nevertheless , jets around these class 0 and i sources suggests that it is most likely for them to be associated with keplerian disks ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "we also note that although hl tau is classified as a class ii source , it is associated with the infalling material , suggesting that it is actually a class i source . among these sources",
    ", b335 has the smallest inferred keplerian radius .",
    "this result may suggest that the keplerian disk radius could increase with evolution of the inside - out collapse scenario @xcite .",

    "<S> we have performed detailed imaging and analyses of sma observations in 230 ghz continuum , @xmath0co ( 21 ) , @xmath1co ( 21 ) , and c@xmath2o ( 21 ) emission toward b335 , an isolated and nearby ( @xmath3 150 pc ) bok globule with an embedded class 0 source ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report the first discover of high - velocity ( @xmath6 160 km s@xmath7 ) @xmath0co ( 21 ) jets with a size of @xmath3 900 au @xmath8 1500 au along the e - w direction in b335 . the estimated mass - loss rate ( @xmath3 2.3 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10 yr@xmath7 ) and the momentum flux ( @xmath3 3.7 @xmath8 10@xmath11 @xmath10 yr@xmath7 km s@xmath7 ) of the @xmath0co jets in b335 are one order of magnitude lower than those of other @xmath0co jets in more luminous sources such as hh 211 ( @xmath12 @xmath5 ) and hh 212 ( @xmath13 @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weaker jet activity in b335 could be due to the lower active accretion onto the central protostar . </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath2o emission shows a compact ( @xmath3 1500 au ) condensation associated with the central protostar , and it likely traces the protostellar envelope around b335 , as in the case of the 230 ghz continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> the envelope exhibits a velocity gradient from the east ( blueshifted ) to west ( redshifted ) that can be interpreted as an infalling motion . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated central stellar mass , the mass infalling rate , and the accretion luminosity are 0.04 @xmath10 , 6.9 @xmath8 10@xmath14 @xmath10 yr@xmath7 , and 2.1 @xmath5 , respectively . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there is no clear velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis in the c@xmath2o envelope , suggesting little envelope rotation on a hundred - au scale . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limits of the rotational velocity and specific angular momentum were estimated to be 0.04 km s@xmath7 and 7.0 @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> 10@xmath11 km s@xmath7 pc at a radius of 370 au , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the specific angular momentum and the inferred keplerian radius ( @xmath3 6 au ) in b335 are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those in other more - evolved sources . possible scenarios to explain the lower specific angular momentum in b335 are discussed . </S>"
