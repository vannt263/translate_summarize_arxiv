    "in the classic broadcast scenario the receivers decode their messages independently of each other .",
    "however , the increasing interest in networking motivates the consideration of broadcast scenarios in which each node in the network , besides decoding its own information , tries to help other nodes in decoding .",
    "this problem comes up naturally in sensor networks , where a transmitter external to the sensor network wants to download data into the network , e.g. , to configure the sensor array .",
    "the concept of cooperation among receivers is also relevant to general ad - hoc networks , since such cooperation provides a method for increasing the rates without increasing the spectrum allocation .",
    "therefore , this motivates the study of the effect of receiver cooperation on the rates for the broadcast channel .",
    "the broadcast channel was introduced by cover in  @xcite . following this initial work",
    ", bergmans proved an achievability result for the degraded bc ,  @xcite , and also a partial converse that holds only for the gaussian broadcast channel  @xcite ; in  @xcite gallager established a converse that holds for any discrete memoryless degraded broadcast channel . in @xcite el - gamal generalized the capacity result for the degraded broadcast channel to the  more capable \" case , and in @xcite and @xcite he showed that feedback does not increase the capacity region for the physically degraded case .",
    "several other classes of broadcast channels were studied in the following years .",
    "for example , the sum and product of two degraded broadcast channels were considered in @xcite , and in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite the deterministic broadcast channel was analyzed .    for the general broadcast channel",
    ", cover derived an achievable rate region for the case of two independent senders in @xcite . in @xcite korner and marton considered the capacity of general broadcast channels with degraded message sets .",
    "the best achievable region and the best upper bound for the two independent senders case were derived by marton in  @xcite , and a simple proof of marton s achievable region appeared later in  @xcite .",
    "another upper bound for the general broadcast channel , the so - called degraded , same - marginals ( dsm ) bound , was presented in @xcite .",
    "this bound is weaker than the upper bound in @xcite but stronger than sato s upper bound previously presented in @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that while marton s upper bound is the strongest , it is valid only for the two - receiver case , while sato s bound and the dsm bound can be extended to more than two receivers .",
    "the effect of feedback on the capacity of the gaussian broadcast channel was studied in @xcite and @xcite , and in @xcite the case of correlated sources was considered . a survey on the topic , with extensive references to previous work , can be found in @xcite . in recent years",
    "the multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) gaussian broadcast channel has attracted a lot of attention . initially , the sum - rate capacity was characterized in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and finally , in @xcite the capacity region was obtained .    none of the early work on the dmbc considered _ direct _ cooperation between the receivers .    in the cooperative broadcast scenario ,",
    "a single transmitter sends two messages to two receivers encoded in a single channel codeword @xmath0 , where the superscript @xmath1 denotes the length of a vector .",
    "each of the receivers gets a noisy version of the codeword , @xmath2 at @xmath3 and @xmath4 at @xmath5 . after reception , the receivers exchange messages over noiseless conference links of finite capacities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as depicted in figure [ fig : broadcast - cooperation - twousers ]",
    "the conference messages are , in general , functions of @xmath2 ( at @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 ( at @xmath5 ) , and the previous messages received from the other decoder .",
    "after conferencing , each receiver decodes its own message .",
    "we note that in a recent work ,  @xcite , the authors consider the problem of interactive decoding of a single broadcast message over the independent broadcast channel by a group of cooperating users . in our work",
    "we extend this scenario to the general channel and also consider the two independent senders  case .      the scenario in which one transceiver helps a second transceiver in decoding",
    "a message is clearly a _ relay _ scenario .",
    "hence , cooperative broadcast can be viewed as a generalization of the broadcast and relay scenarios into a hybrid broadcast / relay system , which better describes future communication networks .",
    "scenarios of this type have attracted considerable attention recently both from the practical and the theoretical aspects . from the practical aspect ,",
    "new protocols are proposed for the collaborative broadcast scenario .",
    "for example in @xcite the authors present a protocol for collaborative decision making involving broadcasting and relaying . from the theoretical aspect",
    ", there is a considerable effort invested in characterizing the capacity of an entire network .",
    "this work started with @xcite and recent results appear in @xcite and the following work @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work focuses on the gaussian case .",
    "a complementing approach for studying the performance of a network is to combine the basic building blocks of a network , namely multiple access , relaying and broadcasting and study the capacity of these combinations .",
    "the recent work on relaying focuses on extending the single relay results derived in @xcite to the mimo case ( see for example @xcite ) and to the multiple level case @xcite , @xcite . another recent result was introduced in @xcite where joint decoding was applied to the combined decode - and - forward and estimate - and - forward scheme of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) .",
    "a third approach for studying the performance of an entire network is the network coding approach sparked by the work of @xcite , which focuses on encoding at the nodes for maximizing the network throughput , separately from the channel coding .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the combination of broadcast and relay .",
    "a relevant work in this context is @xcite , in which the capacity of a class of independent relay channels with noiseless relay is derived .",
    "note that the case of noiseless relay is also related to the wyner - ziv problem @xcite .",
    "this relationship will be highlighted in the sequel .",
    "lastly , we note that a recent work , @xcite , presented an achievability result for the general dmbc with a single wireless cooperation channel from one receiver to the second receiver .",
    "this achievable rate region is shown to be the capacity region for the physically degraded broadcast / relay channel .      in the following",
    "we summarize the main contributions of this work .",
    "* we initially study a special case of the general setup formulated in section  [ sec : generalbcintro ] : the case of the physically degraded broadcast channel .",
    "although the physically degraded bc is of little practical interest , it is useful in developing the coding concept for the general bc with cooperation . for the physically degraded bc , we present both an achievability result and a converse .",
    "together , these two results give the capacity region for this setup .",
    "furthermore , this new region is shown to be a strict enlargement of the classical region without cooperation  @xcite . *",
    "next , we give an achievability result for the general bc with cooperating receivers .",
    "this region is also greater , in general , than the classic achievable region given in  @xcite for the broadcast channel .",
    "* we also consider the case where a single common message is transmitted to both receivers .",
    "we consider two different cooperation strategies and derive the achievable rates for each of them .",
    "we also derive an upper bound on the achievable rates for this scenario . here",
    "we provide results that explicitly link the available cooperation capacity to the increase in the rate of information .",
    "lastly , we show that for a special case of the general bc , namely when one channel is distinctly better than the other , the upper and lower bounds coincide , resulting in the capacity for that case .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : defs ] we define the mathematical framework . in section  [ sec : degraded ] we analyze the physically degraded bc , and derive the capacity region for that case , and in section  [ sec : generalbc ] we present an achievability result for the general broadcast channel with cooperating receivers .",
    "next , section [ sec : commonmsg ] presents achievability results and an upper bound on the rates for the case where only a single common message is transmitted .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "first , a word about notation : in the following we use @xmath8 to denote the entropy of a discrete random variable ( rv ) , and @xmath9 to denote the mutual information between two discrete random variables , as defined in ( * ? ? ?",

    "memoryless_.    the _ physically degraded broadcast channel _ is a broadcast channel in which the probability transition function can be decomposed as @xmath29 .",

    "we consider only conferences in which each receiver sends at most one message to the other receiver .",
    "note that there are cases where a single conference message is enough to achieve capacity : for example , in section [ sec : degraded ] a single conference step achieves capacity for the physically degraded broadcast channel , and in @xcite a single conference step achieves capacity for the discrete memoryless multiple access channel counterpart of the setup discussed here .",
