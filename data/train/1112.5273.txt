    "it is well known that the elastic scattering spectrum contains rich morphological information about the biological tissue samples due to the inhomogeneity of the constituent organelles sizes@xcite .",

    "we restrict ourselves to a single wavelength in order to observe the refractive index fluctuation at a particular wavelength .",
    "the use of the wavelet based multi - fractal de - trended fluctuation analysis ( wbmfdfa ) allows the use of the multi resolution analysis ( mra ) capability of the wavelet transforms to isolate trends of different polynomial orders .",
    "this is particularly helpful in the context of inhomogeneous size distribution of scatterers in a biological sample .",
    "this method has been used in various contexts like determining the multi - fractality in light scattering spectra for pre - cancer detection@xcite and studying tissue multi - fractality through phase contrast microscopy@xcite . here",

    "the multi - fractality is characterized by a described by a spectrum of exponents instead of a single exponent . in the next subsection , we will briefly review the multi - fractal analysis through wavelet based fluctuation analysis .",
    "the question of multi - fractal signals has been studied by stanley and his co workers extensively though the multi - fractal de - trended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa)@xcite . the wavelet based multi - fractal de - trended fluctuation analysis ( wbmfdfa ) proposed by manimaran _",
    "@xcite used the multi - resolution analysis capability of the wavelet transforms to perform the de - trending of the signals . in this method",

    "subsequently , we calculate the profile of the series through @xmath24 we use this profile series to extract the fluctuations through discrete wavelet transform .",
    "the fluctuation extraction involves a wavelet decomposition using the db4 wavelet which has a support width of 7 and 8 filters@xcite .",
    "the profile series can be decomposed as @xmath25 where , @xmath26 is the mother wavelet db4 and @xmath27 is the father wavelet such that it is orthogonal to the mother wavelet .",

    "the profile is reconstructed at a particular level @xmath30 by taking only the low pass coefficients to extract the trend at level @xmath30 .",
    "this trend is subtract from the profile to obtain the fluctuations at each scale .",

    "however , the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath43 does not make it the ideal parameter for the characterization of multi - fractality @xcite and hence a more sophisticated function called the singularity spectrum is required .",

    "the inhomogeneity of the tissue micro - structure due to the presence of various organelles with various refractive indices can be easily observed in the figures .",
    "we use the fourier analysis and the wbmfdfa in order to probe the refractive index variations associated with the structural changes occurring in the course of disease progression .",
    "the fourier power law analysis is based on the mono - fractal hypothesis and proffers the power law exponent @xmath14 which is related to the hurst exponent @xmath49 by @xmath50 .",
    "the fourier power in this case is a function of the spatial frequency .",

    "we observe that the mean absolute @xmath14 for the epithelium ( stroma ) is @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for the healthy case while it is @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) for the dysplatic case .",
    "this power law behavior in the spatial frequency domain can be attributed to the inhomogeneous size distribution of the scatterers in the tissue micro - structure . however , this power law exponent is not independent of the scale as has been observed in the case of the phase contrast microscopy@xcite and implies the multi - fractal nature of the scatterer composition of the tissues .    in terms of distinguishing different stages of cancer , as compared to the results obtained in the analysis of the phase contrast microscopic images ( where the whole visible spectral region ( @xmath55nm-@xmath56 nm ) is used as opposed to this method where a monochromatic image at @xmath57 nm is used ) ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath14 is lower .",
    "nevertheless , the trend of @xmath14 for dysplastic samples being lower than that of the healthy samples is corroborated at the @xmath57 nm wavelength .",
    "as expected , the @xmath14 for the epithelium @xmath58 is higher than that of the stroma @xmath59 .",

    "a comparison of the mean values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 for health and dysplastic tissues is given in table ( [ tab : tab_param ] ) . to further verify this and to analyze the multi - fractal nature of the tissues",

    "in conclusion , we have compared the normal and dysplastic human cervical epithelium and stroma in an effort to probe the differences between their multi - fractality towards developing a possible non - invasive optical technique for cancer detection .",
    "the use of monochromatic imagery for this purpose provides us information about the micro - structural changes in the tissues associated with disease progression .",
    "we observe that the multi - fractality of tissues decreases with progression of cancer . though the @xmath14 or @xmath68 are not drastically different , the trend of decreasing multi - fractality through the progression is sufficient to quantify the stage of cancer .",
    "for example , the decreasing @xmath14 shows that the as the cancer progresses , the tissue micro - structure goes from @xmath77 towards a flatter power spectrum .",
    "similarly , the hurst exponents show that with the increase in the cancer grades , the structural organization goes from a seemingly more random behavior to a spatially long term correlated behavior .",
    "the decreasing @xmath68 implies the decrease in multi - fractality with the disease progression .",
    "this work is a proof of concept about the exploration of monochromatic laser imagery to understand the variations of the tissue micro - structure when observed at a particular wavelength as compared to phase contrast microscopy where the whole visible range is used .",
    "however , we believe that due to the presence of various fluorescing enzymes in the cancerous tissues like nad@xmath78 , the response of the tissues to different wavelengths would be different and a more extensive study of the same is being undertaken which will be reported soon .",
