    "@xcite twenty years ago , three - body models of deuteron - induced reactions became important since the early studies of stripping theory  @xcite , where  the internal coordinates of the target nucleus are ignored and the only dynamically active variables are the coordinates , relative to the target nucleus , of the interacting nucleon that is captured by the nucleus and the spectator nucleon that goes on to the detector \" .",
    "the present work goes back in time , recaptures the three - body concept of direct nuclear reactions that is common to continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) calculations  @xcite and shows the results obtained by solving faddeev / alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations  @xcite for elastic , transfer and breakup reactions where three - body dynamics plays a dominant role . in this work",
    "we attempt to calculate all observables using dynamical models based on energy - independent or energy - dependent optical potentials for the nucleon - nucleus interaction  @xcite and realistic neutron - proton @xmath4 potentials such as cd - bonn  @xcite .",
    "some examples are shown for reactions initiated by deuterons on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as protons on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "although the use of energy - dependent potentials in three - body calculations is not free of theoretical problems that are discussed below , the results we show demonstrate the possibilities and the shortcomings of this model ; this is , above all , the aim of the present paper . in addition",
    "we present the exact derivation of an alternative set of equations that may serve as the basis for future investigations on improving approximate methods in nuclear reaction theory .    although deuteron - nucleus three - body models , including striping or pick up , have already been explored in the past in the framework of faddeev / ags equations starting with the pioneer work of aaron and shanley  @xcite to the more recent calculations of alt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , all of them were drastically simplified . in most cases",
    "separable interactions were used between pairs and the correct treatment of the coulomb interaction was missing .",
    "this situation has now changed due to the recent progress in the description of proton - deuteron elastic scattering and breakup  @xcite where the coulomb repulsion is fully included using the method of screening and renormalization @xcite together with realistic nuclear potentials .",
    "this technical development was applied to three - body nuclear reactions to test the accuracy of the cdcc method  @xcite and the convergence of the multiple scattering series in the framework of the glauber approximation  @xcite and distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia )  @xcite which are standard approximations used to describe nuclear reaction data .",
    "some of the interaction models employed in this work and in cdcc calculations are formally identical , but instead of solving the three - body schrdinger equation in coordinate space using a representation in terms of a set of eigenstates pertaining to a given subsystem hamiltonian , we solve the faddeev / ags equations in momentum space and obtain numerically well converged solution of the three - body problem for all reactions allowed by the chosen interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we benchmarked the two methods and concluded that cdcc is indeed a reliable method to calculate deuteron - nucleus elastic and breakup cross sections , but may not provide a sufficiently accurate solution of the three - body problem for transfer and breakup in one - neutron halo nucleus scattering from a proton target such as @xmath5 reactions . in those cases",
    "the comparison of cdcc results with experimental data may be misleading .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:3beq ] we recall the faddeev / ags equations , in sec .  [ sec : tdm ] we present the results for three dynamical models , and in sec .  [ sec : dwe ] we compare them with the results of standard approximations used in nuclear reaction theory .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "let s consider a system of three particles @xmath6 with kinetic energy operator @xmath7 , interacting by means of two - body potentials @xmath8 ( @xmath9 in the standard odd - man - out notation ) .",
    "the full resolvent @xmath10 and the channel resolvent @xmath11 may be related through the ags transition operator @xmath12 as @xmath13 the transition operator @xmath12 satisfies the ags equation @xcite @xmath14 where the summation on @xmath15 runs from one to three , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the free resolvent , and @xmath18 is the two - body transition matrix ( t - matrix ) that obeys the lippmann - schwinger equation for pair @xmath19 , @xmath20 at a given energy @xmath21 in the three - body center of mass @xmath22 system the on - shell matrix elements @xmath23 calculated between the appropriate channel states yield all the relevant elastic , inelastic and transfer @xmath24 as well as breakup @xmath25 amplitudes .",
    "the channel state @xmath26 for @xmath27 is the eigenstate of the corresponding channel hamiltonian @xmath28 with the energy eigenvalue @xmath21 made up by the bound state wave function for pair @xmath19 times a relative plane wave between particle @xmath19 and pair @xmath19 . for breakup",
    "the final state is a product of two plane waves corresponding to the relative motion of three free particles .",
    "the ags equations are faddeev - like equations with compact kernel and therefore suitable for numerical solution ; they are consistent with the corresponding schrdinger equation and therefore provide exact description of the quantum three - body problem .",
    "after partial wave decomposition eq",
    ".   becomes a two variable integral equation which we solve by standard discretization of momentum variables and summation of the multiple scattering series by pad method ; more details can be found in refs .",
    "as in all numerical calculations convergence of results has to be tested vis -  - vis number of included partial waves , mesh points and pad steps .    to include the coulomb interaction between two charged particles we use the method of screening and renormalization @xcite .",
    "the coulomb potential is screened , standard scattering theory for short - range potentials is used in the form of eq .   with parametric dependence on the screening radius @xmath29 , and the renormalization procedure",
    "is applied to obtain @xmath29-independent results for sufficiently large @xmath29 , that correspond to the unscreened limit .",
    "a complete review on this subject is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite together with a number of practical applications .",
    "in this section we set the three - body dynamics we apply to study all the reactions initiated by deuterons on @xmath0 and @xmath30 as well as protons on @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath0 and @xmath30 are considered as inert cores .",
    "although in most nuclear reaction calculations the deuteron wave function is generated through a gaussian potential fitted to the deuteron binding energy , which is then used to drive the @xmath33 interaction in all other partial waves , we use the cd - bonn  @xcite potential as our realistic interaction for all @xmath33 partial waves including the deuteron channel .",
    "for the neutron - nucleus @xmath34 and proton - nucleus @xmath35 interactions we use the optical potentials of watson  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which are based on an optical model analysis of nucleon scattering from @xmath36-shell nuclei between 10 and 50 mev ; the nucleus @xmath37 is a structureless core of mass number @xmath37 . although core excitation may be treated in the present three - body models , we discard such possibility at this time .",
    "therefore the relevant parameters of this optical model fit are both energy and mass dependent and are fitted to the existing data over the energy and mass range . for specific nuclei and energy , one could perhaps obtain a better fit but , as mentioned in the introduction , our goal is to explore the possibilities of a three - body model that can simultaneously describe all reactions allowed by the chosen interactions and leave the fine tuning for an improved model study . in all calculations nucleons",
    "are considered as spin @xmath38 particles and the nuclear cores as spin zero particles ; the spin - orbit terms of the optical potentials are included as well as the full operator structure of the cd - bonn potential for the @xmath39 pair .",
    "the calculations include @xmath39 partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath40 , @xmath41 partial waves with orbital angular momentum @xmath42 , and @xmath43 partial waves with @xmath44 ; the total three - particle angular momentum is @xmath45 .",
    "depending on the reaction and energy , some of these quantum numbers cutoffs can be safely chosen significantly lower , leading , nevertheless , to well converged results .",
    "the @xmath43 channel is more demanding than the @xmath41 channel due to the screened coulomb force , where the screening radius @xmath46 fm for the short - range part of the scattering amplitude is sufficient for convergence .",
    "the only exception are reactions leading to a final @xmath47 bound state where @xmath48 fm and a sharper screening is needed . with the above choice of the calculational parameters we obtain well converged results for all considered observables such that all discrepancies with the experimental data can be attributed solely to the shortcomings of the interaction models that are used .",
    "in this case we use the traditional approach based on energy - independent optical potentials whose parameters are chosen at a fixed energy . for deuteron scattering from nucleus @xmath37 the parameters for the @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath43 potentials are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite at half the lab energy of the deuteron projectile .",
    "for proton scattering from the @xmath49 nucleus the @xmath43 parameters are taken from ref .",

    "the two - body t - matrix given by eq .   enters the faddeev / ags equation for the transition operator @xmath12 .",
    "even if the potential is energy independent , the pair t - matrix has to be calculated at the two - body energies @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the relative momentum between particle @xmath19 and the @xmath77 of pair @xmath19 that has to be integrated over when solving the faddeev / ags equation , @xmath78 is the corresponding particle - pair @xmath19 reduced mass , and @xmath21 is three - body energy in the @xmath77 system . therefore in three - body calculations the particles in all pairs scatter at two - body energies between @xmath21 and @xmath79 . in the case of the cd - bonn potential @xmath39 observables are described with @xmath80 from zero @xmath39 relative energy to the @xmath81 production threshold . the same",
    "can not be said about the @xmath41 and @xmath43 optical potentials which in the previous model were chosen at a fixed energy .",
    "hence they describe the corresponding data at that energy but not over the broader range that is relevant for the solution of the three - body faddeev / ags equation .    in the present model",
    "we take the full energy dependence of the optical potential such that when @xmath41 or @xmath43 pairs interact at a given positive relative energy , the used parameters of the optical potential fit elastic @xmath41 and @xmath43 scattering at that energy .",
    "in addition , when the energy becomes negative the corresponding potentials become real , energy - independent and support a number of bound states that correspond to the ground and excited states of the @xmath49 and @xmath47 nucleus whereas the pauli forbidden states are removed . as mentioned before ,",
    "the parameters of the energy - dependent optical potentials are slightly modified to obtain the experimental binding energies at zero energy as indicated in table  [ tab : v ] for both @xmath41 or @xmath43 potentials in given partial waves .",
    "in addition , the binding energy of the pauli forbidden @xmath82 state in @xmath2 and @xmath83 systems is fitted to the @xmath0 neutron and proton separation energy , respectively , whereas the @xmath84 binding energy in @xmath3 and @xmath85 systems calculated with original parameters @xcite is close to the corresponding nucleon separation energies of @xmath1 . the resulting binding energies are given in table  [ tab : eb ] for @xmath2 , @xmath83 , @xmath3 , and @xmath85 nuclei .",
    "in the case of @xmath60-@xmath0 , where the adjusted parameters are quite different from the original ones , at positive energies @xmath86 is replaced by @xmath87 and @xmath88 is replaced by @xmath89 , such that the potential preserves the description of the @xmath60-@xmath0 scattering data in the desired energy regime and remains a continuous function of the energy .",
    "such a replacement is not needed in the case of @xmath60-@xmath1 where the adjusted parameters are very close to the original ones .",
    "using energy - dependent pair interactions in three - body calculations is by no means free of theoretical complications , such as the problem of non - orthogonality of three - body wave functions at different energies as a result of the absence of a hamiltonian theory for the scattering process .",
    "this issue can be easily understood even at the two - body level . if the potential is energy dependent the two - body bound states and scattering states are not necessarily orthogonal , much like scattering states corresponding to different energies .",
    "therefore completeness relations and three - particle unitarity may be at fault even in the presence of real interactions .",
    "nevertheless present optical model fits , in particular the one by watson  _ et al .",
    "_ , are rather weak in their energy dependence , as can be seen by the strength of the energy dependent coefficients vis -  - vis the energy independent parameters ; furthermore this energy dependence is smooth over the energy range of the fit except perhaps the @xmath60-@xmath0 spin - orbit interaction in p waves near @xmath90 .",
    "even in this case we tried a different p - wave interactions and the results are not very different as demonstrated in the appendix . for this reason we believe that the problems of non - orthogonality of wave functions and completeness may be sufficiently small to allow a serious consideration of this model given its notorious advantages such as consistent dynamics for both @xmath50 and @xmath53 scattering and the possibility to calculate transfer reactions to @xmath53 and @xmath91 final states .",
    "furthermore , one should keep in mind that the energy dependence and the imaginary part of the optical potential have the same origin ; they arise after the elimination of active degrees of freedom , i.e. , excitations , multiconfiguration mixing , and breakup of nucleus @xmath37 , from the considered hilbert space as described earlier by feshbach @xcite .",
    "however , in a three - body system this leads in addition to an effective energy - dependent complex three - body potential , or , in general , to many - body potentials ( up to @xmath92-body ) in an @xmath92-body system as formally developed by polyzou and redish @xcite in the framework of exact @xmath92-body theory .",
    "well known examples are the three- and four - nucleon systems described within the interaction model with energy - independent two - body potentials allowing for an explicit excitation of a nucleon to a @xmath93 isobar @xcite which yields effective energy - dependent two - nucleon and many - nucleon forces that are mutually consistent . in the study of three - nucleon observables it was found that the @xmath93-isobar effect of the two - nucleon nature is often overcompensated by the three - nucleon force effect .",
    "thus , also in the three - body nuclear reactions one could expect a similar situation for some observables , that is , a partial cancellation of the effects arising due to the energy dependence of the two - body potential and due to the three - body potential if the latter would be included in the calculations .",
    "however , when the energy dependence of the two - body optical potential is introduced in the usual phenomenological way , it is not clear at all what should be the consistent three - body potential .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to include an optical three - body potential in the present calculations , although such an extension of the faddeev / ags framework is possible .",
