    "there exist several experimental evidences supporting the fact that presence of entanglement is necessary for nonlocality of quantum correlations . but determining which entangled state reveals nonlocality(i.e . , violates bell inequality )",

    "any pure entangled state of two qubits violates bell - chsh inequality@xcite , the amount of violation being proportional to the degree of bipartite entanglement@xcite .",
    "however no such conclusion holds for mixed bipartite entangled states as there exists a class of mixed entangled states which admits a local hidden variable model and this class can not violate any bell inequality @xcite . till date nonlocality in two qubit systems has been explored in details .",
    "however multiqubit case is much more difficult to analyze .",
    "+ there is an increasing complexity while shifting from bipartite to multipartite systems .",
    "this is mainly because of the fact that multipartite entanglement has comparatively much complex and richer structure than that of bipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "so any study related to multipartite entanglement or dealing with multipartite nonlocality requires a deeper insight of the physics of many - particle systems which in general differ extensively from that of single or two party systems .",

    ", it is quite interesting to study the relationship between entanglement and nonlocality for multipartite system . to extend the two qubit relationship between entanglement and quantum nonlicality , one needs to classify both entanglement and nonlocality in multipartite system .",
    "in particular , entanglement of any tripartite state can either be biseparable or genuinely entangled @xcite .",
    "nonlocal character of a tripartite system can be categorized broadly in two categories of standard nonlocality and genuine nonlocality @xcite . in the former case , nonlocality is revealed in atleast one possible grouping of the parties whereas a state is said to be genuinely nonlocal if any possible grouping of parties reveal nonlocality . in @xcite",

    "see appendix ) with that of mermin inequality and the @xmath79-th facet inequality , we have observed that region of standard nonlocality , as detected by any of the remaining @xmath95 inequivalent facet inequalities forms subset of the region of standard nonlocality of mermin and the @xmath79-th facet inequality .",
    "so these two inequalities are the most efficient to detect standard nonlocality of this class of states .",

    "analogously genuine nonlocality of the class is discussed . for detection of genuine nonlocality",
    "@xmath106-th facet inequality and svetlichny inequality turn out to be the most effective tools .",
    "further comparison between these two inequalities points out that @xmath106-th facet inequality is even far better than svetlichny for some restricted subclasses of this class though the latter is extensively used for detection of genuine nonlocality .",
    "besides , our result illustrates the relationship between entanglement and nonlocality of this class of three qubit mixed states .",
    "interestingly no biseparable state is capable of revealing standard nonlocality .",
    "this in turn points out the necessity of genuine entanglement of this class for this purpose .",
    "however for revelation of standard nonlocality existence of genuine entanglement is not sufficient .",
    "this fact becomes clear from the existence of genuine entangled local subclass of ghz - symmetric states .",
    "it will be interesting to explore the presence of hidden nonlocality(if any ) @xcite of this class of states .",
    "also one may try to activate nonlocality of this class of states by using it in some suitable quantum network@xcite .",
