    "in the field of accelerator physics the request for cold beams , with low energy spread and emittance , is an important issue .",
    "the electron cooling technique , suggested by budker in 1966 , has been largely used for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the coexistence of positive ions and electrons leads to a certain amount of recombinations , and the study of this phenomenon has encountered a problem that is not completely solved up to now , i.e. the radiative recombination enhancement at low relative energy .    on the other hand , the nonextensive statistical mechanics has been successfully applied so far to various fields of physics , for instance in the study of astrophysical plasmas . here",
    "we show the possible application of generalized statistics to radiative recombination ; the results obtained go indeed into the right direction to account for the measured enhancement .    in the following sections we briefly summarize the electron cooling technique and radiative recombination , then propose the use of a superextensive distribution instead of a maxwellian function in the calculation of the recombination rate because of the presence of correlations and/or random and memory effects among the particles , and finally we present theoretical rates from an isotropic distribution .",
    "justifications and suggestions for experimental tests are also given to confirm the existence of a cut - off in the momentum distribution which , among all the generalized functions recently proposed , appears only in the tsallis distribution .",
    "liouville s theorem forbids the reduction of beam emittance by use of optical methods ; therefore , external dissipative forces must be applied in order to overcome this huge problem in devices like a storage ring , where the high number of cycles would result in a heavy beam quality loss . in 1966 ,",
    "budker suggested to overlap the beam of interest with a colder electron one , and to exploit coulomb scattering in order to carry away the energy excess in the hot ion component .",
    "shortly afterwards , devices built for this purpose proved the efficiency of the method .",
    "although their cross sections are orders of magnitude smaller , various phenomena can occur aside of coulomb elastic scattering , such as ion excitation , ionization and several atomic recombination mechanisms , among which lies the radiative recombination , @xmath0 where an electron goes from free to bound state , and the energy excess is released through x - rays .",
    "several experiments with bare ions ( three - body processes like dielectronic recombination are forbidden ) show an unexpected feature : when the relative velocity of electron - ion bunches approaches zero , the radiative recombination rate increases more than theoretically predicted on the basis of the calculated cross section and anisotropic maxwellian distribution  @xcite .",
    "the cross section of radiative recombination to any hydrogenic level with principal quantum number @xmath1 reads @xmath2\\ , , \\label{cross section n}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the rydberg energy , @xmath4 is the electron kinetic energy in the electron - ion center - of - mass frame and @xmath5 is the nuclear charge of the atom .",
    "a further quantum mechanical correction may be introduced via the so - called _ gaunt factor _ @xmath6 , that is convenient as there are parametrizations or tables for its values .",
    "the total cross section is obtained by summing the function in eq .",
    "[ cross section n ] over all the accessible values of @xmath1 ( often a proper upper limit @xmath7 is chosen ) ; furthermore , a suitable parametrization of the total cross section yields @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a function of @xmath11 evaluated numerically  @xcite .",
    "the recombination rate is then defined as an average of the cross section in eq .",
    "[ total cross section ] either over the distribution functions of the two beams , or a distribution function of their relative velocity and , if we consider an already cooled ion beam , we can reduce ourselves to the average over the electron distribution @xmath12 alone ; thus , the definition becomes @xmath13    usually , an anisotropic maxwellian distribution is considered : in the transverse plane the function is isotropic , whereas longitudinally the width ( temperature ) of the distribution is different .",
    "the distribution then reads @xmath14\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{mv_{\\bot}^{2}}{kt_{\\bot}}\\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the relative velocity ( energy ) of the two bunches of particles ( electrons and ions ) .",
    "the two temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the typical parameters defining the experimental conditions ; their values are around tens of mev for @xmath18 ( strongly determined by the voltage at which the thermocathode that produces the electron cloud operates ) and two or three orders of magnitude lower for @xmath17 .",
    "a clear example of recombination enhancement ( showing a value up to @xmath19 at zero relative energy ) is the experiment with @xmath20 ions , performed in the esr at gsi  @xcite .",
    "experiment performed at gsi ( picture taken from ref .",
    "@xcite).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    there are various interpretations of the enhancement : for the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , energy , due to the presence of a magnetic field , is transferred from the longitudinal to the transverse motion and therefore there is an increase in the time spent by the electron in proximity to the ion , enhancing the recombination probability .",
    "furthermore , a work by heerlein , zwicknagel and toepffer  @xcite takes into account the effect of the external fields , considered as the cause of enhancement , suggesting that this arises from a field - driven process , i.e. electrons that acquire negative energy upon the merging of the electron and ion beams , because of the presence of the toroidal magnetic field that permits the bending of the cooling electrons onto the trajectory of the ion beam ; the magnet separates the loosely bound electrons of the most outer atomic levels , so that these can yield an additional recombination channel ; hence , we have to count not only free - bound transitions , but also bound - bound transitions .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for criticisms to this explanation .",
    "so far , no complete theory has been proposed , anyway , and scaling laws for the enhancement require fitting upon experimental data ; on the contrary , we suggest an alternative approach based on a self - consistent thermostatistical framework , namely the nonextensive statistical mechanics , where the key idea is the use of a deformed distribution function .",
    "the nonextensive statistical mechanics , introduced by tsallis in the last two decades , can be seen as a generalization of maxwell - boltzmann statistics ; the tsallis distribution function reads @xmath21^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the nonextensivity index , @xmath23 is the normalization factor and @xmath24 is the @xmath22-temperature , that must be used every time we want to relate boltzmann and tsallis statistics  @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of the @xmath22-distribution is that when @xmath25 ( subextensivity and superdiffusion ) , @xmath26 shows a lower peak at @xmath27 with respect to the maxwellian function @xmath28 , while the tail at higher velocities is increased ; for @xmath29 ( superextensivity and subdiffusion ) , the situation is the other way round : @xmath26 is higher - peaked and narrower , so that the high - velocity tail is accordingly depleted , and a cut - off appears at @xmath30 .",
    "since the radiative recombination cross section shows a peak for @xmath31 , while the particles in the tail have scarcely an influence , a superextensive distribution , increasing the number of particles around the zero - energy point , leads to an increase in @xmath32 .",
    "this is calculated according to the following formula : @xmath33    expressing velocity @xmath34 as function of the kinetic energy @xmath4 , and using some analytical properties , we obtain from eq .",
    "[ non - extensive rate ] , @xmath35^{\\frac{q}{\\left(1-q\\right)}}\\sigma_{tot}\\left(e_{k}\\right)e_{k}\\ , , \\ ] ] where the integration limits are @xmath36 for @xmath25 , or @xmath37 for @xmath29 .",
    "two important remarks : first , we adopted an isotropic distribution function because the @xmath22-distribution can not be rigorously factorized ; therefore , coherently , we shall compare it with an @xmath38 obtained as a result of an isotropic maxwellian . inserting the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , we get the recombination enhancement at zero relative energy , defined as the ratio @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ ratio figure ] we plot the ratio @xmath40 as a function of the dimensionless temperature @xmath41 in the case of an electron - positron system .",
    "the curve shows that actually , as @xmath42 , a recombination enhancement appears .",
    "second , our calculations show that the recombination rate is almost the same for both maxwellian and tsallis distribution functions at the same temperature ; the major influence on the enhancement is therefore the temperature alteration given by @xmath22 in the @xmath43 definition .     against the dimensionless temperature @xmath44 for different values of the @xmath22 parameter in the superextensivity interval , ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "( calculations performed for an electron - positron system).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "many studies demonstrated that there exists a set of non - maxwellian distribution functions that are stationary solutions of dynamical equations  @xcite .",
    "for example , when a statistical system of particles is subjected to external random forces or electric fields ( condition that also applies to radiative recombination in electron cooling devices ) the actual functional dependence on energy of its distribution function relies strongly on the microscopical interaction acting among the ions .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that an interaction cross section roughly constant with energy naturally leads to the tsallis distribution that was used throughout this paper  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of a cut - off in a distribution function is not a completely new feature : already in 1940 , spitzer imposed a cut - off to the maxwellian distribution in order to explain the stability of galaxy clusters despite the escape velocity effect  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a theoretical explanation of the cut - off was given by relating it to a finite heat reservoir  @xcite .",
    "many experimental results show how the rate coefficient behaves as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "among others , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath20 ion beams have been used  @xcite .",
    "all experiments indicate that , respect to @xmath47 , the rate coefficient decreases much faster than the maxwellian one calculated at a temperature @xmath51 lower than the maxwellian @xmath52 , in spite of the fact that at @xmath53 the maxwellian rate at @xmath51 satisfactorily approximates the experimental result . only imposing a cut - off in the momentum distribution",
    "we can reproduce , for @xmath54 , the experimental behaviour ( see fig .",
    "[ enhancement figure ] ) .",
    "the previous argument actually represents an effective test that a cut - off naturally exists in the momentum distribution .    a further possible test to verify",
    "the presence of a superextensive distribution would be the observation of the recombination x - ray spectrum . a measured cut - off energy @xmath55 , beyond which there are no electrons ,",
    "would indeed imply the presence of a corresponding cut - off in the energy spectrum of the radiation emitted from recombination : the maximum observable energy might thus be @xmath56 since @xmath3 is the largest binding energy .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of the x - ray spectrum measurements , which could be possible in the future .",
    "but , since this kind of measurements are out of the present experimental efficiency , this remains a gedanken experiment .",
    "in order to explain the atomic recombination rate coefficient measured in electron cooling devices in storage rings ( of a factor up to 5 greater than its maxwellian evaluation ) we must consider that correlations and memory effects in addition to dissipative and random effects in the electron gas impose , for its description , the use of a deformed momentum distribution function . the superextensive tsallis distribution seems to be appropriate , among many other different deformed distributions proposed , because , among other reasons , this distribution contains an energy cut - off we would expect as a consequence of our previous considerations .    the presence of cut - off results by examining the experimental measurements of the rate at relative energies different from the very low relative energy region . this fact is a test of the validity , in this particular situation , of the tsallis nonextensive thermostatistics .",
