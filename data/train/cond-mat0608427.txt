    "the hall effect has been continuously playing an important role in experimental condensed - matter research , mostly because the interpretation of hall measurements is rather simple in classical fermi systems @xcite .",
    "in such materials the hall coefficient is a remarkably robust property , which is unaffected by interactions and only depends upon the shape of the fermi surface and the sign of the charge carriers .",
    "deviations from this simple behavior are generally taken as evidence for the onset of strong correlations and a failure of the fermi - liquid ( fl ) paradigm @xcite .",
    "several authors have investigated the hall effect in threeand two - dimensional fl @xcite , but the question of the role of correlations in the hall effect for low - dimensional systems remains largely unexplored .    in most three - dimensional systems",

    "to probe further the consequences of correlations in these compounds , several groups have undertaken the challenging measurement of the hall coefficient @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the results , different depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field , proved difficult to interpret due to a lack of theoretical understanding of this problem .",
