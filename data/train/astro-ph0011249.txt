    "gamma ray burst grb990705 was detected on 1999 , july 5.66765 ut , by the bepposax gamma - ray burst monitor , and localized by the bepposax wide field camera ( celidonio et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "it was promptly noted ( djorgovski et al . , 1999 )",
    "that its position , in projection , corresponded to the outskirts of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and it was suggested that , if the burst was indeed located in the lmc or its halo , a search for a neutrino signal , coincident with , or just prior to the grb , would be quite interesting .    at the time of grb990705 , the lvd neutrino observatory , located in the gran sasso underground laboratory , italy , was regularly taking data , with active scintillator mass @xmath7 tons .",
    "the main purpose of the telescope is the search for neutrinos from gravitational stellar collapses in the galaxy . on july 19@xmath8 1999 , the result of a preliminary analysis of the lvd data recorded during 48 hours around the time of grb990705",
    "was reported ( fulgione , 1999 ) , and the absence of a neutrino signal , that would be expected from a gravitational stellar collapse in our galaxy , was established ( no additional results from other neutrino observatories were reported ) .",
    "the search for low - energy neutrinos possibly associated to grbs is indeed of interest , especially in view of the recent observational evidence linking ( some ) grbs and supernovae ( see , e.g. , galama et al .",
    ", 1998 , bloom et al . , 1999 ,",
    "reichart , 1999 ) .",
    "many recent widely discussed models of the sources of grbs involve the core collapse of massive stars ( see , e.g. , woosley , 1993 , paczynski , 1998 , mac fayden & woosley , 1999 , khokhlov et al . , 1999 ,",
    "wheeler et al . , 1999 ) : in this scenario the neutrino emission could be associated to the cooling phase of the collapsed object , the time separation between the neutrino and gamma signals depending on the time necessary to transfer energy from the central engine , which emits thermal @xmath4 , to the outer region , emitting high energy photons .",
    "it is clear that the possibility of detecting neutrinos correlated to grbs depends on the distance of the associated source : even if it appears established that most of them lie at cosmological distances ( metzger et al . , 1997 )",
    ", there is evidence , for at least one of grbs , to be related to a supernovae event in the local universe ( tinney et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , from the study of the afterglow of grb990705 ( masetti et al . , 2000 ) , although an extragalactic origin might be supported , the association with lmc can not be ruled out .",
    "consequently , a more careful analysis of the lvd data in correspondence of grb990705 has been performed , to search for weaker neutrino signals , not only in coincidence with , but also preceding - rays . ] and even shortly following it .",
    "the paper is planned as follows : in sect.2 we briefly describe the lvd detector , and we explain the structure of the data . in sect.3",
    "we present the results of the analysis : a search for a @xmath0 signal coincident in time with grb990705 has been performed .",
    "moreover , a time interval spanning from 24 hrs preceding the burst up to 10 minutes later , has been scanned , searching for any non - statistical fluctuation of the background .",
    "for sake of completeness , a wider interval , since 10 days before to 1 day after the event , has been investigated .",
    "we conclude in sect.4 , discussing the results in terms of upper limits to the @xmath9 flux possibly associated to the grb , under the hypothesis of thermal neutrino energy spectrum at the source , and comparing such limits with the expectations from existing models on @xmath4 emission from collapsing objects .",
    "the large volume detector ( lvd ) in the gran sasso underground laboratory , italy , consists of an array of 840 scintillator counters , 1.5 m@xmath10 each , interleaved by streamer tubes , arranged in a compact and modular geometry ( see aglietta et al . , 1992 , for a more detailed description ) , with an active scintillator mass @xmath11 tons .",
    "the experiment has been taking data , under different larger configurations , since 1991 ( at the time of grb990705 , the active mass was @xmath7 tons ) .",
    "the main purpose of the telescope is the detection of neutrinos from gravitational stellar collapses in the galaxy , mainly through the absorption interaction @xmath12 .",
    "this reaction is observed in lvd counters through two detectable signals : the prompt signal due to the @xmath13 ( detectable energy @xmath14 mev @xmath15 ) , followed , with a mean delay @xmath16 , by the signal from the @xmath17 capture ( @xmath18 mev ) .",
    "counters can be considered as divided into two subsets : external , i.e. those directly exposed to the rock radioactivity , which operate at energy threshold @xmath19 mev , and inner ( core ) , operating at @xmath20 mev .    in the search for antineutrino interactions ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "raw data are processed in order to reject muons , and filtered on the basis of the prompt pulse ( @xmath13 ) energy release and of the presence of delayed low energy signals ( n capture ) .",
    "we define three classes of data :    * class a : pulses with @xmath22 mev ( @xmath7 tons ) ; * class b : pulses with @xmath22 mev , followed by a delayed ( @xmath23 ) low energy pulse in the same counter ( @xmath7 tons ) ; * class c : pulses detected by core scintillators ( @xmath24 mev ) , followed by a delayed low energy pulse in the same counter ( @xmath25 tons ) .    the average efficiency for n detection is @xmath26 for the core and @xmath27 for the whole detector .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + tab.2 : upper limits ( 90% c.l . ) to the @xmath3 flux @xmath1 cross - section , at the earth , integrated over different time intervals .",
    "the search for a possible @xmath4 burst has been extended to from 24 hours before grb990705 occurrence to 10 minutes after , for a total time @xmath28 min .",
    "the interval of interest has been divided into @xmath29 intervals of duration @xmath30 , each one starting at the middle of the previous one .",
    "the multiplicity distributions of clusters ( number of events within each interval of duration @xmath30 ) have been studied for the three classes of data , defined in sect.2 , and for @xmath31,@xmath32 s , and they have been compared with the expectations from poissonian fluctuations of the background . in fig.[fig : l21 ] , we report , as an example , the result of the data analysis for class b events .",
    "the agreement between data and expectations confirms the detector stability , allowing to state that there is no evidence for any detectable @xmath4 signal during the considered period .    for sake of completeness",
    ", the same analysis has been applied to the data collected since 240 hours preceding the grb , up to 24 hrs later .",
    "also in this case , the data are in total agreement with the expectations from statistical fluctuations of the background .",
    "the number of expected @xmath3 interactions , @xmath33 , in a time interval @xmath30 , due to a pulsed @xmath3 emission , is defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the detection efficiency , @xmath36 [ ton ] is the active scintillator mass , @xmath37 is the number of free protons per scintillator ton , @xmath38 is the neutrino interaction cross section ( vogel , 1984 ) and @xmath39 is the differential neutrino flux at the earth . in the absence of any information on the source distance and its emission spectrum , we can express the results of the search in terms of upper limits to the flux @xmath1 cross - section , integrated over the time duration , at the earth : @xmath40 .      any hypothesis on the @xmath3 source spectrum leads to a limit to the time integrated @xmath3 flux at the earth .",
    "assuming a thermal spectrum , constant during the emission interval @xmath30 , i.e. : @xmath41 upper limits to the time integrated @xmath3 flux are obtained , as a function of the neutrinosphere emission temperature @xmath42 [ mev ] .",
    "these results are shown in fig.[fig : l2 ] , for burst duration @xmath43 s.    most theoretical models on the @xmath3 emission from gravitational stellar collapses ( burrows , 1992 ) predict that the neutron star binding energy , @xmath44 erg , is emitted in neutrinos of every flavour ( energy equipartition ) with thermal energy spectra , during a time interval @xmath45 s. the corresponding @xmath3 fluxes at the earth , calculated , under the approximation of isotropical emission and pure fermi - dirac spectrum , for two different source distances : @xmath46 kpc ( i.e. , corresponding to the lmc erg and a @xmath3 spectral temperature @xmath47 mev , the resulting @xmath3 flux at the earth , integrated over time , is @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 kpc ( i.e. , corresponding to the outskirts of our galaxy ) , are reported in fig.[fig : l2 ] and are compared with the results of the burst search .",
    "the occurrence of a gravitational stellar collapse , with @xmath9 emitted in the temperature range @xmath50 mev , can then be excluded within a region of radius @xmath51 kpc , in the case of time coincidence with the grb990705 event , and @xmath52 kpc , for the 24 hours preceding the grb time and @xmath53 , neutrino oscillation effects would lead to a hardening of the @xmath3 spectrum and , after all , to an increase of the @xmath3 detection probability .",
    "therefore , excluding oscillations into sterile neutrinos , the limits obtained in this work would remain valid even in the case of neutrino mixing . ] .",
    "the authors wish to thank the director and the staff of the national gran sasso laboratories for their constant and valuable support .",
    "w.f . and p.l.g .",
    "gratefully acknowledge a useful discussion with francesco vissani ."
