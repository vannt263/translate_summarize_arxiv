    "the theoretical study of properties of hadronic matter under extreme conditions allows to understand nuclear systems ranging from experimental heavy ion collisions @xcite to the astrophysical scenarios with objects such as neutron stars , where densities up to several times that of nuclear saturation are believed to exist in their inner core @xcite .",
    "the study of the low temperature behaviour of fermi liquids was pioneeringly addressed by landau @xcite and later developed by others in the fermi liquid theory ( flt ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea underlaying is that the properties of this type of normal quantum systems can be studied using the dynamics of quasiparticles close to the fermi surface .",
    "the inclusion of an additional magnetic field , @xmath1 , allows further testing the properties of magnetized fermi liquids since nucleons have a tiny , but not vanishing , magnetic moment .",
    "these degenerate plasmas are of interest in the description of matter in the inner shells of rapidly rotating neutron stars with very intense magnetic fields . in the catalog of the @xmath2 such objects",
    "there is now experimental indication that in a subgroup of pulsars , called _ magnetars _ , magnetic field strengths in the surface of the order @xmath3 g @xcite exist . in the formation of these objects , after a supernova core collapse , neutrinos are an important ingredient in the first stages of the cooling of the proto - neutron star @xcite",
    ". the interactions of ( anti ) neutrinos with matter determine the ratio of deposited energy that , in turn , affect the dynamics of the cooling afterwards .    as a first approach , and in most of the calculations , the modifications due to the induced spin polarization in nuclear systems under the presence of magnetic fields are discarded .",
    "for example , some works have calculated the matter response functions in absence of magnetic fields , first , for the pure neutron system @xcite or in the case where some proton population is included @xcite . for systems where a spin excess is postulated _ a priori _ some partial results",
    "have been obtained in the context of hartree - fock calculations as in @xcite . however , in these works there is no link between a magnetic field and the induced matter magnetization .    it has been argued that it is important to know whether a ferromagnetic transition takes place or not @xcite in nuclear systems at high densities and the impact of the spin polarization as a source of additional excitation modes in the magnetized plasma that , in turn , could affect the neutrino opacity in the nuclear medium .",
    "to describe the nuclear interaction , a diversity of models in the relativistic @xcite or phenomenological non - relativistic @xcite approximations have been considered .",
    "on the other hand , in the low density case , recent works show that the vector response seems to be relevant in the low density non - magnetized matter and direct simulations either using monte carlo or molecular dynamics techniques have been performed . at these low densities",
    "clustered pasta phases may develop  @xcite .    in an earlier work @xcite we showed that there are important modifications in the low and high density regimes , as magnetization of a neutron plasma",

    "magnetization amounts to values typically below @xmath5 for magnetic fields as high as @xmath6 g allowed by the scalar virial theorem and moderate temperatures .",
    "we have also calculated the influence of the generalized landau fermi liquid parameters @xcite on a set of observables in a magnetized neutron system @xcite .",
    "the present work performs a study of dynamical response functions for a magnetized neutron plasma and the effect of a strong magnetic field on the neutrino opacities in the two - component neutron fermi liquid , using skyrme effective nuclear interactions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ model ] , we describe the medium response under the linear approximation for the different parametrizations of the skyrme force used in the description of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction . using the landau fermi liquid theory at zero temperature we consider a multipolar expansion of the particle - hole ( ph ) interaction and",
    "analyze the linear response up to dipolar terms .",
    "we gauge the effects of finite density , presence of a strong external magnetic field and the induced spin polarization in the neutron system . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present the results obtained and finally summary and conclusions are given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we consider a homogeneous pure neutron system where each neutron has spin projection on the z - axis , @xmath7 .",
    "it can be either @xmath8 for spins aligned parallel to a uniform magnetic field that will be taken along the z - direction , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 for antiparallel spins .",
    "this system may be viewed as a two - component neutron fermi liquid where the relative populations of magnetized species vary as magnetic field and density change .",
    "although we restrict ourselves to neutron matter in this work , for application to astrophysical scenarios , i. e. , in neutron star matter @xcite beta equilibrium must be imposed and , subsequently , multi - component plasmas with leptons , protons and heavier baryons should be considered .",
    "the total baryonic density in our two - component neutron system is given by @xmath11 , being @xmath12 the @xmath7-polarized component at @xmath13 .",

    "the net magnetization density is @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the neutron magnetic moment in units of the nuclear magneton  @xcite .",

    ", the response function @xmath84 will provide information about the density - dependent in - medium correlations , partial polarization of the plasma , and vector and vector - axial contributions to the overall response of matter that may arise in the presence of a strong magnetic field when it is weakly probed by neutrinos .",
    "for example , in the neutral current reaction involving @xmath85 neutrinos , collectively @xmath86 , and their antiparticles , elastically scattering up ( down ) polarized neutrons , @xmath87 in the non - relativistic limit the differential cross section of neutrinos scattering off matter can be calculated from the linear response of the medium using @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the incoming and outgoing ( anti ) neutrino energies , respectively .",

    "once the response has been evaluated it is straightforward to evaluate the neutrino mean free paths in the medium using @xmath99 let us mention that , although the low temperature case in an astrophysical scenario arises after the early cooling neutrino phase , it is worth sizing the dependence of the neutrino opacity on medium effects , spin polarization and strong magnetic fields with respect to the non - magnetized case in an analogous way to the study of the ideal cases of isospin symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter evaluated before addressing the more realistic situation where different hadronic species in beta equilibrated matter arise .",
