    "the need to model , analyze and engineer large complex networks appears in a wide range of scientific disciplines , ranging from social sciences and biology to physics and engineering @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these networks are composed of relatively simple agents that interact locally with their neighbors based on a very limited knowledge about the system state . despite the simple local interactions",
    ", the resulting networks can display a rich set of emergent behaviors , including certain forms of intelligence and learning  @xcite .",
    "consensus problems , in which the aim is to compute a weighted average of the initial values held by a collection of nodes , play a fundamental role in the study of node dynamics over complex networks .",
    "early work @xcite focused on understanding how opinions evolve in a network of agents , and showed that a simple deterministic opinion update based on the mutual trust and the differences in belief between interacting agents could lead to global convergence of the beliefs .",
    "consensus dynamics has since then been widely adopted for describing opinion dynamics in social networks , e.g. , @xcite . in engineering sciences ,",
    "a huge amount of literature has studied these algorithms for distributed averaging , formation forming and load balancing between collaborative agents under fixed or time - varying interaction networks @xcite .",
    "randomized consensus seeking has also been widely studied , motivated by the random nature of interactions and updates in real complex networks  @xcite .",
    "interactions in large - scale networks are not always collaborative , as nodes often take on different , or even opposing , roles .",
    "a convenient framework for modeling different roles and relationships between agents is to use signed graphs .",
    "signed graphs were introduced in the classical work by heider in 1940s  @xcite to model the structure of social networks , where a positive link represents a friendly relation between two agents , and a negative link an unfriendly one . in @xcite ,",
    "a dynamic model based on a signed graph with positive links between nodes ( representing nations ) belonging to the same coalition and negative otherwise , was introduced to study the stability of world politics . in biology",
    ", sign patterns have been used to describe activator ",
    "inhibitor interactions between pairs of chemicals @xcite , neural networks for vision and learning @xcite , and gene regulatory networks  @xcite . in all these examples ,",
    "the state updates that happen when two nodes interact depend on the sign of the arc between the nodes in the underlying graph .",
    "the understanding of the emergent dynamical behaviors of networks with agents having different roles is much more limited than for instance collaborative agents performing consensus algorithms .",
    "it is intriguing to investigate what happens when two types of dynamics are coupled in a single network .",
    "naturally we ask : how we should model the dynamics of positive and negative interactions , when do behaviors such as consensus , swarming and clustering emerge , and how does the structure of the sign patterns influence these behaviors ? in this paper , we answer these questions for a general model of opinion formation in dynamic signed random networks .",
    "we consider general randomized node interactions .",
    "a sequence of deterministic signed graphs defines a dynamical environment of the network , and then random node interactions take place under independent , but not necessarily identically distributed , random sampling of the environment .",
    "once interaction relations have been realized , each node receives a positive recommendation consistent with the standard consensus algorithm from its positive neighbors .",
    "nodes receive negative recommendations from the negative neighbors . following @xcite we consider two models of negative recommendations . in the state - reversion recommendation , each node receives false values from its negative neighbors without necessarily knowing which of its neighbors is positive or negative @xcite . in the relative - state - reversion model ,",
    "nodes receive a repulsive influence from their known negative neighbors . after receiving these recommendations",
    ", each node puts a ( deterministic ) weight to each recommendation , and then encodes these weighted recommendations in its state update through ( stochastic ) attentions defined by two bernoulli random variables .",
    "we establish conditions for the almost sure convergence , divergence , and clustering of the node states for the considered signed random networks .",
    "fundamental similarities and differences are established for the two models of negative recommendations .",
    "we show that strong structural balance  @xcite is crucial for belief clustering in the state - reversion model ( which is consistent with the work of altafini @xcite ) , while weak structural balance is enough in the relative - state - reversion model .",
    "we also show that the deterministic weight and the stochastic attention nodes put on recommendations play a drastically different role for the state convergence and divergence of the network in the two models .",
    "the models share some consistent behaviors : if some arc independence is imposed on the random interactions , two similar no - survivor statements are established , which generalize the results for the gossiping model in @xcite .      in section 2",
    "we propose the network dynamics and the node update rules .",
    "state - reversion and relative - state - reversion models are proposed , respectively , for the negative recommendations of the node updates .",
    "section 3 presents our main results on the state - reversion model as well as the proofs .",
    "then section 4 moves to the relative - state - reversion model and finally some concluding remarks are drawn in section 5 .      a simple directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath0 consists of a finite set @xmath1 of nodes and an arc set @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes an _ arc _ from node @xmath4 to @xmath5 with @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "we call node @xmath8 _ reachable _ from node @xmath9 if there is a directed path from @xmath9 to @xmath8 .",
    "in particular every node is supposed to be reachable from itself .",
    "a node @xmath10 from which every node in @xmath1 is reachable is called a _ center node _ ( root ) .",
    "a digraph @xmath11 is _ strongly connected _ if every two nodes are mutually reachable ; @xmath11 has a spanning tree if it has a center node ; @xmath11 is _ weakly connected _ if a connected undirected graph can be obtained by removing all the directions of the arcs in @xmath12 .",
    "a subgraph @xmath13 of @xmath0 , is a graph on the same node set @xmath14 whose arc set is a subset of @xmath15 .",
    "the induced graph of @xmath16 on @xmath11 , denoted @xmath17 , is the graph @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "a weakly connected component of @xmath13 is a maximal weakly connected induced graph of @xmath13 .",
    "if each arc @xmath20 is associated uniquely with a sign , either @xmath21 or @xmath22 , @xmath23 is called a signed graph and the sign of @xmath24 is denoted as @xmath25 .",
    "the positive and negative subgraphs containing the positive and negative arcs of @xmath11 , are denoted as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",

    "the @xmath29-algebra of a random variable is denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "we use @xmath31 to denote the probability and @xmath32 the expectation of their arguments , respectively .",
    "we consider a dynamic network where each user holds and updates her belief or state when interacting with other users . in this section , we present a general model specifying the network dynamics and the way users interact .",
    "we consider a network with a set @xmath33 of @xmath34 users or nodes , with @xmath35 .",
    "time is slotted , and at each slot @xmath36 , each user can interact with her neighbors in a simple directed graph @xmath37 .",
    "the graph evolves over time in an arbitrary and deterministic manner .",
    "we assume @xmath38 is a signed graph , and we denote by @xmath39 the sign of arc @xmath40 .",
    "the sign of arc @xmath41 indicates whether @xmath9 is a friend ( @xmath42 ) , or an enemy ( @xmath43 ) of node @xmath8 .",
    "the positive and negative subgraphs containing the positive and negative arcs of @xmath44 , are denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we say that the sequence of graphs @xmath47 is _ sign consistent _ if the sign of any arc @xmath41 does not evolve over time , i.e. , if for any @xmath48 , @xmath49 we also define @xmath50 with @xmath51 as the total graph of the network .",
    "if @xmath47 is sign consistent , then the sign of each arc @xmath52 never changes and in that case , @xmath50 is a well - defined signed graph .",
    "next we introduce the notion of positive cluster in a signed directed graph ( digraph ) , which will play an important role in the analysis of the belief dynamics .",
    "let @xmath23 be a signed digraph with positive subgraph @xmath53 .",
    "a subset @xmath54 of the set of nodes @xmath14 is a positive cluster if @xmath54 constitutes a weakly connected component of @xmath55 .",
    "a positive cluster partition of @xmath23 is a partition of @xmath1 into @xmath56 for some @xmath57 , where for all @xmath58 , @xmath59 is a positive cluster .",
    "note that negative arcs may exist between the nodes of a positive cluster .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 admitting a positive - cluster partition is a generalization of the classical definition of weakly structural balance for which negative links are strictly forbidden @xcite . from the above definition ,",
    "it is clear that for any signed graph @xmath23 , there is a unique positive cluster partition @xmath56 of @xmath11 , where @xmath60 is the number of positive clusters covering the entire set @xmath61 of nodes .          at time @xmath62",
    ", node @xmath9 may only interact with her neighboring nodes in @xmath38 .",
    "we present a general model on the random node interactions at a given time @xmath62 .",
    "this model includes the classical erds - rnyi random graph @xcite , gossiping models where a single pair of nodes is chosen at random for interaction @xcite , as well as where all nodes interact with their neighbors at a given time @xcite . at time @xmath62 , some pairs of nodes are randomly selected for interaction .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the random subset of arcs corresponding to interacting node pairs at time @xmath62 . to be precise , @xmath64 is sampled from the distribution @xmath65 defined over the set @xmath66 of all subsets of arcs in @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that @xmath68 form a sequence of independent sets of arcs .",

    "the disjoint sets @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the positive and negative arc set of @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "finally , we split the random set of nodes interacting with node @xmath9 at time @xmath62 depending on the sign of the corresponding arc : for node @xmath9 , the set of positive neighbors is defined as @xmath81 , whereas similarly , the set of negative neighbors is @xmath82 .",
    "next we explain how nodes update their states .",
    "each node @xmath9 holds a state @xmath83 at @xmath84 . to update her state at time @xmath62",
    ", node @xmath9 considers recommendations received from her positive and negative neighbors :    * the positive recommendation node @xmath9 receives at time @xmath62 is @xmath85 . *",
    "the negative recommendations node @xmath9 receives at time @xmath62 are modeled by two different maps : * * the state - reversion recommendation @xmath86 ; * * the relative - state - reversion recommendation @xmath87 .    in the above expressions , we use the convention that summing over empty sets yields a recommendation equal to zero , e.g. , when node @xmath9 has no positive neighbors , then @xmath88 .",
    "the two definitions of negative recommendations have different physical interpretations and make different assumptions on the knowledge that nodes possess about their neighbor relationships .",
    "the state - reversion model can be interpreted as a situation where negative nodes provide false values of their states by flipping the true sign  @xcite .",
    "however , the receiving node does not necessarily know which of its neighbors are positive or negative . in the relative - state - reversion model ,",
    "on the other hand , nodes must know if a specific neighbor is positive or negative to implement the state update that causes the repulsive influence from its negative neighbors @xcite .",
    "now let @xmath89 and @xmath90 be two sequences of independent bernoulli random variables .",
    "we assume that @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 define independent processes . for any @xmath75 , define @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the processes @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent how much attention node @xmath9 pays to the positive and negative recommendations , respectively .",
    "node @xmath9 updates her state as follows : @xmath94 where @xmath95 are two positive constants marking the weight each node put on the positive and negative recommendations , respectively . depending on the definition of @xmath96 , we call the corresponding model the state - reversion model and the relative - state - reversion model , respectively",
    ".    let @xmath97 be the random vector representing the network state at time @xmath62 .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to analyze the behavior of the stochastic process @xmath98 . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath99 the probability measure capturing all random components driving the evolution of @xmath100 .",
    "in this section , we study the system dynamics under the state - reversion model .",
    "we provide conditions for convergence and divergence .",
    "the results are stated in the following subsection , and the remaining of the section is devoted to their proofs .",
    "we begin by stating two natural assumptions on the way nodes are selected for updates , and on the graph dynamics . in the first assumption",
    ", we impose that at time @xmath62 , any arc is selected in @xmath64 with positive probability . the second assumption states that the unions of the graphs @xmath38 over time - windows of fixed duration are strongly connected",

    "the following theorem provides conditions under which the system dynamics converges almost surely .",
    "surprisingly , these conditions are mild : we just require that the sum of the updating parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 is small enough , and that node updates occur with constant probabilities , i.e. , @xmath109 and @xmath110 do not evolve over time .",
    "in particular , the state of each node converges almost surely even if the signs of arcs change over time .",
    "[ thmsr1 ] assume that a1 and a2 hold , and that @xmath95 are such that @xmath111 .",
    "further assume that for any @xmath75 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 for some @xmath114 .",
    "then under the state - reversion model , we have , for all @xmath7 and all initial states @xmath115 , @xmath116    in the above theorem , we say that @xmath117 exists if @xmath118 converges to a finite limit as @xmath62 tends to infinity . characterizing the limiting states",

    "there are however scenarios where this can be done , which require the notion of structural balance  .",
