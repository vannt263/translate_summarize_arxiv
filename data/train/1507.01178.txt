    "in some plasma devices , such as the q - machine or plasma discharge , ions temperature is at least one order of magnitude less than electrons temperature . in such plasma devices , therefore , thermal effects , associated with the ions , are negligible . accordingly , for the study of phenomena involving kinetic effects ( such as electron trapping ) , one deals with solving the vlasov equation for the electrons together with the fluid equations ( the continuity and momentum ) for the ions .",
    "an example of this situation is the generation of ion - acoustic ( ia ) soliton due to the nonlinear decay of a localized perturbation @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the vlasov equation are of fundamental importance for the study of many nonlinear processes in kinetic plasmas .",

    "the vlasov equation is solved for the electrons .",
    "we directly follow the characteristics along which the distribution function of electrons , is constant @xcite .",
    "we choose some representative phase points , in the phase space , that are initialized by an initial distribution function .",
    "the phase points following the characteristics are advanced in time by a predictor - corrector method .",
    "interpolation is performed between the phase points and a fixed grid in the phase space to obtain the distribution function on the grid . from the latter , all the desirable quantities , such as the electron charge density ,",
    "is obtained and used in the poisson equation .",
    "since the ions are assumed to be cold , their dynamics are governed by the fluid equations .",
    "matching of the two different simulation schemes , needs great attention and is the main motivation behind this paper .",
    "first test of the hybrid code is about propagation of a stationary ia soliton .",
    "electron trapping has been considered in the test problem as the result of their nonlinear resonant interaction with the ia soliton . as a non - stationary experiment , soliton generation from an initial gaussian profile",
