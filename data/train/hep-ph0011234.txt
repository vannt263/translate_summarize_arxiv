    "the evidence of the neutrino oscillation was presented by the super - kamiokande collaboration@xcite .",
    "many experiments have been planed and some of them have already been carried out to determine the parameters of the neutrino oscillation@xcite .",
    "recently , the neutrino factory@xcite  a very long ( over 1000 km ) baseline experiment with high energy neutrinos from a muon storage ring has been proposed as the most effective experiment to determine the unknown parameters , @xmath2 , the sign of @xmath3 which is responsible for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the cp violating phase@xcite .    to analyze the oscillation phenomena with such a long baseline",
    ", we have to treat the matter effect@xcite very carefully .",
    "two ways have been adopted to deal with the matter effects : ( i ) to add the averaged matter density @xmath4 as a parameter in addition to the other theoretical parameters like the mixing angles , and estimate it in the same way as the other parameters@xcite .",
    "( ii ) to use the prem  preliminary reference earth model@xcite for the matter density profile , and to assume that we know the ingredients of the earth completely@xcite .",
    "we have , however , questions to these treatments . for the method-(i ) , `` can we describe the matter effect precisely enough by only averaged matter density ? ''",
    "the answer was `` no , we ca nt .",
    "sometimes the deviation from the constant density is important . ''",
    "@xcite . for the method-(ii ) , `` is the prem a trustworthy model for the neutrino oscillation experiments ? ''",
    "the prem is originally based on the study of earthquake waves , hence it predicts the density profile in the depth however , it does nt predict the ingredients of the matter .",
    "therefore , there is an ambiguity in electron number fraction .",
    "then , we should worry whether there are ambiguities in electron number density .",
    "if we estimated the parameters without considering its ambiguity , we would have significant errors in the estimates for the parameters .",
    "therefore , we must introduce the way to take into account the matter profile effect as the parameter determined by the experiments .",
    "we propose the method of the fourier series expansion of the matter profile@xcite .",
    "using the fourier expansion we can parameterize the matter profile .",
    "we can express the matter profile effect with a finite number of the parameters by examining how many terms of the fourier expansion contribute to the oscillation physics within the resolution of the experiments .",
    "we can incorporate the matter profile s ambiguity in the ambiguities of the fourier coefficients .",
    "we will review the method of the fourier series and investigate qualitatively what circumstances make the matter profile effect relevant in section 2 . in section 3 , we will calculate quantitatively the oscillation probabilities and the event rates with various sets of the parameters in baseline lengths .",
    "in this section we introduce the fourier expansion method .",
    "first , we describe its formalism and see its feature .",
    "then , we solve the evolution equation for neutrinos in matter perturbatively , and study the condition where the matter profile effect is significant .",
    "assuming three generations of neutrinos , we parameterize the lepton mixing matrix @xmath5 which relates the flavor eigenstates @xmath6 with the mass eigenstates in vacuum @xmath7 is the part of the majorana phases .",
    "it does nt contribute to the neutrino oscillation phenomena and hence is omitted hereafter .",
    "the evolution in matter of the flavor eigenstates of neutrinos and @xmath8 should be replaced by @xmath9 and @xmath10 . ] with its energy @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13   \\\\ \\begin{array}{lcl } g_f&:&\\text{fermi constant}\\\\   n_{e } ( x)&:&\\text{electron number density }   \\\\",

    "if this expansion can be approximated with a finite number ( @xmath20 ) of terms , @xmath21 then it means that the matter profile effect can be parametrized .",
    "thus , by introducing new parameters @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 , if eq.([an condition ] ) holds ) , we can investigate the oscillation physics without help of earth models .",
    "we solve the evolution equation ( [ schrodinger eq ] ) to see the qualitative feature of the matter profile effect .",
    "first , we divide the hamiltonian @xmath24 into three pieces for the later calculation : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the oscillation phenomena arise from @xmath28 , hence its effect must be fully taken into account . on the other hand @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be treated as the perturbation in almost all cases in neutrino factories , since @xmath31 can be almost always expected .",
    "note that we have to include @xmath32 terms in @xmath33 to deal with the resonance effect .",
    "term in the ( 22 ) element just for convenience .",
    "this inclusion is not essential . ]",
    "next , we rewrite @xmath28 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mixing matrix and mass square eigenvalues in matter up to the zeroth order of the `` perturbation ' 's @xmath29 and @xmath30 and defined by @xmath37    then we solve the evolution equation ( [ schrodinger eq ] ) perturbatively as @xmath38_{\\beta \\alpha }       | \\nu_{\\alpha } ( 0 ) \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\",
