    "type ia supernovae ( sne ) are the end - products of white dwarfs with a mass approaching the chandrasekhar limit , which results in a thermonuclear explosion of the star .",
    "in addition to their use as cosmological distance indicators ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , type ia sne ( henceforth sne ia ) are a major contributor to the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is therefore unfortunate that we do not yet know what makes a sn ia .",
    "this lack of knowledge makes it difficult to gain a physical understanding of the explosions , so that we can model possible evolution , which compromises their use as distance indicators .",
    "it also means we do not fully understand the timescale over which sne ia turn on , adding a large uncertainty to our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "unveiling the progenitor scenario for sne ia is difficult because white dwarfs ( wds ) can , theoretically , reach their fatal chandrasekhar mass in many ways , and disentangling which is the correct one ( if there is just one ) , is challenging from an observational point of view . nonetheless , there are two basic families of models leading to a sn ia , the single - degenerate model ( sd ) and the double - degenerate model ( dd ) . in the sd scenario , a wd accretes mass from a hydrogen - rich companion star before reaching a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass and going off as supernova . in the dd scenario ,",
    "two wds merge , with the more - massive wd being thought to tidally disrupt and accrete the lower - mass wd ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "observations can potentially discriminate between the progenitor models of sne ia .",
    "for example , in all scenarios with mass transfer from a companion , a significant amount of circumstellar gas is expected ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore a shock is bound to form when the supernova ejecta are expelled",
    ". the situation would then be very similar to circumstellar interaction in core - collapse sne , where the interaction of the blast wave from the supernova with its circumstellar medium results in strong radio and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the dd scenario will not give rise to any circumstellar medium close to the progenitor system , and hence essentially no radio emission is expected .",
    "radio and x - ray observations of sn  2011fe have provided the most sensitive constraints on possible circumstellar material @xcite around a normal sn  ia .",

    "the non - detections of radio and x - ray emission from sne  ia have added to a growing consensus that a large fraction of sne  ia may not be the result of sd scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the non - detection of radio and x - ray emission , there is evidence of possible circumstellar material in the form of time - varying absorption features in the optical na  i  d line for a few sne  ia @xcite , supposed to arise in circumstellar shells .",
    "the exact location of the absorbing gas is still debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the limit on @xmath162 we find for  is @xmath174 times lower than for sn  2011fe , and is therefore clearly the lowest limit on density for the constant density case in any sn  ia .    as for the @xmath39 case ,",
    "ssa is unimportant for the @xmath40 case . to be efficient enough to mute the radio emission to be consistent with the observed upper limit",
    ", @xmath162 would have to be @xmath175 ( for @xmath176 ) , which is fully ruled out from x - ray limits , as well the normal optical behaviour of the supernova .",
    "while usually not acknowledged in the sn ia literature , the obtained radio and x - ray upper limits on the circumstellar density are model dependent . in particular , equations [ eq : lum1 ] through [ eq : lum4 ] show how most parameters influence the results .",
    "we already mentioned the uncertainty in @xmath57 and , especially , @xmath58 , whereas @xmath70 is observationally constrained by other similar radio sources .",
    "the thickness of the radio - emitting region is yet another source of uncertainty , but probably small in comparison to other uncertainties .",
    "there is also an uncertainty in the upper limit on @xmath147 due to values chosen for @xmath96 and @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcurves_params ] shows two models , both with @xmath121 and @xmath60 , but where we have also assumed @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( solid lines ) , and @xmath115 and @xmath179 ( dashed lines ) . in both models we have used the earliest @xmath180 jvla point for  to constrain @xmath147 . for the @xmath177 model , @xmath181 , i.e. , a factor @xmath182 lower than the @xmath115 model in figure  [ fig : lcurves ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath115 therefore gives a conservative limit on @xmath147 , unless @xmath183 .",
    "judging from type ib / ic sne , the expected deviation from @xmath115 is not large @xcite , so we do not consider the uncertainty in @xmath65 being a major source of uncertainty for @xmath147 .    for the @xmath179 model , @xmath184 , i.e. , a factor @xmath185",
    "higher than the @xmath178 model in figure  [ fig : lcurves ] . the choice of @xmath178 may give too low a limit on @xmath147 , unless a shallower density profile than @xmath178 is expected .",
    "indeed , @xcite argue that an exponential density profile of the outer ejecta fits early explosion models better than a power law , and could indicate steeper profiles than at least @xmath186 for the outermost ejecta",
    ". we have also run models for @xmath186 , but the value for @xmath147 then becomes so low ( @xmath187 ) that the model breaks down , producing shock velocities in excess of @xmath188 .",
    "for such low wind densities , a relativistic treatment of the shock interaction is needed , similar to for gamma - ray bursts . from the models of @xcite",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that @xmath189 for the outermost ejecta , which in our model would imply an upper limit of @xmath190 .",
    "the span in upper limit on @xmath147 by a factor of @xmath191 between @xmath192 shows that the unknown density profile for the outermost ejecta is an important source of uncertainty , and that accurate models for the outermost ejecta are needed .",
    "this is even more evident for the constant density case @xmath40 , for which we find that our limit on @xmath162 ranges from @xmath193 for @xmath194 to @xmath195 for @xmath179 , assuming @xmath121 , @xmath60 and @xmath115 .",
    "the solution for @xmath194 is , however , unphysical due to too large velocities for the shock during the first @xmath196 days , calling for a relativistic treatment of the dynamics .",
    "the sd progenitor systems involve only one wd and include , in decreasing order of mass - loss rate from the supernova progenitor , symbiotic systems , wds with steady nuclear burning , and recurrent novae .    in a symbiotic system ,",

    "the wd loses this accreted matter at rates of @xmath197and @xmath198 .",

    "thus , our radio non - detection rules out a symbiotic system as the progenitor of sn  2014j ( red region in figure [ fig : mdot - vwind ] ) .",
    "another possible sd scenario is one where a main sequence , subgiant , helium , or giant star undergoes roche lobe overflow onto the wd at rates of @xmath199 @xcite . at those accretion rates , the wd experiences steady nuclear burning @xcite . for an assumed fraction @xmath200 of the transferred mass to be lost from the system",
    ", the mass - loss rate is constrained to @xmath201 and typical speeds of 100 @xmath202 3000 , where the low speeds apply for steady nuclear burning , while the high speeds apply to the systems with the highest accretion rates . at the lower end of @xmath203 , the mass loss through the outer lagrangian points of the system",

    "the winds become optically thick , limiting the accretion rate to @xmath205 and wind speeds of a few @xmath206 1000  @xcite .",
    "our data essentially rule out completely the high - accretion rate scenario of a wd with steady nuclear burning ( cyan region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot - vwind ] ) .    finally , another possible sd channel is that of recurrent novae , which lie at the lowest accretion rate regime among popular sd scenarios . here , a wd accreting at a rate @xmath207 , ejects shells of material at speeds of a few @xmath208 , with typical recurrence times of a few years .",
    "the radio observations in table [ tab : radiolog ] probe a radius of @xmath209  cm ( for @xmath39 and @xmath210 ) , which constrains the presence of shells with recurrence times of @xmath211  yr . models of recurrent novae seem to indicate that as much as @xmath1015% of the accreted material over the recurrence time is ejected @xcite . for the typical accretion rates above",
    ", this implies an ejected shell mass of @xmath212 , which should have been detected by our sensitive observations ( see gold region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot - vwind ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the short duration of the nova radio burst , a few days at most , may have prevented its detection , so we can not rule out completely the possibility of a nova shell ejection . during the quiescent phase between nova shell ejections , the wd accretes at a rate of @xmath213 , so that the mass - loss wind parameter is @xmath214 . if @xmath121 , our observations rule out almost completely the scenario with wd accretion during the quiescent phase of the star , whereas the case with @xmath122 can not be excluded completely ( green region in fig . [",
    "fig : mdot - vwind ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "our observations exclude completely symbiotic systems and the majority of the parameter space associated with stable nuclear burning wds , as viable progenitor systems for sn  2014j .",
    "recurrent novae with main sequence or subgiant donors can not be ruled out completely , yet most of their parameter space is also excluded by our observations .",
    "the alternative to a sd scenario is the dd channel , which involves two wds in a binary system . in this case",
    ", the progenitor star is expected to have exploded in a constant ambient density medium .",
    "we can estimate the density in the region surrounding sn  2014j from the column density of neutral hydrogen toward the supernova position , @xmath215 @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "assuming a path length , @xmath217 100 pc , and solar abundance ( @xmath218 ) , the particle number density at the supernova location is @xmath219 0.9 @xmath220 .",
    "our stacked eevn limits imply @xmath221 @xmath220 for @xmath222 ( 0.01 ) , and are thus consistent with the sn directly expanding into the interstellar medium",
    ". therefore , our radio non - detections are consistent with the dd channel for sne  ia .",
    "we note that the limit imposed on @xmath162 by the microphysical parameter @xmath121 is formally similar to the likely value of @xmath162 at the sn location . yet , the uncertainties involved in this estimate are such that both values are in agreement . at any rate ,",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath58 on @xmath162 demonstrates the usefulness of late - time radio observations to constrain this relevant microphysical parameter in sne  ia .",
    "for example , a non - detection of  one year after explosion with the same observational limit as from our stacked 1.66 ghz observations would , according to our model , constrain @xmath162 to @xmath223 , assuming @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath178 , @xmath115 and @xmath226 .",
    "the supernova shock wave will at this point be located at @xmath227 cm",
    ". a non - detection at such late epochs and such low flux levels , will certainly be very useful in constraining @xmath58 .",
    "the recent and nearby sne 2011fe and 2014j have offered a remarkable possibility to learn about the origin of sne ia .",
    "we have shown here that deep radio observations can be used to rule out several progenitor models for and a similar discussion was made for sn  2011fe by @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , @xcite provided deep limits for sn  2011fe from x - rays ( cf .",
    " [ sec : intro ] ) , which do not depend on @xmath58 , but where the limit on circumstellar density has a stronger dependence on @xmath57 and @xmath64 than for radio emission . while @xmath228 has been used by us and others ,",
    "it must be cautioned that , e.g. , sn  1993j had a much lower value @xcite , although it is clear that this supernova bears little resemblance with type ib / ic sne , which have been used as templates to model sne ia .    for sn  2011fe , the non - detections in radio and x - rays were accompanied with no circumstellar line absorption @xcite and a non - detection of late nebular emission from gas ablated off an sd companion @xcite .",
    "this , together with other evidence for sn  2011fe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has been used to argue for an increased likelihood of sne ia being the endpoint of a dd scenario rather than sd scenarios .",
    "our non - detections of radio emission from  in principle add to this evidence .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that a sd scenario , with a spun - up / spun - down super - chandrasekhar wd ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can still be possible if the donor star shrinks far inside its roche lobe prior to the explosion .",
    "this would make the sd companion smaller and more tightly bound , and only very dilute circumstellar gas would be expected in the immediate vicinity of the wd .",
    "@xcite argue that density could be of the same order as typical interstellar densities .",
    "continued radio observations of both sne  2011fe and 2014j could be useful to test the presence of such low - density gas ( cf .",
    " [ sec : dd ] ) .    for a typical time - scale of @xmath229 years between last roche - lobe overflow and explosion @xcite , and a wind speed of @xmath1 , the last traces of substantial circumstellar gas could in this scenario",
    "be at a distance of @xmath230 cm , and could explain the presumed shell around , e.g. , sn  2006x @xcite . if the supernova ejecta would start to interact with such a shell , radio emission would increase .",
    "radio observations of sn  2006x @xcite two years after explosion , however , failed to detect any emission . @xcite",
    "estimated a shell radius of @xmath231  cm , which according to the estimate in ",
    "[ sec : sd ] , was most likely overtaken by the supernova ejecta by @xmath232 years .",
    "continued monitoring of  would be useful to trace these putative shells .",
    "we emphasize that shells around supernovae do not have to lie along the line of sight to be detected in radio , as opposed to the narrow absorption line features .",
    "this should increase the possibility to detect such shells in the radio , especially if shells are as common as suggested ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "interaction with shells are also better observed in the radio than in x - rays , as no inverse compton scattering is expected at late times when the supernova has faded and the distance from the line emitting sn ejecta and the shell is large .",
    "@xcite caution that the lack of signatures from an sd companion could be a problem for the model of @xcite , as only @xmath233 of ablated mass from the companion can be accommodated by the observations of @xcite , in combination with an extrapolation of the models presented in @xcite and @xcite , before giving rise to detectable h@xmath15 emission in the nebular phase ; all models calculated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite predict more than @xmath234 of ablated mass . a way to avoid h@xmath15",
    "emission is , of course , if the donor is he - rich .",
    "the models of @xcite show that of order @xmath235 of he - rich gas would then reside in the centre of the supernova in the nebular phase .",
    "however , even if the donor is h - rich , the caution by @xcite should not be over interpreted .",
    "the opacity in the nebular emission models of @xcite and @xcite does not contain as many spectral lines as more recent models by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "scattering in the spectral region around h@xmath15 could be more severe than previously anticipated , and the constraint from lack of nebular h@xmath15 less important .",
    "nebular lines further out in the red should suffer from less scattering , and the models discussed in @xcite show that narrow ( @xmath236 ) [ ca  ii ] lines are present in the red , and could thus be more constraining than h@xmath15 .",
    "traces of these lines could be useful to test scenarios with both h- and he - rich donors .",
    "further detailed modeling of the nebular phase is indeed needed , as well as modeling of supernova ejecta colliding with compact companions such as those in the models of @xcite .",
    "deep nebular spectra of sn  2014j are warranted to test those impact models , due to the sn proximity .",
    "a potential problem is , however , the extinction toward sn  2014j and the complicated interstellar imprint on the supernova spectrum @xcite .",
    "the latter may , in particular , make the search for narrow - line variations more cumbersome than for , e.g. , sn 2006x .      at the moment ,",
    "our deepest radio limits on circumstellar gas are for sne  2011fe and 2014j . with the advent of the square kilometre array ( ska )",
    ", we will be able to obtain significantly deeper radio limits ( or , potentially , a detection ) for sne ia exploding at the distance of m  82 . for more distant supernovae",
    ", we will obtain similar limits to those obtained for sne  2011fe and 2014j , which will allow us to build a picture from a larger statistical sample .",
    "the first phase of ska considers three different components .",
    "one of them , ska1-mid , promises to yield 1@xmath123 sensitivities of @xmath237jy / b in one hour at a fiducial frequency of 1.7 ghz .",
    "this figure is five times better than currently provided by the most sensitive array , the jvla .",
    "therefore , ska1-mid should be able to either detect the putative radio emission of sn  2014j - like objects up to distances @xmath238 mpc in less than one hour , or put significantly better constraints on some of the parameter space of sd scenarios for the next sn ia that explodes in m  82 , some of which could not be completely ruled out even by our very deep radio observations .",
    "however , the expected number of sn  ia per year in such a volume of the local universe is small . indeed",
    ", since the volumetric sn ia rate is @xmath239 sn / yr / mpc@xmath240 @xcite , we should expect on average one sn ia every @xmath1015 yr within a distance of @xmath2418 mpc , which is a small value . to obtain a statistically significant sample of sne  ia observed in radio , with similar upper limits to those obtained by us for sn  2014j",
    ", we need to sample significantly larger volumes and need much more sensitive radio observations .",
    "for example , by sampling out to a distance of 25 mpc , we can expect @xmath102 sne  ia per year within the sampled volume , which in 10 years would result in a total of @xmath1020 sne  ia , enough to extract statistical results . at this maximum distance",
    ", we need a sensitivity of @xmath1050 times better than obtained by the observations discussed here , to be as constraining , or @xmath242 njy / b .",
    "when ska is completed , the fiducial 1@xmath123 sensitivity should be 10 times better than for ska1-mid , or about @xmath243  njy / b in one hour , and such statistical studies will be perfectly possible in short amounts of time . at this level of sensitivity , a non - detection would be essentially as meaningful as a direct detection , since the former would imply that only the dd scenario is viable , while the latter would tell us which of the sd channels result in sne ia .",
    "we report deep eevn and emerlin radio observations of the type ia sn  2014j in the nearby galaxy m  82 , along with a detailed modeling of its radio emission .",
    "our observations result in non - detections of the radio emission from sn  2014j . yet , radio data and modeling allow us to place a tight constraint on the mass loss rate from the progenitor system of sn  2014j .",
    "namely , if the exploding wd was surrounded by a wind with a density profile @xmath4 , as expected for a sd scenario , then our upper limit to the mass - loss rate is @xmath244 , for a wind speed of @xmath1 .",
    "if , on the contrary , the circumstellar gas has a constant density , as expected to be the case for the dd scenario ( but also in a small region of the parameter space of sd scenarios ) , then our modeling yields an upper limit on the gas density , such that @xmath2 .    our stringent upper limits to the circumstellar density around sn  2014j",
    "allow us to exclude completely symbiotic systems and the majority of the parameter space associated with stable nuclear burning wds , as viable progenitor systems for sn  2014j .",
    "for the case of recurrent novae with main sequence or subgiant donors , we can not rule out them completely , yet most of their parameter space is also excluded by our observations for the standard assumption of @xmath121 , where @xmath58 is the ratio of magnetic energy density to post - shock thermal energy density .",
    "we have also reassessed the radio limits on wind density for sn  2011fe , and for @xmath121 we obtain @xmath245 ( for a wind speed of @xmath1 ) and @xmath246 .",
    "these limits are close to those calculated by @xcite .",
    "our limit on @xmath247 for  is thus similar to that for sn  2011fe , whereas for the constant density case we obtain a much lower limit than for sn  2011fe , and hence the lowest limit for a constant density ambient around a sn  ia .",
    "the combined radio limits on circumstellar gas around sne  2011fe and 2014j add to evidence from mainly non - detections of x - rays from sn  2011fe and 2014j@xcite and no detection of h@xmath15 in the nebular phase of sn  2011fe @xcite , that sne  ia are very likely to stem from the dd scenario , rather than sd scenarios .    finally , we highlight future observations with the square kilometre array ( ska ) . when fully completed , the ska is likely to yield limits on circumstellar gas for future sne  ia similar to the limits reported here for the nearby sne  2011fe and 2014j , but for distances well beyond the virgo cluster . for nearby sne",

    "<S> we report deep evn and emerlin observations of the type ia sn  2014j in the nearby galaxy m  82 . </S>",
    "<S> our observations represent , together with jvla observations of sne  2011fe and 2014j , the most sensitive radio studies of type ia sne ever . by combining data and a proper modeling of the radio emission , we constrain the mass - loss rate from the progenitor system of sn  2014j to @xmath0 ( for a wind speed of @xmath1 ) . if the medium around the supernova is uniform , then @xmath2 , which is the most stringent limit for the ( uniform ) density around a type ia sn . </S>",
    "<S> our deep upper limits favor a double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario  involving two wd stars  for the progenitor system of sn  2014j , as such systems have less circumstellar gas than our upper limits . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , most single - degenerate ( sd ) scenarios , i.e. , the wide family of progenitor systems where a red giant , main - sequence , or sub - giant star donates mass to a exploding wd , are ruled out by our observations  ( for a wind speed of @xmath1 ) and @xmath3 , for the @xmath4 wind and constant density cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as these limits are less constraining than ours , the findings by @xcite do not alter our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray results are , however , important to rule out free - free and synchrotron self - absorption as a reason for the radio non - detections . ] . </S>",
    "<S> our estimates on the limits to the gas density surrounding sn2011fe , using the flux density limits from @xcite , agree well with their results . </S>",
    "<S> although we discuss possibilities for a sd scenario to pass observational tests , as well as uncertainties in the modeling of the radio emission , the evidence from sne  2011fe and 2014j points in the direction of a dd scenario for both . </S>"
