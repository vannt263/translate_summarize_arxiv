    "ion - mobility spectrometry ( ims ) is a well established analytical technique used to separate and identify ionized molecules in the gas phase of a volatile compound .",
    "this technique is based on the molecules mobility in a carrier buffer gas .",
    "the ions acquire a drift velocity through their mobility due to interactions with an electric field of magnitude @xmath0 . to the lowest order ,",
    "drift velocity is @xmath1 with @xmath2 the ion mobility , which allows us to identify the compound .",
    "a dependence of @xmath2 with thermal fluctuation , electrical charge , gas density and collision cross - section , can be obtained from the balance between mobility and diffusion forces during an elastic collision of the ionized molecule against a neutral molecule@xcite    traditional devices for time - of - flight ims@xcite come in a wide range of sizes ( often tailored for a specific application ) and are capable of operating under a broad range of conditions@xcite above the millimeters scale@xcite .",
    "these devices use a ion impulse field that is parallel to the flow of the carrier gas@xcite .",
    "in contrast , aspiration condenser ims also known as cross - flow methods  @xcite use an impulse field that is transverse to the flow of the carrier gas .",
    "a transverse impulse field allows splitting of a stream of ions within the flow of the carrier buffer gas , according to the respective mobility of ions@xcite .",
    "two main movement vectors are obtained : one in the flow s direction and the other perpendicular to it .",
    "devices that apply this method are remarkably compact and relatively easy to manufacture using micro - system technology .",
    "there are many methods of cross flow combined with pattern recognition and also mass - spectrometry for ion identification@xcite .",
    "one problem with these method is the low resolving - power due to overlapping of ions on detectors caused by diffusion and space charge effects .",
    "such effects can be reduced by increasing the flow rate as long as laminar flow conditions remain the same .",
    "a swept - field aspiration condenser ims uses a variable electric drift field to move all ion species across a single detector electrode@xcite .",
    "a variable deflection voltage applied to a single detector electrode can replace a detector made by an array of electrodes .",
    "an ion mobility distribution is obtained by applying the discrete inverse tammet transformation to @xmath3 data . however , reconstruction of the ion mobility distribution is difficult when the signal to measure is comparable to the noise and , therefore , identification possibilities of the actual signal are reduced .",
    "a radioactive ionization source is commonly used to produce ions . however , in this way , ions completely cover the entrance to the detection zone difficulting their identification . to increase identification capabilities , some ion - focusing methods proposed@xcite the use of funnels to guide ions before the splitting caused by the transverse impulse field .",
    "basically , ion focusing creates a concentrated starting point for ions to start to travel forming a well - defined trajectory for each compound and allowing to improve ion identification .",
    "ions with different mobility will have different trajectories@xcite .",
    "it has been utterly expensive and complex to apply this kind of solution so far , because of the inconveniences existing at the sub - millimeter scale . in",
    "the ion - focusing aspiration condenser ims , funnels or intricate channels are implemented to narrow down the flow inside the system@xcite , thus generating potential turbulences which do not allow the ions to continue their travel .",
    "this results in a loss of identification efficiency@xcite when both high flow rates and a laminar condition are necessary .    here , we present novel concepts for a different approach to produce ion focusing without any physical object acting as a funnel",
    ".     drifts ions to produce the stream reaching the detectors .",
    "ions with larger mobility @xmath4 reach the detectors closer to the entrance , between positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 whereas ions with smaller mobility @xmath7 reaches the detectors at farther positions , between @xmath8 and @xmath9.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as illustrated in fig.[fig : separa ] , ions with mobility @xmath4 and @xmath7 , where @xmath10 starting at the same initial location near to generated lobes of ions and defined by a stream of ions with lower position @xmath11 and higher position @xmath12 travel towards the detection area forming two stream . one stream reaches the detection area that starts in @xmath6 with length @xmath13 for ions with @xmath4 mobility . the other stream reaches and area that starts in @xmath9 with length @xmath14 for ions with @xmath7 mobility .",
    "none of the ion streams will overlap on detectors , and the required separability will be verified as long as the trajectory of ions with larger mobility ( and moving on the lowest side of the ion stream ) and the trajectory of ions with smaller mobility ( moving on the higher side of the ion stream ) will meet at a point @xmath15 with @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the channel height .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",

    "section [ sec : results ] presents analysis of the experimental prototype setup to generate localized ions or lobes of ions .",
    "this section also presents a numerical simulation about the resolving power and resolution to show the advantages of our proposed device .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] includes our main conclusions .",
    "the hypothesis based on a localized ion generation and laminar flow means that the access of generated ion to the detection zone is very small , with height @xmath18 . for a constant carrier flow in the detection zone ,",
    "two orthogonal components exist in ion movements : the constant flow velocity @xmath19 and the drift velocity @xmath20 eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , considering that an ion from @xmath21 uses the same time to arrive to the detector in @xmath22 for each direction of movements , we obtain : @xmath23 where the drift field can be estimated by @xmath24 , assuming border effects are negligible and electric voltage @xmath25 , applied on the detectors , generates a uniform field in the detection zone .",

    "eq.([ec : foco2 ] ) provides an upper bound for the scaling of this focalization with the detection size of the device allowing identification of the species .",
    "this requirement to scale the system prompted us to use micro - system technology .",
    "the originality of the present research lays in the solution reached .",
    "the device was designed considering both the position and direction of mobility vectors of ions , from the generation and transportation of ion up to their detection .",
    "this design was possible by arranging the respective directions of electric discharges , fluid transportation , and the electric fields used for detection , orthogonally to each other . in this way , we minimized influences among the ion movements in these directions . by employing a virtual model of the micro - device using the coventorware software @xcite we constructed the design shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maqueta ] .",
    "this software allows us to simulate the construction of the model ; from the optic layers to the manufacturing process@xcite . with lift off ,",
    "the design proceeds ; a positive photo - resin is deposited on a glass substrate and protected with a plastic cover , containing the image of the target structure .",
    "the resin is modified by uv light in unprotected places , and unmodified part of the resin can be removed with the cover as well .",
    "the remaining construct is completely covered with a layer of copper using an anionic deposition process @xcite . finally , the resin layer is removed with acetone , leaving the geometry of the copper layer on the substrate . this manufacturing process has been used because of its flexibility and sturdiness .",
    "also , one goal of this work is obtaining a minimum size compact ion - generation / ion - detector , with low cost and simple manufacture .",
    "the proposed micro - device has two main zones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : maqueta ] ) ; the ionization and the detection zone . in the ionization zone ,",
    "lobes of ions are generated by employing an electric discharge of corona type ( see section  [ sec : generaion ] for details ) .",
    "charged particles of the sample are transported via a carrier gas to the detection zone . when entering the first zone , both the carrier gas and the sample move along the two guide through the device towards the ionization zone .",

    "each source has seven pairs of flat , metallic electrodes , the two electrodes ; placed in front of each other at 40@xmath31 m .",
    "the anode has six triangular tips , at a distance of 300@xmath31 m from one another , and one flat cathode .",
    "the distance between two sources is 1500@xmath31 m and the last source is 540@xmath31 m away from the detection zone .",
    "these can be individually connected across the connection electrodes , fig .",
    "[ fig : maqueta ] ( 2 ) and ( 8) .    in the detection zone , the detectors are immersed in an electrostatic field that deflects and separates ions according to their mobility .",
    "this zone has a flat electrode with a single connection mounted on the inferior substrate . individually connected and flat sectioned electrodes are mounted on the superior substrate .",
    "each electrode is 900@xmath31 m long and at a distance separated 100@xmath31 m from the next electrode , as shown by ( 6 ) and ( 3 ) respectively in fig.[fig : maqueta ] .",

    "we estimate a flow in laminar regime due to @xmath371000 .",
    "the ion generation problem is solved using a localized production of a self - limited discharge .",
    "electric discharges due to dielectric rupture can be produced via enough energy accumulation between two electrodes on which an electrostatic difference voltage is applied  @xcite . for our propose , the state before the beginning of luminescence ,",

    "we found that it is possible to approximately establish a same average distance @xmath48 from the origin of the curvature radius to the surface defining a volume where @xmath553 v/@xmath31 m .",
    "as peek s law is verified at the micrometer scale@xcite , this same average distance @xmath48 should be approximately equal to an effective radius @xmath56 , measuring the curvature radius in micrometers .",
    "this prediction becomes true with a 10% sampling error in every case .",
    "the proposed alternative solutions for ion focusing using a corona discharge ion micro - generation are described in sections  [ sec : teoria ] , [ sec : dispositivo ] , and  [ sec : generaion ] .",
    "considering that eq.([eq1 ] ) and cross - flow design concepts can only be applied in a non - turbulent regime , we analyzed how the fluid should travel along the channel .",
    "we propose a channel with a rectangular section that remains constant along both zones of the device , which means that there are no detours , expansions , or contractions along the entire flow . considering this ,",
    "first we verify the laminar flow condition by using the reynold number that we estimate for non - circular sections as @xmath57 in terms of the cinematic viscosity @xmath58 and the hydraulic radius @xmath59 corresponding to the ratio between the fluid normal section area and its perimeter , and @xmath60 as the channel width .",
    "the flow rate @xmath61 is implicit in the above equation , because it is estimated as the average velocity of flow @xmath19 multiplied by the section of the channel : @xmath62 .",
    "for the objective of our proposed design , we made a significant size reduction for @xmath17 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we need @xmath61 to be low enough so @xmath63 that ensure laminar condition of the fluid regime",
    ". however , @xmath61 can not be too low , because the number of ions would be too small to be analyzed .",
    "also , longitudinal dimensions of the channel have to be small enough so that the lifespan of generated ions is longer than time they take to arrive to the detection zone .",

    "when increasing the flow rate to 5@xmath88 , the charge diminishes to more than half of the previous charge . note that also the difference of @xmath90 with higher signal for @xmath79 is consistent with our theoretical model , since concentrating detection towards half of the length of the detection zone increases the probability to detect ions . in the context of an optimal design that considers the lifespan of ions ,",
    "a better signal is obtained using @xmath79 rather than @xmath89 because ions at @xmath79 are detected in half of the time than ions at @xmath89 . with flow rates of 5@xmath88 and 10@xmath88",

    "this means that by increasing the applied voltage two- , three- , and five - fold ( from 9v to 18 , @xmath9128 , and @xmath9146v , respectively ) the highest signal is measured by the detector positioned at half , one third , and one fifth of the total distance , respectively , as predicted by simulations .",

    ", we could state that the performed experiments involving four voltages and one compound could ideally be translated into an experiment involving one voltage and four compounds .",
    "this is possible because channel height is constant , and @xmath0 is approximated to @xmath24 in eq.([eq1 ] ) , which means that drift velocity depends only on the product of mobilities and the applied electric voltages .",

    "in this work we address the problem to identify ion species at the sub - millimeter scale based on their mobility and a standard cross - flow method . to solve this problem",
    ", we propose a novel manufacturing method using micro - system technology .",
    "we analyze the corona discharge and verify peek s law in the micro - scale . with this , we dimensioned the geometry for the proposed ion generator allowing it to localize the ion generation and , therefore , implicitly focus ions to the entrance of the detection zone , in a smaller size than the drift height . at the same time",
    ", we analyzed the flow of the system to design transportation of ions from their generation point to their detection point . by introducing orthogonal movements we made numerical simulations to analyze viscosity effects and state experimental configuration to guarantee the laminar flow condition .",
    "we found a simplified design for the construction of the micro - system , which avoids expansions or contractions . in this way , turbulence and",
    "stopped - flow zones are minimized in an adequate flow range , allowing us to optimize the functioning of the device .",
    "we performed experiments on a prototype of the proposed design to verify our hypothesis on localized ion generation as a solution for ion species identification at sub - millimeter scale .",
    "variation of the average trajectory of the ion stream with the variation of drift velocity can be analyzed with a parabolic velocity profile .",
    "we showed that for a case in which variations of drift velocity are 25@xmath92 the charge signals displayed a negligible overlapping of 1 mm on the detection zone . for smaller differences in other volatile compounds",
    "we would need to adjust the parameters used here ( as these depend on the application of the device ) , but not the architecture of the design .",
    "we have proposed an upper bound for the size of the ion lobes in terms of the total drift height and the ratio of ion mobilities to effectively separate ion specie .",
    "finally , we highlight how our design is elegantly simplified compared to more complex solutions in other methods  @xcite .",
    "we obtained a compact micro - model that has two advantages : it does not use radioactive sources to generate ions , but an electrical source not exceeding 1kv , and it would reach a higher resolving power than currently available methods .",
