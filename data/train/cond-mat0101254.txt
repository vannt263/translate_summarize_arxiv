    "when we regard a multiparticle system such as helium4 , we can choose between two possible points of view .",
    "we can zoom in on the details of the interactions , focusing on only a few particles , and in a first approach we might choose to study how the interactions of just two particles can be described .",
    "this is typically investigated by scattering experiments , and a quite precise picture of the two  particle interaction for helium4 exists.@xcite on the other hand , we can also take a broader view and turn to the thermodynamic properties of many particles where properties such as pressure , temperature , and superfluidity arise.@xcite    these two pictures are , of course , connected to each other as the thermodynamic properties are large scale effects of the ( local ) microscopic interactions . yet for helium4 in the interesting region around the superfluid phase transition ,",
    "a complete mathematical description , which makes this connection explicit , is still lacking , to our best knowledge .",
    "a general problem in the calculation of thermodynamic properties is the occurrance of infrared divergences . here",

    "group equation.@xcite    the goal of this work is threefold .",
    "first of all , we demonstrate how nonuniversal properties of thermodynamic systems can be calculated by means of an exact renormalization  group equation .",
    "second , we present first results for the critical chemical potential and the equation of state for helium4 obtained merely from the microscopic interactions .",
    "and third , we show the necessity of a shift of the chemical potential in the action , which arises from the mathematical manipulations of the functional integral and becomes important in the calculation of the phonon spectrum and the critical chemical potential .",
    "we have reported on the appearance of this shift earlier @xcite and now show its effect in application .",
    "the renormalization group is well suited for the treatment of the superfluid phase transition .",
    "while a perturbative approach is plagued by infrared divergences , the renormalization group naturally circumvents these difficulties .",
    "it also presents an intuitive connection between the microscopic and the macroscopic pictures .",
    "it starts with just the microscopic interactions . after integrating out the single  particle degrees of freedom consecutively from the effective ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff at large momentum down to zero momentum",
    ", a complete thermodynamic description of the system is obtained .",
    "this basic idea@xcite is implemented in our approach by a functional differential equation that represents the lowering of an infrared cutoff .",
    "there is , in principle , no restriction on the relative interaction strength or the density of the system as in most perturbative approaches .",
    "details of the method can be found elsewhere.@xcite    a similar approach to the calculation of nonuniversal properties for bose condensates by renormalization  group methods was taken by bijlsma and stoof , restricted to low density gases.@xcite another recent application of renormalization group methods to superfluid helium combined with the exploitation of the underlying symmetry and related ward identity has successfully treated the infrared divergences that occur in the computation of low  lying excitations.@xcite",

    "we thus resort to normalizing the pressure at the critical temperature , where @xmath3 is given by the fixed  point condition , and only calculate the @xmath54 dependence of @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pressure ] shows the dependence of the pressure on the temperature for three different values of the chemical potential . since we need to specify the chemical potential in our formalism when we want to calculate the order parameter and the density at vapor pressure , we determine @xmath158 from this result and use the experimentally known vapor  pressure curve for @xmath159 .",
    "* order parameter .",
    "* while the critical exponent @xmath144 describes the growing of the order parameter in the @xmath146 universality class , we can also calculate the order parameter for the helium system explicitly .",
    "it is given by the expectation value of the field @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , @xmath160 gives the magnitude squared of the expectation value of the field . in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter ] , we show the results for the temperature dependence of @xmath161 .",
    "the superfluid density is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "the proportionality constant , however , depends on the wave  function renormalization , which is not accurately determined so far . * density . * finally , we compute the particle density as @xmath162 the inverse full propagator is block diagonal in @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath163}{\\delta\\varphi^{*}_{n , q } \\delta\\varphi_{n , q } } & \\frac{\\delta^{2}\\gamma_k[\\varphi,\\varphi^{*}]}{\\delta\\varphi_{-n ,- q } \\delta\\varphi_{n , q } } \\\\ & \\\\ \\frac{\\delta^{2}\\gamma_k[\\varphi,\\varphi^{*}]}{\\delta\\varphi^{*}_{n , q } \\delta\\varphi^{*}_{-n ,- q } } & \\frac{\\delta^{2}\\gamma_k[\\varphi,\\varphi^{*}]}{\\delta\\varphi_{-n ,- q } \\delta\\varphi^{*}_{-n ,- q } } \\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] and contains for @xmath91 the information about the phonon energy spectrum for given @xmath3 and @xmath54 and arbitrary strength of the interaction . the trace in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rawdensity ] ) includes a summation over momenta and matsubara frequencies .",
    "we calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath164 from the truncation ( [ eq : truncation ] ) and explicitly sum over the matsubara frequencies .",
    "this yields ( in the rescaled field variable ) @xmath165 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 again denote the inverse propagators of the goldstone and the radial mode as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : props ] ) , but with @xmath166 .",
    "the masses @xmath167 and @xmath168 are taken at @xmath88 , so that in the spontaneously broken phase we have @xmath169 and in the symmetric phase @xmath94 and @xmath170 .",
    "as in the calculation of the pressure , the calculations of the density do not give reliable results for the absolute value of the density , which strongly depends on the uv cutoff and is expected to get a sizeable contribution from three  particle interactions .",
    "we observe that the momentum integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : density ] ) is dominated by high momenta @xmath171 and is therefore strongly affected by the choice of the cutoff .",
    "furthermore , this implies that the precise momentum dependence of the propagators @xmath117 and @xmath118 could also have a substantial influence on the value of the density .",
    "the temperature dependence of the density , on the other hand , is dominated by @xmath157 .",
    "we thus allow for an overall shift of the density and only calculate its temperature dependence .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] .",
    "they reproduce the qualitative picture of the density close to the phase transition .",
    "the peak at @xmath172 is clearly visible as well as the slightly negative thermal  expansion coefficient for @xmath173 .",
    "the fact that our calculations deviate substantially above the critical temperature is due to the crude treatment of the wave  function renormalization @xmath174 . in the present approach ,",
    "we have used @xmath175 and @xmath176 . for a more reliable treatment , the wave  function renormalizations @xmath177 and @xmath178 in @xmath117 and @xmath118",
    "should be replaced by momentum ",
    "dependent functions @xmath179 , @xmath180 .",
    "we are aware that the simplifications @xmath175 and @xmath176 are less appropriate for the temperature dependence of the density , for which the integral is dominated by @xmath157 . in the vicinity of the phase transition ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath181 from the fluctuation integral ( [ eq : density ] ) scales roughly @xmath182 . replacing @xmath133 by @xmath183",
    ", @xmath184 leads to a less pronounced temperature dependence if @xmath185 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath54 near @xmath172 , critical fluctuations influence the behavior of @xmath174 and @xmath186 at low @xmath132 .",
    "we believe that our crude treatment of the wave  function renormalization constitutes the most important source of error in determining the temperature dependence of the density .",
    "we nevertheless see that we obtain qualitatively correct results , which are stable against shifting the uv cutoff .",
    "since the temperature dependence of the density is not a universal critical quantity , an understanding of the momentum and temperature dependence of @xmath179 is mandatory for a quantitative prediction .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : zoft ] where we show the temperature dependence of a momentum  independent @xmath187 that would be needed for a reproduction of the experimental data . ( the latter may be viewed as an effective @xmath54dependent mean value of @xmath179 , which yields the same @xmath132 integral  ( [ eq : density ] ) as the true @xmath179 . )",
    "this curve seems reasonable , including the modest feature near @xmath172 . using the dotted curve of fig .  [",
    "fig : zoft ] as an approximation to these @xmath187 values still leads to considerable deviations from the observed density in the immediate vicinity of @xmath172 , demonstrating the high precision to which @xmath174 has to be known .",
    "another question why more precision on the wave  function renormalizations will be needed concerns the calculation of the excitation spectrum and the sound velocity .",
    "this requires an understanding of the @xmath132 dependence of the inverse full propagator @xmath29 and thus strongly depends on @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "we have computed thermodynamic properties of a strongly interacting system near a second  order phase transition from `` first principles '' .",
    "starting from the microphysical interactions , we have determined the macroscopic thermodynamic potential for helium4 near the superfluid phase transition .",
    "our method is based on an exact renormalization group equation .",
    "the critical exponents obtained by this approach agree well with more elaborate state  of  the  art calculations and measurements .",
    "our most robust nonuniversal result , the critical chemical potential , is also in good agreement with experiment . it supports our computation of the microphysical action by which helium4 is described in the language of functional integrals .",
    "this action contains an additive shift of the chemical potential that has not been considered so far .    for quantitatively convincing results of the equation of state",
    ", one needs to improve the treatment of the uv cutoff as well as additional effects of higher matsubara frequencies beyond those that we have taken into account in the schwinger  dyson formalism .",
    "a more accurate treatment of the wave  function renormalization is required as well .",
    "qualitatively , though , we reproduce important features of the equation of state such as the density peak at the phase transition .",
    "we emphasize that we treat here a temperature range where collective effects and critical behavior are crucial and where many previous methods are plagued by severe infrared problems . despite certain quantitative shortcomings , this work may be viewed as a demonstration that _ ab initio _ computations of the equation of state become possible with modern renormalization  group techniques ."
