    "understanding the effect of cluster environment on galaxy formation and evolution is a central topic in extragalactic astronomy . a galaxy falling into the dense environment of a galaxy cluster experiences many high - speed encounters with the cluster members and tidal interactions with the dark matter halo of the cluster , leading to the removal of gas and disk destabilization ( galaxy harassment , * ?",
    "at the same time , the hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) interacts with the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy and strips off its gas reservoir through ram pressure ( ram pressure stripping , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the galaxy loses a large fraction of the halo gas as it moves through the cluster , resulting in a gradual decline of star formation as it slowly runs out of fuel ( strangulation , * ? ? ?",

    "the ks - test probability of stellar mass and metallicity distribution of cluster members and the local comparison sample to be derived from the same parent population is @xmath103% and @xmath101% respectively .",
    "this implies that the mass - metallicity distribution of rxj1532 + 30 and the local comparison sample are subsamples of the same parent population .",
    "we perform a linear fit to derive the mzr relation for our data because the turnover mass in @xcite model is poorly constrained for our data due to the stellar mass cut at @xmath104 .",
    "the mzr for clusters ( figure [ fig : mz_dis ] : red curve ) was fit using the same slope as derived from the sdss sample ( figure [ fig : mz_dis ] : blue curve ) .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the mzr of the sdss sample is 0.13 dex .",
    "we observe an offset of 0.2 dex between the mean offset in metallicity of macs1115 + 01 and the local comparison sample ( figure [ fig : mz_dis ] : left panel ) .",
    "student s t - test shows the probability of an offset of 0.2 dex by chance in the metallicity of macs1115 + 01 is less than 1% . in contrast , for rxj1532 + 01 the mean metallicity offset is only 0.03 dex and the student s t - test probability of a chance offset is 88% , confirming the statistical insignificance of the offset .",
    "thus , the cluster members for macs1115 + 01 show enhanced metallicity at a fixed stellar mass , implying the cluster environment plays a significant role in driving the chemical evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "the metallicity offset in macs1115 + 01 ( @xmath105 dex ) is significantly higher than the metallicity offset observed in any previous studies of the mzr in the field versus cluster galaxy sample .",
    "in contrast , the mzr for rxj1532 + 30 is consistent to the local comparison sample .",
    "earlier studies of the mzr in cluster versus field galaxy samples constrain the environmental dependence to be around @xmath106 dex @xcite , significantly less than the metallicity offset observed for macs1115 + 01 .",
    "however , the cluster galaxy sample for studying the environmental dependence of the mzr is usually collected from a large number of clusters without considering the internal variations among the galaxy clusters .",
    "combining the metallicity data from multiple clusters might be responsible for the non - detection of a metallicity difference between field and cluster galaxies in previous studies .",
    "the extremely different mzr for macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 in our observations supports this hypothesis .",
    "we observe an anti - correlation between the cluster member metallicity and projected distance for macs1115 + 01 ( figure [ fig : z_dis ] : left panel ) .",

    "01 is @xmath108 with a significance of @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the spearman rank probability of no correlation between the metallicity and the projected distance is 2.1% for macs1115 + 01 .",
    "the observed metallicity gradient is unlikely to be driven by the stellar mass of galaxies because we do not observe correlation between stellar mass and projected distance ( spearman s rank of @xmath110 , corresponding to a significance of 0.8@xmath111 ) . to further disentangle the effect of mass and environment on the metallicity gradient",
    ", we analyze the offset in metallicity from the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "the metallicity offset also shows a negative correlation with projected distance for macs1115 + 01 , albeit within the limitation of our small sample size ( see appendix [ sec : met_offset ] ) .    to quantify the probability of observing a negative abundance gradient due to the intrinsic scatter in the mzr ( 0.13 dex ) , we bootstrap the data to generate a sample of cluster galaxies with a random stellar mass distribution in the cluster .",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution with a sigma of 0.13 dex for the offset from the mass - metallicity relation . the probability of observing a metallicity gradient of @xmath112 dex / mpc caused by the 0.13 dex scatter in the mzr is only 0.1% .",
    "therefore , the observed metallicity gradient is unlikely to be driven by the intrinsic scatter in the mzr .",
    "the metallicity versus projected distance distribution for rxj1532 + 30 ( figure [ fig : z_dis ] : right panel ) is different from macs1115 + 01 .",
    "a slight positive gradient ( @xmath113 ) was derived for rxj1532 + 30 using robust linear regression .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient for rxj1532 + 30 is @xmath114 with a significance of 0.87 i.e. , the probability of no correlation between the metallicity and the projected distance is @xmath115% .",
    "thus , the metallicity gradient in rxj1532 + 30 is statistically flat considering all observed cluster members .",
    "interestingly , the metallicity versus projected distance for rxj1532 + 30 seems to show two branches . if we exclude the low - mass galaxies ( @xmath116 ) , the linear regression for the rest of the cluster members yields a negative metallicity gradient of @xmath117 ( figure [ fig : bimodal ] : dashed line ; hereafter upper branch ) .",
    "similar linear regression fitting for the low - mass galaxies ( @xmath118 ) yields a positive abundance gradient of @xmath119 ( figure [ fig : bimodal ] : dotted line ; hereafter lower branch ) .",
    "our observations indicate that the lower - mass galaxies constituting the positive radial gradient are either interlopers or a group of in - plane mergers from a sub - cluster ( further discussed in section [ sec : dis_grad ] ) .",
    "we present the first detections of negative radial gradients in the gas - phase metallicity of galaxies in cluster environment .",
    "we survey two clash clusters , macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 , with the deimos / keck - ii detecting 22 and 36 cluster members for each respectively .",
    "the gas - phase metallicities are derived for a sample of 12 and 16 star - forming galaxies in macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 respectively , using strong emission line diagnostics .      even though macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 are both massive clusters with @xmath120 , the observed metallicity distribution is significantly different .",
    "the gas - phase metallicities of star - forming galaxies in macs1115 + 01 exhibit an anti - correlation with projected distance , with a gradient of @xmath107 ( figure [ fig : z_dis ] : left panel ) , whereas the metallicity distribution of rxj1532 + 30 with projected distance is suggested to be bimodal ( figure [ fig : z_dis ] : right panel ) . in addition , the mzr of macs1115 + 01 exhibits an elevated metallicity by 0.2 dex for cluster members as compared to the local sdss sample ( figure [ fig : mz_dis ] : left panel ) .",
    "in contrast , the mzr of rxj1532 + 30 is statistically consistent with the local comparison sample ( figure [ fig : mz_dis ] : right panel ) .",
    "contrary to x - ray morphology studies that conclude the relaxed nature of both clusters @xcite , the redshift distribution from our study indicates that the two clusters have different dynamical states .",
    "a standard ks - test suggests the redshift distribution of rxj1532 + 30 is non - gaussian as opposed to the gaussian redshift distribution of macs1115 + 01 .",
    "the comparison of virial mass estimated from the velocity dispersion measurement of our observations to the virial mass estimated from weak lensing also suggests differences in the dynamical state . from the velocity dispersion",

    "mass is @xmath99 from velocity dispersions , about 6 times larger than the lensing mass ( @xmath123 , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the presence of radio mini - halos and the inhomogeneity in large scale x - ray temperature distributions in rxj1532 also indicate possible unrelaxed dynamics @xcite .",
    "the two branches in the radial metallicity distribution of rxj1532 + 30 could be the result of a minor merger with a cooler sub - cluster or a group of interloper galaxies .",
    "the upper branch ( @xmath124 ) cluster members of rxj1532 + 30 exhibit a negative abundance gradient with a slope matching the metallicity gradient of macs1115 + 01 ( figure [ fig : z_dis ] , figure [ fig : bimodal ] ) .",
    "however , the lower branch galaxies ( @xmath125 ) exhibit a positive metallicity gradient .",
    "the existence of low mass galaxies in a separate substructure is confirmed by a virial mass analysis .",
    "we measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath126 km s@xmath127 for rxj1532 + 30 after excluding the lower branch galaxies , which estimates the virial mass for rxj1532 + 30 to be @xmath128 .",
    "the estimated virial mass after excluding the lower branch galaxies is consistent with the lensing mass within 1-sigma errors , suggesting that the low - mass galaxies belong to a separate substructure and/or are a population of interloper galaxies .",
    "the possibility of a minor merger between a cooler sub - cluster and rxj1532 + 30 was first suggested by @xcite based on the spatial asymmetry in the large scale x - ray temperature of rxj1532 + 30 .",
    "we hypothesize that the upper branch galaxies ( @xmath124 ) belong to the dynamically relaxed massive component of the cluster rxj1532 + 30 , with a metallicity gradient similar to the dynamically relaxed cluster macs1115 + 01 .",
    "the lower branch galaxies belonging to a merging cooler sub - cluster and/or interloper galaxies that are misidentified as cluster galaxies due to projection effects . to understand whether projection effects play a role in our metallicity gradient measurements , we compare our results with the metallicity gradient from rhapsody - g simulations .",
    "we compare our data to the rhapsody - g simulations performed with the ramses @xcite adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) because the mass rage of simulated clusters matches the mass of observed clusters .",

    ", the simulations used for our comparison have ` r4k resolution ' : dark matter particle mass @xmath135 m@xmath136 ; initial baryonic matter resolution element @xmath137 m@xmath136 ; maximum resolution reached in these simulations is @xmath138 kpc ( in physical units ) .",
    "gas cooling , star formation , metal enrichment from supernovae , supernova feedback and agn feedback are included in rhapsody - g .",
    "these simulations successfully reproduce the mass distribution , baryonic abundances , cool core / non - cool core dichotomy and sz properties of observed clusters @xcite .",
    "we select simulated cluster member galaxies with star formation rate greater than @xmath139 to best compare with the observations of metallicity gradient .",
    "note that the absolute metallicity of the simulations is lower than that of observations , therefore we can not directly compare the absolute simulated and observed metallicities .",
    "this offset may be related to the observational metallicity calibration used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we do not compare the impact of environment on the mass - metallicity relation in simulations because there are no field galaxies in the simulations .",
    "however , we can investigate signatures of relative metallicities , such as metallicity gradients , in the rhapsody - g simulations .",
    "we note that a direct comparison with the simulations of @xcite , who use a sophisticated supernova feedback and chemical evolution prescription , was not possible because their current simulations do not contain relaxed clusters on the mass scales of interest here .",
    "we select the simulated galaxy cluster , which has the closest value of concentration to the observations .",
    "the concentration is a proxy for the age and dynamical state of the cluster @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the concentration parameter of the simulations ( @xmath140 , where the @xmath141 is the virial radial and @xmath142 is the scale radius of the density profile of the cluster ) to match with the observations .",
    "both macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 have similar concentration parameters resulting in the selection of the halo-377 for both clusters .",
    "observationally , the similar concentration of macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 does not fully rule out the dynamically unrelaxed nature of rxj1532 + 30 because concentration is not strongly affected by minor merger events .",
    "the comparison simulated cluster exhibits a negative abundance gradient of @xmath143 ( figure [ fig : sim_clus ] ) .",
    "the negative metallicity gradient in the simulation is not driven by the stellar mass in accordance with the mass - independent abundance gradient of our observations .",
    "the existence of a negative metallicity gradient in simulations confirms that the observed metallicity gradient is not a projection effect , but the shallower slope may be related to a lack of information about the projection axis of the observed clusters .",
    "our future work will include a comprehensive analysis of the projection effects on the observed metallicity gradient using simulations ( gupta et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .        a galaxy moving through the dense environment of the galaxy cluster experiences galaxy harassment and ram pressure stripping , resulting in truncation of the outer galactic - disk .",
    "although , the metallicity measurements via strong emission lines are biased towards the high surface brightness regions , the truncation of the outer - galactic disk can enhance the bias in metallicity measurements to the inner metal - rich galactic - disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , as the galaxy falls into the galaxy cluster , a consecutive decrease in the galactic - disk size as a result of the loss of outer - disk due to ram pressure stripping or galaxy harassment , would result in successive high metallicity measurements in spatially non - resolved observations . this effect might play a role in causing the observed negative abundance gradient in the global metallicity of star - forming cluster members .",
    "morphological changes in the galaxy as a function of radial distance are a direct consequence of the galactic - disk destabilization / truncation due to galaxy harassment and/or ram pressure stripping .",
    "unfortunately , the existing imaging data from cfht and sdss is not deep enough to observe these morphological changes , and hst data only spans the inner @xmath6300 kpc of the cluster .",
    "thus , we require deeper imaging data in the outskirts of galaxy clusters to observe the morphological changes in star - forming galaxies with radial distance .",
    "separating the effect of ram pressure and galaxy harassment is impossible with the current sample , as both galaxy clusters in our current sample are x - ray luminous .",
    "future metallicity gradient observations with a broader sample of x - ray luminous ( ram pressure dominant ) and the x - ray non - luminous ( galaxy harassment dominant ) clusters can help to distinguish the relative role of ram - pressure stripping and galaxy harassment .",
    "finally , in order to understand the effect of disk truncation on metallicity gradients , deep imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopic observations are required .",
    "in addition to disk truncation due to ram pressure stripping or galaxy harassment , the icm also strips the galaxy of the loosely bound hot / warm halo gas ( fuel for future star formation ) . depriving the galaxy of a fresh supply of gas results in a gradual decline in star formation as the galaxy consumes its existing cold gas reservoir ( strangulation , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the dilution from the inflowing pristine gas in the strangulation mode does not exist , which results in self - enrichment of the galaxy as it goes through successive cycles of star formation . assuming the infall time - scale for galaxies in inner region of the cluster is greater than the infall time - scale for galaxies in the outskirts , the star - forming galaxies in the inner regions , which have undergone more cycles of star formation would be more metal rich compared to galaxies in outskirts .",
    "thus , preferential self - enrichment of galaxies in the inner regions of the cluster as compared to the galaxies in the outskirts can also generate the observed negative abundance gradient . in order to study the self enrichment of galaxies in galaxy clusters due to strangulation ,",
    "we require integral field spectroscopy of a mass - matched sample of star - forming cluster galaxies at different cluster - centric distances .    the stellar mass of a galaxy will also increase during self - enrichment via strangulation @xcite .",
    "therefore , preferential self - enrichment of galaxies in the inner regions of the cluster as compared to the galaxies in the outskirts should result in a direct correlation between the stellar mass and cluster - centric distance .",
    "the lack of an apparent stellar mass segregation for emission line galaxies might be a result of one or more of the following : ( i ) selective removal of massive quenched galaxies due to our sample bias towards star - forming galaxies , ( ii ) mass growth as a function of infall time depends on the details of star formation history , such as mergers and ram pressure - enhanced star formation rate @xcite , ( iii ) projection effects leads to uncertainty in radial distance measurement ( discussed in the subsequent subsection ) .",
    "observational measurements of the absolute cluster - centric distance are impossible , we only have information about the projected distance of a galaxy in a triaxial cluster halo . adding the line of sight velocity of the galaxy relative to the galaxy cluster can reduce the uncertainty in the absolute cluster - centric distance measurement .",
    "a recent study by @xcite uses a projected phase space diagram to separate the cluster members into groups of accreted versus infalling galaxies .",
    "adding the line of sight velocity via the projected phase - space diagram does not improve the signature of mass segregation for star - forming galaxies in our observations ( figure [ fig : phase_space ] ) .",
    "in addition , the low mass cluster members for rxj1532 + 30 ( lower branch on figure [ fig : bimodal ] ) do not occupy any special location on the projected phase - space diagram ( figure [ fig : phase_space ] : right panel ) , which we propose belongs to an in - plane merging cooler sub - cluster and/or interloper galaxies .",
    "however , even the projected phase - space diagram does not contain full 3 dimensional information about a galaxy cluster , and therefore , is insufficient to rule out the uncertainty in radial distance measurements .",
    "our current simulations do not have sufficient resolution to fully investigate the effects of disk truncation and self - enrichment on the origin of metallicity gradient .",
    "high - resolution simulations would allow us to understand the change in galaxy s properties such as metallicity , stellar mass , fraction of cold and hot gas , as the galaxy falls into the cluster environment .",
    "the existence of resolved low stellar mass galaxies in the high - resolution simulations would provide a better comparison with the observations .",
    "a more detailed analysis of galaxy tracking in simulations with high resolution is required to properly study the effects influencing the metallicity distribution in cluster satellites .",
    "moreover , to fully understand the origin of cluster - scale metallicity gradients , we require metallicity gradient observations with a broader sample of a range of x - ray luminosity and dynamical state .",
    "using the multi - object optical spectrograph deimos on the keck ii , we observe two clash clusters at @xmath0 , macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 .",

    "the mass - metallicity relation of rxj1532 + 30 is consistent with the mass - metallicity relation of local comparison galaxies .",
    "the significant difference between mass - metallicity relation of macs1115 + 01 and rxj1532 + 30 show that the non - detection of metallicity enhancement in galaxy clusters in previous studies might be due to the combination of data from multiple clusters with different mass - metallicity relation .",

    "<S> we use the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii telescope to observe two clash clusters at @xmath0 : macs1115 + 0129 and rxj1532 + 3021 . based on our measured interstellar medium ( ism ) properties of star - forming galaxies out to a radius of @xmath1 from the cluster centre , we find that the galaxy metallicity decreases as a function of projected cluster - centric distance ( @xmath2 ) in macs1115 + 01 . on the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr ) , </S>",
    "<S> star - forming galaxies in macs1115 + 01 are offset to higher metallicity ( @xmath3 ) than the local sdss galaxies at a fixed mass range . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the mzr of rxj1532 + 30 is consistent with the local comparison sample . rxj1532 + 30 exhibits a bimodal radial metallicity distribution , with one branch showing a similar negative gradient as macs1115 + 01 ( @xmath4 ) and the other branch showing a positive radial gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the positive gradient branch in rxj1532 + 30 is likely caused by either interloper galaxies or an in - plane merger , indicating that cluster - scale abundance gradients probe cluster substructures and thus the dynamical state of a cluster . </S>",
    "<S> most strikingly , we discover that neither the radial metallicity gradient nor the offset from the mzr is driven by the stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our observations with rhapsody - g cosmological hydrodynamical zoom - in simulations of relaxed galaxy clusters and find that the simulated galaxy cluster also exhibits a negative abundance gradient , albeit with a shallower slope ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our observations suggest that the negative radial gradient originates from ram - pressure stripping and/or strangulation processes in the cluster environments . </S>"
