    "the existence of intergalactic magnetic fields has been speculated for nearly half a century largely motivated by the observation of micro gauss fields in galaxies and clusters of galaxies  .",
    "a primordial magnetic field can be a crucial ingredient for the formation of stars and galaxies  @xcite and its properties can open a window to the early universe in the domain of very high energy particle interactions of matter  @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising then that substantial theoretical effort has been devoted to discover ways to generate primordial magnetic fields  ( for recent reviews , see ) , understand their implications for the present state of the universe  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and to observe them using an array of tools  ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "until relatively recently , various cosmological observables yielded an upper bound on the magnetic field strength at the nano gauss level  ( e.g. @xcite ) , and blazar observations have placed lower bounds at the @xmath0 level  @xcite .",
    "an important development in the last few years is an appreciation of the importance of magnetic helicity in the generation and evolution of cosmological magnetic fields .",
    "this has led to the exciting possibility to use the cp odd nature of the helicity to discover intergalactic magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "further , the helicity of the intergalactic magnetic field provides an unmistakable handle by which one can study detailed stochastic properties .",
    "we have implemented these ideas to observe and measure the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field and its correlation functions using diffuse gamma ray data from the fermi - lat satellite  @xcite .",
    "our analysis and ( updated ) results are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] where we also test and confirm predictions made in  @xcite .    the successful predictions bolster confidence in the intergalactic magnetic field hypothesis .",
    "yet there are some other tests that are also essential to rule out other more mundane explanations related to the observational techniques .",
    "foremost among these is that fermi - lat observations are not performed uniformly on the sky ; instead different parts of the sky are sampled with ( slightly ) different time exposures .",
    "we now take the time exposure map into account in our monte carlo simulations which we use to calculate statistical error bars .",
    "this results in larger error bars but the signal found in  @xcite persists with high significance .",
    "another test is that fermi - lat provides two data sets for the diffuse gamma ray sky , namely the clean and ultraclean data sets , the former being recommended for analyses of the diffuse background but the latter is the most conservative .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite used the clean data set but , throughout this paper , we use ultraclean , with essentially no change in results .",
    "a third test is that a cosmological signal should be present over the whole sky , in particular it should be seen in both the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "so we analyze the north and south data sets separately .",
    "the results show a much stronger signal in the north and a weaker signal in the south . at present",
    "we do not have a good explanation for the difference in the strengths of the signal .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : qrmh ] we turn our attention to connecting the observed correlator of gamma rays described in sec .  [ sec : review ] to the correlation function of magnetic fields .",
    "the analytical framework has already been set up in @xcite .",
    "we now use that framework to give a `` proof of principles '' reconstruction of the intergalactic magnetic field helical correlator .",
    "we conclude in sec .",

    "to calculate @xmath17 from data , we bin the data in the energy ranges ( 10,20 ) , ( 20,30 ) , ( 30,40 ) , ( 40,50 ) and ( 50,60 )  gev .",

    "these are avoided by only considering @xmath10 photons at very high galactic latitudes , @xmath18 , and by excising a patch of angular radius @xmath19 centered on sources identified in the first lat high - energy catalog  @xcite .     versus @xmath16 for the ultraclean data set for weeks 9 - 328 for @xmath20 .",

    "we show plots of @xmath23 for various energy combinations @xmath24 ; @xmath10 is always taken to be @xmath25 . in these plots",

    "[ sec : exposure ] we will improve on the monte carlo simulations by using the fermi - lat time exposure map .",

    "the plot with @xmath30 and @xmath31 has a peak at @xmath32 .",

    "[ upto30degrees ] , but a clear peak is not present in the @xmath37 plot .",

    "however , as we will see in sec .  [ constructnue ] , at such large angles , the milky way contribution becomes very strong and we do not see any indication of the cosmological signal .",
    "we also note that all the identified peaks in fig .  [ upto30degrees ]",
    "are inverted , as we would expect from magnetic fields with left - handed helicity provided the spectrum is not too steep  @xcite .",

    ", we will consider three cases : ultra - blue spectrum in which the spectrum vanishes at large distances , ultra - red spectrum in which the spectrum vanishes at small distances , and a power law spectrum .    in the case of the ultra - red spectrum , we assume that the spectrum on the smallest length scales vanish : @xmath44 and solve for @xmath45 .",
    "this does not work , however , because the assumption is inconsistent with eq .",
    "( [ simultaneous ] ) , as the left - hand side vanishes while the right - hand side is non - vanishing .",
    "thus , at least with these simple assumptions , the data does not fit an ultra - red spectrum .    in the ultra - blue spectrum case , we set @xmath46 for the larger values of @xmath47 in table  [ dabtable ] .",
    "then @xmath48 and the only non - zero unknowns to solve for are @xmath49 .",
    "the solution is ( d , m)_45 = ( 12,367 ) ,   ( d , m)_34 = ( 18,-75 ) ,   ( d , m)_35 = ( 31,128 ) ,   ( d , m)_24 = ( 49,-93 ) ,  ( ultra - blue  assumption ) [ bluesoln ] where we also show the distance scale of the correlation ( in mpc ) .",
    "next we would like to go from @xmath50 to @xmath51 by using eq .",
    "( [ mabdef ] ) . here",
    "we need to resolve the discrete `` charge ambiguity '' factors @xmath52 . to understand how these factors arise , recall that pair production by tev gamma rays results in electrons and positrons .",
    "these carry opposite electric charges and are bent in opposite ways in a magnetic field .",
    "the cascade gamma rays we eventually observe could have arisen due to inverse compton scattering of an electron or a positron .",
    "this ambiguity is encapsulated in @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the sign of the charge of the particle that resulted in the observed gamma ray of energy @xmath55 .    to determine @xmath52 we work with the assumption that the magnetic helicity power spectrum , @xmath56 , has the same sign over the distance scales of interest .",
    "then there are two cases to consider : @xmath57 or @xmath58 . if we assume @xmath57 , then with the signs of @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ bluesoln ] ) , we get @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "multiplying the first three relations gives @xmath63 , which has no real solutions .",
    "hence there is no consistent solution with @xmath57 . on the other hand , if we assume @xmath58 , we need @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68 is a solution ( with either choice of @xmath69 ) . with this solution ,",
    "we find ( d_ab , |d_ab| m_h(|d_ab| ) = ( 12,-3.7 ) ,   ( 18,-0.7 ) ,   ( 31,-1.3 ) ,   ( 49,-0.9 ) ,  ( ultra - blue  assumption ) where @xmath47 is in mpc and the correlator is in units of @xmath70 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "however , this estimate of the helical power spectrum with the ultra - blue assumption is in tension with the estimate of the magnetic field strength based on the peak location , @xmath71 , since the magnetic helicity density is bounded by the energy density of the magnetic field via the so - called `` realizability condition '' @xcite .",
    "another approach is to assume that the helicity power spectrum has a power law dependence on distance , r m_h(r ) = a ( ) ^p ^2 g^2 and then determine the best fit values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 by minimizing the error function e(a , p ) = _",
    "i=1 ^ 4 ( -1 ) _",
    "i^2 where @xmath74 labels the four simultaneous equations in eq .",
    "( [ simultaneous ] ) , `` lhs '' and `` rhs '' refer to the left - hand side and right - hand side of those equations , and we set @xmath75 .",
    "note that the construction of @xmath76 gives equal weight to the four equations ; for example , if we define the error via @xmath77 , this would give greater weight to equations with larger @xmath78 .",
    "then we obtain the best fit values a = 2.08 ,  p = + 0.56 [ mhbestfit ] which suggests a mildly red spectrum .",
    "we would like to caution the reader that the results of this section depend on the assumption @xmath79 as given in table  [ nuetable ] which is probably not accurate .",
    "the intent of the above analysis is to show that a reconstruction of the helical power spectrum may be possible once a definitive model for @xmath23 is established .",
    "we have re - examined the finding in @xcite that the parity - odd correlator , @xmath23 , of fermi - lat observed gamma rays does not vanish .",
    "we have used the most recent data ( weeks 9 - 328 ) and find that the signal originally found in data up to september 2013 persists and is , in fact , a little stronger ( see  https://sites.physics.wustl.edu/magneticfields/wiki/index.php/search_for_cp_violation_in_the_gamma-ray_sky for a time sequence of results ) .",
    "we have also successfully tested the prediction of a peak in the ( 10,30 ) data around @xmath80 @xcite and the locations of the peaks in the other panels as seen in fig .  [ upto30degrees ] .",
    "building on the model of @xcite , we find that all the peak locations in fig .",
    "[ upto30degrees ] can be explained by a single value of the magnetic field strength : @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ rpeakvsb ] ) .",
    "the plots of @xmath23 in the northern and southern hemispheres separately show similar signals in some energy panels but not in others ( fig .",
    "[ northsouthfig ] ) , for which we do not have an explanation .",
    "the peak amplitudes have then been used to reconstruct the magnetic helicity spectrum under the assumptions of either an ultra - red spectrum or an ultra - blue spectrum .",
    "the assumption of an ultra - red spectrum does not yield a solution ; the assumption of an ultra - blue spectrum yields the helicity power spectrum at four distance scales , however the field amplitude is in tension with the realizability condition .",
    "the sign of the helicity depends on the sign of the charged particles that are responsible for the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons .",
    "we find that this sign ambiguity has a unique resolution if we assume that the spectrum is either everywhere positive or everywhere negative _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 or @xmath58 at all distance scales , in which case the helicity is negative ( left - handed ) .",
    "we have also worked with the assumption that the helicity spectrum is a power law to find the best fit amplitude and exponent as given in eq .",
    "( [ mhbestfit ] ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the power spectrum should be considered a `` proof of principle '' and not a definitive claim since it assumes a noise to signal ratio , @xmath82 , and also certain other assumptions , _",
    "e.g. _ that the helical spectrum does not change sign over the length scales of interest .",
    "we have made several improvements on the analysis to check the robustness of the results .",
    "the change from the fermi - lat clean to ultraclean data set makes no difference to the signal ; the error bars obtained from monte carlo simulations that include the fermi - lat time exposure are larger but the signal is still statistically significant at the @xmath83 level .    another outcome of our analysis in sec .",
    "[ constructnue ] is that the milky way starts contributing to the gamma ray data set at @xmath84 for the 10  gev bin and at yet larger @xmath16 for higher energies ( fig .",
    "[ ntvsr ] ) .",
    "even though our non - trivial signals occur at @xmath85 , this raises the question if the milky way is somehow responsible for the signal we are detecting .",
    "this seems unlikely to us for several reasons :",
    "( i ) we observe a signal even in the ( 30,40 )  gev data set where contamination is seen to be minimal , ( ii ) the signal has a peak structure whereas milky way contamination would presumably lead to a monotonically increasing signal at large @xmath16 , and ( iii ) that the whole pattern of peak locations fits the helical magnetic field hypothesis very well . to further confirm the signal , as more data is accumulated , we could restrict attention to only the higher energies but reduce the bin size , _",
    "e.g. _ in 5  gev bin widths instead of the current 10  gev bins .",
    "the higher energies would limit the milky way contamination and the several ( smaller ) bins would still give us the magnetic helicity spectrum over a range of distance scales .",
