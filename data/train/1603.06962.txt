    "recently , the lhc experiments atlas and cms , have reported an excess of diphoton events at an invariant mass around 750 gev from data at lhc run 2 with @xmath6 collisions at @xmath7 tev @xcite .",
    "the absence of data on other channels such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate that the interpretation of these events can not be accommodated within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it has been suggested that an interpretation requires new physics beyond the known sm context . in fact",
    "this effect hints to the existence of singlets and vector like states in the low energy spectrum of the theory .",
    "the observed resonance could be explained by a sm scalar or pseudoscalar singlet state @xmath10  @xcite with mass @xmath11 gev  .",
    "this state could be generated by the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism while subsequently it decays to two photons .",
    "schematically , this is described as follows gg x[gxgamma ] in a renormalisable theory , the production and decay in this process can be realised through loops involving appropriate vector - like states . remarkably , a common phenomenon in string theory model building is the occurrence of new singlet fields and vector - like exotic states in the massless spectrum of the effective low energy models which can mediate such processes  @xcite   excess . for a comprehensive list of models and interpretations",
    "see  @xcite . ] .",
    "f - theory models in particular offer a wide range of possibilities@xcite . unlike other string constructions",
    ", they admit exceptional gauge symmetries such as @xmath12 and its subgroups , which incorporate naturally the concept of gauge coupling unification . besides",
    ", when most of the successful old gut groups are realised in an f - theory background they naturally predict vector - like pairs of quarks and leptons in the light spectrum .",
    "in fact , when the gut symmetry is @xmath0 or higher the appearance of such states is unavoidable  @xcite .    inspired by the above facts , in this note we construct a flipped @xmath0 model embedded in an f - theory motivated @xmath1 unified gauge group  @xcite .",
    "we show that this construction includes singlets as well as vector - like states which come with the quantum numbers of sm particles capable of mediating processes such as the diphoton production .",
    "in addition , we find that other vector - like states with exotic quantum numbers emerge from the adjoint decomposition .    the study of this alternative embedding is well motivated in f - theory constructions where the gut symmetry can be as large as @xmath13 . indeed , in the restricted case of minimal @xmath14",
    ", there is a unique assignment of the hypercharge generator in this group .",
    "however , there are many possibilities with a larger gut symmetry and includes additional @xmath15 factors . in the case of @xmath16 , with the standard hypercharge assignment the extra @xmath17 factor is treated as a spectator , but there is no compelling reason for this .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath18 case , there are two additional @xmath15 factors that could contribute to the hypercharge .",
    "thus , different embeddings lead to distinct phenomenological predictions . in this work",
    "we wish to consider an alternative embedding of the hypecharge generator and try to assess the model in terms of its low energy predictions .    in order to obtain",
    "chiral matter we will assume the existence of a suitable four - form flux . of course , the flux depends on the choice of the four complex dimensional calabi - yau ( cy ) manifold and the geometric properties of the divisor supporting the specific singularity ( @xmath1 in the present case ) . for our present purposes however , we will work in the spectral cover approach where the properties of our local construction can be adequately described in the infinitesimal vicinity of the gut divisor , and therefore , we will rely on the assumption that such a manifold exists .",
    "the layout of the present paper is as follows . in the next section we present",
    "an @xmath0 flipped model embedded in the @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "we discuss the basic properties of its spectrum and the predicted exotics . in section 3",
    "we derive the superpotential of the effective model emerging under the action of a @xmath19 monodromy .",
    "next , in section 4 we focus on the existence of exotic vector - like pairs and singlet field which are suitable to contribute to the diphoton emission in @xmath6 collisions .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in f - theory the gauge symmetry of the effective theory is linked to the geometric singularity of the compactification manifold . in the elliptic fibration",
    "these singularities are described by the sequence of the subgroups of the exceptional group @xmath12 . in the present f - theory construction",
    "we will analyse an @xmath20 gauge symmetry which admits a natural embedding in the exceptional group @xmath1 . therefore , with respect to the @xmath12 we have the following breaking pattern : @xmath21 where , in accordance to the standard terminology , the @xmath22 factor is considered as the group ` perpendicular ' to @xmath1 gut divisor .",
    "we will assume a semilocal approach where the @xmath1 representations transform non - trivially under @xmath22 .",
    "the matter content arises from the decomposition of the @xmath12 adjoint ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 in the spectral cover approach the @xmath1 representations are distinguised by the ` weights ' @xmath25 of the @xmath22 cartan subalgebra subject to @xmath26 , while the @xmath22 adjoint ` decomposes ' into singlets @xmath27 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath28 while the @xmath1 adjoint @xmath29 is an @xmath22 singlet and therefore carries no @xmath30 index . since we are interested in a flipped @xmath0 model , in the subsequent analysis we choose to accommodate the ordinary fermionic states and higgs in the @xmath31 .",
    "we further assume that the symmetry breaks though a non - trivial abelian flux which , at the same time , determines the chirality of the complete @xmath1 representations @xmath32 .",
    "we start with the derivation of the flipped @xmath0 model   see for example @xcite and references therein . ] in an f - theory inspired context .",
    "we will assume that the bulk gauge group is @xmath1 , which breaks to @xmath0 by turning on a @xmath33 gauge field configuration , where the particular @xmath33 is embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "under the decomposition @xmath34 , the relevant @xmath1 representations decompose as follows _ 6 & & so(10)u(1)_x + 78 & & * 45*_0+*1*_0+*16*_-3+_3[78 ] + 27&&*16*_1+*10*_-2+*1*_4[27 ] + & & _ -1+_2+*1*_-4[27n ] in principle , there are @xmath0 zero modes in the adjoint @xmath35 and @xmath36 as well as in @xmath37 , which might accommodate chiral matter provided that @xmath38 . in the next step ,",
    "we break the @xmath0 symmetry down to @xmath39 by turning on a flux along @xmath40 , so that at this stage the symmetry breaking chain is _",
    "6 so(10)u(1)_x u(1)_x. if we denote with @xmath41 the corresponding abelian charges , for the flipped @xmath0 case we define the following combination   charge assignment , we adopt the convention @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . ]",
    "z=-14 ( x+5 x)[zdef ] under the above symmetry breaking , the @xmath0 representations decompose to various @xmath14 multiplets . with respect to @xmath45 ,",
    "these have the following ` charge ' assignments : 27 & & \\{10_*-1*+_*-2*+1_*0*}+\\{5_*2*+|5_*3*}+*1*_*-5*[27dec ] + 78 & & \\{24_*0*+10_*-1*+_*1*+1_*0 * } + & & + \\{10_*4*+|5_*3*+1_*5 * } + & & + \\{_*-4*+ 5_*-3*+1_*-5 * } + & & + * 1*_*0*[78dec ] at the final stage , we break @xmath46 , where the hypercharge is defined to be the linear combination of the three abelian factors @xmath47",
    "given by : y = -15 ( z+y6 ) [ zydef ]    we will require that the sm fermions and higgs doublets reside on matter curves @xmath48 formed at the intersections of the gut surface with other 7-branes . employing the above hypercharge definition , the embedding of the sm states in the 27-representation of @xmath18 is as follows : & = & \\ {    lll*16*_1 + + * 10*_-2 + * 1*_4e^c    . ,    the symbol @xmath49 stands for a @xmath14 singlet field while for all other sm states , we use the standard notation . as can be seen ,",
    "compared to the standard @xmath0 embedding , here we obtain a ` flipped ' picture of the @xmath50-plet and singlet representations , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "more precisely , compared to flipped @xmath14 , this @xmath53 definition flips @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 . the fermion component @xmath58 in this case",
    "is part of the @xmath59-plet ( @xmath60 ) , and the higgs @xmath61 is part of @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath14 singlet @xmath49 is electrically neutral and the right - handed electron is found in the @xmath0 singlet @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to the sm fields residing in the @xmath48 matter curves , there is also bulk matter emerging from the docomposition of the @xmath29 representation .",
    "namely : & = & \\ {    lll * 45*_0g_0+t_0+s_0+q+ + + \\{(q+d^c+n^c)+c.c.}+_0 + * 16*_-3+|e^c + _ + 3 + e^c + * 1*_0    .. [ 78com ] we have used the symbols @xmath64 for the two neutral singlets , while for the remaining content arising from the decomposition of @xmath65 , we have introduced the notation g_0+t_0+s_0&= & ( 8,1)_0+(1,3)_0+(1,1)_0 + q+|q&= & ( 3,2)_16+(|3,2)_-16 + q+|q&= & ( 3,2)_-56+(|3,2)_56 . in the above , @xmath66 has the standard quark doublet quantum numbers and @xmath67 is its complex conjugate , while @xmath68 have exotic charges .    in the standard ( non - flipped ) @xmath14 theory ,",
    "the @xmath68 exotics emerge from the decomposition of the @xmath69-adjoint .",
    "hence , we observe that the flipped case interchanges @xmath68 exotics in the adjoint of the standard @xmath14 , with the ordinary @xmath70 within the @xmath71 of @xmath0 .",
    "if some of these bulk states remain in the light spectrum , they could contribute to new physics phenomena with possible signatures in future experiments .",
    "we will comment on these issues in the next section .",
    "having determined the particle spectrum of the effective field theory model , we proceed now to the superpotential .",
    "we find it convenient to perform the analysis using the spectral cover approach .",
    "given that there are two non - trivial @xmath1 representations available , namely @xmath37 and @xmath29 , the only possible tree level terms are @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a singlet embedded in the @xmath12 adjoint .",
    "we have explained in the introductory section that in the context of the @xmath76 spectral cover the fundamental representation is characterised by the corresponding weights @xmath30 and the yukawa couplings should respect the requirement @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , as is well known , a monodromy action is required to ensure a top yukawa coupling at the tree - level .",
    "we choose a @xmath19 monodromy , which identifies the two weights @xmath77 .",
    "we accommodate the fermion families in @xmath78 and the higgs in @xmath79 , so that a diagonal yukawa term @xmath80 is allowed . after the implementation of the @xmath19 monodromy , the condition for the weights @xmath30 becomes @xmath81 .",
    "it is also worth observing that the spectral cover symmetry reduces essentially to a @xmath82 symmetry in the effective field theory model where the @xmath82 charges of the two matter curves are @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the symmetry of the effective model is in fact @xmath85    to define the homological properties of the matter curves , we recall that in the case of @xmath22 the spectral cover is described by a cubic polynomial whose roots the @xmath30 . for the case of @xmath19 monodromy",
    "we assume the factorisation  . ]",
    "b_0s^3+b_2s+b_3 = ( a_1+a_2s+a_3s^2 ) ( a_4+a_5 s),[sce ] where the @xmath86 s homologies are @xmath87=\\eta - kc_1 $ ] and @xmath88=c_1 $ ] .",
    "here @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the first chern class of the gut `` surface '' @xmath91 and , @xmath92 that of the normal bundle .",
    "the second degree polynomial of the right part of the above equation means that two roots are not separable within the field of holomorphic functions , and as a result , a @xmath19 monodromy identifies the two weights @xmath93 in accordance with our assumptions stated above .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ sce ] ) implies the following relations @xmath94 between the coefficients b_0=a_3a_5 , b_1=a_2a_5+a_3a_4=0 , b_2=a_1a_5+a_2a_4 , b_3=a_1a_4 , [ bacoefs ] which can be used to determine the homologies of @xmath95 s .",
    "furhermore , the equation @xmath96 of the @xmath37 , implies that the two matter curves @xmath97 and @xmath79 are associated with the defining equations @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .    from  ( [ bacoefs ] ) , we infer that the homologies satisfy relations of the form @xmath87=[a_l]+[a_{8-l - k}]$ ] so that it can be readily found  @xcite that the @xmath97 and @xmath79 homologies are @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively where @xmath102 is left unspecified .",
    "then , assuming a @xmath15 flux piercing these matter curves , the multiplicities of @xmath103 are given by the restrictions @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( with @xmath106 denoting the abelian flux ) .",
    "from this , we deduce that the chiral states of the model are given by @xmath107 and therefore , the unknown homology @xmath102 does not play any rle in the determination of the chiral spectrum . hence , to obtain three chiral families we impose @xmath108 .",
    ".@xmath1 matter curves , their defining equations , the homology classes and the multiplicities in terms of the flux restrictions . [ cols=\"^,^,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a result , they generate the superpotential terms    ( |e^c)_-t_3(e^c)_t_1_31 [ t13 ] .",
    "we identify the @xmath109 gev resonance @xmath10 with the singlet @xmath110 which has the appopriate couplings to give rise to the diphoton diagram shown in figure  [ ggxgg ] .",
    "note that a mixing term @xmath111 would allow an additional channel for the resonance to decay into diphotons through the last coupling in equation  ( [ t13 ] ) .",
    "after supersymmetry breaking in the presence of the scalar @xmath10 , the effective lagrangian contains the terms & = & _ d|ddx+_e|e^ce^cx+12m_x^2xx+a_dxd^*d+ a_exe^c*e^c+ .",
    "we assume here that the singlet field receives a soft mass @xmath112 of the order of the susy breaking scale , @xmath113 are yukawa couplings of order one , and @xmath114 are the trilinear scalar parameters . for a pseudoscalar interaction we should replace the yukawa coupling",
    "according to @xmath115 .",
    "next we provide an estimate of the contributions of the above exotics to the diphoton excess .",
    "we assume that the production mechanism of the scalar resonance is mainly from gluon fusion , mediated by loops of the colour triplets , while its decay is mediated by triplets and ( @xmath116)-pairs as shown in the figure .",
    "the cross section for the scalar mediated process is @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the total width and the center of mass energy ( @xmath119tev ) respectively , and @xmath120 is the parton integral  @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the function representing the gluon distribution inside the proton .",
    "the integral is computed using mstw2008nnlo  @xcite and its numerical value at @xmath123 tev is estimated  @xcite to be @xmath124 .",
    "the partial widths @xmath125 from loops involving fermions and scalars are given by  @xcite(see also@xcite ) & = &    & = & |_fd_r_fq_f^2_fs(_f ) + _ s d_r_sq_s^2 p(_s)|^2 , where @xmath126 is the dynkin index of the colour representation @xmath127 for the triplet ) , @xmath128 is its dimension , @xmath129 the charge and @xmath130 , with @xmath131 for the fermion and scalar masses respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath132 are @xmath133 where  @xcite f()&=&\\ {    ll ^2&>1 + -14(-i)^2;&1    .. for the pseudoscalar contribution , in the above formulae we make the replacements @xmath134 and @xmath135  @xcite .    for a numerical application , we first consider the existence of only one singlet field @xmath10 with mass @xmath136 gev and , for the sake of simplicity , we take a common mass for the various fermion - pairs contributing in the loops .",
    "since the scalar components are expected to be much heavier than the fermions , at this level of approximation their contributions are ignored . in figure  [ xggxgamma ]",
    "we plot the widths @xmath137 and @xmath138 as a function of the mass of the fermion - pairs for two sets of fermion multiplicities for the scalar as well as the pseudoscalar case .",
    "if we ignore the large width suggested by the atlas data , we observe that there are regions of the fermion mass range where @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which are sufficient to interpret the data .",
    "we note in passing that a large decay width allows the exciting possibility of other decay channels including dark matter . in general , however , we expect more than one singlet field with approximately degenerate masses , so that the atlas large width could be explained as an unresolved resonance .",
    "another possibility is to invoke additional couplings in the superpotential such as @xmath141 which permit the resonance to decay into higgsinos , if kinematically possible , or sm higgs via the soft trilinear terms .      before closing",
    ", we would like to make a final comment on the possible existence of additional ` exotic ' matter interactions .",
    "as we have pointed out , exotic matter arises from the decomposition @xmath142 with respect to @xmath143 ( the indices now refer to @xmath33 ) .",
    "we recall that in the twisted model the sm states are in @xmath144 while bulk states are the @xmath35 , and as such they have exotic charges .",
    "such states could pick up masses at a high scale . in case",
    "some of them remain light . due to their large @xmath145-hypercharge",
    ", they can in principle make a significant contribution to the production and decay of the resonance . as can be observed , all these states come in vector - like pairs , and therefore a possible coupling that could make them massive is m_q q|q + .",
    "[ m78 ] since these states carry non - zero ` charges ' under the three @xmath15 s , in principle , non - trivial fluxes might lead to additional chiral states .",
    "nevertheless , a solution to this problem is feasible if certain topological properties are assumed .    indeed , we first recall that the number of states is given by the euler character @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath146 is the dual representation of @xmath147 , @xmath148 is the bundle transforming in the representation @xmath149 , the net number of chiral minus anti - chiral states is given in terms of the formula  @xcite , @xmath150 where we assume @xmath91 to be a del pezzo surface associated with the gauge group @xmath151 . if we designate with @xmath152 a line bundle over @xmath91 , the euler character is ( s , l_j)&=&1 + 12 c_1(l_j)c_1(l_j)+12 c_1(l_j)c_1(s ) + ( s , l_j^*)&=&1 + 12 c_1(l_j)c_1(l_j)-12 c_1(l_j)c_1(s ) , so that the difference counting the number of chiral states is ( s , l_j^*)-(s , l_j)=- c_1(l_j)c_1(s)[nochiral ] we can ensure the vector - like nature of the corresponding states by simply demanding c_1(l_j)c_1(s)=0[cond4vpairs ] for the particular line bundle .    focusing now on the @xmath18 case , recall that under the successive breaking we have considered @xmath153 while the quantum numbers of the bulk states are 78 & & ( 1,1)_(0,0,0)+\\{(1,1)_(0,0,0)+(1,1)_(0,0,0)+(8,1)_(0,0,0)+(1,3)_(0,0,0)+(3,2)_(-5,0,0)+(|3,2)_(5,0,0 ) .",

    "moreover , in the minimal case the extra states emerging from  @xmath29 can assemble in a @xmath155 pair @xmath156 as already stated , these can receive a large mass from terms such as  ( [ m78 ] ) , so that gauge coupling unification is not affected .     and @xmath157 as a function of the masses of the fermion - pairs circulating in the loops of figure  [ ggxgg].,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath157 as a function of the masses of the fermion - pairs circulating in the loops of figure  [ ggxgg].,title=\"fig : \" ]    * note added * :     after this paper was submitted for publication the atlas and cms experiments have reported results based on updated analysis including data collected during 2016 .",
    "this data does not support the presence of the 750 gev resonance previously reported in 2015 and in moriond 2016 .",
    "we should emphasize that our string inspired @xmath18 model predicts the existence of the diphoton resonance as well as vectorlike fields .",
