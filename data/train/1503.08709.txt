    "one of the crucial tasks of quantum gravity is to understand the singularities in general relativity .",
    "when we consider the initial singularity of our universe @xcite , the problem is related to various issues of physical cosmology , e.g. , the origin of the emergence of time , the initial condition of inflation , the typicalness of our universe , etc . to deal with these issues ,",
    "the traditional approach is to investigate the canonical quantization and to study the wave function of the universe @xcite .    after invoking the canonical quantization that includes the metric ,",
    "what we eventually obtain is the master wave equation , the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "this equation is a partial differential equation and hence it requires boundary conditions .",
    "we do not know what should be the correct boundary condition , but perhaps the ground state of the universe can be a reasonable choice .",
    "hartle and hawking ( hh ) @xcite suggested that the euclidean path integral provides a good analog of the ground state wave function .",
    "for cosmological applications , the @xmath0 symmetric metric ansatz would be a good simplification ; and the euclidean path integral can be approximated by the steepest - descent approximation , or by sum - over instantons .",
    "when we consider the euclidean instantons , we need to complexify the time and hence every fields should be complexified by analyticity @xcite .",
    "however , as long as the field is complex - valued , classical properties can never be restored in terms of equations of motion .",
    "therefore , after the wick rotation , the reality of the metric and the matter field is required : this is the _ _ classicality _ _ condition @xcite .",
    "already some techniques have been investigated to calculate hh instantons and to estimate the probability distribution of each initial conditions @xcite .",
    "typical expectations of the hh wave function are as follows : ( 1 ) it provides slow - roll inflation to obtain a classical history and ( 2 ) it does not prefer large number of @xmath1-foldings .",
    "the former is useful , but the latter is not a good news for inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , if one considers more sophisticated models , this difficulty can be resolved .",
    "note that when our universe begins , all field should be realized and satisfy the classicality condition .",
    "we envision that there exists some fields that in the early universe : an inflaton ( or inflatons ) that induces inflation , heavy mass fields and light mass fields compared with the inflaton .",
    "regarding such a setting , the followings should be noticed .    *",
    "if the mass scales of the fields are similar , then it is reasonable that these fields are equally excited at the same time .",
    "this may be related to the assisted inflation of multi - fields that can help to prefer large @xmath1-foldings @xcite . * if there is a much heavier mass field ( or fields ) , then in order to classicalize the heavier mass field , the lighter field should be excited @xcite .",
    "this excited lighter field can in principle be the inflaton field , which may further explain the preference of sufficiently large @xmath1-foldings .",
    "* some modifications of the gravity sector in the early universe may help to prefer large @xmath1-foldings @xcite .",
    "while this is not yet settled , it is fair to say that the hh wave function remains a reasonable theoretical basis for our inflationary universe @xcite .",
    "if so , then the natural next question is , what will happen to the much lighter fields compared with the inflaton ?",
    "of course , at once they exist from the beginning , then these light fields should be regarded as a part of instanton .",
    "at the first glimpse , it is natural to assume that these light fields should be classicalized , too .",
    "however , if a field is decoupled from our phenomenological fields ( standard model particles ) and the amount of energy of this field is much smaller than that of the inflaton field , then even though the field is not classicalized , there is no way to distinguish the light field during and after the primordial inflation .",
    "as time goes on , however , the super slow - rolling and non - classicalized field can leave some distinguishable effects in the universe around the dark energy dominated era .",
    "this is a kind of ` residue ' from the quantum gravity .",
    "then can we see these effects in this universe ?",
    "( regarding this topic , for extended calculations , see @xcite . )    motivated by this scenario , in this paper we study the properties of a field that has _",
    "negligible amount of energy _ compared to the inflaton , which is _ super slow - rolling _ and _ non - classicalized_. by non - classicalized , we mean that the scalar field is not entirely realized from complex values ( following the notion of classicality in @xcite ) .",
    "although this field has the form of a quintessence field , however , due to its non - classicalicity , some part of this field will also possess the phantom behavior .",
    "therefore , effects of the non - classicalized field can be very well - embedded in a quintessence + phantom dark energy model , i.e. , the quintom model @xcite .",
    "this quintum model is known to be useful to investigate late time cosmology , especially in order to explain the crossing phenomenon of the dark energy equation of state over the cosmological constant boundary .",
    "now the question is this : if there remain effects from a non - classicalized field as a quintum model , then what will be the signatures to our late time universe ? this is the task of this paper .",

    "planck__2015 tt+lowp ) could be closer to @xmath168 , for example @xmath181 based on _",
    "power spectra , _ planck _ lensing , and external data @xcite . ] and @xmath182 ( @xmath183 , _ _",
    "planck__2013 ) @xcite .",
    "left : evolution of the equation of state @xmath167 with respect to @xmath184 in our model , where @xmath185 is the classicalized scale factor of our universe .",
    "right : evolution of the energy density fraction of dark energy @xmath174 with respect to @xmath184 in our model . in the numerical study",
    ", we choose @xmath186 ( black ) , @xmath187 ( red ) , @xmath188 ( blue ) respectively , while @xmath189 .",
    "initial conditions : @xmath190 ( black ) , @xmath191 ( red ) , @xmath192 ( blue ) , @xmath193 ( black ) , @xmath194 ( red ) , @xmath195 ( blue ) , @xmath196 ( black ) , @xmath197 ( red ) , @xmath198 ( blue ) , @xmath199 ( black ) , @xmath200 ( red ) , @xmath201 ( blue ) . ]",
    "one important remark is that this model can also be free from the big rip singularity . according to @xcite , when the universe is dominated by the dark energy with @xmath167 , the time scale @xmath202 for the universe to be of size @xmath31 is approximately @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the current hubble parameter and @xmath205 is the current density fraction of matter in our universe .",
    "a big rip singularity occurs when @xmath206 , which will cause : @xmath207 since in our scenario when dark energy dominates the universe ( @xmath208 ) , @xmath167 already always converges to ( or larger than ) @xmath168 , and therefore it must correspond to the condition that @xmath202 goes to infinity .",
    "that is , it is impossible for the big rip singularity to occur in a finite time in the future .    in summary , through an explicit example , we showed that our hartle - hawking instanton solution can be applied to late time cosmology , with the light fields behaving as phantom and quintessence fields in the quintom model . since there exist a future attractor where @xmath139 , the big rip singularity is also avoided .",
    "thus one may say that hartle - hawking interpretation of the quantum universe can also provide a theoretical basis for the quintom dark energy models , whose eos can cross the ccb .",
    "the ground state wave function can be represented by the euclidean path integral @xcite @xmath209 = \\int \\mathcal{d}g_{\\mu\\nu } \\mathcal{d}\\phi \\ ; e^{-s_{\\mathrm{e}}}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this euclidean analytic continuation is the origin to introduce complexified fields .",
    "the necessity to introduce complexified fields is very clear from some examples , by comparing calculations using instantons and using quantum field theory in de sitter space @xcite .",
    "these complexified fields are not a problem in general , since we require the reality at the endpoint of the path integral ( e.g. , asymptotic future infinity )",
    ".    however , a problem appears in our universe , since we are not _ at the endpoint _ but _ in the process_. if _ we are not seeing the exact endpoint _ , then it is allowed to see some effects of the imaginary part of a field , i.e. , a ghost - like behavior of a scalar field .",
    "since the instanton approximates this wave function , it already contains quantum contributions .",
    "hence , the instanton and its imaginary part are an _ emergent result _ of the entire path integral .",
    "can we find an analog of this phenomenon ?",
    "hawking radiation can be an example .",
    "hawking radiation can be interpreted by using a particle propagator @xcite .",
    "the particle propagator can be approximated by a classical path over the euclidean analytic continuation .",
    "this process can be interpreted as follows : a particle comes out from the event horizon backward in time ( or oppositely , one can say that a negative energy particle comes into the black hole forward in time ) and the same energy particle is detected at the asymptotic future infinity .",
    "the classicality will be imposed at the future infinity ; but as long as a particle moves backward in time , the bulk description can not be classical .",
    "now if we cut a cauchy surface including inside the event horizon , the cauchy surface includes ghost - like particles .",
    "this can be conceptually related to the fact that the renormalized energy - momentum tensor @xmath210 can violate the null energy condition around the horizon . even though the null energy condition is violated",
    ", it does not cause a serious instability , since the effects of the negative energy are emergent results from the entire path integral .    of course , there are some conceptual differences between black hole physics and cosmology . for a black hole case ,",
    "the renormalized energy - momentum tensor is an averaged result @xmath210 , not an independent instanton . on the other hand , for a cosmological case , we are in a special universe and hence we should see a special and independent instanton",
    "can we justify this phenomenon further ?",
    "we remain this for a future work .",
    "however , in conclusion , it seems that if our universe could be phantom - like ( i.e. , @xmath211 ) , this hartle - hawking inspired quintom model can be a _ legal _ way to justify phantomness in terms of quantum physics .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the hartle - hawking wave function with a two - scalar - field model .",
    "this wave function is well approximated by summing over instantons . in general",
    ", these instantons will be complexified , but in order to obtain a well - defined probability , one needs to require the classicality of each instanton , i.e. , all fields should be realized at infinity .",
    "however , as long as we are an observer not at infinity but at a finite time , it is permissible to observe the imprints of the imaginary part of the fields .    in order to embed this possibility to the late time cosmology",
    ", we assumed two massive canonical scalar fields ( @xmath64 is an inflaton and @xmath21 has a slower direction ) plus a cosmological constant with some physical conditions imposed : ( 1 ) initially the energy contribution of @xmath64 is dominant over @xmath21 and ( 2 ) after @xmath64 decays , @xmath21 still satisfies the over - damped condition . then during primordial inflation , the scale factor @xmath31 and the inflaton field @xmath64 will be realized sufficiently ; and as long as the first condition is satisfied , even if @xmath21 is not realized , the realization of @xmath31 and @xmath64 can still be robust .",
    "then all effects of @xmath21 can be negligible during inflation ; as our universe approaches the dark energy dominated era , however , the non - classical and super - slow - roll scalar field will contribute to the equation of state . if the amplitude of the imaginary part of @xmath21 is larger than that of the real part of @xmath21 , then @xmath211 can be attained . however , as time goes on , all real and imaginary parts must decay to zero , and hence the eos will either cross the cosmological constant boundary @xmath139 then reduce to it , having a quintom - like behavior , or go to @xmath168 directly like phantom models . in either of the two ways",
    ", the eos only stays below @xmath168 for a finite time , so there should be no concern about the big rip singularity problem . thus our model has shown that hartle - hawking wave function can be viewed as a theoretical basis and a possible origin of the quintom dark energy models in late time cosmology .",
    "usually , the phantomness can be easily introduced by a ghost field .",
    "however , a ghost field causes perturbative instability , and hence physically disallowed @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the imaginary part of a scalar field behaves as a ghost field with negative kinetic energy ; but this term came from a non - perturbative effect of the entire wave function .",
    "therefore , we may say that this phantomness can be an emergent effect of quantum gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we only restricted to quadratic potential , but in principle it can be generalized to various potentials based on different motivations .",
    "in addition , one may apply the same philosophy to investigate other physical phenomena such as black holes .",
    "if further investigations can indeed establish the connection between dark energy and the non - classicallized instantons , then this would be the first evidence of effects emergent from quantum gravity .",
