    "to meet the goals outlined in the ska science case ( available on www.ras.ucalgary.ca/ska ) , astronomers have drafted the following specifications for the ska : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "except for a few pulsars , the precision of pulsar timing is presently limited by sensitivity rather than systematics , uncalibrated instrumental effects or unmodelled drifts in the pulsar signal . sensitivity will no longer be a problem with the ska and systematics will dominate . trying to assess what sort of timing precision is achievable is therefore quite difficult , because we can not characterise the systematics yet or know whether they can be dealt with .",
    "pulsar timing is limited by systematics around 1 @xmath1s or a bit below .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the ska would allow a large number ( perhaps 100 s ) of pulsars to be timed to this level of precision . using 1 beam it might required something like 10 hours to obtain suitable data to time 500 pulsars at the 1 @xmath1s level . using 10 beams that could be randomly positioned",
    ", it would take only 1 hour .",
    "whether the precision can be pushed well below 1 @xmath1s remains to be seen . as discussed by britton at this meeting poor calibration of polarisation",
    "is a dominant systematic effect at present and the invariant profile method he proposes should to help solve that problem .",
    "however , the ska is likely to have a planar phased array either in the aperture plane or the focal plane",
    ". the polarisation characteristics of these devices are substantially different to anything we are currently use for timing pulsars",
    ". it would be advisable for somebody to do some experiments to see how well we can do pulsar timing with such systems .",
    "another question is the number of pulses ( normally 100 s ) needed to form a stable profile for timing .",
    "this may limit the speed with which a group of pulsars can be timed with the ska .",
    "what others things may be possible with the ska that are not possible now .",
    "of course there will be many that we can not yet think of , but it does not hurt to mention a few of those that we know now .",
    "simultaneous multi frequency , multi pulsar studies will be a lot easier .",
    "the ska will make it possible to do single pulse studies for a large number of pulsars , compared to the handful at present .",
    "one interesting possibility arises if the ska is made using a planar phased array or luneberg lens .",
    "one could collect signals from every element and store them in a fifo buffer of say 1 hour in length . in the mean time , collect timing points on pulsars that are likely to glitch .",
    "when one sees that a pulsar has glitched , the fifo buffer should be saved so that a beam can then be formed towards the pulsar and thereby obtain data during the glitch .",
    "this idea of course extends beyond pulsars and could be used for detecting any transient source where there is a trigger available by other means ."
