    "strange and multi - strange hadron elliptic and radial flow results seem to indicate that the observed collectivity originates from a partonic phase @xcite .",

    "a cornerstone of this conclusion is the observed number - of - constituent - quark ( ncq- ) scaling of the flow of baryons vs. mesons . because this interpretation addresses key issues in high - energy nuclear collisions such as deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration , it is of utmost importance to conduct a systematic study of other possible explanations for the observed particle type dependencies .    for the present analysis we employ two independent hadron - string transport models rqmd(v2.4 ) and urqmd(v2.2 )",

    "within the framework of the hadronic transport approach , a typical heavy ion collision proceeds schematically in three stages , i.e. the pre - hadronic ( strings and constituent ( di-)quarks ) stage , the hadronic pre - equilibrium stage , the evolution towards hadronic kinetic equilibrium and freeze - out .",
    "the pre - hadronic stage involves the initial excitation and fragmentation of color strings and ropes . at the highest rhic energy , this stage lasts for about 0.5 - 1.5  fm / c and",
    "the effective transverse pressure / eos is rather soft . during the late hadronic stage ,",
    "the hadronic system approaches local kinetic equilibrium followed by an approach to free - streaming , where the system escapes equilibrium due to dilution of the hadronic gas : the mean free path of the hadrons exceeds the finite size of the system @xcite , the free streaming hadrons decay and feed down to the lightest species .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the model results on the centrality dependence of the charged hadron @xmath0-values along with measurements from the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "both hadronic transport models ( urqmd v2.2 and rqmd v2.4 ) reach about 60% of the measured @xmath0 values only , although the centrality dependencies are very similar to the data .",
    "there is a small variance between the two models , which we consider as an estimate of the systematic errors in such model calculations .",
    "although the @xmath0 values from the hadronic transport model also depend on the formation - time of hadrons from strings @xcite , the failure of both hadronic transport models to describe quantitatively the magnitude of @xmath0 is a strong indication that there are interactions amongst pre - hadronic constituents ( partons ) present in nature ( but not in the hadron - string models discussed here ) , which are responsible for the large @xmath0 values observed in the experiments @xcite .",

    "one clearly observes a strong correlation between freeze - out time and elliptic flow : particles that decouple earlier have a larger @xmath0 value than those that freeze - out later .",
    "the lower @xmath7 particles tend to freeze - out later and their @xmath0 continues to evolve late in the evolution ( a similar correlation has been observed earlier in low energy collisions @xcite ) the decrease in the @xmath0 towards later times is related to the reduction of the coordinate - space anisotropy with time - i.e. the system has become more spherical than it was at earlier times .",
    "the @xmath0 values of higher @xmath7-pions saturate sooner and tend to reflect the earlier stage of the collision more strongly .",
    "thus , within the model dynamics , the final @xmath0 is mostly driven by the early stages of the reaction ; the @xmath0 values at high @xmath7 are closer to the initial / early @xmath0 values than the @xmath0 values at lower @xmath7 .",

    "how much of the observed ncq - scaling features can be reproduced by the hadronic models ? in both dynamical approaches , finite ( vacuum ) cross sections are used to model the strong interactions in the hadron - string cascade . unlike the simplistic cooper - frye freeze - out treatment in most hydrodynamic calculations , the transition from strongly interacting matter to free - streaming is determined here by the interplay of the local particle density and the energy dependent cross section of the individual hadrons .",
    "it is well known that a proper treatment of the gradual freeze - out is crucial for the finally observed hadron distributions .",
    "it was pointed out that the hydrodynamical results on flow depend strongly on the proper kinetic treatment of the freeze - out process and can not be approximated by isotherms @xcite .",
    "however , the major shortcoming of the present hadron - string approach is the lack of the early partonic interactions which are important for the early dynamics in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . in order to take care of both partonic and hadronic interactions in high - energy nuclear collisions ,",

    "this  crossing and subsequent splitting \" between meson- and baryon elliptic flow as well as the breakdown of the hydrodynamical mass scaling at high transverse momenta was first predicted within the urqmd model @xcite and has later been observed in the experimental data .",
    "it is important to note that the more recent explanations of this effect ( the suggested  number - of - constituent - quark \" scaling ) is not a unique feature of the  quark recombination / coalescence \" assumption : hadronic interactions alone have quantitatively ( at the correct @xmath7-values ) predicted this hadron type dependence .    , @xmath2 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 @xmath0 from au+au collisions at @xmath6  gev .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the calculated unscaled and scaled @xmath0 values of various hadrons versus the unscaled and scaled transverse momenta , @xmath7 , of the various hadrons . on the left hand side ( figure [ fig4](a ) )",
    "one can see that at lower transverse momenta , @xmath7 @xmath20 1.5 gev / c , the heavier hadrons exhibit smaller @xmath0 values than the lighter hadrons : hadron transport theory predicts mass ordering .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath0 values from the urqmd calculations are also included .",
    "they are the lowest of all @xmath0 values for @xmath21 gev / c .",
    "such mass ordering is exactly what is observed in the experimental data @xcite and is in accord with hydrodynamic calculations @xcite .",
    "hence , hadronic interactions , which do take place at later stages of the collisions , also do contribute to the observed collective motion .    at higher @xmath7 values , this mass dependence gives way to the @xmath22-dependence on the hadron type ( i.e. meson or baryon ) .",
    "here , it is interesting to note that the @xmath5-baryons seemingly acquire a significant amount of @xmath0 in the model calculations .",
    "in addition , there is also clear , but small difference for kaons and pions in @xmath0 values at @xmath23  gev / c .",
    "this particle type dependence , rather than the otherwise dominating particle mass dependence , is also observed in the data @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath24 meson has a mass that is very close to the mass of the baryons @xmath10 and @xmath3 , and , indeed , recent experimental results on the @xmath24 s @xmath0 values are similar to other mesons @xcite . however , in the hadronic transport model , about 2/3 of the @xmath24-mesons are formed via @xmath2-@xmath25-coalescence , which is not necessarily the dominant process in heavy ion collisions @xcite . therefore , the @xmath0 values of @xmath24 meson are not shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "it should also be noted that in the high @xmath7 region , @xmath26  gev / c , all @xmath0 values start to decrease .",
    "this indicates that the system is deviating from an ideal hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "this trend is best seen in the right ,  scaled \" , plot in fig .",
    "such a drop has been observed in the data .     from minimum bias",

    "symbols represent results from the urqmd ( v2.2 ) model for various hadron species . at low @xmath28 gev / c",
    ", @xmath1 does not follow the scaling perhaps caused by the resonance decay @xcite . in higher @xmath7 region",
    ", @xmath2 meson seems to fall off the scaling curve due to the comparatively small hadronic cross sections in the model.,height=302 ]    the test of the ncq scaling hypothesis is shown in figure [ fig4](b ) , which depicts the scaled hadron values , @xmath29 .",
    "the scaling factor is the number of constituent quarks ( ncq ) in accord with the coalescence approach @xcite . for mesons and baryons , @xmath30 and @xmath27=3 , respectively .",
    "the ncq - scaling is clearly observed in both rqmd ( not shown here ) and urqmd model calculations except for the pions .",
    "this surprising result and its implications for the frequently invoked recombination / coalescence hypothesis will be discussed in the last section .",
    "however , one should note that there are experimentally distinguishable differences ( when differential @xmath5 elliptic flow data with good statistics becomes available ) between `` real '' ncq scaling from coalescence and the approximate ncq scaling due to the cross section hierarchy discussed here . in the coalescence approach one expects identical elliptic flow of all baryons irrespective of their type .",
    "in contrast , the present aqm scaling picture , leads to an observable ordering of the elliptic flow at fixed @xmath7 according to the strangeness content .",
    "this can indeed be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where an ordering of the elliptic flow values can be observed : @xmath31 .",
    "the particle and energy density is highest at the center of the created fireball in relativistic nuclear collisions - initially , there is an angular dependent matter density gradient .",
    "the repulsive interactions among the constituents will therefore push matter to move outwards . in this way",
    ", the collective flow develops in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that flow means matter- and energy flow .",
    "it is independent of the type of particles , either partons or hadrons , or different kinds of hadrons .",
    "hence , by studying the collective motion of the produced hadrons one can , in principle , extract the information of early collision dynamics @xcite . in general",
    ", one expects that the final elliptic flow , @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the hyper - surface where hadrons are emitted , will depend on @xmath34 , i.e. the interaction cross section , which , in principle , depends on the particle type , cm angle and relative momenta .",
    "the specific particle density depends on the collision time @xmath35 , location , and momentum . for short mean free paths ,",
    "the transverse flow is intimately related to the pressure , which in turn depends on the density and temperature of the matter under study @xcite .",
    "indeed , the frequent rescatterings among the hadrons can lead to hydrodynamic - like mass ordering in the low @xmath7 region .    at the higher transverse momenta , @xmath36  gev / c , the particles escape quickly from the system to low density , in effect leading to early freeze - out and lack of development of the hydrodynamics and the details of the interaction cross - sections are most important . as the cross sections depend on the particle type , for mesons or baryons to first approximation given by the constituent quark model @xcite",
    ", we do expect roughly a 2:3 scaling of the meson - to - baryon elliptic flow from transport calculations .",
    "the hadronic models underpredicted the strength of @xmath0 at rhic , because early partonic interactions ( except from quark coalescence during the string break - up ) are not included in the model .",
    "the early stage with highest density and smallest mean free paths is  missing \" .",
    "this shortcoming of the hadronic models clearly demonstrates the need for the early , dense partonic interactions in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "in summary , the hadronic transport models urqmd and rqmd have been employed to study the elliptic flow of hadrons in au+au collisions at the highest rhic energy .",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath0 values as a function of collision centrality , transverse momenta and collision time for various meson- and baryon species , including multi - strange baryons .",
    "both hadron - string transport models fail by 40% to exhaust the absolute value of @xmath0 , probably due to the lack of ( partonic ) interactions in the initial , hot and dense stage .",
    "however , because of the hadronic re - interactions , the hadron mass hierarchy is qualitatively well reproduced in the low @xmath7 region .",
    "rescattering is the key that leads to the quasi - ideal hydrodynamic appearance in @xmath22 .",
    "also in the intermediate @xmath7 region , the hadron type dependence ( number - of - constituent - quark scaling ) is predicted by both hadronic transport models . here , this dependence is due to the hadronic cross sections which do roughly scale with the number of constituent quarks , in accord with the additive quark model .",
    "this finding challenges the recent interpretation of ncq scaling as a unique deconfinement signature .",
    "thus , further tests of the deconfinement - plus - recombination hypothesis are necessary with high precision @xmath0 measurements of resonance hadrons like @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
