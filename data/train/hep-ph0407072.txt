    "the standard model ( sm ) of high energy physics has been rigorously tested by experiments , especially during the last decade of beautiful experiments at cern , fermilab and slac @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that no clear indication of new physics has emerged from the data .",
    "furthermore , the unknown higgs boson mass in the sm is predicted to be @xmath1 gev and @xmath2 gev at 95% c.l . by global fits of the data @xcite .    despite the unprecedented success of the sm , we believe that the sm is an incomplete theory and new physics beyond the sm will eventually emerge at some scale higher than that of electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "the possible new physics will contribute quadratically to the mass of the fundamental higgs boson due to its scalar nature .",
    "this phenomenon is the notorious fine - tuning or naturalness problem . in order to deal with this issue ,",
    "several solutions have been proposed since 1970 s of the last century : ( 1 ) new symmetries are introduced to protect the mass from quadratical radiative corrections .",
    "the popular choices are the fermion - boson symmetry ( supersymmetry ) @xcite or the global symmetry in little higgs models @xcite .",
    "we stress that in these two approaches the higgs boson is naturally light .",
    "( 2 ) extra dimensions with low - scale gravity @xcite have lowered the scale of new physics .",
    "( 3 ) the higgs boson is the composite particle of new fermions which are strongly interacting at the tev scale . it should be emphasized that although the new strong dynamics ( technicolor , topcolor etc . )",
    "@xcite solves the fine - tuning problem and is also consistent with the data , it is difficult to obtain the preferred light higgs boson mass without fine - tuning . if a light higgs boson is observed from experiments , solution ( 3 ) will be disfavored .",
    "( 4 ) the higgs boson may be indeed finely tuned @xcite and naturalness is no longer the guiding principle .",
    "this can be accomplished in the newly proposed supersymmetrical model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the impact from this novel idea on collider phenomenology .",
    "the idea of the finely tuned higgs boson was recently proposed by n. arkani - hamed and s. dimopoulos @xcite who were motivated by the fine - tuning issue of the cosmological constant , which has been set on solid ground as a consequence of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite .",
    "the finely tuned supersymmetric model was also dubbed  split supersymmetry \" ( ss ) in ref .",
    "in such an approach the naturalness principle was replaced by one of gauge coupling unification and dark matter density . in the ss",
    "all the scalars except one finely tuned higgs boson are ultra heavy while the neutralino and chargino might remain light in order to achieve gauge coupling unification and accord with the dark matter density .",
    "it should be emphasized that ss can remove most of the unpleasant diseases of tev supersymmetry , e.g. excessive flavor and cp violation , fast dimension-5 proton decay etc . @xcite .",
    "since ss emerged it has already stimulated several investigations @xcite , which were mainly focused on cosmological aspects and gauge coupling unification .",
    "although cosmological studies can provide solid evidence for new physics , it says relatively little about the properties of new particles .",
    "therefore studies about the ss impact on collider phenomenology are necessary . in this paper",
    "we investigate the chargino pair production at next generation linear colliders , especially whether we can distinguish ss from tev supersymmetry with this process . in order to discriminate ss from the usual tev supersymmetry",
    ", we need to know the mass of scalars which is one of the most important characteristics of ss .",
    "it is clear that the ultra heavy scalars in ss can hardly be directly produced at either hadron or linear colliders .",
    "therefore we should examine the virtual effects of scalars in neutralino and chargino production .",
    "we stress that the measurement of neutrino and chargino production at the lhc could provide important hints for ss : one of the most important production mechanism for neutralino and charginos at the lhc , i.e. as decay products of scalar quarks , is no longer allowed",
    ". however precise studies of chargino and neutralino production with relatively rare events in ss seem challenging due to the large qcd backgrounds at hadron colliders .",
    "in contrast linear colliders are more promising , especially chargino production which can potentially be used to reconstruct the chargino properties @xcite as well as to determine the sneutrino mass .",
    "due to r - parity conservation , supersymmetrical particles can only be produced in pairs . in fig .",
    "[ feyn ] we show the feynman diagrams for chargino pair production at linear colliders .",
    "this process occurs at tree level via s - channel photon and z , as well as t - channel sneutrino exchanges .",

    "in the following , we study numerically the ss effects on the observables of chargino pair production at linear colliders .",
    "the ss parameter space will be analyzed first .",
    "based on the gaugino mass unification assumption and the dark matter density constraint @xmath23 , the allowed parameter space of ss can be classified into three categories @xcite    1 .",
    "mixed region : @xmath11 and @xmath12 are comparable and below 1 - 2 tev . in this region the lightest neutralino and chargino are always in a the mixed state of the higgsino and gaugino , and the mass of the chargino and neutralino can be as low as the present experimental limit .",
    "we stress that in this case the long - lived gluino might be found at the lhc and gluino lifetime can be used to probe scale of the ultra heavy scalar .",
    "@xmath24 tev and the gaugino masses are arbitrarily larger than @xmath12 .",
    "the neutralino and chargino are considerably heavier .",
    "3 .   @xmath25 and the other parameters are arbitrarily larger .",
    "it is clear that the case ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are not happy for colliders , so we will investigate the collider signature for case ( 1 ) only .",
    "we stress that the discovery reach of the lhc and next linear colliders can not cover the entire ss parameter space .    in the mixed region",
    ", the magnitude of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be as low as @xmath26 gev .",
    "we take two typical points labelled as  *",

    "[ pb ] the characteristics for * pa * are the light chargino and @xmath27 while for * pb * chargino is heavy and @xmath28 . it should be noted that the sign of @xmath12 does not affect chargino production .    in fig .",
    "[ siga ] we show the cross sections as a function of sneutrino mass for * pa * with @xmath29 gev .",
    "it is obvious that the three modes ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 22 ) can all act as probes of the sneutrino mass .",
    "this feature is typical in the mixed region for low @xmath11 .",
    "moreover one can distinguish the 1 tev and 10 tev sneutrino through the cross section measurements .",
    "for example , the cross sections for the ( 11 ) mode are 0.18 pb and 0.25 pb for a 1 tev and 10 tev sneutrino respectively , and for the ( 22 ) mode they are 0.19 pb and 0.23 pb respectively .",
    "we can also see that the cross sections for the ( 11 ) and ( 22 ) modes increase while for the ( 12 ) mode it decreases with sneutrino mass .",
    "this is because as the sneutrino mass increases , the contributions arising from t - channel sneutrino decrease , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the strong destructive effects for a light sneutrino in the ( 11 ) and ( 22 ) modes are weaker than for a heavy sneutrino .    in fig .",
    "[ afba ] and [ alra ] the differential cross sections , @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath31 are given for * pa * respectively . from diagrams ( a)-(c ) of both figures",
    "we can see that as the sneutrino mass increases , the differential cross sections and left - right asymmetry tend generally to be more symmetric , and again the three modes can all act as probes of the sneutrino mass . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) modes are more sensitive to the sneutrino mass than that of the ( 22 ) , while for @xmath31 the ( 12 ) mode is more sensitive .    in fig .",
    "[ sigb ] and [ b ] we show the cross sections , @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of sneutrino mass for * pb * with @xmath32 tev . for the cross section and @xmath30 , the ( 12 ) and ( 22 ) modes are sensitive to the sneutrino mass while the ( 11 ) mode is not .",
    "moreover the ( 22 ) mode is more promising than that of the ( 12 ) because of its relatively large cross section . for @xmath31 ,",
    "only the ( 12 ) mode is sensitive to the sneutrino mass .",
    "it is obvious that for all observables the ( 11 ) mode is not sensitive to the sneutrino mass because , from eq .",
    "[ qlr ] , @xmath33 makes sneutrino almost decouple from the ( 11 ) mode .",
    "we have investigated the impact of split supersymmetry on chargino pair production at the next linear colliders . from the numerical discussions for two typical parameter sets * pa * and * pb * which are inferred from gauge coupling unification and constrained by the dark matter density , we can see that chargino pair production is sensitive to the sneutrino mass up to 10 tev . for low @xmath11 all three modes ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 22 ) are sensitive to the sneutrino mass , while for high @xmath11 the ( 22 ) mode is most promising .",
    "we stress that the analysis of all three modes ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 22 ) is necessary in order to distinguish ss from tev supersymmetry .    in this study , we have only included tree - level contributions and are aware that higher order corrections @xcite are likely to be non - negligible , especially for precise determination on scalar mass scale .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that our approach is satisfactory for a preliminary study to gauge the potential of this process for distinguishing ss from tev supersymmetry .",
    "it is known that beam polarization will be a very useful tool at the linear colliders to enhance signal , reduce background as well as extract couplings etc . @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are more concerned about physical observable s dependence on the sneutrino contributions which are only explicitly present in @xmath5 in eq .",
    "it is obvious that the beam polarization will enhance such kind of dependence , especially for double beams polarization .",
    "if ss stands up to the scrutiny of lhc ( no light scalars , except one higgs boson , are found ) , tev supersymmetry will be at least highly disfavored . in order to test ss",
    ", it is necessary to exam the susy couplings relations at linear colliders , for example @xmath34 in mixed region @xcite .",
    "it is very promising that precise test on such kinds of susy relations can be achieved @xcite .",
    "we stress that the more solid conclusions can be drawn only after the real simulations .",
