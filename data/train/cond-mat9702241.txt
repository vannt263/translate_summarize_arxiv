    "the interplay of disorder and many - body interactions in electronic systems has been studied intensively within the last two decades.@xcite for non - interacting electrons , the highly successful `` scaling hypothesis of localization '' was put forward in 1979 by abrahams _",
    "et al._,@xcite but the role played by many - particle interactions is much less understood and still no entirely consistent picture exists.@xcite the recent discovery of a metal - insulator transition in certain two - dimensional electron gases at zero magnetic field @xcite has renewed the interest in this problem , since in the samples considered the electron interaction is estimated to be much larger than the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite thus the observed transition may be due to an interaction - driven enhancement of the conductivity .    the simplest version of the interacting disordered particle problem is perhaps the case of just two interacting particles ( tip ) in a random potential in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "for a hubbard on - site interaction this problem has recently also attracted a lot of attention after shepelyansky @xcite argued that attractive as well as repulsive interactions between the two particles ( bosons or fermions ) lead to the formation of particle pairs whose localization length @xmath0 is much larger than the single - particle ( sp ) localization length @xmath1.@xcite based on a mapping of the tip hamiltonian onto an effective random matrix model ( rmm ) he predicted @xmath2 at two - particle energy @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the nearest - neighbor transfer matrix element and @xmath5 the hubbard interaction strength . shortly afterwards , imry @xcite used a thouless - type block - scaling picture ( bsp ) in support of this . the most surprising aspect of eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) is the fact that in the limit of weak disorder the ratio @xmath6 diverges .",
    "thus , in the limit of weak disorder the particle pair can travel infinitely further than a sp .",
    "this should be contrasted with renormalization group studies of the 1d hubbard model at finite particle density which indicate that a repulsive onsite interaction leads to a strongly localized ground state.@xcite    subsequent analytical investigations further explored the mapped tip problem as an rmm problem.@xcite direct numerical approaches to the tip problem have been based on the time evolution of wave packets , @xcite transfer matrix methods ( tmm),@xcite green function approaches,@xcite or exact diagonalization @xcite . in these investigations usually",
    "an enhancement of @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 has been found but the quantitative results differ both from the analytical prediction in eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) , and from each other .",
    "furthermore , a check of the functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is numerically very expensive since it requires very large system sizes . following the approach of ref .",
    ", two of us studied the tip problem by a different tmm @xcite and found that ( i ) the enhancement @xmath6 decreases with increasing system size @xmath7 , ( ii ) the behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath8 is equal to @xmath1 in the limit @xmath9 only , and ( iii ) the enhancement @xmath6 also vanishes completely in this limit .",
    "therefore it was concluded @xcite that the tmm applied to the tip problem in 1d measures an enhancement of the localization length which is entirely due to the finiteness of the systems considered .    in this paper",
    "we return the attention to the original mapping @xcite of the tip problem onto an effective rmm .",
    "we argue that the mapping as in ref .",
    "is potentially dangerous since ( a ) it overestimates the typical coupling matrix element and ( b ) it neglects phase correlations which we believe to be essential , because it is known that interference effects are responsible for anderson localization to begin with . in order to establish that the mapping procedure @xcite can lead to incorrect results we first numerically investigate the interaction - induced coupling matrix elements between the non - interacting basis states for various values of the sp localization length .",
    "we find that the typical coupling matrix element decreases significantly faster with increasing sp localization length than assumed in ref .  .",
    "this alone would lead to a significantly smaller increase , if any , of the tip localization length than in eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) .",
    "we further show that even if the rmm correctly described the dependency of the coupling matrix element on the sp localization length , its results for the tip localization length can not be trusted . to this end",
    "we present two simple physical examples , namely anderson models with additional perturbing random potentials for which the rmm mapping yields the same enhancement of the localization length as for the tip problem .",
    "however , for our examples this enhancement is obviously incorrect . we also show that analogous problems exist for the bsp.@xcite we argue that the failure of the rmm approach in our toy models is caused by neglecting the correlations between the coupling matrix elements .",
    "this has already been made responsible @xcite for quantitative differences between eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) and numerical results for the tip problem .",
    "we show , however , that neglecting the correlations not only changes the quantitative predictions of the theory but can lead to qualitatively incorrect results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - rmm ]",
    "we briefly summarize the rmm approach to the tip problem . in section [ sec - num ]",
    "we present our numerical results for the tip coupling matrix elements and their dependence on the sp localization length .",
    "the failure of the rmm approach to correctly predict the localization length of two toy models is discussed in section [ sec - toy ] while section [ sec - bsptoy ] shows the failure of the bsp for these toy models .",
    "we discuss the relevance of our results for the original tip problem and conclude in section [ sec - con ] .",
    "let us start by recalling the basic steps of the rmm approach @xcite to tip in a random potential .",
    "the relevant energy scales are chosen such that the sp band width @xmath10 is larger than the ( uniform ) spread of the disorder @xmath11 which in turn is supposed to be larger than the interaction strength @xmath5 .",
    "the basic idea is to represent the tip hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of the non - interacting problem and then to replace the full hamiltonian by a suitably chosen random matrix .",
    "the ( non - interacting ) sp eigenstates are approximately described by @xmath12 ,    \\label{eq - psi1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the localization center of the @xmath14th eigenstate and @xmath15 is a phase which appears to be random but contains all the information about interferences necessary for anderson localization . in the absence of interactions and neglecting symmetry considerations the two - particle eigenstates are just products of two sp eigenstates , @xmath16 ,   \\label{eq - psi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the coordinates of the first and second particle , respectively .",
    "switching on the hubbard interaction @xmath19 between the two particles induces transitions between the eigenstates @xmath20 of the non - interacting problem . to estimate the transition rates",
    "it is first noted that the matrix element @xmath21 is exponentially small for @xmath22 or @xmath23 or @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the interaction couples each of the two - particle states ( [ eq - psi2 ] ) close to the diagonal in the 2d configuration space ( @xmath26 ) to @xmath27 other such states .",
    "the interaction matrix element is then the sum of @xmath1 contributions each with magnitude @xmath28 and approximately random phases . neglecting possible correlations among these contributions , shepelyansky found the magnitude @xmath29 of the matrix element @xmath30 independent of the interaction being attractive , repulsive or even random .",
    "( [ eq - matrix ] ) is one of the essential ingredients of the rmm . in section [ sec - num ]",
    "we will present numerical data in order to check its validity .",
    "we remark that the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq - matrix ] ) has recently been questioned in ref .   where the authors have computed a different estimate taking into account the nearly bloch - like structure of the eigenstates for small @xmath11 .",
    "shepelyansky @xcite now replaced the full tip hamiltonian by an effective rmm for those of the two - particle states that are coupled by the interaction .",
    "thus the hamiltonian matrix becomes a banded matrix whose elements are independent gaussian random numbers with zero mean .",
    "the diagonal elements are drawn from a distribution of width @xmath4 , because for small disorder @xmath11 the nearest - neighbor transfer @xmath4 determines the band width of the sp states .",
    "the distribution of the off - diagonal elements has width @xmath31 within a band of width @xmath1 .    in order to obtain results for the localization properties of such an rmm",
    "one has to distinguish different regimes , depending on the strength of the interaction . if the interaction is strong enough to couple many non - interacting eigenstates , _",
    "i.e. _ , the inverse lifetime @xmath32 of a non - interacting state is large compared to the level spacing of the coupled states , fermi s golden rule can be applied .",
    "this regime was investigated in ref .   and also gives the largest enhancement of @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 .",
    "we note that in this regime the level - spacing distribution of the non - interacting system can not play a significant role since the interactions couple a large number of levels and lead to a decay into a quasi - continuum of final states . in the opposite limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the interaction couples only few non - interacting eigenstates , fermi s golden rule can not be applied .",
    "instead , one finds rabi oscillations between the few coupled states.@xcite we note that in this regime the level spacing distribution of the non - interacting states becomes important . in the following",
    "we will only consider the golden rule regime .",
    "the localization length of the effective rmm can be determined by several equivalent methods .",
    "here we follow shepelyansky:@xcite calculating the decay rate @xmath32 of a non - interacting eigenstate by means of fermi s golden rule gives @xmath33 . since the typical hopping distance is of the order of @xmath1 the diffusion constant is @xmath34 . within a time",
    "@xmath35 the particle pair visits @xmath36 states .",
    "diffusion stops when the level spacing of the visited states is of the order of the frequency resolution @xmath37 .",
    "this determines the cut - off time @xmath38 and the corresponding pair - localization length is obtained as @xmath39 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) .",
    "applicability of fermi s golden rule requires @xmath40 which is equivalent to @xmath41 .",
    "this is exactly the condition for an enhancement of @xmath0 compared to @xmath1 .",
    "let us recapitulate : the mapping of the tip problem onto the rmm described above relies on two assumptions : ( a ) the non - interacting wavefunctions can be described by a decaying amplitude with finite localization length and a random phase which leads to the @xmath42 behavior in eq .",
    "( [ eq - matrix ] ) and ( b ) any correlations between the matrix elements in the hamiltonian can be neglected . in the next two sections we will closer analyze the validity of these two assumptions .",
    "in this section we present results for the interaction - induced coupling matrix elements in order to check whether they follow the @xmath43 power law ( [ eq - matrix ] ) as assumed in ref .   .",
    "since @xmath1 deviates from the simple power - law prediction @xcite @xmath44 at @xmath3 already for @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , we have first computed @xmath1 by tmm @xcite in 1d with @xmath47 accuracy for all @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we next exactly diagonalize the sp hamiltonian and obtain the eigenstates .",
    "we then compute the `` center - of - mass '' ( cm ) of these eigenstates as @xmath50 .",
    "for hard wall boundary conditions , we have checked that using this definition of the cm we can reproduce the disorder dependence of @xmath1 from the decay of the sp wave function @xmath51 via @xmath52 to within @xmath53 up to @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath56 samples of length @xmath57 . for periodic boundary conditions",
    ", we use a suitably generalized definition for the cm .",
    "we next calculate the matrix elements @xmath21 for all states with appropriate cm , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . since the interaction strength @xmath5 appears only as a multiplicative prefactor in the matrix elements , we choose @xmath62 in all of what follows .",
    "we emphasize that the bottleneck in such a computation is not the system size @xmath7 , but rather the exponentially growing number of overlapping matrix elements for increasing @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipme - bin ] we show the unnormalized probability distributions @xmath63 of diagonal and off - diagonal coupling matrix elements .",
    "@xmath63 was computed at disorder @xmath64 where the enhancement of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 is expected to be large.@xcite we have averaged over @xmath56 different disorder configurations for @xmath65 . for a more detailed inspection we plot the data on a doubly logarithmic scale in figs .",
    "[ fig - tipme - bin - dd ] and [ fig - tipme - bin - od ] .",
    "as already discussed before @xcite we note that ( i ) the diagonal elements are non - negative , ( ii ) @xmath66 is symmetric around @xmath67 . the deviation from symmetry for @xmath68 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath69 , is most likely due to the finite size of the samples .",
    "more importantly , ( iii ) @xmath66 is strongly non - gaussian .",
    "we remark that a fit to a lorentzian distribution does also not describe the data .",
    "( iv ) apart from a peak at @xmath70 , @xmath71 is approximately gaussian , ( v ) @xmath66 and @xmath71 have rather long tails , ( vi ) the total distribution of matrix elements @xmath72 is dominated by @xmath66 ( as in any matrix ) and thus @xmath72 is strongly non - gaussian with long tails .",
    "for such a non - gaussian @xmath72 the average of the absolute matrix elements @xmath73 , with @xmath74 denoting the average over @xmath29 according to @xmath72 , is strongly influenced by rare events in the tails of the distribution .",
    "this is even more so when using the mean - square value @xmath75 .",
    "however , in the physical problem considered here these rare large couplings lead to oscillations of the system between the corresponding two tip states but not to delocalization .",

    "we have calculated both @xmath78 and @xmath76 for different values of @xmath11 and @xmath56 samples for @xmath79 and @xmath80 samples for @xmath81 . as shown in fig .",

    ", we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , for the largest @xmath1 the numerical data deviate  albeit weakly  from the above power law showing a slight downward curvature in the double - logarithmic representation .",
    "in fact , if we only consider the data points from the large chains with @xmath81 , we already find @xmath87 .",

    "( [ eq - matrix ] ) , we obtain @xmath95 if we use now use @xmath86 we find @xmath96 .",
    "however , as discussed above the true asymptotic dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath1 is likely to be even stronger than @xmath88 which in turn results in an even weaker enhancement of @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that the enhancement predicted by shepelyansky @xcite will vanish for @xmath97 in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "a value of @xmath99 will in fact correspond to even stronger localization of the tip .    in order to further explore the validity of assumption (",

    "[ fig - tipme - bin - dd ] and [ fig - tipme - bin - od ] , we find that the randomness of the interaction already leads to a significant decrease of the long - range nature of @xmath72 .",
    "_ e.g. _ , at @xmath101 , there is a reduction in @xmath102 by a factor of approximately @xmath103 for diagonal and approximately @xmath104 for off - diagonal matrix elements when compared to @xmath102 of the original tip problem .",
    "we further compute @xmath72 for states with the same cm as previously , but otherwise chosen according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - psi2 ] ) with uncorrelated random phases and exponentially decaying envelope .",
    "the disorder averaging is again over @xmath56 samples .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipme - bin ] , @xmath71 now has a maximum at finite @xmath29 . for these states",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath107 . as for the tip problem",
    ", we attribute this to the finite size of the samples considered .",
    "again , we note that when compared to @xmath66 for the tip problem , the present distribution of matrix elements decreases much faster and at @xmath101 is about one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath108 the distribution @xmath66 is also smaller than that for the model with random interaction .",
    "thus assumption ( a ) clearly oversimplifies the problem and the neglect of phase correlations leads to a wrong @xmath63 . in fig .",

    "[ fig - tipme - hw - l1 ] , we show also tip data for chain lengths @xmath112 . we note that deviations due to the small system size lead to a smaller slope for @xmath78 and thus may give rise to an apparent enhancement of @xmath113 . as can be seen in the figure , this decreasing of the slope happens for @xmath112 already at @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "a power - law fit for @xmath116 yields @xmath117 . the finite - size deviations for @xmath76 are different . a power - law fit for @xmath118 gives @xmath119 whereas for @xmath116 we find @xmath120 .",
    "thus first there is a decrease of @xmath113 followed by a finite - size increase of @xmath113 .",
    "for still larger @xmath121 the finite - size deviations of @xmath78 and @xmath76 become very large even resulting in a positive slope .",
    "this finite - size effect may be at least partially responsible for the enhancement observed in refs .   and for this value of @xmath7 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - tipme - hwpb - l1 ] , we show @xmath78 and @xmath76 for @xmath112 with hard wall and periodic boundary conditions . up to @xmath122 , the data for both boundary conditions agree quite well . for @xmath123 ,",
    "the slope for the data with periodic boundaries is slightly smaller than for the data with hard wall boundaries .",
    "lastly , around @xmath124 , the data for periodic boundaries shows a very fast decrease of @xmath29 .",
    "thus the data for periodic boundaries is influenced by the finite size of the sample already earlier than the data for hard wall boundaries .",
    "nevertheless , except for these finite size effects , our results for both boundary conditions are similar and we will restrict ourselves to the hard wall boundaries in the following .",
    "we remark that most numerical studies of the tip problem also use this type of boundaries .",
    "in this section we show that even an rmm which contains the correct dependence of the coupling matrix elements on the sp localization length may give qualitatively incorrect results . to this end we consider two toy models , viz .",
    "anderson models of localization with additional perturbing random potentials . by a procedure analogous to that of section [ sec - rmm ]",
    "we map these models onto rmms and then show that these rmms give erroneous enhancements of the localization length .",
    "the first example is set up to lead to the same rmm as the tip problem .",
    "it consists of the usual 2d anderson model of localization perturbed by an additional weak random potential of strength @xmath5 at the diagonal @xmath125 in real space .",
    "since this increases the width of the disorder distribution at the diagonal we expect the localization length to decrease .",
    "we now map onto an rmm as in refs .   .",

    "the hamiltonian of this model differs from the tip hamiltonian in two points : ( i ) the diagonal elements are independent random numbers instead of being partially correlated as in the tip problem and ( ii ) the interaction potential @xmath129 $ ] at each site of the diagonal is random instead of having a definite sign and modulus @xmath5 as in the tip problem .",
    "however , none of these points enters the mapping procedure outlined above .",
    "thus , applying exactly the same arguments as for the tip problem in section [ sec - rmm ] we find that the perturbation couples each state close to the diagonal ( @xmath130 ) to @xmath131 other such states .",

    "we first note that the disorder dependence of @xmath1 in the 2d anderson model is no longer approximated by the simple power law cited in section [ sec - num].@xcite in fact , @xmath1 is usually much larger in the 2d case for the same value of @xmath11",
    ". thus we compute estimates @xmath135 as a function of @xmath11 for quasi-1d strips of finite strip width @xmath7 with @xmath136 accuracy by tmm .",

    "thus both choices of @xmath1 show that @xmath78 and @xmath76 vary as @xmath148 within the accuracy of the calculation .",

    "asymptotically for large @xmath1 the pair conductance is likely to be enhanced even less than that .",
    "the behavior will be close to or even smaller than the marginal case @xmath174 .",
    "all this is in complete agreement with our corresponding considerations for the rmm .    for the 2d anderson model considered in the last section",
    ", the bsp can be applied analoguously .",
    "again , we consider blocks of linear size @xmath1 and compute the typical perturbation - induced matrix elements between these blocks as in section [ sec-2dam ] .",
    "we then find that according to the bsp the conductance of a 2d anderson model with additional weak perturbing potential along the diagonal is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - bsp ] ) . using @xmath175",
    "as obtained in section [ sec-2dam ] from the numerical data for @xmath78 and @xmath76 , we then have @xmath176 .",
    "thus the bsp yields the same unphysical result as the rmm approach of section [ sec-2dam ] .",
    "let us also apply the bsp to the 1d toy example .",
    "the level spacing in a 1d block of size @xmath1 is @xmath177 , and the coupling matrix element between states in neighboring blocks is @xmath178 .",
    "thus , the conductance of the perturbed system on a scale @xmath1 is obtained as @xmath179 . for large @xmath1",
    "this again contradicts the correct result , viz .  a decrease of the conductance compared to the unperturbed system .",
    "thus , the bsp applied to the two toy models introduced in section [ sec - toy ] gives the same qualitatively incorrect results for the localization properties as the rmm .",
    "this is not surprising since the only ingredients of the bsp are the intra - block level spacing @xmath180 and the inter - block coupling matrix elements @xmath29 which also enter the rmm and have been discussed in section [ sec - toy ] .",
    "to summarize , we have reinvestigated the rmm approach to the problem of tip in a random potential .",
    "we have shown that this kind of mapping an interacting disordered system onto an effective random matrix model is potentially dangerous since ( a ) it may overestimate the typical coupling matrix element and ( b ) it neglects correlations between the matrix elements .    in the first part of the paper we investigated the dependence of the matrix elements entering the rmm on the sp localization length @xmath1 .",
    "we found the dependence of the typical matrix element @xmath76 to be significantly stronger than for the averaged absolute value @xmath78 which is used in refs .   .",
    "if the rmm approach of section [ sec - rmm ] is modified by using the numerically determined relation between @xmath76 and @xmath1 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq - matrix ] ) the resulting enhancement of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 becomes much weaker .",
    "we showed that the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath78 is due to the over - simplified assumption ( a ) that the wave functions behave according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - psi1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , our data for @xmath76 show systematic deviations from power - law behavior indicating that the true asymptotic dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath1 is likely to be very close to or stronger than the marginal case @xmath181 . if the asymptotic dependence is stronger than @xmath181 the shepelyansky enhancement vanishes in the limit of large @xmath1 even within the rmm approach .    in the second part of this paper we showed that there are physical situations where mapping onto an rmm as in ref .",
    "gives qualitatively incorrect results , _",
    "e.g. _ , an increase of the localization length in physical situations where it should rather decrease .",
    "this failure occurs even if the rmm contains the correct dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath1 .",
    "this shows in contrast to assumption ( b ) that in general the correlations between the matrix elements can not be neglected since they contain information essential for the interference leading to anderson localization .",
    "note that the approach of ref .  ,",
    "while correcting assumption ( a ) , still includes a mapping onto an rmm and thus is plagued by the same problems as assumption ( b ) .",
    "analogously , in ref .",
    "the decay rate @xmath32 is calculated numerically , avoiding assumption ( a ) . however , the formula @xmath182 employed in ref .   is also based on an assumption similar to ( b ) .",
    "let us comment on the relevance of this work for the original problem of tip in a random potential .",
    "none of our results constitute , of course , a proof that the enhancement of the tip localization length @xmath0 predicted in ref",
    ".   does not exist .",
    "however , in our opinion , the toy counter examples to the rmm approach introduced in section [ sec - toy ] let the analytical arguments giving eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) appear much weaker . taking the rmm approach seriously but using the numerical results for the typical coupling matrix element presented in section [ sec - num ] we find that the dependence of the enhancement factor @xmath6 on @xmath1 is significantly weaker than in eq .",
    "( [ eq - shep ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , an enhancement of the pair localization length for tip as compared to @xmath1 may still exist , although the underlying mechanism should then be different .",
    "results supporting such an enhancement have been obtained by green function methods @xcite together with finite - size scaling arguments.@xcite the most recent data obtained in ref .",
    "finds an exponent @xmath183 for @xmath62 .",
