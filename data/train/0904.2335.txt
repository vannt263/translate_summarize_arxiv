    "astrophysical black holes can be simply depicted by two parameters : mass and angular momentum .",
    "masses of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are relatively easier to estimate since their gravitational influences spread over the large - scale space approached by newtonian mechanics .",
    "smbh masses in active galactic nuclei or galactic centers can be measured by several different methods through stellar or gas dynamics , or reverberation mapping of emission lines ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; ho 2008 ) .",
    "however , spins are more elusive to estimate because their general relativistic ( gr ) effects only appear significantly in the innermost region close to the black hole , typically within @xmath220 gravitational radii and eventually disappear outward then .",
    "spatially resolving the region around @xmath210 or a few gravitational radii is in principle plausible through radio observations for the galactic center ( shen et al .",
    "2005 ; doeleman et al .",
    "2008 ) , but it is still a limit challenge to current radio astronomy for estimation of the spins of the extragalactic smbhs .    hitherto , only a few seyfert galaxies show relativistically broadened , highly redshifted iron k@xmath3 emission lines , which are interpreted most plausibly by the collective effects of the doppler motion of the fluids from which the intrinsic narrow emission lines originate , the gravitational redshift , and the gravitational lensing around a rapidly rotating black hole ( see , e.g. , miller 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the most convincing evidence for effects of spins is found in the mcg-6 - 30 - 15 from xmm-_newton _ observations ( fabian et al . 2002 ) . on the other hand",
    ", cosmic x - ray background radiation suggests that most smbhs are fast rotating ( elvis et al . 2002 ) and the soltan s argument applied to large samples of quasars and galaxies indicates a similar conclusion ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "tev photons suffering from attenuation by pair productions are expected to explore the radiation fields in the vicinity of smbhs and thus constrain their spins ( wang et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "rapid variability of tev emission ( at a timescale of 2 days ) has been discovered by the hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) collaboration in the famous radio galaxy m87 ( aharonian et al .",
    "interestingly , the tev emission does _ not _ originate from a relativistic jet ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , in contrast to cases of blazars ( blandford & levinson 1995 ; levinson 2006 ) .",
    "a novel mechanism for tev emission around the horizon of a spinning black hole by a magnetospheric pulsar - like process was originally proposed by levinson ( 2000 ) , and had been applied to m87 ( neronov & aharonian 2007 , but see rieger & aharonian 2008 ) .",
    "in such a context , the tev photons are able to serve as a probe of spins which determine the density of the radiation fields .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the smbh in m87 should have specific angular momentum @xmath4 in order to allow the tev photons to escape from the innermost region of the radiation fields from the accretion disk .",
    "however , their calculations are based on the self - similar solutions of adafs in newtonian approximation and the gr effects on the disk structures and the propagation of photons are not included .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to extend the study of paper i by including all the gr effects . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the gr riaf model .",
    "section 3 gives the description of relativistic optics and the detailed formulae used for calculation of optical depth to tev photons .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 with exhaustive investigation of parameter dependence of the optical depth .",
    "we then apply the results to m87 in section 5 .",
    "discussions and a summary are given in section 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "mathematical preliminaries are presented in the appendix .",
    "we follow the work of manmoto ( 2000 ) to construct the fully relativistic hydrodynamical equations .",
    "gr notations are given in the appendix .",
    "cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath5 ) are used to describe accretion flows by expanding the boyer@xmath6lindquist coordinates around the equatorial plane up to @xmath7 terms .",
    "all the basic equations can be derived from the conservation laws of mass , momentum , and energy under the four- dimensional space . for a clarification",
    ", we list the necessary equations as follows .",
    "the continuity equation reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial velocity of the flows with respect to the corotating reference frame ( crf , see the appendix ) with @xmath10 as its lorentz factor ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1996 ; gammie & popham 1998 ; yuan et al .",

    "the simplification @xmath56 ( manmoto 2000 ) is used in deriving the energy equations .",
    "we take into account three processes of the radiative cooling , i.e. , the synchrotron radiation , the bremsstrahlung , and the multi - comptonization of soft photons .",
    "the general description of cooling processes and relevant formulae have been presented by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) and manmoto ( 2000 ) in a more handy way . in our calculations",
    "we completely make use of the program of the comptonization given by coppi & blandford ( 1990 ) .",
    "the outer boundary conditions of the gr riaf model are imposed at a radius @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the virial temperature defined as @xmath61 with the adiabatic index @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "electrons and ions have the same temperature at the outer boundary . as shown by manmoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the outer boundary conditions have little influence on the structures of the gr riafs .",
    "we confirmed this effect and thus fix the outer boundary conditions as equation ( 17 ) .    the choice of the eigenvalue @xmath39 should satisfy the condition that the flows pass through the sonic point smoothly .",
    "the inner edge of accretion flows is elusive since it depends on the accretion rate , and is nonaxisymmetric and time - variable ( see , e.g. , krolik & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "we use the horizon of the black hole as the inner edge for a conserved influence of the spins on the optical depth of tev photons .",
    "we show this effect of inner edge on uncertainties of spins in the following sections in details .",
    "we assume that the accretion flows are axisymmetric , so the radiation fields have the same symmetry , and only the motions on the @xmath64 plane are required in our calculations .",

    "given two constants of motion , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the spin parameter @xmath83 , the trajectory of a photon is uniquely determined .",
    "we neglect the photons with trajectories returning to the accretion disk but may encounter the tev photons along their path because of rare probability of occurrence .",

    "applying the invariant @xmath89 along the path of a photon ( rybicki & lightman 1979 , p. 146 ) , we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the frequency of the photons in the local rest frame ( lrf ) of the accretion flows , @xmath92 is the redshift factor of the photons ( see section 3.3 ) , @xmath93 is the specific intensity of the disk radiation at radius @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the distance of the black hole from the observer . then the observed emergent spectrum is @xmath96 for each ( @xmath97 ) set , the constants of motion @xmath81 and @xmath98 can be expressed as ( li et al .",
    "2005 ) @xmath99 where the viewing angle @xmath100 is the inclination between the rotation axis of the accretion disk and the direction to the observer . using the ray tracing method we can locate the emission place @xmath101 in the accretion disk for the photons which reach the observer s sky at point ( @xmath97 ) , and , therefore ,",
    "obtain the radiation intensity @xmath93 from the gr riaf model .",
    "the observed emergent spectrum is obtained by integrating @xmath93 over the observer s sky as shown in equation  ( 25 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the geometric scheme for calculations of the optical depth to tev photons which emanate from the position @xmath102 .",
    "the tev photons unavoidably interact with the soft photons from the accretion disk when they are moving out [ e.g. , at the interacting point @xmath103 , setting up strong constraints on the radiation fields of soft photons .",
    "we delineate the interactions in the lnrf ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "firstly we divide the solid angle at the interacting point in the lnrf into numerous elements @xmath104 . for each solid angle element",
    "at which the soft photons from the disk arrive , we can determine their constants of motion @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see equation ( 36 ) ) .",
    "secondly we use the ray tracing method to trace the soft photons back to the accretion disk .",
    "we hence obtain the number density of soft photons .",
    "lastly the optical depth is calculated by integrating all the soft photons from different directions along the trajectory of the tev photons .",
    "generally speaking , given the emission location of tev photons ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) and the viewing angle of an observer ( @xmath100 ) , there is a large number of trajectories to the observer at infinity because of the arbitrariness of the @xmath109-component .",
    "since tev photons along the shortest path intuitively suffer the least interactions and thus undergo the minimum optical depth , we only consider the optical depth for the shortest path in our calculations .",
    "we select the trajectory with @xmath110 as the shortest path , which represents the case that the tev photons lie at the projection of the rotation axis on the image sky . keep in mind that genuine emission position always has nonzero @xmath109-component , i.e. , @xmath111 , due to the drag of inertia caused by the rotation of black hole .    in the lnrf , given the frequency of tev photons @xmath112 at infinity , we can determine their corresponding frequency at the interacting point @xmath113 by redshift factor defined as @xmath114 where the subscript @xmath115 or @xmath116 means their values are calculated at position ( @xmath117 ) or infinity and similarly hereinafter .",
    "in the same way , at the interacting point the frequency of soft photons is given by the redshift factor in comparison with their frequency at the emanating place @xmath118 in the accretion disk , @xmath119             \\right|_{r_{\\rm d}}}.\\ ] ] the directional angles of the tev and the soft photons can be obtained from the projection of their four - momentum onto the spatial directions of the lnrf , respectively . the direction cosines ( @xmath120 ) of the tev photons in the lnrf are given by @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 and those of the soft photons are given by replacing the superscript ( subscript ) `` tev '' with `` s '' in the above equations : @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 note that @xmath127 , just giving @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we can obtain @xmath105 and @xmath106 from equations  ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we define two denotations @xmath130 then we can express @xmath105 and @xmath106 by @xmath128 and @xmath129 as @xmath131 having obtained @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the ray tracing method is used to determine the emission location @xmath118 of the soft photons in the accretion disk .    the number density of the soft photons at the interacting point @xmath132 is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the planck s constant .",
    "here we have applied the invariant @xmath89 along the path of a photon .",
    "finally , the expression for the optical depth of the disk radiation fields to the tev photons is written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the proper length differential with @xmath137 defined to be differential of the affine parameter @xmath138 along the tev photons trajectory ( see equation  ( 22 ) ) , @xmath139 is the solid angle element in the lnrf , and @xmath140 is the cosine of angle between the tev photons and the soft photons .",
    "the cross - section of the two colliding photons with energy @xmath141 and @xmath142 is given by gould & schrder ( 1967 ) @xmath143,\\ ] ] for pair productions , where @xmath144 is the thompson cross - section and @xmath145 is the velocity of electrons and positrons at the center of momentum frame in units of @xmath146 related to @xmath147 and @xmath148 through @xmath149 the cross section depends on the energies of the interacting photons and their colliding angle .",
    "if the two colliding photons run in parallel ( @xmath150 ) , their interaction disappears .",
    "the 10tev photons mostly interact with soft photons of @xmath151ev for header - to - header collisions ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "as shown below , in specific calculations , the energy of soft colliding photons will be modified due to energy shift and bending of their trajectories caused by the gr effects .",
    "it should be pointed out that the gr effects on @xmath153 occur through three factors : ( 1 ) changing the global structures of riafs , as a result , causing dependence of the radiation fields on the spin parameter ; ( 2 ) modifying the observed spectrum from the riafs ; and ( 3 ) bending the trajectories of tev photons . for different spins of black holes ,",
    "the global structures of riafs become significantly different starting @xmath2100 @xmath154 inward . once considering the second influence , the observed spectrum is dependent on the viewing angles .",
    "the third influence is nonnegligible unless the trajectories of tev photons closely approach the black hole ( @xmath210 @xmath154 ) .",
    "these three factors jointly influence the final optical depth to tev photons .",
    "first , we numerically solve the gr riaf equations for its structure spanning a large space of parameters .",
    "the results are consistent with the numerical solutions in manmoto ( 2000 ) .",
    "second , we calculate the intrinsic spectrum for each case of riafs with different accretion rates and spins .",
    "third , the ray tracing method is employed to get the spectrum in an observer s frame .",
    "last , the optical depth to 10tev photons is calculated along their path from @xmath155 to the observer s sky at @xmath156 .",
    "the constants of motion @xmath157 and @xmath158 are obtained according to equation  ( 26 ) , where the impact @xmath3 is set zero corresponding to the shortest path and @xmath88 is determined by solving the geodesic equations .",
    "the properties of structures and emergent spectrum of riafs can be found in manmoto ( 2000 ) .",
    "here we focus on the optical depth of tev photons .",
    "hereinafter we scale accretion rate in the units of the eddington rate @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "we set @xmath162 throughout the paper , and @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 in this section .",
    "the black hole spins enhance the gr effects on the riaf structures , the emergent spectrum , and the photon trajectories .",
    "detailed calculations show that both the surface density and the temperature of accretion flows at fixed radius increase with the spins , consequently , making the radiation more efficient with the spins . in light of the drag of the frame , the trajectories of tev photons will be elongated and the probabilities of pair productions are thus enhanced .",
    "these two factors together increase @xmath153 with the spins .",
    "however , the gr influence on the photon trajectories appears within a radius @xmath210 @xmath166 and , therefore , is less important at relatively large radius .",
    "figure  3 shows the dependence of @xmath153 on the black hole spins for given parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 at four emission radii of tev photons .",
    "obviously , @xmath153 increases with the spins , and its dependence on the spins is more tight at smaller radius because the gr effects become more significant .",
    "we can find that @xmath169 for @xmath170 at @xmath171 .",
    "on the other hand , the tev photons from @xmath172 can not escape from the radiation fields of the gr riafs for all spin ranges since @xmath173 .      in figure 4",
    "we show @xmath153 as a strong function of @xmath107 , the radius of the location of tev photons , by fixing @xmath175 and @xmath168 .",
    "the radiation fields from riafs become more and more intensive when @xmath107 approaches the black hole , leading to a deep dependence of @xmath153 on @xmath107 .",
    "it is difficult to get an analytical formulation of the dependence , but figure 4 shows the details of the dependence numerically .",
    "the radiation fields from the riafs have different spatial distributions with the spins since the gr effects cause their structures distinct .",
    "as explained in section 4.1 , the spins enhance the radiation fields .",
    "if we fix the energy budget released from the riafs , the radiation fields should be more compact for the larger spins , causing a steeper @xmath153@xmath6@xmath107 relation .",
    "the @xmath174 dependence of @xmath153 can be applied to estimate the spins .",
    "the dependence of @xmath153 on @xmath100 and @xmath108 is caused by the anisotropy of radiation fields from the disk and the dependence of the cross - section on the colliding angle in particular .",
    "generally speaking , the number density of soft photons is mostly contributed from the inner region of the accretion disk . at larger @xmath107",
    ", the path of these photons that reach the interacting point with the tev photons approximately has the same polar angle with @xmath108 .",
    "since when the two colliding photons run in parallel , their interaction disappears .",
    "we can see @xmath153 reaches its minimum at @xmath176 , whereas at smaller @xmath107 , the tev photons are embedded in the radiation fields from the inner region of the accretion disk and interact with soft photons from all directions and , consequently , it is difficult to give a general explanation to the dependence on @xmath100 and @xmath108 .",
    "we present the @xmath153-dependence on @xmath100 and @xmath108 in figures 5 and 6 , respectively , for the fixed parameters @xmath177 and @xmath178 at different @xmath107 . from figure 5",
    "we find that ( 1 ) for @xmath179 , @xmath153 monotonously increases with @xmath100 , and ( 2 ) there is a minimum @xmath153 for relatively large @xmath174 at @xmath176 .",
    "this is confirmed by the case of @xmath180 .",
    "figure  6 shows that the @xmath153-dependence on @xmath108 has the similar properties as that on @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath153-dependence on accretion rates is more straightforward in light of the changes of number density of soft photons and sed from the riafs .",
    "figure  7 illustrates how @xmath153 changes with accretion rates for fixed parameters @xmath178 and @xmath168 .",
    "we find that @xmath153 is extremely sensitive to accretion rates as @xmath182 , and the power index tends to be flat at larger @xmath107 .",
    "this strongly indicates that tev photons can be violently diluted by minor changes in accretion rates . in this sense",
    ", intensive @xmath183-ray emission can not be detected in variable sources .",
    "this has important implication in observations .",
    "this strong dependence can be explained in the following ways .",
    "firstly , riafs have properties @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the magnetic field , @xmath186 is peak frequency of synchrotron emission , @xmath187 is the lorentz factor of hot thermal electrons , and @xmath188 is the optical depth for thompson scattering .",
    "the synchrotron emission power approximates as @xmath189 and the bremsstrahlung emission power @xmath190 . in our calculations , we find that @xmath191 and hence @xmath192 , where @xmath193 .",
    "to understand the @xmath153-dependence on @xmath194 , we have to know the energy of soft photons interacting with tev photons .",
    "figure  8 shows the contribution to @xmath153 for soft photons with different frequencies from an riaf model with @xmath195 , @xmath178 , @xmath168 , and @xmath196 .",
    "we find that @xmath197hz , which corresponds to the first comptonization peak or the second determined by the parameters of the riafs . since riafs are optically thin , most of the synchrotron photons escape and a small fraction ( @xmath198 ) are compton - scattered by the hot electrons , the energy densities @xmath199 and @xmath200 for the first and second comptonization , respectively .",
    "this determines the sensitivities of @xmath153-dependence on @xmath194 as @xmath201 for larger @xmath181 , the bremsstrahlung emission will dominate the synchrotron emission and the comptonization , even at the lower frequency .",
    "this leads to a flatter power index @xmath202 .",
    "these are nicely consistent with the numerical results as shown in figure 7 .",
    "we would like to point out that the very sensitive dependences of @xmath203 on accretion rate as @xmath204 evidently indicate @xmath205 for the standard accretion disk , immediately drawing a conclusion that the tev photons can not escape from the vicinity of smbh fueled by the standard accretion disk .",
    "this is confirmed by the work of zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) .",

    "\\(1 ) _ the size of the tev source_. we simply assume a point - like tev emission source and neglect its size .",
    "once considering spatial distribution of the source , @xmath153 should depend on the location of tev photons since they have different trajectories .",
    "we here only focus on the minimum optical depth ; however , the results in the present paper are viable for the current instruments of tev detection",
    ". future work on the size effects could produce interesting results on variabilities of tev photons , including the profile of light curves and the time lag between the different tev photons .",
    "this may provide a mapping of the tev source so that the radiation mechanism will be finally discovered ( bttcher & dermer 1995 ; levinson 2000 ; neronov & aharonian 2007 ; rieger & aharonian 2008 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) _ the motion of the tev source_. for tev photons with specified trajectory , their optical depth is independent of the properties of the tev source .",
    "however , the beaming effects caused by relativistic motion of the tev source will help to avoid pair - production absorption of tev photons , in regard to the beaming of the intensity of tev photons along the direction of the relativistic motion , and the blueshift of the energy of tev photons by comparing with that in the source frame .",
    "this will modify the observed spectra of tev emission .",
    "interestingly , the present procedure modified by including beamed tev photons from relativistic jets can be applied to blazars , which are being powered by the standard accretion disks ( in flat spectrum radio quasars ) and the riafs ( in high - frequency peaked bl lacs , such as mkn 421 and mkn 501 ) ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) _ the vertical structure of the riafs_. an exponential profile of the density has been adopted in the vertical direction of the riafs , which means that most soft photons are emanating from the midplane .",
    "future three - dimensional simulations of the accretion flows will give a more realistic description of the riaf structures . in this sense",
    ", the optical depth of the tev photons should be calculated in a more sophisticated way .",
    "\\(4 ) _ the time - dependent trajectories of tev photons_. future detectors with large area will receive more tev photons and be able to give more details of spectral variabilities .",
    "this needs a consideration on the time - dependent trajectories of tev photons in light of @xmath153 ( time - dependent pair productions when @xmath280 ) , for example , the periodic rotation of the tev source around the central smbh .",
    "this will definitely provide much more information about the innermost region near the black hole s horizon .    in other words ,",
    "further detailed theoretical work is needed for stronger limits on smbh spins from future observations .",
    "the current calculations based on the gr riaf model provide valuable constraints on the target fields of tev photons and therefore on the spins .",
    "the optical depth to energetic tev photons , which are immersed in the radiation fields from radiatively inefficient accretion flows , has been calculated in detail by including all the gr effects .",
    "we investigate the dependence of optical depth on the spins ( @xmath83 ) , accretion rates ( @xmath181 ) , viewing angles ( @xmath100 ) , and location of the tev photons ( @xmath281 ) .",
    "we find that the optical depth is more sensitive to @xmath107 than to @xmath100 and @xmath108 .",
    "one of the most interesting results is that @xmath153 strongly depends on the accretion rates as @xmath282 .",
    "applying the dependence of optical depth on @xmath107 to constrain the spin parameter in m87 , wherein the riafs are expected to be at work , we find that the observed tev photons detected by hess can escape from the radiation fields from the riafs with spin @xmath283 . future observations of the phase ii hess with threshold energy one order higher than that of the phase i may discover more m87-like objects ( e.g. , low - luminosity agns ) with tev emission . hopefully , we then will have a sample for the statistic sample of spins of smbhs .",
