    "the interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity is one of the challenging issues in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "this follows from a fact that the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are a form of non - conductor called a mott insulator with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order ( aflro ) @xcite , where a single common structural feature is the presence of the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "furthermore , the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments have shown that the low - energy spin excitations in these parent compounds are well described by an af heisenberg model @xcite with magnetic exchange coupling constant @xmath1 ev .",
    "the spin excitations with aflro are called as magnons . when the cuo@xmath0 planes are doped with charge carriers",
    ", the aflro phase subsides and superconductivity emerges leaving the af short - range order ( afsro ) correlations still intact .",
    "this afsro can still support spin waves , but the spin excitations with afsro are damped .",
    "the damped spin excitations are known as paramagnons @xcite . in particular , in the doped regime , the charge carriers couple to the spin excitations @xcite , and it has been argued that if the spin excitations exist over a wide enough range of energies , they can produce the necessary attractive interaction to induce superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the early ins measurements @xcite on cuprate superconductors have demonstrated that the doped charge carriers cause substantial changes to the low - energy spin excitation spectrum , and a consistent pattern has been identified as the _ hour - glass - shaped _ dispersion . this hour - glass - shaped dispersion was first observed in the spin excitations of yba@xmath0cu@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite and la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 @xcite , where two incommensurate ( ic ) components of the low - energy spin excitation spectrum are separated by a commensurate resonance energy @xmath7 at the waist of the hour glass . in the upward component , above the commensurate resonance energy @xmath7 ,",
    "the spin excitation spectrum is similar to what one would expect from af spin fluctuations with a finite gap , and it is relevant to the results for different families of cuprate superconductors that appear to scale with the magnetic exchange coupling constant @xmath8 for the parent mott insulators .",
    "moreover , for a given excitation energy , the magnetic scattering peaks lie on a circle of radius of @xmath9 , with the incommensurability parameter @xmath9 that is defined as a deviation of the peak position from the af wave vector @xmath10 $ ] ( hereafter we use the units of @xmath11 $ ] ) in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and then the distribution of the spectral weight of the ic magnetic scattering peaks is rather isotropic . on the other hand , in the downward component , below @xmath7 ,",
    "the distribution of the spectral weight of the ic magnetic scattering peaks is quite anisotropic @xcite . in particular , it is remarkable @xcite that in analogy to the domelike shape of the doping dependence of the sc transition temperature @xmath12 , the commensurate resonance energy @xmath7 increases with increasing doping in the underdoped regime , and reaches a maximum around the optimal doping , then decreases in the overdoped regime , reflecting a intrinsical relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "although the ic magnetic scattering has been also observed in the normal - state , the commensurate resonance is a new feature that appears in the sc - state _ only _ @xcite .",
    "later , this hour - glass - shaped dispersion was found in several different families of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "however , because of technical limitations , only the low - energy ( @xmath13 mev ) spin excitations in a small range of momentum space around the af wave vector are detected by the ins measurements @xcite , and they may be insufficient to produce superconductivity @xcite . in recent years , instrumentation for resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) with both soft and hard x - rays has improved dramatically , allowing this technique to directly measure the high - energy ( @xmath14 mev ) spin excitations of cuprate superconductors in the wide energy - momentum window that can not be detected by the ins measurements @xcite . in this case , as a compensation for the miss of a significant part of the spectral weight of the spin excitations in the ins studies @xcite , the rixs experiments @xcite have purported to measure high - energy spin excitations in a large family of cuprate superconductors that persist well into the overdoped regime and bear a striking resemblance to those found in the parent compound @xcite , indicating that a local - moment picture accounts for the observed spin excitations at elevated energies even up to the overdoped regime .",
    "in particular , the very importance is that the combined these rixs - ins experimental data have identified the spin excitations with high intensity over a large part of moment space , and shown that the spin excitations exist across the entire range of the sc dome , and with sufficient intensity to mediate superconductivity in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "although the spin excitation spectrum of cuprate superconductors from low - energy to high - energy in the whole doping phase diagram is well - established from the ins @xcite and rixs @xcite measurements , its full understanding is still a challenging issue . in our early studies @xcite ,",
    "the low - energy spin excitations of the underdoped cuprate superconductors in the normal - state has been discussed by considering spin fluctuations around the mean - field ( mf ) solution , where the spin self - energy is evaluated from the charge carrier bubble in the particle - hole channel , and then the obtained results are qualitatively consistent with the corresponding experimental data . in this paper , as a complement of our previous analysis of the low - energy spin excitations of the underdoped cuprate superconductors in the normal - state , we start from the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite to discuss the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors from low - energy to high - energy in both the sc- and normal - states , where one of our main results is that the both damped but well - defined dispersive low - energy and high - energy spin excitations exist across the whole doping phase diagram .",
    "the low - energy spin excitations are strongly renormalized due to the charge carrier - spin interaction to form an hour - glass - shaped dispersion in the sc - state . in particular , we identify that the commensurate resonance is closely related to the process of the creation of charge carrier pairs , and appears in the sc - state only , while the low - energy ic magnetic scattering is mainly associated with the motion of charge carrier quasiparticles , and",
    "therefore can persist into the normal - state . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge carrier doping has a more modest effect on the high - energy spin excitations , and then the high - energy spin fluctuations bear a striking resemblance to those found in the parent compound .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formalism is presented in sec .",
    "[ framework ] , where we evaluate explicitly the full spin green s function ( then the spin self - energy ) in the sc - state in terms of the collective charge carrier modes in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels . the dynamical spin structure factor",
    ", however , is obtained from the imaginary part of the full spin green s function , and is employed to discuss the quantitative characteristics of the dynamical spin response in cuprate superconductors in sec .",
    "[ sc - state ] for the sc - state and sec .",
    "[ normal - state ] for the normal - state , where we show that although the magnetic scattering of spins dominates the spin dynamics , the effect of charge carriers on the spin part in terms of the spin self - energy renormalization is critical in determining the doping and energy dependence of the dynamical spin response in cuprate superconductors .",
    "since the single common element in cuprate superconductors is the presence of the cuo@xmath0 planes as mentioned above , it is believed that the anomalous properties are closely related to the doped cuo@xmath0 planes @xcite .",
    "in particular , as originally emphasized by anderson @xcite , the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath0 plane is properly captured by the @xmath15-@xmath8 model on a square lattice , @xmath16 where the summation is over all sites @xmath17 , and for each @xmath17 , over its nearest - neighbors @xmath18 or the next nearest - neighbors @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath22 are spin operators , @xmath15 ( @xmath23 ) is the nearest - neighbor ( next nearest - neighbor ) hopping integral , @xmath8 is the af exchange coupling constant , and @xmath24 is the chemical potential . in this @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ tjham ] ) , the kinetic energy term describes the motion of charge carriers , while the heisenberg term describes the af coupling between localized spins .",
    "in particular , the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath15 in the kinetic energy term is much larger than the af exchange coupling constant @xmath8 in the heisenberg term , and then the af spin configuration is strongly affected by the motion of charge carriers .",
    "the high complexity in the @xmath15-@xmath8 model comes mainly from the local constraint of no double electron occupancy , i.e. , @xmath25 , which can be treated properly within the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the constrained electron operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 are decoupled as , @xmath28 respectively , with the fermion operator @xmath29 that keeps track of the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath30 represents the spin degree of freedom , and then the local constraint of no double electron occupancy is always satisfied in analytical calculations . in this css fermion - spin representation ( [ css ] ) , the original @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ tjham ] ) can be expressed explicitly as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the spin - lowering and spin - raising operators for the spin @xmath34 , respectively , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the charge carrier doping concentration . as a consequence",
    ", the kinetic energy in the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ cssham ] ) has been released as the charge carrier - spin interaction , which reflects that even the kinetic energy in the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ tjham ] ) has strong coulombic contribution due to the restriction of no double electron occupancy of a given site , and therefore dominates the essential physics of cuprate superconductors .",
    "superconductivity , the dissipationless flow of electrical current , is a striking manifestation of a subtle form of quantum rigidity on the macroscopic scale .",
    "it is commonly believed that the electron cooper pairs are crucial because these electron cooper pairs behave as effective bosons , and can form something analogous to a bose condensate that flows without resistance @xcite .",
    "this follows from a fact that although electrons repel each other because of the coulomb interaction , at low energies there can be an effective attraction that originates by the exchange of bosons @xcite . in conventional superconductors ,",
    "as explained by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite , these exchanged bosons are _ phonons _ that act like a bosonic _ glue _ to hold the electron pairs together @xcite , then these electron cooper pairs condense into a coherent macroscopic quantum state that is insensitive to impurities and imperfections and hence conducts electricity without resistance . as in the case of conventional superconductors ,",
    "the pairing of electrons in cuprate superconductors occurs at @xmath12 , creating an energy gap in the electron excitation spectrum that serves as the sc order parameter @xcite .",
    "the bcs theory is not specific to a phonon - mediated interaction , other excitations can also serve as the pairing glue @xcite . as we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] , the experimental results from the ins @xcite and rixs @xcite measurements have provided a clear link between the electron cooper pairing mechanism and spin excitations , then a question is raised whether the spin excitations , which is a generic consequence of the strong coulomb interaction , can mediate electron cooper pairing in cuprate superconductors in analogy to the phonon - mediate pairing mechanism in conventional superconductors @xcite ? within the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ cssham ] ) , we have developed a kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite , where cuprate superconductors involve charge carrier pairs bound together by the exchange of spin excitations , then the electron cooper pairs originating from charge carrier pairs are due to charge - spin recombination , and they condense to the d - wave sc ground - state . in particular ,",
    "one of the striking features in this kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite is that the afsro correlations coexist with superconductivity .",
    "the physical picture of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism is also quite clear @xcite : at half - filling , each lattice site is singly occupied by a spin - up or spin - down electron , then the electron spins are coupled antiferromagnetically with aflro . with doping , in particular , in the doped regime without an aflro , the charge carriers move in the spin liquid background , and form pairs at low temperatures in the particle - particle channel induced by the charge carrier - spin interaction directly from the kinetic energy of the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ cssham ] ) by exchanging spin excitations in higher powers of the doping concentration , then these charge carrier pairs ( then the electron cooper pairs ) condense to the sc - state .",
    "our following work builds on the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism in ref .",
    ", and only a short summary of the formalism is therefore given .",
    "in our previous discussions , the full charge carrier diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions of the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ cssham ] ) in the sc - state have been given explicitly as @xcite ,    [ bcshgf ] @xmath37    where the charge carrier quasiparticle spectrum @xmath38 , the charge carrier quasiparticle coherence factors @xmath39/2 $ ] and @xmath40/2 $ ] , the renormalized charge carrier excitation spectrum @xmath41 , the charge carrier excitation spectrum @xmath42 , with the spin correlation functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the number of the nearest - neighbor or next nearest - neighbor sites on a square lattice , the renormalized charge carrier pair gap @xmath48 , while the charge carrier pair gap is closely related to the charge carrier self - energy in the particle - particle channel as @xmath49 , and has a d - wave form @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "the charge carrier quasiparticle coherent weight is obtained from the antisymmetric part of the charge carrier self - energy in the particle - hole channel as @xmath52 with the wave vector @xmath53 that has been chosen as @xmath54 $ ] just as it has been done in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the charge carrier self - energies @xmath55 in the particle - hole channel and @xmath56 in the particle - particle channel have been evaluated from the spin bubble as @xcite ,    [ se ] @xmath57    respectively , with @xmath58 , and the spin bubble , @xmath59 where the mf spin green s function has been obtained explicitly as @xcite , @xmath60 with the mf spin excitation spectrum @xmath61 , and the function @xmath62 have been given in refs .",
    "in particular , it should be emphasized that all the order parameters and chemical potential @xmath24 in the above calculation have been determined by self - consistent calculation without using any adjustable parameters @xcite .    in the framework of the css fermion - spin theory ( [ css ] ) , the charge transport is mainly governed by the scattering of charge carriers due to the spin fluctuations @xcite , while the scattering of spins due to the charge carrier fluctuations dominates the spin dynamics @xcite . for the discussion of the dynamical spin response in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "we need to calculate the full spin green s function , which can be expressed as , @xmath63 in the sc - state , the spin fluctuations occur in the charge carrier quasiparticle background , and then the spin self - energy in the sc - state can be obtained within the framework of the equation of motion method in terms of the collective charge carrier modes in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels as ,      where the charge carrier bubble @xmath65 in the particle - hole channel is obtained from the full charge carrier diagonal green s function ( [ bcshdgf ] ) as , @xmath66 and is closely related to the motion of charge carrier quasiparticles , while the charge carrier bubble @xmath67 in the particle - particle channel is obtained from the full charge carrier off - diagonal green s function ( [ bcshodgf ] ) as , @xmath68 and therefore is directly associated with the creation of charge carrier pairs . substituting the full charge carrier green s function ( [ bcshgf ] ) and the mf spin green s function ( [ mfsgf ] ) into eqs .",

    "moreover , the low - energy ic magnetic scattering peaks lie on a circle of radius @xmath133 . although some ic satellite peaks along the diagonal direction appear , the main weight of the ic magnetic scattering peaks is in the parallel direction as in the case of the sc - state , and these peaks along the parallel direction are located at @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath90 $ ] .",

    "the essential physics of the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the normal - state is the same as in the sc - state , and also can be attributed to the spin self - energy effects which arise directly from the charge carrier - spin interaction in the kinetic energy of the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ cssham ] ) . however , in the sc - state , the spin self - energy renormalization in eq .",

    "( [ ssfn ] ) is due to the charge carrier bubble in the charge carrier particle - hole channel only , i.e. , only process from the mobile charge carrier quasiparticles contributes to the spin self - energy renormalization .",
    "this difference leads to an absence of the commensurate resonance from the normal - state .",
    "these results in the normal - state confirm again that the commensurate resonance appears in the sc - state only , while the low - energy ic magnetic scattering can persist into the normal - state . in particular , the effective band width @xmath124 of @xmath119 in the normal - state is almost the same as that in the corresponding sc - state , and then in analogy to the case in the sc - state , the spin self - energy in ( [ ssfn ] ) strongly renormalizes the spin excitations at energies below @xmath124 , but has a weak effect on the spin excitations at energies above @xmath124 .",
    "this is why the high - energy spin excitations in the normal - state retain roughly constant energy as a function of doping , with the shape of the magnetic scattering peaks , spectral weights and dispersion relations comparable to those in the corresponding sc - state .",

    "[ fig9ab ] ]    in cuprate superconductors , a small density of charge carriers is sufficient to destroy aflro , however , the doped charge carriers and magnetic exchange - coupled spins organize themselves in a cooperative way to enhance both charge carrier mobility and afsro correlations , and then the spin excitations in the spin liquid state with afsro appear to survive up to the high - energy @xcite . in the doped regime without aflro , we @xcite have shown within the framework of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism that the charge carrier - spin interaction directly from the kinetic energy of the @xmath15-@xmath8 model ( [ cssham ] ) by exchanging spin excitations in higher powers of the doping concentration induces the sc - state . in particular , although the kinetic energy increases with increasing doping , the strength @xmath137 of the charge carrier attractive interaction mediated by spin excitations in the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism smoothly decreases upon increasing doping from a strong - coupling case in the underdoped regime to a weak - coupling side in the overdoped regime as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9ab]a @xcite , reflecting a decrease of the intensity of the spin excitations with increasing doping . in the underdoped regime ,",
    "the coupling strength @xmath137 is very strong , and then most charge carriers can be bound to form charge carrier pairs . in this case , the number of the charge carrier pairs increases with increasing doping , which leads to an increase of @xmath12 with increasing doping .",
    "however , in the overdoped regime , the coupling strength @xmath137 is relatively weak . in this case ,",
    "not all charge carriers can be bound to form charge carrier pairs by the weakly attractive interaction , and therefore the number of the charge carrier pairs decreases with increasing doping , this leads to a decrease of @xmath12 with increasing doping . in other words ,",
    "the reduction in @xmath12 on the overdoped side is driven by a reduction in the coupling strength @xmath137 of the pairing interaction .",
    "in particular , the optimal doping is a balance point , where the number of charge carrier pairs and coupling strength are optimally matched .",
    "this is why @xmath12 takes a domelike shape with the underdoped and overdoped regimes on each side of the optimal doping , where @xmath12 reaches its maximum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9ab]b @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our present results show that the evolution of the spin excitations with doping in cuprate superconductors can be well described within the framework of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism from low - energy to high - energy .",
    "however , since the _ highest_-energy spin excitations in the sc - state retain roughly constant energy as a function of doping , with spectral weights and dispersion relations almost same with those in the corresponding normal - state , it is shown clearly from our present results based on the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism together with the data measured by the rixs experiments @xcite that the _ highest_-energy spin excitations are unlikely to be a major factor in the pairing interaction . in this case , the coupling strength of the pairing interaction comes mostly from the _ lower_-energy spin excitations , which change with doping and persist across the sc dome while retaining sufficient intensity .",
    "in particular , as a natural consequence of the suppression of the intensity of the magnetic scattering peaks with increasing doping , the coupling strength @xmath137 decreases with increasing doping , and in parallel with that @xmath12 reduces in the overdoped side .    to summarize , within the framework of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism , we have studied the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors from low - energy to high - energy .",

    "our results show the existence of damped but well - defined dispersive spin excitations in the whole doping phase diagram .",
