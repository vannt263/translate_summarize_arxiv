    "real random variables is given by the order statistics of @xmath13 .",
    "the fisher - tippett - gnedenko theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) thus implies that the limiting distribution of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath4 belongs either to the gumbel , frchet or weibull family .    in this paper",

    "for @xmath1 we set @xmath16 the matrices @xmath4 and @xmath2 are normalized in the sense that the eigenvalues of  @xmath4 and  @xmath2 are of order one .",
    "if @xmath2 belongs to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , the model   is called the deformed gue .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the edge eigenvalues of the deformed gue are governed by the tracy - widom distribution for @xmath17 . at @xmath18",
    "the fluctuations of the edge eigenvalues change from the tracy - widom to a gaussian distribution .",
    "more precisely , johansson showed in  @xcite that the limiting distribution of the edge eigenvalues for @xmath19 is given by the convolution of the tracy - widom and the centered gaussian distribution , with variance depending on @xmath20 .",

    "we primarily focus on the choices @xmath28 . from our first main result ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] , it follows that there are @xmath3-independent constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 , such that , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the largest eigenvalue @xmath33 of @xmath8 satisfies @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a _ weibull distribution _ with parameter @xmath36 ; see  .",
    "however , if @xmath11 , then there are @xmath3-independent constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the cumulative distribution function of the centered _ gaussian distribution _ with variance  @xmath41 ; see appendix c. we remark that neither   nor   depend on the symmetry type of the wigner matrix @xmath2 .    the appearance of the weibull distribution in the model   is indeed expected when  @xmath22 grows sufficiently fast with @xmath3 , since in this case the diagonal matrix dominates the spectral properties of @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is quite surprising that the weibull distribution already appears for @xmath22 order one , since the local behavior of the eigenvalues in the bulk of the deformed model mainly stems from the wigner part , and the contribution from the random diagonal part is limited to mesoscopic fluctuations of the eigenvalues ; see  @xcite .",
    "having identified two possible limiting distributions of the largest eigenvalues , it is natural to ask about the behavior of the associated eigenvectors . before considering the deformed model ,",
    "we recall that the eigenvectors of wigner matrices with subexponential decay are completely delocalized , as was proved by erds , schlein and yau @xcite .    for deformed wigner matrices",
    "we show that the eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalues are _ partially localized _ in the regime where the edge behavior   holds .",
    "more precisely , we prove that one component of the ( @xmath42-normalized ) eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues at the extreme edge carries a weight of order one , while the other components each carry a weight of order @xmath43 ; see theorem  [ thm : local ] .",
    "if , however , the edge behavior   holds , all eigenvectors are completely delocalized .",
    "although we do not prove it explicitly , we claim that the bulk eigenvectors of the model   with   for the choice of @xmath44 , are completely delocalized ( for any choice of @xmath21 ) .",
    "this can be proved with the very same methods as in  @xcite . to understand the transition from partial localization to delocalization",
    ", further efforts are required .",
    "the phenomenology described above is reminiscent of the one for heavy - tailed wigner matrices .",
    "for instance , consider real symmetric wigner matrices whose entries distribution function decays as a power law , i.e. , @xmath45 for some slowly varying function @xmath46 .",
    "it was proved by soshnikov  @xcite that the linear statistics of the largest eigenvalues are poissonian for @xmath47 ; in particular , the largest eigenvalue has a frchet limit distribution .",
    "later , auffinger , ben arous and pch  @xcite showed that the same conclusions hold for @xmath48 as well .",
    "recently , it was proved by bordenave and guionnet  @xcite that the eigenvectors of models satisfying   are weakly delocalized for @xmath49 . for @xmath50 , it is conjectured  @xcite that there is a sharp `` metal - insulator '' transition . in  @xcite it",
    "is proved that the eigenvectors of sufficiently large eigenvalues are weakly localized for @xmath51 .    to clarify the terminology `` partial localization ''",
    "we remark that it is quite different from the usual notion of localization for random schrdinger operators .",
    "the telltale signature of localization for random schrdinger operators is an exponential decay of off - diagonal green function entries , which implies the absence of diffusion , spectral localization etc .",
    "for the anderson model in dimensions @xmath52 such an exponential decay was first obtained by frhlich and spencer  @xcite using a multiscale analysis .",
    "later , a similar bound was presented by aizenman and molchanov @xcite using fractional moments . due to the mean - field nature of the wigner matrix @xmath2 ,",
    "there is no notion of distance for the deformed model  . instead , our localization result states that most of the mass of the eigenvectors is concentrated on a few sites , whose locations are independent and uniformly distributed .",
    "this result agrees with the predictions of formal perturbation theory .    yet",
    ", there are some similarities with the anderson model in @xmath52 : in the anderson model localization occurs where the density of states is ( exponentially ) small  @xcite ; this is known to happen close to the spectral edges or for large disorder .",
    "further it is strongly believed that the anderson model admits extended states , i.e. , the generalized eigenvectors in the bulk are expected to be delocalized .",
    "moreover , it was proven by minami  @xcite that the local eigenvalue statistics of the anderson model can be described by a poisson point process in the strong localization regime .",
    "it is also conjectured that the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk are given by the goe statistics , respectively gue statistics if time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "we remark that there are some partial results on bulk universality for the deformed model  ; see  @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the localization result we prove in this paper also differs from that for random band matrices , where all the eigenvectors are localized , even in the bulk .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the localization / delocalization for random band matrices .",
    "next , we outline the proofs of our main results .",
    "it was first shown by pastur  @xcite that the empirical eigenvalue distribution of the deformed model   converges to a deterministic distribution in the limit @xmath10 under some weak assumption on @xmath6 . however , this limiting eigenvalue distribution , referred to as the _ deformed semicircle law _ in the following , is in general different from wigner s semicircle law and depends on the limiting distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "the deformed semicircle law can be defined in terms of a functional equation for the stieltjes transforms of the limiting eigenvalue distributions of  @xmath6 and  @xmath2  @xcite . restricting the discussion to the special case",
    "when the entries of @xmath4 follow the centered jacobi distribution in   with @xmath31 , we showed in  @xcite that the deformed semicircle law , henceforth denoted by @xmath53 , is supported on a single interval and shows either of the following behavior close to the upper edge : @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the distance from @xmath58 to the upper endpoint of the support of  @xmath53 ; see lemma  [ general case - large lambda ] below . in case",
    "the square root behavior prevails , we are going to show that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath8 satisfies  , whereas in case we have a `` convex decay '' with @xmath31 ,   is satisfied .    in a first step",
    ", we derive a _ local law _ for the empirical eigenvalue density : under some moment conditions the convergence of the empirical eigenvalue distribution to the semicircle law also holds on very small scales . denoting by @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the green function or resolvent of @xmath8 , convergence of the empirical eigenvalue distribution on scale @xmath61 around an energy @xmath62 is equivalent to the convergence of the averaged green function @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite erds , schlein and yau showed that the semicircle law for wigner matrices also holds down to the optimal scale @xmath65 , up to logarithmic corrections . in",
    "@xcite a `` fluctuation average lemma '' was introduced that yielded optimal bounds on the convergence of @xmath66 for wigner matrices in the bulk  @xcite and up to the edge  @xcite on scales @xmath67 . below this scale",
    "the eigenvalue density remains fluctuating even for large @xmath3 . in  @xcite the green function @xmath68 and its average @xmath66",
    "have been used to prove edge universality for generalized wigner matrices . in  @xcite we derived a _ local deformed semicircle law _ for the deformed ensemble   under the assumption that @xmath53 has a square root behavior at the endpoints .",
    "in the present paper , we derive a local law at the _ extreme edge _ in case @xmath53 shows a convex decay at the edge .",
    "we propose , however , a slightly different path than the one taken in  @xcite : we condition on the random variables  @xmath13 and show that  @xmath66 converges , for `` typical '' realizations of  @xmath13 , on scale  @xmath69 ; see proposition  [ prop : step 2_4 ] .",
    "in particular , we show that the typical eigenvalue spacing at the extreme edge is of order @xmath70 ; as is suggested by the convex decay in  .",
    "similar to the wigner case , see e.g. ,  @xcite , this is accomplished by deriving a self - consistent equation for  @xmath66 .",
    "however , the analysis of the self - consistent equation is quite different from the wigner case , due to the absence of the usual stability bound ; see  @xcite .    in a second step",
    ", we can use the self - averaging property of the wigner matrix @xmath2 , to show that the _ imaginary part _ of @xmath71 can be controlled on scales much smaller than @xmath72 : the technical input here is the `` fluctuation averaging lemma ''  @xcite .",
    "our proof relies on the basic strategy of @xcite . however , in our setup the diagonal entries of @xmath73 are not uniformly bounded , which requires several changes to previous arguments . to complete the proof of our first main result , theorem  [ thm : local ]",
    ", we note that the imaginary part of @xmath71 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the eigenvalues of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , having control on the left side for @xmath76 allows tracking the individual eigenvalues at the extreme edge , where their typical spacing much bigger than  @xmath72 .    finally , we point out the main steps in the proof of the partial localization of eigenvectors ; see theorem  [ thm : local ] for precise results .",
    "it is well - known that information on the averaged green function @xmath66 can be translated via the helffer - sjstrand formula to information on the density of states ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "since the typical eigenvalue spacing at the edge is , for the case at hand , much larger than  @xmath72 , the helffer - sjstrand formula also allows to translate information on the diagonal green function entries @xmath77 into information on the eigenvectors at the edge . relying on estimates on the green function",
    ", we can then prove `` partial localization '' of the eigenvectors at the edge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ definition and results ] , we introduce the precise definition of the model and state the main results of the paper . in section [ prelim ]",
    ", we collect basic notations and identities for the resolvent of @xmath8 . in section  [ mfc and hat mfc ] , we prove the first main result of the paper , theorem [ thm : main ] , using estimates on the stieltjes transform of the deformed semicircle measure .",
