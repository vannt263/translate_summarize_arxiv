    "astrophysical turbulence is ubiquitous and it holds the key to many astrophysical processes ( star formation , heating of the interstellar medium , properties of accretion disks , cosmic ray transport etc ) . therefore understanding of turbulence is a necessary requirement for making further progress along any of those directions . unlike laboratory turbulence astrophysical turbulence is magnetized and highly compressible .",
    "turbulence has been studied in the context of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the solar wind .",
    "the ism in the milky way and neighboring galaxies is known to be turbulent on scales ranging from aus to kpc ( armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 ; stanimirovic & lazarian 2001 ; deshpande et al .",
    "the solar wind also exhibits small - scale turbulence ( leamon et al .",
    "the measured statistics of fluctuations in the ism and the solar wind is consistent with the kolmogorov turbulence obtained for incompressible unmagnetized fluid .",
    "this surprising observational evidence resulted in numerous attempts to use kolmogorov statistics for practical computations of astrophysical quantities , e.g. cosmic ray scattering .",
    "we shall show below that in most cases such sort of calculations brings _ erroneous _ results .",
    "why would we expect astrophysical fluids to be turbulent and how can we study astrophysical turbulence ?",
    "a fluid of viscosity @xmath3 gets turbulent when the rate of viscous dissipation , which is @xmath4 at the energy injection scale @xmath5 , is much smaller than the energy transfer rate @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the velocity dispersion at the scale @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of the two rates is the reynolds number @xmath8 . in general , when @xmath9 is larger than @xmath10 the system becomes turbulent .",
    "chaotic structures develop gradually as @xmath9 increases , and those with @xmath11 are appreciably less chaotic than those with @xmath12 . observed features such as star forming clouds are very chaotic for @xmath13 .",
    "this not only ensures that the fluids are turbulent but also makes it difficult to simulate the turbulence .",
    "the currently available 3d simulations for 512 cubes can have @xmath9 up to @xmath14 and are limited by their grid sizes .",
    "therefore , it is essential to find  _ scaling laws _ \" in order to extrapolate numerical calculations ( @xmath15 ) to real astrophysical fluids ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we show below that even with its limited resolution , numerics is a great tool for _ testing _ scaling laws .",
    "kolmogorov theory provides a scaling law for incompressible _",
    "non_-magnetized hydrodynamic turbulence ( kolmogorov 1941 ) .",
    "this law is true in the statistical sense and it provides a relation between the relative velocity @xmath16 of fluid elements and their separation @xmath17 , namely , @xmath18 . an equivalent description is to express spectrum @xmath19 as a function of wave number @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the two descriptions are related by @xmath22 .",
    "the famous kolmogorov spectrum is @xmath23 .",
    "the applications of kolmogorov theory range from engineering research to meteorology ( see monin & yaglom 1975 ) but its astrophysical applications are poorly justified .",
    "let us consider _ incompressible _ mhd turbulence first .",
    "there have long been understanding that the mhd turbulence is anisotropic ( e.g. shebalin et al .",
    "a substantial progress has been achieved recently by goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ; hereafter gs95 ) who made an ingenious prediction regarding relative motions parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field * b * for incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "the gs95 model envisages a kolmogorov spectrum of velocity and a scale - dependent anisotropy ( see below ) .",
    "these relations have been confirmed numerically ( cho & vishniac 2000b ; maron & goldreich 2001 ; cho , lazarian & vishniac 2002a , hereafter clv02a ; see also clv03a ) ; they are in good agreement with observed and inferred astrophysical spectra ( see clv03a ) . a remarkable fact revealed in clv02a is that fluid motions perpendicular to * b * are _ identical _ to hydrodynamic motions .",
    "this provides an essential physical insight into why in some respects mhd turbulence and hydrodynamic turbulence are similar , while in other respects they are different .    the gs95 model considered incompressible mhd , but the real ism is _",
    "highly compressible_. literature on the properties of compressible mhd is very rich ( see clv03a ) .",
    "back in 80 s higdon ( 1984 ) theoretically studied density fluctuations in the interstellar mhd turbulence .",
    "matthaeus & brown ( 1988 ) studied nearly incompressible mhd at low mach number and zank & matthaeus ( 1993 ) extended it . in an important paper matthaeus et al .",
    "( 1996 ) numerically explored anisotropy of compressible mhd turbulence .",
    "however , those papers do not provide universal scalings of the gs95 type .",
    "is it feasible to obtain scaling relations for the compressible mhd turbulence ?",
    "some hints about effects of compressibility can be inferred from the goldreich & sridhar ( gs95 ) seminal paper .",
    "a more focused discussion was presented in the lithwick & goldreich ( 2001 ) paper which deals with electron density fluctuations in the gas pressure dominated plasma , i.e. in high @xmath0 regime ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "incompressible regime formally corresponds to @xmath25 and therefore it is natural to expect that for @xmath26 the gs95 picture would persist .",
    "lithwick & goldreich ( 2001 ) also speculated that for low @xmath0 plasmas the gs95 scaling of slow modes may be applicable . an important study of mhd modes in compressible low @xmath0 plasmas is given in cho & lazarian ( 2002 ; hereafter cl02 ) where we developed and tested our technique of separating different mhd modes .    in this work",
    ", we provide a detailed study of mode coupling and scalings of compressible ( fast and slow ) and alfvenic modes in high @xmath0 , intermediate , and low @xmath0 plasmas .",
    "our approach is complementary to that employed in direct numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence . in such simulations ,",
    "e.g. in those dealing with the interstellar medium ( see vazquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2000 ) , simulations of particular astrophysical objects , e.g. molecular clouds , are attempted .",
    "these simulations provide synthetic maps that can be compared with observations .",
    "our goal is to obtain scaling laws that can also be compared with observations . in  2 , we describe our approach to the problem including both simple theoretical considerations / expectations that motivate our study and the numerical technique that we employ . in  3 , we present velocity spectra and anisotropies for high and low @xmath0 plasmas . in ",
    "4 , we discuss scalings of density and magnetic field . in  5 , we present the study of viscosity - damped regime of mhd turbulence in compressible fluid .",
    "this study extends our earlier work ( cho , lazarian , & vishniac 2002b , henceforth clv02b ) where this regime was reported for incompressible flows . in  6 , we discuss astrophysical implications of our results , including the rate of mhd turbulence decay , relation between the decay rate and compressibility , correlation of density and magnetic field , and formation of density structures at au scale .",
    "the summary is given in  7 .",
    "let us start with a discussion why isotropic kolmogorov turbulence _ can not _ be applicable for describing strongly magnetized gas .",
    "assume that , at some large scale @xmath5 , the magnetic energy and kinetic energy are equal : @xmath27 . according to the kolmogorov theory ,",
    "the kinetic energy at scale @xmath28 is @xmath29 , which is smaller than the large scale kinetic energy by a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "but , magnetic energy density does not diminish as the scale reduces .",
    "therefore , at scales smaller than @xmath5 , hydrodynamic motions will not be able to bend magnetic field lines substantially .",
    "an important observation that leads to understanding of the gs95 scaling is that magnetic field can not prevent mixing motions of magnetic field lines if the motions are perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "those motions will cause , however , waves that will propagate along magnetic field lines .",
    "if that is the case , the time scale of the wave - like motions , i.e. @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the characteristic size of the perturbation along the magnetic field and @xmath33 is the local alfven speed , will be equal to the hydrodynamic time - scale , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the characteristic size of the perturbation perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the mixing motions are hydrodynamic - like and therefore obey kolmogorov scaling @xmath36 . combining the two relations above",
    "we can get the gs95 anisotropy , @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 in terms of wave - numbers ) .",
    "if we interpret @xmath32 as the eddy size in the direction of the local magnetic field and @xmath35 as that in the perpendicular directions , the relation implies that smaller eddies are more elongated ( see appendix b for illustration of scale - dependent anisotropy ) .",
    "how is this idealized incompressible model related to the actual , e.g. interstellar , turbulence ?",
    "compressible mhd turbulence is a highly non - linear phenomenon and it has been thought that different types of perturbations or modes ( alfven , slow and fast ) in compressible media are strongly coupled .",
    "nevertheless , one may question whether this is true .",
    "a remarkable feature of the gs95 model is that alfven perturbations cascade to small scales over just one wave period , while the other non - linear interactions require more time .",
    "therefore one might expect that the non - linear interactions with other types of waves should affect alfvenic cascade only marginally .",
    "moreover , as the alfven waves are incompressible , the properties of the corresponding cascade may not depend on the sonic mach number .",
    "the generation of compressible motions ( i.e. _ radial _ components in fourier space ) from alfvenic turbulence is a measure of mode coupling .",
    "how much energy in compressible motions is drained from alfvenic cascade ? according to the closure calculations ( bertoglio , bataille , & marion 2001 ; see also zank & matthaeus 1993 ) , the energy in compressible modes in _ hydrodynamic _ turbulence scales as @xmath39 if @xmath40 .",
    "we may conjecture that this relation can be extended to mhd turbulence if , instead of @xmath41 , we use @xmath42 .",
    "( hereinafter , we define @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mean magnetic field strength . )",
    "however , as the alfven modes are anisotropic , this formula may require an additional factor .",
    "the compressible modes are generated inside the so - called goldreich - sridhar cone , which takes up @xmath45 of the wave vector space .",
    "the ratio of compressible to alfvenic energy inside this cone is the ratio given above .",
    "if the generated fast modes become isotropic ( see below ) , the diffusion or , `` isotropization '' of the fast wave energy in the wave vector space increase their energy by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "this results in @xmath47^{-1 } , \\label{eq_high2}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are energy of compressible and alfven modes , respectively .",
    "( [ eq_high2 ] ) suggests that the drain of energy from alfvenic cascade is marginal when the amplitudes of perturbations are weak , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "if alfven cascade evolves on its own , it is natural to assume that slow modes exhibit the gs95 scaling .",
    "indeed , slow modes in gas pressure dominated environment ( high @xmath0 plasmas ) are similar to the pseudo - alfven modes in incompressible regime ( see gs95 ; lithwick & goldreich 2001 ) .",
    "the latter modes do follow the gs95 scaling . in magnetic pressure dominated environments ( low @xmath0 plasmas ) , slow modes are density perturbations propagating with the sound speed @xmath51 parallel to the mean magnetic field ( see equation ( [ xis_lowbeta ] ) ) .",
    "those perturbations are essentially static for @xmath52 .",
    "therefore alfvenic turbulence is expected to mix density perturbations as if they were passive scalar .",
    "this also induces gs95 spectrum .",
    "the fast waves in low @xmath0 regime propagate at @xmath53 irrespectively of the magnetic field direction . in high @xmath0 regime ,",
    "the properties of fast modes are similar , but the propagation speed is the sound speed @xmath51 . thus the mixing motions induced by alfven waves should marginally affect the fast wave cascade .",
    "it is expected to be analogous to the acoustic wave cascade and hence be isotropic .    for most part of this paper",
    ", we shall assumed that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the r.m.s .",
    "strength of the random magnetic field .",
    "this is less restrictive than it might appear , since as long as there is some scale @xmath56 in the turbulent cascade where @xmath57 we can take @xmath58 , @xmath59 and use this model of turbulence for all smaller scales .",
    "suppose that we have a turbulent system initially threaded by a mean magnetic field only .",
    "if initially the turbulent energy is larger than the magnetic energy of the mean field , we are in the regime of so - called superalfvenic turbulence . in this regime the growth of the magnetic field is expected through so called `` turbulent dynamo '' ( see batchelor 1950 ; brandenburg et al .",
    "1996 ; cho & vishniac 2000a ) .",
    "initially , the growth of magnetic energy is most active at the scale roughly an order of magnitude larger than the dissipation scale and the magnetic spectrum peaks at the scale .",
    "as the magnetic energy grows , the magnetic back reaction becomes important at the scale and the peak of the magnetic power spectrum moves to larger scales .",
    "finally , when equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic energy densities occurs at a scale somewhat ( factor of 2 or 3 ) smaller than the kinetic energy peak , turbulence reaches a statistically stationary state .",
    "this agrees well with the results of incompressible simulations in cho & vishniac ( 2000a ) .",
    "however , this is not universally accepted idea . for example",
    ", padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) reported that , in their compressible simulations , the power spectrum of @xmath60 has a shallower slope then those of velocity and magnetic field , which implies that equipartition between kinetic magnetic energy can not be reached at small scales . at scales smaller than the equipartition scale ,",
    "the turbulence becomes subalfvenic and our earlier considerations should be applicable .",
    "the arguments above suggest that compressible mhd turbulence should demonstrate well defined scaling relations .",
    "below we test those arguments and reveal scaling relations for different @xmath0s and mach numbers .",
    "we use a third - order accurate hybrid essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) scheme ( see cl02 ) to solve the ideal isothermal mhd equations in a periodic box : @xmath61 with @xmath62 and an isothermal equation of state . here",
    "@xmath63 is a random large - scale driving force , @xmath64 is density , @xmath65 is the velocity , and @xmath66 is magnetic field .",
    "the rms velocity @xmath67 is maintained to be approximately unity ( in fact @xmath68 ) , so that @xmath65 can be viewed as the velocity measured in units of the r.m.s .",
    "velocity of the system and @xmath69 as the alfvn velocity in the same units .",
    "the time @xmath70 is in units of the large eddy turnover time ( @xmath71 ) and the length in units of @xmath5 , the scale of the energy injection .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath72 .    for mode coupling studies ( fig .",
    "[ fig_coupling ] ) , we do _ not _ drive turbulence . for scaling studies , we drive turbulence solenoidally in fourier space and use @xmath73 points , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the average rms velocity in statistically stationary state is @xmath76 .    for our calculations",
    "we assume that @xmath77 . in this case , the sound speed is the controlling parameter and basically two regimes can exist : supersonic and subsonic .",
    "note that supersonic means low - beta and subsonic means high - beta . when supersonic , we consider mildly supersonic ( or , mildly low-@xmath0 ) and highly supersonic ( or , very low-@xmath0 ) of order unity ) . ] .",
    "three types of waves exist ( alfven , slow and fast ) in compressible magnetized plasma .",
    "the slow , fast , and alfven bases that denote the direction of displacement vectors for each mode are given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the angle between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the azimuthal basis in the spherical polar coordinate system .",

    "we obtain energy spectra using this projection method .",
    "when we calculate the structure functions ( e.g.  for alfvn velocity ) in real space , we first obtain the fourier components using the projection and , then , we obtain the real space values by performing fourier transform .",

    "we substantially extend the cl02 analysis . as mentioned above",
    ", the coupling of compressible and incompressible modes is crucial . if alfvenic modes produce a copious amount of compressible modes , the whole picture of independent alfvenic turbulence fails .",

    "in hydrodynamic turbulence viscosity sets a minimal scale for motion , with an exponential suppression of motion on smaller scales .",
    "below the viscous cutoff the kinetic energy contained in a wavenumber band is dissipated at that scale , instead of being transferred to smaller scales .",
    "this means the end of the hydrodynamic cascade , but in mhd turbulence this is not the end of magnetic structure evolution . for viscosity",
    "much larger than resistivity , @xmath150 , there will be a broad range of scales where viscosity is important but resistivity is not . on these scales",
    "magnetic field structures will be created by the shear from non - damped turbulent motions , which amounts essentially to the shear from the smallest undamped scales .",
    "the created magnetic structures would evolve through generating small scale motions . as a result",

    "further research showed that there is a smooth connection between this regime and small scale turbulent dynamo in high magnetic prandtl number fluids ( see schekochihin et al .",
    "2002 ) 1 ) .",
    "although the analogy was later proved to be physically wrong , the high magnetic prandtl number dynamo has been studied by many researchers ( e.g. kulsrud & anderson 1992 ; kinney et al .",

    "( see draine & lazarian 1999 for a list of the idealized phases ) this produces damping on the scale of a fraction of a parsec .",
    "the magnetic diffusion in those circumstances is still negligible and exerts an influence only at the much smaller scales , @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , there is a large range of scales where the physics of the turbulent cascade is very different from the conventional mhd turbulence picture .",
    "clv02b explored this regime numerically with a grid of @xmath153 and a physical viscosity for velocity damping .",
    "the kinetic reynolds number was around 100 .",
    "we achieved a very small magnetic diffusivity by the use of hyper - diffusion .",
    "the result is presented in fig .  [ fig_viscous]a . a theoretical model for this regime and its consequences for stochastic reconnection ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) can be found in lazarian , vishniac , & cho ( 2003 ) .",

    "therefore the compressibility should not alter the physics of this regime of turbulence .",
    "we show our results for the compressible fluid in fig  [ fig_viscous]b .",
    "we use the same physical viscosity as in incompressible case ( see clv02b ) .",
    "we rely on numerical diffusion , which is much smaller than physical viscosity , for magnetic field .",
    "the inertial range is much smaller due to numerical reasons , but it is clear that the viscosity - damped regime of mhd turbulence persists . the magnetic fluctuations , however , compress the gas and thus cause fluctuations in density .",
    "this is a new ( although expected ) phenomenon compared to our earlier incompressible calculations .",
    "these density fluctuations may have important consequences for the small scale structure of the ism .",
    "parameters of astrophysical plasmas differ substantially for different astrophysical systems : from extremely high @xmath0 to extremely low @xmath0 .",
    "turbulence in some systems is expected to be superalfvenic , in others it is expected to be subalfvenic .",
    "moreover , there is an ongoing controversy on what to expect and where .",
    "for instance , while high @xmath0 was considered a default for many phases of milky way ism , recent observations by beck ( 2002 ) suggest that the plasmas there may be low @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is essential to have clear understanding of mhd turbulence for as large parameter space as possible .",
    "* superalfvenic regime. * we have argued above that the difference between superalfvenic and subalfvenic turbulence is not as substantial as it is frequently thought .",
    "the difference between the two regimes stems from ratio of magnetic field to kinetic energies .",
    "however , as we mentioned in  2 , if kinetic energy density exceed magnetic field energy density , the hydromagnetic motions drive turbulent dynamo .",
    "this enhances magnetic field energy density up to approximately equipartition value .",
    "thus the difference between the superalfvenic and subalfvenic regimes amounts not to the energy of the magnetic field , but to the global level of field organization , e.g. to the magnetic field reversals etc .",
    "our results in  [ sect_super ] suggest that the basic properties of the mhd turbulence in the subalfvenic and superalfvenic regimes are similar .",
    "this , however , does not preclude the intermittency of mhd turbulence being very different .",
    "the latter property can be tested using scalings of the higher order velocity correlations @xmath156 .",
    "the corresponding scaling suggested by she - leveque ( 1994 ) contains three parameters ( see politano & pouquet 1995 ; mller & biskamp 2000 ) : @xmath157 is related to the scaling @xmath158 , @xmath159 related to the energy cascade rate @xmath160 , and c , the co - dimension of the dissipative structures : @xmath161 mller & biskamp ( 2000 ) proposed that 3d _ incompressible _ mhd turbulence for _ zero mean field _ has kolmogorov @xmath157 and @xmath159 , while the the dissipation happens in the sheet - like structures , i.e. @xmath162 . using eq .",

    "it appears surprising that incompressible mhd ( mller & biskamp 2000 ) and supersonic compressible mhd ( boldyrev et al .",
    "2002a ) have similar intermittency structures .",
    "this issue is discussed in cho , lazarian , & vishniac ( 2003b ) .",
    "we would like to note , however , that our considerations about superalfvenic turbulence are not applicable to the transient regimes when superalfvenic motions are in the process of generating magnetic field and magnetic energy does not have time to come to a rough equipartition to the kinetic energy .",
    "some parts of the ism can well be in the transient regime for which temporary @xmath164 .",

    "[ fig_beta1 ] show that the scaling relations that hold true for mildly low @xmath0 regime are also applicable for @xmath165 regime .              *",
    "how fast does mhd turbulence decay ? * this question has fundamental implications for _ star formation _ ( see mckee 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , it was thought originally that magnetic fields would prevent turbulence from fast decay . later ( see mac low et al .",
    "1998 ; stone et al .  1998 ; and review by vazquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2000 ) this was reported not to be true .",
    "however , fast decay was erroneously associated with the coupling between compressible and incompressible modes .",
    "the idea was that incompressible motions quickly transfer their energy to the compressible modes , which get damped fast by direct dissipation ( presumably through shock formation ) .",
    "our calculations support the conjecture given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_high2 ] ) . according to it",
    "the coupling of alfven and compressible motions is important only at the energy injection scales where @xmath169 .",
    "as the turbulence evolves the perturbations become smaller and the coupling less efficient . typically for numerical simulations",
    "the inertial range is rather small and this could explain why marginal coupling of modes was not noticed .",
    "our results show that mhd turbulence damping does not depend on whether the fluid is compressible or not .",
    "the incompressible motions damp also within one eddy turnover time^{n}$ ] ( c. mckee , private communication ) , where @xmath170 is the energy at the initial time @xmath171 .",
    "our claim is that decay of turbulence follows @xmath172^{n}$ ] , where @xmath173 is the eddy turn - over time at @xmath174 and @xmath175 is a constant of order unity . ] .",
    "this is the consequence of the fact that within the strong turbulence mixing motions perpendicular to magnetic field are hydrodynamic to high order ( clv02a ) and the cascade of energy induced by those motions is similar to the hydrodynamic one , i.e. energy cascade happens within an eddy turnover time .    the reported ( see mac low et al .",
    "1998 ) decay of the _ total _ energy of turbulent motions @xmath176 follows @xmath177 which can be understood if we account for the fact that the energy is being injected at the scale smaller than the scale of the system .",
    "therefore some energy originally diffuses to larger scales through the inverse cascade .",
    "our calculations stimulated by illuminating discussions with chris mckee show that if this energy transfer is artificially prevented by injecting the energy on the scale of the computational box , the scaling of @xmath176 becomes closer to @xmath178 .",
    "* can compressible mhd turbulence decay slowly ?",
    "* incompressible mhd computations ( see maron & goldreich 2001 ; clv02a ) show that the rate of turbulence decay depends on the degree of turbulence imbalance , i.e. the difference in the energy fluxes moving in opposite directions .",
    "the strongly imbalanced incompressible turbulence was shown to persist longer than its balanced counterpart .",
    "this enabled clv02a to speculate that this may enable energy transfer between clouds and may explain the observed turbulent linewidths of gmcs without evident star formation .",
    "imbalanced turbulence can also make it possible to transfer energy from the galactic disk to heat the reynolds layer ( see reynolds 1988 ) .",
    "our results above show a marginal coupling of compressible and incompressible modes .",
    "this is suggestive that the results obtained in incompressible simulations are applicable to compressible environments if amplitudes of perturbations are not large .",
    "the complication arises from the existence of the parametric instability ( del zanna , velli , & londrillo 2001 ) that happens as the density perturbations reflect alfven waves and grow in amplitude .",
    "this instability eventually controls the degree of imbalance that is achievable .",
    "however , the growth rate of the instability is substantially slower than the alfven wave oscillation rate . therefore , if we take into account that interstellar sources are intermittent not only in space , but also in time , the transport of turbulent energy described in clv02a seems feasible .",
    "here we mention that the growth of the parametric instability described above may provide an alternative explanation for the observed infall motions of the cloud cores ( tafalla et al .",
    "earlier those motions were explained as arising from linear damping of alfven waves ( myers & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "* is the correlation between magnetic field and density tight in mhd turbulence ? * in the traditional static paradigm of the ism , density and magnetic field increase simultaneously as clouds contract .",
    "introduction of turbulence in the picture of ism complicates the analysis ( see discussion in vazquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2000 ; clv03a ) .",
    "our results confirm earlier claims ( e.g. passot & vazquez - semadeni 2003 ) that magnetic field - density correlations may be weak .",
    "first of all , some magnetic field fluctuations are related to alfvenic turbulence which does not compress the medium .",
    "second , slow modes in low @xmath0 plasmas are essentially density perturbations that propagate along magnetic field and which marginally perturb magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , our calculations ( see fig .  [ fig_density ] ) show that at substantially high mach numbers the density correlations do not show anisotropies , while magnetic field fluctuations are anisotropic . on the basis of our calculations",
    "we might expect that the correlation may be a bit higher for high @xmath0 than for low @xmath0 plasmas .    *",
    "can viscously damped turbulence explain tsas ? * the term `` tiny - scale atomic structures '' or tsas was introduced by heiles ( 1997 ) to describe the mysterious h  i absorbing structures on scales from thousands to tens of au , discovered by dieter , welch & romney ( 1976 ) .",
    "analogs of tsas are observed in nai and caii ( meyer & blades 1996 ; faison & goss 2001 ; andrews , meyer , & lauroesch  2001 ) and in molecular gas ( marscher , moore , & bania 1993 ) .    those structures can be produced by turbulence with a spectrum substantially more shallow than the kolmogorov one , e.g. with the spectrum @xmath154 ( see deshpande 2000 ) .",
    "simulations in clv02b and theoretical calculations in lazarian , vishniac & cho ( 2003 ) show that the magnetic field in the viscosity - damped regime of mhd turbulence ( see  [ sect_new ] ) can produce such a spectrum of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "our calculations above are indicative that this will translate in the corresponding shallow spectrum of density .",
    "our calculations are applicable on scales from the viscous damping scale ( determined by equating the energy transfer rate with the viscous damping rate ; @xmath179 pc in the warm neutral medium with @xmath180 = 0.4 @xmath181 , @xmath182= 6000 k ) to the ion - neutral decoupling scale ( the scale at which viscous drag on ions becomes comparable to the neutral drag ; @xmath183 pc ) . below the viscous scale",
    "the fluctuations of magnetic field obey the damped regime shown in figure [ fig_viscous]b and produce density fluctuations .",
    "for typical cold neutral medium gas , the scale of neutral - ion decoupling decreases to @xmath184 au , and is less for denser gas .",
    "tsas may be created by strongly nonlinear mhd turbulence !",
    "many astrophysical problems require some knowledge of the scaling properties of turbulence .",
    "therefore we expect a wide range of applications of the established scaling relations . here",
    "we discuss how our understanding of mhd turbulence affects a few selected issues .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the observations ( see clv03a for a review ) indicate that interstellar spectrum exhibits kolmogorov - type scaling @xmath23 . on the basis of what we learned by now ( see also higdon 1983 , gs95 , lithwick & goldreich 2001 , cl02 )",
    "we may conclude that the mhd spectrum _ is different _ from the spectrum of isotropic kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "anisotropy of alfvenic and slow modes ensures that the observationally measured spectrum is dominated by perturbations perpendicular to the magnetic field , i.e. @xmath185 .",
    "admixture of fast modes can alter the spectrum , but observations indicate that those modes do not dominate the detected signal .",
    "whether or not one can use kolmogorov isotropic scaling for practical calculations depends on the nature of the problem .",
    "for instance , cho & lazarian ( 2002b ) use kolmogorov scaling to calculate the spectra of fluctuations arising from synchrotron emission and of fluctuations of the degree of starlight polarization and obtained good correspondence with the observed statistics .",
    "however , for many problems turbulence anisotropy is essential .    *",
    "cosmic rays. * the propagation of cosmic rays is mainly determined by their interactions with electromagnetic fluctuations in the interstellar medium .",
    "for practical calculations it is usually assumed that the turbulence is _ isotropic _ with a kolmogorov spectrum ( e.g. , schlickeiser & miller 1998 ) .",
    "how should these calculations be modified in view of our findings ?",
    "chandran ( 2000 ) and yan & lazarian ( 2002 ; see also lazarian , cho & yan 2002 for a review ) calculated the efficiency of cosmic ray scattering by alfvenic modes and found that , if the energy injected at large scales , the scattering by alfvenic modes is absolutely negligible . the difference between the calculations in yan & lazarian ( 2002 ) , which used the tensor description of alfven waves obtained in clv02a , and the calculations that use kolmogorov turbulence was 10 orders of magnitude !",
    "yan & lazarian ( 2002 ; 2003a ) identified fast modes as the principal source of cosmic ray scattering and used the cl02 results to calculate the scattering rate in low @xmath0 plasma .",
    "damping of those modes , however , depends on the value of @xmath0 , which entails the dependence of cosmic ray scattering on the temperature and density of the background plasmas .",
    "* dust dynamics. * turbulence induces relative dust grain motions and leads to grain - grain collisions .",
    "these collisions determine grain size distribution , which affects most dust properties , including absorption and h@xmath110 formation .",
    "unfortunately , as in the case of cosmic rays , earlier work appealed to hydrodynamic turbulence to predict grain relative velocities .",
    "lazarian & yan ( 2002 ) and yan & lazarian ( 2003b ) considered motions of charged grains in anisotropic mhd turbulence and found that the direct interaction of the charged grains with turbulent magnetic field results in a stochastic acceleration that can potentially provide grains with supersonic velocities .",
    "* other applications. * the obtained scaling laws are essential for understanding the density fluctuations within hii regions ( lithwick & goldreich 2001 ) , stochastic magnetic reconnection in fully ionized ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 , 2000 ) and partially ionized plasma ( lazarian , vishniac & cho 2003 ) , for energy transfer to electrons in gamma ray bursts and solar flares ( see lazarian , petrosian , yan , & cho 2003 ) .",
    "this list can be easily extended .",
    "in the paper , we have studied statistics of compressible mhd turbulence for high , intermediate , and low @xmath0 plasmas and for different sonic and alfven mach numbers . for subalfvenic turbulence we provided the decomposition of turbulence into alfven , slow and fast modes .",
    "we have found that the coupling of compressible and incompressible modes is weak and , contrary to the common belief , the drain of energy from alfven to compressible modes is marginal along the cascade .",
    "for the cases studied , we have found that gs95 scaling is valid for _ alfven modes _ : @xmath186 _ slow modes _ also follows the gs95 model for both high @xmath0 and mildly supersonic low @xmath0 cases : @xmath187 for the highly supersonic low @xmath0 case , the kinetic energy spectrum of slow modes tends to be steeper , which may be related to the formation of shocks .",
    "+ _ fast mode _ spectra are compatible with acoustic turbulence scaling relations : @xmath188 our super - alfvenic turbulence simulations suggest that the picture above holds true at sufficiently small scales at which alfven speed @xmath53 is larger than the turbulent velocity @xmath16 .",
