    "in several areas of physics the scale - invariant systems are important .",
    "these systems have been recognized in the context of condensed matter @xcite and theories of modified gravity such as mond @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "of particular importance are the systems invariant under anisotropic scale - transformations of the space - time of the form @xmath1 where @xmath0 plays the role of a dynamical critical - exponent .",
    "these transformations arise in the non - relativistic limit of string theory @xcite and , through the duality @xmath2 , this theory can be related to condensed matter systems @xcite . recently , in addition , p.  hoava proposed a gravity compatible with ( [ eq : escala ] ) .",
    "this gravity is non - relativistic but at large distances retrieves a gravity similar to einstein s @xcite .",
    "a noteworthy fact of hoava gravity is that replaces the usual dispersion relation by @xmath3 but more importantly , for the case of @xmath4 , yields a ghost - free gravity which is renormalizable by power counting .",
    "this new gravity has features that makes it notable ; for instance , in a natural way has an alternative mechanism to inflation @xcite .",
    "in addition , it can explain some cosmological phenomena without introducing dark matter @xcite ; some systems in this gravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "another feature is that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : horava ] ) arises not from a geodesic equation but from a mechanics invariant under ( [ eq : escala ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "hoava gravity is recent and has several aspects not well understood ; for example , it presents some dynamical problems @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "a modification to hoava gravity , free from these problems , can be found in @xcite ; however see @xcite .",
    "from all this , hoava gravity is without a doubt an important step towards understanding the quantum aspects of gravity .",
    "+ field theories consistent with the dispersion relation ( [ eq : horava ] ) for the case of @xmath5 have been studied @xcite , some systems with @xmath4 can be seen in @xcite .",
    "systems with arbitrary @xmath0 have been studied in : black holes @xcite , nonrelativistic @xmath2 duality @xcite , and the causal structure of schrdinger space @xcite .",
    "however , the case of @xmath0 arbitrary has been seldom considered in field theory . in this paper ,",
    "based on the initial works @xcite and",
    "@xcite , we study an electrodynamics compatible with the transformations ( [ eq : escala ] ) for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "modified maxwell s equations and their conserved quantities are first obtained for the case of @xmath5 and then , based on these results , a general model that includes derivatives of higher order in the magnetic field is constructed . for this model",
    "we obtain a dispersion relation of the form @xmath6 and show that @xmath7 acts as a refraction index .",
    "notice that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : horava ] ) is a particular case of ( [ eq : horava - disper-0 ] ) .",
    "the conserved quantities are also obtained ; in particular it is shown that energy is modified , but the momentum and angular momentum remain unchanged .",
    "in addition , we show the existence of a conserved quantity additional to the usual ones . for this system",
    "we propose the modified maxwell s equations with sources and obtain their conservation laws .",
    "in particular , the modifications to the stress tensor are provided . moreover , from duality transformations we consider the problem of the magnetic monopole and show the existence of a dual electrodynamics compatible with the dispersion relation ( [ eq : horava - disper-0 ] ) .",
    "finally , we show that the propagator of this theory can be regarded as a quantum correction to the usual maxwell s propagator . + it is worth mentioning that non - relativistic maxwell theory has been already studied in another context @xcite",
    ". other models with higher derivatives in the magnetic fields can be found in @xcite . + this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sn : el - h - z-2 ] hoava electrodynamics for the case of @xmath5",
    "is studied ; in the section [ sn : el - h - z - gen ] we present the general case of arbitrary @xmath0 ; an analysis of the magnetic monopole question appears in section [ sn : dual ] ; we obtain the green function in section 5 ; finally our results are summarized in section [ sn : summ ] .",
    "in this section we study hoava electrodynamics for the case of @xmath5 originally proposed in @xcite . for completeness",
    "we recall the definitions @xmath8 now , let us assume we have the action @xmath9 by requesting @xmath10 one finds the equations of motion @xmath11 consideration of ( [ eq : def3 ] ) leads to the modified maxwell s equations @xmath12 from ( [ eq : m - h2 ] ) and ( [ eq : m - h4 ] ) we obtain @xmath13 then , the dispersion relation for plane waves is @xmath14 .",

    "this implies that the electric charge is modified by @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , for a point particle the electric charge changes from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . below we will find this phenomenon also present in the lorentz force .",

    "a similar modification occurs to the gravitational potential of a particle @xcite .",
    "+      note that equations ( [ eq : escala - ecuaciones1])-([eq : escala - ecuaciones2 ] ) are invariant under the scale transformations @xmath80 under these , the action transforms as @xmath81 therefore , only if @xmath43 the transformations ( [ eq : escalazgeneral ] ) are symmetries of the action . in this case , by noether s theorem , we have the conserved quantity @xmath82 which is the generator of dilations . for arbitrary @xmath0",
    "the transformations ( [ eq : escalazgeneral ] ) are not symmetries of the action , but it can be shown that the quantity @xmath83 where @xmath84 is conserved .",

    "the usual maxwell s equations in vacuum are invariant under the duality transformations @xmath85 introducing these into the modified maxwell s equations ( [ eq : m - general-1])-([eq : m - general-4 ] ) one finds the dual equations @xmath86 therefore , unlike the usual case , the equations are not self - dual .",
    "now one gets a system of modified maxwell s equations with the faraday s law modified .",
    "it can be observed that these equations imply the wave equations ( [ eq : onda-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : onda-2 ] ) , and so eqs .",
