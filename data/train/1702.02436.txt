    "during the last three decades , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin-1/2 heisenberg model and its generalizations have been investigated in great detail both analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "this is because these models are regarded as the relevant models for the 2d quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "furthermore , although the phase diagram of high temperature cuprate superconductors is not well understood , it is generally believed that these cuprate superconductors may be obtained by doping the quantum antiferromagnetic insulators with charge carriers . as a result ,",
    "research related to these models is still very active even today .",
    "in addition to the spin-1/2 heisenberg model , higher spin antiferromagnets , in particular the spin-1 heisenberg model , are of theoretical interest due to the fact that they are relevant in explaining experimental results of real materials as well @xcite .",
    "for example , ndmaz , nenp , and pbni@xmath8v@xmath8o@xmath9 are found to be spin-1 quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnets . besides the simplest type of these models which have spatially isotropic couplings , the spatially anisotropic heisenberg models are also studied thoroughly @xcite . in particular , these generalized models are frequently used as a route for studying quantum phase transitions . moreover , the spatially anisotropic models are important in understanding experimental data .",
    "two notable examples are the 2d spin-1/2 heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 refers to its value in the spatial @xmath10-direction . ] on the square and rectangular lattices as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum antiferromagnet with a ladder pattern of spatial anisotropy on a cubic lattice .",
    "the former is argued to be relevant to the newly discovered pinning effects of the electronic liquid crystal in the underdoped cuprate superconductor yba@xmath8cu@xmath11o@xmath12 @xcite , and the latter is considered to be the right model for explaining the phase diagram of tlcucl@xmath11 under pressure @xcite . to conclude , despite their simplicity ,",
    "the spatially anisotropic heisenberg models are among the most important and frequently studied systems in condensed matter physics .    among the spatially anisotropic heisenberg models with quantum spin , the one shown in fig .",
    "1 is particularly special . for this model",
    "one sees clearly that as the magnitude of the ratio of couplings @xmath5 decreases , the system will eventually become decoupled one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic chains ( this takes place when @xmath13 ) .",
    "one intriguing physics to explore for this spin-1/2 model is to examine whether a phase transition , between the antiferromagnetic and dimerized phases , occurs before one reaches the extreme case @xmath13 .",
    "analytic ( and some numerical ) evidence indicates that for the model of fig .  1 with quantum spin , the long - range antiferromagnetic order is destroyed only for infinitesimal @xmath5 @xcite . as a result , to study whether a phase transition appears at a particular value of @xmath14 using unbiased quantum monte carlo simulations is subtle . indeed , as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , square lattice is not the appropriate lattice geometry for studying this model and rectangular lattice should be used instead .",
    "furthermore , to capture the 2d characters of the model , the ratio of linear lattice sizes @xmath6 needs to be adjusted individually for each considered @xmath5 .",
    "even so , one must carry out careful investigation for the relevant observables so that the correct physics is obtained .",
    "for example , to make sure that the extrapolating results are reliable , for every @xmath5 several ratios of @xmath6 may be needed in the calculations .    for the spin-1/2 model depicted in fig .  1 , one proposed quantitative approach to study the 2d ground state properties for every considered @xmath5 is to adjust the corresponding ratio @xmath6 so that the spatial winding number squared in the 1- and 2-directions , namely @xmath15 and @xmath16 take the same values . with such a method the 2d characters of the model",
    "will not be lost and can be obtained unbiasedly .",
    "this idea and similar ones have been used to study the spin-1/2 model ( of fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite as well as quantum phase transitions of 2d dimerized quantum spin models @xcite .",
    "the motivation of our study presented here is to provide a more convincing numerical result to support the quantitative correctness of the method of requiring @xmath17 in the simulations . indeed , for the model in fig .  1 with quantum spin",
    ", monte carlo and series expansion results of the observable spin stiffness in the 1-direction agree with each other only for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "therefore it is desirable to carry out a more detailed investigation so that the validity of this method can be justified .",
    "notice it is known that the quantum phase transition associated with dimerization for the spin-1 model with the same spatial anisotropy takes place at a finite value of @xmath5 @xcite . hence simulating the spin-1 model with the same spatial anisotropy shown in fig .",
    "1 provides a great opportunity to further examine the validity of this method .",
    "indeed as we will demonstrate later , our monte carlo results of @xmath7 for the spin-1 model agree quantitatively with those determined by the series expansion method from @xmath19 down to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "consequently our investigation gives convincing evidence for the correctness of this method .",
    "notice the spatially anisotropic quantum heisenberg model of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] and its 1d limit are two completely different systems @xcite .",
    "therefore an unconventional behavior is likely to appear as one approaches the 1d limit from the 2d model .",
    "our study paves a way to investigate the novel phenomena of dimension crossover from a 2d system to its 1d limit .",
    "we would like to point out that even with the method of adjusting the aspect ratio @xmath6 in the calculations so that the two spatial winding numbers squared reach the same numbers , the determination of ground state bulk properties requires the simulations being conducted at very low temperatures .",
    "such zero temperature calculations are computationally demanding . therefore instead of performing the simulations at very low temperatures and using the conventional approach of fitting the data with polynomials of the relevant parameters , we carry out the calculations at finite temperatures and employ the relevant predictions from magnon chiral perturbation theory ( m@xmath21pt ) to extract the bulk properties of the considered model .",
    "later we will briefly argue that under certain circumstances , this approach seems to be more efficient than the conventional one .",
    "indeed , for each considered @xmath5 , a few tens of the corresponding data points can be described quantitatively by two equations with only three unknown parameters , and particularly , we are able to arrive at high precision results with moderate computing resources .",
    "finally , another remarkable finding in our investigation is that , the m@xmath21pt can also be used to examine unambiguously the presence of the long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this will be explained in more detail in the relevant section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , after the introduction , the spatially anisotropic spin-1 heisenberg model and the observables considered in this work are detailed .",
    "furthermore , the m@xmath21pt is briefly introduced and some of its predictions relevant to our study are also listed .",
    "we then present the data as well as the resulting numerical results based on these data .",
    "finally a section is devoted to conclude our investigation .",

    "notice both of these two observables can be expressed in quantities related to the clusters .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 is associated with the temporal winding number @xmath42 which is the sum of winding numbers @xmath43 of the loop - clusters @xmath44 around the euclidean time direction .",
    "similarly , the spatial winding numbers @xmath45 for @xmath46 are defined in the same manner . with the convention employed here ,",
    "the spin stiffness @xmath0 ( for @xmath19 ) can be obtained directly from the standard relation @xmath47 in the zero - temperature and infinite - volume limits .",
    "in addition , the temporal winding number squared @xmath48 calculated in this study is exactly the susceptibility @xmath21 and is related to @xmath39 by @xmath49 . finally the spinwave velocity @xmath2 can be estimated from these winding numbers squared by the method detailed in refs .",
