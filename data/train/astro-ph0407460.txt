    "old stellar populations , both old stars and star clusters , provide unique insight into the early assembly history of their parent galaxies . for example , in the milky way , ages , abundances , and kinematics of these two stellar populations portray a relatively quiescent early evolution , with no significant merging since the formation of the galactic thick disk @xmath8 gyr ago ( see e.g. , wyse 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "subpopulations of globular clusters ( gcs ) , as luminous tracers of mass , are found in the halo ( metal poor , little rotation ) , associated with the bulge ( metal rich , centrally concentrated ) , and also with the thick disk ( metal rich , rotationally supported ) ( e.g. , zinn 1985 ; armandroff 1989 ; minniti 1995 ; cote 1999 ) .",
    "old clusters in andromeda show both similarities to and differences with their galactic counterparts .",
    "the luminosity , metallicity , and size distributions of gcs in m31 and the milky way appear extremely similar ( e.g. , crampton et  al .",
    "1985 ; perrett et  al .   2002 ; barmby , holland , & huchra 2002 ) . however , recent kinematic studies suggest that a `` cold '' rotating thin disk of ancient gcs ( covering the entire range of metallicities ) exists in m31 , which implies that m31 could not have undergone any significant accretion events since the formation of these objects ( morrison et  al .",
    "any theory for the formation of andromeda will have to simultaneously explain this result for the gc system , and the recent discovery of intermediate age ( @xmath9 gyr ) , metal - rich stars ( from main sequence fitting ) in the halo of m31 ( brown et  al .",
    "a number of works in different portions of the m31 halo have established that the metallicity distribution of the field stars differs substantially from that of the gc distribution ( e.g. , durrell , harris , & pritchet 2001 ; reitzel & guhathakurta 2002 ) . with their additional age constraints , brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that a late merging event is the most likely scenario for the presence of these halo stars .",
    "m33 is the final and latest - type spiral galaxy in the local group .",
    "the early work of mould & kristian ( 1986 ) suggested that m33 halo stars have a very low mean metallicity , @xmath10  dex , with a small spread .",
    "however , more recent analysis of the same field indicates that this location is still dominated by ( metal - rich ) m33 disk stars , although there may be a very small contribution from a ( metal - poor ) stellar halo ( tiede , sarajedini , & barker 2004 ) .",
    "surprisingly , despite its low luminosity ( mass ) , m33 has a relatively large gc population , with the majority of these having halo kinematics ( christian & schommer 1988 ; schommer et  al .",
    "1991 ; chandar et  al .",
    "the m33 gc system appears quite different from those in the galaxy and m31 in at least three ways : _",
    "i ) _ there is evidence from horizontal branch morphology ( sarajedini et  al .",
    "1998 ) and spectroscopic line indices ( chandar et  al .   2002 ) that the halo clusters have a much larger age spread than those found in the galaxy and m31 ( although see larsen et  al .",
    "2002 for a different viewpoint ) ; _ ii ) _ the luminosity function of ancient m33 clusters appears to continue to rise beyond the @xmath2 cutoff seen in the galactic and m31 gc systems ; and _ iii ) _ the estimated total population of @xmath11 gcs ( chandar , bianchi , & ford 2001 ) gives this galaxy a higher mass normalized gc population ( @xmath12 ) than the two earlier - type spirals ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the milky way and m31 respectively ) in the local group .",
    "as one moves beyond the local group , it becomes much more difficult to access individual stars , and gcs become the ancient stellar population tracer of choice .",
    "however , ground based studies of late - type galaxies beyond the local group , even of galaxies at high inclination , have shown mixed results .",
    "contamination by foreground stars and background galaxies can be a major problem .",
    "for example , using follow - up spectroscopy , beasley & sharples ( 2000 ) confirmed only 14/64 and 1/55 gc candidates in ngc  253 and ngc  55 respectively .",
    "the depth and resolution of imaging possible with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) has transformed the field of extragalactic gc research over the last decade , and motivated significant progress in understanding the formation and evolution of gc systems , particularly in elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "one very interesting result is widespread evidence for bimodal color distributions in early - type galaxy gc systems over a large range of luminosity , indicative of multiple episodes of cluster formation even in lower mass ellipticals ( e.g. , kundu & whitmore 2001 ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ) . despite evidence that gcs exist in all massive galaxies , as well as in a number of lower mass systems ,",
    "our understanding of the formation of spiral galaxy gc systems remains much poorer than for early - type galaxies .",
    "a recent _ hst _ study of seven edge - on spirals ( out to the distance of virgo ) has made important progess in this direction .",
    "goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the gc systems of seven edge - on spirals , from sa to sc , using v and i band _ hst _ wfpc2 imaging .",
    "they find that the specific frequency ( @xmath5 ) of gcs in spirals with hubble types later than sb are all consistent with a value of @xmath15 , supporting the concept of a `` universal '' old halo population in later - type spirals . because a few earlier - type spirals are known to have larger specific frequencies than this value , goudfrooij et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that a second , metal rich `` bulge '' population in galaxies with large bulge / total ( b / t ) ratios could explain current observations of spiral gc systems .",
    "this fits into the forbes , brodie , & larsen ( 2001 ) scenario , where a `` universal '' metal - rich gc population forms in association with both spiral bulges and elliptical spheroids .",
    "one goal of this paper is to look for further evidence supporting or dismissing these concepts of `` universal '' halo and bulge gc systems .    in order to expand the number of spirals which have detailed gc system information , additional samples of these ancient objects",
    "are needed which can be followed up with ground based spectroscopy ( to measure ages , abundances , and velocities ) . due to the need for eventual spectroscopy , in this work we study spirals within 10 mpc .",
    "furthermore , because it appears that gcs may sometimes reside in thin disks , we restrict target selection to include galaxies with relatively low inclinations ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "one potential difficulty in studying ancient star clusters in late - type galaxies , is the fact that these systems usually have on - going cluster formation in the disk . in terms of numbers , clusters with ages younger than several gyr",
    "often completely overwhelm their older counterparts .",
    "for example , in m33 there are currently @xmath17 known ancient gcs , but several hundred known younger clusters ( e.g. , christian & schommer 1988 ; chandar , bianchi , & ford 1999a , 2001 ) . with access only to optical photometry , there are degeneracies in broadband colors among age , reddening , and metallicity , which can lead to significant contamination of an old cluster sample by reddened young clusters . however , with an appropriate filter combination , these degeneracies can be sorted out . in particular , the u bandpass in combination with redder filters provides crucial information to differentiate among ancient and ( reddened ) young objects .    in this work",
    "we attempt to broadly characterize gc systems in five nearby spirals : m81 , m83 , ngc  6946 , m101 , and m51 .",
    "these target galaxies were chosen because they are nearby , and they have multifilter hst wfpc2 imaging observations available ; in particular there is at least some u band information .",
    "we are interested in fundamental parameters , such as the total number of gcs in each galaxy , their specific frequencies , the luminosity and color distributions , and finally the size distribution of gcs .",
    "global properties of the target galaxies are given in table 1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : @xmath18 gives background information regarding the current status of our knowledge of the gc systems in the target galaxies .",
    "we explicitly describe the advantages of this work over previous studies ; @xmath19 describes the data and reduction ; @xmath20 presents luminosity , color , and size distributions , as well as gc specific frequencies ; and @xmath21 discusses the global properties of the gc systems , and their consistency within the framework of `` universal '' ancient cluster subsystems . in @xmath22 we summarize the main results of this work .",

    "sextractor performed well in our moderately crowded stellar fields .",
    "detection was run on the v band images ( either drizzled or combined ) for each field , since in all cases these were the deepest and/or had the best resolution .",

    "in addition to the output from sextractor , point spread function ( psf ) fitting was performed on each object , using the iraf task allstar ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the psf was created by automatically choosing bright , isolated stars using size , shape , and neighbor information .",
    "cluster candidates were selected to be more extended than the psf and have low ellipticity values .",

    "in general , these objects were typically young star clusters , since young massive clusters tend to be more numerous than ancient clusters in later type spirals .",
    "an average , empirical aperture correction was then obtained by measuring the mean magnitude differences in 5 and 3 pixel aperture radii . for m51",
    ", we find mean @xmath43 values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the pc and wf ccds respectively .",
    "these values were compared with table 1 of larsen & brodie ( 2000 ) , where they have tabulated aperture corrections based on synthetic king model profiles .",
    "we find that our values are slightly smaller than their king30 profiles ( concentration parameter 30 ) , for a synthetic cluster with a typical fwhm value of 1.0 pixels .",

    "( the description and results of cluster size measurements is presented in @xmath47 . )",
    "this gives further confidence in the empirically derived aperture corrections , since our smaller intrinsic cluster size would result in a smaller simulated aperture correction , bringing the two values into excellent agreement .",
    "because very few of the clusters in our m51 gc sample are isolated within a 30 pixel radius , we use table 1 in larsen & brodie ( 2000 ) to complete the aperture correction to an infinite radius for the wf ccds , and use 2 isolated sources in our pc images .",

    "below , we discuss the global luminosity and color distributions for the gc systems in our spiral sample .",
    "one of the most striking features in figures  [ cmd]a , b is that the globular clusters from different galaxies appear to separate in color space . the m51 cluster population has mean ( foreground reddening corrected ) @xmath59 and @xmath602 colors of 0.67 and 0.95 , with standard deviations of 0.14 and 0.17 respectively .",
    "comparable values for the m81 gc sample are 0.92 and 1.19 , with standard deviations of 0.15 and 0.18 .",
    "the mean @xmath602 color of the m51 gc system is remarkably similar to the blue ( metal - poor ) peak found in elliptical and lenticular galaxies ( e.g. , burgarella , kissler - patig , & buat 2001 ) , and the mean @xmath602 color of our m81 gc sample is remarkably similar to the red ( metal - rich ) peak in these early type galaxies .",
    "the m83 system has a mean @xmath602 color of 1.22 with a standard deviation of 0.23  similar to the metal - rich peak in early type galaxies , but with a large spread .",
    "note that this is primarily due to a number of clusters fainter than @xmath603 , which have predominantly red colors .    because colors are sensitive to metallicity in single stellar populations older than a few gyr , the gc color distributions seem to suggest that m51 has a nearly exclusive metal - poor gc population , despite being of a similar hubble type as the milky way , which is known to have formed @xmath604 gcs more metal rich than @xmath605}\\sim-1 $ ] ( see compilation in harris 1996 ) .",
    "the color distributions for m81 gcs however , are redder , suggesting the presence of metal - rich gcs ( although internal reddening would shift any affected cluster to bluer colors ) .",
    "the color distributions are explored further in the next two sections .    in figure  [ gclf ]",
    "we show the observed v band luminosity distributions for our globular cluster samples , uncorrected for completeness .",
    "the dashed lines represent average 80% completeness limits , as discussed in section 3.5.2 .",
    "note that these are not the completeness as a function of local background level , and that a single value for each galaxy can not capture the complicated issue of completeness . for m81 , the closest and earliest type spiral in our sample , we see a peak in the gc luminosity function more luminous than the completeness level .",
    "this is the characteristic shape and turnover seen in the milky way , m31 and most elliptical and lenticular gc systems .",
    "thus m81 gcs appear to have a shape similar to the now familiar `` universal '' gc luminosity function . while our m83 sample does not contain a large number of gcs ,",
    "the luminosity function for these objects is similar to that for m81 .",
    "m51 is the most distant galaxy in our sample , and does not have extremely deep exposures .",
    "therefore the completeness limit for this galaxy does not quite reach the turnover in the gc luminosity function ( which is expected to occur near @xmath606 ) .",
    "the apparent peak in the cluster luminosity distribution around @xmath607 , is likely caused by one or two effects : 1 ) variable completeness limits as a function of background level , or 2 ) possible contamination from reddened young clusters , and is likely not real .",
    "the situation in m101 appears to be quite different from that in m81 . while the number of clusters is few , and based primarily on a single _ hst _ wfpc2 pointing located near the center ,",
    "our deep drizzled observations reveal a population of faint , red clusters , which appear to have a powerlaw luminosity distribution down to our completeness limit ( @xmath608 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that all of these objects are _ resolved _ , so can not be individual stars .",
    "the colors for these faint objects are indistinguishable from the more luminous clusters in our sample ( although due to their faintness , the u band photometry has higher uncertainty ) .",
    "the nature of these faint , red clusters is discussed further in @xmath609 .",
    "although the gc catalog for ngc  6946 contains relatively few objects , we note that the luminosity distribution appears more similar to that for m101 gcs rather than m81 gcs , due to the apparent `` excess '' of clusters beyond the expected turnover of @xmath2 .",
    "low number statistics may play a role in the observed luminosity distributions for m101 and ngc  6946 .",
    "we quantified this effect by performing a simple experiment . a parent gaussian distribution with a peak at @xmath610 and a width , @xmath611 ( mimicking fits to the galactic gc system distribution ) was assumed .",
    "we imposed a cutoff of @xmath612 , roughly the 50% completeness limit for ngc  6946 , according to figure  3 .",
    "this truncated gaussian was then randomly sampled 19 times , and the resulting distribution of luminosities displayed in a histogram , similar to those shown in figure  5 .",
    "we find that roughly @xmath613 of the time , a distribution somewhat similar to the gclf for ngc  6946 results , and @xmath614 of the time the distribution has more clusters near the peak magnitude .",
    "repeating this experiment using a collection of 29 clusters and comparing with the distribution plotted for m101 , a similar distribution with excess faint clusters resulted only @xmath615% of the time .",
    "therefore , there is a @xmath616% probability that the m101 gc luminosity function differs substantially from that observed in the milky way and a number of other galaxies .",
    "the metallicity distributions of gc systems shed light on the formation history of the parent galaxy . for the gc systems in elliptical galaxies , widespread bimodality in the color ( and by extension metallicity ) distributions , has helped constrain the most likely formation scenarios for early - type galaxies ( e.g. , kundu & whitmore 2001 ) . however , less is known concerning the metallicity distributions of gc systems in spirals .",
    "the two best studied spirals , the galaxy and m31 , both have bimodal gc metallicity distributions ( e.g. , cote 1999 ; perrett et  al .   2002 ) .    in figure  [ 2colmetal1 ] , we plot the cluster @xmath602 vs. @xmath32 color - color distributions .",
    "the gc candidates have been dereddened by foreground @xmath68 only .",
    "these are compared with three different metallicity stellar evolutionary bc00 models : solar ( solid line ) , 1/5 solar ( dotted line ) and 1/50 solar ( dashed line ) ; clearly more metal - rich models have redder colors for ancient populations .",
    "for comparison , we also plot the colors of galactic gcs ( harris 1996 ) and @xmath617 m31 gcs ( with ubvi photometry ) presented in barmby et al .",
    "these have been corrected for both foreground and internal extinction ( p.",
    "barmby kindly made the derived @xmath68 values for m31 gcs available to us ) , for clusters where the @xmath68 derivation is robust , and by only the foreground value when it is not .",
    "we note that there is some scatter in the m31 gc colors , most notably from a handful of blue objects .",
    "these are likely young , massive clusters found in the disk of the andromeda galaxy , as spectroscopically confirmed by barmby et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "blue galactic gc colors agree well with the models , while the redder ones appear to have colors which are offset ( blueward ) from the high metallicity model predictions of bc00 .",
    "the dereddened m31 gc colors agree well with their milky way counterparts .",
    "the m81 gcs presented here however , appear to lie along a different locus than both milky way and m31 gcs .",
    "potentially , this is due to internal reddening , which we have not corrected for .",
    "we find that if m31 gc colors are only corrected for foreground reddening , they lie in the same region as the m81 gcs , indicating that internal reddening is a plausible explanation for the offset . a second factor supporting the possibility that differential reddening is responsible for the offset between m81 and dereddened m31 gc colors is the location of our m81 fields , which are scattered mostly along the spiral arms and disk .",
    "m51 and m101 clusters follow the intrinsic galactic and m31 gc color - color locus more closely .",
    "we attempt to use the color - color distributions to study the underlying metallicity distribution in spiral gc systems in two ways .",
    "first , because the intrinsic colors of galactic and m31 gcs are in good agreement , we assume that these provide a fiducial for the clusters studied in this work .",
    "figure  [ 2colmetal1]a shows a linear fit to intrinsic m31 gc colors in @xmath602 vs. @xmath32 color - color space [ equation : @xmath32 = @xmath618 - 2.9 ] .",
    "we assume that deviations from this line are due to internal reddening for the gcs presented in this work , and track them along the reddening vector until they intersect the best fit line , assuming the @xmath619 extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "we note that barmby et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) found little difference in the extinction law between galactic gcs and their m31 counterparts , and we assume the galactic extinction law is also similar for the galaxies studied in this work .",
    "once we dereddened m81 , m101 , and m51 gcs , we determined the position of each point along the best fit line ; hereafter we refer to this value as the `` two color index '' .",
    "the dereddened measurements in color - color space of _ ancient _ star clusters should reflect the underlying metallicity distribution .",
    "histograms of the two color indices for each galaxy sample are shown below the color - color diagram .",
    "a second possibility is that the m81 gcs in our spiral sample have different intrinsic colors than those in the galaxy and m31 . to explore this possibility",
    ", we fit the locus of the m81 gcs in figure  [ 2colmetal1]b .",
    "we then determined the two color index for each object by finding the location of the perpendicular bisector for each cluster .",
    "the resulting histograms for galactic , m31 , m81 , m101 , and m51 gcs are shown in the lower panel of figure  [ 2colmetal1]b .    in figures  [ 2colmetal2]a , b we show two other color - color combinations . in figure",
    "[ 2colmetal2]a , which includes most of the clusters in our sample , we see that four m51 gcs ( about 12% ) are located in the red gc parameter space , while the rest are consistent with bluer gc colors .",
    "this represents an upper limit to the total number of metal - rich gcs in our m51 sample ( since any intrinsic reddening would move these objects to bluer colors ) .",

    "the intrinsic metallicity distributions for m31 and galactic gcs are known to be bimodal .",
    "this translates into an extended color distribution in the lower panels of figures  [ 2colmetal1 ] and [ 2colmetal2 ] , including both metal - poor ( blue ) and metal - rich ( red ) gcs . in our cluster samples",
    ", low numbers also compromise our ability to clearly detect bimodality ; because of these small numbers , in general we will refer to `` extended '' metallicity distributions rather than bimodal distributions .",
    "one way to understand the underlying metallicity distribution from colors is to compare statistics between systems in different galaxies . in table  8",
    ", we compile the mean and standard deviation for gc two color indices .",
    "these only include clusters with u band photometry , since we are interested in the intrinsic color distributions .",
    "we find that the mean and @xmath620 of the m81 gc system ( 0.33 and 0.27 respectively ) are very similar to those for m31 ( 0.38 and 0.22 ) and the milky way ( 0.38 and 0.19 ) .",
    "m51 has a significantly lower mean value ( 0.17 ) and smaller spread ( 0.18 ) than the other three galaxies .",
    "assuming that the m51 clusters studied here are ancient , this is indicative of lower overall metallicity for the m51 gc system .",
    "although it is possible that the m51 gc candidates are younger and therefore more metal - rich , a comparison with stellar evolutionary models indicates that they would have to be substantially younger than 12  gyr for this to be true .",
    "for example , in the @xmath621 versus @xmath622 color - color diagram shown in figure  [ 2colmetal1]a , the m51 globular candidates are consistent with the blue , metal - poor m31 and milky way gc colors .",
    "if these were metal - rich the only way for them to intersect the solar metallicity model ( for example ) , would be if the reddening was high ( with @xmath623 ) , and the age around @xmath624 years .",
    "we consider this possibility unlikely , since the @xmath68 distribution for the entire m51 cluster system , including the youngest objects , is highly peaked at a reddening value much lower than this .",
    "the ancient clusters in m101 might be expected to be exclusively blue and metal - poor , since the extremely small bulge in this galaxy makes it unlikely that a metal - rich population associated with this component formed .",
    "although based on small number statistics , the intrinsic colors of m101 gc candidates appear more similar to those in m81 than in m51 ( mean and @xmath620 of 0.31 and 0.25 respectively ) , consistent with an interpretation that both metal - rich and metal - poor clusters formed in m101 .",
    "a formal test for bimodality is traditionally performed on the color distributions of elliptical gc systems ( e.g. , ashman , bird , & zepf 1994 ) to better understand their formation histories . for spiral gc systems ,",
    "the complication of variable reddening makes it more difficult to assess the underlying metallicity distribution based only on integrated colors . when using individual colors to test for bimodality in the m31 gc system , barmby et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that only two optical colors , @xmath625 and @xmath626 showed evidence for bimodality at the 95% confidence level .",
    "they found that photometric errors are likely large enough to mask any color separation in most single color distributions for gcs in andromeda and the galaxy .",
    "previously , we found no evidence for bimodality in the @xmath59 , @xmath627 , or @xmath602 color distributions of m81 gcs ( chandar , tsvetanov , & ford 2001 ) . rather than repeating the test for bimodality on single color distributions , here we use our two color statistic to probe underlying metallicity distributions .",
    "we restrict our samples to objects which have u band photometry , since this filter is crucial according to the barmby et  al .   2000 results , and also allows us to determine intrinsic ( dereddened ) cluster colors .",
    "first , we tested the color - color distributions of m31 gcs using the kmm algorithm ( mclachlan & basford 1988 ; ashman et  al .",
    "1994 ) . as input to the kmm algorithm",
    ", we used the two color index values ( as derived in the previous section ) , an initial mean and dispersion for the two gaussian groups to be fit ( the final solution is not very sensitive to these starting points unless there are many outliers ) , and the relative proportion of objects in each group .",
    "the p - value returned by kmm for a given distribution measures the statistical significance of the improvement in the fit when going from a single gaussian to ( in this case ) two gaussians . for m31 and the milky way , the hypothesis of a unimodal distribution in our @xmath621 vs. @xmath622 two color index space was rejected at the @xmath628% confidence level .",
    "similarly , when we tested the m81 distributions including u band photometry , a unimodal distribution is rejected at the @xmath629% confidence level , although a minimum of 50 data points should be used to obtain a reliable result .",
    "peaks near values of 0.20 and 0.45 were found by the kmm algorithm for the milky way and m31 gc systems .",
    "if we estimate the relative fraction of metal - poor to metal - rich gcs in our m81 sample by making a simple cut at a two color index of 0.325 , we find that roughly 60% of the m81 gcs with ubvi photometry are consistent with their metal - poor galactic and m31 counterparts .",
    "however , we caution that the location of the archival fields in m81 bias our sample against metal - rich bulge globulars .    in conclusion , we find that the dereddened color distributions of m81 and m101 gcs are consistent with an interpretation of an extended metallicity distribution similar to that found in the milky way and m31 gc systems , whereas in m51 most ancient clusters appear to be metal - poor .      the structures of gcs yield information concerning their formation and the environmental influence of the host galaxy .",
    "there is some evidence for differences in the mean structural properties of clusters between galaxies .",
    "for example , gcs in the lmc are more flattened on average than their counterparts in the milky way ( e.g. , geisler & hodge ; frenk & fall 1982 ) .",
    "much more evidence points to a size difference between red , metal - rich and blue , metal - poor gc subpopulations _ within _ galaxies , with red clusters being systematically more compact ( for results in early - type galaxies , see e.g. , kundu & whitmore 1998 ; in andromeda , see barmby , holland , & huchra 2002 ) .",
    "intrinsic sizes for gcs were measured ( from v band images ) using the ishape routine .",
    "a detailed description of the code is given in larsen ( 1999 ) , along with the results of extensive performance testing .",
    "essentially , ishape measures intrinsic object sizes by adopting an analytic model of the source and convolving this model with a ( user - supplied ) psf , and then adjusting the shape parameters until the best match is obtained .",
    "king model profiles with concentration parameters of @xmath630 were convolved with a psf , and fit individually to each object .",
    "ishape estimates the fwhm of each cluster ( in pixels ) , which was then converted to the half - light ( effective ) , @xmath3 , by multiplying the fwhm by a factor of 1.48 , as described in the ishape manual .    to measure cluster sizes in galaxies beyond the local group , it is important to have a good characterization of the psf .",
    "we selected m51 ( the most distant galaxy in our sample , and thus the most likely to present difficulties in measuring sizes ) to test two different techniques : 1 ) using hand - selected , relatively isolated stars , and 2 ) a theoretical psf created from the tinytim routine ( krist 1995 ) .",
    "we found that the size estimates from ishape using these two psfs differed by less than 20% .",
    "final size measurements for m81 , m83 , ngc  6946 , and m51 were made using a tinytim psf , since this is easily reproducible .",
    "one psf was generated for the pc ccd , and one for the wf ccds .",
    "sizes measured independently for eight m81 clusters located in overlapping _ hst _",
    "images agreed to better than 10% .",
    "because these objects are located in different portions of ccds in the two observations , the level of agreement indicates that using a single psf for each ccd is sufficient .",
    "however , we caution that focusing issues , and distortions could cause the intrinsic psf to be slightly broader for clusters located near the edge of a ccd .",
    "for m101 we implemented a different procedure , since our images were drizzled together .",
    "details of our measurement technique and testing will be presented in an upcoming paper ( converse , chandar , & whitmore 2004 , in prep ) .",
    "briefly , we created a tinytim psf at the original location of each m101 cluster , and then drizzled this psf by itself exactly as was done for the data .",
    "a comparison of bright clusters with sizes measured from both drizzled and non - drizzled m101 images showed excellent agreement .",
    "one very interesting result concerning the size distribution of star cluster systems is the example of ngc  1023 .",
    "larsen & brodie ( 2000 ) found an excess of faint clusters in this lenticular galaxy , relative to the expected turnover in the luminosity distribution .",
    "these faint , ancient clusters differ in ( at least three ways ) from their more luminous counterparts : _",
    "i ) _ they are more diffuse , _",
    "ii ) _ they are more metal rich on average , and _",
    "iii ) _ they appear to have disk - like kinematics , with a strong rotation signature ( brodie & larsen 2002 ) .",
    "when ngc  1023 clusters are separated by size at @xmath631  pc , the luminosity function for the compact clusters has a turnover near @xmath632 , while the excess faint clusters continue in power - law fashion to the detection limit .",
    "figure  [ size ] shows effective radii for ancient cluster candidates in all five galaxies as a function of luminosity and color . for comparison , we have added the half - mass radii of the galactic gc system ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "the dashed line marks an effective radius of 7 pc . in the galaxy only @xmath633% of gcs",
    "are more extended than 7 pc .",
    "our gc samples have extended cluster fractions range from 10% ( m83 ) to 59% ( m51 ) .",
    "formally , a kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) test finds that the size distributions in the milky way and m51 gc systems differ at a confidence level @xmath634% .",
    "the results for the other cluster systems are less conclusive , but show a much higher probability ( up to 85% ) that they are drawn from the same parent distribution as the milky way gcs .    in the previous section",
    ", we reported the detection of a number of faint ancient cluster candidates in m101 and ngc  6946 .",
    "these have a similar _ luminosity _ distribution to their faint counterparts in ngc  1023 . however , the _ size _ distributions for the faint m101 and ngc  6946 clusters discovered in this work are similar to those of the more luminous gcs in their respective parent galaxies .",
    "could the observed difference of the m51 gc system simply be due to observational bias ?",
    "the _ hst _ imaging is sufficient to select compact clusters in m51 .",
    "in fact our catalog of young m51 clusters has a large fraction of compact objects ( with @xmath635  pc ) .",
    "finally , we note that the ancient cluster candidates in m51 are almost exclusively blue , while those in m81 are preferentially red .",
    "although the physical reason for this difference is nt clear , these results are broadly consistent with previous observations of a size - metallicity trend , since the m51 gcs appear significantly bluer ( and more diffuse ) than their redder , more compact m81 counterparts .",
    "our final globular cluster samples include 47 , 21 , 19 , 29 , and 34 objects for m81 , m83 , ngc  6946 , m101 , and m51 respectively . given the very low fractional contamination estimated in @xmath636 , our survey provides unambiguous evidence that globular cluster systems exist in each of our target galaxies , despite the fact that m101 , m83 , and ngc  6946 are all of hubble type sc or later . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to determine the total number of gcs associated with each host galaxy .",
    "we use the following basic recipe :    * we assume that the gc luminosity function turnover occurs at @xmath610 . the total number of gcs is defined as twice the number of gcs brighter than the turnover magnitude of the gclf , where the gclf is assumed to be a gaussian ( in magnitude units ) . * the results of the artificial cluster experiments described in @xmath42 are used to estimate the completeness of our gc samples .",
    "we determined an incompleteness fraction for each gc based on its v band luminosity .",
    "each bin in the luminosity function was divided by the average completeness fraction of all objects in that bin to produce a completeness corrected value .",
    "because we do nt track local background levels for the clusters , our completeness corrections are `` averaged '' over a range of environments , which we assume to be representative for the entire gc population .",
    "* we then sum up the number of ( completeness corrected ) globular clusters to the expected turnover , and multiply this value by a factor of 2 , to account for the faint half of the distribution .",
    "* finally , we correct for the ( limited ) spatial coverage of the galaxy in our survey . our technique for estimating the correction or scale factor for the galaxies studied in this work is described below .",
    "note however , that our technique to correct for this should not be considered a replacement for imaging data which has broader coverage .    for spirals , two techniques",
    "have generally been used to make a correction for limited galaxy coverage .",
    "larsen et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) constructed radial distribution functions of gcs .",
    "the caveat to this technique is that it requires a large population of gcs to avoid complications resulting from small number statistics .",
    "kissler - patig et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and goudfrooij et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) correct for spatial coverage by making a direct comparison with the gc locations in the milky way .",
    "this technique makes the implicit assumption that gc systems in external spirals have a similar spatial distribution as the gc system in our galaxy .",
    "goudfrooij et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that the total number of gcs estimated for ngc  4594 using both methods described above gives consistent results .",
    "the estimated gc population in ngc  7814 is also similar between the two techniques ( goudfrooij et al .",
    "estimate @xmath637 total gcs using the galaxy - comparison technique , and rhode & zepf ( 2003 ) find @xmath638 gcs by fitting the radial profile of the gc system ) .",
    "because we do not have sufficient numbers of clusters or radial coverage to use the former technique , we devised a procedure similar to the latter .",
    "we use data from the milky way gc system compiled in the mcmaster catalog ( harris 1996 ) , which contains 150 gcs .",
    "however , we adopt @xmath639 ( van den bergh 1999 ) as the total number of galactic gcs .",
    "the undetected mw gcs are assumed to lie behind the galactic bulge , and the locations of these `` missing '' clusters was synthesized by reflecting 10 known clusters within 2.0 kpc of the bulge in the projected `` y - z '' plane . in the following discussion of galactic gc locations , x points toward the galactic center , y points in the direction of galactic rotation , and z toward the north galactic pole .",
    "there are essentially two different orientations which can be considered for external galaxies viewed face - on , corresponding to clusters with @xmath640 or @xmath24 z locations ( which side of the disk is observed ) .",
    "we created a mask defined by our spatial coverage of each galaxy , and then applied this mask to both face - on presentations of the milky way ( i.e. , the @xmath641 locations projected onto the x - y plane of the galactic disk ) . by calculating the fraction of the total gc system observable in each mask",
    ", we were able to determine a `` scale factor '' for the incomplete spatial coverage of our observations ( taken to be the average from the two orientations ) : @xmath642 , where @xmath643 is the number of gcs detected in the mask , and @xmath644 is the total number of gcs in the milky way system .",
    "this technique makes the explicit assumption that gcs are found predominantly associated with bulges and/or halos of galaxies .",
    "if instead globular clusters in a given galaxy are associated with a thin disk , and can be seen above the dust layer from either side , then our technique will overestimate the number of clusters .",
    "our technique to derive the total number of gcs can be written as :    @xmath645    where @xmath646 is the scale factor used to correct for the limited spatial coverage of the observations , the luminosity fuction is summed from the brightest magnitude bin @xmath647 to the magnitude bin covering the gclf turnover ; @xmath648 represents the average fractional completeness for gcs in a given luminosity bin , and @xmath649 is the number of clusters observed in a given luminosity bin .    as discussed in @xmath650 , m101 and ngc  6946 do not appear to have a typical log normal gc luminosity distribution in magnitude space . the observations probe these galaxies deeply enough that we can push @xmath651 magnitudes beyond the expected turnover in the gc luminosity function . having done this , we find an excess of faint , red , resolved clusters , a population which clearly does not exist in m81 .",
    "whether these objects are true ancient gcs formed early in the universe , or whether they have ages of a few billion years remains to be determined .",
    "for the purposes of discussing the total number of gcs in the three latest - type galaxies , we simply sum up the ( completess corrected ) clusters to the expected turnover ( @xmath652 ) , and follow equation 1 , thus _ explicitly excluding _ this `` excess '' faint population . in m101 and m83",
    "if we sum up the ( completeness corrected ) gc sample to @xmath612 , the total number of clusters increases by a factor @xmath653 . because of m81 s proximity",
    ", we can reach almost the entire expected gc population .",
    "for this galaxy , we tried two approaches . first , we used the bright half of the gc luminosity function as representative of the faint portion , and second we summed the entire completeness corrected cluster population .",
    "both techniques result in similar total gc populations for m81 ( 430 vs. 450 ) , and we retain the numbers based on the second method .",
    "uncertainties in the total number of gcs are dominated by the correction for limited coverage .",
    "the distribution of galactic gcs becomes stochastic as one moves away from the galaxy center , since they are not evenly projected in the x - y plane at larger galactocentric distances .",
    "we attempted to place limits on the upper and lower fractional coverage by considering the full range of clusters covered if a given outer wfpc2 pointing was located at the same physical distance from the galaxy center , but at a different location .",
    "additionally , uncertainties in the total number of clusters based on the unavailability of the @xmath52 filter for some fields were considered .",
    "the range in fractional coverage and likely contamination fraction were translated into uncertainties in the total number of gcs derived for each galaxy .",
    "the calculated total gc numbers residing in each target galaxy and associated uncertainties are recorded in column 6 of table  9 .",
    "previously , we estimated the m81 gc population to be @xmath654 ( chandar , tsvetanov , & ford 2001 ) .",
    "there were two weaknesses in our previous technique : 1 ) we did nt explicitly make completeness corrections , and 2 ) our measurements hinged on fitting the radial profile of the gc system , which has very large uncertainties .",

    "the specific frequency , @xmath5 ( as defined by harris & van den bergh 1981 ) @xmath683 , is the number of gcs normalized by the total galaxy luminosity .",

    "note however , that the u band photometric uncertainties are quite large for many of these .",
    "the presence of faint , ancient clusters has a significant influence on the observed luminosity distribution for our gc candidates ; rather than turning over as expected , the clusters apparently follow a powerlaw distribution to the detection limit .",

    "qualitatively , the luminosity distribution of the faint gc candidates is similar to that found by larsen & brodie ( 2000 ) for faint , red , extended clusters in ngc  1023 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy has established that the `` faint fuzzies '' in ngc  1023 rotate with the disk , unlike the more luminous , compact gcs , which have kinematics expected for halo / bulge objects .",
    "these faint diffuse clusters are ancient ( @xmath686 gyr ) , and relatively metal rich ( brodie & larsen 2002 ) .",
    "the faint m101 and ngc  6946 objects differ from `` faint fuzzies '' in that they are compact ( @xmath47 ) , with sizes indistinguishable from the more luminous gc candidates in m101 , and they are not preferentially red ( metal - rich ) .",
    "what is the nature of these faint clusters ?",
    "are they truly ancient , low mass clusters as suggested by their luminosities and colors ?",
    "because they are resolved , they can not be individual stars , and their round morphology and location in the inner portions of the host galaxy ( where almost no background galaxies are seen ) is incompatible with a population of background galaxies .",
    "are these analagous to the old open clusters in the milky way ; ancient ( @xmath687 gyr ) , less massive ( few @xmath688 ) clusters residing in the ( thin ) galactic disk ? in figure  [ faintcl ] we plot the color magnitude ( upper panels ) and color - color diagrams ( lower panels ) of old ( @xmath689 log yrs ) open galactic clusters with available integrated photometry ( lata et al .",

    "figure  [ faintcl ] illustrates two points .",
    "first , the old open clusters in the galaxy appear fainter than the objects discovered in m101 . however , current surveys of disk clusters are probably very incomplete due to large extinction in the disk .",
    "thus it is likely that additional old open clusters exist , and these could overlap in luminosity with the objects presented here .",
    "the faint m101 clusters are defined so they lie in a luminosity range where galactic gcs are falling off , and observational detection limits prevent us from observing old clusters as faint as known galactic old open clusters .",
    "however , we can not rule out that deeper photometry might reveal populations which overlap with old open cluster luminosities .",
    "the second point is that there is significant overlap in the colors of gcs and old open clusters ( which are many gyr younger ) .",
    "partially , this is due to the age - metallicity degeneracy , since the somewhat more metal rich open clusters have slightly redder colors for their age than do the more metal - poor , older gcs .",
    "m101 cluster colors are consistent with formal age estimates @xmath690  gyr based on comparison with sub - solar bc00 models .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy is needed to establish whether faint m101 and ngc  6946 clusters are younger than their more luminous counterparts and whether they reside in a disk .    while we can not rule out that the faint m101/ngc  6946 clusters are counterparts to old galactic _ disk _ clusters , a second possibility is that the faint red clusters are the low mass extension of the initial _ halo _ gc population , which were somehow able to survive internal and external dynamical evolution for a hubble time . to explore this possibility",
    ", we compared available velocities for gcs in m33 fainter than @xmath656 , with their more luminous counterparts .",
    "although there are only 17 such faint m33 gcs with available velocities , these have ( halo ) kinematics indistinguishable from more luminous m33 gcs ( velocities taken from chandar et  al .",
    "2002 ) . therefore in m33",
    ", regardless of the exact origin of ancient halo clusters , it appears that a larger fraction of lower massive clusters have been able to survive destruction over a hubble time than found in the milky way or m31 .",
    "the fact that these excess faint anceint clusters have only been seen in the latest - type spirals , where potentially the dynamical conditions are different from those in other well studied but earlier type galaxies , may provide clues to their survival .",
    "goudfrooij et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied edge - on spiral galaxies of different hubble types .",
    "based on their result that spirals with @xmath691 ( i.e. hubble type later than sb ) have very similar gc specific frequencies ( @xmath692 ) , they suggest that this population represents a `` universal '' , old halo population which is present around each galaxy .",
    "rhode & zepf ( 2003 ) found a similar mass - normalized total number of metal - poor ( presumably halo ) gcs in the sab spiral ngc  7814 , as well as in the modest luminosity elliptical galaxy ngc  3379 .",
    "this is an important concept to test , considering the variety observed among the four most massive local group galaxies .",
    "while m33 has mostly halo gcs , in the lmc all ancient clusters reside in the ( thin ) disk ( freeman , illingworth , & oemler 1983 ) .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether _ all _ disk galaxies form halo systems of ancient clusters . in columns 7 and 8 of table  9",
    "we have compiled the estimated @xmath5 and t values for the galaxies presented in this work .",
    "we find that for all sample galaxies of type later than sb ( this only excludes m81 , the earliest and most bulge dominated galaxy in our sample ) , the @xmath5 and t values are very similar , around 0.5 and @xmath693 respectively .",
    "note that for m101 and ngc  6946 , we have disregarded the population of faint , red clusters in deriving the estimated total numbers of gcs in these host galaxies . in m81 ,",
    "the observed @xmath694% blue fraction in our sample is similar to that found in the milky way and m31 gc systems .",
    "this results in @xmath695 and @xmath696 , in the same range as we find for the later type spirals in our sample .",
    "we conclude that all galaxies studied in this work , both early- and late- type , support the concept that ( massive ) spirals have formed a similar number of mass - normalized total gcs , with @xmath697 and @xmath698 .",
    "since later - type galaxies are dominated in mass by their halos , this suggests that a `` universal '' population of halo gcs may have formed associated with all ( massive ) galaxies .",
    "this statement is predicated on the assumption that if the faint ( low mass ) clusters discovered in our sc and later - type galaxies belong to the original halo gc population , their presence is the result of a difference in _ destruction _",

    "( 2001 ) scenario .",
    "figures  [ 2colmetal2]a shows that there are four gcs in our m51 sample which appear to be metal - rich .",
