    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) might be viewed as _ non - diagonal _ overlap of wave functions .",
    "this offers the opportunity to study the partonic content of the nucleon from a new perspective .",
    "they are accessible in deeply virtual leptoproduction of photon and mesons , where the amplitude factorizes at leading twist - two accuracy in a perturbatively calculable hard - scattering part and the gpd . deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , a subprocess in the leptoproduction of a photon , is considered as a theoretically clean process .",
    "one of the main reasons to measure these processes is the quest for an understanding of the decomposition of the nucleon spin in quark and gluon angular momenta @xcite : @xmath1 the partonic angular momenta are given by the expectation values of the corresponding gauge invariant parts of the energy momentum tensor and might be further decomposed in spin and orbital angular momenta .",
    "they are also expressed by moments of gpds @xmath2 and @xmath0 , @xmath3 , \\quad \\left\\ { { a^q \\atop b^q}\\right\\}(\\mu^2 ) = \\lim_{\\delta\\to0 } \\int_{-1}^{1}\\ !",

    "the quantities @xmath6 are nothing but the averaged momentum fractions of unpolarized partons they are already phenomenologically constrained by deeply inelastic scattering measurements .",
    "momentum conservation guarantees that @xmath7 is normalized to one and the angular momentum sum rule ( sr ) ( [ sr - am ] ) implies then that the anomalous gravitomagnetic nucleon moment @xmath8 vanishes : @xmath9",
    "let us first recall the arguments that provide an estimate for the valence quark momentum fractions ( [ def - mom ] ) .",
    "the small @xmath10 behavior of valence pdfs is governed by the intercept @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 regge trajectories , while large @xmath10 counting rules state a @xmath14 behavior .",
    "taking also into account the large @xmath10 ratio @xmath15 , the resulting averaged momentum fractions , @xmath16 are in good agreement with phenomenological findings at a scale @xmath17 .    to estimate the quark angular momenta",
    ", we use isospin symmetry to fix the normalization of @xmath18 in terms of the nucleon magnetic moments .",
    "the relevant regge intercepts are the same as before and counting rules state now a @xmath19 behavior @xcite .",
    "the estimates for the anomalous gravitomagnetic moments and angular momenta follow from eq .",
    "( [ def - mom ] ) : @xmath20 hence , the valence part of the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment is expected to be small , i.e. , @xmath21 , and the ` unknown ' in the spin sr is the sea ( or gluon ) contribution .",
    "it was conjectured that @xmath22 is zero @xcite and so we would expect that @xmath23 nearly vanishes .",
    "in such a scenario the angular momentum @xmath24 is essentially expressed by the momentum fraction and changes only slightly under evolution . in a covariant two flavor quark model ( @xmath25 ) one",
    "has @xmath26 , usually within a relatively small value of @xmath23 . in the chiral quark soliton model ( @xmath27qsm )",
    "the role of sea quarks is more pronounced and estimates are compatible with our valence like ones @xcite .",
    "lattice measurements are consistent with the estimates ( [ est - agm ] ) , too . however , because of systematical errors , including neglecting gluon induced contributions ( disconnected diagrams ) , we consider @xmath23 as unmeasured . on the other hand",
    "the sr estimate @xcite states that at least half of the nucleon spin originates from gluons , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath23 is negative . we expect that @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "it is phenomenologically challenging to reveal the anomalous gravitomagnetic moments .",
    "so far this has been attempted in a model dependent way , where the gpd @xmath31 is specifically parameterized in terms of @xmath32 within a non - reggeized ` vector - meson exchange ' contribution .",
    "this flexibility is incompatible with @xmath27qsm results @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one might utilize ` common ' gpd models with @xmath23 as a free parameter .",
    "the dvcs amplitude is parameterized by compton form factors ( cffs ) . to leading order ( lo ) accuracy",
    "their imaginary parts are given by gpds at the _ cross - over trajectory _",
    "@xmath33 : @xmath34 this relation is analogous to the well - known parton interpretation of dis structure functions , given as linear combination of pdfs .",
    "a fixed @xmath5 dispersion relation allows to evaluate the real part of the cff from its imaginary part .",
    "hence , to lo accuracy it is expressed by the gpd on the cross - over trajectory and a subtraction constant ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 the scale dependence of a cff is governed by the gpd in the outer region ( @xmath37 ) and that radiative corrections extend eq .",
    "( [ invrel ] ) to a convolution integral over the outer region .",
    "the cffs can be evaluated without knowing the gpds in the central region . combining operator product expansion and",
    "dispersion relation shows that the gpd in this region arises from the lorentz covariant decomposition of the cffs in terms of operator matrix elements @xcite .",
    "this can be also derived from a integral equation @xcite , denoted as _ gpd sr family _ :",

    "they allow us to construct the gpd in the central region from its knowledge in the outer region and the subtraction constant .",
    "we note that the subtraction constant is entirely related to the so - called @xmath39-term and only contributes to the @xmath40channel @xmath41 angular momentum contribution . in analogy to finite energy srs , one might write down gpd ones that connect the ` low ' and ` high ' energy content of the gpd .",
    "additionally , one might set up a gpd model on its cross - over trajectory by factorizing it into a gpd for @xmath42 and a skewness function @xmath43 : @xmath44 f^{\\mp}(x,\\eta=0,t,{\\cal q}^2)\\,.\\ ] ] taking the limit @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ def - gdpsr ] ) , one finds a constraint for the skewness function @xmath46 where @xmath47 indicates analytic regularization .",
    "the skewness function can be simply evaluated within a given gpd model . to make contact with both phenomenology and lattice measurements , it is more appropriate to consider mellin moments .",
    "the skewness effects might be quantified by deviation factors : @xmath48 they are given by a series of local operator matrix elements @xmath49 with spin @xmath50 , containing @xmath51 total derivatives .",
    "the state of the art in lattice measurements is the evaluation of spin - three operator matrix elements , allowing for a first guess of @xmath52 .",
    "to hunt for the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment one should read formula ( [ cal - del ] ) as @xcite @xmath53 certainly , it will be challenging to measure @xmath54 .",
    "we emphasize that a measurement of the real and imaginary part allows to utilize the ` dispersion ' integral ( [ def - disrel1 ] ) as a sr . assuming a regge - like extrapolation in the small @xmath55 region , one",
    "might then even extract @xmath56 in the large @xmath55 region .",
    "the deviation factor @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ acc - am ] ) reminds us that a ` measurement ' of the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment requires an understanding of the skewness effect .",
    "the cff @xmath58 might be measured in dvcs on neutron , from the transverse proton spin asymmetry or the beam charge asymmetry at small @xmath55 .",
    "presently , one can only obtain a ` local ' constraint on the gpd @xmath0 .",
    "we have modelled valence gpds at @xmath42 , adjusted them to the nucleon form factors and pdfs .",
    "we have varied the skewness function , constrained by eq .",
    "( [ def - skepar ] ) and jlab / hall a dvcs off proton data @xcite , and estimated the sea quark contribution to @xmath2 by a gpd model dependent extrapolation of dvcs measurements in collider kinematics .",
    "we have found that @xmath2 and @xmath59 contribute only little to the interference term in dvcs off neutron @xcite and that the @xmath0-constraint is mainly given by the experimental error ( @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 with our ansatz for @xmath0 and supposing @xmath62 we found it likely that the valence contribution in ( [ con - e ] ) is about @xmath63 .",
    "being optimistic , we might state that @xmath64 is constrained by @xmath65 this is a rather weak condition , since for this kinematical point the modulus @xmath66 should be in a pessimistic case of a large skewness effect restricted to be @xmath67 .",
    "this exceeds the interval of @xmath68 , which covers @xmath69 .",
    "+ we conclude that dispersion techniques should be employed to reveal gpds on its cross - over trajectory from present dvcs measurements in fixed target kinematics .",
