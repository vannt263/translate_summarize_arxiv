    "moduli spaces for quiver representations have been defined by king in @xcite , a quiver grassmannian is just the variety of all submodules of a given module @xmath10 of a fixed dimension vector .",
    "we note that we can consider moduli spaces and also quiver grassmannians with its natural scheme structure .",
    "moreover , any quiver grassmannian is a moduli space ( just a moduli space of submodules of a given module ) , and there are natural morphisms between quiver grassmannians and moduli spaces . under certain additional conditions",
    "these morphisms are even isomorphisms .",
    "those isomorphisms are always hidden in our construction . since these morphisms can be seen explicitely in our construction we do not need any general result for those morphisms .",
    "this is the main reason why we use line bundles in our construction , for arbitrary vector bundles all constructions become much more technical .",
    "the other advantage of using line bundles is that we can always use modules of dimension vector @xmath11 ( also called thin sincere ) .",

    "@xmath1 is isomorphic to the quiver grassmannian of all submodules of @xmath10 of dimension vector @xmath15 for the quiver @xmath7 .",

    "we refer to section [ sect2 ] .",
    "the result on quiver grassmannians recently attracted attention in connection with cluster algebras ( see @xcite ) and in connection with auslanders theory on morphisms determined by objects .",
    "ringel has already pointed out that the result above has been studied by several authors ( @xcite ) , however can be traced back to beilinson ( @xcite ) .",
    "the principal aim of this note is to show how , we can use beilinson , and even better , how we can even improve it .",
    "eventually , we show that all the constructions at the end can be traced back to a tautological construction in algebraic geometry .",
    "any scheme @xmath1 is its own hilbert scheme of sheaves of lenght one : @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the second result , for a variety @xmath1 , was already stated in @xcite and proven again with different methods in @xcite .",
    "it can certainly be traced back to the work in @xcite .",
    "an affine version was already proven in @xcite . however , the first published result in this direction was just an example in @xcite",
    ". we will give a common frame for all those examples , in fact all are variants of the hilbert scheme construction in algebraic geometry and a variant of beilinsons equvivalence .",
    "ringel already noticed that we can even work with the kronecker quiver , thus , two vertices are sufficient for @xmath7 . improving this construction slightly",
    ", we can even realize any projective subscheme of the @xmath13dimensional projective space as a quiver grassmannian for the @xmath18kronecker quiver .",
    "this construction is again explicit .",
    "we denote the the @xmath19th homogenous component of the ideal @xmath20 generated by the polynomials @xmath16 by @xmath21 .",
    "thus the homogeneous coordinate ring of @xmath1 is just @xmath22 for some @xmath18dimensional vector space @xmath23 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath24 a natural number greater or equal to the maximal degree of the the polynomials @xmath16 .",
    "[ thmkronecker ] let @xmath1 be any projective subscheme of the @xmath13dimensional projective space @xmath2 .",
    "there is a module @xmath25 over the kronecker algebra defined by the natural map @xmath26",
    ". then @xmath1 is isomorphic to the quiver grassmannian of submodules of @xmath10 of dimension vector @xmath27 .",
    "the principal part of the note consists of a five step construction that we will use to get a realisation of @xmath1 as such a moduli space .",
    "in addition we also add some modifications of these steps allowing to simplify the quiver or the relations .",
    "we explain these five steps briefly . first note , that any scheme @xmath1 is its own hilbert scheme of sheaves of length one .",
    "so any projective scheme is a moduli space of sheaves ( in a rather trivial way ) . in a second step",
    "we use beilinson s equivalence to construct for @xmath1 an algebra @xmath28 .",
    "roughly , we can take any tilting bundle @xmath29 on @xmath30 , extend it by any other vector bundle @xmath31 to @xmath32 and apply @xmath33 to the universal family of the hilbert scheme @xmath1 . in the particular case when @xmath29 is the direct sum of the line bundles @xmath34 , for @xmath35",
    ", we can just extend it by the line bundles @xmath34 for @xmath36 . in this way",
    ", we get a family of modules over the beilinson algebra for @xmath29 and a family of modules over the enlarged beilinson algebra for @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath1 is given by polynomials as above , all modules of the family also satisfy the equations @xmath16 , however now in the beilinson algebra .",
    "thus we define @xmath8 to be the ideal generated by the @xmath16 in the enlarged beilinson algebra .",
    "note that we have several choices for such realization , depending on where the relation starts .",
    "however , one can check directly , that family of all modules of dimension vector @xmath14 over @xmath5 , the enlarged beilinson algebra with relations @xmath8 , coincides with @xmath1 , independent of the this realization . consequently",
    ", the moduli space of all modules of dimension vector @xmath15 over @xmath5 is @xmath1 as a scheme . in a final step ,",
    "we realize @xmath1 as a quiver grassmannian by using an injectice hull in @xmath5 .",
    "we already mentioned that this construction is more general in the way that we can take any tilting bundle @xmath29 and any vector bundle @xmath31 , however the direct computation seems to be more sophisticated .",
    "so we use line bundles just for simplicity .",
    "even stronger , in general we do not need @xmath29 to be a tilting bundle . for example , the construction also would work if we only take @xmath38 where @xmath24 is at least the maximal degree of the @xmath16 .",
    "then we get a realization similar to reinekes construction , that is in fact a variant of the realization for the kronecker quiver .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section we present the five steps of our construction together with a final note on framed moduli spaces . in the third section we reprove the already known results using the construction in section [ sect2 ] .",
    "we conclude in the last section with some open problems and a proof of the second theorem .",
    "we construct , using some elementary results from algebraic geometry , for any algebraic variety a moduli space of quiver representations , a quiver grassmannian and also further examples in five steps .",
    "we also note , that this even holds for any scheme that is quasi - projective .",
    "so we obtain the authors example from 1996 @xcite , huisgen - zimmermann s examples in her work on uniserial modules ( see for example @xcite , and her work with bongartz @xcite on grassmannians , we apologize for being not complete ) , a variant of reineke s result for quiver - grassmannians from 2012 @xcite and last not least michel van den bergh s example , that appeared in a blog of lieven le bruyn .",
    "in fact , all the results at the end of this note can be proven using the following constructions .",
    "( @xcite )    we take an algebraic variety @xmath1 and consider sheaves of length one on @xmath1 .",
    "there is a bijection between those sheaves and points of @xmath1 . in a more sophisticated way we can say @xmath39 the hilbert scheme of length one sheaves on @xmath1 . or",
    ", we can consider any line bundle @xmath40 on @xmath1 as a fine moduli space of skyscraper sheaves by taking the push forward to the diagonal in @xmath41 .",
    "each fiber of some point @xmath42 for the first projection is just the skyscraper sheaf in @xmath42 .",
    "( @xcite )    in the second step we transform the construction above to the representation theoretic side using tilting . to keep the construction easy",
    ", we consider the beilinson tilting bundle @xmath43 on the @xmath13dimensional projective space @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the beilinson algebra , it is the opposite of @xmath44 . take @xmath45 to be a skyscraper sheaf and let us compute @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath47 , thus we get thin sincere representations of @xmath5 , that is each simple occurs with multiplicity one .",
    "now we can see by direct computations that the moduli space of thin sincere representations of @xmath5 is just the projective space @xmath2 .",
    "this example can be easily generalized to any tilting bundle @xmath29 , however , using sheaves ( that are not vector bundles ) we do not get a flat family ( the dimension above jumps at certain points ) .",
    "( @xcite )    now we consider @xmath48 , any subvariety defined by equations @xmath49 in a projective @xmath13space @xmath2 .",
    "assume first @xmath50 for all @xmath51 .",
    "note that the quiver of the beilinson algebra above has @xmath52 arrows from @xmath51 to @xmath53 , we denote by @xmath54 , and paths the monomials @xmath55 of degree @xmath56 at most @xmath13 .",
    "we define an algebra @xmath57 as the quotient of @xmath5 by the ideal @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is any linear combination of path representing @xmath60 in @xmath5 .",
    "note that any representative works , since the arrows in @xmath5 commute , whenever this makes sense : @xmath61 .",
    "this solves the problem we address to the next step already , since @xmath62 for any @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , we could also use the fact , that any projective algebraic variety is already defined by quadratic relations .",
    "however , using serre s theorem we can handle also relations of any degree in @xmath2 .             to obtain @xmath48 , as in the previous step , where @xmath64 for any @xmath65 , we consider the sequence of line bundles @xmath66 .",
    "the direct sum of these line bundles is no longer a tilting bundle , however the same computation as above shows that the moduli space of all thin sincere representations of @xmath5 is still a projective @xmath13space .",
    "now the representatives @xmath67 of the polynomials @xmath16 live in @xmath68 and the moduli space of thin sincere representations of @xmath69 is @xmath48 ( even scheme theoretic ) .",
    "the reader familiar with serre s construction will notice that this step is just inspired by this construction ( @xcite ) .",
    "in a final step , we use the embedding of the thin sincere representations of @xmath57 in its minimal injective hull @xmath10 . note that @xmath20 is the indecomposable injective module with the unique simple socle , that is the socle of any thin sincere representation of @xmath57 . in case @xmath70 ( all @xmath16 are zero ) we obtain the projective space as quiver grassmannian of thin sincere subrepresentations of @xmath20 . in a similar way , also @xmath48 coincides with the quiver grassmannian of thin sincere subrepresentations of the large indecomposable injective @xmath57module @xmath10 .",
    "this final step goes back to schofield @xcite and was mentioned later also by van den bergh and ringel ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that quiver grassmannians can be obtained also directly from a corresponding construction in algebraic geometry .",
    "any skyscraper sheaf is the quotient of a line bundle @xmath71 .",
    "if we consider the moduli space of all those quotients of @xmath40 with fixed hilbert series of the quotient sheaf , we get the ( framed ) hilbert scheme , that coincides with the original one .",
    "if we apply beilinson s tilting again , we get for @xmath72 a projective @xmath5module .",
    "thus @xmath2 is the quotient grassmannian for the large ( that is sincere ) indecomposable projective @xmath5module . the same construction works with @xmath48 instead of @xmath2 .         note that any vector bundle @xmath73 for any @xmath74 with at least two elements on @xmath2 defines a morphism from @xmath2 to the moduli space of modules of dimension vector @xmath11 over @xmath75 ( or even over the path algebra of @xmath5 ) and also to the corresponding quiver grassmannian for the injective hull @xmath10 of an indecomposable of dimension vector @xmath11 .",
    "thus , for the projective @xmath13space even two line bundles are sufficient . in the last section",
    "we modify this construction slightly and consider @xmath74 consisting of three , repectively even two , elements so that we still get an isomorphism for any subscheme @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "we prove the theorem [ thm1 ] using the five steps above . in explicit terms",
    "the module @xmath10 is just defined by vector spaces @xmath76 the @xmath19th graded part of the homogeneous coordinate ring .",
    "this becomes a module over the beilinson quiver using the natural map @xmath77 as a multiplication map as follows .",
    "take a basis @xmath78 of @xmath23 and define the linear map of the @xmath51th arrow just by tensoring with @xmath79 : @xmath80 .",
    "the commutative relations force that the moduli space ( or the corresponding quiver grassmannian in @xmath10 ) of thin sincere modules is just a subscheme in @xmath2 defined by some of the polynomials @xmath16 .",
    "if we consider sufficiently many degrees @xmath19 , then any @xmath16 is realized in some homogeneous part @xmath21 of the ideal @xmath20 .",
    "for example the two degrees @xmath81 are sufficient to see any @xmath16 .",
    "thus , if we take the beilinson quiver with vertices @xmath82 we can certainly realize the variety @xmath1 .    conversely , we may ask how many degrees we need to realize @xmath1 in the module @xmath10 . a similar consideration as above shows that the three degrees @xmath83 are sufficient , provided @xmath24 is at least the maximum of all degrees of the polynomials @xmath16 , and @xmath84 can be any natural number with @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , we can take @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "this leads to the proof of the second theorem proven in the last section .",
    "the lemma below reduces than even to the kronecker quiver .",
    "now we can use the construction above to get many variations , we can not list all , however we should collect some .",
    "first we construct affine examples .",
    "one way is to take open subvarieties , however we would like to characterize open subsets module theoretic .",
    "huisgen - zimmermann started to consider uniserial modules in @xcite . to obtain affine varieties as moduli spaces of uniserial modules ,",
    "we consider a variant of the beilinson quiver , we replace the first arrow @xmath88 just by a path @xmath89 of length two",
    ". then a thin sincere module is uniserial precisely when its map @xmath89 is not zero .",
    "thus it is the open subvariety ( subscheme ) defined by @xmath90 , that is an affine chart .            in our opinion",
    "there are two kind of consequences .",
    "first one might think that we can now obtain results in algebraic geometry using representation theory .",
    "this seems to be impossible , as far we consider any algebraic variety .",
    "however , restricting to some subclasses this might be fruitful , we mention some open problems at the end of this note . moreover , for our construction",
    ", using the beilinson algebra , the relations are directly given by the defining polynomials .",
    "thus we do not get any deeper insight by considering an algebraic variety as a moduli space of quiver representations .",
    "the second consequence concerns the realisation of a variety as a particular moduli space , that is more restrictive .",
    "this is often very useful and is already used quite often .",
    "the main open problem here seems to be to construct all moduli spaces of quiver representations for a particular quiver . in general , for all dimension vectors , this is even open for the @xmath91arrow kronecker quiver .",
    "we use the construction in the previous section to prove some of the already known results just by applying the five steps .",
    "we start with any projective algebraic variety and proceed with affine ones .",
    "as we already explained , we consider @xmath1 as the scheme of length one sheaves on itself and apply the beilinson tilting bundle .",
    "@xcite any projective algebraic scheme of finite type is a fine moduli space of modules over some finite dimensional algebra ( a bounded path algebra ) .",
    "moreover , we can obtain it already for the thin sincere representations , that is the jordan - hlder series contains each simple module just once in its composition series up to isomorphism .",
    "taking open parts we recover the result of huisgen - zimmermann , that was obtained using uniserial modules ( theorem g in @xcite ) .",
    "note , the result was stated in @xcite in a different language , the notion of a moduli space was adapted by her only later .",
    "then grassmannians also appeared in huisgen - zimmermann s work , however the idea was already introduced by schofield @xcite and then intensively used by nakajima @xcite . however",
    ", a similar result could be read of from the work of bongartz and huisgen - zimmermann and was later explicitely stated in @xcite . here",
    "again we can use thin sincere submodules of a module @xmath10 or just uniserial modules .        using the beilinson construction with a rather small vector bundle",
    "we can reduce the quiver even to the kronecker quiver .",
    "this is almost the same construction as in reinekes work and based on the following geometric construction .",
    "consider @xmath92 embedded into @xmath93 with the @xmath19uple embedding .",
    "assume @xmath1 is a subscheme in @xmath94 and consider its image in @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath19 is larger than the maximal degree of the polynomials @xmath16 defining @xmath1 , the equations of @xmath1 in @xmath93 are just linear and the defining equations of the embedding @xmath95 ( that are quadratic ) . just modilfying the beilinson construction we can use the bundle @xmath96 .",
    "this reduces the construction to a quiver with three vertices . for @xmath97 and @xmath24 sufficiently large",
    ", this corresponds to realizing @xmath1 using quadratic equations .",
    "the corresponding module @xmath10 considered as a representation of a three vertex quiver @xmath98 has a simple socle @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "now we use ringels idea to reduce to the kronecker quiver @xmath102 .    with notation above and",
    "any @xmath103 we have an isomorphism of quiver grassmannians as follows .",
    "the quiver grassmannian of submodules of @xmath104 of dimension vector @xmath105 is isomorphic to the quiver grassmannian of submodules of @xmath106 of dimension vector @xmath27 .    proof .",
    "note that the restriction of @xmath10 to @xmath107 defines a morphism of quiver grassmannians .",
    "since @xmath108 is just one  dimensional , any submodule @xmath107 over the kronecker algebra of dimension vector @xmath27 extends uniquely to a submodule of @xmath10 of dimension vector @xmath105 .",
    "thus , this morphism is a bijection . in the particular case of @xmath1 being the projective space ,",
    "this morphism is an isomorphism .",
    "going back to @xmath10 we just restrict this isomorphism to the subscheme defined by the polynomials @xmath16 , consequently , both quiver grassmannians are also isomorphic .",
    "@xmath109    taking @xmath24 at least the degree of the defining equations @xmath16 and @xmath110 we realize @xmath1 as a quiver grassmannian over the kronecker algebra with @xmath18 vertices .",
    "this proves theorem [ thmkronecker ] .",
    "note that reineke realized the linear subspace using an additional arrow , however , this is not necessary .",
    "obviously , we can not reduce to just one vertex , thus two vertices is the minimum we can achieve .",
    "however , it is not clear whether we can still reduce the number of arrows .",
    "such a reduction would be more complicated and certainly independent of beilinsons result .      at the end",
    "we discuss the problem how to obtain projective examples from affine ones and vice versa . as we have mentioned above , one can take a projective variety , that is a moduli space , and obtain an affine cover as moduli spaces of uniserials by modifying the beilinson quiver slightly .",
    "the converse , to obtain complete examples by glueing , is an open problem . in particular , let @xmath1 be a complete variety that is not projective ( see hartshorne for an example @xcite , ex 3.4.1 in appendix b ) then to our knowledge there is no way so far , to get @xmath1 as a moduli space of representations .",
    "moreover , it is clear that @xmath1 can not be a quiver grassmannian , since the latter one is projective by definition .",
    "one might think that also moduli spaces are always projective , however , we should mention that moduli spaces as constructed in king s paper @xcite are , but there might be other constructions as well .",
    "since already kronecker quivers are very complicated with respect to the geometry of quiver grassmannians it would be natural to restrict to particular classes of modules or quivers . as far we know , the problem to describe all quiver grassmannians is open for dynkin quivers and also tame quivers .",
    "it also would be desirable to understand quiver grassmannians for the @xmath91arrow kronecker quiver .",
    "moreover , inspired by cluster algebras , the main open problem seems to be to understand quiver grassmannians for exceptional modules over path algebras .",
    "if we use the explicit construction of the module @xmath10 with @xmath76 one can see , that everything is even defined over any base field . for polynomials over the integers",
    "everything is defined even over @xmath111 .",
    "thus the construction also works in the same fashion over an commutative ring ."
