    "black holes are the central objects of study in general relativity .",
    "the presence of a black hole is usually detected through the existence of a trapped surface , namely a two dimensional space - like sphere whose outgoing and incoming expansions are negative .",
    "the celebrated penrose singularity theorem states that under suitable assumptions , if the space - time has a trapped surface , then the space - time is future causally geodesically incomplete , i.e. , it must be singular , at least in some weak sense .",
    "on the other hand , the weak cosmic censorship conjecture ( wcc ) asserts that singularities have to be hidden from an observer at infinity by the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "thus , assuming wcc , the theorem of penrose predicts the existence of black holes , via the exhibition of a trapped surface .",
    "this is precisely the reason why the trapped surfaces are intimately related to the understanding of the mechanism of gravitational collapse .    in @xcite",
    ", christodoulou discovered a remarkable mechanism responsible for the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces .",
    "he proved that a trapped surface can form , even in vacuum space - time , from completely dispersed initial configurations ( i.e. , free of any trapped surfaces ) and purely by the focusing effect of gravitational waves .",
    "christodoulou described an open set of initial data ( so called _ short pulse ansatz _ ) on an outgoing null hypersurfaces without any symmetry assumptions .",
    "based on the techniques he and klainerman developed in @xcite proving the global stability of the minkowski space - time , he managed to understand the cancelations among the different components of connection and curvature .",
    "this eventually enabled him to obtain a complete picture of how the various geometric quantities propagate along the evolution .",
    "christodoulou also proved a version of the above result for data prescribed at the past null infinity .",
    "he showed that strongly focused gravitational waves , coming in from past null infinity , lead to a trapped surface .",
    "more precisely , he showed that if the incoming energy per unit solid angle in each direction in an advanced time interval @xmath0 $ ] at null infinity is sufficiently large ( and yet sufficiently dispersed so that no trapped surfaces are present ) the focusing effect will lead to gravitational collapses . besides its important physical significance , from the point of view of partial differential equations , it establishes the first result on the long time dynamics in general relativity for general initial data which are not necessarily close to the minkowski space - time .    in @xcite , klainerman and rodnianski extended christodoulou s result .",
    "they introduced a parabolic scaling and studied a broader class of initial data .",
    "the new scaling allowed them to capture the hidden smallness of the nonlinear interactions in einstein equations .",
    "another key observation in their paper is that , if one enlarges the admissible set of initial conditions , the corresponding propagation estimates are much easier to derive . based on this idea , they gave a significant simplification of christodoulou s result . at the same time , their relaxation of the propagation estimates were just enough to guarantee the formation of a trapped surface .",
    "based on the geometric sharp trace theorems , which they have introduced earlier in @xcite and applied to local well posedness for vacuum einstein equations in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , they were also able to reduce the number of derivatives needed in the estimates from two derivatives on curvature ( in christodoulou s proof ) to just one .",
    "the price for such a simpler proof , with a larger set of data , is that the natural propagation estimates , consistent with the new scaling , are weaker than those of christodoulou s . nevertheless ,",
    "once the main existence results are obtained , improved propagation estimates can be derived by assuming more conditions on the initial data , such as those consistent with christodoulou s assumptions .",
    "this procedure allows one to recover christodoulou s stronger results in a straightforward manner .",
    "we remark that , from a purely analytic point of view , the main difficulty of all the aforementioned results on dynamical formation of black holes is the proof of the long time existence results .",
    "the work @xcite overcomes this difficulty in an elegant way .",
    "when matter fields are present , some black - hole formation results have been established much earlier , under additional symmetry assumptions .",
    "the most important such work is by christodoulou ( see @xcite ) .",
    "he studied the evolutionary formation of singularities for the einstein - scalar field equations , under the assumption of spherical symmetry ( notice that according to birkhoff theorem , this assumption is not interesting in vacuum ) .",
    "the incoming energy of the scalar field was the main factor leading to the gravitational collapse .",
    "we note also that the work @xcite provides a much more precise picture for the large scale structure of the space - time , than that available in the general case .    in all the aforementioned works ,",
    "the initial data are prescribed on null hypersurfaces .",
    "it is however natural to study the question of formation of trapped surfaces for cauchy initial data .",
    "we first recall that cauchy data , i.e. , the data defined on a space - like hypersurface , must satisfy a system of partial differential equations , namely , the constraint equations .",
    "the main advantage of using characteristic initial data is that one has complete freedom in specifying data without any constraint .",
    "though christodoulou s results for initial data prescribed at past null infinity predicts , indirectly , the existence of asymptotically flat cauchy data , leading to a future trapped surface , it is natural to provide a constructive approach to this problem . in this connection",
    ", we mention an interesting piece of work @xcite by schoen and yau .",
    "they showed that on a space - like hypersurface , there exists a trapped surface when the matter field is condensed in a small region , see also @xcite for an improvement .",
    "their proof analyzed the constraint equations and made use of their earlier work on positive mass theorem ( especially the resolution of jang s equation ) .",
    "we remark that their work is not evolutionary and matter fields are essential to the existence of trapped surfaces .",
    "the goal of the current paper is to exhibit cauchy initial data for vacuum einstein field equations with a precise asymptotic behavior at space - like infinity , free of trapped surfaces , which lead to trapped surfaces along the evolution .",
    "we give the precise statement of the result in next section .",
    "let @xmath1 be a three dimensional differentiable manifold diffeomorphic to @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the standard coordinate system .",
    "we also use @xmath4 to denote the usual radius function .",
    "let @xmath5 be a given number , @xmath6 a small positive number and @xmath7 another small positive number .",
    "we divide @xmath1 into four concentric regions @xmath8 , where @xmath9 the numbers @xmath10 will be fixed in the sequel such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a cauchy initial datum for vacuum einstein field equations on @xmath1 consists of a riemannian metric @xmath13 and a symmetric two tensor @xmath14 ( as the second fundamental form ) subject to the following constraint equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath13 and @xmath17 is the mean curvature .    in order to state the main theorem , we also need to specify a mass parameter @xmath18 which will be defined in an explicit way in the course of the proof .",
    "our main result is as follows :    for any sufficiently small @xmath19 , there is a riemannian metric @xmath13 and a symmetric two tensor @xmath14 on @xmath1 satisfying , such that    * @xmath20 is a constant time slice in minkowski space - time , in fact , @xmath21 ; * @xmath22 is isometric to a constant time slice all the way up to space - like infinity in a kerr space - time with mass @xmath23 and angular momentum @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , @xmath25 ; * @xmath1 is free of trapped surfaces ; * trapped surfaces will form in the future domain of dependence of @xmath1 .    [",
    "remark on condition on initial mass ] the mass parameter @xmath26 reflects the amount of incoming gravitational energy that we inject into the minkowski space - time through an outgoing null hypersurface .",
    "it can be computed explicitly from the initial conditions as follows ( see section [ preliminaries ] for definitions ) : @xmath27    the regions @xmath28 and @xmath29 do not appear in the theorem . in the proof , we shall see that @xmath29 will be @xmath30-close to a constant time slice in a schwarzschild space - time with mass @xmath26 and @xmath28 will be constructed from christodoulou s short pulse ansatz .",
    "we now sketch the heuristics of the proof with the help the above picture .",
    "we start by describing initial data on a truncated null cone ( represented by the outgoing segment between the bottom vertex of the cone and the point @xmath31 in the picture ) .    the part of the cone between the vertex and @xmath32 will be a light cone in minkowski space - time , thus its future development , i.e.",
    ", the white region in the picture , is flat .    for data between @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we use christodoulou s initial data ( from which a trapped surface will appear on the top of the light grey region ) with an additional condition .",
    "this condition requires the incoming energy through this part of the cone be spherically symmetric .",
    "the main consequence of imposing this condition is that the incoming hypersurface from @xmath34 ( represented by segment between the light grey region and the grey region in the picture ) will be close to an incoming null cone in schwarzschild space - time .    for data between @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we require that its shear be identically zero . together with the data on @xmath36",
    ", one can show that this part of the data will be close to an outgoing null cone in schwarzschild space - time .",
    "we construct the grey region ( pictured above ) by means of solving the vacuum einstein equation using the initial data described in the previous two paragraphs .",
    "thanks to the consequences of our additional condition , this region is close to a region in schwarzschild space - time .    we then can choose a smooth space - like hypersurface such that it coincides with a constant time slice in minkowski space - time in the white region ( noted as @xmath20 in the picture ) and it is also close to a constant time slice in schwarzschild space - time ( noted as the gluing region in the picture ) . due to the closeness to schwarzschild slice , we can do explicit computations to understand the obstruction space needed in corvino - schoen construction and we can eventually attach a kerr slice to this region",
    ".      we would like to address now the motivations for and difficulties in the proof .    as we stated in the main theorem ,",
    "the ultimate goal is to obtain a kerr slice @xmath22 . to this end",
    ", we would like to use a gluing construction for the constraint equations due to corvino and schoen @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , if two initial data sets are close to each other , this construction allows us to patch one to another along a gluing region without changing the data outside .",
    "similar results have also been obtained by chruciel and delay in @xcite .",
    "we also note that in @xcite , there is a gluing construction with background metric close to the minkowski metric , while in our work the background will be close to a schwarzschild slice instead .",
    "@xcite extended an earlier work of corvino @xcite which proved a parallel result for time symmetric data . both constructions in @xcite and @xcite relied on the study of local deformations of the constraint maps ( see section [ the work of corvino - schoen ] ) .",
    "we will also have to make use of the deformation technique .",
    "morally speaking , three ingredients are required to implement this approach :    * a reasonable amount of differentiability , say some @xmath37 control on the background geometry .",
    "this is necessary since the local deformation techniques can only be proved for a relatively regular class of data , see section [ the work of corvino - schoen ] or @xcite for details .",
    "* some precise information on the background metric .",
    "this is essential since eventually we can only glue two data sets close to each other .",
    "a priori , one of them is a kerr slice .",
    "therefore , we expect to contract some space - time close to some kerr slice on a given region .",
    "we call this requirement the _ smallness _ condition since it will be captured eventually by the smallness of @xmath30 .",
    "* the gluing region must have a fixed size .",
    "this is important because the local deformation techniques work only on a fixed open set .",
    "if the gluing region shrinks to zero , it is not clear how one can proceed .",
    "the first ingredient on the differentiability motivates us to derive the higher order energy estimates in section [ higher order energy estimates ] . in christodoulou s work @xcite , he obtained energy estimates up to two derivatives on the curvature components .",
    "he also had energy estimates for higher order derivatives , but the bounds were far from sharp . for our purposes , we require not only differentiabilities but also better bounds .",
    "the second ingredient turns out to be the key of the entire proof .",
    "first of all , we remark that the higher order energy estimates are also important for the second ingredient . to clarify this connection",
    ", we review a technical part of christodoulou s proof in @xcite .",
    "one of the most difficult estimates is the control on @xmath38 .",
    "he used two mass aspect functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 coupled with @xmath41 and @xmath42 in hodge systems .",
    "the procedure allowed him to gain one derivative from elliptic estimates to close the bootstrap argument .",
    "however , he had to incur a loss of smallness on the third derivatives of @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that the loss only happened to the top order derivatives .",
    "in fact , for lower order derivatives , we can integrate some propagation equations to obtain smallness ( but this integration loses one derivative instead ! ) .",
    "in other words , we can afford one more derivative in exchange for the smallness . from the above ,",
    "it is clear that once we have higher order energy estimates , we can expect better controls .    to obtain the second ingredient",
    ", we will show that a carefully designed data will evolve to a region that is @xmath30-close to some schwarzschild space - time ; it is in this sense that we have precise information on the background metric . as a consequence",
    ", we will be able to write down explicitly a four dimensional space in the kernel of the formal adjoint of the linearized constraint maps .",
    "this kernel is the obstruction space for the gluing construction , and we shall use mass and angular momentum ( which is of four dimensions in total ) of the kerr family to remove the obstruction . in this connection , we want to point out that in the work of reiterer and trubowitz @xcite , they also obtained such a near schwarzschild space - time region ( which to the best of our knowledge may not satisfy the requirement in our third ingredient ) .    to obtain an almost schwarzschild slab , one needs a careful choice of initial data among the short pulse ansatz of christodoulou .",
    "we shall impose the following condition : @xmath43 namely , independent of the @xmath44 variable .",
    "heuristically , this says that the total incoming gravitational energy is the same for all the spherical directions .",
    "we expect that through such a pulse of incoming gravitational wave , after an advanced time interval @xmath0 $ ] , we can regain certain spherical symmetry .",
    "we remark that the above condition is the main innovation of the paper and will be crucial to almost all of our estimates .",
    "finally , we discuss our third ingredient .",
    "one may attempt to carry out the gluing directly on the space - time constructed in christodoulou s work .",
    "however , when the parameter @xmath45 goes to zero , one runs the risk of shrinking the gluing region to zero . to solve this difficulty",
    ", we will further extend the short pulse ansatz beyond the the advanced time interval @xmath0 $ ] to @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "this extension allows us to further solve einstein equations to construct a space - time slab of a fixed size .    to close the section",
    ", we would like to discuss a way to prove the main theorem based on the work of klainerman and rodnianski @xcite instead of the stronger result @xcite of christodoulou .",
    "since we have to rely on higher order derivative estimates , we can actually start with the existence result in @xcite which only has control up to first derivatives on curvature .",
    "we then can assume more on the data , as we mentioned in the introduction , to derive more on the solution .",
    "as we will do in sequel , we can do the same induction argument on the number of derivatives on curvatures .",
    "this will yield the same higher order energy estimates and the rest of the proof remains the same .",
    "we follow the geometric setup in @xcite and use the double null foliations for most of the paper .",
    "we use @xmath47 to denote the underlying space - time and use @xmath48 to denote the background 3 + 1 dimensional lorentzian metric .",
    "we also use @xmath49 to denote the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath48 .",

    "combined with a fixed point argument , we use a four parameter family of kerr space - time , namely the mass @xmath23 and the angular momentum @xmath24 to kill the kernel .",

    "we are going to argue that we can choose suitable parameters @xmath975 so that @xmath976 . according to the above discussion , in order to show this , it suffices to show the projection of @xmath977 to @xmath153 vanishes , i.e. the following projection map @xmath978 hits zero : @xmath979 where @xmath980 , @xmath981 and @xmath982 for @xmath383 .",
    "we first analyze @xmath983 .",
    "we consider the taylor expansion of @xmath217 in banach space @xmath984 near the point @xmath958 , thus , we have @xmath985 we observe that the second and the last terms in the above integral are of size @xmath986 with respect to our small parameter @xmath671 .",
    "this is obvious for the last term . for the second term , recall that @xmath987 and @xmath971 vanishes near @xmath988 , therefore , @xmath989 we then subtract the above quantity from the second term to retrieve one more @xmath671 as follows @xmath990 for @xmath991 . finally , we consider the first term in @xmath983 . because @xmath992 , we will make use of the following key observation : @xmath993 this is obvious according to the formula for @xmath994 in last section .",
    "we also write @xmath995where @xmath996 is a two tensor and @xmath997 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath998 where @xmath999 . to compute the first term on the right hand side",
    ", we have to compute the scalar curvature @xmath1000 . by direct computation , @xmath1001 by virtue of this formula",
    ", we can easily derive @xmath1002 for the second term , we denote @xmath1003 recall that @xmath1004 , @xmath1005 near @xmath855 and @xmath1006 near @xmath859 , therefore @xmath1007 can be written as an integral on @xmath855 , which only depends on @xmath1008 on @xmath855 , and @xmath1009 .",
    "finally , we summarize the above calculations for @xmath983 as @xmath1010    for each @xmath383 , we analyze @xmath1011 as follows : @xmath1012 recall that @xmath1013 , @xmath958 coincides with @xmath1014 on @xmath855 and @xmath958 coincides with @xmath1015 on @xmath859 .",
    "we can apply stokes theorem to derive @xmath1016 where @xmath1017 is the volume form on the round sphere with radius @xmath287 .",
    "let @xmath1018 and it is a constant coming from the integral on the inner sphere @xmath855 . since @xmath48 is close to @xmath687 , we know that @xmath1019 . we emphasize that @xmath1020 is independent of @xmath975 and the constant @xmath950 .",
    "thus , @xmath1021 to understand the local behavior of @xmath1011 , we study the differential of the map @xmath1022 at @xmath1023 and the parameter @xmath23 is fixed .",
    "we first compute @xmath1024 when @xmath1025 , we have @xmath1026 since @xmath1027 does not depend on @xmath1028 and @xmath1029 .",
    "when @xmath1030 , similarly , we have @xmath1031 when @xmath1032 , in view of the exact formula for @xmath1033 in the previous section , the @xmath1034 component of @xmath1035 is of the form @xmath1036 for sufficiently small @xmath856 .",

    "suppose that the curve @xmath1077 intersects the `` central '' line @xmath1081 at @xmath1082 .",
    "let @xmath1083 which is smooth space - like hypersurface of @xmath207 with @xmath871 as the induced metric and the second fundamental form .",
    "it is clear from the construction that @xmath21 for @xmath1084 where @xmath45 is the euclidean metric on the ball of radius @xmath1085 which is the radius of @xmath1086 computed in @xmath48 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath1087 .",
    "we divide @xmath1088 with cartesian coordinate @xmath888 into four concentric regions @xmath20 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath22 as @xmath1089 by construction we have @xmath11 and @xmath1090 .",
    "thus , @xmath1091 is diffeomorphic to @xmath1092 and @xmath860 is diffeomorphic to @xmath29 .",
