    "classical charged particles confined in a single , two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer localize into a hexagonal lattice ( wigner crystal ) for sufficiently large densities and low temperatures .",
    "@xcite such a single - layer wigner crystal ( slwc ) has been realized , e.g. , on the surface of liquid helium .",
    "@xcite colloidal particles dissolved in water and placed between two glass plates is another example of an experimental system where classical particles exhibit wigner crystallization .",
    "@xcite electrons in 2d semiconductor heterostructures behave like quantum particles , but a strong perpendicular magnetic field quenches the kinetic energy , leading the system toward the classical regime .",
    "the quest for the observation of such a wigner crystal has been the object of very intense work over the last decades .",
    "@xcite the melting transition of the classical slwc , in particular , has attracted a large body of investigation  @xcite since the proposal of a dislocation - mediated melting mechanism , leading to the prediction of a continuos melting transition .",
    "@xcite    recently , a new 2d system has attracted the attention of several groups , namely , the wigner crystal in a bi - layer structure .",
    "one of the peculiarities of the bi - layer wigner crystal ( blwc ) , compared to the slwc , consists in the rich phase diagram ; it has been predicted that different crystalline structures are stable in different ranges of inter - layer distance / charge density .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we address the phase diagram of such bi - layer structures .",
    "@xcite we consider a blwc of coulombic particles evenly distributed between the two layers . in a classical blwc , the inter - particle interaction can be characterized by a unique dimensionless parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the inter - layer distance and @xmath2 is the total charge density .",
    "@xmath3 represents the ratio between the inter - particle interaction _ between _ the layer and _ within _ each layer .",
    "thus , in the classical case , the hamiltonian of the system is only a function of @xmath3 , which therefore determines completely the phase diagram at @xmath4 .",
    "this is in contrast with the equivalent quantum problem , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not scale out .",
    "the search for the stable structure of a classical blwc , at @xmath4 and as a function of @xmath3 , is made easier by the following considerations : 1 ) due to the long - range interaction , the two lattices which occupy the two layers ( sub - lattices ) are staggered to maximize the inter - particle distance .",
    "each lattice site sits at the center of a cell in the opposite layer ; 2 ) there are two trivial limiting cases : at @xmath5 the two sub - lattices reduce to a slwc , which is known to crystallize in a hexagonal lattice ( one - component hexagonal lattice ) . at the opposite limit of large @xmath3 the two sub - lattices",
    "are weakly coupled and , therefore , the stable structure is constituted by two staggered slwc ( staggered hexagonal lattice ) . by comparing the static energy of several lattices , we find that five different phases are energetically favoured in different ranges of @xmath3 .",
    "the five structures , in order of increasing @xmath3 , are a one - component hexagonal lattice ( i ) , a staggered rectangular lattice ( ii ) , a staggered square lattice ( iii ) , a staggered rhombic lattice ( iv ) , and a staggered hexagonal lattice ( v ) .",
    "these phases evolve one into the other through both first and second order phase transitions .",
    "there exist already a number of investigations of the @xmath4 phase diagram of the classical blwc in various systems .",
    "@xcite some of the previous investigations of the present system  @xcite did not identify all five phases . in ref .",
    ", the bi - layer electron system which forms in a single wide quantum well above a critical density  @xcite was studied . in this case , the transition from the single layer to the bi - layer ( and , at higher densities , to a higher number of layers ) is of first order , with @xmath3 which jumps from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; therefore , the low-@xmath3 phases i and ii were not investigated in ref .  .",
    "theoretical investigations suggest that also bi - layer structures in the quantum regime possess a complex phase diagram . in ref .",
    "a structural instability is found in the strong coupling regime , when the tunneling probability decreases below a critical threshold as a consequence of layer separation .",
    "the five phases described above have been predicted to exist in a bi - layer quantum hall system .",
    "@xcite in this case , the phase diagram is even more complex , because a spin structure is associated with the lattice structure .",
    "other bi - layer structures with an even more complex phase diagram can be imagined , for example , with different densities of the two layers .",
    "@xcite    phonon excitations of some of the above systems have been partially investigated , within the harmonic approximation .",
    "@xcite phonon frequencies have been used to evaluate the zero - point energy and the critical density for cold melting of the quantum blwc  @xcite also in the presence of a magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we address the _ non - zero _ temperature phase diagram of a classical blwc , which has not been investigated so far . with this aim ,",
    "we have systematically investigated , within the harmonic approximation , the phonon excitations of each of the five structures .",
    "this allowed us not only to determine the range of structural stability and the behaviour of the acoustical and optical modes , which could be subject to experimental observations , but also allowed us to estimate the melting temperature of the crystal through the lindemann criterion .",
    "the latter states that melting takes place when the mean square displacement of the crystallized charges exceeds a certain fraction of the lattice parameter .",
    "it should be noted that in 2d the mean square displacement diverges logarithmically with the crystal size . on the other hand , the _",
    "relative _ mean square displacement between nearest neighbours ( nn s ) is a well defined quantity and its value at melting has been determined from simulations of 2d crystals .",
    "@xcite therefore , the latter quantity has been used in the present paper to estimate the melting temperature .",
    "our results show that , by changing @xmath3 at constant temperature , one can pass through alternating regions of crystalline and liquid order .",
    "the overlapping range of stability of different lattice structures along the @xmath3 axis suggests the possibility that temperature - induced structural phase transitions take place , before the melting temperature is reached . to investigate this last possibility",

    "the energetically favoured lattice are , respectively , the slwc lattice with density @xmath2 ( phase i ) , and two uncoupled slwcs with density @xmath157 ( phase v ) ; therefore , the corresponding dos curves are equal up to a factor @xmath158 in the frequency scale .",

    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the softening of the ta mode of the square lattice ( phase iii ) discussed above .",
    "the resulting high density of low - frequency modes suggests that very large fluctuations of particles around their equilibrium lattice sites are possible ; correspondingly , a low melting temperature is expected in proximity of these points , as will be discussed in sec .",

    "in this section we will be concerned with the non - zero temperature properties of the blwc .",
    "first , we will use the calculated phonon excitation frequencies to estimate the melting temperature @xmath162 via the lindemann criterion . in principle , only order of magnitude estimates of @xmath162 are expected from an harmonic theory , since anharmonic terms of the potential become important when crystal vibrations are so large that the lattice is near to dissolve . in the case of the slwc ,",
    "apart from simulations , analytical methods have been successfully used to calculate @xmath162 by including anharmonic effects .",
    "@xcite these methods assume that melting proceeds through the dislocation mediated mechanism proposed by kosterlitz and thouless ,  @xcite halperin and nelson ,  @xcite and young  @xcite ( kthny theory ) .",
    "the ingredient of these calculations is the sound velocity of the ta mode of the lattice , which is assumed isotropic in the kthny theory and which is indeed the case in the simple hexagonal lattice of the slwc , but not in the blwc , where the ta mode , in general , is anisotropic , as is clear from fig .",

    "[ fig : melting ] shows that the melting temperature has an oscillating behaviour as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "this is a consequence of the vanishing of the ta phonon modes at the phase boundaries ii / iii and iii / iv , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamic ] .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath142 and as function of @xmath3 we observe that alternating solid and liquid phases are possible , and the reentrant solid phase has a different lattice geometry each time . furthermore , note from the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : melting ] that , for large values of @xmath3 , @xmath162 approaches the melting temperature of a slwc of density @xmath157 from below .",
    "in certain experimental realizations of the blwc it could be easier to change @xmath3 through a change in the charge density , keeping @xmath1 constant . therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fig : melting2 ] we show the calculated melting temperature in units of @xmath208 .",
    "note that in the classical regime the phase diagram is determined by @xmath3 and a dimensionless temperature , either @xmath209 or @xmath210 . in the quantum regime , instead , the kinetic energy term depends on the density alone and , therefore , the phase diagram must be drawn explicitly in the tree - parameter space @xmath211 .    the presence of different lattice geometries which are stable within the same range of @xmath3 suggests the possibility that , increasing @xmath207 at fixed @xmath3 , the blwc undergoes a structural phase transition , and , eventually , melts at a temperature appropriate to the high temperature phase . for example , it seems possible that for @xmath212 the blwc evolves from phase ii ( with some value of the aspect ratio which minimizes the static energy at @xmath4 ) to phase i ( aspect ratio @xmath213 ) , as @xmath207 exceeds some critical value , and eventually melts at a @xmath162 appropriate for phase i. to investigate such possibility we have minimized the free energy with respect to the lattice geometry at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath207 .",
    "the harmonic approximation of the free - energy in the high - temperature limit is @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a parameter which defines a distortion of the lattice .",
    "there are two ranges of @xmath3 where more than one phase is stable with respect to lattice vibrations ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : sound ] and [ fig : phase0 ] ) ; in the range @xmath216 phase ii is energetically favoured , but also phase i is stable throughout this range .",
    "therefore , in this range , we minimize f with respect to @xmath217 . in the range @xmath63 phase iv",
    "is energetically favoured , but also phase v is stable ; therefore , in this range we take @xmath218 .",
    "integration over reciprocal space in ( [ free_energy ] ) was performed numerically .",
    "we found that in both ranges the value of @xmath215 which minimizes f is practically independent of the temperature and , therefore , coincides with the @xmath4 value .",
    "in other words , the phase boundaries between the different geometries in fig .  [",
    "fig : melting ] are represented by vertical lines . moreover ,",
    "this justifies the fact that , in order to calculate @xmath162 for the `` soft '' phases ii and iv , we have used the @xmath4 value for the aspect ratio and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the phase diagram of a classical blwc , both at @xmath4 and at @xmath142 was investigated , within an harmonic approach , by use of the lindemann criterion and minimization of the harmonic free - energy .",
    "five different crystalline geometries are stable in different ranges of inter - layer distance / charge densities .",
    "moreover , at @xmath4 the five phases evolve one into the other through both continuous and discontinuous transitions . at @xmath142 ,",
    "alternating solid and liquid phases are possible , as one sweeps the inter - layer distance or the charge density . in particular , regions of liquid phase separate phase ii from phase iii , and",
    "phase iii from phase iv .",
    "this has been shown to be a consequence of lattice instabilities induced by the vanishing of phonon modes at the phase boundaries .",
    "on the other hand , a first order transition line separates iv from phase v.    an additional intricacy of the phase diagram in the small @xmath3 range has been pointed out by vilk and monarkha  @xcite . in this limit",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ potential_energy ] ) was mapped into the hamiltonian of a binary mixture of particles sitting on a triangular lattice and interacting through a dipole potential .",
    "therefore there is a possibility that a disordered phase appears , as the temperature is increased .",
    "they find two phase transitions .",
    "the low tempeature ( ordered ) phase is equivalent to our phase i. above a critical temperature @xmath219 the lattice can be seen as composed of three inter - penetrating triangular lattices , two of which are ordered and one is disordered . above a second critical temperature @xmath220 the lattice becomes completely disordered .",
    "of course the order - disorder transition vanishes as @xmath221 , where the two sublattices become equivalent .",
    "a bi - layer electron gas can easily be realized in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "@xcite although our results have been obtained for a classical system , they can give some indications on the phase diagram in quantum bi - layer structures , provided that temperature fluctuations are interpreted as quantum fluctuations .",
    "very recently , in ref .   a re - entrant phase around @xmath222 , analogous to ours in fig .  [ fig : melting ] , was predicted in the @xmath223 phase diagram , where @xmath224 is the dimensionless inverse electron density .",
    "furthermore , our analysis of the phonon excitations and the analytical fitting that we have developed retain their validity in the quantum regime .    in principle",
    ", the harmonic approximation used throughout this work is expected to fail when the temperature approaches the melting temperature .",
    "however , we have shown that , in the @xmath5 case , we obtain @xmath162 in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations and experiments on the slwc ; therefore , we believe that inclusion of the anharmonic effects would not change our results qualitatively , as far as the melting temperature is concerned .",
    "we believe also that the approximation of a structure independent parameter @xmath179 in the lindemann criterion should not change the nature of our findings . the harmonic approach could be a more severe approximation in the calculation of the free - energy and our investigation , therefore , does not rule out completely the possibility of temperature - induced structural phase transitions .",
