    "<S> [ fock_preparation](b ) , the fourier components satisfy @xmath85 for pulse times @xmath86 @xcite . by using the transitions with the largest frequency separation , the control pulse can be performed as quickly as possible .    </S>",
    "<S> this time advantage is particularly important in the presence of decoherence . following the analysis of @xcite , and letting the qubit and resonator have dissipation times of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , the fidelity of this transition is @xmath89 for both the single - step procedure and the procedure of @xcite . by reducing the total time of the sequence by a factor of two ( or more ) , </S>",

    "<S> this is not directly possible , as indicated by the lack of an edge between @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the coupling graph , but this rotation can nevertheless be performed by the sequence @xmath99 , as illustrated in fig . </S>",

    "<S> _ noon state synthesis_. as a final example , i consider the generation of entangled states between two superconducting resonators , of the form @xmath104 methods to synthesize such `` noon '' states have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite , the latter implemented in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this method outperforms previous proposals in two other ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , this method can be performed much faster than the first proposal @xcite , which used the dispersive number - state - dependent transitions . </S>",
    "<S> second , this method uses a two - level system to control the fock states , as opposed to using a three - level system to selectively excite the resonators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in @xcite , the use of higher excited states leads to a lower fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this approach is faster , achieves a higher fidelity , and uses fewer steps than previous proposals .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_. there are many applications of entangled resonators for quantum measurement , bell inequality tests , and quantum information , which have been described elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the all - resonant approach presented here provides an attractive route to enabling such applications , using existing technology .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two limitations to this approach , to which we now turn . to decouple the qubit - resonator state </S>",
    "<S> , we might use an adiabatic mapping of the uncoupled qubit - resonator state @xmath113 to the jaynes - cummings states @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> one means to alleviate this is to use a three - level system such that @xmath114 @xcite and apply resonant pulses to perform the mapping @xmath115 , followed by a control sequence on the states @xmath116 . an alternative is to use the kerr effect alone , as recently analyzed in @xcite , and drive the @xmath0 transitions , albeit at a slower rate . </S>",
    "<S> the second limitation is the direct excitation of qubit states , which thwarts taking full advantange of superconducting resonators , namely their potential for longer coherence times . </S>",
    "<S> however , current experiments have shown that qubits can have coherence times approaching @xmath117 @xcite , so that the method proposed here should allow for complex control of states with photon numbers of ten or more .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> i have proposed an all - resonant scheme to perform a range of quantum control protocols for superconducting resonators . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has many advantages over previous studies , and extensions may unlock the power of on - chip microwave photons . </S>",
    "<S> finally , many of these ideas can be directly applied to other systems of light interacting with real and artificial atomic systems .    </S>",
