    "optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .  2000 ) and",
    "the digitized palomar sky survey @xcite have revealed large samples of quasi - stellar objects out to @xmath19 .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite have shown that at such a high redshift we are approaching the epoch of reionization , the edge of the `` dark ages '' , when the first stars and massive black holes were formed .",
    "observations of high redshift qsos at mm and sub - mm wavelengths have shown that a significant fraction ( @xmath20 ) of the sources are strong emitters of far - infrared ( fir ) radiation , which is thermal emission from warm dust .",
    "these sources have luminosities @xmath21 , and molecular gas masses greater than @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the large reservoirs of warm gas and dust in these objects have led to the hypothesis that these are starburst galaxies with massive star formation rates on the order of 1000  @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "an important question regarding these high-@xmath23 qsos is whether the dust heating mechanism is dominated by a central agn , or starburst activity in the qso host galaxies . the high resolution of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations permits a detailed look at the physical structures in the most distant cosmic sources .",
    "also , sensitive vlbi continuum observations can be used to determine the nature of the energy source(s ) in these galaxies at radio frequencies .    to date",
    ", several high redshift qsos have been imaged at milliarcsecond resolution @xcite .",
    "these are the highest resolution studies of such distant qsos by far . in this paper",
    ", we present sensitive vlbi observations of the @xmath0 qso bri  13350417 .",
    "the source bri  13350417 , which has an optical redshift of @xmath24 , was identified in the automatic plate measuring ( apm ) survey @xcite .",
    "this qso is the second brightest source at millimeter wavelengths with redshifts @xmath25 , with the brightest being the @xmath26 qso bri  12020725 @xcite .",
    "the implied fir luminosity of bri  13350417 is @xmath27 . thus far , there is no evidence for multiple imaging in bri  13350417 due to strong gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of the qso bri  13350417 shows a strong absorption by ly@xmath28 and metal lines at the source redshift @xcite .",
    "its co  @xmath29 line emission was detected at @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the co  @xmath31 emission studies on this source by @xcite suggested optically thick emission from warm ( @xmath32  30  k ) molecular gas .",
    "the derived total molecular gas mass is @xmath33 , making bri  13350417 one of the most massive molecular gas reservoirs known at high redshifts .",
    "the source bri  13350417 is also detected in the radio continuum at 1.4 and 4.9  ghz with the very large array ( vla ) in c - configuration , with flux densities of @xmath34 and @xmath35jy , respectively @xcite .",
    "the source appears unresolved at the resolution of these vla observations , which is on the order of several arcseconds .    throughout this paper , we assume a flat cosmological model with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 . in this model , at the distance of bri 13350417 , 1  milliarcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to 6.6  pc .",
    "the vlbi observations of bri  13350417 were carried out at 1.4  ghz on 2005 december 31 and 2006 january 7 , using the high sensitivity array ( hsa ) , which included the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , the phased very large array ( vla ) , and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) of the nrao .",
    "four adjacent 8  mhz baseband channel pairs were used in the observations , both with right and left - hand circular polarizations , and sampled at two bits .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , nm , with 2  s correlator integration time .",
    "the total observing time was 14  hr . in these observations ,",
    "the shortest baseline is between the phased vla and the vlba antenna in pie town , nm , which is 52  km .",
    "this short - spacing limit filters out all spatial structure larger than about @xmath39 .",
    "table  1 summarizes the parameters of these observations .    the observations employed nodding - style phase referencing , using the calibrator j13350511 ( @xmath40  jy ) , with a cycle time of 4  min , 3  min on the target source and 1  min on the calibrator .",
    "a number of test cycles were also included to monitor the coherence of the phase referencing .",
    "these tests involved switching between two calibrators , the phase calibrator j13350511 and the phase - check calibrator j13320509 ( @xmath41  jy ) , using a similar cycle time to that used for the target source .",
    "the accuracy of the phase calibrator position is important in phase - referencing observations @xcite , as this determines the accuracy of the absolute position of the target source and any associated components .",
    "phase referencing , as used here , is known to preserve absolute astrometric positions to better than @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and astronomical information processing system ( aips@xmath43 ) of the nrao . after applying _ a priori _ flagging",
    ", amplitude calibration was performed using measurements of the antenna gain and system temperature for each station .",
    "ionospheric corrections were applied using the aips task `` tecor '' .",
    "the phase calibrator j13350511 was self - calibrated in both phase and amplitude and imaged in an iterative cycle .",
    "images of the phase - check calibrator , j13320509 , were deconvolved using two different approaches : ( a ) by applying the phase and the amplitude self - calibration solutions of the phase reference source j13350511 ( figure  1_a _ ) , and ( b ) by self calibrating j13320509 itself , in both phase and amplitude ( figure  1_b _ ) .",
    "the peak surface brightness ratio of the final images from the two approaches gives a measure of the effect of residual phase errors after phase referencing ( i.e. ` the coherence ' due to phase referencing ) . at all times",
    ", the coherence was found to be better than 98% .",
    "the self - calibration solutions of the phase calibrator , j13350511 , were applied on the target source , bri  13350417 , which was then deconvolved and imaged at various spatial resolutions by tapering the visibility data .",
    "imaging the target source at the full resolution of the vlbi array , which is @xmath7  mas ( @xmath8  pc , pa=@xmath44 ) , achieved an rms noise level of @xmath45jy  beam@xmath11 , but did not reveal any continuum component in the field of bri  13350417 .",
    "this indicates the absence of any compact radio continuum emission with flux densities of @xmath46jy  beam@xmath11 , which in turn implies an upper limit to the intrinsic brightness temperature ( corresponding to a rest frequency of @xmath478  ghz ) of @xmath48  k for any compact radio source in bri  13350417 .",
    "our coherence tests during these observations using two vlbi calibrators show that the lack of a strong point source in bri  13350417 at the full resolution of the array can not be due to the phase referencing procedure .",
    "the 4@xmath9 flux limit reported above is almost an order of magnitude lower than the flux measured by the vla ( @xmath49jy ) at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "this immediately implies that more than @xmath4780% of the radio continuum emission in bri  13350417 is extended and not confined to the central agn .    in the following",
    ", we will assess if our hsa observations can recover the flux seen by the vla .",
    "to do so , we applied a two - dimensional gaussian taper falling to 30% at 1  m@xmath50 to the visibility data in both the _ u_- and _ v_-directions .",
    "this gives a beam size of @xmath1  mas ( @xmath2  kpc , p.  a.= @xmath51 ) , and the resulting image is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the rms noise level in this naturally weighted image is @xmath52jy  beam@xmath11 .",
    "the peak flux density of the detected continuum source is @xmath53jy  beam@xmath11 , and the total flux density is @xmath3jy , which agrees well with the flux density measured with the vla at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "the size of the source at full width half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath4  mas ( @xmath54  kpc ) , and the derived intrinsic brightness temperature is @xmath55  k.    figure 3 shows the continuum emission in bri  13350417 at the highest angular resolutions for which there is at least 4.5@xmath9 detection ( @xmath56jy  beam@xmath11 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a resolution of @xmath13  mas ( @xmath14  kpc ) in position angle @xmath57 .",
    "this image was obtained by applying a two - dimensional gaussian taper falling to 30% at 5  m@xmath50 in both the _ u_- and _ v_-directions of the visibility data .",
    "the peak flux density of the continuum source detected at this resolution is @xmath58jy  beam@xmath11 , and the total flux density is @xmath59jy .",
    "the size of the source is @xmath15  mas ( @xmath16  kpc ) at fwhm , and its intrinsic brightness temperature is @xmath60  k. the results obtained at this resolution imply that about two thirds of the total radio emission emerges from the central @xmath470.3  kpc of bri  13350417 , and , likewise , one third arises from more extended scales ( @xmath471.3  kpc ) .",
    "we have detected 1.4  ghz emission from bri  133500417 ( corresponding to a rest frame frequency of @xmath478  ghz ) using the hsa . at a moderate resolution ( @xmath1  mas ;",
    "figure 2 ) the intrinsic brightness temperature value of the detected continuum structure is @xmath6  k. the measured flux density at this resolution is consistent with the vla flux density of this source @xcite .",
    "this implies that the radio continuum emission at 1.4  ghz is confined to the extent of the structure seen in the vlbi image ( figure  2 ) , which is @xmath54  kpc at fwhm .",
    "furthermore , the highest resolution image with continuum detection ( figure  3 ) shows that almost two thirds of the total radio continuum emission at 1.4  ghz is arising from the central @xmath470.3  kpc .    at the full resolution of our array ( @xmath7  mas ) ,",
    "the radio emission from bri  13350417 is resolved out and does not show any single dominant source of very high brightness temperature ( @xmath61 k ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the results obtained by @xcite on a sample of three high-@xmath23 radio - loud quasars which were imaged with the vlba , namely j1053 - 0016 ( @xmath62 ) , j1235 - 0003 ( @xmath63 ) , and j0913 + 5919 ( @xmath64 ) . in each of these @xmath65 quasars",
    ", a radio - loud agn dominates the emission at 1.4  ghz on a few mas size scale , with intrinsic brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath66  k.    @xcite have derived an empirical upper limit to the brightness temperature for nuclear starbursts of @xmath67  k at 8  ghz ( our rest frequency ) , while typical radio - loud agn have brightness temperatures exceeding this value by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "these authors also present a possible physical model for this limit involving a mixed non - thermal and thermal radio emitting ( and absorbing ) plasma , constrained by the radio - to - fir correlation for star - forming galaxies .",
    "for bri  13350417 , the derived intrinsic brightness temperatures from our vlbi observations are typical of starburst galaxies . also , the linear extent of the radio continuum emission region in bri  13350417 is typical of local starburst powered ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , such as arp  220 , mrk  273 , and iras  172080014 @xcite .",
    "another argument in favor of a massive starburst origin for the radio continuum emission from bri  13350417 is that this source follows the radio - fir correlation for star forming galaxies , although the massive star formation rate is extreme , of order a few thousand @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the physical characteristics of the qso bri  13350417 are similar to two other high-@xmath23 luminous ir sources ; the brightest mm source in the @xcite sample of qsos with redshifts between @xmath68 , namely j1409 + 5628 at @xmath69 , and the brightest mm source in the @xcite sample of qsos at redshifts @xmath25 , namely bri  12020725 at @xmath26 .",
    "high angular resolution observations of j1409 + 5628 and bri  12020725 at 1.4  ghz @xcite showed that the radio continuum emission in these optically very bright qsos is dominated by extreme nuclear starbursts , with massive star formation rates on the order of @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , sensitive , tapered vlbi images of bri  12020725 at 1.4  ghz @xcite revealed the starburst regions in each of its two components that are separated by @xmath71 , with sizes and brightness temperatures comparable to that seen in bri  13350417 .",
    "the measured 1.4  ghz radio flux density in bri  13350417 is consistent with extreme nuclear starburst activity , with the radio continuum being the sum of supernovae ( sne ) , supernova remnants , and residual relativistic electrons in the interstellar medium , as shown in the model presented by @xcite .",
    "however , detecting individual sne at @xmath72 is unlikely .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of several luminous radio sne in the prototype ulirg arp  220 with flux densities between 0.2 and 1.17 mjy and angular sizes on the order of 0.25  mas . at the distance of bri  13350417",
    ", the flux densities of such luminous radio sne would be between @xmath73jy .",
    "these values are three to four orders of magnitude lower that the rms noise levels achieved in our vlbi observations .",
