    "intermittency is well - known to be an ubiquitous phenomenon in nonlinear science .",
    "its arousal and main statistical properties have been studied and characterized already since long time ago , and different types of intermittency have been classified as types i  iii intermittencies  @xcite , on  off intermittency  , eyelet intermittency   and ring intermittency  @xcite .    despite of some similarity ( the presence of two different regimes alternating suddenly with each other in the time series ) ,",
    "every type of intermittency is governed by its own certain mechanisms and characteristics of the intermittent behavior ( such as the dependence of the mean length of the laminar phases on the control parameter , the distribution of the laminar phase lengths , etc . ) of different intermittency types are distinct .",
    "there are no doubts that different types of intermittent behavior may take place in a wide spectrum of systems , including cases of practical interest for applications in radio engineering , medical , physiological , and other applied sciences .",
    "this article is devoted to the comparison of characteristics of type - i intermittency in the presence of noise and eyelet intermittency taking place in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary .",
    "although these types of intermittency are known to be characterized by different theoretical laws , we show here for the first time that these two types of the intermittent behavior considered hitherto as different phenomena are , in fact , the same type of the system dynamics .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sct : relation ] we give the brief theoretical data concerning both the type - i intermittency with noise and eyelet intermittency observed in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary as well as arguments confirming the equivalence of these types of the dynamics .",

    "[ sct : conclusions ] .",
    "first , we consider briefly both eyelet intermittency in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary and type - i intermittency in the presence of noise following conceptions accepted generally . the main arguments confirming equivalence of these types of the intermittent behavior are given afterwards .      the intermittent behavior of type - i is known to be observed below the saddle - node bifurcation point , with the mean length of laminar phases @xmath0 being inversely proportional to the square root of the criticality parameter @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the control parameter and @xmath4 is its bifurcation value corresponding to the bifurcation point  @xcite .",
    "the influence of noise on the system results in the transformation of characteristics of intermittency  , with the intermittent behavior being observed in this case both below and above the saddle - node bifurcation point @xmath4 . in the supercritical region  @xcite of the control parameter values ( i.e. , above the point of bifurcation , @xmath5 ) the mean length @xmath0 of the laminar phases is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the intensity of a delta - correlated white noise @xmath9 [ @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with equation  ( [ eq : typeilawmeanlength ] ) being applicable in the region @xmath12 of the control parameter plane  @xcite . in this region",
    "the criticality parameter @xmath13 is large enough and , therefore , the approximate equation @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) is used typically ( see  @xcite for detail ) instead of  ( [ eq : typeilawmeanlength ] ) . in turn",
    ", the distribution @xmath16 of the laminar phase lengths @xmath17 is governed by the exponential law  @xcite @xmath18      for the chaotic systems in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary ( if the natural frequencies of oscillator and external signal are detuned slightly ) two types of the intermittent behavior and , correspondingly , two critical values are reported to exist  @xcite .",
    "below the boundary of the phase synchronization regime the dynamics of the phase difference @xmath19 features time intervals of the phase synchronized motion ( laminar phases ) persistently and intermittently interrupted by sudden phase slips ( turbulent phases ) during which the value of @xmath20 jumps up by @xmath21 . for two coupled chaotic systems there are two values of the coupling strength @xmath22 being the characteristic points which are considered to separate the different types of the dynamics . below the coupling strength value",
    "@xmath23 the type - i intermittency is observed , with the power law @xmath24 taking place for the mean length of the laminar phases , whereas above the critical point @xmath25 the phase synchronization regime is revealed . for the coupling strength @xmath26 the super - long laminar behavior ( the so called _ `` eyelet intermittency '' _ ) should be detected .",
    "for eyelet intermittency ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) the dependence of the mean length @xmath0 of the laminar phases on the criticality parameter is expected to follow the law @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the constants ) given for the first time in  @xcite for the transient statistics near the unstable - unstable pair bifurcation point . the analytical form of the distribution of the laminar phase lengths has not been reported anywhere hitherto for eyelet intermittency .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the eyelet intermittency phenomenon is based on the boundary crisis of the synchronous attractor caused by the unstable - unstable bifurcation when the saddle periodic orbit and repeller periodic orbit join and disappear  @xcite .",
    "this type of the intermittent behavior has been observed both in the numerical calculations  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite for the different nonlinear systems , including rssler oscillators .",
    "although type - i intermittency with noise and eyelet intermittency taking place in the vicinity of the chaotic phase synchronization onset seem to be different phenomena , they are really the same type of the dynamics observed under different conditions .",
    "the difference between these types of the intermittent behavior is only in the character of the external signal . in case of the type - i intermittency with noise the stochastic signal influences on the system , while in the case of eyelet intermittency the signal of chaotic dynamical system is used to drive the response chaotic oscillator . at the same time , the core mechanism governed the system behavior ( the motion in the vicinity of the bifurcation point disturbed by the stochastic or deterministic perturbations ) is the same in both cases . to emphasize the weak difference in the character of the driving signal we shall further use the terms `` type - i intermittency with noise '' and `` eyelet intermittency '' despite of the fact of the equivalence of these types of the intermittent behavior .    indeed , the phenomena observed near the synchronization boundary for periodic systems whose motion is perturbed by noise ( in other words , the behavior in the vicinity of the saddle - node bifurcation perturbed by noise ) have been shown recently to be the same as for chaotic oscillators in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary  @xcite .",
    "thus , both for two coupled chaotic rssler systems and driven van der pol oscillator the same scenarios of the synchronous regime destruction have been revealed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for two coupled rssler systems the behavior of the conditional lyapunov exponent in the vicinity of the onset of the phase synchronization regime is governed by the same laws as in the case of the driven van der pol oscillator in the presence of noise  @xcite .",
    "additionally , when the turbulent phase begins the phase trajectory demonstrates motion being close to periodic both for the eyelet intermittency observed in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary ( see  @xcite ) and for type - i intermittency with noise .",
    "finally , the repeller and saddle periodic orbits of the same period in the vicinity of the parameter region corresponding to the intermittent behavior tend to coalesce with each other ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) for both these types of the intermittent behavior .",
    "obviously , if the phenomena observed near the saddle - node bifurcation point for the systems whose motion is perturbed by noise are the same as for chaotic oscillators in the vicinity of the phase synchronization onset , one can expect that the intermittent behavior of two coupled chaotic oscillators near the phase synchronization boundary ( eyelet intermittency ) is also exactly the same as intermittency of type - i in the presence of noise in the supercritical region .",
    "so , if type - i intermittency with noise and eyelet intermittency taking place in the vicinity of the chaotic phase synchronization onset are the same type of the system dynamics , the theoretical equations  ( [ eq : typeilawmeanlengthapprox ] ) and ( [ eq : eyeletlawmeanlength ] ) obtained for these types of the intermittent behavior are the approximate expressions being the different forms of eq .",

    "[ fgr : probabilitysurfaces],_a_. it is clear that the probability to detect the turbulent phase for type - i intermittency with noise during one observation grows with the increase of the examination length @xmath145 but decreases when the criticality parameter @xmath159 is enlarged . obviously , if one examines ( experimentally or numerically ) the system behavior in the time interval with the length @xmath145 varying the control parameter @xmath3 , one observes the alternation of the laminar and turbulent phases for the relatively small values of the @xmath3-parameter , where @xmath144 is close to one , and only the laminar behavior for the relatively large ones , where @xmath144 is close to zero .",
    "having no information about the kind of intermittency ( e.g. , when the experimental study of some system is carried out ) one can suppose the presence of the boundary separating two different types ( intermittent and steady ) of dynamics and , moreover , find a value @xmath25 corresponding to the `` onset '' of the laminar behavior . evidently , this `` boundary point '' would be correspond to the low probability @xmath144 , say , e.g. @xmath160 .",
    "in addition , one can perform `` more careful '' measurements with the increased length @xmath161 of the observation to determine the value of the boundary point @xmath25 more precisely . in this case a new value @xmath162 would be obtained ( @xmath163 ) , with it being slightly larger than the previous one .",
    "the schematic location of the `` boundary '' curve @xmath164 on the plane @xmath165 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : probabilitysurfaces],_a _ by the solid line .",
    "it is clearly seen , that for the @xmath166-level the length @xmath145 grows extremely rapidly with the increase of the @xmath3-value . in other words , the major extensions of the observation interval @xmath145 result in the minor corrections of the `` boundary '' point @xmath25 .",
    "since the resources of the both experimental and numerical studies are always limited , some final value @xmath25 with the maximal possible accuracy will be eventually found .",
    "so , despite the fact , that for the type - i intermittency with noise in the supercritical region the turbulent phases can always be observed theoretically , from the practical point of view ( in the experimental studies or numerical calculations ) the boundary point @xmath25 exists , above which only the laminar behavior is observed .",
    "moreover , with the further development of the experimental and computational resources the additional studies would result only in the insufficient increase of the boundary value .    to illustrate the drawn conclusion we consider the circle map @xmath167 in the interval @xmath168 , where @xmath3 is the control parameter , @xmath169 , @xmath9 is supposed to be a delta - correlated gaussian white noise [ @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "if the intensity of noise @xmath8 is equal to zero , the saddle - node bifurcation is observed in  ( [ eq : circlemap ] ) for @xmath170 , when the stable and unstable fixed points annihilate at @xmath113 .",
    "obviously , for the selected value of the control parameter @xmath171 the evolution of system  ( [ eq : circlemap ] ) in the vicinity of the bifurcation point may be reduced to the quadratic map @xmath172 allowing an easy comparison with the results given in the previous sections .",
    "the intermittent behavior of type - i is observed for @xmath173 , whereas the stable fixed point takes place for @xmath174 . for the added stochastic force ( @xmath175 ) in circle map  ( [ eq : circlemap ] ) the intermittent behavior",
    "is also observed in the supercritical region of the criticality parameter @xmath3 , with the mean length @xmath0 of the laminar phases and the distribution @xmath16 of the laminar phase lengths @xmath17 obeying laws  ( [ eq : typeilawmeanlengthapprox ] ) and ( [ eq : lampahselengthdistribution ] ) , respectively .    the surface of the probability @xmath144 to observe the turbulent phase for the circle map  ( [ eq : circlemap ] ) as well as the corresponding level curves",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : probabilitysurfaces],_b_. to obtain this surface we have made @xmath176 observations for every point taken with the steps @xmath177 , @xmath178 on the parameter plane @xmath165 . the probability @xmath144 was calculated as @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the number of observations for which the turbulent phase has been detected .",
    "one can see the excellent agreement between the results of numerical calculations and theoretical predictions ( compare fig .",
    "[ fgr : probabilitysurfaces],_a _ and _ b _ ) .    similarly , the analogous probability surface @xmath181 and the level curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : probabilitysurfaces],_c _ have been calculated for two coupled rssler systems  ( [ eq : roesslers ] ) in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary , where eyelet intermittency is observed . in this case",
    "@xmath182 observations have been made for every point to be examined , with these points being taken with the steps @xmath183 and @xmath184 on the plane @xmath185 .",
    "it is easy to see that for the eyelet intermittency the probability surface as well as the level curves are exactly the same as for type - i intermittency with noise in the supercritical region . as a consequence",
    ", we can draw a conclusion , that the eyelet intermittency taking place in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary and type - i intermittency with noise in the supercritical region are the same type of the dynamics observed under different conditions .",
    "another consequence of the made consideration is the fact , that the phase synchronization boundary point can not be found absolutely exactly , since it separates the regions with the high and low probabilities to observe the phase slips in the coupled chaotic systems with the help of the experimental and computational resources existing at the moment of study . if someone , using a more powerful tools , tried to refine , say , the value of the coupling strength corresponding to the phase synchronization boundary reported in the earlier paper",
    ", one would obtain a new value being close to the previous one , but larger .",
    "exactly the same situation may be found , e.g. , in the work  @xcite , where two mutually coupled rssler systems have been considered . in this work the refined boundary value @xmath186",
    "is reported with the reference to the earlier work  @xcite , where the value @xmath187 was given .",
    "having considered two types of the intermittent behavior , namely eyelet intermittency taking place in the vicinity of the phase synchronization boundary and type - i intermittency with noise , supposed hitherto to be different , we have shown that these effects are the same type of the dynamics observed under different conditions . the analytical relation between coefficients of the theoretical equations corresponding to both types of the intermittent behavior has been obtained .",
    "the difference between these types of the intermittent behavior is only in the character of the external signal . in case of the type - i intermittency",
    "the stochastic signal influences on the system , while in the case of eyelet intermittency the signal of chaotic dynamical system is used to drive the response chaotic oscillator . at the same time , the core mechanism governed the system behavior as well as the characteristics of the system dynamics are the same in both cases .",
