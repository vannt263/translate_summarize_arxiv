    "with the advent of particle accelerators in the few @xmath3 energy region , heavy meson production in hadronic collisions has attracted increasing attention in the past few years . in particular ,",
    "heavy meson production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) collisions at near - threshold energies is of special interest , not only because it is suited for extracting information on a few lowest - order multipole amplitudes , but also because it is considered to provide important information on the short distance behavior of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "due to the large momentum transfer between the initial and final nucleons , these reactions at near - threshold energies necessarily probe the @xmath4 interaction at short distances . in the present work we concentrate on the @xmath2 meson production in proton - proton ( @xmath5 ) collisions .    among heavy mesons ,",
    "the @xmath2 meson is of particular interest for various reasons .",
    "the @xmath2 meson is thought to couple strongly to gluons via the qcd anomaly coupling @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "also , an unexpectedly large branching ratio measured recently for the inclusive decay of beauty particles , @xmath7 @xcite has been interpreted as possible evidence for the strong coupling of @xmath2 meson to the gluonic components@xcite .",
    "it would then be conceivable that the @xmath8 reaction might probe the gluon content of the @xmath2 meson via its coupling to gluons emitted from the quarks exchanged between two interacting nucleons .",
    "this mechanism would be complementary to the vector meson - exchange current mechanism for producing @xmath2 mesons .",
    "one of the properties of the @xmath9 meson of extreme importance is its yet - poorly - known coupling strength to the nucleon .",
    "this has attracted much attention in connection with the so - called  nucleon - spin crisis  in polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 coupling constant , @xmath11 , may be related ( through the axial vector coupling using the goldberger - treiman relation ) to the quark helicity contribution to the spin of the proton @xcite .",
    "therefore one can argue that @xmath11 tells us about the total spin of the nucleon carried by its constituents ; conversely , the quark contribution to the spin of the nucleon would tell us about @xmath11 .",
    "so far there is no direct experimental measurement of @xmath11 .",
    "recently , cross sections for the @xmath12 reaction near threshold have been measured by the cosy-11 @xcite and spesiii @xcite collaborations .",
    "this reaction may offer an opportunity to determine this coupling from a direct emission process of @xmath2 by a proton .",
    "of course , other production mechanisms , such as meson exchange and nucleon resonance currents , must be taken into account before a quantitative determination of @xmath13 is possible .",
    "the major aim of the present work is to explore the roles of various production mechanisms .",
    "the theory of @xmath9 production in @xmath5 collisions is still in its early stage of development @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate this reaction using a relativistic meson - exchange model of hadronic interactions . in section 2",
    "we outline the formalism for calculating the production amplitude .",
    "the final state interaction is known to play a crucial role in the production of particles near threshold energies in @xmath4 collisions @xcite ; therefore our formalism includes the @xmath5 final state interaction explicitly . the coulomb correction in the @xmath5 final state interaction is also known to be important when these protons have small energies @xcite . in the present work",
    "it is treated exactly and reduces the calculated cross section by as much as a factor of two for energies close to threshold .",
    "the initial state interaction is taken into account via a reduction factor @xcite determined from the available phase shifts and inelasticities in the threshold incident energy region . in section 3",
    "our @xmath9 meson production currents are constructed .",
    "we consider the nucleonic , mesonic and resonance currents .",
    "the roles of these currents are explored in section 4 .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the formalism used in the present work is essentially the same as that employed in refs.@xcite for studying the production of vector mesons .",
    "it is based on a relativistic meson - exchange model of hadronic interactions in which the transition amplitude is calculated in the distorted wave born approximation , taking explicitly into account effects of the final state interaction .",
    "we write the transition amplitude describing the @xmath14 process as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the four - component unperturbed @xmath5 wave function in the initial ( @xmath17 ) and final ( @xmath18 ) state .",
    "@xmath19 is the final state @xmath5 t - matrix .",
    "@xmath20 stands for the two - nucleon propagator and @xmath21 is the @xmath9-emission current defined in the next section .",
    "the t - matrix used in our calculation is generated by solving a three - dimensional reduced bethe - salpeter equation ( the blankenbecler - sugar equation ) for a relativistic one - boson - exchange @xmath4 potential @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the blankenbecler - sugar ( bbs ) two - nucleon propagator . in this work",
    "we employ a slightly modified version @xcite of the bonn b @xmath4 model as defined in table a.1 of ref.@xcite for constructing the potential @xmath22 .",
    "this modification has been made in order to reproduce the @xmath5 low - energy parameters rather than the @xmath25 low - energy parameters while preserving other features of the bonn b interaction model for describing @xmath5 scattering @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that each nucleon - nucleon - meson ( @xmath26 ) vertex in the @xmath4 potential is modified by a form factor of either monopole or dipole form .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "furthermore we note that the two - nucleon propagator @xmath20 appearing in eq.([amplitude ] ) is , for consistency , also chosen to be the bbs propagator , @xmath27 .    in eq.([amplitude ] ) the initial state interaction is neglected . for heavy meson production such as @xmath9 , its effect on the production cross sections near threshold",
    "may be taken into account by multiplying the calculated cross sections using eq.([amplitude ] ) by a factor @xcite @xmath28 ^ 2 \\label{isifactor}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 stands for the quantum numbers specifying the corresponding initial @xmath4 state and @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the corresponding @xmath4 phase - shift and inelasticity , respectively , at the nucleon incident energy .",
    "although this reduction factor is only meant to account for the gross effect of the initial state interaction , it works well when confronted with a calculation where the initial state interaction has been treated explicitly @xcite . in the near threshold energy region the relevant initial @xmath5 state is @xmath32 . for @xmath2 production",
    "the threshold incident energy is about @xmath33 .",
    "using the values @xmath34 and @xmath35 from a partial wave analysis @xcite , we obtain the reduction factor of @xmath36 for the cross section . an alternative way to account for effects of the initial state interaction is to absorb these effects in the form factors at the @xmath9 meson production vertices as has been done in refs.@xcite .",
    "we choose the former method in the present work .",
    "within our hadronic model of strong interactions , the @xmath9-emission current @xmath21 in eq.([amplitude ] ) consists of a sum of the baryonic and mesonic currents .",
    "the baryonic current is further divided into the nucleonic and nucleon resonance ( @xmath1 ) currents , so that the total current is given by @xmath37 the individual currents are illustrated diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the following subsections",
    "we construct each of these currents .",
    "the nucleonic current is defined as @xmath38 with @xmath39 denoting the @xmath10 vertex and @xmath40 the nucleon ( feynman ) propagator for nucleon @xmath41 .",
    "the summation runs over the two interacting nucleons , 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath42 stands for the meson - exchange @xmath4 potential .",
    "it is , in principle , identical to the potential @xmath22 appearing in the @xmath4 scattering equation , except that here meson retardation effects ( which are neglected in the potential entering in eq.([scateqn ] ) ) are kept as given by the feynman prescription .",
    "the structure of the @xmath10 vertex , @xmath39 , in eq.([nuc_cur ] ) is derived from the lagrangian density @xmath43 \\psi_n(x ) \\ , \\label{nnps}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath10 coupling constant and @xmath44 is the parameter controlling the pseudoscalar(ps ) - pseudovector(pv ) admixture . @xmath45 and @xmath46 stand for the @xmath9 and nucleon field , respectively ; @xmath47 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the coupling constants @xmath48 and the ps - pv mixing parameter @xmath49 are poorly known at present .",
    "the predictions for @xmath48 range anywhere from 1.9 to 7.5 @xcite ; an estimate based on the dispersion method even gives @xmath13 consistent with zero @xcite .",
    "zhang et al.@xcite in their analysis of the photoproduction on protons of @xmath2 mesons used @xmath50 for the ps - pv mixing parameter .",
    "bernard et al .",
    "@xcite , in their analysis of the @xmath8 process , extracted a value of @xmath51 in conjunction with the value of @xmath52 determined from a recent measurements of @xmath53 in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity is related to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry , together with the ozi rule @xcite , relates the @xmath54 coupling to the @xmath55 coupling : @xmath56 tan(@xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 denotes the deviation from the pseudoscalar ideal mixing angle . with the value of @xmath59 used in @xmath4 scattering analysis @xcite",
    ", we then have @xmath60 which is close to the upper end of the predicted range mentioned above . the value of @xmath59 together with the @xmath61 mixing angle of @xmath62 , as suggested by the quadratic mass formula , and the @xmath63 coupling constant of @xmath64 leads to the ratio @xmath65 .",
    "this is not too far from the value of @xmath66 extracted from a systematic analysis of semileptonic hyperon decays @xcite . in the present work we use the value of @xmath67 .",
    "we shall consider both of the extreme values of the parameter @xmath49 in eq.([nnps ] ) , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath2 is _ not _ a goldstone boson .",
    "consequently there is , _ a priori _ , no constraint on the ps - pv admixture .",
    "the @xmath54 vertex derived from eq.([nnps ] ) should be provided with an off - shell form factor .",
    "following ref.@xcite , it is assumed to be of the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the four - momentum squared of either the incoming or outgoing off - shell nucleon .",
    "we also introduce the form factor given by eq.([formfactorn ] ) at those @xmath26 vertices appearing next to the @xmath72-production vertex , where the ( intermediate ) nucleon and the exchanged mesons are off their mass shell ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding form factors are given by the product @xmath73 , where @xmath74 stands for each of the exchanged mesons between the two interacting nucleons .",
    "the form factor @xmath75 accounts for the off - shellness of the exchanged meson and is taken consistently with the @xmath4 potential used for generating the t - matrix . in ref.@xcite",
    "cutoff parameters in the range of @xmath76 have been used in the description of @xmath77- and @xmath78-meson productions in @xmath5 collisions . in order to reduce the number of free parameters , here",
    ", we adopt the value of @xmath79 , which is also the value adopted at the @xmath80 vertex in the construction of the resonance current in the next subsection .",
    "currently there are no well established nucleon resonances that decay into @xmath81 . in ref.@xcite the strong peak in the total cross section of the @xmath2 photoproduction off protons close to threshold has been attributed to the @xmath82 resonance .",
    "on the other hand , a recent multipole analysis of the @xmath2 photoproduction @xcite indicates that this reaction is dominated by an @xmath83 and a @xmath84 resonance . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "apart from the resonance dominance assumption  which probably leads to an overestimation of the total decay width of the resonances considered , it is also assumed that these resonances decay only into @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the latter decay channel also effectively accounts for all other decay channels that were not considered explicitly in the analysis due to lack of information .",
    "although this may not affect appreciably the description of the @xmath2 photoproduction reaction , the @xmath8 process can be very sensitive to such an assumption . since the pion couples strongly to the nucleon , an overestimation of the @xmath86 partial decay width is likely to lead to a considerable overestimation of the cross section due to these resonances in the @xmath8 reaction .",
    "in addition to all these uncertainties in the extraction of the resonance parameters , there is also the possibility of a threshold cusp effect , as discussed in ref.@xcite , that might explain the observed behavior of the photoproduction cross section close to threshold in the absence of any resonance .",
    "all these issues require further careful considerations . with this background in mind",
    "we will explore the role of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 resonances as determined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the resonance current , in analogy to the nucleonic current , is written as @xmath89 here @xmath90 stands for the @xmath91 vertex function involving the nucleon @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath92 is the @xmath1 resonance propagator , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 denoting the mass and width of the resonance , respectively .",
    "the summation runs over the two interacting nucleons , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and also over the resonances considered , i.e. , @xmath97 . in the above equation @xmath98 ( @xmath99 )",

    "it is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the ( feynman ) propagator of the exchanged pion with four - momentum @xmath104 and @xmath105 the @xmath106 vertex .",
    "the latter is taken consistently with the @xmath4 potential @xmath22 appearing in eq.([scateqn ] ) .",
    "we note that there is also an additional contribution to @xmath98 from the @xmath2 exchange in eq.([transpot ] ) .",
    "however this is negligible compared to the pion - exchange contribution .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the @xmath107 and @xmath108 vertices in eqs.([res_cur],[transpot ] ) are obtained from the interaction lagrangian densities @xmath109\\eta^\\prime(x)\\right\\ } \\psi_{n^*}(x ) + h.c .",

    "on - shell , both choices of the parameter @xmath49 are equivalent .",

    "we mention in advance that the interference of the resonance current with the rest of the currents ( nucleonic and mesonic currents ) is practically negligible .    in complete analogy to the nucleonic current , we introduce the off - shell form factors at each vertex involved in the resonance current .",

    "this is done following refs.@xcite , with the aid of an effective lagrangian with su(3 ) flavor symmetry and imposition of the ozi rule .",
    "the parameters of this model are the angle @xmath142 , which measures the deviation from the vector(pseudoscalar ) ideal mixing angle , and the coupling constant of the effective su(3 ) lagrangian .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "the excess energy is defined as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 denotes the total center - of - mass energy of the system and @xmath188 , its @xmath9-production threshold energy .",

    "the upper panel shows the results with @xmath189 in the @xmath80 vertices .",
    "we see that the cross section is largely dominated by the @xmath87 contribution ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the @xmath88 resonance leads to an energy dependence ( dashed line ) of the cross section steeper than that of the @xmath87 resonance , although in the excess energy region considered its contribution is practically negligible .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the total contribution , which is close to the data .",
    "the lower panel corresponds to the choice of @xmath50 at the @xmath80 vertices .",
    "compared to the case of @xmath68 , we see that the mixing parameter has practically no influence on the @xmath87 contribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that this resonance is practically on its mass shell in the near - threshold energy region , so that both choices of the parameter @xmath49 are equivalent .",
    "although still very small compared to the @xmath87 contribution , the @xmath88 resonance contribution increases substantially in the low excess energy region compared to the @xmath68 case .",
    "this is because this resonance is off - shell and the ps coupling mixes efficiently the positive and negative energy states .",
    "the pv coupling ( @xmath68 ) suppresses this mixing .",
    "the interference with the @xmath87 contribution is now destructive . in this case",
    "the total contribution ( solid curve ) is slightly reduced compared to that in the upper panel .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent analysis of @xmath2 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "we recall that the coupling constants at the @xmath80 and @xmath108 vertices entering in the resonance current have been determined from the decay widths extracted in ref.@xcite .",
    "although we find the consistency between our result above for @xmath190 and the @xmath2 photoproduction analysis of ref.@xcite , care must be taken in drawing any premature conclusions about the basic @xmath2 production mechanisms in these reactions . as mentioned in subsection iii.b , given the assumptions made in ref.@xcite in the extraction of the partial decay widths , the corresponding coupling constants , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , are subject to considerable uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the resonance dominance assumption does not allow any other possible production mechanism . as we shall show below , the vector - meson exchange current yields also a cross section comparable to the data .",
    "this indicates that the resonance current contribution shown in fig.[fig1 ] is probably overestimated .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the resonance current arises from the off - shell form factors introduced at the @xmath108 vertex .",
    "although the dominant @xmath87 resonance contribution is insensitive to the form factor at the @xmath54 vertex because the resonance is nearly on its mass shell near the threshold energy , the corresponding exchanged pion ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) is far off - shell . this makes the resonance contribution very sensitive to the form factor involving this pion . in the present calculation",
    "we have employed the same monopole form factor used at the @xmath106 vertex entering in the @xmath4 potential @xmath22 in eq.([scateqn ] ) with the cutoff parameter of @xmath124 .",
    "one might then argue that , within the resonance dominance assumption , the @xmath191 and @xmath190 processes can be described consistently  provided that one uses a soft form factor at the @xmath108 vertex . whatever the arguments , it is clear that further investigation is required in order to determine better the relevant coupling constants before a more definite conclusion can be drawn about the role of the nucleon resonance current in the @xmath8 reaction .",
    "of course one should also keep in mind the possibility that the strong peak in the cross section observed in @xmath2 photo - production close to threshold may be due to a cusp effect @xcite and _ not _ due to a resonance .",
    "we turn now to investigate the mesonic current contribution , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . among the exchange currents considered ,",
    "the @xmath192 exchange gives rise to the dominant contribution ( dashed line ) .",
    "the @xmath193- and @xmath175-exchange current contributions ( dotted and dash - dotted line , respectively ) are of similar magnitude .",
    "however they are smaller by about a factor of five compared to the @xmath192-exchange contribution .",
    "the slightly different energy dependence of the cross section resulting from the @xmath192- and @xmath193-exchange currents is due to the tensor coupling in the @xmath194 vertex .",
    "this coupling is absent in the @xmath195 vertex used here . as mentioned in subsection iii.c ,",
    "the sign of the @xmath175-exchange current relative to @xmath125-exchange currents ( @xmath196 ) is not fixed ; therefore we consider both possibilities . assuming the negative sign for @xmath197 , the interference with the @xmath125-exchange current is destructive , yielding the total contribution represented by the solid line .",
    "if @xmath197 is positive , then the interference is constructive and gives the total contribution shown by the dotted line .",
    "although this latter choice leads to an overprediction of the data , we can not exclude it at this stage because , as we shall show below , the nucleonic current can interfere destructively with the mesonic current so that the combined contribution may be smaller than that of mesonic current alone .",
    "moreover , the off - shell form factor at the @xmath2-production vertices in the mesonic current is not well - determined at present .",
    "as mentioned in subsection iii.c , we employ the same form factors at the @xmath198 and @xmath199 vertices as in the study of @xmath78- and @xmath77-meson production in @xmath5 collisions @xcite , which are themselves subject to considerable uncertainties .",
    "indeed , a reduction of about @xmath200 in the value of the cutoff parameter can bring the short - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] onto the data",
    ". therefore neither sign of @xmath197 can be excluded from the present analysis . in this regard",
    ", measurements of cross sections at higher excess energies may be useful in deciding between the two choices of the sign in the @xmath175 coupling .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the nucleonic current contribution ( dashed curve ) is shown with pv coupling at the @xmath54 vertex .",
    "the contribution from the mesonic current with the choice of positive sign for @xmath197 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is also shown here as the dash - dotted curve .",
    "as we can see , the nucleonic current is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the mesonic current .",
    "their interference is constructive and results in the total contribution shown by the solid curve , which overpredicts the data .",
    "the lower panel of fig .  [ fig4 ] shows the same results , except that ps coupling is used at the @xmath54 vertex in the nucleonic current contribution .",
    "compared to the case of pv coupling , we observe a considerable enhancement of the nucleonic current .",
    "this is due to the strong admixture of the positive and negative energy nucleon states provided by the ps coupling ; with pv coupling this mixing is suppressed .",
    "furthermore the interference with the mesonic current is now destructive , resulting in a total contribution ( solid line ) that is substantially smaller than the mesonic current contribution alone .",
    "[ fig4a ] shows the same results as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , except that here the mesonic current contribution corresponds to the choice of negative sign for @xmath197 ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we see a similar feature to that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , yielding net cross sections that underpredict the data .",
    "in particular , we see a strong destructive interference between the mesonic and nucleonic currents in the case of the ps coupling at the @xmath54 vertex ( lower panel ) .",
    "we observe that the effect of the nucleonic current may be overestimated here because we have used a rather large @xmath54 coupling constant , as discussed in subsection iii.a . in any case , given the fact that the nucleonic current is small compared to other currents , a quantitative determination of the @xmath54 coupling constant using the @xmath201 reaction is unlikely to be possible  at least not before the other dominant currents are better understood .",
    "the above considerations expose the role of individual currents as well as the current uncertainties associated with them in the description of the @xmath190 reaction .",
    "we combine now all the currents . in the following",
    "we consider all the possibilities for the mesonic - plus - nucleonic current contribution as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig4a ] . for each scenario",
    "considered we adjust the coupling constants @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the resonance current so as to reproduce the data , taking @xmath50 in the @xmath80 vertices .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for the case of the mesonic - plus - nucleonic current shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the corresponding resonance contribution is set to zero because the mesonic - plus - nucleonic current already overpredicts the data and the resonance current can only enhance the cross section further .",
    "we recall that the interference between the resonance and other currents is practically negligible .",
    "therefore we have here adjusted the ps - pv mixing parameter in the @xmath54 vertex to @xmath202 in order to reproduce the data , and the corresponding result is shown in the solid curve of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for the choice of the mesonic - plus - nucleonic current as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the resonance current is required in order to reproduce the data .",
    "we have adjusted this current contribution by multiplying the product of the coupling constants @xmath203 for both @xmath204 and @xmath88 resonances by an arbitrary reduction factor of @xmath205 .",
    "the result is shown by the dash - dotted line .",
    "for the scenario of the mesonic - plus - nucleonic current shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] , the reduction factor of the product @xmath206 required in the resonance current is @xmath207 .",
    "the corresponding result is shown by the dotted curve .",
    "finally , for the scenario of the lower panel in fig .  [ fig4a ] , no reduction of the resonance current is required in order to reproduce the data , since this corresponds to an extreme case where the destructive interference between the nucleonic and mesonic currents leads to a mesonic - plus - nucleonic current contribution that is nearly negligible . the short - dashed curve is the corresponding result .",
    "[ fig5 ] reveals the different energy dependences arising from each scenario considered .",
    "we see that if one wants to learn about the production mechanism from the total cross section then one has to go to much higher energy region than that covered by the presently available data .    at this point",
    "we note that , in view of the latter scenario discussed in fig.[fig5 ] above , it is not surprising that the approach of ref.@xcite describes the @xmath190 data . in ref.@xcite",
    "the @xmath208 amplitude , extracted from the measured cross section , has been used as the production mechanism .",
    "the @xmath208 amplitude obtained in this way must include the nucleon resonance contribution that we have considered in this work , which leads to a strong @xmath209 transtion .",
    "we emphasize , however , that one has to be careful in drawing any premature conclusion here .",
    "first , as discussed before , our nucleon resonance current is subject to considerable uncertainties .",
    "second , although the calculation of ref.@xcite is based on the measured @xmath210 cross section , it requires an introduction of an off - shell form factor at the @xmath106 vertex in order to account for the off - shellness of the exchanged pion . as we have pointed out , the exchanged pion is far off - shell in the present reaction and consequently the resulting cross sections are very sensitive to the corresponding form factor at the @xmath106 vertex .",
    "we note that in ref.@xcite a monopole form factor with the cutoff parameter of @xmath211 , as used in the bonn @xmath4 potential , has been employed .",
    "there are , however , a number of indications that the @xmath106 form factor is much softer ( @xmath212 ) than that used in the bonn potential @xcite .",
    "this would reduced the contribution of the one - pion exchange to the @xmath8 process substantially .",
    "the above consideration gives an idea of the kind of uncertanties involved in the theoretical predictions .",
    "we now focus our attention on the excess energy region close to threshold where the data exist .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the results of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in the range of excess energy up to @xmath213 . here ,",
    "only one total current contribution ( solid curve in fig .  [ fig5 ] ) is shown since all four scenarios considered lead to almost indistinguishable results at the scale used in the limited energy domain considered in the figure .",
    "we note that the energy dependence of the cross section is not reproduced .",
    "in particular , after adjusting the ps - pv mixing parameter or the reduction factor of @xmath203 in order to reproduce the higher energy data points , as has been done in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we are not able to describe the lowest two data points .",
    "we observe that the data have considerable uncertainties in the excess energy , presumably due to background subtraction that becomes more difficult for energies very close to the threshold .",
    "nevertheless the results indicate the need for some mechanism(s ) that introduces an additional energy dependence of the total cross section very close to threshold .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section near threshold is basically determined by the final state @xmath4 interaction @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which corresponds to the result calculated taking into account only the three - body phase space - plus - final state interaction ; it has been normalized to the solid curve in the low excess energy region .",
    "we see that the production currents start to modify the energy dependence given by the phase space - plus - final state interaction only for energies above @xmath214 .",
    "therefore the predicted energy dependence in the near- threshold region is unlikely to be modified by the _",
    "production mechanism(s ) .",
    "in fact , all the individual currents considered in this work lead practically to the same energy dependence in the restricted energy range considered in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "the fact that the energy dependence given by the three - body phase space - plus - final state interaction does not reproduce the observed energy dependence in @xmath215 process has been a subject of attention since the publication of the cosy-11 data @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the measured cross section data for @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath2 production in @xmath5 collisions together with the corresponding energy dependence predicted by the phase space - plus - final state interaction only ( solid curves ) . apart from the fact that in @xmath2 production the deviation starts a little lower in excess energy than in @xmath216 production , we see no indication for any peculiar feature in @xmath2 production .",
    "the most trivial source of influence on the energy dependence of the cross section close to threshold is the coulomb force @xcite , which has not been considered so far in our calculations .",
    "we follow the gell - mann and goldberger two - potential formalism @xcite to include the coulomb force in the final state interaction .",
    "the perturbed wave function is calculated exactly by solving the schrdinger equation in coordinate space with the nuclear - plus - coulomb potential . for the nuclear potential we use the paris potential @xcite .",
    "the half - off - shell ( pure ) coulomb t - matrix is obtained in analytic form @xcite .",
    "we note that care must be taken in order to use consistently a @xmath4 t - matrix constructed within a non - relativistic formulation  such as the paris t - matrix  in a relativistic approach .",
    "we have followed ref.@xcite in order to use the paris t - matrix in the present relativistic approach .",
    "also , in the following , the production current has been kept the same as that used in conjunction with the bonn b potential , except for a readjustment of the reduction factor of the product @xmath218 in the nucleon resonance current that was needed to reproduce the data .",
    "we are aware that by using the paris potential instead of the bonn b potential we may loose the consistency between the production current and the final state interaction , however the energy dependence of the cross section is practically the same  when the coulomb force is switched off  as that given by the bonn b potential over a wide range of excess energy .",
    "the result of including the coulomb effect as described above is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] by the solid line .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the result when the coulomb force is switched off .",
    "as can be seen , the coulomb effect is considerable ; in particular , it reduces the cross section by almost @xmath219 at @xmath220 .",
    "the picture that emerges from the above considerations is that there is no obvious indication of a need for other mechanisms than those already considered here in order adequately to describe the existing data .",
    "a close comparison of the cosy-11 @xcite and spesiii @xcite data , however , seems to indicate different trends in the energy dependence . in this connection ,",
    "new measurements at higher energies , and even remeasurement of some of the data near @xmath221 , are extremely important for resolution of this issue",
    ". the new data at higher energies will certainly impose more stringent constraints on the parameters of our model .",
    "they would also tell us whether a proper description of the @xmath190 requires the inclusion of the @xmath85 final state interaction , as has been argued recently  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath85 final state interaction as discussed in ref.@xcite can be viewed as the higher order terms in the production current treated in the present work .",
    "in fact , the @xmath9-emission current defined in the previous section ( cf .",
    "eqs.([nuc_cur],[res_cur],[mec_cur ] ) ) is , in part , just the born term of a more general current that can be obtained by using the t - matrix amplitude for the @xmath222 transition , where @xmath74 denotes any meson of interest .",
    "this can easily be seen if we disregard the nucleon labeled 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; the current then becomes nothing other than the born term of the @xmath223 transition amplitude .",
    "the t - matrix amplitude for the @xmath224 process may be separated into the so - called pole and non - pole terms according to pearce and afnan @xcite . by using the physical baryon mass and physical @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) and @xmath26 vertices in the baryonic current ,",
    "the pole term of the @xmath227 t - matrix amplitude is fully accounted for in the present work .",
    "what is taken in the born approximation is , therefore , the non - pole part of the t - matrix only .",
    "we have investigated the reaction @xmath8 within a relativistic meson - exchange model of hadronic interactions .",
    "we find that the @xmath87 resonance as determined in a recent multipole analysis of @xmath2 photoproduction @xcite gives rise to a contribution that reproduces the measured cross section and allows for no other production mechanisms .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of ref.@xcite , where the nucleon resonance parameters have been extracted under the resonance dominance assumption .",
    "whether this is already the entire physics of the production mechanism is an open question that requires further investigation .",
    "indeed , in ref.@xcite , in addition to the assumption of resonance dominance , only the @xmath85 and @xmath86 decay channels have been explicitly considered ; the @xmath86 decay channel accounts for _ all _ possible decay channels other than the @xmath85 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath80 and @xmath108 obtained from the decay widths extracted under these assumptions are , therefore , subject to considerable uncertainties which , in turn , lead to corresponding uncertainties in the resonance current contribution to the cross section . a more accurate determination of the relevant resonance parameters is called for before a more definite conclusion can be drawn about the role of the @xmath1 resonances in the @xmath8 reaction .",
    "we should also keep in mind that the strong peak in the cross section close to threshold in @xmath2 photoproduction may be due to a cusp effect @xcite , and not to the resonance assumed in ref.@xcite .",
    "all these issues associated with the resonance require further careful investigation .",
    "the mesonic current gives rise to cross sections which are comparable to the measured values .",
    "it is dominated by the @xmath192-exchange current .",
    "depending on the choice of the sign of the @xmath175 coupling constant , the calculated cross sections overpredict or underpredict the data .",
    "however neither choice can be excluded at present  mainly due to uncertainties associated with the baryonic current .",
    "data in higher energy regions than currently available may provide the necessary constraint to fix the sign of this coupling , as the different signs lead to different energy dependences .",
    "since the nucleonic current is found to be small , it is unlikely that the @xmath201 reaction can be used quantitatively to determine the @xmath54 coupling constant  at least not before the other dominant currents are under better control .    as expected from earlier calculations",
    "@xcite , the coulomb force in the final state interaction is found to play a crucial role in explaining the observed energy dependence of the cross section close to threshold .",
    "the basic production mechanisms start to influence the energy dependence of the cross section only for excess energies above @xmath228 . for lower energies",
    "the energy dependence is determined by the three - body phase space - plus - final state interaction @xcite .",
    "new data at higher energies will certainly impose constraints on the production mechanisms .",
    "in addition to more exclusive observables than the total cross section , a combined analysis of production processes using both electromagnetic and hadronic probes should help to disentangle the different production mechanisms .",
