    "nowadays simulation of quantum systems is developed to a high extent ( see , _ e.g. _ , reviews @xcite ) . however ,",
    "common simulation methods , for example , path integral monte carlo or wigner dynamics , use non - positively defined functions ( wave function , the wigner function , _ etc . _ ) to describe a quantum state .",
    "this leads to the difficulties with convergence of corresponding integrals , especially harmful for the simulation of fermi systems ( sign problem ) .",
    "there is a hope that using a real nonnegative function , describing the quantum state , one can avoid these difficulties .",
    "the real nonnegative function in the phase space , completely describing the quantum state , was proposed 60 years ago ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . during the last decade",
    "another very interesting representation has been actively developed : the quantum tomography , operating with the ensemble of _ scaled and rotated reference frames _ , instead of the phase space @xcite . in the framework of this formalism the state - describing function ( called marginal distribution or quantum tomogram ) is real and nonnegative .",
    "the advantage is that the quantum tomogram is a _ probability distribution _ shown to completely describe the quantum state @xcite .",
    "it is one of the reasons why the quantum tomography has become so popular .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method for computer simulation of nonstationary quantum processes based on the tomography representation of quantum mechanics and illustrate it considering the problem of nonstationary tunneling of a wave packet .",
    "many simulation approaches in nonstationary quantum mechanics are based on the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "there are also methods using the ensembles of classical trajectories to simulate quantum evolution .",
    "for example , the method of `` wigner trajectories '' , based on the wigner representation @xcite , is well known ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , review @xcite for details ) and was recently successfully applied to investigate the tunneling of a wave packet @xcite .",
    "using such trajectories , one does not have to store the large arrays representing , say , the wave function ( contrary to grid methods ) , therefore there is a gain in computer memory .",
    "the quantum tomogram @xmath0 depends on the variables @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the coordinates and momenta of the system , respectively , @xmath4 are the parameters of scaling and rotation of reference frame in the phase space .",
    "the quantum tomogram is nonnegative and normalized in @xmath5 direction , therefore it can be interpreted as a distribution function of the value @xmath5 . in our method",
    "the ensemble of trajectories in space @xmath1 is introduced to describe the quantum evolution .",
    "the trajectories are governed by the dynamical equations obtained from the evolution equation for the quantum tomogram .",
    "we demonstrate the method considering the nonstationary tunneling of a wave packet through the potential barrier . for this problem we calculated tunneling times , which are of interest nowadays , both for basic science ( _ e.g. _ ,",
    "what is the time spent by an atom to tunnel from the trap ? ) and for applications ( electronic tunneling time is connected with the operation rate of some nanostructure - based devices ) .",
    "we also analyzed the evolution of the wave packet in coordinate and momentum spaces in details .",
    "another demonstration was designed to show that our method is not restricted to one - particle simulations .",
    "namely , we investigated the tunneling of a wave packet of composite quasiparticle , an exciton ( coupled electron and hole in semiconductor ) , in a one - dimensional nanostructure ( quantum wire ) . in this case",
    "we had two degrees of freedom .",
    "for this problem , in addition to the probability density evolution , we determined the probability of ionization due to electron and hole scattering on the barrier in different directions .    in sec .",
    "[ method ] we present description of the method , in sec .",
    "[ tunneling ] describe the model problem and main results for a wave packet tunneling .",
    "exciton tunneling is considered in sec .",
    "[ exciton ] and the work is summarized in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the quantum tomogram @xmath6 is connected with the density matrix @xmath7 as @xcite : @xmath8    consider the case of the particle with mass @xmath9 in one - dimensional space .",
    "if the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath10 then the integral transformation ( [ dmtow ] ) applied to the time - dependent evolution equation for the density matrix gives @xcite @xmath11 where we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 is given by @xmath14    eq.([evt ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath15 where functions @xmath16 depend on quantum tomogram , its derivatives and antiderivatives ( the latter corresponding to terms with @xmath17 in eq.([evt ] ) ) .",
    "generalization for the case of more variables is straightforward because the form of the equations does not change .",
    "functions @xmath16 for the problem under investigation are given in sec .",
    "[ tunneling ] .",
    "the evolution equation rewritten as ( [ conteqxmunu ] ) has the form of continuity equation for the quantum tomogram @xmath18 this equation is analogous to the continuity equation for classical distribution function and liouville equation .",
    "as known , the characteristics of liouville equation are the classical trajectories in phase space and they obey hamilton equations of motion . the quantum tomogram is nonnegative and we use it as a distribution function for trajectories in the space @xmath19 , obeying the equations analogous to hamilton equations for the classical trajectories . from the comparison of eq.([conteqxmunu ] ) with eq.([conteq ] ) it is obvious that the trajectories are governed by the equations @xmath20    the trajectories are used to avoid the direct calculations of the distribution function ( contrary to grid methods where the wave function is calculated at every point to solve numerically schrdinger equation ) . hence it is necessary to use some approximation for the quantum tomogram and we use local exponential approximation ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite for the wigner function ) : @xmath21 } ,   \\label{tloca}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the point under consideration",
    ". parameters of this approximation are matrix @xmath24 and vector @xmath25 , and some combinations of these parameters enter the evolution equation ( [ evt ] ) , instead of the derivatives and antiderivatives of the quantum tomogram . calculation of average @xmath26 and their average products allows to obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "after that , functions @xmath16 are known and dynamical equations ( [ eqmotiong ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we use the local approximation ( [ tloca ] ) only for the calculation of r.h.s . in the equations of motion ( [ eqmotiong ] ) .",
    "the use of ensemble of trajectories to represent the quantum tomogram means the approximation of quantum tomogram as a set of delta - functions , each delta - function corresponds to one trajectory .",
    "if the number of trajectories approaches infinity , the quantum tomogram can be approximated by the set of delta - functions with arbitrary precision .",
    "this is analogous to what is conventionally done in classical statistical mechanics for the distribution function in phase space .",
    "but unlike the classical statistical mechanics now the trajectories are not independent : the approximation ( [ tloca ] ) is used to take the non - local character of quantum - mechanical evolution into account .",
    "the validity of this approximation holds if the quantum tomogram is smooth and the trajectories are close to each other . for example",
    ", this approximation can fail if one tries to consider a plain wave with wave vector @xmath27 : in this case @xmath28 .",
    "approximation ( [ tloca ] ) also works not well for unbounded motion , because the trajectories scatter with time .",
    "if there are few trajectories in the region around the given point , then the approximation ( [ tloca ] ) will not reconstruct the quantum tomogram well , due to lack of statistics .",
    "we consider the tunneling of wave packets through the barrier , and comparing our results with exact quantum computation we see that approximation ( [ tloca ] ) holds for this problem ( see secs .",
    "[ tunneling],[exciton ] ) .",
    "for example , considering the tunneling through the potential barrier from the well , we deal with both the region of bounded motion ( in the well ) and unbounded motion ( beyond the barrier ) , still the approximation works not bad ( sec .  [ tunneling ] ) . for higher initial energy the penetration through",
    "the barrier is higher , and the evolution of most trajectories corresponds to unbounded motion , then the validity of eq.([tloca ] ) becomes poorer ( see the end of sec .",
    "[ tunneling ] ) , in agreement with the discussion above .",
    "but in general local approximation ( [ tloca ] ) works satisfactory even for quite long time intervals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    to obtain any information about the system",
    ", we have to calculate some average values .",
    "consider an arbitrary operator @xmath29 .",
    "average value @xmath30 of corresponding physical quantity is calculated in the tomographic representation of quantum mechanics as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier component of the weyl symbol @xmath33 of operator @xmath29 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) : @xmath34    for the calculation of average values we use the following approximation of quantum tomogram : @xmath35 where the summation is made over all @xmath36 trajectories ; @xmath37 are the coordinates of the @xmath38-th trajectory in @xmath1 space at time @xmath39 .",
    "such approximation corresponds to use of the ensemble of trajectories . in the regions , where @xmath6 is small , trajectories are rare , and where it is large , trajectories are accumulated .",
    "the more trajectories are used , the better the approximation ( [ tomap ] ) works . if during the simulation the wave function has the form of a compact wave packet , even consisting of several distinct parts , approximation ( [ tomap ] ) holds , because in this case one has the compact sets of trajectories providing good statistics .",
    "this is the case for problems considered , and therefore the use of this approximation does not change results essentially , in comparison with the exact quantum computation ( secs .",
    "[ tunneling],[exciton ] )",
    ".    for the operators @xmath40 , depending on @xmath41 only , expression for @xmath30 takes the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the function corresponding to the operator @xmath40 in coordinate representation , @xmath44 .",
    "the method of calculation of an average @xmath45 at arbitrary time @xmath39 , with the approximation ( [ tomap ] ) , is quite simple .",
    "one just takes into account the trajectories with any @xmath5 and with @xmath46 from the small region near @xmath47 only , and performs a summation of @xmath43 over all such trajectories .",
    "the developed method is similar to well - known method of wigner trajectories ( see @xcite for review ) , where the ensemble of trajectories is introduced in the phase space , with the wigner function used as a quasi - distribution function",
    ". the quantum tomogram is defined in the space @xmath1 , that is not as simple for understanding as the phase space used in the wigner approach . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum tomogram is true distribution function , while the wigner function can be both positive and negative . in spite of these differences the two approaches",
    "are quite close in general , and there are some difficulties common for both methods . the discussion ( see above ) of the approximation for the tomogram ( such as ( [ tloca ] ) ) concerns , in principle , the method of wigner trajectories either .",
    "another important example is the discontinuity of the wigner trajectories discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is due to the fact that the trajectories are not independent as in classical statistical mechanics , their evolution depends on their local distribution .",
    "the same is applicable for the quantum tomography approach , where the trajectories are also not independent for the same reason . in ref .",
    "@xcite a possible alternative to wigner function was proposed .",
    "namely , in that work the authors proposed to use the weyl transforms of some operators ( the wigner function , up to the constant , is the weyl transform of the density operator ) instead of the wigner function to generate the ensemble of trajectories .",
    "the same can be introduced for the quantum tomography . applying the transform ( [ dmtow ] ) to the matrix elements of an operator @xmath48 we obtain the symbol @xmath49 .",
    "this function is not nonnegative in general , but in analogy with the wigner trajectories one can use @xmath49 to develop some new ensemble of trajectories .",
    "probably , as with the weyl transforms trajectories @xcite , it will be more convenient to use the trajectories corresponding to @xmath50 in certain cases .",
    "of course , this problem needs further investigation .",
    "we choose the external potential to coincide with the potential used in @xcite , for comparison of the results of simulation in quantum tomography approach with those obtained by other methods .",
    "we consider behavior of the wave packet in one - dimensional space in external potential @xmath51 as the potential has only the second and third powers of coordinate , all its derivatives of order more than the third vanish .",
    "evolution equation in this case has the form ( @xmath12 ) : @xmath52w = 0   \\label{evtx23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the potential given by eq.([vext ] ) evolution equation reads as : @xmath53 and dynamical equations have the form @xmath54    we use atomic units throughout , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the mass and charge of a free electron .",
    "the particle with mass @xmath58 is regarded .",
    "parameters of the potential are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this potential has the minimum at @xmath61 @xmath62 and maximum at @xmath63 @xmath64 , therefore here we consider the motion of a particle in the potential well with infinite left wall and the barrier of height @xmath65 at @xmath63 .",
    "this model problem roughly describes nonstationary tunneling of an atom from the trap .",
    "initially the particle represented by the wave packet is situated to the left from @xmath61 , its mean momentum is zero .",
    "the particle can oscillate in the potential well and can tunnel or pass above the barrier .",
    "the probabilities of these processes depend on the initial energy of the wave packet .",
    "we consider the problem , where all parameters , except the initial mean coordinate @xmath66 of the wave packet , are fixed ( initial mean momentum equals zero , dispersions of the wave packet in coordinate and momentum spaces are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively ) .",
    "we solve the equations ( [ eqmotionm ] ) numerically .",
    "as in @xcite we consider three values of @xmath66 : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the most interesting quantities characterizing tunneling are reaction probability and tunneling time .",
    "reaction probability is defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( the point where potential has the maximum ) , the maximum value of reaction probability is unity .",
    "reaction probability shows what part of the wave packet is currently beyond the barrier .",
    "tunneling time of the wave packet is also an important feature of tunneling .",
    "there are a lot of methods to determine tunneling time @xcite .",
    "we use the approach where tunneling time is calculated as the difference of _ presence times _ ( see @xcite for review ) at point @xmath73 and @xmath74 , located on the opposite sides of the barrier : @xmath75 the presence time at arbitrary point @xmath76 is @xmath77      here we present the results obtained by means of our method and compare them with the exact numerical solution of schrdinger equation . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the dependence of reaction probability ( [ reactprob ] ) on time for three values of initial mean coordinate of the wave packet @xmath78 and @xmath70 , corresponding mean energies of the wave packet are @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "solid lines represent the results of simulation in the quantum tomography approach ( qt ) and dashed lines correspond to the numerical solution of schrdinger equation ( exact quantum computation ) . due to the increase of initial mean energy with the increase of @xmath82 , the portion of high energy components in the wave packet grows .",
    "this leads to the higher portion of components , which pass through the barrier , either because their energy is greater than the height of the barrier , or due to tunneling .",
    "therefore , with the growth of @xmath82 , reaction probability becomes larger and one can see that the curves corresponding to different @xmath66 are above each other in fig .",
    "the time evolution of reaction probability is qualitatively the same for every @xmath66 .",
    "the components , which have passed through the barrier , can not return , because for @xmath83 potential diminishes with the growth of coordinate , and so reaction probability can not decrease with time .",
    "at first it grows rapidly due to transmission of components with the energy higher than the height of the barrier ( comparison with the classical solution of corresponding problem , for which only transmission above the barrier is possible , convinces us in it ) .",
    "then reaction probability continues to grow slowly , because of the tunneling .",
    "all these features present both for qt simulation and for exact quantum computation .    the dimensionless reaction probabilities ( [ reactprob ] ) for three values of initial mean coordinate of the wave packet : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath70 a.u .",
    "solid lines are for the simulation in quantum tomography approach , dashed lines are for the exact numerical solution.,height=264 ]    in comparison with the exact computation , reaction probability for the qt simulation is slightly higher .",
    "note also some difference in the character of increase of the reaction probability for qt simulation and exact solution : in the former case the curves are not so smooth .",
    "these differences are due to the finite number of trajectories used in qt simulation : for smaller number of trajectories ( not shown ) reaction probability curves resemble staircase more evidently ( this is connected with the overestimation of the role of wave packet oscillations in the well for the finite number of trajectories ) , and quantitative deviation from exact result is stronger .",
    "but in general , for quite large number of trajectories , as for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , qt simulation results on reaction probability are quite close to those obtained through the exact quantum computation ( compare also with the method of `` wigner trajectories '' in the work by donoso and martens @xcite ) .      besides the reaction probability we also obtained a number of new qualitative and quantitative results , which described in details the behavior of the wave packet during tunneling .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) but the interaction with the barrier changes its form more substantially ( @xmath89 and @xmath95 , figs .",

    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] , at times @xmath86 and @xmath90 , respectively . as the wave function is initially the gaussian wave packet , the initial distributions both in coordinate and momentum space are gaussian ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "but after the wave packet has interacted with the barrier , the distribution in momentum space changes substantially ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . the higher the energy of incident particle , the greater the tunneling probability",
    ". therefore the barrier transmits mainly the wave packet components with relatively high energy , serving as an energy selector . components with high momentum arise , as the transmitted part of the wave packet is accelerated in the region of lowering potential beyond the barrier , and we observe the enriching of the wave packet by high energy components .",
    "the resemblance between the histograms ( qt simulation ) and smooth solid lines ( exact solution ) is somewhat poorer for momentum distribution at large times ( @xmath90 , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) than for coordinate distribution ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that one deals with finite number of trajectories and has to sample quite large interval in momentum space , because the transmitted part is permanently accelerated .",

    "tunneling is usually stronger for the higher energy .",
    "therefore , the increase of @xmath82 ( and corresponding increase of initial mean energy ) leads to the growth of the average speed both of the transmitted part and of the wave packet as a whole .",
    "the transmitted part passes the region of the barrier ( the space between the points @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) faster , and",
    "so one expects that the increase of @xmath82 causes the decrease of tunneling time .",

    "results of qt simulation ( squares in fig",
    ".  [ fig7 ] ) deviate from those of exact computation ( circles ) within the range of errors .",
    "the deviation is maximal for large @xmath82 .",
    "probably , this is because for large @xmath82 the wave packet leaves the well almost entirely ( see fig .",

    "[ method ] can be used to simulate the evolution of systems with more than one degree of freedom . in this section",
    "we demonstrate such a possibility , considering nonstationary tunneling of the composite particle , exciton , through the potential barrier in one - dimensional ( 1d ) semiconductor structure ( quantum wire ) .",

    "using femtosecond laser pulses , we can form an excitonic wave packet , either by the quasiresonance pumping , or exciting an electron from valence band with formation of a hole and subsequent binding of two particles into exciton .",
    "then the excitonic wave packet can move to the barrier and with the help of some detectors one can investigate scattering of the exciton .    keeping this in mind let us construct the model for the simulation .",
    "we use the constants corresponding to gaas for reference ( dielectric constant @xmath103 , effective masses of electron and hole are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , where @xmath106 is the electron mass in vacuum ) .",
    "3d exciton in bulk gaas is characterized by effective bohr radius @xmath107 and binding energy @xmath108 .",

    "corresponding units of energy and time are @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the energy spectrum and wave functions of relative electron and hole motion in 3d exciton are analogous to those of hydrogen atom . but",
    "this is not the case for 1d exciton .",
    "first , electron - hole effective interaction potential in quasi-1d structure is not coulomb . indeed , if the exciton size in the direction of allowed motion is much greater than the width of the quantum wire ( in the transverse direction ) , then the adiabatic approximation is applicable and 3d interaction potential must be averaged over the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "resulting 1d effective potential substantially differs from coulomb ( see @xcite for the discussion of similar model ) .",
    "second , corresponding energy spectrum and wave functions of electron and hole relative motion also change in comparison with the hydrogen - like states .",
    "we choose the wave function of the exciton ground state in gaussian form .",
    "excitonic wave packet can be represented as a gaussian wave packet in center - of - mass coordinates : @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are electron and hole coordinates , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are parameters ; for them we used the following values : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "external potential is assumed to be zero everywhere except the region of barrier ; we use the barrier of thickness equal to @xmath124 , or @xmath125 in accepted units . for simplicity we set the barriers for electron and hole to be the same and use both external and interaction potentials in quadratic form , cut at some distance .",

    "thus we choose the radius of electron - hole interaction to be @xmath132 .",
    "we assume that we deal with a quasi-1d exciton with binding energy @xmath133 .",
    "in fact , for an exciton in quantum wire , the wave function , binding energy , etc . ,",
    "are essentially influenced by the properties of quantum wire .",
    "we also neglect the possibility of electron and hole recombination at the time scales studied .    here",
    "we consider just an example , therefore use relatively simple model .",
    "still this model contains the main features of exciton tunneling , such as the possibility of ionization , barrier and interaction with realistic strength and size , the fact that composite particle is the bounded state of two particles .    for stationary state",

    "[ fig2 ]  -[fig6 ] , here we show the results of several combined qt simulation runs , therefore corresponding lines are relatively smooth . coincidence of qt and exact computation results , initially very good , becomes poorer with time ( figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] ) , but qt simulation reproduces main properties of exciton tunneling : wave packets broadening with time and due to interaction with the barrier , shrinking near the barrier , dividing into two parts ( reflected and transmitted ) . note that qt results are quite close to exact ones even for long times ( @xmath147 ) , despite the fact that the motion is unbounded ( see sec .  [ method ] ) .",
    "integral values ( in fig",
    ".  [ fig10 ] ) obtained in qt approach also agree with the exact results .",
    "larger discrepancies correspond to higher barriers , probably due to larger inaccuracies , introduced by neglecting the potential discontinuity in the case of stronger interaction with the external potential .",
    "the electron and hole wave packets begin the motion from the point @xmath149 and , shrinking near the barrier , are partially reflected and transmitted . for the case presented in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ]  -   [ fig9 ] about the half of wave packets is transmitted .",
    "interesting is the question about the ionization probability of exciton , induced by interaction with the barrier .",
    "if electron and hole are scattered in different directions on the barrier , the distance between them can become quite large , but , in principle , there is a possibility that exciton is not ionized after such scattering , because one of the particles can be pulled beyond the barrier , to the other particle , due to electron - hole attraction . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron - hole interaction is cut at the distance @xmath150 in our model .",
    "after the interaction with the barrier the wave packet divides into reflected and transmitted parts moving in opposite directions . for the time large enough , these two parts are well separated , the separation between them grows and the leakage through the barrier in both directions is negligible . denote the probability of ionization due to electron and hole scattering in different directions as @xmath148 .",
    "then , the probability to find electron and hole in different directions in respect to the barrier , with e - h distance being larger than @xmath150 , approaches @xmath148 in the limit @xmath151 .",
    "the probability of ionization due to electron and hole scattering in different directions on the barrier @xmath148 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , depending on the barrier height @xmath127 .",
    "for very high and very low barriers @xmath148 must approach zero , because in former case both particles are reflected and in the latter they both are transmitted .",
    "this trend is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , and @xmath148 depending on @xmath127 is maximal ( other parameters are fixed , see above ) at @xmath152 .",
    "note that these features are obvious for curves representing both qt simulation ( circles ) and exact computation ( squares ) , and in general two curves are quite close to each other .",
    "we have developed the new method of numerical simulation of quantum nonstationary processes and applied it to the problem of tunneling of the wave packet through the potential barrier .",
    "the method is based on tomographic representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the quantum tomogram is used in a sense as the distribution function for the ensemble of trajectories in space @xmath153 , where @xmath2 is the coordinate measured in rotated and scaled reference frame , @xmath3 are coordinate and momentum of the system , respectively .",
    "the trajectories are governed by the equations , resembling the hamilton equations of motion , therefore , some analogue of molecular dynamics can be used .",
    "the gaussian approximation allows to avoid the direct calculation of quantum tomogram . instead of quantum tomogram ,",
    "the parameters of the approximation are used in the equations of motion .",
    "those parameters can be obtained if one calculates the local moments of the ensemble of the trajectories .",
    "the problem of nonstationary tunneling of the wave packet was considered .",
    "our method gave the results in agreement with those obtained by the method of `` wigner trajectories '' and by exact quantum computation .",
    "of course , we made only the first step in the development of this simulation method , having considered one - dimensional problem .",
    "but it is obvious that the generalization for the case of several dimensions is straightforward . in this case",
    "the method possesses the additional advantage of more rapid convergence due to the fact the quantum tomogram is nonnegative .",
    "this may help to overcome the problem of sign for fermionic systems . in the next work",
    "we intend to consider the many - body problem for fermionic and bosonic systems by means of the quantum tomography method .",
    "the similar approach ( in the framework of `` wigner trajectories '' ) has been already applied for the investigation of the tunneling of two identical particles @xcite .",
