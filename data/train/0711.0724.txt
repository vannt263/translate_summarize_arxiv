    "it is widely known that the currently available experimental techniques ( and , apparently , those which will become avaiable in the nearest future ) in the area of quantum physics as a whole and in that of quantum computations in particular , as well as the present level of understanding of phenomenological models , outstripped the actual level of mathematical / theoretical description@xcite .",
    "considering , for example , the problem of describing the realizable states ( refs .  ",
    ") , one should not expect that planar waves and ( squeezed ) gaussian coherent states would be enough to characterize such complex systems as qcpu ( quantum central processor unit)-like devices .",
    "complexity of the set of relevant states , including entangled ( chaotic ) states is still far from being clearly understood and moreover from being realizable . as a starting point for our approach",
    "let us consider the following well - known example of gkp ( gottesman , kitaev , preskill)@xcite scheme with dv ( discrete variables)/qubit ( with finite - dimensional code space embedded in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space ) or cv ( continuous variables ) for ( optical ) quantum computations , containing as a part ( optical ) nonlinearities , described by kerr interaction or more general polynomial hamiltonians which are needed to realize the state preparation and provide the process of cv quantum computation@xcite .",
    "it is an important example because :    * ( a ) * its classical counterpart is described by polynomial hamiltonians ;    * ( b ) * the proper qudits or building states ( dv or cv ) are well localized ( but not well - defined mathematically , as we shall explain later ) .",
    "one of the questions which motivated our approach is whether it is possible to keep * ( a ) * and at the same time improve * ( b)*. our other motivations arise from the following general questions :    * ( a ) * how can we represent well localized and reasonable state in mathematically correct form ?    * ( b ) * is it possible to create entangled and other relevant states by means of these new building blocks ?    in gkp scheme unphysical and",
    "not clearly defined mathematically logical qubit states are represented via infinite series of @xmath0 functions : @xmath1 and approximated by the set of gaussian envelopes : @xmath2 , @xmath3    due to numerous mathematical and computational reasons , some of which are described below , such and related choices can not be appropriate neither as a starting point on the route to the real qcpu device nor as a satisfactory theoretical description .",
    "so , it would appear that a first step in this direction is to find a reasonable extension of understanding of the quantum dynamics as a whole .",
    "one needs to sketch up the underlying ingredients of the theory ( spaces of states , observables , measures , classes of smoothness , quantization set - up etc ) in an attempt to provide the maximally extendable but at the same time really calculable and realizable description of the dynamics of quantum world .",
    "the general idea is rather simple : it is well known that the idea of `` symmetry '' is the key ingredient of any reasonable physical theory from classical ( in)finite dimensional ( integrable ) hamiltonian dynamics to different sub - planckian models based on strings ( branes , orbifolds etc . ) during the last century kinematical , dynamical and hidden symmetries played the key role in our understanding of physical process .",
    "roughly speaking , the representation theory of underlying symmetry ( classical or quantum , groups or ( bi)algebras , finite or infinite dimensional , continuous or discrete ) is a proper instrument for description of proper ( orbital ) dynamics .",
    "a starting point for us is a possible model for ( continuous ) `` qudit '' with subsequent description of the whole zoo of possible realizable ( controllable ) states / patterns which may be useful from the point of view of quantum experimentalists and engineers .",
    "the proper representation theory is well known as `` local nonlinear harmonic analysis '' , in particular case of simple underlying symmetry ",
    "affine group  aka wavelet analysis .",
    "from our point of view the advantages of such approach are as follows :    * i ) * natural realization of localized states in any proper functional realization of ( hilbert ) space of states ,    * ii ) * hidden symmetry of chosen realization of proper functional model provides the ( whole ) spectrum of possible states via the so - called multiresolution decomposition .",
    "so , indeed , the hidden symmetry ( non - abelian affine group in the simplest case ) of the space of states via proper representation theory generates the physical spectrum and this procedure depends on the choice of the functional realization of the space of states .",
    "it explicitly demonstrates that the structure and properties of the functional realization of the space of states are the natural properties of physical world at the same level of importance as a particular choice of hamiltonian , or the equation of motion , or the action principle ( variational method ) . at the next step",
    "we need to consider the consequences of our choice i ) , ii ) for the algebra of observables . in this direction",
    "one needs to mention the class of operators we are interested in to present proper description for a class of maximally generalized but reasonable class of problems .",
    "it seems that these must be pseudodifferential operators , especially if we underline that in the spirit of points i ) , ii ) above we need to take wigner - weyl framework for constructing basic quantum equations of motions .",
    "it is obvious , that consideration of symbols of operators instead of operators themselves is the starting point as for the mathematical theory of pseudodifferential operators as for quantum dynamics formulated in the language of wigner - like equations .",
    "it should be noted that in such picture we can naturally include the effects of self - interaction ( `` quantum non - linearity '' ) on the way of construction and subsequent analysis of nonlinear quantum models .",
    "so , our consideration will be in the framework of ( nonlinear ) pseudodifferential dynamics ( @xmath4 ) . as a result of i ) , ii ) , we ll have :    * iii ) * most sparse , almost diagonal , representation for a wide class of operators included in the set - up of the whole problems .",
    "it s possible by using the so - called fast wavelet transform representation for algebra of observables .",
    "then points i)iii ) provide us by    * iv ) * natural ( non - perturbative ) multiscale decomposition for all dynamical quantities , as states as observables .    the simplest case we will have , obviously , in wigner - weyl representation .",
    "existence of such internal multiscales with different dynamics at each scale and transitions , interactions , and intermittency between scales demonstrates that quantum mechanics , despite its linear structure , is really a serious part of physics from the mathematical point of view .",
    "it seems , that well - known underlying quantum complexity is a result of transition by means of ( still rather unclear ) procedure of quantization from complexity related to nonlinearity of classical counterpart to the rich pseudodifferential ( more exactly , microlocal ) structure on the quantum side .",
    "we divide all possible configurations related to possible solutions of our quantum equation of motion ( wigner - like equations , mostly ) into two classes :    * ( a ) * standard solutions ; * ( b ) * controllable solutions ( solutions with prescribed qualitative type of behaviour ) .",
    "anyway , the whole zoo of solutions consists of possible patterns , including very important ones from the point of view of underlying physics :    * v ) * localized modes ( basis modes , eigenmodes ) and constructed from them chaotic or entangled , decoherent ( if we change wigner equation for ( master ) lindblad one ) patterns .",
    "it should be noted that these bases modes are nonlinear in contrast with usual ones because they come from ( non ) abelian generic group while the usual fourier ( commutative ) analysis starts from @xmath5 abelian modes ( plane waves ) .",
    "they are really `` eigenmodes '' but in sense of decomposition of representation of the underlying hidden symmetry group which generates the multiresolution decomposition .",
    "the set of patterns is built from these modes by means of variational procedures more or less standard in mathematical physics .",
    "it allows to control the convergence from one side but , what is more important ,    * vi ) * to consider the problem of the control of patterns ( types of behaviour ) on the level of reduced ( variational ) algebraical equations .",
    "we need to mention that it is possible to change the simplest generic group of hidden internal symmetry from the affine ( translations and dilations ) to much more general , but , in any case , this generic symmetry will produce the proper natural high localized eigenmodes , as well as the decomposition of the functional realization of space of states into the proper orbits ; and all that allows to compute dynamical consequence of this procedure , i.e. pattern formation , and , as a result , to classify the whole spectrum of proper states",
    ".    for practical reasons controllable patterns ( with prescribed behaviour ) are the most useful .",
    "we mention the so - called waveleton - like pattern which we regard as the most important one .",
    "we use the following allusion in the space of words :    \\{waveleton}:=\\{soliton } @xmath6 \\{wavelet }    it means :    * vii ) * waveleton @xmath7 ( meta)stable localized ( controllable ) pattern    to summarize , the approach described below allows one    * viii ) * to solve wide classes of general @xmath4 problems , including generic for quantum physics wigner - like equations , and    * ix ) * to present the analytical / numerical realization for physically interesting patterns .",
    "we would like to emphasize the effectiveness of numerical realization of this program ( minimal complexity of calculations ) as additional advantage .",
    "so , items i)-ix ) point out all main features of our approach , refs .  .",
    "here we describe a class of problems which can be analysed by methods described in introduction .",
    "we start from individual dynamics and finish by ( non)-equilibrium ensembles .",
    "all models belong to the @xmath4 class and can be described by finite or infinite ( named hierarchies in such cases ) system of @xmath4 equations :    * individual classical / quantum mechanics ( @xmath8 ) : linear / nonlinear ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 - quantized for the class of polynomial hamiltonians @xmath11 * qft - like models in framework of the second quantization ( dynamics in fock spaces ) . *",
    "classical ( non ) equilibrium ensembles via bbgky hierarchy ( with reductions to different forms of vlasov - maxwell / poisson equations ) .",
    "* wignerization of a ) : wigner - moyal - weyl - von neumann - lindblad . *",
    "wignerization of c ) : quantum ( non ) equilibrium ensembles .",
    "important remarks : points a)-e ) are considered in @xmath12 picture of ( non)linear @xmath12 dynamics ( surely , all @xmath13 ) ; dynamical variables / observables are the symbols of operators or functions ; in case of ensembles , the main set of dynamical variables consists of partitions ( n - particle partition functions ) .",
    "hierarchy of internal / hidden scales ( time , space , phase space ) .",
    "non - perturbative multiscales : from slow to fast contributions , from the coarser to the finer level of resolution / decomposition .",
    "coexistence of hierarchy of multiscale dynamics with transitions between scales .",
    "realization of the key features of the complex quantum world such as the existence of chaotic and/or entangled states with possible destruction in `` open / dissipative '' regimes due to interactions with quantum / classical environment and transition to decoherent states .    at this level",
    "we may interpret the effect of mysterious entanglement or `` quantum interaction '' as a result of simple interscale interaction or intermittency ( with allusion to hydrodynamics ) , i.e. the mixing of orbits generated by multiresolution representation of hidden underlying symmetry . surely , the concrete realization of such a symmetry is a natural physical property of the physical model as well as the space of representation and its proper functional realization .",
    "so , instantaneous interactions ( or transmission of `` quantum bits '' or `` teleportation '' ) materialize not in the physical space - time variety but in the space of representation of hidden symmetry along the orbits / scales constructed by proper representations",
    ". dynamical / kinematical principles of usual space - time varieties , definitely , do not cover kinematics of internal quantum space of state or , in more weak formulation , we still have not such explicit relations .",
    "one additional important comment : as usual in modern physics , we have the hierarchy of underlying symmetries ; so our internal symmetry of functional realization of space of states is really not more than kinematical , because much more rich algebraic structure , related to operator cuntz algebra and quantum groups , is hidden inside .",
    "the proper representations can generate much more interesting effects than ones described above .",
    "we will consider it elsewhere but mention here only how it can be realized by the existing functorial maps between proper categories :    \\{qmf } @xmath14 loop groups @xmath14 cuntz operator algebra @xmath14 quantum group structure , where \\{qmf } are the so - called quadratic mirror filters generating the realization of multiresolution decomposition / representation in any functional space ; loop group is well known in many areas of physics , e.g. soliton theory , strings etc , roughly speaking , its algebra coincides with virasoro algebra ; cuntz operator algebra is universal @xmath15 algebra generated by n elements with two relations between them ; quantum group structure ( bialgebra , hopf algebra , etc ) is well known in many areas because of its universality .",
    "it should be noted the appearance of natural fock structure inside this functorial sequence above with the creation operator realized as some generalization of cuntz - toeplitz isometries .",
    "surely , all that can open a new vision of old problems and bring new possibilities .",
    "we finish this part by the following qualitative definitions of key objects ( patterns ) .",
    "their description and understanding in different physical models is our main goal in this direction .    by localized states ( localized modes ) we mean the building blocks for solutions or generating modes which are localized in maximally small region of the phase ( as in c- as in q - case ) space .    by an entangled / chaotic pattern we mean some solution ( or asymptotics of solution ) which has random - like distributed energy ( or information ) spectrum in a full domain of definition .",
    "in quantum case we need to consider additional entangled - like patterns , roughly speaking , which can not be separated into pieces of sub - systems .    by a localized pattern ( waveleton ) we mean ( asymptotically ) ( meta ) stable solution localized in a relatively small region of the whole phase space ( or a domain of definition ) . in this case",
    "the energy is distributed during some time ( sufficiently large ) between only a few localized modes ( from point 1 ) .",
    "we believe it to be a good model for plasma in a fusion state ( energy confinement ) or a model for quantum continuous `` qubit '' or a result of the decoherence process in open quantum system when the full entangled state degenerates into localized ( quasiclassical ) pattern .",
