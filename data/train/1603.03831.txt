    "oxygen vacancies were introduced in commercial single crystals of srtio@xmath0 by heating them in the temperature range of 800 to 1100 degrees celsius in a vacuum in the range of 10@xmath63 mbar in a manner reported before@xcite .",

    "<S> the slight departure from unity above @xmath13 presumably results from imperfect squareness of the sample , the finite size of the contact size and other technical limitations . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",

    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there are three possible domains in an unconstrained crystal and the @xmath26 ratio is not the intrinsic anisotropy of srtio@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> its magnitude is set by the accidental imbalance between the population of these domains . </S>",
    "<S> one would expect therefore that the magnitude and the orientation of applied strain should modify the @xmath26 ratio ; as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , this is indeed the case . cooling the same sample in the presence of strain , </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy in the ordered state is enhanced . moreover , rotating the orientation of the applied strain by 90 degrees in the same sample yields an opposite sign for ( @xmath27 ) in the afd state . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the samples are multi - domain and applying compressive strain favors the two domains which have their ( longer ) @xmath6-axis perpendicular to the strain . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c , strained srti@xmath28nb@xmath29o@xmath0 displays also a sizeable anisotropy in its @xmath26 ratio below the transition temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the first outcome of this study is a quantification of the magnitude of @xmath26 ratio . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , in samples subject to compressive strain , this ratio can become as large as 1.2 . at first sight , it looks surprising that an anisotropy of this amplitude in charge conductivity results from a tetragonal distortion quantified by x - ray diffraction to be as small as 1.00056@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the tetragonal distortion is linked to the angle of rotation of the tio@xmath1 octahedra@xcite :    @xmath30    the measured values of @xmath31@xcite and @xmath32=1.00056 @xcite satisfy this expression . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c , the slight tetragonal distortion is accompanied by a more substantial misalignment between ti atoms . </S>",
    "<S> considering that their t@xmath33 orbitals host the threefold degenerate conduction bands of metallic srtio@xmath0 , the consequences can be drastic . </S>",
    "<S> a slight misalignment between adjacent tio@xmath1 octahedra can drastically change the overlap between t@xmath33 orbitals of two neighboring titanium atoms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a very small @xmath34 can cause a substantial drop in conductivity along the misalignment orientation providing a qualitative agreement for the experimental observation . as we will see below , according to first - principles band calculations , the fermi surface topology is deeply affected by the phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> a second and more unexpected result is the temperature dependence of the anisotropy in the ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in figures [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] , the temperature dependence of @xmath26 ratio is not monotonous . in srtio@xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , it peaks around 20 k and then decreases to below unity . in srti@xmath28nb@xmath29o@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence is even more complex , with a peak and a shallow minimum . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath26 ratio were proportional to an order parameter , then this would suggest a second phase transition well below 105 k. the existence of additional phase transitions in srtio@xmath0 has been a longstanding controversy . however , our observation can be accounted for if carrier scattering by phonons , electrons and defects do not share the same anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back to this below .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn our attention to the evolution of the afd transition temperature with doping . as seen in fig .  3 , the afd anomaly in @xmath26 ratio shifts to higher temperature with the substitution of ti with nb . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the evolution of @xmath13 with oxygen reduction and la substitution . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in agreement with previous studies of the afd transition using sound velocity@xcite and ramman scattering@xcite.the emerging picture is summarized in fig . 3e . </S>",
    "<S> while substituting ti with nb ( or sr with la ) leads to an upward shift of @xmath13 , introducing oxygen vacancies pulls it downward . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme sensitivity of the afd transition to the presence of a tiny concentration of foreign atoms is remarkable . substituting sr with larger la or ti with larger nb both </S>",
    "<S> strengthen the afd instability , presumably by weakening the stability of the cubic structure , which relies on a fragile balance of the three atomic radii in srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , this also happens when sr is replaced with smaller ca@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , oxygen vacancies weaken the tetragonal distortion , presumably because they destroy the antiferrodistortive coupling between adjacent octahedra .    </S>",
    "<S> the contrast in response of @xmath13 to oxygen reduction compared to la and nb substitution has an unnoticed implication . </S>",
    "<S> all three routes for @xmath35-doping , i.e. , oxygen removal , substituting ti(by nb)or sr ( by la)@xcite lead to a dilute metal with a superconducting @xmath14 which peaks at a carrier density in the range of @xmath36 @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> decades ago , appel@xcite suggested a link between the formation of cooper pairs and the soft phonon mode associated with the octahedra rotation and the afd transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the drastic difference in the dependency of @xmath13 on dopants type indicates that either the soft mode does not play a major role in superconductivity or its response to reduction and substitution is not the same as @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we carried out _ first - principles _ calculations to quantify the fermi surface ( fs ) anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.4 ] shows the fs cross sections at @xmath371 mev , the electron band structure , and the anisotropy of the fs as a function of @xmath32 for chemical potentials ( @xmath38 ) from 1 to 10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the lower conduction bands in sto originate from the same orbital manifold . in the tetragonal system </S>",
    "<S> they have distinct irreducible representations for the spatial degrees of freedom , which allows them to cross , only at a single point along 001 . in the plane ( or in any skew direction ) the afd rotation mixes their representations , and the bands will anticross , as is seen along 100 . in agreement with previous theoretical studies@xcite , we find that the cubic phase fs has six lobes and in the tetragonal state , two out of these six are squeezed .    </S>",
    "<S> according to shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) experiments @xcite when carrier density is @xmath397.8@xmath4010@xmath22@xmath23 , the fermi energy is close to @xmath41 mev . at this level ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) , we find a fs area in the ( 001 ) plane about 1.7 times larger than in the ( 010 ) plane , in fair agreement with the sdh data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated band masses are lighter than the experimental values , indicating the importance of renormalization by electron - phonon interactions and electron correlation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated renormalizations are 1.5 for the lower band ( similar to explicit calculations in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and 3.5 for the upper band . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative description of fermi surface would requires the calculation of _ anisotropic _ mass renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> the fs anisotropy , ( ratio of its radii along @xmath6 and @xmath42 ) reaches 0.65 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) for @xmath43 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi radius is shorter ( and @xmath44 larger ) along @xmath6 , such that the conductivity should be larger as well , in agreement with the experimental observation in the vicinity of @xmath13 . finally , according to the calculations </S>",
    "<S> , anisotropy decreases with increasing @xmath38(see the supplement ) . </S>",
    "<S> this matches the experimental observation of diminishing anomaly at @xmath13 with increasing doping ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.3]a - d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now examine the puzzle of the non - monotonic temperature dependence of @xmath45 . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , upon cooling from room temperature to liquid - helium temperature , the resistivity of metallic srtio@xmath0 drops by three orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> thus , inelastic scattering of electrons is by far the dominant scattering around 100 k. most of this inelastic scattering is due to phonons , but below 30 k , the electron - electron scattering leads to a quadratic temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows the low - temperature resistivity of a strained oxygen - reduced sample as a function of @xmath46 . in agreement with previous reports@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 and @xmath25 both follow a behavior described by @xmath47 ( i=@xmath48,@xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the prefactor is set by the expected anisotropy of conductivity stemming from the topology of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this temperature window , below the degeneracy temperature of electrons , the relevance of the fermi surface topology is straightforward . on the other hand , when the carrier density is as low as @xmath50 , the system is non - degenerate and subject to boltzmann statistics at 105 k. but , even in this non - degenerate regime , the anisotropy of conductivity still keeps the trace of the anisotropy of the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor of t - square resistivity along a - axis ( c - axis ) is @xmath51(@xmath52 ) [ the average ( @xmath53 ) is close to what was measured for a sample of comparable carrier density by a conventional four - probe technique@xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> as expected for an anisotropic fermi liquid , for example in upt@xmath0@xcite , the ratio ( @xmath54 ) is close to the ratio of the fermi velocities along @xmath6-axis and @xmath42-axis .    as seen in fig . 5 , the intercept ( i.e. the residual resistivity , @xmath55 ) is lower along the direction where the prefactor @xmath56 is larger . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> elastic scattering is larger along the orientation for which inelastic scattering is smaller . </S>",
    "<S> this generates a peak in @xmath26(@xmath57 ) , since the balance between the two components of the resistivity is changed at an intermediate temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this feature distinguishes srtio@xmath0 from other anisotropic fermi liquids . in the latter cases , the residual resistivity and the prefactor of the @xmath46 resistivity share the same anisotropy , set by the fermi velocity anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true of upt@xmath0@xciteas well as two other well - known perovskites , the ruthenate sr@xmath58ruo@xmath59@xcite and cuprate la@xmath60sr@xmath61cuo@xmath59@xcite . in both of these layered conductors , the prefactor of the quadratic term in the resistivity and the residual resistivity share the same anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the exceptional case of metallic srtio@xmath9 may be a result of the particular orientation of boundaries between twins in a sample subject to uniaxial strain ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5b ) . application of strain along one direction leads to the suppression of one domain out of three ( the one with its @xmath6-axis along the strain ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the fermi velocity is larger along the @xmath6-axis , the conductivity should become _ lower _ in the orientation parallel to the applied strain . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed what is seen experimentally . on the other hand , in such a configuration </S>",
    "<S> the favored domain boundary would lie along the orientation of compressive strain . as a scatterer </S>",
    "<S> , such a boundary would introduce additional scattering perpendicular to the direction of strain . </S>",
    "<S> this could explain the opposite signs of @xmath62 at the onset of the transition ( governed by the anisotropy of the fermi velocity ) and in the zero temperature limit ( set by the orientation of twin boundaries ) .    </S>",
    "<S> two other features should also be included in an exhaustive quantitative treatment of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the experimental evidence for enhanced conductivity along a twin boundary in srtio@xmath0@xcite , amplifying the anisotropy introduced by the presence of a twin boundary along the orientation of compressive strain . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the contrast between potential wells introduced by nb dopants and oxygen vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> they are expected to differ in structure and the angular distribution of the scattering they cause .    </S>",
    "<S> several other questions remain . </S>",
    "<S> the precise shape of the fermi surface in dilute metallic srtio@xmath0 is not settled yet . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed angle - dependent study on single - domain samples is necessary to map the full fs . </S>",
    "<S> the quantification of the non - parabolic dispersion is important to pin down the origin of the @xmath4 resistivity in the dilute limit@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - parabolicity leads to a distinction between momentum and velocity , and breaks galilean invariance@xcite , which is expected to play a significant role in the @xmath46 resistivity of srtio@xmath0 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we quantify the anisotropy of charge conductivity caused by the afd transition in metallic srtio@xmath0 , using the montgomery technique . </S>",
    "<S> both first - principles band calculations and experimental data find that the very slight departure from cubicity gives rise to a sizeable anisotropy in the fermi surface and conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with other anisotropic fermi liquids , elastic and inelastic resistivity do not present the same anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the contrasting response of the afd and superconducting phase transitions to the type of dopant argues against any role played by the octahedral rotational mode in superconductivity .    </S>",
