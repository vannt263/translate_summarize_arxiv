    "in 1996 september , a new x - ray transient was discovered with the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) on board the _ bepposax _ satellite and the source was designated sax j1808.43658 ( in t zand et al .",

    "the position of this brightest source , however , is located 1.63@xmath1 from the position of the optical counterpart of the millisecond x - ray pulsar , which is considerably larger than the 0.55@xmath1 error radius ( 68% confidence level ( 1@xmath21 ) ; conservatively calculated as the direct sum of the statistical ( 18@xmath10 ) and systematical ( 15@xmath10 ) 1@xmath21 errors ) on the source position .",

    "we detected four field sources during our observations .",
    "one source is 1.63@xmath1 away from the position of the millisecond x - ray pulsar , considerably larger than the 1@xmath21 error of 0.55@xmath1 .",

    "when assuming an @xmath13 of 1.22 @xmath31 @xmath15 and a power - law shaped spectrum with index 2 , this would result in an upper limit on the luminosity of @xmath32 erg s@xmath4  ( 0.510 kev ; for a distance of 2.5 kpc ) . in our _ asca _ observations we could not detect a source on the best position of the _ bepposax _ source with a range of upper limits on its x - ray flux of @xmath33 erg s@xmath4 @xmath15  ( 0.510.0 kev ; unabsorbed ) . if the column density is indeed @xmath34 cm@xmath4 then the upper limit determined with",

    "this discrepancy can mean that indeed the _ bepposax _ source is the millisecond pulsar or also this source is variable . in the latter case , the fact that this source is detected during all _ bepposax_/nfi observations ( including the 1999 march 17 ) and not during the only _ asca _ observation should then be regarded as a coincidence .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "fluxes obtained ( using w3pimms ) for the other three _ bepposax _ sources were consistent with the values obtained from the _ bepposax _ fluxes ( taking into account the uncertainties in the spectra , the internal absorption of the sources , and in calculating the fluxes using w3pimms ) .",
    "the nature of those field sources is unknown , but they could be , e.g. , agn .    if indeed the _ bepposax _ source is a previously unknown source , its proximity to the millisecond pulsar raises the question if all the outbursts so far observed from the pulsar are indeed due to this source and not from this extra source .",
    "it is clear that the source which exhibited the 1998 and 2000 outburst was the millisecond x - ray pulsar because during both outbursts the 401 hz pulsations were detected ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; van der klis et al .",
    "furthermore , during both outbursts the optical counterpart increased considerable in luminosity ( giles et al .",
    "1999 ; wachter & hoard 2000 ; wachter et al .",
    "2000 ; note , that this secures the sub - arcsecond accurate position of the pulsar )",
    ". however , the _ bepposax_/wfc positional errors of the persistent source detected during the 1996 outburst are consistent with both the position of the millisecond pulsar and the _ bepposax _ source . still , there are two measurements which provide convincing evidence that the 1996 outburst was also due to the millisecond x - ray pulsar .",
    "first , the 99% error regions of the three bursts detected during that outburst are all consistent with the pulsar , while that of one burst is clearly inconsistent with the other source .",
    "we note that all three bursts were observed in a small time window during the 1996 outburst and are most likely due to same source .",
    "second , there is a marginal detection of a 401 hz oscillation during one of the three bursts ( in t zand et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "independent whether the _ bepposax _ source can be identified with the millisecond x - ray pulsar or that it is an unrelated field source , it is clear that sax j1808.43658 has very low luminosities in quiescence . as discussed in detail by wijnands",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) , the very low luminosity of sax j1808.43658 during the _ bepposax _ observations demonstrate the highly variable nature of the source during its 2000 outburst .",
    "for example , the source luminosity was below a few times @xmath11 erg s@xmath4  on 2000 march 56 and 8 , it reached @xmath37 erg s@xmath4  on 2000 march 11 as observed with the _ rxte_/pca , but the source was very dim again with _",
    "bepposax_/nfi on 2000 march 2223 . also , on several occasions after 2000 march the source could again be detected with the _ rxte_/pca .",
    "therefore , although the x - ray luminosity was very low during our _ bepposax _ observations , the clear long - term activity of the source demonstrated that these observations can not be regarded as true quiescent observations .",
    "we reanalyzed the _",
    "observation of sax j1808.43658 reported by dotani et al .",
    "we confirm the detection of the millisecond x - ray pulsar . due to the uncertainties in its exact",
    "_ asca _ count rate ( see section  [ section : asca ] ) and its exact spectral shape , the exact quiescent luminosity of the millisecond pulsar is difficult to constrain but it is most likely in the range 0.31@xmath38 erg s@xmath4  ( 0.510 kev ) . despite this large uncertainty in its quiescent luminosity ,",
    "the source is clearly fainter than the other neutron - star lmxb x - ray transients when they are in quiescence ( which are larger than a few times @xmath39 erg s@xmath4 ) .",
    "if the quiescent luminosity of sax j1808.43658 is indeed as low as a few times @xmath40 erg s@xmath4 , then it is unclear whether the found distinction ( e.g. , garcia et al . 2001 and references therein ) between the quiescent luminosity of neutron - star transients and black - hole transients ( a few times @xmath41 erg s@xmath4 ) can hold . if certain neutron - star x - ray transients can indeed be as dim in quiescence as the black - hole systems , then the reasons to invoke the presence of event horizons in the black - hole systems will disappear ( garcia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "more observations of neutron - star transients in quiescence are required to assess the validity of reported quiescent luminosity difference between the two types of systems .",
    "such observations will also give important information to assess the question whether or not the millisecond x - ray pulsar is not only unique with respect to its pulsating nature , but also with respect to its quiescent behavior .",
    "brown , bildsten , & rutledge ( 1998 ) proposed that the quiescent x - ray luminosities of neutron - star lmxb transients depend on their time - averaged mass accretion rates . compared with the other systems , the time - averaged accretion rate of the millisecond x - ray pulsar is low and brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that this source should have a low quiescent x - ray luminosity . within the uncertainties of their model and our observations ,",
    "the predicted quiescent luminosity is consistent with the detected one .",
    "it is also possible that this low quiescent luminosity is related to the fact that the source is so far the only accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar known . for example , if this uniqueness is due to a higher neutron - star magnetic field than that of the other sources , then during quiescence the so - called propeller mechanism might inhibit residual accretion onto the neutron star . indications for residual accretion in quiescence have been found for the other neutron - star systems , which is mainly inferred from the power - law tail in their quiescent x - ray spectrum and the variability of several sources in quiescence ( however , see ushomirsky & rutledge 2001 for a discussion about x - ray variability due to deep crustal heating ) .",
    "however , only at most @xmath050% of the quiescent x - ray flux of those sources is due to this power - law component , suggesting that the low quiescent luminosity of sax j1808.43658 can only in part be due to the lack of residual accretion in this system .",
    "it is very well possible that the very low quiescent luminosity is due to a combination of the two above mentioned effects .",
    "the low time - averaged accretion rate of sax j1808.43658 will not heat - up its neutron star to the same temperature as in the other systems , causing a lower thermal luminosity from its surface .",
    "also , when residual accretion is inhibited due to its magnetic field , the power - law component is absent and the total quiescent x - ray luminosity of sax j1808.43658 could be very low compared to the other neutron - star x - ray transients in quiescence .",
    "high quality quiescent x - ray spectra ( e.g. , with _",
    "xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ ) of sax j1808.43658 will help considerably to understand its low quiescent luminosity .",
