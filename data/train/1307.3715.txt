    "multi - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) has been well recognized as an effective means to increase capacity in the downlink @xcite .",
    "however , challenges arise in practical cellular systems where inter - cell interference remains the bottleneck limiting the achievable performance . therefore , base station ( bs ) cooperation was recently proposed as a way to alleviate the issue , e.g. , @xcite , which is greatly motivated by the fact that bss may be connected via high - speed backhaul links and the channel state information ( csi ) and/or data and/or precoding matrices can be shared among the bss for coordinated transmission",
    ". such bs cooperation in the downlink can improve sum - rates and reduce outage as compared to the conventional or single - cell signal processing where the interference ( often from other cells ) is treated as noise .    despite the potential",
    ", the implementation of bs cooperation faces a fundamental challenge  the availability of csi at the transmitter side ( csit ) . in frequency - division - duplex ( fdd ) systems",
    ", although receivers could estimate the channel , quantize the csi , and feed it back to the transmitter via some finite - bandwidth feedback links , csit will be imperfect .",
    "this is less an issue for time - division - duplex ( tdd ) systems , but csi will still be imperfect due to estimation at finite training sequence length and finite signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . as the benefits of bs cooperation highly depend upon the quality of csit , recent efforts considered limited feedback models and imperfect csit in the design @xcite .",
    "the robust beamforming based on imperfect csit was studied in @xcite .    besides the issue of availability of csit , other issues such as synchronization and finite capacity backhaul need significant research efforts .",
    "nevertheless , several testbeds for implementing the bs cooperation have recently been developed @xcite to demonstrate the feasibility of the cooperative technique .",
    "for example , the berlin testbed demonstrated downlink bs coordination for an fdd lte trial system @xcite .",
    "zero - forcing ( zf ) precoding based on limited csi feedback was implemented jointly across two bss which exchanged csi as well as shared data over a low - latency signaling network .",
    "the bss were synchronized using the global positioning system ( gps ) .",
    "the success of these testbeds @xcite as well as several discussions raising in the lte - advanced study items @xcite has motivated us to provide further analytical results under the similar cooperative setting .",
    "emphasis is put on providing insight into the role of the key parameters on system performance .",
    "specifically , this paper considers a downlink system with multiple cooperative bss serving a number of single - antenna users , in which bss share the csi and data via high - speed backhaul links .",
    "also , the limited feedback and imperfect csit are taken into consideration .",
    "rather than employing the zf precoding , we consider that the bss perform regularized zf ( rzf ) @xcite for transmission .",
    "this is because when the channel is ill - conditioned , the achievable rates of zf are severely compromised but rzf introduces a regularization parameter in the channel inversion to mitigate the ill - condition problem . the regularization parameter can control the amount of the introduced interference but choosing it improperly degrades the performance considerably .",
    "ideally , one would choose the parameter to maximize the signal - to - interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) .    however , the system - wide sinr is a complex function of many system parameters such as channel vectors , channel - path gains , spatial correlations , imperfect csit , etc , which has motivated the researchers to use some approximate sinr expressions for optimizing the regularization parameter of rzf .",
    "one promising approach to achieve this is large - system analysis by means of large dimensional random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "remarkably , results derived from large - system analysis also provided reliable performance predictions even for small system dimensions and at a much lower computational cost than monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic - optimal regularization parameters in the large - system limit have been obtained for independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "channels in @xcite and for spatially correlated channels and imperfect csit in @xcite .",
    "further to the previous results , we provide a deterministic equivalent of the ergodic sum - rate for the _ coordinated _ bs system based on large dimensional rmt .",
    "our model takes into account many practical factors related to the multiple bss system .",
    "for example , channel - path gains , spatial correlations , and csit qualities from bss to each user can differ . as a special case",
    ", our contribution also complements the results of @xcite by extending the analysis to the case with multi - cell downlink coordinated systems , where links have different csit qualities even inside a channel vector from a user to all bss .",
    "such extension is nontrivial because several key manipulations for the multi - cell system with spatial correlations are required .",
    "most importantly , our deterministic equivalent result has brought out two fundamental applications :    * the deterministic equivalent sum - rate provides an efficient way to find the asymptotic - optimal regularization parameter , which by simulation results illustrates a good agreement with the optimum in terms of the ergodic sum - rates .",
    "the search of the optimal regularization parameter is a demanding process because monte - carlo averaging is required .",
    "therefore , we have overcome the fundamental difficulty of applying rzf precoding in the multi - cell downlink coordinated systems . * in conventional single - cell processing in fdd mode",
    ", each user compares its channel vector with a predefined codebook and subsequently feeds back the channel index to its serving bs @xcite . extending the technique to the case with bs cooperation would require that each user compares its cooperating user - bs channel pairs with a predefined codebook and then feeds back the channel indices to a single bs .",
    "the channel indices are then forwarded to other bss .",
    "imperfect csit is shared to all the bss ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] ) .",
    "intuitively , those user - bs pairs with weaker channel - path gains should not require the same number of quantization bits as those with stronger gains . in this paper",
    ", we address the fundamental csi feedback problem : given a total number of feedback bits of each user , how the feedback quantization bits be allocated among the different channel vectors .",
    "this is an important problem , but has received little attention .",
    "adaptive bit allocation of csi feedback in a multi - cell system was studied in @xcite but zf / rzf precoding was not used .",
    "the feedback bit allocation problem of rzf precoding under general channel scenarios has not been investigated before . by inspecting the properties of feedback bit allocation",
    ", we devise a subspace method to greatly reduce the number of bit combinations and hence the search complexity .",
