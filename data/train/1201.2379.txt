    "a population of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) might have been formed in the early universe due to gravitational collapse of sufficiently large - amplitude cosmological perturbations . following the initial papers suggesting this ( zeldovich & novikov ( 1969 ) @xcite ; hawking ( 1971 ) @xcite ; carr & hawking ( 1974 ) @xcite ; and carr ( 1975 ) @xcite )",
    ", various authors then investigated the process numerically ( nadezhin , novikov & polnarev ( 1978 ) @xcite ; bicknell & henriksen ( 1979 ) @xcite ; novikov & polnarev ( 1980 ) @xcite ; niemeyer and jedamzik ( 1999 ) @xcite ; shibata and sasaki ( 1999 ) @xcite ; hawke & stewart ( 2002 ) @xcite ; musco , miller & rezzolla ( 2005 ) @xcite ) . in order to form a pbh ,",
    "the perturbation would need to have an amplitude @xmath5 greater than a certain threshold value @xmath6 ( with @xmath5 often being defined as the relative mass excess inside the overdense region , measured at the time of horizon crossing ) .",
    "the numerical investigations clarified many different aspects of the nature of the process , with particular reference to the radiative era of the universe ( with the equation of state being taken as @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the pressure and @xmath1 is the energy density ) .",
    "this context represents the most commonly studied scenario for pbh formation .",
    "niemeyer & jedamzik ( 1999 ) @xcite showed that the masses of pbhs produced in the radiative era by perturbations of a given profile type , follow the typical scaling - law behaviour of critical collapse , first discovered for idealized circumstances by choptuik ( 1993 ) @xcite , i.e. the masses of the black holes produced follow a power law @xmath8 if @xmath5 is close enough to @xmath6 .",
    "neilsen & choptuik ( 2000 ) @xcite later showed that one could get a critical collapse , using a succession of `` imploding shells '' of matter as the initial conditions , for @xmath9 equations of state with any value of @xmath4 in the range @xmath10 .",
    "they found that the value of the critical exponent @xmath11 was dependent only on the value of @xmath4 and not on the particular form of the perturbation profile .    in 2002 ,",
    "hawke & stewart @xcite returned to the problem of pbh formation in the early universe , with @xmath12 , and investigated the nature of the collapse going down to smaller values of @xmath13 than niemeyer & jedamzik had been able to do with their code . for the larger values of @xmath14 ,",
    "comparable with those of @xcite , hawke & stewart again found a scaling law with a similar value of @xmath11 , but for smaller @xmath14 they saw formation of strong shocks and their curve of @xmath15 against @xmath16 flattened off at a minimum mass of around @xmath17 of their horizon mass .",
    "they also found that the value of @xmath6 depended strongly on the shape of the perturbation , in contrast to @xcite .    in musco",
    "et al ( 2005 ) @xcite , we considered pbh formation with initial conditions given by very small linear perturbations of the energy density and velocity fields approximating the growing components of cosmological perturbations , and imposed with a length - scale much larger than that of the cosmological horizon .",
    "the domination of the growing component becomes even greater by the time of horizon crossing , as any residual decaying component dies away .",
    "we again saw a scaling law with similar @xmath11 for the range of values of @xmath13 used in @xcite but found very different values of @xmath6 from @xcite for similar perturbation shapes ( we were concentrating on those types of perturbation ) .",
    "this difference was attributed to the fact that in @xcite , the perturbations were made just in the energy density and were imposed directly at the horizon scale , so that their value of @xmath6 was calculated with inclusion of a substantial decaying component which did not then contribute to the black hole formation .",
    "if one focuses on the effect of perturbations originating from inflation , then clearly only growing components will be relevant at much later times .    in polnarev & musco ( 2007 ) @xcite",
    ", this kind of cosmologically - relevant initial perturbation was imposed in a more precise way , using an asymptotic quasi - homogeneous solution @xcite .",
    "starting from a curvature perturbation , which is a time - independent quantity when the perturbation length - scale is much larger than the cosmological horizon @xcite , perturbations in all of the other quantities can then be specified in a consistent way , giving a solution with only a growing component .",
    "the metric perturbation can be large even when the perturbations in energy density and velocity are small , and only when there is a large - amplitude metric perturbation , corresponding to a non - linear initial perturbation of the curvature , can one get @xmath18 at horizon crossing .    in musco",
    "et al ( 2009 ) @xcite , we returned to the issue raised by hawke & stewart @xcite concerning whether the scaling law would continue down to very small values of @xmath13 . in order to address this",
    ", we needed to modify our code with the inclusion of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) so as to be able to handle the extreme conditions which arise near to the critical limit . in view of our earlier work",
    ", we were particularly wanting to investigate the effect of using initial perturbations with just a growing component imposed on a scale larger than the horizon , rather than the non - linear sub - horizon scale initial perturbations used in @xcite .",
    "we again used the quasi - homogeneous solution to provide our initial conditions . doing this",
    ", we did not observe the shock formation seen in @xcite ( which we attributed to the presence of a non - linear decaying component in their calculations ) but instead found that regular scaling - law behaviour was preserved all the way down to the vicinity of the resolution limit of our scheme ( going beyond the most extreme values shown in @xcite ) .",
    "a striking feature of our calculations was the appearance of an `` intermediate state '' for cases near to the critical limit .",
    "for these cases , when the over - dense region detaches from the rest of the universe , it reaches a compactness @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are its current radius and mass ) at which it then remains while proceeding to contract , shedding matter as it shrinks in such a way as to maintain @xmath22 roughly unchanging ( with just a small gradual decrease ) .",
    "this situation ( the `` intermediate state '' ) persists through many e - foldings if @xmath5 is very close to @xmath6 . eventually , it reaches a mass at which it either enters a final collapse phase leading to black hole formation , or disperses into the surrounding medium .",
    "the existence of a similarity solution for cases near to the critical limit , is a key feature in the theory of critical collapse @xcite , and in @xcite we saw some evidence of self - similarity also in the context of pbh formation within an expanding universe , associated with the intermediate state . in that paper , however , we were mainly focusing on the issue of preservation of the scaling - law . here , instead",
    ", we focus on the issue of self - similarity , aiming to clarify the extent to which our intermediate - state solution does follow a self - similar behaviour . as a secondary point , we also report on calculations which we have made for values of @xmath4 different from @xmath23 , using the same approach .",
    "although these other values are of less interest from a physical point of view , they have been considered previously in the critical - collapse literature , and it can be useful to study them using the same approach so as to get further insight into the main case of interest . also , this can be useful for indicating what may happen at epochs of the universe at which the equation of state softens due to phase transitions .    for the work of this paper , we have used the same numerical code as in @xcite , but with some fine tuning of the amr . following the present introduction ,",
    "section 2 reviews our mathematical formulation of the problem and presents the self - similar equations as they appear when written in the null - slicing foliation used for our numerical calculations .",
    "solutions of the self - similar equations are also presented there .",
    "section 3 contains a brief summary of the numerical methods used for the simulations . in section 4",
    ", we make comparison between the simulation results and the similarity solution , and section 5 discusses the changes in the values of @xmath11 and @xmath6 which come from varying @xmath4 and the shape of the initial perturbation .",
    "section 6 contains conclusions . throughout",
    ", we use units for which @xmath24 .",
    "for the calculations described here , we have followed the same basic methodology as described in our previous papers @xcite ( which we will refer to as papers 1 , 2 and 3 respectively ) .",
    "we therefore give just a brief summary of it here ; more details are contained in the previous papers .",
    "we use two different formulations of the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations : one for setting the initial conditions and the other for studying the black hole formation . throughout",
    ", we are assuming spherical symmetry and that the medium can be treated as a perfect fluid ; we use a lagrangian formulation of the equations with a radial coordinate @xmath25 which is co - moving with the matter .    for setting the initial conditions",
    ", it is convenient to use a diagonal form of the metric , with the time coordinate @xmath26 reducing to the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) time in the case of a homogeneous medium with no perturbations .",
    "( this sort of time coordinate is therefore often referred to as `` cosmic time '' ) .",
    "we write this metric in the form given by misner & sharp @xcite ( but with a change in notation for the metric coefficients ) :    ds^2=-a^2dt^2+b^2dr^2+r^2d^2+^2d^2 , [ sph_metric ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath20 being functions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and with @xmath20 playing the role of an eulerian radial coordinate .",
    "we follow the misner - sharp approach for writing the gr hydrodynamic equations . using the notation    d_t , [ d_t ]",
    "d_r , [ d_r ] one defines the quantities",
    "u d_t r , [ u ] and d_r r , [ gamma1 ] where @xmath29 is the radial component of four - velocity in the `` eulerian '' frame and @xmath30 is a generalized lorentz factor .",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath28 can then be written as    b . with these specifications ,",
    "the gr hydrodynamic equations can be written in the following form ( with the notation that @xmath1 is the energy density , @xmath0 is the pressure , @xmath31 is the compression factor and @xmath21 is the mass contained inside radius @xmath20 ) :    d_tu =- d_rp++4rp , [ euler1 ] d_t =- d_r(r^2u ) , [ d_trho ] d_t e = d_t , [ d_te ] d_t m=-4r^2 pu , [ d_tm ] d_r a =- d_r p , [ d_ra ] d_r m=4r^2 e , [ d_rm ] plus a constraint equation    ^2=1+u^2- .",
    "[ gamma ] an equation of state is also needed , and we are here considering ones of the form    p = w e , [ eq_state ] with @xmath4 being a constant .      a perturbation of the otherwise uniform medium representing the cosmological background solution , with the length - scale of the perturbation @xmath32 being much larger than the cosmological horizon @xmath33 .",
    "under these circumstances , the perturbations in @xmath1 and @xmath29 can be extremely small while still giving a large - amplitude perturbation of the metric ( as is necessary if a black hole is eventually to be formed ) and the above system of equations can then be solved analytically to first order in the small parameter @xmath34 . a full discussion of this has been given in paper 2 .",
    "the result obtained , referred to as the `` quasi - homogeneous solution '' , gives formulae for the perturbations of all of the metric and hydrodynamical quantities in terms only of a curvature perturbation profile @xmath35 , where @xmath25 is the co - moving radial coordinate linked to @xmath20 by @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the frw scale factor ; @xmath35 is conveniently time - independent when @xmath38 @xcite .    to characterize the amplitude of the perturbation , we use the integrated quantity ( t ) = ( r_0 ^ 3 ) ^-1 _ 0^r_0 4r^2 ( ) dr , [ delta_def ] which measures the relative mass excess within the overdense region , as frequently done in the literature ; @xmath39 is the background value of the energy density and @xmath40 is the co - moving length - scale of the overdense region of the perturbation . in paper 2 ( to which we refer for details ) it was shown that    e(r , t )",
    "= ( t ) , [ de ] and here we consider the initial curvature profile @xmath35 introduced in paper 2    k(r ) = 1 + - , [ curvature_profile ] which implies    k^(r ) = - 1 + - .",
    "inserting @xmath35 and @xmath41 into ( [ de ] ) one gets    e(r , t ) = ( t ) r_0 ^ 2 1 + 1 - + - .",
    "[ de2 ] the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath42 for a given @xmath35 , is obtained by putting to zero the expression inside the square brackets with @xmath25 set equal to @xmath40 .",
    "this gives    r_0 ^ 2 = f()^2 , [ r_0 ] where    f ( ) [ f_alpha ] fixing the parameter @xmath43 selects a particular perturbation profile , with the simplest choice being given by @xmath44 , corresponding to a gaussian curvature profile @xmath35    k(r ) = - ^2 , [ k(r ) ] which gives a mexican hat profile for the energy density perturbation @xmath45 , as often used in in the literature @xcite :    e(r , t ) ( t ) ^2 1 - .",
    "[ mex_hat ] the perturbation shape is fixed by the choice of @xmath43 , while the perturbation amplitude is determined by the value chosen for @xmath42 . inserting ( [ de2 ] ) into ( [ delta_def ] ) one gets    \\(t ) = ( t ) f()^2 1 + , [ delta ] within the linear regime , where @xmath38 , with the time evolution of the perturbation being given by @xmath46 , which measures how the perturbation length - scale @xmath32 changes with respect to the cosmological horizon scale @xmath47 .",
    "the expression for @xmath48 involves only background quantities for the unperturbed universe and inserting this gives ( t ) = ( t_i ) ^ , which leads to the familiar relationships @xmath49 when @xmath3 and @xmath50 when @xmath51 .    for our discussion here",
    ", we need a value for @xmath5 measured in a standard way , and it is convenient to use for this the value given by taking @xmath52 in ( [ delta ] ) . for small perturbations , this value for @xmath5 coincides with the one at the horizon - crossing time , and it does not differ by very much from that even for the larger perturbations of interest for pbh formation , at least for the types of perturbation profile being used here . since evaluating ( [ delta ] ) analytically in this way is much more precise than making a numerical integral on the grid at horizon - crossing time , we use this value here , as we did in papers 2 and 3 .      in our work , the misner - sharp approach , with cosmic time slicing , has been used for setting the initial conditions and then for evolving them to produce corresponding initial conditions on an outgoing null slice .",
    "these are then passed to the main code which uses the `` observer time '' null - slicing formulation of hernandez & misner @xcite for following the further evolution leading up to black hole formation . in this formulation",
    ", each outgoing null slice is labelled with a time coordinate @xmath53 , which takes a constant value everywhere on the slice , and the metric ( [ sph_metric ] ) is re - written as ds^2=-f^2du^2 - 2fbdrdu+r^2(d^2+^2 d^2 ) , [ nullmetric ] where @xmath54 is the new lapse function which determines how the value of @xmath53 changes from one slice to another .",
    "the lapse @xmath54 needs to be normalised by setting @xmath53 equal to the proper time of some suitable observer , and the standard way of doing this is to equate it to the proper time of a distant observer , as we have done in our previous papers ( setting @xmath55 at the location of that observer ) .",
    "however , this is not suitable for our present discussion of the connection with similarity solutions , because distant observers are not within the region covered by the similarity solution .",
    "because of this , we instead synchronise here with the proper time of a central observer , setting @xmath55 at @xmath56 .    within this formulation ,",
    "the operators equivalent to ( [ d_t ] ) and ( [ d_r ] ) are d_t ( ) , [ d_u ] d_k ( ) , [ d_k ] where @xmath57 is the radial derivative in the null slice and the corresponding derivative in the misner - sharp space - like slice is given by d_r = d_k - d_t .",

    "the quantity @xmath30 is given by ( [ gamma ] ) , as before , and we also have = d_kr - u , which replaces equation ( [ gamma1 ] ) in this slicing .      in this paper , we are wanting to investigate the connection between our numerical calculations for gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations within the expanding medium of the early universe , and studies by previous authors looking at the problem of critical collapse under simpler circumstances ( in particular , with asymptotic flatness ) where the presence of similarity solutions plays a key role . there",
    ", as @xmath59 , one approaches a critical solution where all of the matter in the original contracting region is shed during the contraction which ends , with zero matter , at a time referred to as the critical time @xmath60 .",
    "the later stages of this follow a similarity solution . for small positive values of @xmath61 , the similarity solution",
    "is closely approached but eventually there is a divergence away from it , with the remaining material collapsing to form a black hole . in our previous calculations ,",
    "we have noted the appearance of an `` intermediate state '' during which the behaviour gave some indication of being roughly self - similar .",
    "here , we are wanting to investigate this in more detail in order to understand how closely this reproduces what was seen in the previous critical collapse work . for doing this , we first needed to derive the equations governing the similarity solutions in the hernandez - misner foliation , as used for our numerical calculations .",
    "our self - similar coordinate @xmath62 is the ratio between the distance away from the centre of symmetry and the time away from the critical time , both of which are given in terms of invariantly - defined quantities .",
    "for the distance , we use the circumferential radius @xmath20 and for the time we use the outgoing null time @xmath53 with the lapse @xmath54 set equal to @xmath63 at the centre , so that @xmath53 is synchronized with the proper time of a central observer .",
    "( note that this approach is importantly different from that of evans & coleman @xcite who normalised the time differently and obtained a more complicated form for their similarity solution . ) for deriving the hydrodynamical equations in self - similar form , it is convenient to set the zero point of the time scale to be at the critical time .",
    "the times being considered are ones before the critical time and hence take negative values ; we then define our self - similar coordinate , which needs to be positive , as - , [ xi_ot ] and look for a solution of the system of partial differential equations of the previous section in terms of quantities depending only on @xmath62 . for that set of quantities",
    "we have @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath54 , as already defined , and two new ones : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while we eliminate @xmath31 by combining equations ( [ d_trho2 ] ) and ( [ d_te2 ] ) , and write the pressure @xmath0 in terms of the energy density @xmath1 using the equation of state @xmath66 ( which gives the sound - speed @xmath67 ) . to derive the self - similar form of the equations , we then proceed as follows .",
    "first , we write the hernandez - misner equations in an `` eulerian '' form , using coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath53 . for a general quantity @xmath68 , we have dy = ( ) _ rdu + ( ) _ udr , which then gives ( ) _ r & = & ( ) _ r + ( ) _ u ( ) _ r , + & & ( ) _ r + fu()_u , inserting the expression for @xmath69 . similarly ( )",
    "u & = & ( ) _ u ( ) _ u , + & & b(+ u)()_u inserting the expression for @xmath70 . the operators @xmath71 and @xmath57 can therefore be written in the eulerian form d_t ( ) _ r = ( ) _ r + u()_u , + d_k ( ) _ u = ( + u)()_u , which , combined with the definition of the self - similar coordinate @xmath62 , gives d_t = ( u + ) , + d_k = ( + u ) , one then finds that equations ( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ euler2 ] ) - ( [ d_km ] ) can indeed be recast as a system for @xmath29 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath54 and @xmath30 , depending only on @xmath62 .",
    "after a considerable amount of algebra , we arrive at a set of three ordinary differential equations = ( - ) - [ self_u_ot ] + & + = + ( - ) - [ self_omega_ot ] + & + = ( - ) - [ self_phi_ot ] together with two algebraic equations = 1 + u^2 -2 , + f = - ( - ) - ( + w ) .",
    "note that the three odes do not depend explicitly on the lapse @xmath54 .",
    "however , @xmath29 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 all require a boundary condition .",
    "clearly they all go to zero at @xmath74 , and hence at @xmath75 , but since the equations involve derivatives with respect to @xmath76 , we need to series - expand away from @xmath75 in order to start our integration . to get the expression for @xmath29 , it is necessary to specify the central value of @xmath54 which , as already mentioned , we are setting equal to @xmath63 . for small @xmath62 , we then find to lowest order in @xmath62 , with the constant @xmath77 being determined by requiring regularity of the solution for @xmath29 at the critical point , where the numerator and denominator of the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ self_u_ot ] ) both go to zero .     the self - similar solutions in null time for @xmath29 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 plotted against @xmath78 for @xmath12.,width=264 ]    the integration of equations ( [ self_u_ot ] ) - ( [ self_phi_ot ] ) was carried out using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme , with a shooting method being used to determine the value of @xmath77 . since @xmath29 can be negative , the derivative @xmath79 needs to be re - written as @xmath80 when performing the integration .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig.1 ] where @xmath29 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are plotted as functions of @xmath78 for @xmath12 .",
    "the present calculations for pbh formation have been made with the same code as used in paper 3 . since",
    "this has been fully described previously , we will just give a brief outline of it here .",
    "it is an explicit lagrangian hydrodynamics code based on that of miller & motta ( 1989 ) @xcite but with the grid organized in a way similar to that of miller & rezzolla ( 1995 ) @xcite which was designed for calculations in an expanding cosmological background .",
    "the code has a long history and has been carefully tested in its various forms .",
    "the basic grid uses logarithmic spacing in a mass - type comoving coordinate , allowing it to reach out to very large radii while giving finer resolution at small radii .",
    "our initial data is derived from the quasi - homogeneous solution and is specified on a space - like slice ( at constant cosmic time ) with @xmath81 , giving @xmath82 .",
    "the outer edge of the grid has here been placed at @xmath83 for convenience in making some of the plots ; putting it at @xmath84 , as we did previously , was already sufficient for ensuring that there is no causal contact between it and the perturbed region during the time of the calculations . the initial data is then evolved using the misner - sharp equations ( [ euler1]-[gamma ] ) , so as to generate a second set of initial data on a null slice and the null - slice initial data is then evolved using the hernandez - misner equations ( see @xcite ) .    for the calculations presented in paper 3 , we introduced an adaptive mesh refinement scheme ( amr ) , on top of the existing logarithmic grid , giving us sufficient resolution so as to be able to follow black hole formation down to extremely small values of @xmath13 . having the amr is particularly important for allowing us to follow the deep voids which form outside the central contracting region in cases very close to the critical limit .",
    "the same scheme has been used with just minor modifications for the calculations presented here .",
    "our aim in writing the amr was to avoid the use of artificial viscosity , but it has now emerged that some residual artificial viscosity was still present and is necessary for correct functioning of the code in its present form .",
    "the presence of this is not thought to affect the results presented in any important way , however .",
    "we have successfully used the scheme with more than thirty levels of refinement and all relevant features of the solutions have been fully resolved .",
    "in this section , we present results from our investigation of the extent to which the `` intermediate state '' seen previously in our numerical simulations corresponds to the similarity solution discussed in section [ similarity ] .",
    "first , we recall the background to this coming from our earlier work .    at the beginning of our calculations",
    ", we have a growing perturbation , with a length - scale larger than the cosmological horizon , consisting of a slight over - density which is expanding along with the rest of the universe but a little more slowly .",
    "after it enters within the cosmological horizon , it starts to contract and then collapse if its amplitude @xmath5 is large enough .",
    "as described earlier , if @xmath5 is greater than the critical value @xmath6 , it goes on to produce a black hole , while for smaller values it eventually disperses into the background medium .",
    "initially , the over - dense region has decreasing compactness @xmath22 but , if @xmath5 is only slightly greater than @xmath6 , it then reaches a value of @xmath22 at which it remains with very little change as it proceeds to contract , shedding matter as it shrinks in such a way as to keep @xmath22 roughly constant ( but with just a small continuing gradual decrease ) . for a radiation fluid with @xmath12 ,",
    "this `` intermediate state '' has @xmath85 , quite far from the condition for a black hole .",
    "a large pressure gradient develops at the edge of the contracting matter and it is this which drives the wind , opening up a deep void between the contracting matter and the rest of the universe .",
    "eventually , there is a deviation away from the intermediate state and @xmath22 increases towards @xmath63 .",

    "regarding @xmath6 , although the change with @xmath43 does not seem to be very large , it could be cosmologically relevant because the pbh mass spectrum is very sensitive to the precise value of @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore important to establish the connection between different inflationary models and the probabilities for different initial perturbation shapes , and more investigation of this should be made in future for getting a better understanding of the possible cosmological impact of pbhs .",
    "the plot indicates that among the profiles studied here , the simple mexican hat ( with @xmath148 ) gives the lowest value of @xmath6 and so the highest probability of forming pbhs .",
    "the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath4 confirms that any epochs in the early universe when the equation of state softens should be favourable for enhancing pbh production .",
    "one example of this could be the qcd phase transition , which has previously been discussed in connection with a pbh model for machos @xcite .    finally we want to comment here on one of our earlier results , in paper 1 , where we investigated critical collapse for a radiative fluid also in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath149 . at the time of paper 1 , our code was not able to get very close to the critical limit because of not yet having the amr , and the lowest value of @xmath96 that we were able to treat was around @xmath17 .",
    "in that regime we found that the presence of a cosmological constant was affecting the scaling law , giving a change in the value of @xmath11 in the sense of decreasing it with increasing ( positive ) @xmath149 .",
    "now , with the present amr code , we have made similar calculations going down to much smaller values of @xmath96 and have seen that this change in @xmath11 disappears as one gets closer to @xmath6 ( i.e. the gradients of the two scaling laws converge to the same value ) .",
    "the reason for this is clear : if @xmath5 is very close to @xmath6 , the mass of the black hole is small and the fluid densities involved in forming it are high . under these circumstances , the energy density related to",
    "the cosmological constant becomes negligible in comparison with that of the collapsing fluid .",
    "this makes the gradient of the scaling law converge to the same value as without the cosmological constant when @xmath96 is sufficiently small .",
    "however , the cosmological constant still makes a relevant ( and growing ) contribution on larger scales where the fluid density is lower .",
    "following on after our previous work investigating primordial black hole formation during the radiative era of the early universe , we have here investigated further the critical nature of the collapse in this context , focusing on the intermediate state , which appears in the case of perturbations close to the critical limit .",
    "we have examined the extent to which this follows a similarity solution , deriving and solving the set of equations describing a self - similar solution within the same foliation used for our simulations of black hole formation .",
    "this is a key issue , because the presence of a similarity solution is seen as an important characteristic feature of the general phenomenon of critical collapse .",
    "also , we have presented results from calculations where the equation of state parameter @xmath4 was allowed to take constant values different from the radiation value of @xmath23 , with the aim of gaining further insight into our main case of interest , and have studied the effect of using different perturbation shapes .",
    "our calculations have been made using a purpose - built lagrangian amr code , starting with initial supra - horizon scale perturbations of a type which could have come from inflation and then following self - consistently both the formation of the black hole and the continuing expansion of the universe .    from our simulation results",
    ", we have found that the similarity solution does indeed emerge in this context as an attractor solution approached during the intermediate state .",
    "however , for runs with perturbations whose amplitude @xmath5 is just above the critical value @xmath6 , we observe it arising together with decaying and growing perturbation modes . first , the decaying mode is seen operating as the similarity solution is approached during the intermediate state but then the growing mode takes over , leading away from the intermediate state and the similarity solution , towards black hole formation .",
    "as expected , the index of the growing mode is found to be closely equal to @xmath116 , where @xmath11 is the exponent of the scaling law for the black - hole mass . during the time of the intermediate state ,",
    "the range over which the similarity solution gives a good approximation to the simulation results becomes progressively larger , eventually extending over all of the contracting region and part of the surrounding evacuated region , up to the maximum in the velocity of the relativistic wind , corresponding to the deepest point of the surrounding semi - void .",
    "further out , the simulation results diverge completely away from the similarity solution , transitioning onto the surrounding expanding universe . from our simulations for cosmological - type perturbations using values for @xmath4 different from @xmath23 , we have found that in every case , scaling - law behaviour persists down to the smallest values of @xmath13 for which we were able to make satisfactory calculations , with the values obtained for the exponent @xmath11 being in almost perfect agreement with those obtained previously by other authors .",
    "the critical threshold amplitude @xmath6 , the intermediate state compactness @xmath110 and the scaling - law exponent @xmath11 all vary with @xmath4 in a way which is easily understandable in view of @xmath4 being the ratio between the pressure and energy density of the fluid .",
