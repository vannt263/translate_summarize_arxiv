    "in recent years , the discovery and further characterization of transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) has provided unique information about the nature of planetary systems . the analysis of a planet which periodically eclipses its host star yields the physical radius , the inclination and the mass of the system in addition to the parameters which are gathered from the radial velocity measurements .",
    "since the discovery of the first such system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more than 40 other teps were discovered around other stars . currently operating ground - based surveys are producing numerous new discoveries .",
    "the doubling period of the number of known teps is below one year .",
    "moreover , existing ( corot , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and planned space - borne instruments ( e.g. kepler mission , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are expected to yield hundreds of new discoveries of such systems , even with planetary radii comparable to that of earth .",
    "also , subsequent observations of a given transiting system can provide some information on the variations in the timing of successive transits and the light curve shape .",
    "these detections can be used to constrain other planetary companions @xcite or co - orbital companions ( trojans , see * ? ? ?",
    "in order to optimize the precision and speed of tep observations , a careful analysis of the light curves is required .",
    "the basis of such light curve analysis is to find an adequate model of planetary obscuration , which causes a small decrease in the stellar flux .",
    "since both the stellar and the planetary body can be well modelled by a spheroidal shape , the decrease in the stellar flux can be estimated from the full or partial overlap of two circles .",
    "the star itself has a non - negligible limb darkening which depends on both the stellar properties and the photometric band and quantified by a small set of coefficients ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for such tables of limb darkening constants ) .",
    "at present , the most widely used models for this problem have been given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculate closed form expressions for the flux decrease assuming non - linear or quadratic limb darkening ( quantified by 4 or 2 coefficients , respectively ) while @xcite gives an infinite series where the limb darkening can be taken into account up to arbitrary order . in most cases the quadratic case is adequate because the photometric precision of typical data is not good enough for the higher order limb darkening models to make a difference .",
    "most data modeling algorithms , including the well known nonlinear levenberg - marquardt fitting method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) utilize the partial derivatives of the model function with respect to the model parameters .",
    "the uncertainties in the model parameters can be well characterized by the fisher information matrix ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also requiring knowledge of the same partial derivatives .",
    "therefore , in the case of planetary transits , the parametric derivatives of the flux decrease function can be extremely valuable .",
    "moreover , partial derivatives can be used to construct a set of uncorrelated parameters of the light curve which is preferred by most of the parameter fitting algorithms ( e.g. levenberg - marquardt , downhill simplex , markov chain monte carlo ) .",
    "also , the analysis of the partial derivatives with respect to the limb darkening coefficients themselves yields a combination of these with which consistent sanity checks can be done verifying the stellar atmospheric properties in an independent way .",
    "finally , these derivatives can be used to directly calculate how the variations in the orbital parameters affect transit timing and the shape of the light curve .    in this paper , we present the partial derivatives of the flux decrease function assuming a quadratic limb darkening law . in the next section ,",
    "the formalism and the derivatives are presented . in section 3 , we apply these derivatives to construct a set of well behaved parameterizations of transiting light curves which yield an always finite and moderate correlation between the adjusted quantities in all important cases and limits .",
    "the correlations between the limb darkening coefficients are also discussed .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section .",
    ".exclusion cases of different occultation geometries . to figure out the respective case for a certain value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , check the relations step by step :",
    "if the current relation is true , that case can be assigned to the given values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , otherwise go to the next step .",
    "the final case @xmath3 is when there is no obscuration .",
    "cases with subscripts can only occur if the radius of the planet is not smaller than @xmath4 . [",
