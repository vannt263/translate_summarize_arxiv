    "\\(175706 ) 1996 fg3 ( hereafter , 1996 fg3 ) is a binary near - earth asteroid ( nea ) belonging to the apollo type , which has a very low @xmath12v value @xmath2 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this asteroid was originally chosen as the target for a proposed sample return mission @xcite , called marcopolo - r .",
    "eclipse events have been observed in the binary system 1996 fg3 in optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the period of mutual orbit is @xmath14 , and the diameter ratio @xmath15 is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the primary is assumed to be an oblate ellipsoid with a major axis ratio @xmath17 , while the secondary is prolate with a major axis ratio about 1.4 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed the rotation period of the primary is @xmath18 , and the mass density @xmath19 g @xmath20 , where 1996 fg3 is generally classified as a complex c - type @xcite .",
    "the optical magnitude and phase coefficient are derived as @xmath21 and @xmath22 by @xcite , while @xcite used additional data to derive @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite obtained an area - equivalent diameter of @xmath25 and a geometric albedo of @xmath26 for 1996 fg3 , based on thermal observations ( 3.6 and @xmath27 ) from the `` warm spitzer '' space telescope .",
    "furthermore , @xcite measured the effective diameter and geometric albedo of the asteroid to be @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 for a solar phase angle @xmath31 from an neatm @xcite procedure .",
    "in addition , using neatm method , @xcite also obtained 1996 fg3 s effective diameter and geometric albedo of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , beaming parameter @xmath34 , for a phase angle @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite modeled the formation of the binaries to be a history of rotation acceleration due to the yorp mechanism .",
    "generally , the asymmetric reflection of sunlight and asymmetric thermal emission from an asteroid s surface produces a net force and a net torque .",
    "the net force causes the orbit of the asteroid to drift , i.e. , yarkovsky effect , and the net torque alters its rotation period and direction of its rotation axis , i.e. , yorp effect @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric shape of an asteroid , as well as the existence of its finite rotation period and thermal inertia , plays a major role in affecting yarkovsky and yorp effects .",
    "thermal inertia is an important parameter that controls temperature distribution over the surface and sub - surface of the asteroid , and it is defined by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mass density , @xmath38 the thermal conductivity , and @xmath39 the specific heat capacity . according to the definition , thermal inertia depends mainly on the regolith particle size and depth , degree of compaction , and exposure of solid rocks and boulders within the top few centimeters of sub - surface @xcite . therefore , thermal inertia may act as a vital indicator to infer the presence or absence of loose material on the asteroid s surface .",
    "the thermal inertia of an asteroid may be evaluated by fitting mid - infrared observations by applying a thermal model to reproduce mid - ir emission curves .",
    "@xcite proposed a so - called thermophysical model ( tpm ) , which is adopted to calculate infrared emission fluxes as a function of the asteroid s albedo , thermal inertia , correction factor and so on .",
    "for example , we provide several values of @xmath7 for the targets of complete / future asteroid missions . on the basis of tpm , @xcite measured the thermal inertia of asteroid ( 25143 ) itokawa to be @xmath2 @xmath40 .",
    "again , @xcite showed that the @xmath7 of 1999 ju3 is likely to be in the range of @xmath41 . the average thermal inertia of 1999 rq36 is estimated to be @xmath2 @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed an advanced thermophysical model ( atpm ) to extensively investigate the thermal nature of the asteroid .",
    "subsequently , @xcite obtained a best - fit thermal inertia @xmath43 for 1996 fg3 with atpm .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "firstly , section 2 gives a brief introduction to the thermophysical model developed by @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we concentrate our study on deriving a new 3d shape model for the primary of 1996 fg3 from the known optical lightcurves @xcite . the rotation period and",
    "spin axis of the primary are again updated in this work but they appear to be slightly different from those of @xcite . subsequently , in section 4 , we independently develop computation codes that duplicates atpm @xcite , and then carry out extensive fittings using three sets of mid - infrared observations of 1996 fg3 @xcite to investigate the primary s surface physical properties , such as the average thermal inertia , geometric albedo and roughness .",
    "the results show that this asteroid may have a very rough surface , in the meanwhile the thermal inertia and geometric albedo seem to be relatively low , indicative of the existence of loose material or regolith spreading over the asteroid s surface . moreover , section 5 deals with the global surface and sub - surface temperature distribution at the aphelion and perihelion , and the minimum depth of regolith layer over the very surface of the primary from the simulations . in final , section 6",
    "presents the primary results of this work and gives a concise discussion .",
    "an asteroid is assumed to be a polyhedron composed of n triangle facets in atpm . for each facet",
    ", the conservation of energy leads to the surface boundary condition @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bond albedo , @xmath46 indicates whether facet @xmath47 is illuminated by the sun , @xmath48 is the thermal emissivity , @xmath49 the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath38 the thermal conductivity , and @xmath50 the depth below the surface , respectively .",
    "@xmath51 means a function that returns the cosine of the sunlight incident angle .",
    "@xmath52 is the integrated solar flux at the distance of the asteroid , which can be approximated by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the solar constant , about @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the heliocentric distance in au . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the total multiple - scattered and thermal - radiated fluxes incident onto the facet from other facets , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 is the albedo of the surface at thermal - infrared wavelengths .",
    "temperature @xmath60 can be written as a function of time @xmath61 and depth @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "it can be described by one - dimension ( 1d ) heat diffusion equation @xmath63    for the asteroid , which may have a regolith layer over its surface , the temperature below the surface regolith is supposed to be constant .",
    "thus an internal boundary condition could be given by @xmath64 theoretically , the temperature distribution can be directly obtained by solving equation ( [ heat ] ) and the boundary conditions of equations ( [ surbc ] ) and ( [ inbc ] ) . however , the surface boundary condition is a nonlinear equation , thus we will attempt to solve them with numerical methods .    in order to simplify the solution of this problem , it is useful to introduce a standard transformation @xcite as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is referred to as skin depth . and    @xmath67",
    "is called effective temperature .",
    "thus , the 1d heat diffusion equation is rewritten as @xmath68 while the surface boundary condition and internal boundary condition are converted into @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath7 is the thermal inertia , and @xmath73 is the thermal parameter .    by numerically solving equation ( [ tf ] ) with boundary condition equations ( [ sbc ] ) and ( [ ibc ] ) , we can acquire the global temperature distribution over the surface and sub - surface of the asteroid . according to the theory ,",
    "the program codes are also developed for investigation . in the following",
    ", we will introduce the results based on numerical calculations .          on the basis of surface temperature distribution calculated from atpm",
    ", we may estimate thermal infrared fluxes from the asteroid for a given phase angle @xmath74 and geocentric distance @xmath12 .",
    "first of all , a body - fixed coordinate system is established ( see figure 1 ) , where the origin @xmath75 locates at the center of asteroid , z - axis is parallel to its spin axis , and x - axis is chosen to remain in a plane determined by z - axis and the line of sun - asteroid , directing towards the sun .",
    "the direction vector of earth in the body - fixed system is calculated from the asteroid s orbit , expressed as @xmath76 .",
    "normal vector of each facet @xmath77 is determined from the shape model of the asteroid .",
    "hence , the view factor of each facet relative to earth can be evaluated by @xmath78 where @xmath79 indicates that facet @xmath47 can be seen from earth , otherwise @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the area of facet @xmath47 .    the flux emitted by each facet",
    "is described by the plank function @xmath82 consequently , the total fluxes observed from earth are fully integrated over each facet @xmath83",
    "according to direct images from space missions and radar measurements , the asteroids in small - size have an irregular shape , while those larger objects appear to be relatively regular shape .",
    "for instance , vesta seems to be more circular than eros . considering the asteroid s rotation ,",
    "the observed lightcurves change with a lot of extrema , which provide key information on modeling its shape and morphology .",
    "hence , the substantial shape and spin status of the asteroid can be derived from the observations . @xcite and @xcite developed the lightcurve inverse scheme , and in their model , the inverse problem",
    "is perfectly solved using modern deconvolution method and optimization techniques . with the assistance of the optical data ,",
    "a convex shape of asteroid will be obtained . after repeating the fitting of the convex shape and additional observations , an improved shape of the asteroid",
    "will be better constructed .",
    "the relative chi - square is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the modeled and observed brightness from lightcurves , respectively . @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the averaged brightness of the observed data and the model , respectively . at the end of iteration , chi - square will approach a tiny value .",
    "usually , for an asteroid , there are a great many of observations with respect to various solar angles at different epochs .",
    "therefore , such method will yield a reliable result for the shape model .",
    ".14 lightcurves adopted in the shape model of 1996 fg3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the following section , we will then utilize the above derived parameters to evaluate the surface thermal environment of 1996 fg3 at its aphelion and perihelion respectively .",
    "on the basis of the derived shape model from the observations , the physical parameters in table [ phpa ] , and the thermal inertia determined from the atpm fitting process , we attempt to simulate the temperature variation of 1996 fg3 over a rotation period . in figures [ aph - per ] and [ gtemp ] , we show the equatorial temperature and global surface temperature distribution for the primary at aphelion and perihelion , respectively .",
    "figure [ aph - per ] shows the equatorial temperature distribution of 1996 fg3 at its aphelion and perihelion respectively .",
    "the maximum temperature does not appear at the solar point , but delays about @xmath89 , and the minimum temperature occurs just a little after the local sunrise , delaying about @xmath90 .",
    "such delay effect between absorption and emission is actually caused by the non - zero thermal inertia and the finite rotation speed of the asteroid .",
    "on the other hand , according to figure [ aph - per ] , the equatorial temperature of 1996 fg3 may range from @xmath91 to @xmath92 over a whole orbit period .",
    "figure [ gtemp ] shows the global surface temperature distribution of 1996 fg3 at its aphelion ( left ) and perihelion ( right ) respectively . in this figure",
    ", z - axis represents the asteroid s spin axis , and x - axis points to the sun in the framework of an asteroid center body - fixed coordinate system .",
    "the profile of temperature in figure [ gtemp ] is shown by the index of color - bar , and the red region represents the facets are sunlit , while the blue facets are referred to relatively low temperature .          as mentioned previously ,",
    "1996 fg3 is chosen to be a backup target for marcopolo - r sample return mission .",
    "hence , we still show great interest in the surface feature of the asteroid whether there exists a regolith layer on its surface .",
    "apparently , thermal inertia is associated with the surface properties , where it will be helpful to infer the presence or absence of loose material on the surface . as known to all , fine dust has a very low thermal inertia about @xmath93 , lunar regolith owns a relatively low value about @xmath94 , a sandy regolith like eros soil bears a value of @xmath95 , but coarse sand occupies a higher thermal inertia profile @xmath2 @xmath96 ( e.g. , itokawa s muses - sea regio ) . in comparison with the above materials",
    ", bare rock has an extremely higher thermal inertia more than @xmath97 @xcite . in this work",
    ", the thermal inertia of 1996 fg3 is estimated to be @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , it is quite natural for one to suppose that the surface of 1996 fg3 may be covered by loose materials , perhaps a mixture of dust , fragmentary rocky debris and sand . in other word , there may exist a regolith layer on the surface of 1996 fg3 , according to the above derived thermal inertia .",
    "theoretically , the so - called `` skin depth '' : @xmath66 is usually used to characterize the grain size of regolith . according to the definition of thermal inertia @xmath98 .",
    "the profiles of mass density @xmath37 , thermal conductivity @xmath38 , and specific heat capacity @xmath39 may be estimated from the above derived thermal inertia . since the thermal conductivity @xmath38 depends on particle size and temperature much more than @xmath37 and @xmath39 , we attempt to assume a constant value for @xmath37 and @xmath39 , and then estimate @xmath38 from the above derived thermal inertia .",
    "next , the estimation of skin depth will be easily acquired .",
    "@xcite has derived the mass density to be @xmath19 g @xmath20 . since the above derived value @xmath99 is similar to that of the moon despite a little higher",
    ", we assume the specific heat capacity of 1996 fg3 is similar to that of the moon , about @xmath100 .",
    "then the thermal conductivity @xmath38 is estimated to be @xmath101 and @xmath102 is @xmath103 .",
    "such small @xmath38 and @xmath102 obviously support the possible existence of loose material or regolith over the surface of 1996 fg3 .",
    "however , the depth of the regolith layer , covered on the asteroid s surface , attracts our great attention .",
    "we carried out simulations to explore the regolith depth versus temperature distribution of sub - surface for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively ( see figure [ regolith ] ) .",
    "the left panels show the results are obtained when the asteroid moves at aphelion , while the right panels exhibit those at perihelion . in each panel ,",
    "two profiles , which are respectively , plotted by solid line ( local midday ) and dashed line ( local midnight ) , show that the sub - surface temperature changes with the depth ( the distance from the surface ) . in these panels ,",
    "the temperature goes down as the depth increases at local noon , while it goes up as the depth increases at local midnight until a certain depth , where two curves are overlapped .",
    "this phenomenon results from the internal boundary equation [ inbc ] .",
    "the figure shows the temperature distribution of the very loose regolith layer , the thermal conductivity of which may be in the range of @xmath101 . and",
    "the minimum depth of this layer may be estimated from figure [ regolith ] .",
    "herein the regolith depth of the very surface of 1996 fg3 is reckoned to be @xmath11 .",
    "this minimum value of regolith depth may be considered as a reference for the design of a spacecraft if a lander is equipped . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of regolith over the surface of the primary of 1996 fg3 actually does good to a sample return mission .",
    "in this work , we have derived a new 3d convex shape model of the primary of 1996 fg3 from the published lightcurves , where the best - fit orientation of its spin axis is determined to be @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with a rotation period of @xmath2 3.5935  h. on the basis of the numerical codes independently developed according to thermophysical model , we apply the shape model and the required input physical parameters to fit three sets of mid - infrared measurements for 1996 fg3 .",
    "herein we summarize the major physical properties obtained for the asteroid as follows : the geometric albedo and effective diameter are , respectively , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ; the diameters of the primary and secondary are calculated to be @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively . moreover ,",
    "the thermal inertia @xmath7 is also determined to be a low value of @xmath8 , whereas the roughness fraction @xmath9 is estimated to be @xmath10 .    from the simulations",
    ", we find that low thermal inertia ( @xmath111 ) would make a perfect fitting to the visir observations on 19 january , 2011 ( with respect to a low phase angle ) , whereas the observations obtained at higher phase angles ( table 3 and 4 ) are very sensitive to @xmath9 , thereby leading to a best - fit solution with the case of large roughness fraction .",
    "given that we simultaneously perform the computation using the combination data ( tables 3,4 and 5 ) , a broad range of @xmath112 profiles are obtained in the fitting . furthermore , to acquire a significant uncertainty for the outcomes , we finally choose a @xmath113 range of the minimum @xmath112 to determine the best - fit solution for thermal inertia of 1996 fg3 . on the other hand , via the simultaneous fitting with these observations at different solar phase angles , the degeneracy of solutions between thermal inertia and roughness is removed , making it capable to determine the estimation for thermal inertia and roughness separately . the ratio of `` observation / model '' ( see figures [ rphase ] and [ rspectra ] ) is a good indicator that examines how the results from the model match the observations at various phase angles and wavelengths @xcite .",
    "hence , this enables us to conclude that the fitting process is correct and the derived results are reliable .    , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "]    , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . ]",
    "according to the atpm fitting results shown in table [ outcome ] , the evaluated large roughness fraction @xmath116 for 1996 fg3 may suggest a rough surface on the asteroid .",
    "however , the asteroid s mean surface thermal inertia is estimated to be a relative low value .",
    "then the question arises  why this asteroid bears such a low thermal inertia with a very rough surface . as the adopted roughness model in the atpm",
    "is assumed to be an irregularity degree of a surface at scales smaller than the global shape model resolution ( like a facet area ) but larger than the thermal skin depth .",
    "therefore , 1996 fg3 would be likely to have a rough surface , which may or may not include craters of any size , and a porous or dusty material .",
    "the recent work of @xcite suggested the surface of 1996 fg3 may be a compact one , with the existence of regions showing different roughness , similar to that of itokawa .",
    "hence , there would be possible for an asteroid to possess a large roughness fraction and low thermal inertia .",
    "however , the nea binaries may have a high averaged thermal inertia of @xmath117 @xcite , indicating that high thermal inertia could be supportive to the binary formation scenario due to yorp mechanism . in this work ,",
    "we have derived thermal inertia @xmath99 for 1996 fg3 , and it appears below their estimation .",
    "nevertheless , it is still likely for a rubble - pile asteroid to have a low thermal inertia , thereby remaining a rough surface during a long dynamical evolution due to space - weathering and regolith migration . in this sense",
    ", the binary 1996 fg3 may also be produced via the yorp rotation acceleration effect at a very earlier time , but retain a roughness surface from then , resulting in the distribution of a great many meter - size ( or even smaller ) craters on the surface .",
    "thus , these tiny craters might be covered or surrounded by loose materials , making it appear a low thermal inertia .",
    "@xcite showed that the average thermal inertia for neas may be @xmath118 .",
    "figure [ inertia - size ] exhibits the variation of mean thermal inertia with the size of asteroids from the observations . from this figure",
    ", we observe that the value of thermal inertia for 1996 fg3 given in this work ( labeled in red ) deviates a little from the prediction profile .",
    "in addition , our outcome for the binary system is a bit lower than that of @xcite .",
    "this results from that we perform the combination fitting with additional thermal - ir observations ( tables 3 and 4 ) , which may provide new insight for the thermal study of binary asteroids .    in conclusion , the surface of 1996 fg3 s",
    "primary may be a very rough surface , on which loose materials such as fine dust , fragmentary rocky debris , sands or most likely a stuff of their mixture are covered , composing a kind of regolith .",
    "the depth of the possible regolith layer is evaluated to be approximately @xmath11 .",
    "such implication may provide substantial information for engineering of the sample return mission , for example , a selection of landing area .",
    "however , we should place special emphasis on that this estimation is simply a roughly minimum value of the regolith layer over the very surface of the asteroid rather than a sort of megaregolith below the layer .",
    "since the thermal conductivity @xmath38 of the megaregolith has a complicated relationship with the depth below the surface @xcite , thereby we can not simulate the temperature distribution accurately from a one - dimension thermophysical model .",
    "on the other hand , the formation mechanism for 1996 fg3 is still a mystery , which the yorp acceleration mechanism may play a role in producing its shape and orbital configuration @xcite . in short ,",
    "the investigations by future space missions will throw new light on the formation scenario for this asteroid .",
