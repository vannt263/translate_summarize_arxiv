    "the of?p class in the galaxy currently consists of five objects ( walborn et al .",
    "the sometimes maligned question mark in their classification , introduced by walborn ( 1972 , 1973 ) , was intended to denote doubt that they are normal of supergiants , as the latter category was being interpreted at the time , because of several relatively subtle spectral peculiarities .",
    "one of them is emission - line profiles narrower than those of the absorption lines , suggesting a circumstellar origin of the former in the peculiar stars , rather than photospheric as in the normal ones .",
    "that morphological distinction was amply vindicated decades later , when 120  kg magnetic fields were discovered in all of the of?p stars ( donati et al .",
    "2006 ; martins et al . 2010",
    "; wade et al .",
    "2011 , 2012a , 2012b , 2015 ; hubrig et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 , 2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "because of obliquity between their magnetic and rotational axes , they display spectacular variations during their rotational cycles , which range from about a week to more than 50  years among the galactic objects , likely determined by spindown as a function of field strength and age , due to angular momentum loss produced by coupling of the magnetic fields to the winds ( `` magnetic braking '' ) .",
    "that is , they are higher - mass analogues of the ap and bp stars , with even more spectacular behaviors because the fields channel the strong stellar winds from opposite hemispheres into a collision at the magnetic equator , forming a thin disk that presents varying aspects .",
    "while on the one hand there is a phenomenological unity among the class because of the basic mechanism , on the other hand the different combinations of multiple parameters also lead to a remarkable diversity of detail .",
    "this diversity among the small number of galactic of?p stars is not merely amusing ; the ranges among their individual parameters provide  separated - variable experiments \" that illuminate the entire class",
    ". clearly further examples of the phenomenon are of considerable interest from that perspective .",
    "the first of?p star in the magellanic clouds was recognized in the smc by walborn et al .",
    "( 2000still before the discovery of their physical nature ! ) ; two more in each cloud have been found since .",
    "they offer the interesting opportunity to investigate magnetic fields and winds of massive stars at lower metallicities . here",
    "we present spectroscopic monitoring of the three objects known for long enough to accomplish that ; two more have been discovered very recently by massey et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and are not further discussed in this paper , although they are included in the companion photometric paper by naz et al .",
    "spectroscopic observations of av220 and 2dfs936 in the smc , and bi57 in the lmc ( designations explained below ) , have been obtained with the boller & chivens spectrograph attached to the 2.5 m du pont telescope at las campanas observatory .",

    "we used a 1200  lines  mm@xmath2 grating centered at 4700    and had the slit width set to 150 microns , corresponding to 126 on the sky and 1.75 pixels on the detector .",
    "this instrumental configuration produces a resolution of @xmath31.7    as measured from the fwhm of the comparison lines . the typical peak signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per 2-pixel resolution element ranges from 150 to 200 , with just a few cases significantly below or above .",
    "all of these data were obtained under the technical auspices of the galactic o - star spectroscopic survey ( gosss ; maz apellniz et al .",
    "2011 ) , and they have been incorporated into the gosss database .",
    "dome flats and bias frames were obtained during the afternoon prior to each observing night as well as twilight flats at sunset , and he - ne - ar comparison - lamp exposures were recorded before or after each target was observed .",
    "reductions were carried out using standard iraf longslit routines .",
    "flux calibration was derived from a set of standard stars observed during the same nights , and the data were then normalized for presentation here .",
    "one observation of av220 , one of 2dfs936 , and two of bi57 were obtained with the magellan echellette ( mage ; marshall et al .",
    "2008 ) at the clay 6.5 m telescope , with a @xmath4 slit , yielding a resolution ranging from 0.7    at 3200    to 1.7    at 10,000   , as measured from the fwhm of the th - ar comparison lines .",
    "the peak s / n per 3-pixel resolution element is 95 for av  220 , 215 for 2dfs  936 , and 140 for bi  57 .",
    "reductions were done with a combination of the iraf _ mtools _ package ( originally designed by jack baldwin to process magellan echelle  mike ",
    "data ) and standard iraf echelle routines , as described by massey et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we also present here one observation of 2dfs936 and one of bi57 obtained by idh and cje with the 2df instrument attached to the anglo - australian telescope ( see lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; evans et al . 2004 ) .",

    "also discussed here for av220 are one observation from caspec at the 3.6 m on eso / la silla ( walborn et al .",

    "all of the galactic of?p stars display distinctive , periodic spectral variations to various degrees , which are reproducible across the rotational cycles for as long as they have been observed ( naz et al .",
    "2001 , 2008 , 2010 ; walborn et al . 2004",
    "; howarth et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the phases of their magnetic extrema correlate with those of the spectral variations , which may be described as maxima and minima in terms of the emission - line intensities .",
    "these variations include the apparent spectral types , with the earlier types due to emission filling at the he  i lines , so that the minima are likely more representative of the actual types . in some objects , the c  iii @xmath54650 emission lines ,",
    "whose comparability to the n  iii @xmath54640 was one of the original criteria for the class , disappear abruptly and completely , as if in an occultation . in some objects , h@xmath6 changes from a strong emission line to an absorption , and comparable profile changes",
    "occur in he  ii @xmath54686 .",
    "higher balmer series members develop variable , narrow p  cygni profiles within the broad stellar absorption lines .",
    "several of?p stars display very small - amplitude light variations that also correlate with the projected magnetic field and emission lines , because scattering electrons believed to produce the photometric maxima are concentrated over the magnetic poles , corresponding to face - on aspects of the disks which maximize the emission - line strengths ( walborn et al .",
    "2004 ; howarth et al .",
    "2007 ; wade et al .",
    "2011 , 2012a , 2015 ) .",
    "here we report precisely these kinds of variations in the spectra of all three of the mc objects discussed , as well as correlations with their light variations , thus essentially establishing their oblique magnetic rotator ( omr ) nature in advance of any magnetic observations . once again , the ongoing power of morphology to discover and characterize phenomena prior to physical measurement and analysis is demonstrated .",

    "provide vital information about the structure of the omr magnetospheres . as discussed above , the field channels the winds from opposite hemispheres into a collision at the magnetic equator , where high - energy phenomena are produced . as the magnetosphere rotates rigidly and obliquely ,",
