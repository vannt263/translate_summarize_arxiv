    "the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method has proven to be quite accurate for calculating the nuclear level density in the range of excitation energies up to several tens of mev  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the smmc method is that it can be used to calculate thermal observables in model spaces that are orders of magnitude larger than can be treated by conventional diagonalization methods . in practice ,",
    "most of the smmc calculations are carried out in truncated spaces ( e.g. , one major shell ) , hence the limitation on the excitation energy .",
    "correlations become less important at higher temperatures , and the results of the truncated smmc calculations can be extended to higher temperatures or excitation energies by taking into account the effects of a larger space in the independent - particle model  @xcite .",
    "the smmc method can also be used to calculate the distribution of nuclear spins at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , this requires spin projection , and the associated computational effort is rather large . for general purposes such as constructing tables for large numbers of nuclei , simplified models are thus invaluable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct and study such a simple model that can reproduce well the spin distributions of the microscopic smmc method .",
    "a common assumption  @xcite in global parameterizations of nuclear level densities is that the spin distribution follows the spin - cutoff model @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the total level density counting all @xmath2 states in a @xmath3 multiplet , while @xmath4 is the density of spin-@xmath3 levels without the @xmath5 degeneracy factor . thus @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is known as the spin cutoff parameter .",
    "the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath7 are all functions of excitation energy .",
    "the model can be derived assuming that the individual nucleon spins add up as independent random vectors  @xcite , @xmath9 , leading to a gaussian distribution of the spin vector @xmath10 . integrating over the orientation of @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 , where j is the magnitude of the angular momentum ( the pre - exponential factor @xmath13 comes from the jacobian in spherical coordinates ) .",
    "we recover eq .",
    "( [ spin - cutoff ] ) by making the semiclassical substitution @xmath14 ; the spin cutoff parameter is then given by @xmath15 in thermal ensembles it is common to define an effective moment of inertia @xmath16 by the relation between @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 , which we can write as @xmath19 in many of the empirical parameterizations , @xmath7 is determined by this formula using for @xmath16 the rigid - body moment of inertia , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 fm is the usual nuclear radius parameter , @xmath22 is the mass number and @xmath23 is the nucleon mass .",
    "other treatments of @xmath7 based on the independent - particle model have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "smmc calculations of nuclei in the @xmath24 mass region show that the assumption of a rigid - body moment of inertia breaks down at low excitation energies starting somewhat below the neutron separation energy , especially in even - even nuclei .",
    "the effect has a clear odd - even mass dependence .",
    "furthermore , at the lowest excitations , deviations are observed from the spin - cutoff model itself , and odd - even staggering effects ( in spin ) can be seen . here",
    "we will show that a fairly simple model based on a fixed deformation and a fluctuating pairing field reproduces very well the detailed smmc results for the effective moment of inertia at finite temperature .",
    "in particular , odd - even effects observed in the microscopic smmc calculations are nicely reproduced by a number - parity projection method  @xcite .",
    "we would therefore advocate this model for global calculations of the spin distributions below the neutron separation energy .",
    "such distributions are needed for theoretical estimates of nucleosynthesis reaction rates  @xcite , among other applications .",
    "our model is based on the static path approximation  @xcite to the bcs hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "bcs theory is valid in the limit when the mean level spacing is much smaller than the pairing gap .",
    "however , this condition does not hold in the finite nucleus , in which case fluctuations must be taken into account .",
    "a similar situation occurs in ultra - small metallic particles whose linear size is smaller than @xmath25 nm  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have indicated that pairing correlations in the crossover from bcs to the fluctuation - dominated regime are manifested through their number - parity dependence .",
    "odd - even effects that originate in pairing correlations were found in the smmc heat capacity of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "such effects were also observed in the heat capacities of rare - earth nuclei that were extracted from level density measurements  @xcite .",
    "finite - temperature pairing correlations at a fixed number of particles were also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first discuss in section [ sec : formal ] general aspects of calculating the thermal moment of inertia and projection on number parity .",
    "we work in a grand canonical ensemble , but the odd - even effects can be extracted by the number - parity projection operator . in section [ sec : model ] , we apply the formalism to a model hamiltonian that includes a deformed single - particle field and a pairing interaction treated in the static path approximation .",
    "this yields a formula for the moment of inertia that is a generalization of the belyaev formula  @xcite for zero temperature , explaining the suppression of the inertia at low temperature . in section",
    "[ sec : number - parity ] , we further generalize the moment - of - inertia formula to take into account odd - even differences , making use of the number - parity projection operator .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] , we apply the model to nuclei in the iron region using the @xmath26 shell with single - particle energies and wave functions determined from a deformed woods - saxon potential .",
    "the calculated moments of inertia are found to be in good agreement with the smmc calculations .",

    "a non - rotational invariant effective hamiltonian arises in the mean - field approximation when the single - particle potential is deformed .",
    "in such a case @xmath32 describes the hamiltonian in the intrinsic frame of the nucleus . the quantity @xmath33 in eq .",

    "( [ inertia3 ] ) expresses the effective moment of inertia @xmath16 in terms of the intrinsic principal moments @xmath48 .",
    "the calculations in the previous section [ sec : inertia ] were described in the grand - canonical ensemble . while this allows the average number of particles to be specified , it is not precise enough to reproduce odd - even effects .",
    "we note that the behavior of odd and even nuclei at low temperatures is quite different ; the spin goes to zero for even nuclei due to pairing , but remains finite at zero temperature for odd nuclei .",
    "exact particle - number projection can be done using the projection operator @xmath49 as in the smmc , but leads to cumbersome expressions .",
    "in order to capture the main odd - even effects , it is often sufficient to use a number - parity projection  @xcite that distinguishes only between even and odd number of particles .",
    "the number - parity projection is defined by [ np - projector ] p_= 12 ( 1 + e^in ) , where @xmath50 or -1 describes the projection on an even or odd number of particles , respectively .",
    "thus , the number - parity projected partition function is [ projected - partition ] z_= tr ( p_e^-h ) = 12 z , where the bracket denotes a thermal trace , @xmath51 .",

    "we now ask , starting from the independent - particle shell model , what is the minimal model that will include the most relevant interaction effects for calculating the spin distribution . clearly , the most important correlations are those associated with the quadrupole deformation and the pairing field . both of these can be treated in a mean - field approximation , but the mean - field equations predict sharp transitions that are not supported by more detailed theories .",
    "thus we go one step further in the finite - temperature theory , using the static path approximation ( spa )  @xcite of the partition function to include time - independent fluctuations of the order parameters .",

    "[ fig4 ] but plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "in general , the thermal moment of inertia is seen to decrease with decreasing temperature with stronger suppression in the even isotopes .",

    "it is interesting to note that a similar odd - even effect was found in the spin susceptibility of ultra - small metallic particles ( nanoparticles )  @xcite .",
    "the rise of the spin susceptibility at low temperatures for an odd number of electrons is known as re - entrant behavior and survives in the fluctuation - dominated regime .    finally , in fig .",

    "the model includes quadrupolar deformation of the single - particle field and pairing interaction .",
    "the pairing interaction is treated beyond the mean - field bcs limit by including static fluctuations in the pairing order parameter at finite temperature .    in the fluctuation - dominated regime ,",
    "finite temperature signatures of pairing correlations are often observed as odd - even effects ( in particle number )  @xcite .",
    "such signatures are usually not seen in the grand - canonical ensemble , but only after particle - number projection is implemented ( such as in smmc ) . in this work",
    "we have used number - parity projection instead of exact particle - number projection and showed that the odd - even effects in the moment of inertia seen in the microscopic smmc calculations can be well reproduced .",
    "the advantage of such number - parity projection is its simplicity , which allows us to express the projected moment of inertia in essentially closed form ( except for an integral over the pairing field ) .",
    "the simple model developed here is useful in estimating the spin distribution of nuclear level densities at not - too - low temperatures for which the spin - cutoff model usually works well .",
