    "<S> we propose an experiment to search for extra  hidden - sector \" u(1 ) gauge bosons with gauge kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon , predicted by many extensions of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the setup consists of a highly sensitive magnetometer inside a superconducting shielding . </S>",
    "<S> this is then placed inside a strong ( but sub - critical ) magnetic field . in ordinary electrodynamics </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field can not permeate the superconductor and no field should register on the magnetometer . however , photon  hidden - sector photon  </S>",
    "<S> photon oscillations would allow to penetrate the superconductor and the magnetic field would `` leak '' into the shielded volume and register on the magnetometer . </S>",
    "<S> although this setup resembles a classic `` light shining though a wall experiment '' there are two crucial differences . </S>",
    "<S> first , the fields are ( nearly ) static and the photons involved are virtual . </S>",
    "<S> second , the magnetometer directly measures the field - strength and not a probability . </S>",
    "<S> this improves the dependence of the signal on the kinetic mixing @xmath0 to @xmath1 instead of @xmath2 . in the mass range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 the projected sensitivity is in the @xmath4 to @xmath5 range . </S>",
    "<S> this surpasses current astrophysical and laboratory limits by several orders of magnitude  ample room to discover new physics .    in the near future </S>",
    "<S> the lhc will commence searching for new particles with masses of the order of a tev . </S>",
    "<S> this will test many proposed extensions of the standard model as , e.g. , supersymmetry , large extra dimensions , technicolor to name only a few . </S>",
    "<S> however , many extensions of the standard model contain additional hidden sectors that interact only very weakly with ordinary matter . due to their feeble interactions even light particles in such hidden sectors </S>",
    "<S> may be missed in such a collider experiment . yet </S>",
    "<S> , it may be exactly these hidden sectors that carry crucial information on how the standard model is embedded in a more fundamental theory . </S>",
    "<S> this creates the need for complementary experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> one interesting class of hidden - sector particles is extra u(1 ) gauge bosons . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , many string theory models contain hidden - sector u(1)s under which standard model particles are uncharged . at low energies , </S>",
    "<S> the only renormalizable interaction with the visible sector can occur via mixing  @xcite of the photon @xmath6 with the hidden sector photon @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> current experimental bounds are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ exclu ] . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly there is a dip in the sensitivity in the mass region around @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> hidden - sector photons in this mass region could , e.g. , explain @xcite the slight excess in the number of relativistic species observed in combinations of cmb with lyman-@xmath9 data @xcite ( although this could also be due to systematics @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one might ( wildly ) speculate about possible connections to neutrino masses and dark energy which incidentally also have energy scales around mev . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment proposed in this note is designed to search for hidden - sector photons exactly in this region .     and the blackbody nature of the spectrum ( black ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> improvements of the solar bounds can be achieved using the superkamiokande detector or upgrading the cast experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the region @xmath10 could be tested by an experiment using microwave cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lightly shaded areas bounded by lines give the projected sensitivity for the experiment proposed in this note . </S>",
    "<S> the blue area corresponds to a relatively conservative estimate for the magnetometer sensitivity @xmath11 , and a thickness of the shielding @xmath12  much greater than the theoretical minimum required to have sufficient an external field of @xmath13 is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> the red area is an optimistic scenario , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for both scenarios we used @xmath17 for the distance from the magnetic field source to the shield and @xmath18 for the distance from the shield to the magnetometer . ) </S>",
    "<S> [ exclu],width=8 ]    the basic idea of the proposed experiment is very similar to a classic `` light shining through a wall experiment '' . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of light it uses a static magnetic field and the wall is replaced by superconducting shielding ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ magnet ] ) . outside the shielding </S>",
    "<S> we have a strong magnetic field . upon entering the superconductor the ordinary electromagnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is exponentially damped with a length scale given by the london penetration depth @xmath19 . yet , </S>",
    "<S> due to the photon  </S>",
    "<S> hidden photon mixing a small part of the magnetic field is converted into a hidden magnetic field . after the superconducting shield is crossed the mixing turns a small fraction of the hidden magnetic field back into an ordinary magnetic field that can be detected by a magnetometer . since the magnetometer measures directly the field ( and not some probability or power output ) the signal is proportional to the transition amplitude and therefore to the mixing squared , @xmath1 , instead of being proportional to @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=8 ]    let us start from the lagrangian describing the photon  hidden - sector photon system at low energies , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the field strength tensor for the ordinary electromagnetic u(1)@xmath22 gauge field @xmath23 , @xmath24 is its associated current ( generated by electrons , etc . ) and @xmath25 is the field strength for the hidden - sector u(1)@xmath26 field @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the first two terms are the standard kinetic terms for the photon and hidden photon fields , respectively . because the field strength itself is gauge invariant for u(1 ) gauge fields , the third term is also allowed by gauge and lorentz symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this term corresponds to a non - diagonal kinetic term , a so - called kinetic mixing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this term is a renormalizable dimension four term and does not suffer from mass suppressions . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore a sensitive probe for physics at very high energies . </S>",
    "<S> kinetic mixing arises in field theoretic @xcite as well as in string theoretic setups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical predicted values for @xmath28 in realistic string compactifications range between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the second to last term is a mass term for the hidden photon . </S>",
    "<S> this could either arise from a higgs mechanism or it could be a stckelberg mass term  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the last term corresponds to the london mass @xmath31 the photon acquires inside a superconductor . in vacuum @xmath32 .    from this lagrangian </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the equations of motion , @xmath33 here , we have chosen lorentz gauge for the massless field ( if @xmath34 ) and used that the lorentz condition is automatically enforced for massive fields .    due to the kinetic mixing , a source @xmath35 originating from purely standard model fields , i.e. typically electrons , will automatically generate also a small @xmath27 field : very close to a localized source the the field equations are dominated by the derivative terms and the mass terms can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly the second equation in can only be fulfilled if the generated field is proportional to @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> having said this , we will drop the source from now on .    </S>",
    "<S> taking appropriate derivatives in we get the equations for the field strengths , @xmath37 the essential features can be studied by using an one - dimensional setup : the superconductor fills the 2 - 3-plane and has a thickness @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the distances from the source of the magnetic field to the superconducting plane and from there to the detector will be called @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that the different space - time components of eq . decouple and </S>",
    "<S> fulfill the same equations so essentially we can drop the spacetime indices . as an example let us choose a static magnetic field in the 3 direction , i.e. only the 12 components are non - vanishing , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we find , @xmath43 outside the superconductor @xmath34 and to lowest non - trivial order in @xmath28 the non - growing solutions are , @xmath44 in the @xmath45 basis . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , close to the source the magnetic field will be @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can now see that the small @xmath47 component is exponentially damped . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , after a distance @xmath48 , the field is @xmath49 and will stay that way until it reaches the superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> inside the superconductor the solutions are , @xmath50 note that @xmath51 is damped with @xmath52 and not @xmath53 . for @xmath54 the mainly hidden photon like @xmath55 can therefore `` leak '' through the superconducting shielding </S>",
    "<S> .    therefore , for @xmath56 ( distant source ) and using @xmath57 for simplicity , we have @xmath58 for @xmath57 and @xmath59 only the component @xmath60 effectively penetrates the shielding and @xmath61 at a distance @xmath62 after the shielding only the @xmath63 component survives and the measurable ordinary magnetic field approaches @xmath64 .    keeping somewhat more carefully track of the exponentials we find , @xmath65 \\left[1-e^{-{m_{\\gamma^{\\prime}}}l_2}\\right]\\ . </S>",
    "<S> \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first part is the standard `` leaking '' expected from the finite thickness of the superconducting shielding , and constitutes the standard model background . </S>",
    "<S> the second part @xmath66 is the signal caused by the hidden photons . </S>",
    "<S> the first exponential arises from the damping of the hidden photon field inside the superconducting shield whereas the terms in brackets account for the fact that the conversion of photons into hidden photons and vice versa takes place over length scales @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of @xmath68 and @xmath47 from the source to the detector is sketched in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ evo ] .     </S>",
    "<S> ( blue ) and hidden magnetic field @xmath47 ( red ) as a function of the distance from the source ( @xmath69 ) in our 1-dimensional set up . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities are normalized to the value @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line represents the evolution of @xmath68 in absence of the hidden field ( @xmath71 ) . near the external ( left ) surface of the superconducting shield </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 changes sign , from negative to positive . for better visibility </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen not too extreme values @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath76 the evolution approaches @xmath1 , but for the chosen parameters the result is a bit smaller because the hidden field is a bit damped inside the shielding due to @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> [ evo],width=8 ]    let us now turn to the sensitivity of such an experiment . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field strengths @xmath77 of the order @xmath78 can be reached in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have to stay below the critical field strength of the superconductor . in most materials </S>",
    "<S> this ranges between @xmath79 and @xmath80  @xcite although fields as high as @xmath81 t can be shielded in certain cases ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> , e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> modern magnetometers @xcite can can detect magnetic fields as low as @xmath82 and @xmath83 seems relatively conservative . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly we can expect a sensitivity in the @xmath5 to @xmath84 range magnetic field down to @xmath85 might be an experimental challenge ( see , however , @xcite ) . ] . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the use of squids as magnetometers a comment is in order . </S>",
    "<S> squids can only measure _ changes _ in the magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> two possibilities to solve this problem are to modulate the strength of the external magnetic field or to change its direction ( for example by rotating it ) . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the timescale for the change in the magnetic field is long compared to @xmath86 the above considerations remain unchanged . in addition , time - modulated magnetic fields might also be helpful in reducing the background .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have to ask which mass scales we can probe in the experiment . from we can read off that optimal sensitivity requires @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> typical london penetration depths @xmath88 are of the order of @xmath89 ( cf , . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , @xcite ) . to avoid fields leaking directly through the shielding ( without having to convert into hidden fields ) at the @xmath90 level we need @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement @xmath92 then allows , in principle , to search for masses up to @xmath93 . with thicker than the minimal required shielding </S>",
    "<S> the experiment will be sensitive only to smaller masses . finally , the maximal size of the magnetic field and the shielded volume will typically be of the order @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a lower limit @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> overall we have , @xmath96 two examples for the expected sensitivity are shown in fig . [ exclu ] .    _ in conclusion : _ we have proposed a simple experiment to search for massive hidden photons . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment could improve upon existing bounds by several orders of magnitude in a mass range @xmath97 where existing bounds are relatively weak . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore bears significant discovery potential for hidden sector physics at the mev scale . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it could test recent speculations @xcite that the excess in the observed number of relativistic degrees of freedom at decoupling of the cmb originates from a resonant production of hidden photons in the early universe . </S>"
