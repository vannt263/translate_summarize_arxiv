    "the bl  lac object mkn501 ( 1652 + 398 , j1653 + 3945 , da426 ) has been well - studied at radio wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but interest in the source was rejuvenated by the discovery of tev gamma - ray emission @xcite . a prolonged high - state at tev energies in 1997 included activity on timescales of several hours , implying the tev gamma - rays originate in a relatively compact area ( see , e.g. , the review of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the detection of correlated x - ray and tev gamma - ray variability in the other well - studied tev source , mkn421 , is strong evidence in favor of the x - ray emission being the high end of the synchrotron component of the spectral energy distribution , with the tev emission arising from inverse compton scattering of photons by the synchrotron emitting electrons , and such a model is also widely accepted for mkn501 .    on the parsec scale",
    ", vlbi observations have revealed that a jet emerges from the core at a position angle of @xmath2180@xmath3 , and bends by @xmath290@xmath3 within the first @xmath22milli - arcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "the jet extends to the east until @xmath220mas from the core , when it bends further , finally reaching the position angle of @xmath245@xmath3 seen on the kilo - parsec scale @xcite .",
    "the parsec - scale jet of mkn501 is one - sided , and it is assumed that this jet is relativistically doppler boosted , while the counter - jet is doppler de - boosted to such an extent it is invisible at the current sensitivity of vlbi observations .",
    "the jets are believed to originate in the accretion disk surrounding a central super - massive black hole , which for mkn501 has been suggested to have a mass of 10@xmath4m@xmath5 ( falomo , kotilainen & treves 2002 ) .",
    "a number of different motions have been reported for components in the mkn501 jet , ranging from 0.27@xmath60.02masyr@xmath7 @xcite to 2.4masyr@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these studies have relied on only a small number of epochs , typically less than four , and , in hindsight , have probably under - estimated the errors in locating jet components .",
    "as illustrated by @xcite for mkn421 , reliable determination of component motions generally requires larger , multi - epoch data sets .",

    ", we conservatively adopted half a projected beamwidth for the uncertainty . for c2 and c3 we used one quarter of the projected beamwidth , and for the innermost component , c4 , we used one - eighth of the beamwidth .",
    "motions were determined by weighted linear fits to the data .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , both c1 and c4 show little evidence of motion over the 4.28year period . both c2 and",
    "c3 show clear evidence of motion , with an apparent component speeds for c2 of 0.6@xmath60.1@xmath12 , and for c3 of 0.3@xmath60.1@xmath12 .",
    "the apparent speeds along the jet , as opposed to radial separations , are , within errors , the same .",
    "these speeds supersede the preliminary values reported in @xcite .",
    "our component locations agree well with those reported from a contemporaneous 5ghz observation made in june 1996 as part of the vlba pre - launch survey @xcite .",
    "we can also extrapolate our derived motions and compare them with model - fits to the 5ghz observations at epochs 1987.4 @xcite , and 1989.3 @xcite .",
    "the extrapolated motion of c3 is consistent with the positions of the k2 of @xcite and @xcite , assuming uncertainties @xmath23 times larger than the @xmath60.1mas adopted by these workers .",
    "the k1 of @xcite and @xcite , with similarly increased uncertainties , is consistent with the extrapolated motion of c2 , particularly if the speed of c2 lies at the lower end of the range determined in  3 ( assuming a constant motion ) .",
    "these identifications were qualitatively suggested by @xcite , but are quantitatively borne out by the fuller analysis presented here .",
    "the speeds of c4 and c1 are formally consistent with zero , i.e.  they appear to be stationary components . before considering this further , we reconcile this result for c4 with the observations of @xcite , who reported the detection at 22ghz of a resolved component between 0.5 and 1mas from the core , with an apparent motion derived from three epochs between april and august 1997 of 0.96@xmath60.1masyr@xmath7 , corresponding to 2.3@xmath60.2@xmath12 .",
    "this location is consistent with our c4 , however we do not see such rapid motion over the four year period .",
    "the motion reported by marscher corresponds to 0.27mas in the 0.29 years the observations spanned . in our data , c4 ranges between 0.59mas from the core ( 1998 april  7 ) and 0.83mas from the core ( 1999 july  19 ) , a range of 0.21mas , similar in magnitude to that of @xcite .",
    "any attempt at further interpretation is complicated by the fact that there are likely to be frequency - dependent offsets in the separation of components from the core ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our data , which would be most important for c4 .",
    "stationary components have been reported for a number of sources in the past , with a detailed study being made as part of the multi - epoch monitoring program of @xcite .",
    "the monitoring revealed that the super - luminal speeds detected for these of egret - detected blazars were much faster than for the general population of bright compact radio sources , however evidence was also found for at least one stationary component in 27 of the 42 sources @xcite .",
    "jorstad et al .  suggested that the stationary components within several parsecs of the core were associated with standing recollimation shocks caused by pressure imbalances at the boundary between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "in contrast , the stationary components further from the core tended to be associated with bends in the parsec - scale jet .",
    "there is support for this scenario in our data .",
    "c4 is located at a projected distance of @xmath20.5pc from the core , and is quite plausibly associated with a recollimation shock .",
    "c1 , on the other hand , is an extended component , which 1.6ghz vlbi imaging has revealed is associated with a significant change in the jet from a bright `` spine '' to a limb - brightened morphology @xcite .",
    "if we assume our fastest observed pattern speed ( 0.6@xmath12 for c2 ) reflects the bulk apparent speed of the jet , then we can solve for the intrinsic speed and angle to the line - of - sight , provided we also have an estimate of the doppler beaming factor .",
    "a doppler factor @xmath13 is inferred from the tev observations of this source ( e.g. , tavecchio , maraschi , & ghisellini 1998 ) .",
    "the vsop observations yield our best measurement of the radio - core brightness temperature , 4@xmath14k .",
    "this is consistent with a doppler factor of @xmath210 if the source is in equipartition @xcite , but it is also consistent with lower doppler factors if equipartition is violated @xcite .",
    "if we accept the values of 0.6@xmath12 and 10 for the apparent bulk speed and doppler factor , then the lorentz factor of the mkn501 jet is @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and its angle to the line - of - sight is @xmath17 .",
    "such a small angle to the line - of - sight may be expected of a @xmath18-ray blazar , although subluminal apparent speeds are in general not expected ( see the monte carlo simulations of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternative kinematics that do not place such tight constraints on the angle to the line - of - sight assign the doppler factor measurement to the tev - emitting region ( on the light - day size scale ) and the apparent bulk speed to the vlbi jet ( on the light - year size scale ) , and allow a change in the bulk lorentz factor or angle to the line - of - sight in the intermediate region .",
    "if the jet in the tev - emitting region has , e.g. , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( enforcing @xmath21 ) , then a decrease in the lorentz factor to @xmath22 would reproduce the observed apparent speed in the vlbi jet .",
    "such a deceleration of electron - positron jets close to the core is proposed by @xcite for the tev blazars . a change in angle to the line - of - sight , perhaps accompanying the large bend in the jet seen @xmath22mas from the core , can not by itself reproduce the observed values ; a jet with @xmath21 has a minimum lorentz factor of 5 , and a jet with @xmath15 can only have an apparent speed of 0.6@xmath12 in the large - angle solution for @xmath23 .",
    "any set of kinematic parameters must also be constrained by the one - sided appearance of the source ; the example above with @xmath19 and @xmath22 would have a jet - to - counterjet brightness ratio greater than @xmath2200 , somewhat higher than the limit that can be placed from our observations .",
    "similar values for the doppler factor and apparent jet speed apply to the other well - studied tev blazar , mkn 421 @xcite .",
    "from these two sources , it appears that tev blazars as a class may either have very small angles to the line - of - sight ( @xmath24 ) , or may decelerate significantly between the tev - emitting region and the parsec scale .",
    "it is notable that no new component has emerged from the core after the prolonged tev high - state in 1997 .",
    "a component with a speed similar to that of c2 or c3 would now be @xmath20.5mas from the core and would have been detected at the latter epochs .",
    "this suggests that events which give rise to extended tev ( and associated x - ray ) activity are different in nature to those which result in the production of new vlbi components ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "mkn421 and mkn501 , for which the inverse - compton component of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks at tev energies , have sub - luminal component speeds and apparently no new component emerging after epochs of tev activity . in contrast , sources with the inverse - compton component of the sed peaking at gev energies tend to have the emergence of new , super - luminal , vlbi components associated with gev flaring states @xcite .",
    "the detection of more tev gamma - ray sources by the next generation of air cerenkov telescopes will enable these apparent trends to be investigated more quantitatively .",
    "this research has made use of the united states naval observatory radio reference frame image database ( rrfid ) , and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
