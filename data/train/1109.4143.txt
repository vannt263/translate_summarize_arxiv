    "a second peak is in the mir , associated with broad spectral curvature declining towards the near - ir and to the radio .",
    "we discuss below that this curvature is likely to be emission from the compact jet , with the wise w12 bands preferentially probing optically - thin radiation . thus fitting a two - power - law model ( one for the optically - thin jet and one for the ouv ) over the w2uv frequency range yields a mean optically - thin spectral slope @xmath34=0.730.24 , and a largely unconstrained ouv slope @xmath35=@xmath361.30.9 . fitting a single optically - thick power - law to the radio ",

    "we extracted light curves of randomly - selected field stars for comparison . for each band , two field stars with brightness similar to gx 3394 within 5@xmath43 were selected .",
    "variations in the target light curves are clearly much stronger than the field star variations and also display inter - band correlations , implying that they are not related to any instrumental or observational artifact .",

    "both the timing and spectral properties strongly favor a jet origin for the mid - infrared emission .",
    "the mean optically - thick and thin slopes are fairly typical for binaries in the hard state when the jet is known to be strong . from closely - simultaneous x - ray and mir light curves , we find @xmath46@xmath47@xmath45 when comparing similar timescales .",
    "this argues against strong mir variations originating via reprocessing , because the secondary ( driven ) variability can not exceed the primary ones in strength .",
    "x - ray variations can also be ruled out as the driver of ir variations in the outer disk because the ir spectral slopes are inconsistent with thermal reprocessing .",
    "dusty circumbinary disks found in some other sources @xcite are unlikely here because of the strong variability ( so dust grains should be destroyed by x - rays ) , and the mir spectral slopes do not match thermal dust emission .",
    "the strong variability implies dramatic changes in spectral slope across the wise bands in the individual observation epochs .",
    "these are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : epochseds ] . parametrizing the spectra with single power - laws results in slopes of @xmath48@xmath00.5 to + 0.2 ( table  [ tab : wisemags ] ) . in several",
    "epochs , additional spectral curvature appears to be present within the wise bands . in particular , in epochs 12 and 13 , w1 and w4 fluxes lie below the fit ( while w23 lie above ) , returning large single - power - law null - hypothesis rejection probabilities ( @xmath49 ) . from w2 to w1 ,",
    "the slope is negative in most epochs ( @xmath50=0.480.07 ) , meaning that these bands probe mostly optically - thin emission . thus carrying out a simple two - power - law fit to describe the w1 & w2 band - pair and the w3 & w4 pair separately , the spectral break associated with this curvature is constrained to be at log ( ; hz)=13.650.24 and 13.680.26 in epochs 12 and 13 , respectively .",
    "the position of  depends strongly on the magnetic field strength ( @xmath9 ) at the acceleration zone in the compact jet , and is comparatively insensitive to luminosity , geometry and energy partition factors .",
    "generalizing the homogeneous cylindrical single - zone emission model of @xcite , we find expressions for @xmath9 and the zone radius @xmath51 as follows .        where @xmath54=(2@xmath38 + 13)@xmath4 , @xmath55 is the equipartition fraction of particles to magnetic energy density , @xmath56 is the scale - height of the optically - thin region , @xmath57 is the distance in units of 8 kpc , and @xmath58=70 mjy .",
    "since @xmath9 depends only weakly on @xmath56 and @xmath55 ( we fix both at 1 ) , we have a robust estimate of @xmath9 when  can be measured .",
    "both epochs 12 and 13 imply @xmath9@xmath61.5(0.8)@xmath210@xmath10 g and @xmath51@xmath62.5(1.5)@xmath210@xmath59 cm , with errors determined from monte carlo sampling of all parameters ( including also systematic distance uncertainty of 2 kpc ) .",
    "in addition , the strong mir slope changes between optically - thick and thin imply that  is varying over a range at least as wide as that which wise is sensitive to .",

    ", we compare two extreme wise epochs : 1 ) epoch 4 , with very bright flux in w4 and a steep slope implying optically - thin emission over the whole wise range ; 2 ) epoch 8 , when the source was faintest in w4 with an inverted slope implying that  has shifted to the high frequency end .",

    "the dereddened fluxes are @xmath61(4)@xmath6115 mjy and @xmath61(8)@xmath650 mjy . comparing @xmath9 and @xmath51 ,",
    "we find        modulations by factors of @xmath010 in the field strength or in acceleration zone size are required .",
    "the standard scaling of the @xmath9 field along the jet is @xmath9@xmath0@xmath51@xmath4 @xcite which , if true , is consistent with the variability being dominated by changes in location of the acceleration zone along the jet .",

    "multiwavelength monitoring coordinated with the mid - infrared opens up the possibility for studying these processes in the future .",
    "the characteristic timescales of change are @xmath0hours or less ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] ) , though variability between epochs 3 and 4 means that some changes are faster than @xmath011 s.    simultaneous multiband observations over a broad frequency range with wise have proved crucial for revealing complex and rapid changes occurring near the jet base . based on the average data in fig .",

    "we have cleanly probed jet - dominant mir emission simultaneously in multiple bands and shown that inferences from long - term averages are not representative of the underlying behavior in gx 3394 , at least .",

    "<S> many x - ray binaries remain undetected in the mid - infrared , a regime where emission from their compact jets is likely to dominate . here , we report the detection of the black hole binary gx 3394 with the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) during a very bright , hard accretion state in 2010 . combined with a rich contemporaneous multiwavelength dataset , clear spectral curvature is found in the infrared , associated with the peak flux density expected from the compact jet . </S>",
    "<S> an optically - thin slope of @xmath00.7 and a jet radiative power of @xmath16@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 are measured . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath024  h wise light curve shows dramatic variations in mid - infrared spectral slope on timescales at least as short as the satellite orbital period @xmath095 mins . </S>",
    "<S> there is also significant change during one pair of observations spaced by only 11  s. these variations imply that the spectral break associated with the transition from self - absorbed to optically - thin jet synchrotron radiation must be varying across the full wavelength range of @xmath0322  that wise is sensitive to , and more . </S>",
    "<S> based on four - band simultaneous mid - infrared detections , the break is constrained to frequencies of @xmath64.6@xmath710@xmath8 hz in at least two epochs of observation , consistent with a magnetic field @xmath9@xmath61.5(0.8)@xmath210@xmath10 g assuming a single - zone synchrotron emission region . the observed variability implies that either @xmath9 , or the size of the acceleration zone above the jet base , are being modulated by factors of @xmath010 on relatively - short timescales .    </S>",
