    "in this section , we provide a detailed proof of the lieb - robinson bound ( lrb ) for the spin - boson lattice models .",
    "let us start by defining the system under study , which we refer to as the _ spin - boson lattice model _",
    "the lattice will be described by an undirected graph @xmath172 with a set of vertices @xmath173 where the physical degrees of freedom are defined , and an edge set @xmath174 which describes neighbourhood relations in the lattice .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom of each vertex @xmath175 are defined in the hilbert space @xmath176 which combines an infinite - dimensional hilbert space for the bosons , @xmath177 , with a hilbert space @xmath178 of finite dimension @xmath179 for the `` spins '' ( see fig .",
    "[ sblm_scheme ] ) .",
    "the bosons are represented by harmonic oscillators , whose positions and momenta are grouped into a vector @xmath180 where @xmath8 stands for the number of vertices in the graph @xmath181 . in this work , we will set @xmath182 , and rescale the position and momentum operators such that they become dimensionless .",
    "accordingly , the components of the vector @xmath183 obey the usual canonical commutation relations @xmath184 = -{{\\rm i}}\\delta_{ij } j,\\ ] ] where @xmath185 , @xmath186 is the kronecker delta , and we have defined @xmath187 in terms of a pauli matrix .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are represented by a set of dimensionless operators @xmath15 that form a lie algebra . for concreteness ,",
    "we start by assuming that they form a representation of @xmath153 with commutation relations @xmath188 = { { \\rm i}}\\delta_{ij } \\sum_{\\gamma } f^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } s_i^\\gamma , \\ ] ] where @xmath189 label the different spin components , and @xmath155 is defined in terms of the completely antisymmetric levi - civita symbol @xmath190 . however , let us remark that the lrb derived below also applies to more general lie algebras , as far as the structure constants @xmath16 are completely antisymmetric ( see below ) .     represented by red , green and yellow dots . in the two insets ,",
    "we depict the spin @xmath191 and bosonic @xmath192 physical degrees of freedom by discrete levels and a quadratic well , respectively .",
    "the links of the lattice correspond to the edges of the graph @xmath193 , and are represented as springs leading to the coupling @xmath194 between distant oscillators . we also represent the on - site magnetic - field @xmath195 under which the spin precess , and the spin - boson coupling @xmath196 . the blue region mimics the propagation of a spin perturbation at @xmath197 , until it reaches a distant spin @xmath198 . ]    the dynamics of this spin - boson lattice , and thus the lrb , will depend on a particular choice for the hamiltonian .",
    "motivated by its applicability in different physical contexts ( e.g. condensed matter ) , we will consider that bosons at distant lattice sites are coupled by a matrix @xmath199 whose elements have the units of frequency ( i.e. recall that @xmath200 ) , and fulfil @xmath201 whenever the two vertices @xmath185 are connected through an edge of the graph .",
    "the spins precess under a general magnetic field @xmath18 , which might be time - dependent @xmath202 , and also has the units of frequency .",
    "finally , the coupling between spins and bosons is purely local ( i.e. it takes place exclusively at the same vertex of the graph ) , and is defined through the matrices @xmath203 that also have the units of frequency . altogether , the hamiltonian of the spin - boson lattice model is @xmath204    once the model has been defined , let us state the problem under study .",
    "our objective is to understand how correlations are established between distant spins in the lattice , and to derive a bound on how fast this process can take place .",
    "since distant spins do not interact directly , spin - spin interactions and thus spin correlations can only be mediated by the exchange of bosons , which form an array of coupled oscillators .",
    "this situation is common in physics , where bosons act as carriers of the fundamental interactions between particles .",
    "therefore , we believe that the results derived in this work are general enough to be of qualitative interest to a wide variety of systems . moreover , we will present a detailed description to argue that these results are also of quantitative importance for crystals of trapped ions , a system in the field of quantum optics that offers a playground where our ideas can be tested experimentally .    following the tradition of lieb - robinson bounds  @xcite , we will study the so - called lieb - robinson commutators , whose expectation value corresponds to a retarded spin - spin correlation function for a particular state .",
    "such a commutator relates a perturbation at site @xmath205 and instant @xmath206 , with an observable at a distant site @xmath207 and @xmath208 , namely @xmath209,\\label{correlators}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 .",
    "since the spins are coupled to the bosons , we shall also have to consider the correlations between spin and bosonic operators , which are related to the following lieb - robinson commutator @xmath210.\\ ] ] the objective of this work is to derive a bound for the norm of the lieb - robinson spin commutator @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a certain function that depends on the distance @xmath213 between the two lattice sites , and that also depends on time . since for any state of the system , the retarded spin correlation function fulfils @xmath214\\big\\rangle |\\leq{\\ensuremath{\\left\\vert{{\\mathbf{z}}_{jk}(t)}\\right\\vert}}_{\\infty}:={\\rm max}_{\\rm \\beta}{\\ensuremath{\\left\\vert{{z}^\\beta_{jk}(t)}\\right\\vert } } ,   \\label{correlator}\\ ] ] we can also interpret that the function @xmath215 in the lrb   contains information on how fast the spin correlations are established as the perturbation travels with a certain speed @xmath23 across the distance @xmath213 .      in order to study the commutators in eq .",
    "( [ correlators ] ) , we will work with the heisenberg picture . in this picture ,",
    "the time evolution of any operator @xmath216 is given by the following differential equation @xmath217 $ ] .",
    "using the commutations relations in eqs .   and",
    ", we arrive at the following system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the boson and spin operators @xmath218 where @xmath42 is a matrix of operators depending on the representation for the spins . for our particular choice",
    ", it can be written as @xmath219 which can be easily shown to be hermitian @xmath220 .",
    "the first equation ( [ interaction - r ] ) describes a set of coupled harmonic oscillators , where the spins act as a `` source '' term for the bosonic operators .",
    "this equation can be formally integrated ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : lr - harmonic ] ) as @xmath221 where we have used the propagator for the free bosons @xmath222 .",
    "according to the notation above , we may regard @xmath222 as an @xmath44 block matrix , such that each of the blocks is a @xmath223 matrix @xmath224 that couples the oscillators at sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    following our results described in sect .",
    "[ sec : lr - harmonic ] , which constitute an improvement with respect to the work of m. cramer _",
    "@xcite , the norm of these propagators can be bounded by @xmath225^\\eta }    = : \\alpha e^{\\nu_{\\rm lr } |t - t_0| } f(d_{jk } ) , \\label{eq : harmonic - bound2}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the so - called lieb - robinson speed , which determines the maximum rate of propagation of bosonic perturbations in the lattice .",
    "note that this expression includes a more than exponential suppression for @xmath226 and a long - distance attenuation of @xmath227 for @xmath228 due to the possibly long - range interactions in the oscillator couplings @xmath229 , a situation that will become evident when discussing the trapped - ion realisation .",
    "the only property that we will use is the fact that the spatial modulation @xmath230 can be summed in the following way @xmath231 < + \\infty ,    \\label{definition_a_0}\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as a bound on the convolution function and is used in different proofs of lrbs  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath228 and one selects @xmath84 as the graph distance ( i.e. number of edges forming the shortest path connecting the two vertices @xmath185 ) , it is possible to estimate @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the riemann zeta function , and @xmath234 is a constant that depends on the particular graph of dimension @xmath235  @xcite . such a constant can be determined by bounding the maximum number of vertices @xmath236 in a sphere of radius @xmath237 , namely @xmath238 .",
    "let us remark , however , that the lrb can be made tighter for the type of lattices realised by the ion crystals , where the euclidean distance arises naturally , and will allow us to substitute @xmath239 .",
    "the second equation  ( [ interaction - s ] ) describes the precession of the spins under the operator @xmath240 which , in addition to the effects of the external magnetic field , includes also the feedback from the bosonic subsystem .",
    "an important property used below is that the hermiticity of @xmath240 implies that this operator can be regarded as the generator of unitary rotations @xmath52 , namely @xmath241    let us note that this crucial property relies on the particular @xmath153 commutation relations . in a more general case , where the matrices @xmath242 have arbitrary dimension @xmath179 , we may regard these matrices as acting on a subspace of a larger hilbert space , @xmath243 . in this even - sized space ,",
    "we can find a set of hermitian generators @xmath244 that form a complete basis for the observable .",
    "the commutator of any two generators will depend , once more , on an antisymmetric tensor ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which results from the composition of levi - civita symbols .",
    "thanks to this fact , we can still prove that the operator @xmath42 is the product of hermitian operators ( @xmath245 ) and a set of hermitian matrices , obtaining , once more , that @xmath52 is unitary .",
    "since we are actually interested in the commutators in eqs .  - , we will write down their corresponding time - evolution equations .",
    "note that @xmath246 is not zero since the source terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq - source ] ) introduce feedback of the spins into the oscillators , which thus become correlated as the time evolves .",
    "moreover , the opposite effect happens through the @xmath42 , complicating the solution of the differential equations @xmath247 where we have introduced the index @xmath248 to label the position / momentum spin - boson couplings , and the matrices @xmath249 , which have the following expression @xmath250 .",
    "it is clear that the last term in eq .  , namely @xmath251 , can not be responsible for the propagation of spin correlations , as it is just a local evolution of the spins that would be present even in the case of uncoupled oscillators .",
    "fortunately , we have already shown that this local term can be regarded as the generator of a unitary rotation  ( [ spin - rotation ] ) .",
    "hence , we may eliminate this term by defining a new set of spin - spin commutators @xmath252 , which share the norm with the original ones @xmath253 .",
    "the time - evolution for these spin commutators becomes @xmath254 \\cdot { \\mathbf{s}}_j,\\ ] ] which is simple enough such that we can derive the desired lieb - robinson bound for the spin - boson lattice model .      in analogy with the time - evolution of the bosonic operators  ,",
    "the system of differential equations for the spin - boson commutator   can be formally integrated . using the initial condition @xmath255 , which assumes that the spins and bosons are initially uncorrelated",
    ", we arrive at @xmath256 upon substitution of this result in the system of odes for the spin - spin commutators  , we find @xmath257^n \\cdot a^n_j(t ) \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_j(t).\\ ] ] integrating this equation leads to a dyson - type recurrence that only contains spin operators @xmath258^n \\cdot a^n_j(\\tau_1 ) \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_j(\\tau_1 ) .\\ ] ] we can now upper - bound the norm of the lieb - robinson commutator @xmath259 by using two properties of the operator norm , namely @xmath260 , and @xmath261 .",
    "additionally , we will exploit the fact that @xmath262 is a unitary operator , @xmath263 , and use the bound for the norm of the free bosonic propagator  .",
    "after introducing the upper bounds @xmath264 , and @xmath265 , we obtain @xmath266 where we have introduced the constant @xmath267 .",
    "we now interchange the integration order , noting that the initial integration limits are @xmath268 and @xmath269 , and defining the same integration region as @xmath270 and @xmath271 hence , @xmath272 integrating the exponential term , we now find @xmath273 let us now iterate this recurrent expression , which leads us to @xmath274 we now use the relation @xmath275 and we get @xmath276    it is possible to iterate the above expression for @xmath277 , using the equality @xmath278 , together with @xmath279 and @xmath277 which implies @xmath280 . as an example , the first three steps read @xmath281 the total sum up to infinite order reads @xmath282 with @xmath283 by direct integration , we find that @xmath284 which results in @xmath285    the previous series can be summed up to infinite order yielding the desired lieb - robinson bound   for the spin - boson lattice model @xmath286 interestingly enough , we find that the lrb for this composite system contains two contributions .",
    "on the one hand , the first exponential gives the maximum propagation speed for the bosons .",
    "since the spin correlations are built by the exchange of bosons , it is natural that the speed of propagation of spin perturbations has an upper bound given by the speed of propagation of the carriers . on the other hand ,",
    "the second exponential determines the efficiency with which distant spins can excite and reabsorb a propagating boson .",
    "accordingly , this process should be proportional to @xmath287 , the maximum spin - boson coupling strength .",
    "moreover , if the bosons travel much faster than the time - scale related to such a spin - boson coupling , an adiabatic - type argument tells us that the efficiency of excitation / reabsorption of bosons by distant spins should be reduced .",
    "therefore , we can expect that , in addition , the process should also be proportional to @xmath288 .",
    "these arguments based on a physical reasoning are confirmed by the rigorous lrb , as we have found that the argument of the second exponential is @xmath289 .",
    "in this section of the supplemental material , we present an improvement on the lrb for free bosonic lattice models found by m. cramer _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we also show how this bound enters in the full spin - boson lattice model .",
    "let us rewrite the bosonic part of the full spin - boson hamiltonian   by separating the diagonal and off - diagonal terms @xmath290 where @xmath291 , and we impose that the coupling matrices @xmath194 between different lattice sites @xmath158 decay with the distance .",
    "moreover , we also assume that the norm of such matrices can be upper bounded by @xmath292 where we use the exponent @xmath293 , and a constant @xmath294 with the units of frequency . for @xmath226 ,",
    "the couplings are more than exponentially suppressed ; for @xmath228 , we face an algebraic decay .    we can now get rid of the diagonal terms by changing into a frame in which the phase space coordinates rotate with angular speed @xmath295 @xmath296 in this frame , the system of odes for the free bosonic operators   only includes the off - diagonal couplings @xmath297 which can be alternatively written in terms of the free bosonic propagator @xmath298 in the rotated frame , such that the full propagator corresponds to @xmath299 this propagator satisfies the dyson series @xmath300 where we used @xmath301 for all @xmath302 .",
    "let us calculate the norm of this operator , and use the identities @xmath260 , and @xmath261 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath303 and @xmath304 are unitary operators , it follows that @xmath305 by using the bound on the off - diagonal couplings  , we find the expression @xmath306 which can be iterated once to obtain @xmath307 in analogy to eq .",
    ", by introducing the geometric factor @xmath308 we find directly that @xmath309 by iterating this recursion to infinite order , we can now see that the free boson propagator can be expressed as @xmath310 in this case , we find exactly that @xmath311 , such that the series can be summed to infinite order yielding @xmath312 this is precisely the lrb for the free bosonic lattice model that has been used in eq .",
    "( note that the propagator can be directly related to the lieb - robinson retarded commutators of position - momentum operators  @xcite ) .",
    "we observe that the bound inherits the decay structure of the couplings .",
    "regarding algebraically decaying couplings ( @xmath39 ) , this bound presents certain improvements with respect to the work of m. cramer _",
    "et al . _",
    "the first and most important one is that the lieb - robinson speed @xmath313 only depends on the bound of the off - diagonal couplings   thorough @xmath67 .",
    "as expected from a physical reasoning , the maximum speed with which the bosonic correlations are build up can not increase with the on - site frequencies , but must be rather limited by the off - diagonal couplings between distant oscillators .",
    "the second reason for the improvement is that our bound applies to more general bosonic lattice models , where the coupling matrix @xmath194 might depend on time , and have all types of couplings , namely position - position , position - momentum , and momentum - momentum couplings .    in this part of the supplemental material ,",
    "we describe how the system of odes for the oscillators are solved according to eq .",
    "when they contain an additional source term @xmath314 , namely @xmath315 we can solve it with the following ansatz @xmath316 , $ ] where @xmath317 is the propagator of the free bosonic system ( i.e. homogeneous system of odes ) previously bounded in eq .  .",
    "it is important to remark that we need both the starting time and the final time in @xmath20 because @xmath318 is time dependent : we have lost translational invariance in time .",
    "when we introduce this ansatz into the previous equation and impose that @xmath20 is the propagator of the free bosonic system , @xmath319 we obtain @xmath320 .",
    "this leads to the solution @xmath321 using the fact that the operators can be composed , i.e. @xmath322 , which follows from the properties of the solution of the homogeneous system of odes , we can simplify the previous expression @xmath323 finally , by considering the particular spin - dependent source term , @xmath324 , we get the desired formal solution used in eq .   above .",
    "in this section of the supplemental material , we provide a detailed description of the applicability of the lieb - robinson bound ( lrb ) for spin - boson lattice models in a trapped - ion system .      paralleling our discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : statement ] , let us start this section by describing how the general spin - boson lattice hamiltonian   can be realised in state - of - the - art experiments with trapped ions  @xcite .",

    "( i ) _ a linear paul trap , _",
    "( ii ) _ a penning trap , or _ ( iii ) _ a micro - fabricated surface trap ( see  @xcite ) . for low - enough temperatures ,",
    "the ions crystallise forming either _ (",

    ", the set of edges @xmath193 is determined by the all possible links for each lattice .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom of each vertex @xmath175 correspond to the small transverse vibrations of the ions around the equilibrium positions ( i.e. bosons ) , living in @xmath177 , and to a pair of internal levels of the atomic level structure ( i.e. spins ) , living in @xmath328 .",
    "the small transverse vibrations will be denoted as @xmath329 .",
    "they correspond to _",

    "moreover , the hamiltonian for the transverse vibrations   can be rewritten as @xmath336 which yields a transparent realisation of the free bosonic part  .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the trap frequencies could be modified dynamically in the experiment to study e.g. quenches , leading to a time - dependent @xmath194 also captured by our lrb .",
    "let us now turn into the spin degrees of freedom , which correspond to a pair of atomic levels @xmath337 with a sufficiently long coherence time . for the sake of concreteness , we select two states from the hyperfine ground - state manifold of a certain ion ( e.g. @xmath338 or @xmath339 ) , although we emphasise that the lrb   would equally apply to optical or zeeman spins ( e.g. @xmath340 or @xmath341 ) . by defining the pauli matrices @xmath342 , @xmath343 , and @xmath344 , it follows directly that the desired commutation relations   are fulfilled .",
    "we define @xmath345 as the transition frequency between the two atomic states , and use electromagnetic radiation ( e.g. a raman configuration with two co - propagating laser beams , or a single microwave in a traveling - wave configuration ) , such that its frequency fulfils @xmath346 , and @xmath347 .",

    "this requires a light - matter interaction that couples the internal states of the ions to the transverse vibrations , which can be achieved via the so - called state - dependent dipole forces .",

    "we have also defined the so - called lamb - dicke parameter @xmath355 , which depends on the gradient of the modulation of the electric ( magnetic ) field of the laser ( microwave ) at the position of the ion , and the zero - point motion of the ions . in order to get such state - dependent force , we have to consider that @xmath356 , such that @xmath357 and @xmath358 , in order to make the gradient of the light - matter interaction dominant , which leads to eq .   as opposed to the case in eq .  .",
