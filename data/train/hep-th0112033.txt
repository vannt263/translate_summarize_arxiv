    "in resent years , a great deal of work on the abelian chern - simons - higgs model in 2 + 1 dimension has been done by many physicists@xcite .",
    "this model has been widely used in many fields in physics , such as the fractional spin in quantum field theory@xcite , and the quantum hall effect in condensed matter physics@xcite . though it has been common to include the topological properties of the abelian csh vortex ,",
    "the topological structure of this vortex has not been studied strictly . in this paper ,",
    "based on the decomposition theory of gauge potential and the @xmath0-mapping theory , the inner structure of the csh vortex and its evolution will be discussed in detail .",
    "we know that the abelian csh lagrangian density in 2 + 1 dimensions is often expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the designated charged higgs scalar field and @xmath3 is so - called chern - simons term . as have been pointed out by many physicists@xcite , the magnetic flux of the vortex is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a topological index , characterizing the vortex configuration .",
    "@xmath6 is also referred to as the topological charge .    in our point of view@xcite",
    ", the @xmath7 gauge potential can be decomposed by the higgs complex scalar field @xmath8 as @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is only a phase factor , and @xmath5 is a unit vector field defined by@xmath11 it can be proved that there exists a topological current @xmath12 obviously , the current ( [ tpc ] ) is conserved . following the @xmath0-mapping theory @xcite",
    ", it can be rigorously proved that@xmath13 where the jacobian @xmath14 is defined as@xmath15    according to the @xmath16-function theory @xcite and the @xmath0-mapping theory , one can prove that @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the @xmath19-th regular zero points of @xmath20 i.e. the solution of the following equation @xmath21 and the positive integer @xmath22 is the hopf index@xcite and @xmath23 is brouwer degree@xcite .",
    "then the density of topological charge can be wrote as @xmath24 comparing the formula to ( [ ch1 ] ) and considering eq .",
    "( [ tpc ] ) , the total charge of the system given in ( [ ch1 ] ) can be rewrote as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is unit magnetic flux . and",
    "it is easy to see that the topological index @xmath5 in ( [ ch1 ] ) has the following expression @xmath27 it is obvious to see that the vortex configuration given in ( [ ch1 ] ) is a multivortex solution which possess the inner structure described by expression ( [ tal ] ) .",
    "we can see vortex corresponds to @xmath28 while anti - vortex corresponding to @xmath29",
    "as being discussed before , the zeros of the vector field @xmath30 play an important roles in describing the topological structure of the vortices .",
    "now we begin investigating the properties of the zero points . as we knew before , if the jacobian @xmath31 we will have the isolated zeros of the vector field @xmath32 however , when the condition fails , the above discussion will change in some way and lead to the branch process .",
    "we denote one of the zero points as @xmath33 if the jacobian @xmath34 we can use the jacobian @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 for the purpose of using the implicit function theorem@xcite . then we have a unique solution of the equations ( [ eq ] ) in the neighborhood of the limit point @xmath37 @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we call the critical points @xmath37 the limit points . in the present case , we know that @xmath40 i.e. , @xmath41 then , the taylor expansion of @xmath42 at the limit point @xmath43 is @xcite @xmath44 which is a parabola in @xmath45 plane . from eq.([93 ] ) we can obtain two solutions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which give two branch solutions ( worldlines of vortices ) . if @xmath48 , we have the branch solutions for @xmath49 [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] ; otherwise , we have the branch solutions for @xmath50 [ see fig .",
    "these two cases are related to the origin annihilate of the vortices .",
    "one of the result of eq .",
    "( [ wqd ] ) , that the velocity of vortices are infinite when they are annihilating , agrees with the fact obtained by bray @xcite who has a scaling argument associated with point defects final annihilation which leads to large velocity tail . from eq .",
    "( [ wqd ] ) , we also get a new result that the velocity of vortices is infinite when they are generating , which is gained only from the topology of the scalar fields .    since the topological current is identically conserved , the topological charge of these two generated or annihilated vortices must be opposite at the limit point , i.e. @xmath51 which shows that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "one can see that the fact the brouwer degree @xmath54 is indefinite at the limit points implies that it can change discontinuously at limit points along the worldlines of vortices ( from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ) .",
    "it is easy to see from fig .",
    "1 : when @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; when @xmath59 , @xmath60 .    for a limit point",
    "it is required that @xmath61 as to a bifurcation point@xcite , it must satisfy a more complex condition .",
    "this case will be discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section we have the restrictions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq ] ) at the bifurcation points @xmath62 @xmath63 which leads to an important fact that the function relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath65 is not unique in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point @xmath66 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath67 ) is indefinite at @xmath62 i.e. , the velocity field of vortices is indefinite at the point @xmath37 .",
    "this is why the very point @xmath37 is called a bifurcation point .",
    "assume that the bifurcation point @xmath37 has been found from eqs .",
    "( [ eq ] ) and ( [ det - bif ] ) . we know",
    "that , at the bifurcation point @xmath62 the rank of the jacobian matrix @xmath68 $ ] is @xmath69 in addition , according to the @xmath0-mapping theory , the taylor expansion of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point @xmath37 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath70 which leads to @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75  are three constants . the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ bifb38 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ bifa39 ] ) give different directions of the branch curves ( worldlines of vortices ) at the bifurcation point .",
    "there are four possible cases , which will show the physical meanings of the bifurcation points .",
    "case 1 ( @xmath76 ) : for @xmath77  from eq .",
    "( [ bifb38 ] ) we get two different directions of the velocity field of vortices @xmath78  which is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where two worldlines of two vortices intersect with different directions at the bifurcation point .",
    "this shows that two vortices encounter and then depart at the bifurcation point .",
    "case 2 ( @xmath76 ) : for @xmath79  from eq .",
    "( [ bifb38 ] ) we get only one direction of the velocity field of vortices @xmath80  which includes three important cases .",
    "( a ) two worldlines tangentially contact , i.e. two vortices tangentially encounter at the bifurcation point ( see fig .",
    "( b ) two worldlines merge into one worldline , i.e. two vortices merge into one vortex at the bifurcation point ( see fig .",
    "( c ) one worldline resolves into two worldlines , i.e. one vortex splits into two vortices at the bifurcation point .",
    "( see fig .",
    "3(c ) ) .",
    "case 3 ( @xmath81 ) : for @xmath79  from eq .",
    "( [ bifa39 ] ) we have @xmath82  there are two important cases : ( a ) one worldline resolves into three worldlines , i.e. one vortex splits into three vortices at the bifurcation point ( see fig .",
    "( b ) three worldlines merge into one worldline , i.e. three vortices merge into one vortex at the bifurcation point ( see fig .",
    "4(b ) ) .",
    "case 4 ( @xmath83 ) : eq .",
    "( [ bifb38 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ bifa39 ] ) gives respectively @xmath84  this case is obvious as fig . 5 and is similar to case 3 .",
    "the above solutions reveal the evolution of the vortices . besides",
    "the encountering of the vortices , i.e. two vortices encounter and then depart at the bifurcation point along different branch curves ( see fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , it also includes spliting and merging of vortices . when a multicharged vortex moves through the bifurcation point , it may split into several vortices along different branch curves ( see fig .",
    "3(c ) , fig . 4(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) ) . on the contrary",
    ", several vortices can merge into one vortex at the bifurcation point ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) , fig .",
    "4(b ) ) .    from eqs . ( [ case3 ] ) and ( [ case4 ] )",
    ", we find that there are two branches includes the case that the velocity of vortices is infinite at the bifurcation point , i.e. when one vortex splits into three vortices or three merge into one , there must exists a pair of vortices whose velocity is infinite at the bifurcation point .",
    "it seems that these cases are associated with the process of generating or annihilating .",
    "this is pointed to be verified in future .",
    "the identical conversation of the topological charge shows the sum of the topological charge of these final vortices must be equal to that of the original vortices at the bifurcation point , i.e. @xmath85 for fixed @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , from above studies , we see that the generation , annihilation and bifurcation of vortices are not gradual change , but sudden change at the critical points .",
    "firstly , we obtain the inner topological structure of chern - simons vortex",
    ". the multi - charged vortex has been found at the every zero point of the higgs scalar field @xmath0 under the condition that the jacobian determinate @xmath87 .",
    "one also shows that the charge of the vortex is determined by hopf indices and brouwer degrees .",
    "secondly , we conclude that there exist crucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of the vortices when @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 is indefinite .",
    "this means that the vortices generate or annihilate at the limit points and encounter , split or merge at the bifurcation points of the higgs scalar fields , which shows that the vortices system is unstable at these branch points .",
    "here we must point out that there exist two restrictions of the evolution of vortices .",
    "one restriction is the conservation of the topological charge of the vortices during the branch process ( see eqs .",
    "( [ chargei ] ) and ( [ chargeii ] ) ) , the other restriction is the number of different directions of the worldlines of vortices is at most four at the bifurcation points ( see eqs .",
    "( [ bifb38 ] ) , ( [ bifa39 ] ) ) .",
    "perhaps , the former is known before , but the later is pointed out for the first time .",
