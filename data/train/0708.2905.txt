    "we consider the multiple point principle ( mpp ) @xcite as a possible mechanism for the suppression of fcnc and cp  violation effects .",
    "mpp postulates the existence of the maximal number of phases with the same energy density which are allowed by a given theory @xcite .",
    "when applied to the 2hdm the multiple point principle implies the existence of a large set of degenerate vacua at some high energy scale @xmath8 ( mpp scale ) that can be parametrised as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 while @xmath13 is an arbitrary parameter . according to the mpp vacua at the electroweak and mpp scales",

    "the degeneracy of the mpp scale vacua can be achieved only if the lagrangian for the higgs  fermion interactions is invariant under symmetry transformations ( see @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are quark and lepton eigenstates which couple to @xmath18 while @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are fermion eigenstates that interact with @xmath22 . in eq .",

    "the mixing term @xmath25 , which is not forbidden by the mpp , softly breaks custodial global symmetries but does not create new sources of cp  violation or fcnc transitions .",
    "the degeneracy of the physical and mpp scale vacua requires higgs and yukawa couplings to be adjusted so that an appropriate cancellation among the quartic terms in the higgs potential ( [ 1 ] ) takes place .",
    "such cancellation becomes possible only if @xmath26 and the combination of the higgs self  couplings @xmath27 as well as its beta function @xmath28 go to zero at the scale @xmath8 @xcite . at moderate values of @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are vacuum expectation values of @xmath22 and @xmath18 in the physical vacuum ,",
    "the last two mpp conditions can be written as follows @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "thus @xmath34 and @xmath35 are not independent parameters in the considered model . as a result",
    "the mpp inspired 2hdm has less free parameters than the 2hdm of type ii and therefore can be regarded as a minimal non  supersymmetric two higgs doublet extension of the sm .",
    "it is also worth noting here that the mpp conditions ( [ 4 ] ) are satisfied identically in the mssm above the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the mpp conditions ( [ 4 ] ) must be supplemented by the vacuum stability requirements , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which have to be fulfilled everywhere from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "otherwise another minimum of the higgs potential ( [ 1 ] ) with negative vacuum energy density arises at some intermediate scale , preventing the consistent realisation of the mpp in the 2hdm .",
    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) flow of all couplings in the mpp inspired 2hdm is determined by @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath33 . when @xmath42 the solutions of the rg equations for the top quark yukawa coupling are concentrated in the vicinity of the quasi ",
