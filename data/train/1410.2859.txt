    "bose - einstein condensation was first predicted theoretically in 1924 by s.n .",
    "bose and a. einstein for noninteracting bosonic particles .",
    "its first experimental realization was only achieved in 1995 in interacting dilute atomic vapours , by e. cornell and c. wieman@xcite and independently by r. hulet@xcite and w. ketterle@xcite .",
    "this peculiar finding has since sparked significant research interest in ultracold bosonic gases and their dynamics . among the numerous unique features of becs are the superfluid properties . specifically , the nucleation and interaction of quantized vortices and turbulent behavior are of exceptional interest . quantized vorticity follows from the single - valuedness of the superfluid wavefunction and plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the becs@xcite .",
    "the understanding of quantum turbulence , i.e. the chaotic interaction of numerous quantum vortex lines , has long been sought and remains an active area of research @xcite .",
    "quantum vortices were first observed experimentally in becs in 1999 - 2000@xcite .",
    "decades earlier , the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) had been devised in order to describe vortices in superfluids@xcite .",
    "a vortex reconnection is a general phenomenon in which two vortex lines meet at a point and exchange tails . in 1987",
    "ashurst and meiron simulated the reconnections with a biot - savart model and later on , in 1993 , koplik and levine showed that quantum vortex reconnections ( qvrs ) appear in the dynamics of the gpe . in 1994 waele and aarts with a biot - savart model claimed a universal route to reconnection for all kinds of initial vortex - antivortex arrangements .",
    "more recent relevant work includes the study of vortex reconnections in untrapped superfluids@xcite , in trapped becs at finite temperatures@xcite , the computation of the minimum distance between two approaching vortices@xcite and the calculation of the energy spectra of gases with reconnecting vortices@xcite .",
    "contemporary approaches to quantum turbulence focus on drawing classical analogies and contrasting them with the quantum case . this can be considered a top - down approach to understanding turbulent dynamics , using what is already known about classical dynamics to understand quantum dynamics .",
    "today the gpe is the foremost basis for studies of quantum turbulence . yet , as a mean - field theory it neglects crucial quantum effects such as fragmentation and system correlations or even the angular symmetries of the isotropic gas@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to understanding quantum turbulence is to treat the problem in the true quantum many - body context ; study at first the dynamics of simple vortex configurations and extrapolate then to systems containing more vortices .",
    "this approach constitutes a bottom - up approach to the problem , putting the quantum dynamics at the heart of the picture .",
    "this paper treats the problem of understanding vortex dynamics with this second approach .",
    "the vast majority of previous studies of the three - dimensional vortex dynamics has been carried out in uniform systems .",
    "experiments with trapped gases however necessitate simulations of vortex interactions in non - homogeneous systems . in the present work ,",
    "we solve the many - body time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) as an initial value problem in three dimensions , for a state of the trapped gas containing two perpendicular vortices .",
    "this initial state can be created by various vortex imprint techniques ( see for instance ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the many - body method used to solve the tdse is the _ multi - configurational time - dependent hartree for bosons _ ( mctdhb)@xcite and its recursive software implementation ( r - mctdhb)@xcite .",
    "this method allows us to study the dynamical fragmentation of the system and look for beyond mean - field phenomena .",
    "we study the dynamics of the vortices for different values of the interaction strength as well as the trap anisotropy .",
    "both parameters are of experimental relevance and expected to impact the dynamical evolution of the system and , more specifically , the time to the qvr .",
    "it is found that the qvr can follow two separate paths , depending on the anisotropy of the confinement : either through tail - exchange between the two vortices in the region of high density ( isotropic or close to isotropic trap ) or at the border of the cloud , in regions of low density ( strongly anisotropic ) .",
    "the former is the standard way to qvr ( see for instance ref.@xcite ) and we call it herein ` x - reconnection ' . the latter is rather unseen before and termed ` z - reconnection ' due to the peculiar shape of the topology of the qvrs .",
    "a sketch of these distinct reconnection paths is shown in fig .",

    "we study a system of @xmath0 dilute bosons at zero absolute temperature @xmath1 that are trapped in a harmonic potential in three spatial dimensions .",
    "we solve the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation as an initial value problem where the initial state is fixed to posses two perpendicular vortex lines and evolve this state by propagating in real - time .",

    "the mctdhb method assumes a general many - body ansatz for the solution of the tdse which is an expansion over a set of many - body basis functions , also known as permanents@xcite .",
    "each of the permanents describes a condensed or fragmented system and is time - dependent . in our case",

    "it is important to note , that the vortex imprinting solely in the first orbital @xmath30 is sufficient in order to create the vortex pair in the many - body wavefunction : since in the ground state of the parabolic potential @xmath25 the first orbital occupation is larger than @xmath43 the wavefunction is almost fully determined by the orbital @xmath30 on which the vortices are imprinted",

    "[ inistate ] ) as compared to the ground state with no vortices is found to increase by a factor of approximately @xmath45 , for all choices of the interaction strength .",

    "precisely , for @xmath50 , the energy obtains a minimum at infinitely large @xmath38",

    "this signifies that for the system parameters and initial conditions studied , the time dependent gpe would be a sufficient model for the time scales presented here .",

    "indeed , in the case of @xmath47 and @xmath46 we have found that for times as long as @xmath54 the first natural occupation stays above @xmath55 . in other words , for the time scale when the first approximately @xmath56 reconnections happen the gas stays close to a condensed state .",

    "the qvr happens through a similar mechanism to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : reconnection ] , i.e. it shows an x - reconnection .",
    "however , for @xmath59 it seems that the qvr is shifted towards the edge of the condensate .",
    "the vortices , due to the anisotropy , tend to align and they follow a different path : they reconnect at regions of low density , i.e. the edge of the cloud instead of the center of the trap .",
    "the whole process has a different topology ( z - reconnection ) than the previously discussed case ( x - reconnection ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : altreconnection ] shows the z - reconnection of the strongly anisotropic gas .",
    "one sees in the central image of this figure a ` z ' shape , which occurs as one of the initial vortices has bent so much that the curved section has met the edge of the condensate bulk .",
    "this causes a break in the vortex line and forms one vertex of the ` z ' shape .",
    "simultaneously one end of the bent vortex meets the end of the other initial vortex to form the second vertex of the z shape .    .",

    "[ fig : escan ] the first qvr begin and end times are plotted as a function of @xmath61 .",

    "fig : escan ] . for large trap anisotropies",
    "the z - reconnection path remains as the reconnection method and the reconnection events happen faster as the edge of the cloud is pushed closer to the position of the initial vortex line .    a common feature that all the simulations share is the bulk oscillations during the qvr : the cloud expands and reaches a maximum at the moment of the qvr , seemingly _ in - phase _ with the qvr .",
    "furthermore , calculations for times as long as @xmath63 suggest that the repeating reconnections persist and occur indefinitely .",
    "in ref.@xcite the reader can see the videos of the real - time dynamics for the cases of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "from the results presented in this work , three main conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the first is that there is no direct connection between vortex reconnection and system fragmentation for the coherent initial state containing two orthogonal vortices .",
    "we found no significant deviations in the orbital occupations at the short time scales at which the vortex reconnection occurs . for long times",
    "the occupation of the first orbital settles at approximately little less than @xmath55 .",
    "the second conclusion is that reconnection begin and end times are unaffected by variations of the interaction strength .",
    "hence the qvr dynamics do not appear to scale in time with the interaction .",
    "in other words , as the interaction increases and the density at the center decreases the velocities of the vortices do not change . one could ask if the same behaviour persists for larger @xmath53 and very strongly repulsive gases . independently of what this answer be , we believe that this counter - intuitive result deserves more attention and is the subject of future work .",
    "the last principal conclusion is that different anisotropies can lead to different routes to reconnection which significantly change the system dynamics .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : reconnection ] and  [ fig : altreconnection ] and in the videos in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was also found that the vortex connections will occur repeatedly for long times : approximately @xmath66 qvr happen during the a time that is equal to @xmath67 trap periods .    among a handful of publications that deal with vortex reconnections in trapped becs ,",
    "the present paper is the first research into the many - body nature of vortex dynamics and reconnections in three - dimensional trapped ultracold bose gases .",
    "furthermore it is , to the best of our knowledge , the first work to numerically study vortices in highly asymmetric traps , as well as being the first work to study quantum vortices in a many - body context in three spatial dimensions . as a next step",
    ", it would be appealing to study the dynamics of _ initially fragmented _ vortices and look for many - body mechanisms of vortex reconnection , if any , that go beyond the commonly applied gross - pitaevskii mean - field method .",
