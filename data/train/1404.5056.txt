    "modes of fundamental significance to nonlinear optics  @xcite and plasmonics  plas1,plas3,plas4,plas5,plas6,plas7,plas8,plas9,marini , korea are dissipative spatial solitons that result from the simultaneous balance among diffraction , self - focusing nonlinearity , loss , and compensating gain .",
    "stability is a crucially important issue in the theoretical analysis of dissipative solitons .",
    "an obvious necessary condition for the stability of localized modes is the stability of the zero background around them .",
    "the basic complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation , which includes the bandwidth - limited linear gain and nonlinear loss acting on a single field , is unable to produce stable dissipative solitons , since the action of the linear gain on the zero background makes it unstable . on the other hand , dissipative solitons can be fully stabilized in systems of linearly coupled cgl equations  @xcite modeling dual - core waveguides , with the linear gain and loss acting in different cores  marini , dual1,dual2,dual3,dual4,dual5 , including the @xmath0-symmetric version of the system that features the balance between the gain and loss  @xcite .",
    "stable solitons can also be generated by a single cgl equation with cubic gain sandwiched \" between linear and quintic losses , which may be realized in optics as a combination of linear amplification and power - dependent absorption  cq1,cq2,cq3,cq4,cq5,cq6,cqgle1,cqgle2,cqgle3,cqgle4,cqgle5 .",
    "another method for creating stable localized modes makes use of linear gain applied at a hot spot \" ( hs , i.e. a localized amplifying region embedded into an ordinary lossy waveguide  @xcite or a bragg grating  @xcite ) .",
    "models with multiple hss  spotsexact1,spots1,spots2,spots3,spotsexact2 , and similar extended amplifying structures  @xcite , have been studied as well .",
    "hss can be built by implanting gain - producing dopants into a narrow segment of the waveguide  @xcite , or , alternatively , by focusing an external pump beam at the designated position of the hs in a uniformly - doped waveguide .",
    "in addition to models with the localized direct ( phase - insensitive ) gain , systems including the localization of parametric gain was developed as well  @xcite .",
    "dissipative solitons can be stably pinned to the hs due to the balance between the local gain and uniform loss in the bulk waveguide . for narrow hss modeled by the delta - functional distribution of the gain , solutions for the pinned dissipative solitons",
    "are available in analytical form  hsexact , spotsexact1,spotsexact2 .",
    "furthermore , models with mutually balanced gain and loss applied in the form of @xmath1-functions at separated points @xcite , or at a single location , in the form of a gain - loss dipole described by the derivative of the @xmath1-function thawatchai , make it possible to find solution for @xmath0-symmetric solitons pinned to these points .",
    "other one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) hs - pinned modes , including stable vortices fed by the gain confined to an annular - shaped area  @xcite , can be found numerically  @xcite .    while dissipative solitons in uniform media are always unstable against the blowup in the absence of the higher - order ( quintic ) nonlinear losses  kramer , ml , it is worthy to note a counter - intuitive result @xcite demonstrating that _ stable _ dissipative localized modes in uniform linearly - lossy media may be supported by _ unsaturated _ localized cubic gain alone .",
    "stable dissipative solitons were also predicted in a setting that combines the uniformly - distributed linear gain in the @xmath2-dimensional space and nonlinear loss growing from the center to periphery faster than @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate  @xcite .",
    "the class of models with the localized gain includes lattice systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the 1d model was introduced for a linear lossy lattice with a single or two amplified ( active ) sites embedded into it , which represent the hss in the discrete setting .",
    "it was assumed that the nonlinearity was carried solely by the same active sites .",
    "this system , which may be considered as a variety of discrete cgl equations discrcgl1,discrcgl2,discrcgl3,discrcgl4,discrcgl5,discrcgl6,discrcgl7,discrcgl8,discrcgl9,discrcgl10,discrcgl11 , can be implemented in the experiment using arrays of optical waveguides @xcite or arrayed plasmonic waveguides  plasmon - array1,plasmon - array2,plasmon - array3 . in particular , it suggests possibilities for selective excitation of particular core(s ) in the arrayed waveguides , if the system is uniformly doped , but only the selected cores are pumped by an external laser beam . in ref .",
    "@xcite , discrete solitons pinned to the hs in the lattice system were found in an analytical form , similar to the soliton solutions available in the discrete linear schrdinger equation with embedded nonlinear elements  @xcite , and the stability of the localized models was investigated by means of numerical methods .",
    "the present work aims to extend the analysis for the 2d lattice system , with one or two active nonlinear sites  embedded into the linear lossy bulk lattice .",
    "the experimental realization of such a 2d medium is also possible in nonlinear optics , using waveguiding arrays permanently written in bulk silica  @xcite .",
    "an essential distinction from the 1d counterpart  @xcite mentioned above is that 2d localized lattice modes can not be found analytically , even if only a single nonlinear site is embedded into the linear matrix .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrate that semi - analytical solutions can be obtained for truncated ( finite - size ) lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the discrete 2d cgl equation is introduced in sec .  [",
    "sec : gov ] .",
    "section  [ sec : trun ] presents semi - analytical results for the truncated lattices .",
    "results of the linear - stability analysis for the hs - pinned lattice solitons against small perturbations are reported in sec .",

    "the paper is concluded by sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "as said above , we consider the 2d generalization of the 1d  lattice model introduced in ref .",

    "further , @xmath11 is the linear loss in the bulk lattice , @xmath12 and @xmath13 account for the linear gain and linear potential applied at the hs site ( @xmath14 ) , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 account for the kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear loss / gain ( for @xmath17 ) acting at the hs .    in optics , the 2d discrete equation , as well as its 1d counterpart , can be derived by means of well - known methods chr , discrcgl1,discrcgl2,discrcgl3,discrcgl4,discrcgl5,discrcgl6,discrcgl7,discrcgl8,discrcgl9,discrcgl10,discrcgl11,review . in the application to 2d arrays of plasmonic waveguides , which can be built as a set of metallic nanowires embedded into a bulk dielectric plasmon - array1,plasmon - array2,plasmon - array3 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) can be derived in the adiabatic approximation , with the exciton field eliminated in favor of the photonic one .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the well - known _ staggering transformation _",
    "@xcite , @xmath18 , where the asterisk stands for the complex conjugate , simultaneously reverses the signs of @xmath13 and @xmath15 , thus rendering the self - focusing and defocusing signs of the nonlinearity , which correspond to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , mutually convertible .",
    "this circumstance is essential , in particular , for modeling arrays of plasmonic waveguides , where the intrinsic excitonic nonlinearity is always self - repulsive .",
    "below , we fix the signs of @xmath13 and @xmath15 by setting @xmath21 , i.e. the corresponding linear potential at the hs is _ attractive _ , while @xmath15 may be positive ( self - focusing ) , negative ( self - defocusing ) , or zero . unless @xmath22 , this coefficient is normalized to be @xmath23 .",
    "these two cases are considered separately below , along with the case of @xmath22 , when the nonlinearity is represented solely by the cubic dissipation localized at the hs .",
    "we seek solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) for stationary localized modes with real propagation constant @xmath24 as @xmath25outside of the hs site , @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) gives rise to the linear stationary equation,@xmath26which , unlike its 1d counterpart ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , does not admit exact analytical solutions .",
    "an approximate solution can be constructed on a truncated lattice . the simplest version of the truncation is shown in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] , where four independent amplitudes obeying eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) are defined : @xmath27 ( at the center ) , @xmath28 ( in the first rhombic layer surrounding the center ) , and @xmath29 ( two independent amplitudes in the second rhombic layer ) .",
    "the amplitudes in all other layers are neglected : @xmath30 . at @xmath31 , the so truncated eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) yields : @xmath32where central amplitude @xmath27 is defined to be real , and the complex coefficient is @xmath33    the remaining nonlinear equation ( [ eq : gl ] ) at the hs site , @xmath14 , reduces to a complex equation relating real peak intensity @xmath34 and propagation constant @xmath24:@xmath35which can be solved numerically .",
    "subsequently , the amplitudes in the surrounding layers are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 3210 ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of the truncated - lattice analysis can be improved by including more rhombic layers in the calculation . although the respective version of eqs .",
    "( [ 3210 ] ) and  ( [ 0 ] ) become more complicated , they are still easy to solve numerically . table  [ tab1 ] shows numerically found @xmath27 and @xmath36 for the different truncation settings at two different sets of parameters .",
    "naturally , convergence of the solutions for the localized modes is observed with the increase of the number of the rhombic layers .",
    ".numerical solutions for different versions of the truncated lattice at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have introduced the 2d discrete dynamical system based on the bulk linear lossy lattice , into which one or two nonlinear sites with the linear gain ( hss , hot spots \" ) are embedded .",
    "the system can be implemented in the form of an array of optical or plasmonic waveguides , admitting , in particular , selective excitation of individual cores , by the local application of the external pump to the uniformly doped array .",
    "the analysis of localized modes pinned to the hss was developed both semi - analytically ( using truncated lattices ) and numerically .",
    "it has been found that , in the case of the self - focusing nonlinearity at the single hs , the pinned modes are stable ( unstable ) when the nonlinearity acting at the hs contains the cubic loss ( gain ) . on the other hand , it is worthwhile to note that , in the case of the self - defocusing nonlinearity , the hs with an unsaturated cubic gain supports stable modes , in a rather small parameter region , and bistability occurs in the case of weak cubic loss .",
    "symmetric and antisymmetric modes pinned to dual hss were also discussed briefly .    a challenging issue for the subsequent analysis is the possibility of the existence of asymmetric modes supported by the symmetric dual hss .",
    "on the other hand , a natural extension maybe to embed one or two hss into a nonlinear lossy lattice .",
