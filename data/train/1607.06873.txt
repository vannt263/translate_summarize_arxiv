    "sample covariance matrices are fundamental objects in modern multivariate statistics . in the classical setting @xcite , for an @xmath8 matrix @xmath1 , people focus on the asymptotic properties of @xmath9 when @xmath10 is fixed and @xmath11 goes to infinity . in this case",
    "the central limit theorems and laws of large number can be applied to the statistical inference procedure .",
    "however , the advance of technology has led to high dimensional data where @xmath10 is comparable to or even larger than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this high dimensionality can not be handled with the classical multivariate statistical theory .    in modern statistical study of sample covariance matrices",
    "@xcite , the largest eigenvalues have been playing important roles in analyzing the covariance matrices .",
    "on the one hand , it is of great interest to the principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , which is a standard technique for dimensionality reduction and provides a way to identify patterns from real data . as an example , in many applications @xcite the largest eigenvalue explains most of the variance of the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue is commonly used in hypothesis testing , such as in the well - known roy s largest root test @xcite .",
    "roy s largest root test has been used not only in detecting signals from the noisy data , but also in testing the group differences in manova .",
    "therefore the distribution of the largest eigenvalue is important both in finding the second order asymptotics for the estimate in pca and in computing the power of test in hypothesis testing . for a detailed review",
    ", one can refer to @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study an @xmath8 matrix @xmath1 and the covariance matrix @xmath12 in the regime where @xmath13 are proportional to each other . in the last decades",
    ", random matrix theory has been proved to be one of the powerful tools in dealing with large dimensional covariance matrices . in the framework of random matrix theory",
    ", people managed to show that the empirical spectral distribution ( esd ) of @xmath12 converges to the marchenko - pastur ( mp ) law @xcite , and the distribution of the largest eigenvalue converges to the tracy - widom distribution under a proper @xmath14 scaling .",
    "it is notable that these results are universal , i.e. they are independent of the detailed distribution of the entries of @xmath1 .",
    "the results were first proved for wishart matrix ( i.e. the covariance matrix obtained from a data matrix @xmath1 consisting of i.i.d centered real or complex gaussian random entries ) @xcite ; later they were proved for matrices @xmath1 with entries satisfying arbitrary sub - expoenetial distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we again study the edge universality for the largest eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices and we want to relax the assumptions on the distribution of the entries in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the edge universality of covariance matrices .",
    "this was a conjecture proposed by pillai and yin @xcite , and its counterpart for wigner matrices has been proved by lee and yin in @xcite .",
    "[ def_convariance ] let @xmath15 be an @xmath16 data matrix with independent centered entries @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath0 defines an @xmath20 covariance matrix .",
    "moreover , we define the following two conditions for the matrix entries :    @xmath21 @xmath22 are i.i.d random variables with @xmath23    @xmath24 @xmath25 satisfies the following tail condition @xmath26    in this paper , we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath0 as @xmath27 .",
    "we will also use @xmath28 and its eigenvalues @xmath29 in the proof .",
    "since @xmath28 and @xmath12 share the same nonzero eigenvalues , we will simply use @xmath30 , @xmath31 , to denote the @xmath32-th eigenvalue of both @xmath28 and @xmath12 without causing any confusion .",
    "we are interested in the regime @xmath33 in this paper , we often abuse the notation a little bit and write @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "we also define the soft edge for the largest eigenvalue @xmath36 we are interested in the distribution of @xmath37 and the main result of this paper is the following theorem . for the precise statement",
    ", we refer the reader to theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "[ main_thm_simple ] for any matrix @xmath1 satisfying condition @xmath38 , @xmath39 converges weakly to the tracy - widom distribution if and only if @xmath1 satisfies condition @xmath40 .",
    "theorem [ main_thm_simple ] provides a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the edge universality of covariance matrices without assuming any other properties of matrix entries .",
    "recall that in @xcite , the authors proved that @xmath41 a.s . if the fourth moment exists . furthermore in @xcite",
    ", the finite fourth moment condition is proved to be necessary for the almost sure convergence of @xmath37 .",
    "our theorem , however , shows that the existence of finite fourth moment is not necessary for the tracy - widom fluctuation .",
    "for instance , if the entries of @xmath1 have the following probability density function @xmath42 then the fourth moment does not exist , while theorem [ main_thm_simple ] still applies .",
    "thus in this case @xmath37 does not converge to @xmath43 a.s . , but @xmath39 still converges weakly to the tracy - widom distribution . on the other hand , under the condition @xmath40 , silverstein proved that @xmath41 in probability @xcite .",
    "so theorem [ main_thm_simple ] can be regarded as an improvement of that result .",
    "the main idea of our proof basically follows from that for wigner matrices in @xcite . in @xcite , the local laws and the edge universality for covariance matrices have been proved by assuming a subexponential decay of the @xmath44 entries . using the methods in @xcite , we extend these results to the family of covariance matrices with entries having size @xmath45 for some @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath1 has support bounded by @xmath47 , see definition [ defn_support ] ) .",
    "a key observation is that if we introduce a  cutoff \" on the matrix elements at @xmath48 , then the matrix with the cutoff can well approximate the original matrix in terms of the largest singular value if and only if the condition ( [ introductioneq ] ) holds @xcite .",
    "thus a major part of this paper is devoted to extend the ",
    "small \" support @xmath47 , @xmath46 , results to the  large \" support @xmath48 case .",
    "this can be accomplished with a green function comparison method , which has been used successfully in proving the universality of wigner and covariance matrices @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we will use a lindeberg replacement strategy for the comparison .",
    "different from @xcite , where the lindeberg replacement is performed by changing columns of @xmath1 , we need to change @xmath1 entry by entry in our proof .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ main_result ] , we give the main theorem and introduce some notations and tools that will be used in our proof . in section [ sec_cutoff ] , we prove the main result using the cutoff argument . in sections [ tools ] and [ comparison ] , we prove the key lemmas and theorems that are used in section [ sec_cutoff ] . in particular , the green function comparison is performed in section [ comparison ] . in appendix",
    "[ appendix1 ] , we prove the local laws and edge universality for sample covariance matrices with small support @xmath47 for some @xmath46 .    for definiteness , in this paper",
    "we focus on the real case , i.e. all the entries @xmath44 are real .",
    "however , it is clear that our proof can be applied to the complex case after minor modifications if we assume in addition that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent centered random variables with same variance .",
    "also in this paper , we do not consider the edge universality at the hard edge ( i.e. , for the smallest singular values ) .",
    "so far , there is no conjecture about the necessary and sufficient condition for the edge universality at the hard edge .",

    "all quantities that are not explicitly constant may depend on @xmath11 , and we usually omit @xmath11 from our notations .",
