    "it is a classical fact that if @xmath0 is a connected semisimple lie group , with trivial center and no compact factors , and @xmath9 is an irreducible lattice , then either @xmath13 is finite index in @xmath14 or @xmath14 is dense in @xmath0 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "lattices in such groups @xmath0 share many properties with lattices in semisimple lie groups , but also exhibit new and unexpected phenomena ( see the surveys  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    in this setting , the one - dimensional case is @xmath1 a locally finite tree .",
    "liu  @xcite proved that the commensurator of the  standard uniform lattice \" @xmath5 is dense in @xmath16 ; here @xmath5 is a canonical graph of finite cyclic groups over the finite quotient @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , leighton  @xcite and bass  kulkarni  @xcite proved that all uniform lattices in @xmath0 are commensurable ( up to conjugacy ) .",
    "hence all uniform tree lattices have dense commensurators . in dimension two ,",
    "haglund  @xcite showed that for certain @xmath18dimensional davis complexes @xmath19 , the coxeter group @xmath20 , which may be regarded as a uniform lattice in @xmath16 , has dense commensurator .",

    "the  standard uniform lattice \" @xmath24 , defined in section  [ ss : complexes_of_groups ] below , is a canonical graph product of finite cyclic groups , which acts on @xmath1 with fundamental domain a chamber .",
    "our main result is :    let @xmath0 be the automorphism group of a locally finite regular right - angled building @xmath1 , and let @xmath5 be the standard uniform lattice in @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath25 is dense in @xmath0 .",
    "this theorem was proved independently and using different methods by haglund  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we show in section  [ s : norm ] below that for all @xmath16 with @xmath1 a locally finite polyhedral complex ( not necessarily a building ) , and all uniform lattices @xmath9 , the normalizer @xmath12 is discrete .",
    "hence for @xmath0 as in the density theorem , the density of @xmath26 does not come just from the normalizer .    for most regular right - angled buildings @xmath1 ,",
    "it is not known whether all uniform lattices in @xmath16 are commensurable ( up to conjugacy ) .",
    "witkowski  @xcite have established commensurability of a class of lattices in @xmath0 which includes @xmath5 , where each such lattice is a graph product of finite groups . hence by the density theorem , each such lattice has dense commensurator . for bourdon",

    "thus by the density theorem , all uniform lattices in @xmath0 have dense commensurators . on the other hand , for @xmath1 a product of two trees , burger  mozes  @xcite constructed a uniform lattice @xmath29 which is a simple group .",
    "it follows that @xmath30 , which is discrete .",
    "thus there are cases ( when @xmath31 ) in which not all uniform lattices @xmath32 have dense commensurators .",
    "in fact , it is an open problem to determine whether the only possibilities for @xmath14 are discreteness or density . as for commensurators of nonuniform lattices in @xmath16 , hardly anything is known , even for @xmath1 a tree ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "if the building @xmath1 can be equipped with a @xmath33 metric , then the density theorem may be combined with the commensurator superrigidity theorem of burger  mozes  @xcite for @xmath33 spaces , to give rigidity results for lattices in @xmath16 which are commensurable to @xmath5 .",
    "regular right - angled buildings with piecewise hyperbolic @xmath33 metrics exist in arbitrarily high dimensions  @xcite .",

    "we then construct a canonical uniform lattice @xmath6 with fundamental domain the ball @xmath35 , and show that @xmath6 is a finite index subgroup of @xmath5 . by considering the restriction of @xmath42 to @xmath35 , we are then able to build a uniform lattice @xmath43 which contains a suitable element @xmath41 . by our construction ,",

    "thus @xmath43 is commensurable to @xmath5 , and so @xmath41 lies in @xmath26 , as required .    our lattices @xmath6 and @xmath43 are fundamental groups of complexes of groups ( see  @xcite and section  [ ss : complexes_of_groups ] below ) .",
    "the finite index lattice inclusions on the left of figure  [ f : lattice_inclusions ] are induced by finite - sheeted coverings of complexes of groups , as shown on the right of figure  [ f : lattice_inclusions ] .",
    "the necessary covering theory for complexes of groups is recalled in section  [ ss : covering_theory ] below ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    to construct the sequence of lattices @xmath6 , in section  [ s : unfolding ] below we introduce a new tool , that of _ unfoldings _ of complexes of groups .",
    "the standard uniform lattice @xmath5 may be viewed as the fundamental group of a complex of groups @xmath44 over a chamber @xmath45 of @xmath1 . by",
    " unfolding \" along `` sides '' of successive unions of chambers starting from @xmath45 , and defining new local groups appropriately , we obtain a canonical family of complexes of groups @xmath46 over the combinatorial balls @xmath47 .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath6 of @xmath46 is a uniform lattice in @xmath15 , and each @xmath6 is a finite index subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "we prove these properties of unfoldings inductively by combinatorial arguments , involving careful consideration of the local structure of @xmath1 , together with facts about coxeter groups , and the definition of a building as a chamber system equipped with a @xmath20distance function ( see section  [ ss : rabs ] ) .",
    "the other main tool in our proof of the density theorem is that of _ group actions on complexes of groups _ , which was introduced by the second author in  @xcite ( see section  [ ss : group_actions ] below ) .",
    "this theory is used to construct the sequence of lattices @xmath43 , containing suitable elements @xmath41 , as fundamental groups of complexes of groups @xmath48 such that there are finite - sheeted coverings @xmath49 .",
    "we describe in section  [ ss : new_lattices ] below how our two main tools , unfoldings and group actions on complexes of groups , may be combined to construct many uniform lattices in addition to the sequences @xmath6 and @xmath43 used in the proof of the density theorem . to our knowledge ,",

    "paulin  @xcite .",
    "the second main result of section  [ s : applications ] is :    [ t : transitive ] let @xmath0 be the automorphism group of a regular right - angled building @xmath1 .",
