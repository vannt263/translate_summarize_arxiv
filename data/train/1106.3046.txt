    "computational universality of conway s game of life ( gol ) cellular automaton  @xcite has been already demonstrated by various implementations .",
    "most famous designs are realization of functionally complete set of logical functions  @xcite , register machine  @xcite , direct simulation of turing machine  @xcite , and design of a universal constructor  @xcite .",
    "these implementations use principles of collision - based computing  @xcite where information is transferred by localizations ( gliders ) propagating in an architecture - less , or ` free , ' space .",
    "the theoretical results regarding gol universality is only the first half - step in a long journey towards real - world implementation of the collision - based computers as unconventional computing @xcite .",
    "controllability of signals is the first obstacle to overcome . despite their mind - whirling elegance and complexity - wise efficiency of implementation the ` free - space '",
    "computing circuits are difficult to fabricate in physical or chemical materials  @xcite because propagating localizations ( solitons , breathers , kinks , wave - fragments ) are notoriously difficult to manipulate , maintain and navigate .",
    "the easiest way to control patterns propagating in a non - linear medium circuits is to constrain them geometrically . constraining the media",
    "geometrically is a common technique used when designing computational schemes in spatially extended non - linear media .",
    "for example ` strips ' or ` channels ' are constructed within the medium ( e.g. excitable medium ) and connected together , typically using arrangements such as @xmath1-junctions .",
    "fronts of propagating phase ( excitation ) or diffusive waves represent signals , or values of logical variables . when fronts interact at the junctions some fronts annihilate or new fronts emerge .",
    "the propagations in the output channels represent results of the computation .",
    "the geometrical - constraining approach is far from being graceful ( particularly , comparing to collision - based paradigm  @xcite ) but simple and practical enough to be used by experimental scientists and engineers .",
    "the geometrical constraining is successfully applied in design of several laboratory prototypes of chemical ( all based on belousov - zhabotinsky reaction ) computing devices : logical gates  @xcite , diodes  @xcite , counters  @xcite , coincidence detectors  @xcite , and memory  @xcite .    what members of gol family offer us most ` realistic ' approximation of dynamical processes in spatially extended chemical computers ? in its original form , gol automaton is a discrete analog of sub - excitable chemical media  @xcite .",
    "localized wave - fragments ( reaction - diffusion dissipative solitons ) in sub - excitable belousov - zhabotinsky reaction  @xcite are represented by gliders  @xcite in gol cellular automaton .",
    "see examples of direct comparisons between experimental chemical laboratory results and cellular automaton models in @xcite .",
    "there is also a family of life - life rules , where ` cells never die , ' the state ` 1 ' is an absorbing state .",
    "this is the family of _ life without death _ ( lwd ) , invented by griffeath and moore in  @xcite . in the lwd automaton",
    "we observe propagating patterns , formed due to rule - based restrictions on propagation similar to that in sub - excitable chemical media and plasmodium of _ physarym polycephalum _",
    "@xcite , but no complicated periodic structures or global chaotic behavior occurs .",
    "the lwd family of cell - state transition rules is an automaton equivalent of the precipitating chemical systems .",
    "this is demonstrated in our phenomenological studies of semi - totalistic and precipitating ca  @xcite , where we selected a set of rules life @xmath2 , identified by periodic structures  @xcite .",
    "the clans closest to the family @xmath2 are _ diffusion rule _ ( life rule @xmath3 )  @xcite , all they also into of a big cluster named as life @xmath4 .",
    "in present chapter we study a life - like cellular automaton , which somewhat imitates properties of both excitable and precipitating reaction - diffusion chemical systems , and who how to implement a sensible computation in such type of cellular automata .",
    "we develop a model where the channels are constructed using static patterns and computation is implemented by propagating patterns of precipitation .",
    "the results are based on our previous studies of reaction - diffusion analogs @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "life rule @xmath0 is described as follows .",
    "each cell takes two states ` 0 ' ( ` dead ' ) and ` 1 ' ( ` alive ' ) , and updates its state depending on its eight closest neighbors :    1 .",
    "birth : a central cell in state 0 at time step @xmath7 takes state 1 at time step @xmath8 if it has exactly two neighbors in state 1 .",
    "survival : a central cell in state 1 at time @xmath7 remains in the state 1 at time @xmath8 if it has two , three , four or five live neighbors .",
    "death : all other local situations .",
    "once a resting lattice is perturbed ( few cells are assigned live states ) , patterns of states 1 emerge , grow and propagate on the lattice quickly .",
    "a general behavior of rule @xmath0 can be well described by a mean field polynomial and its fixed points .",
    "mean field theory is a proved technique for discovering statistical properties of ca without analyzing evolution spaces of individual rules  @xcite .",
    "the method assumes that elements of the set of states are independent , uncorrelated between each other in the rule s evolution space .",
    "therefore we can study probabilities of states in neighborhood in terms of probability of a single state ( the state in which the neighborhood evolves ) , thus probability of a neighborhood is the product of the probabilities of each cell in the neighborhood .    the mean field polynomial for rule @xmath0 is as follows :    @xmath9    .,scaledwidth=72.0% ]    high densities of regions dominated by state 1 correspond to maximum point near @xmath10 .",
    "the average density is reached with one stable fixed point @xmath11 when automaton find its stability around of 37% of cells in state ` 1 . '",
    "some interesting behavior can be found in extreme unstable fixed point when @xmath12 ( complex class , see mean field classification in @xcite ) .",
    "looking on configurations with less than 4% of cells in state ` 1 ' we can observer gliders , oscillators , and still life patterns .",
    "thus unstable fixed points ( fig .  [ meanf-1 ] ) represent evidence of complex behavior as mobile localizations , gliders and small oscillators emerging in the automaton development .",
    "figure  [ meanf-2 ] demonstrates a typical evolution of @xmath0 starting with very small initial densities of state ` 1 . '",
    "mobile localizations emerge but do not survive for a long time .",
    "a set of minimal particles , or basic periodic structures , in rule @xmath0 include one glider , two oscillators ( one blinker and one flip - flop configurations ) , and one still life configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ basicpatterns ] ) .",
    "the still life patterns @xcite represent precipitation of an abstract reaction - diffusion chemical system imitated by rule @xmath0 automaton .",
    "the still life blocks are not affected by their environment however they do affect their environment  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the still life patterns can be used to build channels , or wires , for signal propagation .      some patterns amongst still life patterns in the rule @xmath0 belong to a class of _ indestructible patterns _ ( sometimes referred to as ` glider - proof ' patterns ) which can not be destroyed by any perturbation , including collisions with gliders . a minimal indestructible pattern , still life occupying a square of @xmath13 cells , is shown in fig .",
    "[ basicpatterns]d .",
    "the indestructible patterns discovered can be used to stop a supernova explosions in life - like rules .",
    "usually a life - like automaton development started at an arbitrary configuration exhibits unlimited growth ( generally related to nucleation phenomenon @xcite ) .    in rule @xmath0",
    "such an ` uncontrollable ' growth can be prevented by a regular arrangement of indestructible patterns .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ supernova ] . in the first example ( fig .",
    "[ supernova]a ) two gliders collide inside a ` box ' made of still life patterns .",
    "the collision between the gliders lead to formation of growing pattern of ` 1 ' states .",
    "the propagation of the pattern is stopped by the indestructible localizations ( fig .",
    "[ supernova]b ) . in the second example , gliders collide outside the box ( fig .  [ supernova]c ) however interior of the box remains resting ( fig .",
    "[ supernova]c ) due to impenetrable walls .",
    "similarly , one can construct a colony of still life patterns immune to local perturbations .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ virus ] .",
    "the indestructibility exemplified above allows us to use still life patterns to channel information in logical circuits .",
    "we built a computing scheme from channels  long areas of ` 0'-state cells walled by still life blocks , and @xmath1-junctions - junction based control signals were suggested also in von neumann  @xcite works . ]",
    " sites where two or more channels join together .",

    "[ tsystem ] ) .",
    "such type of circuitry has been already used to implement xor gate in chemical laboratory precipitating reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite , and precipitating logical gates imitated in ca  @xcite .",
    "a minimal width of each channel equals three widths of the still life block ( fig .",
    "[ basicpatterns]d ) and width of a glider ( fig .",
    "[ basicpatterns]a ) .",
    "boolean values are represented by reaction of gliders , positioned initially in the middle of channel , value 0 ( fig .  [ wave - comp-1 ] ( a ) ) , or slightly offset , value 1 ( fig .",
    "[ wave - comp-1 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the initial positions of the gliders determine outcomes of their reaction .",
    "glider , corresponding to the value 0 is transformed to a regular symmetric pattern , similar to frozen waves of excitation activity ( fig .",
    "[ wave - comp-1]b ) .",
    "glider , representing signal value 1 , is transformed to transversally asymmetric patterns ( fig .",
    "[ wave - comp-1]d ) .",
    "both patterns propagate inside the channel with constant , advancing unit of channel length per step of discrete time .",
    "when patterns , representing values 0 and 1 , meet at @xmath1-junctions they compete for the output channel . depending on initial distance between gliders , one of the patterns wins and propagates along the output channel .",
    "figures  [ orgate ] ,  [ andgate ] and  [ notgate-1 ] show final configurations of basic logical gates .    figure  [ orgate ] shows two implementations of or gate . due to different locations of gliders in initial configurations of gates , patterns in both implementations of gates",
    "are different however , results of computation are the same . configurations of and gate are shown in fig .",
