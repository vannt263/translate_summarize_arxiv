    "heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies create matter at extreme conditions of temperature and energy density , consisting of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "the major motivations of facilities at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern and fair at gsi are to study the formation of this new form of matter , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and study its basic properties . in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram , location of the qcd critical point could be one of the compelling discovery in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the end point of the first order phase transition between hadronic matter to qgp phase is known as qcd critical point , after which there is no genuine phase transition but a cross over from hadronic to quark - gluon degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "while the temperature for this crossover transition at zero baryon chemical potential is now theoretically established from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) computations  @xcite , the existence and location of the critical point at non - zero baryon density is far from settled  @xcite . on the experimental front , the ongoing beam energy scan program at rhic is attempting to establish the onset of phase transition and locate the critical point .",
    "one of the foremost methods for the critical point search is through measurements of fluctuations of conserved quantities  @xcite .",
    "these quantities have been estimated theoretically - both on the lattice  @xcite as well as in models  @xcite .",
    "recently , rhic experiments have published results on the diagonal susceptibilities of conserved charges , like , net electric charge  @xcite and net baryon  @xcite .",
    "comparison of the experimental data to hrg model calculation  @xcite shows that at higher beam energies ( @xmath0  @xmath1  gev ) there is reasonably good agreement between data and the model .",
    "this suggests that at these energies , the observed fluctuation of conserved charges must be grand - canonical thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , at lower energies there is disagreement between data and model calculation for certain conserved charge susceptibilities indicating non - thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is not yet clear whether such non - thermal behaviour is a signature of qcd critical physics .",
    "similar to the diagonal susceptibilities , different combinations of higher order off - diagonal susceptibilities of net charge , net baryon number and net strangeness can be estimated using different combinations of higher order central moments of conserved charges in the experiments .",
    "the measurement of these observables give information to explore the flavor carrying susceptibilities and also the nature of qcd phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "there are several constraints in the experimental measurements which need to be properly understood in order to interpret the results and compare with theoretical calculations .",
    "a limited set of produced particles are measured on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the neutron , whose contribution to net baryon ( @xmath2 ) is as good as the proton ( @xmath3 ) , is not measured .",
    "@xmath4-baryon is the lightest strange baryon and hence contributes most significantly to the baryon - strangeness correlation .",
    "although @xmath4-baryon is measured over an ensemble through its charged daughter particles , its measurement on an event - by - event level poses a daunting task .",
    "thus , only the moments of net charge ( @xmath5 ) are measured faithfully . for the other charges we have to rely on proxies , e.g. net proton serves as a good proxy for net baryon and net kaons",
    "serve as a proxy for net strangeness .",
    "we have studied the dependence on the observed particle sets for all the second order susceptibilities .",
    "we have made a comprehensive study of the effect due to finite number of the conserved quantities .",
    "ideally , in order to observe grand canonical fluctuations of the conserved charges , the fraction @xmath6 of the conserved charge carried by the system to that of the total available charge carried by the bath as well as the system should be much smaller than half ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , in reality for full overlap collisions , the @xmath2 equals to twice the mass number of the nucleus and @xmath8 equals to twice the atomic number of the nucleus that are distributed in the momentum rapidity ( @xmath9 ) direction within @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the final distribution of this @xmath11 and @xmath5 into the system and bath depends on three factors : ( a ) the available experimental acceptance , ( b ) @xmath0 , and ( c ) the baryon stopping phenomenon which decides the initial rapidity distribution of the conserved charges .",
    "it is important to note that the strong @xmath0  dependence of baryon stopping rubs off on to @xmath6 , complicating the comparison of measured moments at different @xmath0 .    in this article",
    ", we have used the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd v3.3 ) as well as the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model to analyze the diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities of the conserved charges .",
    "model descriptions for urqmd and hrg are presented in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the observables used for the present study . in section iv",
    ", we present the collision energy dependence of all the susceptibilities .",
    "we discuss the species dependence on the observables and effect of detector acceptances .",
    "we present the results from both the models .",
    "the article is summarised in section v. an appendix at the end discusses the estimation of statistical errors associated with the observables .",
    "urqmd is a microscopic transport model  @xcite . in this model , the space - time evolution of the fireball",
    "is studied in terms of excitation of color strings which fragment further into hadrons , the covariant propagation of hadrons and resonances which undergo scatterings and finally the decay of all the resonances .",
    "this model setup has been quite successful and widely applied in heavy - ion phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "it has also been previously used to compute several susceptibilities  @xcite .",
    "the acceptance window plays an important role in such studies .",
    "the initial distribution of @xmath11 and @xmath5 in @xmath9 is a consequence of the baryon stopping phenomenon which has a strong @xmath0   dependence- as a result at higher @xmath0  the mid - rapidity region is almost free of @xmath11 and @xmath5 while at lower @xmath0  almost all the @xmath11 and @xmath5 are deposited in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "this is also expected to have significant effect on the fluctuations of conserved quantities .",
    "this @xmath0   dependent baryon stopping phenomenon is dynamically included in the urqmd approach . here",
    ", we have generated around a million events per beam energy from @xmath0  @xmath12 gev .",
    "we have compared the urqmd results with those from a thermal approach , by using the hrg model .",
    "here it is important to note that while the hrg results are expected to reflect the susceptibilities at the time of chemical freezeout where inelastic collisions cease , the urqmd results reveal the above quantities at the kinetic freezeout surface where the elastic collisions cease .",
    "thus , while the latter are more realisitic in the context of heavy ion collisions , the hrg results here serve as useful guide for a qualitative understanding of the results .",
    "the hrg model consists of all hadrons and resonances as listed in the particle data book  @xcite within the framework of a multiple species non - interacting ideal gas in complete thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the only parameters are the temperature @xmath13 , chemical potentials @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 corresponding to the conserved quantities of baryon number @xmath17 , electric charge @xmath18 and strangeness @xmath19 , and the volume @xmath20 of the fireball which are obtained by fits to data . the hrg model has been found to provide a very good description of the mean hadron yields using a few thermodynamic parameters at freeze - out ( for a recent compilation of the freeze - out parameters , see ref .",

    "up to the second order , this relationship is one - to - one , such as , ^11_xy = m^11_xy .",
    "[ eq.sustomom ] using this relation , all the diagonal and non - diagonal susceptibilities of second order can be expressed in terms of second order central moments ( @xmath35 ) :    @xmath36    the ratios of of @xmath37 to @xmath38 can be suitably constructed to cancel the volume effect . in the quasiparticle picture of quarks and gluons , the ratios @xmath39 and",

    "however the contribution from the lightest strange baryon @xmath4 to @xmath50 keeps growing with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this results in the monotonic increasing trend for @xmath45 with @xmath0 .",
    "finally , the weak rising trend of @xmath46 with decreasing @xmath0  can be traced to the contribution from the multiply charged @xmath51 to the numerator .",

    "thus , the interpretation of conserved charge fluctuations in terms of thermal and critical fluctuations is not straightforward in such cases .",

    "<S> susceptibilities of conserved quantities , such as baryon number , strangeness and electric charge are sensitive to the onset of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition , and are expected to provide information on the matter produced in heavy - ion collision experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a comprehensive study of the second order diagonal susceptibilities and cross correlations has been made within a thermal model approach of the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model as well as with a hadronic transport model , urqmd . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed analysis of the effect of detector acceptances and choice of particle species in the experimental measurements of the susceptibilities for heavy - ion collisions corresponding to @xmath0  =  4  gev to 200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse momentum cutoff dependence of suitably normalised susceptibilities are proposed as useful observables to probe the properties of the medium at freezeout . </S>"
